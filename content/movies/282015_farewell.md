The story unfolds through Audrius\u2019 journey and his many encounters over the weekend as autumn turns to winter. He is driven by a severe lack of time. Inadequate actions and reactions make sense when we find out his secret: he\u2019s dying of Leukemia. During his grandmother\u2019s birthday in her countryside village, surrounded by his family and after reassuring his son, he makes a final attempt to find resolve and peace. Farewell is a moving universal tale, uplifting and heart warming, verbally laconic and visually rich. It is a clear-cut story of the human spirit, which is both relentless and immortal.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iykNZMnVWIEqlQepTJ7zgksp3jt.jpg", "actors": ["Dainius Kazlauskas (Audrius)", "Olga Generalova (Rasa)", "Aleksandra Metalnikova ()", "Lina Budzeikait\u0117 ()", "Vladimiras Jefremovas ()", "Dalia Storyk ()", "Remigijus Vilkaitis ()", "Olegas Ditkovskis ()", "Arvydas Dap\u0161ys ()", "Larisa Kalpokait\u0117 ()", "Petras Steponavi\u010dius ()", "D\u017eiugas Siaurusaitis ()", "Kostas Smoriginas ()", "Ar\u016bnas Sakalauskas ()", "Jolanta Dapk\u016bnait\u0117 ()", "Rimantas Jovas ()", "Vaidotas Martinaitis ()", "Martynas Donela ()", "Kristina Kazlauskait\u0117 ()", "Albinas Keleris ()", "Alvydas \u0160lepikas ()", "Enrikas Ka\u010dinskas ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "HR8Lb1cT-p4"}
