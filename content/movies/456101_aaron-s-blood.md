I know that there's not a lot to be done about those, but the end result is some palpable potential that unfortunately has to go by the way side, leaving an \"only okay\" movie in its place.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}], "recommandations_id": []}
