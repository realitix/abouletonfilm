The location chosen for three summer days is a park in Hamburg full of huge old trees. While sitting on a white bench, Bernhard talks about dark childhood memories, his youth, and his struggles with writing. A striking element is his high praise of obstacles as \"material for the brain.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qKHIhYfmOZROdX1vsDAcJSdMAx2.jpg", "actors": ["Thomas Bernhard (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
