She decides to protect her triplets from the scheming leader of rival world Zephyr, General Norak, by sending her children to faraway Earth. Two decades later, the lives of the three estranged siblings intersect in the most unexpected way. Everything they know and love is suddenly threatened when General Norak zeroes in on them from light years away. The spiteful alien wants unconditional, uncontested power over Xenoa, but he is unable to achieve this as long as the true heirs to the throne are still alive. He is so hellbent on ruling Xenoa that he doesn't think twice about turning sibling against sibling in his quest for power.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7D7bKBllCdg9Zpl4gcg8otJjhlK.jpg", "actors": ["Isabel Granada (Eli)", "Paolo Ballesteros (Zeus)", "Rafael Nanquil (Drix)", "Geryk Genasky Aguas (Dennis)", "Clementine Poblete (La'ian / Lilia)", "Ronnie Martinez (Norak)", "Lesley Leveriza (Amanda)", "Marq Dollentes (Alien Actor)", "Sophia Casta\u00f1eda (Bar Customer)", "Michael Poblete (Chevrolet Driver)", "Apollo Abraham (Drix's Foster Father)", "Hiyasmin Neri (Jane)", "Katsuji Kikuchi (John Yan)", "Monette Rosello (Land Lady)", "Alan Marasigan (Mr. Legazpi)", "Lily Chu (Martha)", "Daniel Magisa (Mayor Villaruel)", "P.J.
