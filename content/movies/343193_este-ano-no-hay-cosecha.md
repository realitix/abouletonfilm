Through the narrative and experiences of the protagonists, we discover the Latin American marginality hidden beneath a contemporary city like Santiago de Chile. The camera turns into another one of the group, eventually becoming part of this type of family life born from the tight friendship with which these kids survive.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
