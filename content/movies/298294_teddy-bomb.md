He can't get rid of it, he can't go to the police, and there's no way in hell he can turn it off. To add insult to injury, the bomb's original owners want their property back and they'll decapitate, gut and eviscerate everyone that gets in their way. Whether Christian diffuses the bear or not - it's guaranteed that things will end in one big bloody bang.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4qm2u95bJgjOcqFZn0RQgyBttD6.jpg", "actors": ["Christian Murdoch (Christian)", "Jenny Lemberg (Jenny)", "Peter Kuplowsky (The Man in the Hat)", "Justin Decloux ()", "Adam Thorn (Sideshow)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
