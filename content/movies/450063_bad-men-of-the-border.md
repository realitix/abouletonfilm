The series, Universal's last attempt at competing with Republic Pictures' many streamlined B-Westerns, also featured the bucolic Fuzzy Knight as Grant's sidekick. Grant and Knight are undercover U.S. marshals tracking down a gang of counterfeiters. To their surprise, they are soon assisted by a beautiful Mexican dancehall performer, Dolores Mendoza (Armida), who proves to be an undercover agent as well, in her case for the Mexican rurales headed by Captain Garcia (Francis McDonald).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rLRmGmLt0UruFOi5BPbeIq1fGV7.jpg", "actors": ["Kirby Grant (Ted Cameron)", "Fuzzy Knight (Mortimer P.
