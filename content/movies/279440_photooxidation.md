Light increases its oxidation state, at the same time it releases free radical electrons. Light goes through human work as a natural photodegradation. It mutates within its own limits, from a solar irradiation to its impossible perception in an absent retina.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n3dKRxlCcGcNOoGHlmRtO7AvNTy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
