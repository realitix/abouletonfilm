Unfortunately in his search, he has his usual amount of luck. As Charlie Brown is watching a football game, he spots a girl in the stands that he immediately attaches himself to. When the game ends, he is desperate to find her, so he enlists Linus to help him and, because of his absolute nervousness, to do the talking for him. However, that move could wind up spelling doom for the love-starved Charlie Brown once they finally find her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7AXplNk8nTo5NSYBAXQgm8eC8d7.jpg", "actors": ["Grant Wehr (Charlie Brown (voice))", "Jennifer Gaffin (Little Girl (Mary Jo) (voice))", "Rocky Reilly (Linus van Pelt (voice) (as Earl Reilly))", "Melissa Strawmyer (Teenager (voice) (as Melissa Strawmeyer))", "Nicole Eggert (Loretta (voice))", "Bill Melendez (Snoopy / Woodstock (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [54912, 31732], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
