With cutting-edge imagery from the world's most powerful telescopes, The Search for Life in Space takes audiences from the surface of Mars and the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn, to the extreme lava fields of Hawaii and thermal vents deep beneath the sea. In these harsh environments, astrobiologists look for clues to how life takes hold. As this immersive adventure into the universe reveals the possibility of planets like ours, The Search for Life in Space will make you re-examine such fundamental questions as: \"Where did we come from?\", \"How did we get here?\" and \"Are we alone?\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/osEtAOBEk7DZFSmQ12Pt7TKq0lI.jpg", "actors": ["Lisa Kaltenegger (Presenter)", "Malcolm McDowell (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
