Over the course of her career, she revolutionized modern dance, generated what later became known as performance art, and changed the basic tenets of experimental filmmaking - all during a time when women were largely ignored in the art world. Today she continues to push forward, creating vibrant, courageous, unpredictable work, inspiring a new generation of artists to question, overthrow, and generate possibilities of their own. Feelings Are Facts: The Life of Yvonne Rainer is the story of this remarkable artist and the equally remarkable times that shaped her creative practice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/soePdYfy8MDWgpVP0R5OuQvQYIL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
