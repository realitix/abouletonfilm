Women and men dance, desire, interact; their perfectly choreographed body game becomes a symbiotic extension of an excessively hedonistic sub- conscious. Amidst it all: a mafia boss seeks to take control of the establishment and finds the meaning of life in the process. Perfect Garden is a fabulously hypnotic film, utopian and realistic all at once", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8KK7OuD7ZUy5zeIBlUTzuPe9EUR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
