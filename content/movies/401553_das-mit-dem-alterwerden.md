We are the generation that now has to learn to fit in the shoes of grown-ups.  We are the generation \"not-as-young-as-we-thought-we-were\"  - Y.  This documentary tells our journey through the different generations and which milestones our lives hold from the viewpoint of a modern \"social and connected\" society.  We met people of the generations before and after us, to find out what matters to them, what unites them and also divides them. We talked about communication, family, work and aging. We learned about ways of life, dreams and goals.  This isn\u2019t just a movie about generations. This is a movie about finding one\u2019s place.  This is a movie about growing up, growing old and everything in between.  This is a movie about life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3X2qhORl7K6sjGGJhVE3Wtu2FPb.jpg", "actors": ["Nadine Baumgartner (Herself)", "Wolfgang Baumgartner (Himself)", "Lisa Leonhartsberger (Herself)", "Reinhard Leonhartsberger (Himself)", "Paul Lehner (Himself)", "Philipp Ikrath (Expert)", "Sigrid Stagl (Expert)", "Franz Kolland (Expert)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
