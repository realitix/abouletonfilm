Constructed hundreds of years ago during the Inca Empire, this vast transportation network still weaves its way through modern-day Peru and Ecuador. More so than other remnants of the Inca civilization, Qhapaq \u00d1an is a symbol of a common identity that nourishes the dream of the Andean people to this day - to revive their cultural inheritance following centuries of European domination. As this visually striking documentary takes us along the Great Inca Road - revealing its contours, its history, and its secrets - we witness a different image of the Andes and its people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/optDq3JZHeNcT85Axaas6aoDohi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
