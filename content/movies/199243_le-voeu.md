The older of the siblings, Tanilo (Victor Manuel Mendoza) is a well-to-do family man; the other, Estaban (Jamie Fernandez), is one step above a wastrel. When Tanilo is felled by illness, Estaban is forced to take over the family's blacksmith business. He also inaugurates a romance with Tanilo's attractive young wife Juana (Lilia Prado). Punishment is eventually doled out in a manner which suggests that God Himself is exacting retribution on the adulterous couple. Originally released at 87 minutes, Talpa was pared down to 73 minutes for American consumption.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qkYiIva8cjPfjQfWpoqOBlbo3Vr.jpg", "actors": ["Lilia Prado (Juana)", "V\u00edctor Manuel Mendoza (Tanilo)", "Jaime Fern\u00e1ndez (Esteban)", "Hortensia Santove\u00f1a (La m\u00e8re)", "Leonor Llaus\u00e1s (La presumida)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
