He was 10 years old and defined himself as a messenger from other planets.\r The book became a bestseller in Argentina and was translated into six languages, launching a media boom that turned Flavio into a New Age phenomenon.\r Twenty years later, Flavio decides to re\u00adpublish his book and agrees to be part of a documentary about his story. After a year\u2019s shooting, Flavio, unhappy with the pre\u00adestablished roles of the movie, comes up with the idea of switching roles between himself and the director. If his demand is not met, he will abandon the film. Flavio\u2019s questioning leads to a change in the course of action: \u201cSolar\u201d is no longer a movie about Flavio and his family, but a power battle between director and subject.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xy4XHNfiZyiVAegYE3FRviYNgnJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
