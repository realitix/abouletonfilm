He chews out Mama; she tells him if he doesn't like the housekeeping, he can do it himself, and storms out. What follows is pretty much the usual bunch of man-keeping-house jokes: a voracious vacuum, an overflowing sink, crashing dishes, and a dozen crises at once. And still no buttons on the pants.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nxXjaIx0vyYHFuekOmpkq4jSIoW.jpg", "actors": ["Billy Bletcher (Captain (voice) (uncredited))", "Martha Wentworth (Mama (voice) (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
