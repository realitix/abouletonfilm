Holding her Super 8mm camera, she takes note of graphic explosions of dark and light and an occasional skyscraper. The stark black lines of the trees against the whiteness create the sensation of a painter's chiaroscuro. Woven into this cinematic landscape, we hear sound artist Stephen Vitiello's delicate yet soaring musical track which seems to wind its way across the frozen ground, up the tree trunks to the sky.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/16pKcKJGGgpe5HEPZwmdodLGHF0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
