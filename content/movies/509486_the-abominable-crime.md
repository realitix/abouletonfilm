Spanning five countries, THE ABOMINABLE CRIME explores the impacts of homophobia through the eyes of two gay Jamaicans who are forced to choose between their homeland and their lives. Simone, a young lesbian mother, survives being shot outside of her home by anti-gay gunmen. She must choose between living in hiding with her daughter in Jamaica or traveling alone to seek safety and asylum abroad. Maurice, Jamaica's leading gay-rights activist, is outed shortly after filing a lawsuit to overturn Jamaica's anti-sodomy law. He escapes to Canada, but decides to return to continue his activism.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1dwmPCKihfKSpOvir6GCVxqMk8q.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
