Burnett. It stars Tyrone Power, Dana Andrews, Anne Baxter, James Gleason, May Whitty and Harry Morgan. A Technicolor production out of 20th Century Fox, music is by David Buttolph and cinematography by Leon Shamroy.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s flag waving time, 1943 style as Power and Andrews vie for the love of Baxter whilst conducting a submarine offensive against the Nazis. The love triangle feels twee but Mayo manages to keep it in check and not let it bog this particular sub movie down. When the pic is out on the water it\u2019s grand entertainment, nicely filmed and featuring Oscar winning effects work. Momentum is gradually built until the finale comes and delivers an action packed bonanza. Hooray! 7/10"}], "recommandations_id": [51791, 171297, 241754, 94192]}
