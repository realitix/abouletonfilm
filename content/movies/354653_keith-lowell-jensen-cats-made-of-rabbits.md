Jensen is the renowned \"Atheist Comedian\" and he returns to his hometown and spews utterly sincere filth for over an hour. Watch it on Sunday morning. It's almost as funny as church but without the awful music and begging for money. Jensen gives you the best or at least the most obscenity laden yet still scientific arguments to use against creationists. This DVD also includes an interview with Keith Lowell Jensen, TV Spot for To The Moon and a Trailer for Why Lie? I Need a Drink.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Keith Lowell Jensen (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
