Inevitably, Bret and Margie quarrel and break up, only to be reunited by their efforts to snag \"banana king\" Gomez (Mischa Auer) for a lucrative radio contract. The old 1920s tune \"Margie\" is heard throughout the proceedings, frequently fitted out with ludicrous new lyrics (\"Bananas! We're Always Thikin' of Bananas!\" etc.) by a zany songwriting team (Eddie Quillan and Wally Vernon).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qAyWzHrwdlzo9XBiuIaaLPTbS5.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Brown (Bret)", "Nan Grey (Margie)", "Mischa Auer (Gomez)", "Joy Hodges (Ruth)", "Edgar Kennedy (Chauncey)", "Allen Jenkins (Kenneth)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
