As he did for his acclaimed feature Bloody Sunday, writer-director Paul Greengrass based the story on actual events and filmed it cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9-style. The cast is equal to the task in bringing the case to wrenching life. We're there in 1993 as racists viciously attack Stephen, an 18-year-old of Jamaican descent. We're there as his parents (Hugh Quarshie and Marianne Jean-Baptiste) grieve their loss. And we're there as they muster their resources, resolving to do whatever it takes to see his killers brought to justice. Although authorities attempted to bury the case, Stephen's murder became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre due to the two ordinary individuals who refused to rest until it was solved. Thanks to their efforts, crimes against minorities aren't likely to be treated so lightly ever again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qeOv1osLdCTYQel3rUU32EIEFi6.jpg", "actors": ["Marianne Jean-Baptiste (Doreen Lawrence)", "Hugh Quarshie (Neville Lawrence)", "Leon Black (Stephen Lawrence)", "Ashley Walters (Stuart Lawrence)", "Millicent Gezi (Georgina Lawrence)", "Joseph Kpobie (Duwayne Brooks)", "Brian Bovell (Uncle)", "Jo Martin (Cheryl Stoley)", "Michael Feast (DCS Ilsley)", "Kenneth Cranham (Michael Mansfield QC)", "David Calder (Sir Paul Condon)", "Shaun Chawdhary (Imran Khan)", "Stafford Gordon (DAC Ian Johnston)", "David Schaal (DS Bevan)", "Jenny Tarren (WDC Holden)", "Natasha Williams (Clara)", "Do\u00f1a Croll (Ros Howells OBE)", "Sandra Bee (ARA Woman)", "Trevor Thomas (ARA Man)", "Ricci Harnett (Neil Acourt)", "Lee Colley (Jamie Acourt)", "Darren Morfitt (Luke Knight)", "Neil Maskell (Gary Dobson)", "Dominic Power (David Norris)", "Simon Kunz (Defence Barrister)", "Tim Munro (Mr Taffe)", "Terry Bird (Mr Shepherd)", "Philip Nelson (Joey Shepherd)", "Cathy Murphy (Woman at Door)", "Howard Whitson (Council Official)", "Neelam Bakshi (Doctor)", "Polly Lister (Nurse)", "Paul Barrow (Staff Officer)", "Anna Northam (PC Bethal)", "Kim MacDonald (PC Gleeson)", "Jack Waters (Reporter)", "Andy Baker (Reporter)", "Tony Guilfoyle (Magistrate)", "David Cann (Forensic Scientist)", "Sam Cox (Pathologist)", "Albert Welling (Jury Foreman)", "David McKail (Coroner)", "Elaine Rhoades (Theresa Norris)", "Lawrence Sheldon (Noakes)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
