A boy named Willy finds out when the Sparrow Guardian turns him into a Sparrow for shooting a BB gun at the little birds. Suddenly, Willy's own cat thinks of him as lunch but, luckily, some new sparrow friends rush to Willy's rescue. They deliver him to a grandfatherly old bird named Cipur who takes Willy under his wing, teaches him how to fly, and so much more. In return, Willy fulfills Cipur's lifelong dream for knowledge by teaching him ow to read. Willy's new friendship helps him understand that all creatures have feelings and deserve to be treated with kindness and respect. Before Willy is turned back into a boy, he leads the sparrows in a brave but perilous plan to retake their home in the barn from Blacky the cat. Finally, the Sparrow Guardian offers Willy a very special opportunity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jzeGZ9tubQnMOJBTxiw9Eika5RX.jpg", "actors": ["Levente Igaz (Vili)", "Kl\u00e1ri Tolnay (Verb\u00e9na)", "J\u00f3zsef Sz\u00e9khelyi (Cip\u00far, old sparrow)", "Eszter K\u00e1r\u00e1sz (F\u00fcles)", "Eszterg\u00e1lyos Cec\u00edlia (Cili, the cat)", "M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Usztics (Spagyi)", "J\u00f3zsef Gyabronka (Csures)", "Szil\u00e1gyi Tibor (Krampusz, the black cat)", "Ildik\u00f3 H\u00fcv\u00f6sv\u00f6lgyi (Csiperke)", "Ildik\u00f3 Kilin (Csiri)", "Zolt\u00e1n Bor (Sunya)", "P\u00e9ter Tihanyi (Guri)", "Istv\u00e1n Hatfaludy (Z\u00fcfec)", "Zolt\u00e1n Benk\u00f3czy (Degesz, the fat rat)", "S\u00e1ndor Suka (Zsozs\u00f3, the drunk rat)", "Andr\u00e1s Koml\u00f3s (The porter)", "Antal Farkas (The bartender)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
