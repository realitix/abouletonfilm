Provocative, idiosyncratic and incendiary, the film weaves rarely seen archival material, contributor interviews, excerpts from writings by such icons as James Baldwin, Gore Vidal, and Joan Didion along with original verit\u00e9 footage filmed in the Review\u2019s West Village offices. Confrontation and original argument are in the Review's DNA - the magazine seems as vital now as when it was run by its indefatigable founding editors, Robert Silvers and the late Barbara Epstein. Co-produced with the BBC's award-winning Arena and shaped by Scorcese's vivid filmmaking style, The Fifty Year Argument captures the power of ideas in influencing history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4vgaBO4xsGTP6erS5ZTjHkzUBeW.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Chabon (Himself)", "Norman Mailer (Himself)", "Joan Didion (Herself)", "Barbara Epstein (Herself)", "Elizabeth Hardwick (Herself)", "Michael Stuhlbarg (Narration)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [155939, 33470, 91459, 44502], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
