This particular man tells him that \"people don't die, they get killed.\" For some reason, this strikes the lonely television repairman as profound. He has been building a ham radio at home out of spare parts so that he will have someone to talk to. Shortly after talking to the street person, his circle of friends is diminished by one when his friend Alex is reported to have killed himself. This in itself is a bit of a mystery, and Tim attempts to make sense of it by talking to a lawyer, Alex's girlfriend, and others.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6TOUwuVxxIBXQWvqPPO0nnHLXFC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
