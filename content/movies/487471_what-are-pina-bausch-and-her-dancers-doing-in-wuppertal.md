A socially engaged documentarian, Wildenhahn is also perplexed by this issue and spends considerable time trying to place Bausch in a context outside of the aesthetic. Still, the dance company's daily life and the excruciating rehearsal and performance schedule is solidly captured. The film begins cleverly: a dance critic offers sagacious comments on ballet dancers finishing their careers at mid-thirty just when, according to Bausch, the \"aspects of misery, suffering and fear of death should become an integral part of a dancer's spiritual and psychological make-up.\" Wildenhahn's camera glides over the dancers' bodies as Bausch leads them through their paces, a consummate teacher. Leaving behind rehearsals of \"Bandone\u00f3n\" and \"Walzer,\" Wildenhahn then ventures out into the streets of Wuppertal searching for the dance of the common people.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Pina Bausch (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
