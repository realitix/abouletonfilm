A story of courage and bravery. It is the life of Jos\u00e9 Fierro, a man who faces the consequences of his acts when he decides to go all out; of his wife Ana Luisa, who wants to experience love and eroticism beyond what is permitted. A brave movie that reflects the best and the worst of humans, but is also a tragicomedy (as is life), full of humor, hope and self-sacrifice: the reflection of a country undergoing a permanent financial crisis, produced by the Tequila effect, but which has the virtue of not letting itself be defeated.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4lMtIIMAaO9LSi50Sm70cxZu78I.jpg", "actors": ["Eduardo Victoria (Jose Fierro)", "Karla Souza (Ana Luisa)", "Mauricio Bonet (Roviroza)", "Tony Cabral (Parroquiano)", "Julio Casado (Angel)", "V\u00edctor Civeira (Garces)", "Ana Fernanda Ju\u00e1rez (Anita)", "Valeria Maldonado (Cecilia)", "Itari Marta (Fernanada)", "Juli\u00e1n Pastor (Raymundo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
