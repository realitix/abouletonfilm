Now, with a onehour special airing on Comedy Central, she makes her major-label debut with that same outrageous, in-your-face performance on CD and DVD with Take It Like A Man, recorded live at The Improv in Hollywood, FL. Shocking and hilarious, no-holds-barred and politically incorrect, Lampanelli is Don Rickles with breasts and major PMS.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s1Agr47kv1XKGCsJgkPgY8124yk.jpg", "actors": ["Lisa Lampanelli (herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
