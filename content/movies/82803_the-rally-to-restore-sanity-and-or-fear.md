Seriously, who?  Because we\u2019re looking for those people.  We\u2019re looking for the people who think shouting is annoying, counterproductive, and terrible for your throat; who feel that the loudest voices shouldn\u2019t be the only ones that get heard; and who believe that the only time it\u2019s appropriate to draw a Hitler mustache on someone is when that person is actually Hitler. Or Charlie Chaplin in certain roles.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e0V4GoLsg3fehY0fx0GQyST4YOD.jpg", "actors": ["Jon Stewart (Himself - Co-Host)", "Stephen Colbert (Himself - Co-Host)", "John Oliver (Himself - Correspondent)", "Aasif Mandvi (Himself - Correspondent)", "Wyatt Cenac (Himself - Correspondent)", "Jason Jones (Himself (Correspondent))", "Olivia Munn (Himself - Correspondent)", "Tim Meadows (P.
