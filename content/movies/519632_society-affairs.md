Society Affairs is an affair to remember. Great acting and superb filmmaking by director, Gary Garver and starring the infamous Harry Reems. Considered to be one of Garver's best comedies of the 80s, a smart and well constructed film satire of high society. Blistering sex abound in this killer return for Reems, which also features Veronica Hart in a pair of mind-blowing fornication scenes!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bT3Mv4Eurhs5oFBLDPMmudk9zc6.jpg", "actors": ["Harry Reems (Rick / Howard Austin II)", "Veronica Hart (Alexis Cavanaugh)", "Kelly Nichols (Lillian Bushnell)", "Anna Ventura (Bridesmaid - Lighter Hair)", "Tiffany Clark (Dorina Austin)", "Robert Kerman (Arthur)", "Tara Aire (Tara the Head Maid)", "Jack Newton ()", "Laurie Smith (Bridesmaid - Darker Hair)", "Honey Wilder (Coreena Bushnell)", "John Alderman (H.K.
