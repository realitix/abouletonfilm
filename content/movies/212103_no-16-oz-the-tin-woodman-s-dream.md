He goes to the edge of a cliff, where he meats an Asian spirit who gives him a heart shape that becomes a kite that hooks to him with a cane. This is followed by approximately ten minutes of kaleidoscopic images, including a man's hands, a dancing girl, and a cutout of Krishna. - IMDb", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cG2GWktjB7FSd62hUFIqtyl8Myc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
