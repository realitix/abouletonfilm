With his buddies Kim (Irene Joseph), Dave (Rob Monkiewicz), and Heather (Diane Di Gregorio), Shep tracks down the machine despite warings of Winthrop's great-granddaughter, a wiccan named Amelia (Liz Hurley). Shep restores the machine and while video taping it in action, a horrible accident transforms him into the ultimate tapehead (while unleashing killer bugs from another dimension and a few walking corpses along the way). Shep kidnaps Heather to turn her into his monster bride and only the intervention of the mysterious Amelia can halt the madness", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3Q2ZrSaBO5uc4jJ7X3mBLjkwRuP.jpg", "actors": ["Dan Merriman (Shep Franco)", "Rob Monkiewicz (Dave)", "Diane DiGregorio (Heather)", "Elizabeth Hurley (Winthrop's Granddaughter)", "Irene Joseph (Kim)", "Katie Jordan (Ellen)", "Philip Barbour (Artemis Winthrop)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
