That is, right up until she disappears from the back seat without a trace. When confusion gives way to reality, he resets his meter and is instantaneously transported back to the moment when she climbed into his cab. As he and Penny find themselves trapped in an endless nighttime cab ride, with only each other for company, secrets will be revealed, truths will come to light, and Harris' entire life will be changed forever.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rL3Myhbck4jfhC9GF7iGvX9CtCX.jpg", "actors": ["Gino Anthony Pesi (Harris)", "Brinna Kelly (Penny)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "QvhS5BuBfHQ"}
