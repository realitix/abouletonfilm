The Patient in Room 18. Patric Knowles delivers a delightfully comic performance as Lance, an outwardly normal young man obsessed with detective stories. When his obsession threatens to lapse over into lunacy, Lance is sent to the hospital for a nice long rest. It isn't long before he gets mixed up in a genuine murder mystery, using his second-hand knowhow to solve the case. Up-and-coming Ann Sheridan is quite amusing as Lance's nurse and confidante, while the murderer is played by a fellow who is usually cast as the murder victim.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5AVfbhlgKl2VSKg2Ct8CEE6PQ3t.jpg", "actors": ["Patric Knowles (Lance O'Leary)", "Ann Sheridan (Sara Keate)", "Eric Stanley (Bentley)", "John Ridgely (Jim Warren)", "Rosella Towne (Maida Day)", "Jeanne Benedict (Carol Lethany)", "Charles Trowbridge (Dr. Bahman)", "Cliff Clark (Inspector Foley)", "Harland Tucker (Dr. Arthur Lethany)", "Edward Raquello (Dr. Fred Harker)", "Vickie Lester (Nurse Taylor)", "Edward McWade (Frank Warren)", "Ralph Sanford (Detective Donahue)", "Frank Orth (Joe Higgins - Night Watchman)", "Greta Meyer (Hilda - Lethany Housekeeper)", "Walter Young (Coroner)", "Glen Cavender (Man with Sprinkler Hose)", "Loia Cheaney (Jean the Night Nurse)", "Mary Doyle (Nurse)", "Ralph Dunn (Eldar Hotel Clerk)", "John Harron (Thatcher Hospital Orderly)", "George Hickman (Newsboy #2)", "Stuart Holmes (Man Leaving Hospital)", "Carole Landis (Patient in Hospital)", "Jack Mower (Policeman Picking Up Radium at End)", "George Offerman, Jr. (Newsboy #1 / Newsboy in Montage)", "John J.
