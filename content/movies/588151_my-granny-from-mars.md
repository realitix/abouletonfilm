Separated from her family, she lives in a forgotten seaside town while trying to decide whether to stay or to leave. The sounds of Ukrainian pop music and folk songs add to the atmosphere of her exile town, which is seen through a sensitive lens filled with sentimentality. But the consequences of the unsatisfactory political situation are ever-present in this place, which is like a different planet. The way in which the director records Zina\u2019s relationship to her friends and family betrays a deep respect for this old woman, her life wisdom, and her experiences. \"After the annexation of Crimea my old Ukranian granny Zina had to face the fact of living on a 'new planet'. For many reasons, the time has come for her to make a crucial decision.\" A.
