Their ambitious Bridge Over Troubled Water album had yet to be released and the glorious title song was heard here by the general public for the very first time. The program showed news clips of labor leader/activist Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers, the Poor People\u2019s Campaign\u2019s march on Washington, the assassinations of Martin Luther King, JFK and Robert Kennedy and other events that were emblematic of the era.  \u201cSongs of America\u201d was originally sponsored by the Bell Telephone Company, but the execs there got cold feet when they saw what they\u2019d paid for\u2014legend has it that they looked at the footage of JFK, RFK and MLK during the (powerful!) \u201cBridge Over Troubled Water\u201d segment (approx 12 minutes in) and asked for more Republicans! (Not assassinated Republicans, just more Republicans...you know, for balance!) The special was eventually picked up by CBS.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c1OjzFcWCw7FkuCvevFX4Pen0eH.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Simon (Himself)", "Art Garfunkel (Himself)", "Charles Grodin (Himself)", "Roy Halee (Himself)", "Robert Ryan (Himself - Host)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
