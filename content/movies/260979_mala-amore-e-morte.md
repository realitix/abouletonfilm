Her clothes fall off in almost every scene as with the help of a young handsome man she seeks a resolution to the mystery surrounding the murder, and the meaning of a block of wood with cryptical markings. Femi runs afoul of a bunch of idiotic gangsters, including a mob boss whose trademark is a red rose which he carries with him at all times. Some other girl is taking her clothes off a lot as well. Eventually they wind up in a weird sex club and then a graveyard.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lJouzuErtqzgRRjRVTCTYBP1O4D.jpg", "actors": ["Femi Benussi (Marisa Belli)", "Gianni Macchia (Marco Ranalli / Carlo Martini)", "Massimo Mollica (Barone Francesco De Carolis - Mob Boss)", "Gabriella Lepori (Sissy)", "Fran\u00e7oise Pr\u00e9vost (Adalgisa Belli)", "Renato Pinciroli (Cemetery Guard)", "Gigi Ballista (Carlo Alberto Giorgi)", "Ennio Biasciucci ()", "Franca Scagnetti (Cleaning Lady)", "Danika La Loggia (Nightclub Hostess)", "Franca Scagnetti ()", "Tony Askin (Hotel Guest)", "Giulio Baraghini (Mimi - Bodyguard)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
