Broderick Crawford plays a despotic 10th century Spanish king who, in cahoots with the invading Moors, has banished handsome Castilian nobleman Spartaco Santoni. With the surreptitious aid of Crawford's daughter Teresa Velasquez, Santoni assembles an army to march against the Moors. In keeping with the 13th century epic poem from which this film was derived (\"El Poema de Fernan Gonzales\") Santoni's path is smoothed by the celestial intervention of patron saints Milan and Santiago. Among the big names picking up a few tax-free dollars in The Castilian are Cesar Romero, Linda Darnell, Alida Valli and Fernando Rey.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oT4Bd4bNLLFNB4qSC57Ywd3iTWt.jpg", "actors": ["Espartaco Santoni (Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez)", "Frankie Avalon (Jerif\u00e1n)", "Cesar Romero (Jer\u00f3nimo)", "Tere Vel\u00e1zquez (Sancha)", "Tom\u00e1s Blanco (Don Nu\u00f1o)", "Germ\u00e1n Cobos (Abderram\u00e1n)", "Alida Valli (Reina Teresa)", "Fernando Rey (Ramiro II, rey de Le\u00f3n)", "Broderick Crawford (Don Sancho)", "Julio Pe\u00f1a (Santiago)", "Soledad Miranda (Maria Est\u00e9vez)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
