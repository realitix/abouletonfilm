On the lam from the police, Antonio (Crox Alvaredo) and Jose Luis (Armando Sylvestre) find refuge in a friendly seaside village. The two fugitives set up housekeeping with their mutual girlfriend Rossana (Rossana Podesta). This set-up can't possibly last, and it doesn't. When Rossana indicates that she prefers one of the men over the other, it's the beginning of the end for all three. Well-photographed on location, La Red was one of Mexico's entries at the 1953 Cannes Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kUNVrT6PWeJvuQaVXpDmoI8LaLK.jpg", "actors": ["Rossana Podest\u00e0 (Rossana)", "Crox Alvarado (Antonio)", "Armando Silvestre (Jos\u00e9 Luis)", "Guillermo Cramer (Rivera)", "Carlos Riquelme (Sponge Trader)", "Margarito Luna (Fisherman)", "Antonio Bribiesca (Guitar player)", "Emilio Garibay (Policeman)", "Manuel Vergara 'Manver' (Bartender)", "Armando Velasco ()", "Lilia Fresno ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
