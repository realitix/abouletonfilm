Ghastlee Ghoul\"), Leanna Chamish (\"Boo dePest\"), and narrated by New England horror host \"Penny Dreadful,\" Bald Headed Blues is un-apologetically self-indulegent as it picks up where the documentary Every Other Day is Halloween left off, telling the story of how one person inadvertently changed the face of horror hosting forever.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/daoXZfi3w8u4dO1YdLkZDsMRIbR.jpg", "actors": ["John Dimes (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
