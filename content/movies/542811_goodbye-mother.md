This is a problem of society\u2019s responsibility to its future. The war ended long ago, but the children\u2019s homes were overflowing in the 1960s. When I found out about this, I was simply dumbfounded. I did not want to read the viewers a lecture, but hoped to affect them on an emotional level. This is one of my most beloved pictures. This is a motto of kindness, mercy, a message from man to the individual, this is the problem of a person\u2019s responsibility to the future\u201d (director Mikhail Litvyakov).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6ApqH0qk5xAYBTft8fPVkuw9Lqn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
