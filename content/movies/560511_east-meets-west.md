Having invited Donal Lunny and his band to play at the 1996 and 1997 Earth Celebrations on Sado Island, The Kodo Drummers made their first trip to Dublin, Ireland, in July 1998 to perform a series of concerts with the Donal Lunny Band. From barely audible pianissimos to earth-shattering explosions of sound, Kodo masterfully combine pr imal energy with virtuoso refinement.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c5S2zQPihSYlCbzE8y9i0sI7QuQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
