At nightfall, people seem to regain a vitality which explodes in the bars to the rhythm of the latest hits from the music charts. The first part tells the story of Petit-Jean, a young graduate, who is unemployed and roams the city in search of work. From humiliations to frustrations, the destiny of this young ordinary African changes dramatically. The second part follows a young girl who transforms herself into an angel of death in order to free herself from a traumatic past. The final section is of an encounter between a woman and a man who seem ordinary at first, but a past which the woman had thought had forever disappeared, resurfaces in this man.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jean Bediebe ()", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Beleck ()", "J\u00e9rome Bolo ()", "Deneuve Djobong ()", "Thilombo Lubambu ()", "Therese Ngo Ngambi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
