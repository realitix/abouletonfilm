The original title, Tannhauser und der Sangerkrieg auf Wartburg, reveals the real nature of the opera, born by a fusion of two traditional sagas and dedicated to the dualism of spirituality and sensuality and the possibility of redemption through love. Composed between 1843 and 1845, Tannhauser has a tormented musical theme, made up of constant variations. It debuted in Dresden in 1845 when Wagner was just over 30.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/er1cMOzosP8EBkRMMLZ6HVcwVS.jpg", "actors": ["Alan Woodrow (Tannh\u00e4user)", "Ludwig Baumann (Wolfram)", "Gertrud Ottenthal (Elisabeth)", "Andrea Silvestrelli (Hermann)", "Nikolov Bojidar (Walter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
