But spends so much of its runtime (which was already too short to be involved enough as is) alongside the perpetrators of the crime, and yet somehow offers absolutely zero insight into their motivations or even something as simple as what they spent their ill-gotten money on. _Tell Them Lucifer Was Here_ is content to simply tell its audience \"Look at these people, they have bad teeth and say mean things, aren't they despicable?\", but I am not content. If you can't give us the \"**Why** are they despicable\" then you could have at least played the thing out as mystery, in stead we are given insider-knowledge of the villains from the get-go, and it is used to absolutely no effect.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
