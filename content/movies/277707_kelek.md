Unlike most examples of this genre, though, KELEK is never boring and is brought to a new awareness of the process of perception. The five basic shots of the film have to be filled by the viewer's own consciousness and there is absolutely no opportunity given for any spurious identification.\" Werner Nekes", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yKWNfJ2AWPRgQ9sXeOASCILYhPz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
