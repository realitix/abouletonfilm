Expert Drum tutor Pete Riley demonstrates some unusual phrasing and timing situations, and suggests a series of techniques as strategies, including:\r Double pedal phrasing\r Open-handed high-hats\r Inverted double-strokes\r Moeller single-strokes  This tutorial is ideal for all drummers that feel constrained by standard 'lick'-based drumming patterns, and wish to expand their vocabulary across the barlines and trough different rhythm subdivisions. It is also ideal for more elementary drummers that wish to approach their instrument in a more complex manner as early as possible.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z3oYrm6bpQFoiKIG9pFloDyt5nP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
