Along the way however, there is some fun to be had as more humorous incidents occur on the sound stage, together with dashes of nudity. Some of the events are presumably inspired by real life experiences, others have a distinct air of wishful fabrication. The over-the-top Kung Fu star, deserted by director and crew as he goes through his pointless extended routine, for instance. Or the action heroes, sweating in furs while they dutifully munch through their meal scene, 'snow' falling outside in studio land.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3ZG85B4qycsi4HaE3jL3UpUWMr7.jpg", "actors": ["Tony Liu (Xu Xiang)", "Tai Liang-Chun (Ms Dai)", "Choh Seung-Wan (Queen of Temple Street)", "Ku Feng (Movie director)", "Lee Din-Hing (Mary)", "Helen Poon Bing-Seung (Actress of White Snake)", "Shaw Yin Yin (Shao Yin Yin)", "Chan Shen (Fa Hai)", "Cheng Miu (Dr Zhao)", "Wang Lai (Md She)", "Chiang Nan (Movie director Yang)", "Shum Lo (Movie producer)", "Lau Siu-Kwan (Ms Dai's fiance)", "Eric Chan Ga-Kei ()", "Tsang Choh-Lam (Lao Si)", "Fung Ging-Man (Producer Fong)", "Wang Han-Chen (Doctor)", "Ng Hong-Sang (Hairy Can)", "Chun Wong (Movie director in erotic scene)", "Li Han-Hsiang (Himself in opening scene)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
