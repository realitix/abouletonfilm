Described by the director as an 'anxious allegory and chilling album of nostalgia,' its penetrating monomania is unexpectedly \u2014 subversively \u2014 realized to be a statement about American today: the alienation and atomization o technological consumer society is reflected in the very style of the film.\" - Amos Vogel, Film as a Subversive Art", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lwPb52IGt2wkCNMp9coiVOdcDBc.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Ohlrich ()", "Pat Myers ()", "Jake Leed ()", "Mary Leed ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [162495, 211209, 355505, 198569], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
