As the title suggests, it takes its basic narrative from the myth of Orpheus, and his courageous but ill-fated attempt to rescue his lover Eurydice (also known as Eurydike) from the jaws of the underworld. This particular production finds Yann Bridard dancing as Orpheus and Marie-Agn\u00e8s Gillot dancing as Eurydike , with mezzo-soprano Maria-Riccarda Wesseling accompanying Bridard and soprano Julia Kleiter accompanying Wesseling. Pina Bausch did the choreography and stage direction, while Rolf Borzik designed the sets, costumes and lighting. The Balthasar-Neumann Ensemble & Choir, under the direction of Thomas Hengelbrock, lend musical accompaniment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ln2BX1KkbpGTHj2iSJ5GUkQxuVa.jpg", "actors": ["Thomas Hengelbrock (Conductor)", "Yann Bridard ()", "Maria Riccarda Wesseling ()", "Marie-Agn\u00e8s Gillot ()", "Julia Kleiter ()", "Miteki Kudo ()", "Sunhae Im ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
