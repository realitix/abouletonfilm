INXS are in top form playing a set that draws tracks from across their career and includes many of their greatest hits and best loved tracks. As a bonus there are also six tracks from the first INXS performance for Rockpalast at the Markethalle Hamburg on May 8th 1984, which offers a rare glimpse of the band in their earlier days as they were just starting to break through in Europe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t1HIDmsWKJaueCVql3pESMHSxwo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
