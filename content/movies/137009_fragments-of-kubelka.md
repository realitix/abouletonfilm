While Kubelka\u2019s radical and pioneering body of films is a highly condensed work of about an hour, focusing on the essence of cinema, his legendary lectures often unfold over many hours. These lectures on \u201cwhat is cinema\u201d and \u201ccooking as an art form\u201d are frequently illuminated by presentation of archaeological artefacts from Kubelka\u2019s eclectic collection. He considers his ongoing collecting to be an expanded film practice which explores the evolution of humanity.\u2028 Martina Kudl\u00e1\u010dek has carefully woven an open-ended portrait which goes beyond the biographical to reveal fresh insights into the phenomenon of film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ugBSLfVu8pXkbQy5MH1edQpJ4u3.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Kubelka (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
