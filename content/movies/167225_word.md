How can a bunch of individuals be a team you ask? Their creativity is the bond that connects them, driving the voice of our brand and beating the drum of new ways to look at the mountain, the streets, backcountry and everywhere in between. We're proud of these riders who every day bring something new to all aspects of skiing. Where there's snow and enough room to slide on it, you'll find Line MCs.
