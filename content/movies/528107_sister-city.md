Each shift begets a kind of origin story: one encounter traces the specific azure of a James Turrell installation to a pet shop jellyfish, in another, a modern-day putto purifies a horrific tale by blowing bubbles in a tub. Sister City, like water, seeks its own level; cresting and displacing continuous bursts of life spiritualized, succulent, and ultimately alone.  -Deirtra Thompson", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jqfyCQTjv7ATWgCXu3K3LEN0UIG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
