Filmed in Jerusalem and surrounding areas, this is a unique take on many of the songs from United\u2019s most recent release, Empires.  With breathtaking imagery and impacting visuals and audio, this live project is one of the most unique to come out of Hillsong.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5r1BSoNEWJUlOutmhPrLml8esNk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
