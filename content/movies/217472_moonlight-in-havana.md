It turns out that Johnny has a beautiful singing voice, but only when he's suffering from a cold. Enterprising nightclub manager Barney Crane (William Frawley) attempts to inflict poor Johnny with cold germs, resulting in unchecked zaniness whenever our hero recovers sufficiently to lose his voice. The film's 63-minute running time manages to accommodate the drunken comedy relief of Hugh O'Connell and Jack Norton, and an abundance of musical numbers, courtesy of Allan Jones, Jane Frazee, the Horton Dancing Group, the Jivin' Jacks and Jills and Grace &amp; Nicco.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3Fk9POpqzOXaju9mOjkPpGowCrg.jpg", "actors": ["Allan Jones (Johnny Norton)", "Jane Frazee (Gloria Jackson)", "Marjorie Lord (Patsy Clark)", "William Frawley (Barney Crane)", "Don Terry (Eddie Daniels)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
