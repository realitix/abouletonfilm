To get his in-laws out of the house, Harold has regularly left a bottle of booze for Claude to be able to entertain prospective employers. When Harold learns that on all the other occasions the employers have not showed (he assumes there probably were no prospective employers) leaving Claude to consume the booze on his own, he decides to show Claude a lesson by spiking the bottle with castor oil. Complications ensue when Joe, Harold's friend, encourages him to skip work to attend the prize fight. What Joe doesn't tell Harold is that he tells his boss that Harold needs the day off to attend to the sudden death of his brother-in-law.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Lloyd Hamilton (Harold Hobbs)", "Marjorie Beebe (Hortense Hobbs)", "Tom Dugan (Claude - Harold's Brother-in-Law)", "Aggie Herring (Harold's Mother-in-Law)", "Bud Jamison (Arresting Policeman)", "Tom Dempsey (1st Traffic Cop)", "Ernie Alexander (Hot Dog Vendor)", "Joe Bordeaux (Fight Reporter)", "Harry Bowen (2nd Traffic Cop)", "Lige Conley (Ambulance Attendant)", "Bobby Dunn (Ticket Seller)", "George Gray (Police Clerk)", "William McCall (Cop in Station)", "Roger Moore (Two Tens for a Five Gag)", "Dave Morris (Civilian in Station)", "Hugh Saxon (Police Doctor)", "Dick Stewart (Fight Announcer)", "Ted Stroback (Chauffeur)", "Arthur Thalasso (Detective)", "Fred Warren (Joe - Harold's Pal)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
