Recorded live at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles on June 11 during their 2005 World tour, in which they played New Zealand for the first time and returned to Australia, this rare live recording is pure Moody Blues. With the Moodies' unique brand of music that has kept them at the top of their profession for 40 years, and has maintained them as one of the biggest live touring acts of all-time, this is a truly sparkling performance from one of the world's greatest and best-loved rock bands.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8z3x2TWrSSSv1nChxlDbDPlhBpN.jpg", "actors": ["Justin Hayward (Vocals, Guitar)", "John Lodge (Bass, Vocals)", "Graeme Edge (Drums, Vocals)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
