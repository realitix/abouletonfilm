Understanding that the shooting could set off a chain reaction of copycat violence across the country, Gannon quarantines his fellow militiamen in the remote lumber mill they call their headquarters. There, he sets about a series of grueling interrogations, intent on ferreting out the killer and turning him over to the authorities to prevent further bloodshed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uCyDJGQ54vcCclNqa6nLcSqH3DQ.jpg", "actors": ["James Badge Dale (Gannon)", "Brian Geraghty (Noah)", "Patrick Fischler (Beckmann)", "Chris Mulkey (Ford)", "Happy Anderson (Morris)", "Cotter Smith (Roman)", "Robert Aramayo (Keating)", "Gene Jones (Hubbel)", "Bret Porter (Kowalski)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [464742, 493488, 501154, 454312], "youtube_key": "Cu8cfNMu99Y"}
