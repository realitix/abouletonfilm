Apparently, this guy will take on any bet or act on a whim. This becomes very apparent when he disrupts a food giveaway hosted by the mayor's daughter and as a result of this, he announces he's running for mayor--though he seems very much apolitical and has no interest in the job. Later, when he once again meets up with the mayor's daughter (Joan Fontaine) they supposedly fall in love--although there seemed to be little chemistry between them and it made very little sense for Fontaine to suddenly love a guy she so quickly hated at the beginning of the film. Plus, she really had plenty of reason to dislike the guy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gDQDI9rQPJZTdVpV3YvIQpnfgVo.jpg", "actors": ["Preston Foster (James Ellsworth 'Jimmy' Hughes)", "Joan Fontaine (Trudy Olson)", "Herbert Mundin (Jasper 'Meadows' Hives)", "William Brisbane (Clem Bruner)", "Alan Bruce (Scoop Gallagher)", "Paul Hurst (Foreman Butch Mehaffey)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
