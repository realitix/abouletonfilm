White money still controls the government. One official, Aboucader Beye, known by the title \"El Hadji,\" takes advantage of some of that money to marry his third wife, to the sorrow and chagrin of his first two wives and the resentment of his nationalist daughter. But he discovers on his wedding night that he has been struck with a \"xala,\" a curse of impotence. El Hadji goes to comic lengths to find the cause and remove the xala, resulting in a scathing satirical ending.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jenxPA7EPk7i1W0paW72sEtZDvA.jpg", "actors": ["Thierno Leye (Hadji Aboucader Beye)", "Myriam Niang (Rama (as Miriam Niang))", "Seune Samb (Adja Assatu, Beye's wife)", "Fatim Diagne (Saleslady / Secretary)", "Younouss Seye (Aram, Second Wife)", "Mustapha Ture (The Client)", "Iliamane Sagna (Modu, El Hadji's chauffeur)", "Dieynaba Niang (La Badiene)", "Makhouredia Gueye (Minister Kebe)", "Farba Sarr (Business Man)", "Mamadou Sarr (Business Man)", "Farba Sarr (Businessman)", "Mamadou Sarr (Businessman)", "Abdoulaye Seck (Businessman)", "Douta Seck (Gorgui)", "Youssou N'Dour (Star Band de Dakar)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [145033, 152304, 302570, 162512], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
