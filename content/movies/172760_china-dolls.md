They scuffle and Tong shoots Chiu dead with Chiu's gun. They flee but Tong is killed in a shootout with police. May begs an officer to take her child, since if he is repatriated he'll have a horrible life. So, the infant son ends up in Hong Kong separated from his mother. Six years pass and May is a hotel maid then gets forced into prostitution. She longs to see her son, who is now a young boy, maybe to fully reunite with him. The problem with this film is it becomes so sleazy. There is nudity (not Ms. Yip), violence and forcible rape.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/orty0pxA1L0u3WNt6LNi1siZAzd.jpg", "actors": ["Amy Yip (May)", "Wu Ma (Lao)", "Lee Yuet-Sin (Chau)", "Suen Kwok-Ming (Tong)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
