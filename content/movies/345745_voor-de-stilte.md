Seven people share their personal story, hopes, believes and religious thoughts. Every person deals with their fears and vision on the approaching death. Through their eyes we learn to think in a different way about hospices and experience how to make the last moments count. During these last months, it appears that life has more to offer to them, than they expected.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nUQbWp4vcjPxEmyRNPGpblO4x6o.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
