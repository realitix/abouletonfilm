The film consists of German and Soviet archive footage of the World War II \u2014 to be exact, from the end of the war. An attempt to make a large\u2013scale documentary on this subject had been undertaken in the Soviet cinema of the 1960s: the film \u2014 \u201cOrdinary Fascism\u201d \u2014 by the outstanding Soviet film\u2013maker Mikhail Romm had become a classic retrospective investigation of fascism. But Sokurov uses the expressive power of the documentary image in an absolutely different way. He does not amass materials for a large\u2013scale picture of Nazi crimes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hnPBnW921cANaHiX8UW7muD5PVq.jpg", "actors": ["Adolf Hitler ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [46994, 154653, 387646, 132136], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
