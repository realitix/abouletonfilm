Annoyed that hubby would rather make war than Ding-Dong, Listra organizes the women of both tribes to go on strike and \"abstain Ding-Dong\" until the men stop fighting. It all happens back in the days when men carried clubs and women played ding-dong, an Italian stone-age sex comedy based on the Greek classic \"Lysistrata\" and filled with shapely cavewomen sporting '70s hairstyles, a gay caveman with the hots for the hero, a title tune that will follow you forever and, of course, plenty of old-fashioned Ding-Dong!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jXMABvnykXZFwghRPKJ8cW6nOC2.jpg", "actors": ["Antonio Sab\u00e0to (Ari)", "Aldo Giuffr\u00e8 (Gott)", "Vittorio Caprioli (Gran Profe)", "Nadia Cassini (Listra)", "Renato Rossini (Mash)", "Elio Pandolfi (Lonno)", "Pia Giancaro (Bea)", "Gisela Hahn (Sissi)", "Lucretia Love (Lella)", "Patrizia Adiutori ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [131492, 41612, 53623, 18932], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
