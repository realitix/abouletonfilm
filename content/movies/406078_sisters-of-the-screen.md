With power and nuance, Ellerson also confronts the thorny question of cultural authenticity by revisiting the legendary 1991 FESPACO (Pan-African Festival of Cinema and Television of Ouagadougou), in which diasporian women were asked to leave a meeting intended for African woman only. This film is both a valuable anthology and a fitting homage to the pioneers and new talents of African cinema.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Safi Faye (Herself)", "Sarah Maldoror (Herself)", "Mbissine Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Diop (Herself)", "Ngozi Onwurah (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
