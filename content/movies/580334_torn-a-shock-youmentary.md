A small entourage including a documentary crew tag along on their nightly hunting trips but an escalating body count and rising tensions amongst the group look certain to destroy the fellowship even before they can locate the beast referred to by local legend as 'The Devonshire Devil'. \"TORN: a SHOCK YOUmentary\" is the product of the documentary film crew's findings. It is the tragic and terrifying story of how the lives of James and Oliver are torn apart by 'The Devonshire Devil'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kNtyAArhyJpOhLQ21cxtDOAtYEG.jpg", "actors": ["Phillip Alexander Baker (PC Meeker (as Phil Baker))", "Charlotte Bird (Charlotte Purdue)", "Simon Burbage (Richard Chittenden)", "Sam Burns (Dane Douglas)", "Prudence Catley (Sarah Dearsley)", "Martin Challinor (Rip Tappart)", "James Cotter (John Brushfield)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
