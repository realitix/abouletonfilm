The parties are, as one of them puts it, \u201cThe last place of expression for us. Truly free.\u201d  Their playful search for adventure takes them to forbidden places, the only spots left to explore in a city where every centimeter is in use. It might be a location in Versailles, an abandoned train next to a monument, a deserted military fort, or perhaps a cave. The decision is made only after an expedition with a backpack and a flashlight to explore the site and its approach routes thoroughly. Partygoers learn of the location just before the party starts, and there are strict rules for them to follow.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
