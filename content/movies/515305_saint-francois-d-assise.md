Pierre Audi's thoroughly engaging production for The Netherlands Opera brings out the naive imagery, the grandeur, and above all the vast tenderness of the resplendent score, revealed as a grandiose ritual with the meaning and purpose of life as its central theme. But the real drama of the work takes place in the orchestra. Elevated to stupendous heights by the sublimely inspired Ingo Metzmacher, The Hague Philharmonic and the Chorus of De Nederlandse Opera combine forces with a brilliant cast to produce the finest possible musical pilgrimage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mdwQyxsCQ0QEGihhzUxBFQhDRJ9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
