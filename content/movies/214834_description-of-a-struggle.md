In Description d\u2019un Combat, Marker\u2019s idiosyncratic style, combining location footage with archival material, builds a complex and personal portrayal. Israel\u2019s demography is explored, from the kibbutzim to the Arab minorities, the orthodox Jews, and the tourists. The \u201cbattle\u201d of the title does not refer to the tank-and-artillery variety, but to the inner struggle of Israeli citizens to adapt to a new view of themselves, in a new country.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hJVXT3bAXIQUsNM2T3qxh82SXjy.jpg", "actors": ["Alan Adair (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
