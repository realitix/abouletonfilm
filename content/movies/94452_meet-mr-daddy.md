Jong Dae is a lowlife conman and gangster who lives in a old trailer in a junkyard by the sea. Not exactly ideal father material. He is (understandably) shocked when, while in jail yet again, a social worker visits to inform him that he has a seven year old daughter called Joon (Seo Shin Ae) who has been living in an orphanage and is on her way to America to be adopted. Little Joon desperately wants to meet her daddy before she leaves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4838v464VRKx8qyTQtnohetsvlM.jpg", "actors": ["Ryu Seung-su (Ma Dong-soo)", "Park Shin-yang (Woo Jong-dae)", "Seo Shin-ae (Woo Joon)", "Ye Ji-won (Ha Sun-young)", "Kim Seon-hwa (Head Nun)", "Lee Kyung-young (Sang-joon)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [25937, 49556, 81760], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
