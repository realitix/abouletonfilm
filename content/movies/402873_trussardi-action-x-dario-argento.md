On some scene you can spot muscle-man Bruno Bilotta, who was on \"Demons 2\". No dialogue, only music. Features themes by Kate Bush. Re-enacted opening from Suspiria (1977) on national TV. Paid homage to Bava's Blood and Black Lace by directing a fashion show for designer Nicola Trussardi.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3xLnLYBLF36hfIlyLromgk0W6mb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
