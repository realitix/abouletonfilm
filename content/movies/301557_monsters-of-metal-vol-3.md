If these video clips can not be found on TV, then the congenial DVD-series brings it to your screen. Nothing that can not be shown, every metal genre essential release, and no act too small. That is what I call a perfect co-existence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nF4WCfz2zszmilDlpAUyHWc48l0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
