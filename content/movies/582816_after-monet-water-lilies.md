There have been a number of versions of the material I shot in about 1984 of water lilies and reeds in a pond. This sketch is the latest version and is part of work on a larger project \u2018Treatise\u2019 still in process. The sound was made by AMM for an earlier video work but has been re-mixed for this version.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hLZ0piDhcE1S3tqCtboGF4Olrjt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
