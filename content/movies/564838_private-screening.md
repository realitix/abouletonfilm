Among the complications is his growing regard for the woman who plays his cinematic wife. She may wind up replacing his actual wife in real life. One of the highlights of this film is the insight it gives into the actual mechanics of filmmaking.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qtYuhccRALIoer3EiZFyrLjcZn.jpg", "actors": ["Fran\u00e7oise Fabian ()", "Jean-Luc Bideau ()", "Jane Birkin ()", "Bulle Ogier ()", "Jacques Weber ()", "Barbara Laage ()", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gobbi ()", "Sabine Glaser ()", "Fran\u00e7oise Saint-Laurent ()", "Yan Brian ()", "Elisabeth Huppert ()", "Albert Simono ()", "Fran\u00e7ois Dyrek ()", "Jean-Louis Fortuit ()", "Pierre Bonasse ()", "Jonathan Hunther ()", "Albert Michel ()", "Jo\u00ebl Felzines ()", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kaminsky ()", "Raymond Huguen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
