He has his other loves - photography and model planes - to challenge him anyway. However, one day a car breaks down in front of his house, and a young mother with her 10-year-old daughter come in looking for assistance. The daughter is endearing and would make a terrific subject for a photo contest. As both the young mother and the computer operator studiously ignore the flicker of romantic sparks, it is only a matter of time before the flame either grows or is extinguished.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mLVu21Gl4Mw8NpQQV6w3CE9z367.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Bohringer (Julien)", "Catherine Frot (Charlotte)", "Anne Clignet (Juliette)", "Yvette Merlin (M\u00e8re de Julien)", "Isabelle Glorie ()", "Michel Galabru (Bideau)", "Michel Bawedin (Le Concierge)", "Liliane Becker (Mamy)", "Harry Cleven (Jean-Claude)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
