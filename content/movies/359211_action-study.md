Action: Study depicts Kerr\u2019s daughter playing on the shores of Georgian Bay, but could easily be mistaken as a work of abstract animation. Kerr combines innovative hand-held techniques with the ultra-sensitivity of the film stock to create a startling wash of jagged, erratic, and constantly dynamic compositions of black and white. Indeed, at times reality seems to melt in front of us.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fX3TUVfZEj8KyCahr9dsUGNFSeD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
