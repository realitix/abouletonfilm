The ballet retains much of its original character, thanks in part to Lacotte's faithful choreography and Luisa Spinatelli's authentic sets and costumes, which were modeled after the originals.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
