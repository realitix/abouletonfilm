Over his 41 years of service in the Israeli Air Force, Uri downed many enemy planes and he can't hide the pride he feels: 'I'm the only pilot who downed planes in all the wars. Two of them hit the cockpit.' Yet Uri claims to have never gloated: 'I was never happy afterwards. I like to show the enemy some respect. ' Battle-hardened, he admits to 'flourishing in wars.' For him, the key character components of any good soldier are an ability to adapt and an understanding of sacrifice.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
