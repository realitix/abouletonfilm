This video is about what it feels like to leave a  place in which one has spent more time than any other place, and which was also  the place of my family life. I am somewhere else now. It\u2019s about beginning of growing roots in a new place, new home, with new friends, new thoughts, experiences.  This video is also about video. When in 1949 I began filming with my Bolex, it  took me fifteen years to really master it so that my Bolex would do for me what I  wanted. When in 1987 I got my first Sony camera I thought it would be different.  But no. Only today, after working with the video camera for fifteen years, I feel like it had become an extension of my eye, my body, \"A Letter from Greenpoint\" being my first real video work.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bka83RkOopt6Al2FZ3TDfJg6535.jpg", "actors": ["Jonas Mekas (Mekas)", "Benn Northover (Benn)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
