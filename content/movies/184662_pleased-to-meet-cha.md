They both come in, and whenever Olive isn't looking, they start fighting. She catches them, and tells them one will have to leave. Bluto tells Popey that whoever does the best trick can stay. As a result, they find ever more creative ways to abuse each other, much to Olive's merriment. Eventually, though, they start destroying her house, and Olive throws them both out, for a little while, anyhow.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9nYieAZHqj5RwVZ1xnLZfNJhqtx.jpg", "actors": ["William 'Billy' Costello (Popeye)", "Mae Questel (Olive Oyl)", "William Pennell (Bluto)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
