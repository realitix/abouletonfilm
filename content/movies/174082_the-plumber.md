It is, nonetheless, very nicely performed, especially by Charles Murray who mugs it up freely and ineptly, as well as the pretty girl who plays the house's maid.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Charles Murray (Hogan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
