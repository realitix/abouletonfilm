(Jacques-Louis Mah\u00e9, a friend of Raymond Schwartz and under the pseudonym of 'Lorjak', had however already produced a silent Esperanto publicity film before World War II, titled Anta\u016den! (Onwards!).  At the start of the 1960s Mah\u00e9, a professional photographic and cinematic expert, invested in the production of the first fictional film in Esperanto. Using a scenario by Mah\u00e9 himself, the actors of the Internacia Arta Teatro (International Arts Theatre) presented a crime story, set in the Parisian periphery of petty thieves and cheats. Other notable people who played parts in the film included Schwartz (the commissioner), Gaston Waringhien (the voice-over) and many from the environs of the contemporary Paris, including a very young Michel Duc-Goninaz.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Michel Duc-Goninaz ()", "Raymond Schwartz (Komisaro)", "Gaston Waringhien (Rakontisto)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
