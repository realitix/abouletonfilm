It was the start of an extraordinary year they spent with the Liberian president as she struggled to take control of a country devastated by years of civil war.  Together with her 'iron ladies' (the finance minister and police chief are also formidable females), she takes a firm hold on the government, trying to root out corruption and spend the tiny annual budget carefully.
