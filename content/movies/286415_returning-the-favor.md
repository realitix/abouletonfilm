Although he studied hard for the university examinations and was successfully admitted to his first choice, [the prestigious] Tokyo University, he only managed to visit it for a day before passing away.  After that, last January [i.e. 2005], Kazunori's mother compiled the thoughts he had left behind and published it as a book, and it was adapted into this drama.  Even as Kazunori had to fight his serious illness, he received support from his friends, school teachers and family members, and had warm relations with many people. This drama illustrates the 1 year and 10 months young Kazunori persevered together with the people around him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ePzgbORECEcZCYbu9MWMsC28xi9.jpg", "actors": ["Kazunari Ninomiya (Kazunori Kitahara)", "Shinobu \u014ctake (Mikiko Kitahara)", "Chizuru Ikewaki (Mio Sasaki)", "Ryo Katsuji (Takumi Makiuchi)", "Masanobu Katsumura (Hiroaki Sakaki)", "Takehiro Murata (Ichiro Kitahara)", "Shigemitsu Ogi (Takatoshi Agawa)", "Issey Takahashi (Masaichi Kitahara)", "Kei Tani (Principal Tanokura)", "Shunsuke Dait\u00f4 ()", "Yosuke Asari ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
