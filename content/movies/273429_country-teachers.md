If she can become a certified, government employee, then she can teach her students and make a better life for herself at the same time. She carries a heavy responsibility, however. For most of her students, the education that they receive in her classroom is the only preparation they will have for the entrance exams to college-the only avenue out of poor, rural life. Can she balance her needs and the needs of so many young, hopeful people?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bzf0qje0GhE1EIPyP9pphJAkbUH.jpg", "actors": ["Li Bao-Tian (\u4f59\u6821\u957f)", "Wang Xue-qi (\u5b59\u56db\u6d77)", "Ding Jiali (\u9093\u59bb)", "Ju Xue (\u5f20\u82f1\u5b50)", "Zongdi Xiu (\u8205\u8205)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
