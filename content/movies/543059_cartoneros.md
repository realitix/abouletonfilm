The movie, which took two years to film, shows the process of sorting and selling the trash collected by cartoneros that work independently as well as by those who have created co-ops in order to protect themselves from abusive middle management. The documentary follows the trash through the whole process: from the neighborhood\u2019s sidewalk all the way to the paper mill. Among the many stages of garbage, the film also offers a reflection on the relation between garbage and art. This hour-long film unveils the complexity of informal recycling and its social, political and cultural implications.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yUFFkwzJp3L7prWXoG3fy8j7Z8B.jpg", "actors": ["Ernesto Livon-Grosman ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
