Each of these films is dedicated to both, a specific and title-giving object and its historical-critical analysis. Such as in \"Highway 40 West\": For a time span of 169 minutes, the film shows Bitomsky\u2019s emblematic US-road trip with a rented car on the eponymous road number 40, crossing the country from East to West. From early travel routes of the \"Native Americans\" to the trails of early colonizers, this street is loaded with American history - and with the present ruins of the American dream, which Bitomsky indulgingly captures on film. He himself appears as actor/author, conducting innumerable interviews, shooting the landscape, the diners and hotels - and his sonorous narrator\u2019s voice reviews what is seen, and tries to understand and make it understandable.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bzYoT165D3Eub6A6aAlcqyk389p.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
