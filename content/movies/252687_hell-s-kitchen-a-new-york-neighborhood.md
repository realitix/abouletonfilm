Through stories retold by painters, tatto artisits, barbers and other coloful characters we get the picture of a vibrant multi-ethnic neighborhood where people struggled to survive, get along and move ahead, at a time when real estate development and gentrification has started to push the low income housing residents away for the benefit of affluent professionals. Featuring a number of known people as themselves: John MIchael Boyer, Griffin Dunne, Lloyd Kaufmann, Charlie Sheen, Mira Sorvino, Ivy Supersonic and more. The film concludes with a revisit to the Hell's Kitchen of 2007, where the redevelopment transformation has all but been complete.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
