They wouldn\u2019t even go so far as to consider themselves friends. The only thing Tate and Miles have in common is an undeniable mutual attraction. Once their desires are out in the open, they realize they have the perfect set-up. He doesn\u2019t want love, she doesn\u2019t have time for love, so that just leaves the sex. Their arrangement could be surprisingly seamless, as long as Tate can stick to the only two rules Miles has for her.  Never ask about the past.\r Don\u2019t expect a future.  They think they can handle it, but realize almost immediately they can\u2019t handle it at all.  Hearts get infiltrated.\r Promises get broken.\r Rules get shattered.\r Love gets ugly.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9MCnAy8ZbHj6RaBU83I82ZhLVhM.jpg", "actors": ["Nick Bateman (Miles)", "Cody Hackman (Corbin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
