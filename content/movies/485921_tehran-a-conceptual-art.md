The glassy facades of this city\u2019s skyscrapers reflecting the passing by people of its diverse districts, shown in the reflection of distorted mirrors, symbolically depict the Spirit of a metropolis, as if it lives in its own shadows and reflections.  This distorted reflection of Tehran comes together with modern verses of a poet who was known as the Poet of Tehran after publishing his illustrious cycle of poems about Tehran in the 60s. As a fl\u00e2neur, the poet himself saunters around this city -through his voice/poem/memory- reflecting upon the reflections of old/modern monuments, sculptures, statues etc. of this giant metropolis.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iDVa5A8juow0lC5vhROeXcdF6P5.jpg", "actors": ["Mohammad Ali Sepanlou ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
