Around the lake are sixteen stones that represent sixteen people. We also see Luyken\u2019s sons canoeing and skiing. The black and white images have been coloured by hand.  Stones and canoes are recurring elements in Luyken\u2019s life and films.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Eva van Heyningen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
