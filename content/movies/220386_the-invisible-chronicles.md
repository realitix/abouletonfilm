A few days earlier, at the local university, he made an incredible breakthrough with his experiments involving invisibility. Not content to experiment on inanimate objects, he injected his invisibility serum into himself. At first, he reveled in achieving his life-long dream of becoming invisible ... but once he realized that the effects were permanent, his harmless excursions into eavesdropping and voyeurism turned murderous. Now, his enemies will suffer and even his friends are no longer safe as he hunts them down, one by one, within the confines of the deserted university campus.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7BWnsGVuZArLvqTMOnMHoI97q9B.jpg", "actors": ["Danny Max (Proctor)", "Trevor Duke-Moretz (Griffin)", "Kyle Leatherberry (Tom)", "Bryan Lillis (Jordan)", "Dominick Monteleone (Stewart)", "Oskar Rodriguez (Bobby)", "Chaz Wood (Roger)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
