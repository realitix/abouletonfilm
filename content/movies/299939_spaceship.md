I loved it.  Was skeptical at first, don't like horror movies, but watched it anyway because it is by David Hewlett!  I was intrigued from the beginning, even with a slow start, given all the fast action movies being released. This one grabs you and leads you into a great story line. I would love to write about some of the characters, but don't want to give anything away. The young actors did an amazing job. \r\nI felt as if it had a bit of a psychological twist. I love psychological thrillers. Scary that this might just happen in the future. Needs to be seen on the big screen! David needs to write and direct more movies. Thank you Mr. Hewlett! You never stop amazing me."}], "recommandations_id": [196830, 219288, 233734, 239019], "youtube_key": "zgAYqQH2m4Q"}
