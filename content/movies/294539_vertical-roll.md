The camera gazes at Jonas, implicating the viewer in the work and further, with her body. Her intentional de-synchronization of the monitor's receiving and transmitting frequencies results in the on-screen image's repeated vertical descent. Creating a sense of fragmentation, the vertical roll relentlessly pounds at the images of the artist as she moves through a series of performed identities. Characterized a \"disjunctive self portrait\" by the Electronic Arts Intermix, the image content of the work is strongly mediated by the mirror-like function of the camera, scrutinized by the lens and subjected to violence by the vertical roll.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wHwl6NaINuwhMcNEr11Gv5hicxU.jpg", "actors": ["Joan Jonas (Organic Honey)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
