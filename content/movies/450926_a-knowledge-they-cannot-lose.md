Constructing and deconstructing a portrait, she weaves family and friends\u2019 remembrances with an inquiry into her own work process. Her searching attitude suggests that with the loss of her father came a question of the role, not of a particular father, but the father figure\u2014a refusal of authority, and an appreciation of her father\u2019s cycles of learning, teaching, learning. As Danny Kaye, playing Hans Christian Andersen, tells a group of children the story of the piece of chalk that saw itself as a the source, not the transmitter of knowledge, one senses Fonoroff\u2019s sorrow at the loss inherent in the film image, and a yearning for the source of the image, not just its projection.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ldPLIvwOaY3RNrk6fJJEnEgFKdu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
