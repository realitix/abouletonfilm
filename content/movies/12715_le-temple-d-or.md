Yet it's a glorious cheese sandwich of a movie, a ball of laughs and high energy jinks, a pic where Chuck Norris, Louis Gosset Jr. and Melody Anderson are having fun and not taking it as seriously as some film punters have.\r\n\r\nStandard rules apply here, two adventure seeking guys, very buddy buddy and playing off of each other with sarcasm and respect in equal measure, hook up with a sexy gal who has a treasure map - oh and she has a gift involving visions type of thing. Cue lots of scrapes, arguing, bit of romance, more peril, over the top bad guy (Sonny Landham) and a friend in need (an over the top John Rhys- Davies).\r\n\r\nIn this one we get to see some of Norris' martial arts skills, especially during an action packed bar-room brawl, while the intentional comedy hits the required part of the funny bone (a swimming sequence and the use of religious disguises are particularly fun packed). If you be so inclined then you can easily find problems and weaknesses in the production and technical aspects, but roll with it in the name of mindless entertainment and you can have a blast. I know I did. 7/10"}], "recommandations_id": [38950, 16113, 14854, 20721]}
