Besides Atwill, six other controversial Bible scholars weigh in, showing that the teachings of Christ came from the ancient pagan mystery schools, and that Christianity was used as a political tool to control the masses of the day and is still being used this way today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lH585GeiMdB866ge19Tkr5wclxU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [88199, 29420, 56192, 97132], "youtube_key": "SUPoLMW6dNM"}
