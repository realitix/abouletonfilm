They have to perform at the kingdom's Jubilee Celebrations. But coming to the kingdom, they use their natural goodness and curiosity to find out that all is not well in the kingdom. There is exploitation of poor farmers and diamond-miners. There are sycophant courtiers and ruthless armies. And there is a mad scientist with this Brain-washing machine. With the help of an upright school-master, Goopi and Bagha set out to correct the evils... with the help of their ghost-given skills, fast thinking and an impish sense of humour.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a6NAgWmSaRhNdMgcm9S2UmL6xFR.jpg", "actors": ["Soumitra Chatterjee (Pondit Moshai)", "Utpal Dutt (Hirak Raja)", "Tapan Chatterjee (Goopy Gayen)", "Santosh Dutta (Scientist/ King of Sundhi)", "Rabi Ghosh (Bagha Bayen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [135092, 165432, 113012, 41781], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
