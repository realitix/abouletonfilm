The story brings together an engaging mix of human passions, supernatural forces, and the transcendent power of self-sacrificing love. The production by Sir Peter Wright catches the atmosphere of this great Romantic ballet, especially in the perfection of its White Act, with ghostly maidens drifting through the forest in spectacular patterns \u2013 one of the most famous of any scenes for the corps de ballet. Giselle dances with lightness and fragility, giving the impression of floating through the mist.  This is one of The Royal Ballet\u2019s most loved and admired productions, faithful to the spirit of the 1841 original yet always fresh at each revival. This performance features former Bolshoi star and now Royal Ballet Principal Natalia Osipova in a breath-taking interpretation of the title role.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Natalia Osipova (Giselle)", "Carlos Acosta (Albrecht)", "Thomas Whitehea (Hilarion)", "Johannes Stepanek (Wildred)", "Deirdre Chapma (Berthe)", "Christopher Saunders (The Duke)", "Christina Arestis (Bathilde)", "Elizabeth Harrod (Moyna)", "Akane Takada (Zulme)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
