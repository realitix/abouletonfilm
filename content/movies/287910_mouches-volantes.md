These lyrical fragments sweep in and out as with the tides; a time-based symmetry slowly emerges as the film reveals itself to be a perfect circle.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5lPnyXmTB2zLeLU6PvxcInj5vfE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
