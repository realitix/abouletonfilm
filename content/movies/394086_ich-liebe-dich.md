He\u2019s far from right:  There\u2019s the hugely admired Eve, whom he\u2019s decided will be the love of his life, but who isn\u2019t in the slightest bit impressed with either him or his Dollars.  To finally be able to talk to her without being disturbed so he can express his feelings, he slips a mickey in her drink and  takes her to the house of his friend Max.  When Eve finally emerges from the drug-induced nap forced upon her, Percy admits his love (!) and is told to drop dead.  And this is their idea of a romantic comedy?!?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uaxfXjHndbNjHYYaogtcGIRh4RH.jpg", "actors": ["Viktor de Kowa (Amerikaner Percy)", "Luise Ullrich (Fotografin Eva)", "Herbert Wei\u00dfbach (Percys Freund G\u00fcnther)", "Olga Limburg ()", "Joachim Rake ()", "Arthur Reinhardt ()", "Helmut Heyne ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
