In this first Cuban feature film made by an Afro-Cuban and by a woman, Sara G\u00f3mez uses innovative documentary and fictional techniques to focus on the marginales in the poorest, most underdeveloped areas of Cuba.  Against a backdrop of dismantled slums and new housing construction, the relationship between a mulatta and a Black Cuban unfolds as a conflict between ingrown ideas of race, class and gender and a Revolution that is trying to dismantle the old, outmoded structures.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xe97ENEgHYtWk6LSZOuvl6xEk5B.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
