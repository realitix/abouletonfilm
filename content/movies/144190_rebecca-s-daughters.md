Young aristocrat Anthony Raine returns home from India to find the farmers of Pembrokeshire protesting about the rates of a tollgate run by something called \"The Whitman Turnpike Trust\", headed by the drunken Lord Sarn (Peter O'Toole).  So Raine dresses up as a woman, calls himself Rebecca, and leads the common people to victory over their masters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oV4jjkjcoWD5fUX0l25cEgr2KOV.jpg", "actors": ["Peter O'Toole (Lord Sarn)", "Paul Rhys (Anthony Raine)", "Joely Richardson (Rhiannon)", "Dafydd Hywel (Rhodri Hughes)", "Sue Roderick (Sarah Hughes)", "Simon Dormandy (Capt.
