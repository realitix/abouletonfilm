It is the story of a wanderer who prefers to seek, through his flute, the spirit of truth, that he may give it out into the world as he passes through his various journeys and experiences in life and thus make earth a better and fairer place. He prefers this to the perpetual strife for gain.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7OwcFyVJNrHo8Bz1YhvGQnftZwV.jpg", "actors": ["Henry B.
