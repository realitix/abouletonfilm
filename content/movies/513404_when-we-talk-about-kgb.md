People were followed and photographed; restaurant dinner plates were bugged to catch potentially illicit conversations; car accidents were staged to waylay people while surveillance equipment was installed in their apartments; and many were detained, interrogated, imprisoned, or worse. Through expertly assembled KGB archival footage, earnest present-day interviews, and cleverly crafted returns-to-the-scene-of-the-crime, directors Max\u00ec Dejoie and Virginija Vareikyt\u00e9 present an acutely compelling contemplation of a \u201cnon war\u201d from both sides.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ftRO5g2lpamBKaRLa4SBkLqyTVM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "mjZC5GaL5cM"}
