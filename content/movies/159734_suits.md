The advertising satire follows the New York firm of Cranston &amp; Co. as they fight rival Hoffman &amp; Partners. Cranston fires his creative director which puts a young copywriter with a literature degree on the front line, even though he doesn't want to be. The contest comes down to a schmaltzy campaign by Hoffman with music by Air Supply that uses the tagline \"Vorcan: your own personal air supply.\" or a more down to earth campaign from Cranston of \"The pad ain't bad!\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1vzCmTHAQp3nZPylqmtYjdCz6NU.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Klein (Tom Cranston)", "Larry Pine (Peter Haverford)", "Paul Lazar (Mitchell Mitnick)", "Randy Pearlstein (Ken Tuttle)", "Ingrid Rogers (Anita Tanner)", "James Villemaire (Doug Humphrey)", "Mark Lake (Harson Covington)", "Joelle Carter (Heidi Wilson)", "Eben Moore (Rodney De Mole)", "Tony Hendra (George Parkyn)", "Steve Carell (United Standards 2)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "M26ePZlXAzQ"}
