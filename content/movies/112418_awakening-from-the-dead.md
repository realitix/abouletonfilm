Forty-year-old Mickey, an unaccomplished writer, a disillusioned assistant professor at the Faculty of Fine Arts, a discouraged democrat and a columnist, dismissed from a famous daily newspaper, emerges from his own grave and enters into his own life. Within 48 hours, he will try to achieve all those things he couldn't while he was alive. At the same time, post-mortem, he will try to save the dignity of his own community and his tribe, not taking too much care of himself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jvH9JPyhYgGtwCFNn7OqbQbigtu.jpg", "actors": ["Svetozar Cvetkovi\u0107 (Miki)", "Ljuba Tadi\u0107 (Otac)", "Anita Man\u010di\u0107 (D\u017eoja)", "Tihomir Stani\u0107 (Rale)", "Aleksandra Jankovi\u0107 (Tamara)", "Ana Frani\u0107 (Nagorka)", "Vanja Andri\u0107 (Mali Petar)", "Svetislav Gonci\u0107 (Zoki)", "Nenad \u0106iri\u0107 (Kole)", "Dragoljub Vojnov (Prodavac benzina)", "Tatjana Torbica (Policajka)", "Aleksandar Gruden (Matori rezervista)", "Aleksandar \u0110urica (Loca)", "\u0110or\u0111e Teodosi\u0107 (Ne\u0161a)", "Jelena \u0106uruvija (Milka)", "Dejana Miladinovi\u0107 (Monika)", "Ratiborka \u0106eramilac (Gospo\u0111ica Smrt)", "Tijana \u0110okovi\u0107 (Medicinska sestra I)", "Ivana Sirkovi\u0107 (Medicinska sestra II)", "Ilija Sirkovi\u0107 (Hajrudin)", "Luka Kosti\u0107 (Bahrudin)", "Aleksandar Sirkovi\u0107 (Bolni\u010dar I)", "Slavi\u0161a Ivanovi\u0107 (Bolni\u010dar II)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
