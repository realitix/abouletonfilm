{"tmdb_id": 566848, "title": "Gary and the Underworld", "original_title": "Gary and the Underworld", "slug_title": "gary-and-the-underworld", "date": "", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "On Gary's first day of being homeless, he delves into his new situation with charming resilience--from an attempt at urban homesteading that is at once inspiring and absurd to some creative financing in the name of SunnyD. But it's not until a mysterious goth girl, Tara, inadvertently leads him into a dreamlike world of sinister forces that he is truly challenged and realizes sometimes you've gotta go down in order to rise up. Gary and the Underworld is a super-stylish, no-dialogue feature that speaks through an awesome original soundtrack and immersive imagery to tell a tale of human kindness that addresses--and grapples with--the assumptions we make about what it means to have and have not.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uYLnQauBjgQ4RtT6YAgMpYCLsWA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
