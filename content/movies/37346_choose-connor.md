He has no friends, spends almost all of his time studying, and has an almost nonexistent relationship with his white-collar parents, whom he sees for ten minutes a day. But his boring suburban life changes when he meets Congressman Lawrence Connor and his young nephew Caleb. Connor is immediately taken with Owen\u2019s intelligence and wit, and Caleb is immediately taken with Owen. As Caleb and Owen become close friends, Connor offers Owen a chance to learn how the world of politics really works by acting as his \u201cyouth campaign spokesman\u201d for the upcoming Senate primaries.
