Selznick. Selznick's changes are mainly:- (1) Adding a prologue. (2) Adding scenes explaining things, often by putting labels or inscriptions on them. (3) Adding more close-ups of Jennifer Jones. He also deleted a few scenes that he felt weren't dramatic enough. Sadly some of these were major plot points so the story doesn't make as much sense as the original.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gKPjZKgMqf6l7tVt8NTY6bja3yf.jpg", "actors": ["Jennifer Jones (Hazel Woodus)", "David Farrar (Jack Reddin)", "Cyril Cusack (Edward Marston)", "Sybil Thorndike (Mrs. Marston)", "Hugh Griffith (Andrew Vessons)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [83119, 196784, 47026, 72460], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
