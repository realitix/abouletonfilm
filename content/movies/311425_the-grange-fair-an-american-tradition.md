Now in its 131st year, the week-long Centre County Grange Fair in Pennsylvania boasts a small city of almost a thousand residential tents. This is a highly-narrative story, presented without voice-over and driven entirely by the passionate words of those involved. It is a story of triumph, sibling rivalry, unrequited love, loss, family, and tradition. The film follows eight individual characters throughout the year leading up to the fair, and then presents their dramatic tales as their paths cross at the event itself.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
