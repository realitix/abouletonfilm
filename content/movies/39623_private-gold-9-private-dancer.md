The story starts when Jane Dancer is mugged and knocked unconscious on her way home late one night. She wakes up on a park bench with complete amnesia (and a horny stranger by her side). Confused and lost, she succums to the stranger and begins a sordid jaunt through Budapest's sleazy and depraved night life, searching for clues to who (and what) she is. Her journey for answers leads to a sexual awakening, creating a series of scorching sexual encounters in public parks, at a fire station, in a warehouse, in a restaurant, and a strip club filled with sexy strippers and horny men. Leading the cast of over twenty girls is sensational newcomer Ivy Crystal (as Jane Dancer), a stunning doe-eyed brunette and native Hungarian that is surely destined for stardom.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t5Efe3D9kBoBfIFHtWRDhbp61Cj.jpg", "actors": ["Baby Doll ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
