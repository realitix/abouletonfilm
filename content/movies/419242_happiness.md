But Yuk's hopes are dashed on finding his dad has a new family and considers him a burden. Alone and homeless, Yuk is taken in by Auntie Fen, a middle-aged recluse who leads a solitary existence. At first, their different habits and personalities lead to numerous squabbles, intensified by Yuk's self-centeredness and Fen's odd temperament. As time goes on, Yuk learns Fen is in the early stages of Alzheimer's. The discovery unexpectedly serves as a catalyst for the young man's growth as a caring friend. For the first time in her life, Fen feels truly blessed. But it is a situation rife with irony due to the nature of her disease and the accelerating elusiveness of feelings and memories.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dZYpHIl976tlkBa3PeAAwGwQSKH.jpg", "actors": ["Kara Hui (Auntie Fen)", "Carlos Chan (Chan Kai-Yuk)", "Liu Yase (Xiaoyue)", "Louis Cheung ()", "Yan Ng ()", "James Ng Yip-Kwan ()", "Lawrence Chou ()", "Stephanie Che ()", "Celia Kwok ()", "Siu Yam-Yam ()", "\u94b1\u5c0f\u8c6a ()", "Teresa Mak ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [380762], "youtube_key": "a-Dw9pgzge0"}
