He uses his body for all kinds of dangerous experiments (I don't believe he was anytime in danger at all). He checks up the Hanging, Gas Chamber,Lethal Injections and the Electric Chair. Eventually, he finds a total painless \"humane\" way to execute people and animals. But apparently the executioners aren't looking for a humane way to execute. What eventually he may have found, is a humane way to kill farm animals. I don't want any killing, not convicts nor animals.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w22PKXnoB7cReiYI4KkJ6Suf5qh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
