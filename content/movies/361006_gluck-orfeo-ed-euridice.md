A splendid cast as well as an avant-garde production that makes extensive use of large projection screens and includes the members of the orchestra as actors onstage result in one of the most exciting opera performances in recent years. La Fura's concept is surprising and its originality demands our attention ... it gives rise to moments of great beauty and evocative power (El Pa\u00eds).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ivZ8V3UqdZdiuWxm4p78T1uV0Vg.jpg", "actors": ["Anita Rachvelishvili (Orfeo)", "Maite Alberola (Euridice)", "Auxiliadora Toledano (Amore)", "Aline Vincent (Dancer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
