Cirque banked its success on the North American West by performing outside their native Canada at the Los Angeles Festival in summer 1987. From there the show cross-crossed the North American Continent before picking up stakes and traveling across the pond to England and France. By today's standards the production is a simple one, without story or theme, but if you look hard enough you can see a simple thread, the beginnings of a tapestry.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6j7vfBYcdgXx7S9ErwQ0SZ3B3EG.jpg", "actors": ["Cirque du Soleil (themselves)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
