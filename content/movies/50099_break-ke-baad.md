Abhay who is still unsure about what he wants to do finds himself competing with Aaliya's incessant plans and projects to fulfill her dreams. While their relationship blooms because of their personality differences, the baggage because of these differences also grows silently. Things come to a head when Aaliya decides to go to Australia to study and Abhay has to deal with the prospect of a long term relationship, secretly fearing that he will lose Aaliya forever.
