As the film opens, punch-permed lieutenant Ginji (Riki Takeuchi) is killed while pumping iron. Following the hit, rumors and recriminations abound, slowly corroding the clan's cohesion. Ginji, it turns out, was mired in debt. After Ginji borrowed a small fortune to build a luxury resort, his bank went belly up and stopped financing the loan. Frantic for funds, he decided as a last resort to rat out his boss who had skimmed five-billion yen from the gang. Soon everyone assumes that Idei did the hit. Convinced that Idei is being framed, Tamaki sets out to find the real killer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A9SdApndMQdPE56fKwRJSXnqWeQ.jpg", "actors": ["Kanako Fukaura ()", "Naoki Hosaka ()", "Sh\u00f4ko Ieda ()", "Ai Maeda ()", "Naoya Makoto ()", "Yutaka Matsushige ()", "Misaki Mori ()", "Naomasa Musaka ()", "Tadashi Naruse ()", "Minoru Ohki ()", "Hideo Sakaki ()", "Shun Sugata ()", "Aya Sugimoto ()", "Reiko Takashima ()", "Susumu Terajima ()", "Jundai Yamada ()", "Michihiro Yamanishi ()", "Akira Yano ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
