He has discovered the elixir of life. Lions attack their house killing him, while his wife goes mad with grief. Ramu\u2019s son, Leher, and their little dog Moti, escape with the help of a half-man, half-ape called Dada (Boman Shroff). Several people arrive in the jungle fifteen years later from the city. One of them is Ramu\u2019s father with his adopted daughter, Leela. Bihari, one of the people in the group wants the formula for his own purpose. The formula was put in a pendant around Leher\u2019s neck by his father before he died. Leher now grown-up and known as Tarzan (John Cawas), has been brought up in the jungle and there are some amusing incidents between Leela and Tarzan, due to his lack of language skills. Tarzan saves Leela from Bihari\u2019s unwanted advances.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ryIufLHDHxQYXNBeDRQBnKVRm4L.jpg", "actors": ["John Cawas (Tarzan)", "Gulshan (Leela)", "Boman Shroff ()", "Chandrashekhar ()", "Dog Moti ()", "Nazira Ali ()", "Dalpat ()", "Ahmed Dilawar ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
