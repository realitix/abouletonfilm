Made with the assistance of the Red Bull Media House, Hurt So Good promises more of the same, only we can expect the action to be even more intense. The housemates are joined by the usual array of freeskiing pals in tackling self-built obstacles up various mountains to a pumping hard-rock soundtrack.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Ao1CnNZnDIX4y3WtLOyuwYNuRaX.jpg", "actors": ["Frej Jonsson ()", "Max Hill ()", "Jossi Wells ()", "Bene Mayr ()", "Sam Smoothy ()", "Paddy Graham ()", "Tobi Reindl ()", "Thomas Hlawitschka ()", "Tobi Tritscher ()", "Sebastian Hannemann ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
