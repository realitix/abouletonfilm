The CD has been a runaway success... and now the album is brought to a vibrant and entertaining life with the much-anticipated release of I Like To Sing! on DVD. Full of catchy and well crafted melodies penned by composer and Play School pianist Peter Dasent, I Like To Sing! is a series of video clips set to the music from the album.
