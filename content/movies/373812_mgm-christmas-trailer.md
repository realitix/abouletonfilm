MGM filmed the event in color for use in their 1937 Christmas trailer. The trailer opens with a shot of a small rural church in the snow, lighted up in the dark of night - a Christmas card effect. The camera then moves inside where we see Judy singing at the front of the choir.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Judy Garland (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
