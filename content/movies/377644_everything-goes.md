Within seconds the dude is on top of her and Angel gets her first 'taste' of 'Whiteland'.\"But fucking isn't the only thing they do in 'Whiteland'. Oh, no. For some unexplained reason Angel is forced to endure golf and tennis lessons (her second scene is a hot girl-on-girl with her tennis instructor), before she's allowed to relax by the pool and work on her tan. Let me tell you, folks, a Williams sister she ain't. When she finally throws down her racquet in frustration, she actually misses the ground!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/932tVLEKBS4ps1Fmwk3ZsJKF3N3.jpg", "actors": ["Marylin Guillaume (Marylin Guillaume)", "\u00c9lisabeth Bur\u00e9 (Martine (as Elizabeth Buret))", "Charlie Schreiner (Jacques)", "Erika Cool (Annie)", "Richard Allan (Paul)", "Herv\u00e9 Amalou (Pierre)", "Marie-Christine Chireix (Une femme de chambre)", "Jocelyne Clairis (Marie - la bonne de Martine)", "Martine Grimaud (Justine)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
