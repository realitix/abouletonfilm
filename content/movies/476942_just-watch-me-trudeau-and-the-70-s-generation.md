The film focuses particularly on Trudeau's goal of creating a thoroughly bilingual nation. Annau interviews eight people in their mid-30s on both sides of the linguistic divide. One tells of her life growing up in a community of hard-core Quebec separatists, while another, a yuppie from Toronto, recalls believing as a child that people in Montreal got drunk and had sex all day long. Annau has all of the interviewees discuss how Trudeau's policies affected their lives and their perceptions of the other side, in this issue that strikes to the heart of Canada's national identity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ekGP1GeMK5JMBUkidQSAtNOO6rm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
