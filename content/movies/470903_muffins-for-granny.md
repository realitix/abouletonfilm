McLaren tells the story of her own grandmother by combining precious home movie fragments with the stories of seven elders dramatically affected by their experiences in residential school. McLaren uses animation with a painterly visual approach to move the audience between the darkness of memory and the reality that these charismatic survivors live in today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g9v9ChzvUO1RcDWWIb1aHbxlDgh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
