This conference brings together leaders of business, economics, media, finance, politics and military in a forum which will allow for open and off the record discussions of current events and global issues. I must stress that this meeting is SECRET and by invitation only. We operate under Chatham House Rules, meaning you are not permitted to discuss anything that is said during the conference to members of the media or otherwise. Please keep all of your arrangements confidential, including all of the information included herein. In recent years we have lost much of our control over the dissemination of information due to the rise of independent media sources and internet-based journalists. We intend to correct this problem and plan to discuss it at this year\u2019s conference.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1kFhx1MwIct4mqS1O6pYHKLl8yJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "DcHszo89ugc"}
