Performing the artist\u2019s own writing integrated with fragments of James Joyce, the amalgamation of words read by Conti makes explicit Parreno\u2019s interest in artificial, digital, and organic matter, and particularly how these forms of life communicate. The film is comprised of long sequences of a live cuttlefish (Sepia Oficinalis \u2014 a Mediterranean species of cephalopod) that can change the surface of its body\u2014responding to outside forces such as light, sound and vibration, seemingly projecting the thoughts contained in the monologue. Much of the film focuses on the cuttlefish, which Parreno first kept in a tank in his studio.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
