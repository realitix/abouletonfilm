When Ahimsa was a young boy, a shaman had the mysterious man removed, but the man returns when Ahimsa is a young man and starts taking drugs and getting involved in rave culture. Ahimsa's behavior soon causes trouble for his friends, Ukhoht and Einstein, and a female physician, Dr. Pattaya.  The film was Thailand's official entry to the 79th Academy Awards. It was chosen after Pen-Ek Ratanaruang's \"Invisible Waves\" had been withdrawn by the Federation of National Film Associations of Thailand.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p5LjYPSMj3sU0mV03PkRZ3aCONP.jpg", "actors": ["Boriwat Yuto (Ahimsa)", "Theeradanai Suwannahom (Mysterious Man (Wen Gam))", "Prinya Ngamwongwarn (Ukhoht)", "Kiradej Ketakinta (Marut)", "Phitoon Laisakul (Oottee)", "Ampon Rattanawong (Man with Birdcages)", "Taranya Sattabusya (Dr. Pattaya)", "Johnny Unwa (Einstein)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
