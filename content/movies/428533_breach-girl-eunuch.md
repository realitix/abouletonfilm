The person inflicting her agony is also unheard and unseen, but has a tangible presence in the film.  As emotion is taken out of context, the viewer is almost placed in the position of the aggressor.  The tangible melts into the intangible and the other way around.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uX5gxaBGz5N04fycVoS5Xj7HKH4.jpg", "actors": ["Lara Belmont (Girl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
