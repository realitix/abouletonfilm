First off, their stepparents are despicably evil. Secondly, they seemed to have killed them. Now this mixed up mess of half-sisters and step-brothers have to figure out how to dispose of the bodies, cover up the murders, collect their grandfather's inheritance and somehow stick together as a family -- all without getting caught. Not to mention Joe's incessant need to keep tabs on his promiscuous sister, an eye on the precocious little ones and a lustful watch on the girl next-door. Growing up has its complications. Murder's just one of them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yUAH62tziURf4pBAaBsbluKSUzc.jpg", "actors": ["Alex Campbell (Joe)", "Paul Soles (Grandpa)", "Andrew Chalmers (Pete)", "Samantha Weinstein (Danielle)", "Sarah Gadon (Margaret)", "Nicholas Campbell (Dad)", "Sonja Smits (Mom)", "Sarah Polley (Tabby)", "Aaron Abrams (Pastor)", "Joan Heney (Agnes)", "Dorothy Gordon (Dorothy)", "William Lynn (Dr. Therminger (as Bill Lynn))", "Barbara Budd (Tabby's Mom)", "Shawn Roberts (Tom Muster)", "Martha Burns (Miss Bradford)", "Tom McCamus (Mr. Phillips)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
