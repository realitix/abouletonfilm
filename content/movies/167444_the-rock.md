Despite being declared enemies by their countries, they used to be inseparable. But in 1969, Francisco Franco, the fascist dictator of Spain, closed the entrance to the British territory of Gibraltar, isolating 30,000 people without food, water, or telephone lines. According to him, The Rock would fall like ripe fruit. Indoctrination on both sides eventually forced the separation of thousands of mixed families, who for over 13 years would meet at the border every Sunday to look through binoculars at their estranged lovers, brothers, parents and babies, screaming messages from a distance. La Roca tells the emotional tale of this important chapter of world history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xDkQYAA96Uj7EuAyhX0TdFsFJGy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "9dtL3EzOqKw"}
