A lot of people where asking on web sites if Slash, Bon Jovi, Steven Tyler and Joe Perry where on this show? No, it wouldve been nice to see them, but no, they are not on the show, there are no guests at all, there is a female who comes on later in the show to add some pretty good backing vocals tho, she really lifts the sound of the vocals.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eEtvkszXoZ5qyiXF8wMXlheKGgk.jpg", "actors": ["Alice Cooper (Vocals)", "Al Pitrelli (Guitars)", "Pete Freezin' (Guitars)", "Derek Sherinian (Keyboards)", "Tommy Caradonna (Bass)", "Jonathan Mover (Drums)", "Devon Meade (Backing Vocals)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
