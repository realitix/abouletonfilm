Sombra di Kol\u00f3 (The Shadow of Color) brings us into the world of thirty inhabitants of Dutch Caribbean island Cura\u00e7ao, and shows what influence race and skin color have on their daily lives.  When visiting for the summer cultural anthropologist Angela Roe hears from her Cura\u00e7aoan aunt that she had best not bring home a dark skinned sweetheart. Upset Roe decides to investigate the underlying motives of this \u2018rule:\u2019 why has Cura\u00e7ao struggled for centuries with a color hierarchy? Why is there such a strong taboo on talking about race and racism? And how do race and skin color continue to impact people today?  Her research takes her across the island, from a small village in the countryside to Spaanse Water, one of the richest neighborhoods of the island. She speaks with people about descent, class, family and Curacao\u2019s multicultural society.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
