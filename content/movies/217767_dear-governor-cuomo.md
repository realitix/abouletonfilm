Featuring local activists including Mark Ruffalo, 'Melissa Leo' , 'Natalie Merchant' , Pete Seeger, Citizen Cope and scientists like Sandra Steingraber, the film - a blend of 'The Last Waltz' and 'An Inconvenient Truth' lays out the science and facts behind the decision and encourages the governor to join the anti-fracking majority in his state. Though focused on the issue in New York, the education, and incredible music, are relevant in the 34 states that already allow fracking.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5HZxcxfVTdkvLBvEf1H40SwqGL0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
