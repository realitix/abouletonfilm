Award-winning filmmaker Rick McKay filmed over 100 of the greatest stars ever to work on Broadway or in Hollywood.  He soon learned that great films can be restored, fine literature can be kept in print - but historic Broadway performances of the past are the most endangered.  They leave only memories that, while more vivid, are more difficult to preserve.  In their own words - and not a moment too soon - Broadway: The Golden Age tells the stories of our theatrical legends, how they came to New York, and how they created this legendary century in American theatre.  This is the largest cast of legends ever in one film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w2B1uXosBBQEFmRr5Plx4XwCTK6.jpg", "actors": ["Edie Adams (Herself)", "Bea Arthur (Herself)", "Alec Baldwin (Himself)", "Kaye Ballard (Herself)", "Bryan Batt (Himself)", "Betsy Blair (Herself)", "Jim Borstelmann (Himself)", "Tom Bosley (Himself)", "Marlon Brando (Himself)", "Carol Burnett (Herself)", "Kitty Carlisle (Herself)", "Carol Channing (Herself)", "Barbara Cook (Herself)", "Carole Cook (Herself)", "Hume Cronyn (Himself)", "Nanette Fabray (Herself)", "Robert Goulet (Himself)", "Tammy Grimes (Herself)", "Uta Hagen (Herself)", "Julie Harris (Herself)", "Rosemary Harris (Herself)", "Ruthie Henshall (Herself)", "June Havoc (Herself)", "Celeste Holm (Herself)", "Sally Ann Howes (Herself)", "Jeremy Irons (Himself)", "Derek Jacobi (Himself)", "Lainie Kazan (Herself)", "Martin Landau (Himself)", "Frank Langella (Himself)", "Angela Lansbury (Herself)", "Carol Lawrence (Herself)", "Michele Lee (Herself)", "Hal Linden ()", "Shirley MacLaine (Herself)", "Karl Malden (Himself)", "Ann Miller (Herself)", "Liliane Montevecchi (Herself)", "Robert Morse (Himself)", "Patricia Neal (Herself)", "Jerry Orbach (Himself)", "Janis Paige (Herself)", "Jane Powell (Herself)", "John Raitt (Himself)", "Charles Nelson Reilly (Himself)", "Chita Rivera (Herself)", "Tony Roberts (Himself)", "Diana Rigg (Herself)", "Gena Rowlands (Herself)", "Eva Marie Saint (Herself)", "Douglas Sills (Himself)", "Marian Seldes (Himself)", "Stephen Sondheim (Himself)", "Kim Stanley (Herself)", "Maureen Stapleton (Herself)", "Elaine Stritch (Herself)", "Tommy Tune (Himself)", "Mary Testa (Herself)", "Leslie Uggams (Herself)", "Gwen Verdon (Herself)", "Eli Wallach (Himself)", "Fay Wray (Herself)", "Karen Ziemba (Herself)", "Ben Gazzara (Himself)", "Elizabeth Ashley (Herself)", "Betty Comden (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
