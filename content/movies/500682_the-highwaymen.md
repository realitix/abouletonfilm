You'll love this film."}, {"pseudo": "Wuchak", "content": "***Tracking down Bonnie & Clyde***\r\n\r\nBased on the real story, two renowned retired Texas Rangers (Kevin Costner & Woody Harrelson) are commissioned to track down and execute Bonnie & Clyde in 1934 after other authorities have failed.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Highwaymen\u201d (1983) is a great counterbalance to the 1967 movie with Beatty & Dunaway, which painted the thugs more sympathetically, as well as the excellent \u201cBonnie & Clyde: The True Story\u201d (1992). \r\n\r\nThe filmmakers shoot for realism rather than the thrills of, say, James Bond or Batman. And by \"realism\" I don't mean exact historical accuracy; movies never are for many reasons. For instance, Frank Hamer never approached Bonnie & Clyde from the front of their vehicle. Hamer & co. just blew them to smithereens as soon as it was determined it was rogue couple. \r\n\r\nThe picture is a reverent period piece about life in the Great Depression and the pursuit & execution of the infamous duo by a couple of aged, but experienced men. The film has the confidence to take its time, unlike say \"Aquaman,\u201d which anxiously jumped to a wild action scene just when a dramatic part was getting interesting. If \"The Highwaymen\" is sometimes slow & boring it's because the actual pursuit was also slow and often boring. This is not a flick for people with ADHD who demand an explosion every 5-7 minutes. It's for people who favor period pieces like \"The Whole Wide World,\" \"Cross Creek,\" \"Of Mice and Men,\" \u201cThe Cider House Rules,\u201d \"The Green Mile\" and \"Water for Elephants.\"\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 2 hours, 12 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+/A-"}], "recommandations_id": [399361, 483906, 527261, 454227]}
