The boy, Tim (Andrew Hawley), also acts as a go-between for his friend Carns (Liam Neeson) who is having an affair with a married woman (Miranda Richardson). Eventually, things start to sort themselves out, and Tim sees life getting more interesting when he and his friend Win (Kate Foster) slowly get a relationship going.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bLVte4bGNZHJ0KiHmWA8Pd2EwVX.jpg", "actors": ["Andrew Hawley (Timothy 'Tim' Dobson)", "Kika Markham (Mrs. Dobson)", "Liam Neeson (John Carns)", "Patrick Daley (Eddie King)", "Paul Askew (Stanley)", "Lorraine Peters (Win's grandmother)", "Tom Bell (Frank Dobson)", "Richard Hope (Mouth Organ Player)", "Jack Carr (Mill Owner)", "Clive Wood (Turner)", "Miranda Richardson (Mary Turner)", "Richard Laxton (Reg Reid)", "Denis Lill (Doctor)", "Alison Lloyd (Wool Shop Owner)", "Bill Rodgers (Drinks Bearer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
