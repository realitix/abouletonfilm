Music is by Otto Ferrari and cinematography by Ernest Palmer.\r\n\r\nA novelist wakes up to find a gun in his hand a relative murdered nearby. Did he do it?\r\n\r\nWho cares is the serious answer after sitting through this most turgid of \"Z\" grade Brit crime mysteries. There's just about enough material here to have made a half hour episode of some low rent Private Investigator show, but even then the logic holes and crumbling direction would struggle to hold the attention of the intelligent of mind. Also features one of the most irritating musical scores of the 50s (shudder). 2/10"}], "recommandations_id": [25548, 73983, 35418, 51153], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
