New technologies and scientific ingenuity have given rise to genetically modified organisms (GMO) and other novel foods. Some people have raised concerns about the safety of GMOs in our food supply, given their incredible dominance in the majority of our diet. Traditional, organic farmers, have consistently been under attack by large corporate farming interests, who seek to dominate the food industry and run family farms out of business. This film looks at our current food system as well as a variety of smaller, organic options available to consumers who want to support sustainable farming methods.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g3mK0PFE0IdhWepozP0IK0fPEzI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
