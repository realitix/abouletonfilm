The actress marries a banker in a fit of pique only to quickly discover the divorce was not valid. She communicates this information to her not-yet ex-husband and he, to prevent consummation of the invalid marriage rescues her by sending plumbers, waiters, porters, chambermaids, bellhops, desk clerks, exterminators and, finally, a crowd of roistering conventioneers to the suite to ensure no bedtime story would take place there", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/48hgDJAQ6Tlvqjm66gjtHDs1Nap.jpg", "actors": ["Fredric March (Luke Drake)", "Loretta Young (Jane Drake)", "Robert Benchley (Eddie Turner)", "Allyn Joslyn (William Dudley)", "Eve Arden (Virginia Cole)", "Helen Westley (Emma Harper)", "Joyce Compton (Beulah)", "Tim Ryan (Mac)", "Olaf Hytten (Alfred)", "Dorothy Adams (Betsy)", "Clarence Kolb (Collins)", "Andrew Tombes (Pierce)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
