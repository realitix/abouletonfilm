Will justice be served for the lost innocent lives? The conclusion of the famed Jidaigeki series is an amazing film, with a completely different perspective on the story from the later versions. While the international audience is more familiar with the \u201cSword of Doom\u201d and \u201cSatan\u2019s Sword\u201d versions of Daibosatsu Toge (The Great Bodhisattva Pass), the \u201cSouls in the Moonlight\u201d trilogy casts an entirely different light on Ryunosuke and his motives. Can this brutal killer be brought to justice, or is living his life as a blind wanderer a more terrible fate? His sword skills have not diminished, nor has his desire to kill!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ebGorUfdlhFwyNgS4wb3Lrz5RvZ.jpg", "actors": ["Chiez\u00f4 Kataoka (Ry\u00fbnosuke Tsukue)", "Yumiko Hasegawa (Ohama / Otoyo)", "Satomi Oka (Omatsu)", "Michiko Hoshi (Okimi)", "Chizuru Kitagawa (Ogin-sama)", "Ry\u00fbnosuke Tsukigata (Shichibei)", "Isao Yamagata (Kamio Shuzen)", "Akitake K\u00f4no ()", "Sadako Sawamura ()", "Harumi Urazato (Okinu)", "Yoshiharu Ueki ()", "Shin Tokudaiji ()", "Ushio Akashi ()", "Tetsunosuke Tsukigata ()", "Takeshi Osada ()", "Masanori Takeda ()", "Noboru Umezawa ()", "Otabe Michimaro ()", "Kazuo Tokita ()", "Akira Kishii ()", "Reiji Tsumura ()", "Shinichi Hamada ()", "Katsuya Ishimaru ()", "Shinnosuke Ogata ()", "Haruhiko Nishi ()", "Sh\u00fbjir\u00f4 Kijima ()", "Kin'ya Suzuki ()", "Toshikazu Sahashi ()", "Utako Tamaki ()", "Kisho Nomura ()", "Chiyonosuke Azuma (Komai Noto-no-kami)", "Kinnosuke Nakamura (Utsugi Hyoma)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
