Letian, leader of hip-hop dance group Encore, meets rich kid Mianmian when she enrols at a dance studio where he teaches. Mianmian's Latin dance partner-cum-fiance Ranqiu has asked her to take hip-hop lessons to expand her style so they can make a splash at a forthcoming competition in the U.S. Things don't go well at the start between the easygoing Letian and snooty Mianmian, and meanwhile Encore loses one of its key dancers, Wang Zi, when he signs a management contract with local dance-club owner Ye in order to pay his mother's medical bills. Between romancing Mianmian, Letian has to prove that Encore still has the goods.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c0aYOZWY4SfCoi5zWYdZhYCCWjK.jpg", "actors": ["Chen Bolin (Letian)", "Cica Zhou (Mianmian)", "Michael Tse (Ranqiu)", "Chiu Sheng-yi (Prince)", "Shi Tianqi (Red Sleeve)", "Lu Xiner (Coco)", "Lin Zhenghao (Peter)", "Liu Meiman (Momo)", "Ma Jing (Ye)", "Chen Jia (Meat Bun)", "James Blackston (Stallion)", "Fan Bingbing ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
