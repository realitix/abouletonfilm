For within her she carries the hope for all existence, and as an ancient prophecy from beyond this world begins to unfold, her own hidden destiny is revealed. But as a growing evil begins to take shape, the tides are shifted against those that would see the prophecy fulfilled, and a war started 1000 years before begins again here on Earth.\r - Written by Nathan Hall", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
