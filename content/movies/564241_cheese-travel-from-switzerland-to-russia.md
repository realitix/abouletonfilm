The tradition of making baked cheese dates back to 1795. The first cheese, named \"Meschersky\", was made in the home of Prince Meschersky in his estate of Lotochino. The sign of the village of Lotochina represents until now a merchant with a cheese wheel on a board. The prince had then brought from Switzerland a cheese maker named Johan M\u00fcller who developed a cheese recipe, founded a cheese-making school and settled in Russia with his family. Today, we managed to find his descendants; they live and work in the Alps. And make cheese. Very similar to the famous \"Meschersky\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fGwN67nYdjykTEyLk3GRTN61NSH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
