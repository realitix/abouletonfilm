In anger, Eun-hae smashes up her boyfriend's car; in frustration, Min-gyu breaks glasses and carves up a spider. Min-gyu and Eun-hae each urge the other to be calm, to move on, to forget about it. Good advice, if only they could take it. \"Why do humans need love?,\" these friends ask each other. Can jealousy, anger, and desire for revenge lead two jilted lovers to embrace what they have? Will someone dream of a giraffe?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ZHH9kzLQTQ805EhsmfQ90Dpqgb.jpg", "actors": ["Kim Hee-seon (Eun-hae)", "Jang Dong-gun (Min-gyu)", "Lee Jin-woo (Jin-woo)", "Park So-hyun (So-jung)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
