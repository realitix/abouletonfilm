As Boris, the renowned Yevgeni Neterenko is as justifiably identified with the role in his generation as Chaliapin, London and Kipness were in theirs. Nesterenko gives a remarkably vivid, human portrait of the tormented half-crazed Tsar, and is supported by a first rate ensemble in a richly designed and costumed production that represents opera at its grandest. Particularly outstanding are Vladislav Piavko as the Pretender, Valery Yaroslavtsev as Pimen, Irina Arkhipova as Marina (a role generally associated with Vishnevskaya), Galina Kalinina as Xenia, and Alexsei Maslennikov as the Simpleton.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/alKMLlQJYy1sAjo8W0bKtQkRdJ3.jpg", "actors": ["Irina Arkhipova (Marina Mnichek)", "Galina Kalinina (Xenia)", "Glafira Korolyova (Fyodor)", "Aleksei Maslennikov (Simpleton)", "Yevgeni Nesterenko (Boris Godunov)", "Vladislav Piavko (The pretender)", "Valery Yaroslavtsev (Pimen)", "Nina Grigorieva (Xenia's mother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
