Shake Dance is a documentary that takes viewers to a number of strip clubs in the Atlanta area, where some of the nation's best shake dancers show off their moves and talk about their jobs; some regard what they do as an art form and a means of personal expression, while others just look at dancing as a fast way to make a buck. Shake Dance features music from a handful of the South's leading dance music acts, including 95 South, Quad City Family, and 69 Boyz.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
