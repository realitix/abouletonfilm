It\u2019s a polyphony. Anonymous voices that intertwine and overlap, answer and contradict each other. A descent into the depths of a city, fragments of life found in the streets or through cracks in walls, a slow wandering through the secret strata of a neighbourhood\u2026 pieces of a puzzle that don't easily fit in with each other.\r Place: La Joliette, a port district of Marseilles; to be more precise: a single block, half of which will be reduced to dust during this \"walk around the block\", that turns out to be as unpredictable as it is systematic.\r Time: towards the end of the \u201creconquest\u201d of our cities, when fragile glass towers prospered on the ruins of relocated industries.\r Actors: some individuals, with conflicting interests, living in the midst of a development project that towers over them all, even those with the highest rank.\r The map of a sample of the world is sketched before our eyes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2vCO4FXiPj4UgQfg7YAbgoNqjjo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
