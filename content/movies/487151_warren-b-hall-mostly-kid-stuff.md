Daring to be different Warren chooses to focus on funny!  \u00a0  Warren has been seen on the shows \u201cLaughs\u201d as well as\u00a0\u201cComics Unleashed\"\u00a0 and he can be heard regularly on Pandora, Spotify and Sirius XM radio.  \u00a0  Warren has gone overseas and performed for our troops stationed in Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan..not once or twice but FIVE times. His style is original, relatable and definitely funny!  \u00a0  Don't take our word for it, see some of the funny for yourself!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
