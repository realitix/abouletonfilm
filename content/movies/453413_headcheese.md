{"tmdb_id": 453413, "title": "Headcheese", "original_title": "Headcheese", "slug_title": "headcheese", "date": "2001-01-01", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "Shot on 8MM &amp; 16MM black and white film stock and loosely based on Luke 8:29 in the New Testament, Headcheese is the gritty account of a deranged man\u2019s unholy psyche while on a bizarre pilgrimage to Quick Hill, Texas to rid his soul of feeble-minded parasites. Taking inspiration (as well as the original title) from the seminal 1974 movie Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Headcheese was filmed in and around locations of the famous horror film, featured as dilapidated ruins and vestiges of their former glory. Although not a horror film in the traditional sense, Headcheese follows a tortured killer\u2019s mental unravelings as he comes to grips with his inner demons, resulting in a hallucinatory short film that is as raw as it is bleak. With a pervasively harsh, noise-focused soundtrack to match the intense visual decay, Headcheese is a compelling, albeit experimental visual document of torment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A7ACmeyJL6XkxjG2YxfHbq2zHZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
