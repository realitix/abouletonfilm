Men who belonged to civic or veterans' clubs gathered together late at night while a roadshow operator would bring several hours worth of films and a 16mm projector. For a price, the audience would be treated to short films of gorgeous, naked women. These events were called 'stag parties.' This collection features a selection of what was shown at those parties, including entries from the popular series Hollywood Cuties and Key-Hole Peex. Some of them star pin-up girls Peggy Winters and Thelma Montgomery, who both appeared in the notorious exploitation feature Girl Gang (1954). All of them showcase the types of luscious ladies who made the average working man a little happier to go home to their wife that night!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
