Paul and Kathy seem to hit it off rather well but, during a meteor storm, a meteorite fragment strikes Paul, burying itself deep in his skull, which has the unpleasant side-effect of causing Paul to mutate into a giant reptilian monster at night and go on murderous rampages. It turns out that this sort of thing has happened before, when Professor Salina rediscovers ancient Native American paintings detailing a similar event many centuries ago. Kathy, however, still loves Paul, and tries to save him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z2BqIzbzpbdSAuECVSDgwqtYpmc.jpg", "actors": ["Chase Cordell (Paul G.
