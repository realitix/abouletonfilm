A place with a history of violent deaths going back seventy years or more, before the school was even built. For a class project, they filmed the school to find evidence of the paranormal. To hunt for ghosts. They found what they were looking for. And now the school in the woods is going to teach them a lesson in fear.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s1Ff74inQizq55xfBShqg5G5gRz.jpg", "actors": ["Joseph Blackstone (Freddie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Fhiz_EBemIs"}
