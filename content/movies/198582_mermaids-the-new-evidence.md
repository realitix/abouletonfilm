One piece of evidence alludes that P.T. Barnum had acquired an authentic living mermaid (different from his Fiji mermaid) but was unable to showcase it to the world. The last video is that of Danish marine geologists who videoed the creatures off the Greenland sea in March 2013. In response to this video Greenland halts all oil drilling in their territories.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/46OhAJSjd8Tb5wXT97CaEQRPM94.jpg", "actors": ["Ronald Scott Maestri ()", "James Cotter (Ship's Captain)", "Ronald Scott Maestri (Barrett Grant)", "David Evans (Dr. Paul Robertson)", "Jon Frankel (Host)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [117124], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
