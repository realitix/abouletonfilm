Its prosperity is contributed by Om, a big, tough, and due to some mushrooms, an overgrown leader boy who has his trusted entourages in Jon, Aun and Piek. One day, Om unexpectedly meets a pretty high school girl and suddenly falls in love with her. He then tries to win her heart with the help of his followers by disguising as a high school boy. While Om is in love and lacks the ability to rule, the stability of the gang is now wobbled; a new enemy arrives, new problems keep happening in the gang, and the love affair is complicated. To save the gang and to win the heart of the girl, Om must fight to conquer all the obstacles. It's time for the kids' epic of love and wit to begin, with a lot of laughs and fun.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kjBJiUS0Lrg5A6boJD0v1oPctp6.jpg", "actors": ["Keerati Mahapreukpong (Om)", "Nopparit Suriwong (Ohm)", "Katnatani Yasirohtwatana (Jamnien)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "WZ3zu9PAHR0"}
