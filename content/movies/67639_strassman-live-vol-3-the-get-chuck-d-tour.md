Filmed live in Melbourne, Australia! Darker and more twisted than ever before, the \"Get Chuck'd\" tour takes us to the edge of comic madness, exploring dysfunctional relationships with the wildest cast imaginable. Chuck Wood is back - in full force! - as the foul-mouthed, argumentative dummy. He's got a surprise for Strassman - he's having an affair with another ventriloquist, the Great Ventrini, and he's about to walk. The soft and cuddly Ted E. Bare, as anxious as ever, retreats into his fantasy world. Of course, all your favorite characters are back: Kevin the Alien, senile Grandpa Fred and the hack comic Sid the Beaver. Sharing the stage with A.N.G.E.L, his first ever female character, Strassman brings them to life with hilarious and spooky reality. Get ready for a super-charged comedy event! Sit back, relax and enjoy \"Strassman Live\" VOL 3, the \"Get Chuck'd\" Tour!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o7jLk9ehGsnvm7HL67jSbLZgfPX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
