But that wasn't the end of the story. \"The U Part 2\" picks up where the original film left off, with the program trying to recover from the devastation left by NCAA sanctions and scandals that had some calling for the school to drop football. The Hurricanes rose from those ashes to win another national championship, only to face new controversies when a booster used a Ponzi scheme to win favor with the program.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rkMp8i4yenFRlP4oKrb5Fagzfk2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
