The story of a stubborn journalist who undertakes the clarification and bringing to justice of the heinous murder of one student forty years later represents a dedicated effort to force a country from denial to reconciliation and closure of tragic social and political events in a country\u00b4s history. A nation cannot allow official cover-ups that seek to delete and erase from the collective memory events that prevent a nation\u00b4s march towards social justice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dn2onCcjNaklS4e28R1TxtdufcX.jpg", "actors": ["Adalberto Parra (Germ\u00e1n Acosta)", "Diana Garc\u00eda (Diana In\u00e9s)", "Gabriel Retes (Moto Adulto)", "Eugenio Cobo (Alfredo)", "Columba Dom\u00ednguez (Mam\u00e1 de Roberto)", "Patricia Garza (Licha Joven)", "Dunia Sald\u00edvar (Licha Adulta)", "Emanuel Orenday (Zurdo)", "Jorge Luke (Armando Megido)", "Rodrigo Virago (Roberto Renter\u00eda)", "Ren\u00e9 Campero (Hermes Z\u00fa\u00f1iga de Dios)", "Alan Alarc\u00f3n (Moto)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
