The haunting and otherwordly film set to an original score features small every day acts of refusal, resistance, and existence\u2014such as performance and self expression\u2014that have a tremendous impact on the world. The film reveals how the historical and systemic violence, like the killing and policing of black queer and trans life, continue to haunt our contemporary landscapes and is inextricably linked to the ongoing AIDS epidemic and the black queer/trans spaces shaped so intimately by HIV/AIDS, including the spaces where we come together and make life together: public spaces and nightlife spaces.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yASRIqUBAmrSfU7QH8ogPOBa6PU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
