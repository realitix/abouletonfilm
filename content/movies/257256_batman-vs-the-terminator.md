Iron demons now roam the planet, and without the requirement to defend the innocent against crime and injustice, Wayne has seeked refuge in the bomb shelter that saved his life; the Batcave.  Having scavenged the wasteland for resources, he discovers the radio of a dead soldier. There is static over a frequency. Flesh and blood is rising up to the west. With The Stinger; a riot control vehicular unit built before the apocalypse along with a refitted bomb blast vest, Batman makes his way across what remains of the United States to join forces with the man determined to neutralize the electronic menace - John Conner.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4cwg5spYeQXw2zQSZCRJGoz38e8.jpg", "actors": ["Mitchell Hammond (Batman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "gDYyAAdtDfk"}
