Needless to say, from the first shot, Clarke is on the trail: Steadicam shots of Christine walking take up the majority of screen time, with the journeys culminating in affectless shoot-ups in empty homes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qQYpRXKAQzqUqM8X0GPfVeR94PM.jpg", "actors": ["Vicky Murdock (Christine)", "Kelly George (Eddie)", "Mark Harvey (Ben)", "Joanne Mapp (Jessie)", "Anthony Smith (Eric)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
