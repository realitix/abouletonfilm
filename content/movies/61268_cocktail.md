She hires Paul; Stella, a part-time employee who's a college student in psychology, trains him. He has a gift for mixing the perfect drink to fit each customer's emotional needs. His own emotions, however, are complex: his father, an alcoholic, has died recently; he's abandoned his studies; and, although he's likes Stella, he's a tyro with women and inarticulate with her. Is alcohol the key to happiness, as Paul wonders; does it simply change peoples' personality, as Stella thinks; or, is it just there, as Candy's business sense tells her? Can Paul and Stella blend into something smooth?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8BOK0EvNT29NOQSChjNpXdTvbXN.jpg", "actors": ["Bobo Chan (Macy)", "Suet-Fei Chiu (Yuki)", "Endy Chow (Paul)", "Eric Kot (Tong)", "Johnson Lee Sze-Chit (John)", "Anson Leung (Yat)", "Wai-On Peng (Eddie Peng)", "Ellis Tang (Hong)", "Patrick Tang (Kin-wang Tang)", "Derek Tsang (Kuen)", "Monnie Tung (Fei)", "Race Wong (Stella)", "Lawrence Cheng (Tsuen)", "Candy Lo (Candy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
