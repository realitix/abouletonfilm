With Rodgers and drummer Simon Kirke from the original outfit and guitarist David \"Bucket\" Colwell, now a member of more than 10 years' standing, they're supremely tight, running through a succession of hits like \"Can't Get Enough,\" \"Feel Like Makin' Love,\" \"Burnin' Sky,\" \"Rock and Roll Fantasy,\" and Free's immortal \"All Right Now.\" Mostly, the songs are well-honed and urgent, free from indulgent solos, but Rodgers--whose voice has always been Bad Company's main attraction--leaves too many choruses to the crowd.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nrfgKeo52nqDkXDBslthp5PtVm0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
