While her husband Mak is away, Nak goes into labor and dies in their country home. At the funeral, a black cat jumps on the coffin, it breaks and Nak miraculously comes back to life. During the day she appears normal but at night she transforms into a rotten corpse. The ghostly wife serves her husband rotten, wormy food and eventually goes on a rampage. There's also comic relief. This is a remake of movie shot in 1973 under the same title.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iCkoGwaol8tN4EIW7Vmcq01yl0E.jpg", "actors": ["Bin Banleurit ()", "Chutima Naiyana ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
