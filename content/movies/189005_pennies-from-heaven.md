The family turns out to be a young girl, Patsy Smith, and her elderly grandfather who need lots of help. This delays Larry from following his dream and going to Venice and becoming a gondolier. Instead he becomes a street singer and, while singing in the street, meets a pretty welfare worker, Susan Sprague. She takes a dim view of Patsy's welfare under the guardianship of Larry and her grandfather, and starts proceedings to have Patsy placed in an orphanage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zAADEDxcQVRxfvli3e9vrdFaKx6.jpg", "actors": ["Bing Crosby (Larry Poole)", "Madge Evans (Susan Sprague)", "Edith Fellows (Patsy Smith)", "Louis Armstrong (Henry)", "Donald Meek (Gramp Smith)", "John Gallaudet (J.
