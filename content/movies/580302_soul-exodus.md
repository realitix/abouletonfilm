Five 21st century young and not so young men someplace in the world. They are musicians in search for someone and something which might have been born in their imagination. Once upon a time in the beginning of the 20th century there lived a Klezmer musician and storyteller Prince Nazaroff. Many people don\u2019t believe he ever existed, but these five do. They have imagined him, and imagination can be stronger than reality. To this day, Nazaroff lives in them. They can\u2019t except that something could disappear forever. They call themselves \u2018The Brothers Nazaroff\u2019.  A deeply emotional story told through Klezmer music about identity, emigration, inner emigration, brothers and godbrothers, religion and belief, faith and disbelief.  A modern story about our strange world we live in.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n7bPs4uSg92CDvUPmAmoWc4VSPy.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Alpert (Himself)", "Daniel Kahn (Himself)", "Psoy Korolenko (Himself)", "Jake Shulman-Ment (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
