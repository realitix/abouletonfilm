A 55-minute version premiered at the 2001 Edinburgh Film Festival alongside a new theatrical print of Medium Cool and with Wexler in attendance, and was broadcast on the BBC, PBS and the Sundance Channel. A version of the film appears on the 2013 Criterion Collection DVD release of Medium Cool.  The documentary, which has become more an educational project than anything else and remains a work-in-progress, was expanded in 2015 and now runs approximately six and half hours (in six parts).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dlbaQqMUWaFNpZwD3ZXCbHxRlhD.jpg", "actors": ["Haskell Wexler ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
