Director Lynne Sachs creates a film on the violence of the Middle East by exchanging letters with an Israeli friend. Together, they reveal Revital's story through her films, news reports, and interviews, culminating in heartbreaking footage of children discussing the violence they've witnessed. Without taking sides or casting blame, the film becomes a cine-essay on fear and filmmaking, tragedy and transformation, violence and the land of Israel/Palestine.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3CEx6YxsuIK8GqVdfoiitTaFOMH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
