This (somewhat) off beat look at high school via a tongue-tied underachiever who is head hunted for the school debate team is more like \"The Orator's Progress.\" (But accuracy won't/didn't sell the movie.)\r\n\r\nAll in all, a better-than-average teen movie, but nowhere near \"The King's Speech,\" which grandly promenaded into History on a similar subject. 3/10"}], "recommandations_id": [9685, 22152, 1550, 9786]}
