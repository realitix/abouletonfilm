Her arrival is met with skepticism and an attack by an aspiring rapist. She shoots the man in self defense and begins to form the sailors into a cohesive fighting unit. Joining the unit for a mission, the sailors are all murdered before they can convert to communism. The fallen angel is held up as a symbolic heroine to the people's cause in this decidedly propaganda-drenched film. The film took a specially created prize at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival, somewhat to the consternation of critics who failed to observe its merits.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lXcQCpoqWfWaVRXWJw7MeeCnxAf.jpg", "actors": ["Margarita Volodina (Commissar)", "Boris Andreyev (Vozhak)", "Vyacheslav Tikhonov (Aleksey)", "Erast Garin (Vozhachok)", "Oleg Strizhenov (First officer)", "Gleb Strizhenov (Second officer)", "Gennadiy Sergeev (Ryaboy)", "Ivan Zhevago (Boatswain)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [199253, 71024, 198816, 46708], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
