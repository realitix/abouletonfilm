That's the question Red Numbers asks. The story revolves around a guy who, according to a Fengshui master, only has three lucky minutes in his miserable life. His fortune is wrapped up with a greedy family whose grandfather - dead or alive, nobody knows for sure, holds the key to the winning combination in the 4D lottery. Three minutes, four numbers, a lot of money - or maybe not.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uzL28nlYRwS01k7V2G3BwT1mVg8.jpg", "actors": ["Edmund Chen (Lolipop)", "Hong Huifang (No 3 Mummy)", "Chen Shucheng ()", "Henry Thia (Fei Zai)", "Eunice Olsen (No 8 Mummy)", "Zhang Lu Bin (Xu Xiao Xu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "jKRPUpM4phc"}
