In February 1942, inking, painting and technicolor photography were completed for \"Clair de Lune\" as a short subject, but it was not released. In 1946 it was edited , reshaped and re-scored as the popular music sequence \"Blue Bayou\" in \"Make Mine Music\".  Previous attempts to recreate \"Clair de Lune\" were frustrated by missing animation and Stokowski footage. A nitrate workprint of the original version located in 1992 has allowed \"Clair de Lune\" to be completely reconstructed as Walt Disney intended it to be seen.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
