She is respected and feared by her employees. Only one thing is too short in her life: for years she had no sex and no husband by her side. At the company, she wants to show that she can also party properly. The next morning, she wakes up in a hotel bed with two employees next to her: the hated opponent Simon (Bert Tischendorf) and the \"footman\" Gregor (R\u00fcdiger Klink). With the aid of her assistant Achim (Maximilian Grill), she has lost all the memories of the previous evening. Her employees are forcing her to silence. Four months later, she realizes that she is pregnant and one of her nightmares is the father.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ccwjnnOD5bjuwLvpxzmA4ehJSW6.jpg", "actors": ["Nadja Becker (Kerstin Lackner)", "R\u00fcdiger Klink (Georg Kiefer)", "Maximilian Grill (Achim Herzberg)", "Christine Sommer (Johanna Klitter)", "Grischa Huber (Rita Lackner)", "Otto Mellies (Riemk\u00f6tter)", "Bert Tischendorf (Simon Schnell)", "Thomas Bading (Dietmar L\u00fchrig)", "Barbara Freier (Lore)", "Anja Karmanski (Dr.Kleine)", "Patrizia Moresco (Direktorin)", "Laura Osswald (Chantal)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
