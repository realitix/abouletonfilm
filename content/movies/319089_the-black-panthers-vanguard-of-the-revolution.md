Master documentarian Stanley Nelson goes straight to the source, weaving a treasure of rare archival footage with the voices of the people who were there: police, FBI informants, journalists, white supporters and detractors, and Black Panthers who remained loyal to the party and those who left it. An essential history, The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution, is a vibrant, human, living and breathing chronicle of this pivotal movement that birthed a new revolutionary culture in America.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kMB0ixGvTAVKuvQVkq6mW4ELBIZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [407897, 423710, 199617, 381019], "youtube_key": "F56O3kZ9qr0"}
