It's fun and easy as you read the on-screen lyrics and join the festivities. Invite your friends -- after all, it's even more fun when you share! Children as young as two will have a ball when Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy -- and other favorite Disney friends -- throw a party inside Disneyland's Haunted Mansion! There's plenty to do: pumpkin carving, bobbing for apples, cooking with Goofy -- even trick-or-treating in Toontown! But most of all, there'll be lots of singing and dancing to silly spooky songs of the season. So c'mon everybody, time to party!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hi8TIHiGFGqkZl9jg9yimySm1C6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
