Afterwards, he ties up and tortures them in various ways before killing them. Bill believes that if they die, they will be reincarnated and have a better life. He murders over a dozen people. One day, a young woman named Jade comes to stay with Bill's family. He falls in love with her but is afraid that he will kill her, so he makes her leave. Jade has nowhere to go and starts working as a prostitute. When Bill finds Jade doing this, he has sex with her and gets her pregnant.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2jzi9G1dPyLFzt6KSySbmvZ9I5K.jpg", "actors": ["Power Chan (Lau Shu Biu)", "Strawberry Yeung (Jade Fung Yuk Mooi)", "Farini Cheung (Mrs Lau)", "William Ho Ka-Kui (Li Qun)", "Timothy Zao (Jade's boyfriend)", "Amy Wong ()", "So B ()", "Chan Chi-Ming ()", "Lam Ching ()", "Tsang Yin (Laughing Red Guard)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
