One candidate is a staunch if not deluded conservative and the other is a radical liberal. Anticipating modern election campaigns by a good half a century, the two candidates decide that the best way to win is to sling as much mud as possible. Lacking the Internet and fifteen-second TV spots, they do the best they can -- they send each other virulent telegrams denouncing each other's personal failings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uXSLGcqiL2qUjyLWQ2En0GjRDPT.jpg", "actors": ["Grigore Vasiliu-Birlic (Costachel Gudurau)", "Costache Antoniu (Avocatul statului)", "Jules Cazaban (Iordachel Gudurau)", "Alexandru Giugaru (Procurarul)", "Nicky Atanasiu (Raul Grigorascu)", "Marcel Anghelescu (Popic)", "Nicolae Neam\u021bu-Ottonel (Primul ministru)", "Stefan Ciubotarasu (Cafegiul)", "Al Ionescu-Ghibericon ()", "Carmen Stanescu (Atenaisa Perjoiu)", "Alexandru Lungu ()", "Ovid Teodorescu (Albert Gudurau)", "Mircea Septilici (Ministrul Justitiei)", "Florin Vasiliu (Turturel)", "Horia \u0218erb\u0103nescu (\u015feful de cabinet al Primului ministru)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
