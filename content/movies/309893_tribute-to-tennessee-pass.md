When word spread that Union Pacific was closing the pass in 1997, interest climbed to an all-time high. Along with visitors from throughout the world, Pentrex traveled to this revered line to document its final months of operation. Our efforts were rewarded with a high volume of movements and an outstanding mix of trains. The grit of heavy-haul railroading is an awesome sight. Coal trains slug it out on the 3 percent grade leading to the 10,000-foot summit. Colorado's highest snow-capped mountains loom over toiling freights. Squealing flanges echo off canyon walls as trains grind through serpentine curves, and past the raging waters of the Arkansas River.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nQndJAh0pwEMJ5SObOUrnmveLKO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
