They travel deep into the woods far from any distractions the world provides. Here, the children are taught the ways of the Lord, the perils of the flesh, and the horror of the Devil. A charismatic priest leads them in their training. But, he unknowingly has brought something with him, something evil. What was supposed to be a safe place, a spiritual retreat has now turned into a nightmare that not even faith can end.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ovXBG2kSek6lac15D6LzavpxtWH.jpg", "actors": ["Jesse Eisenberg (Daniel)", "Spencer Treat Clark (Timothy)", "Joseph Vincent Cordaro (Ryan)", "Valentina de Angelis (Melissa)", "Gary DeMichele (Hobo)", "Will Denton (Tommy)", "Jaron Downs (Camp Brother)", "Christopher Denham (Christian)", "Bruce Davison (Fr.
