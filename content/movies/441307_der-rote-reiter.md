As \"red horseman\" he wants to support the socialist revolution and fight for the welfare of the working class. The journey towards the east turns out to be both a big adventure and a severe ethical test for the young man. He has to escape the German Armed Forces and ends up at a traveling circus where he falls in love with Fanny, a dressage rider. He overcomes the temptation to stay with her at the circus and - after briefly joining a gang of teenage thieves - he eventually boards a ship heading east. Aboard the ship he finds out that the seamen are transporting weapons for the hostile members of the White Army.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8JvYBGWkydL2TSjWeKla7LoPD1p.jpg", "actors": ["Burkhard Mann ()", "Gerhard Lau ()", "Klaus P\u00f6nitz ()", "Regina Popig-Heeger ()", "Ralph Borgwardt ()", "Marianne W\u00fcnscher ()", "Helmut Schreiber ()", "Horst Ziethen ()", "Juliane Kor\u00e9n ()", "Holger Mahlich ()", "Nico Turoff ()", "Siegfried Kellermann ()", "Ulrich Vo\u00df ()", "Gerd Micheel ()", "Zygmunt Mierzwiak ()", "Vera Oelschlegel ()", "Fritz Marquardt ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
