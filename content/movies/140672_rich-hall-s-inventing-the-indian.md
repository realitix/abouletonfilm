This image portrayed through cinema and literature is not a true representation of the Native American, giving Rich the opportunity to redress the balance.  With the help of Native American, Dallas Goldtooth, Rich explores a different idea of what the American Indian is and what life is like for them today. He not only questions the screen image of the 'savage Indian' in films such as Soldier Blue, Stagecoach and A Man Called Horse, but looks at the written one, through literature such as The Last of the Mohicans, Black Elk Speaks and Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eJ5TZWnmRBGdW3ULNV2gYJ23lOY.jpg", "actors": ["Rich Hall ()", "Dallas Goldtooth ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
