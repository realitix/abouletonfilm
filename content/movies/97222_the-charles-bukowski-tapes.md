Director Barbet Schroeder (Barfly) interviews Bukowski about such themes as alcohol, violence, and women, and Bukowski answers willingly, losing himself in sometimes minute-long monologues. Amongst other things, Bukowski leads the small camera team through his parents\u2019 house and his former neighbourhood, but the largest part of the interviews takes place in Bukowski\u2019s flat or backyard. The documentary includes a scene in which Bukowski reacts violently toward his wife Linda Lee.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yRuYywzb8zSWeceLDee2cEIvtlM.jpg", "actors": ["Charles Bukowski (Himself)", "Barbet Schroeder (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
