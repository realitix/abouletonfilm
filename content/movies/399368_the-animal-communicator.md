Anna Breytenbach has dedicated her life to what she calls interspecies communication. She sends detailed messages to animals through pictures and thoughts. She then receives messages of remarkable clarity back from the animals.  Anna can feel the scars hidden under a monkeys fur, she can understand the detailed story that is causing a birds trauma, she transforms a deadly snarling leopard into a relaxed content cat \u2013 the whole animal kingdom comes alive in a way never seen before \u2013 wild birds land on her shoulders, fish gather around her when she swims, and wild unfamiliar baboons lie on her body as if she is one of their own.  This is the first full length documentary film on the art of animal communication.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Anna Breytenbach (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
