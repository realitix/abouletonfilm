Zach will open that night for a British rocker at Whisky a Go-Go; he lives in a canyon and plays impromptu duets with a mysterious guitarist he doesn't see. Tammy is a costume designer, open to quick sex with the various rockers she works with and loved from afar by Michael, a photographer recovering from a case of the clap. His good friend is Felix, a morose, alcoholic songwriter. On hand for comic relief is Marty Shapiro, a fast-talking record producer. Getting ready for the gig at the club, Zach's performance, and the early-morning aftermath comprise the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ncThyoxoMl9XEoFgwJnJqburkfT.jpg", "actors": ["Anna Friel (Tammy Franklin)", "Nick Stahl (Zach)", "Rory Cochrane (Felix)", "Adam Goldberg (Marty Shapiro)", "Tommy Flanagan (Duncan)", "John Randolph (Mr. Niederhaus)", "Stephanie Romanov (Christine)", "Jared Leto (Glen Walker)", "Mary Lynn Rajskub (Eileen)", "Maurice Chasse (Nigel)", "Krista Allen (Jennifer)", "Matthew Frauman (Hobbit)", "Justin Ashforth (Joel)", "Justin Ashforth (Mary)", "Brian Gattas (Production Assistant)", "Judy Greer (Younger Waitress)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
