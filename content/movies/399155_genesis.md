It was installed at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia in 1991. A computer is swaddled in blankets in a small baby carriage. A text appears on the screen that tells the (true) story of a woman who miscarries and keeps the fetus in her refrigerator. The narration is artificial, generated by a speech synthesis program. This voice becomes more human as the story evolves and as our understanding of the power of naming sharpens.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m2aXMH5EO2E1NucCG88nrVbUY36.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
