The film asserts that environmentalists' opposition to the mine is unsympathetic to the needs and desires of the locals, prevents industrial progress, and consequently locks the people of the area into lives of poverty. The film claims that the majority of the people of the village support the mine, and the investment in their hometown. The film presents foreign environmentalists as alien agents opposed to progress, while residents are depicted as eagerly awaiting the new opportunity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/odHbb6ISCiP7hnQYOrpptqP3rl3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
