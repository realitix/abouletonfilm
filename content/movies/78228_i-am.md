After running away from an orphanage where he is treated as an outcast among outcasts by both his peers and the adults in charge, and being rejected a second time by his alcoholic mother, who had earlier abandoned him, the resolute 11-year-old finds a \"home\" on a deserted old barge on the outskirts of his hometown. He is still an outcast, but he is an outcast on his own terms, rejecting both patronizing charitable gestures and coercion by local thugs. In the process he makes one true friend, a girl from an affluent family who is also an outcast, despite living in material comfort.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tKbUfli2Zu3u6zxysLNBowvX1ik.jpg", "actors": ["Piotr Jagielski (Kundel)", "Agnieszka Nag\u00f3rzycka (Kuleczka)", "Edyta Jungowska (Kundel's Mother)", "Pawe\u0142 Wilczak (Kuleczka's Father)", "Barbara Szkaluba (Kuleczka's sister)", "Marcin Sztabi\u0144ski (Chudy)", "Lucjan Bienkowski (Stary)", "Agnieszka Podsiadlik (Waitress)", "Elzbieta Okupska (Cook)", "Janusz Chabior (Guy)", "Przemys\u0142aw Bluszcz (Policeman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [108574, 63984, 241220, 225255], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
