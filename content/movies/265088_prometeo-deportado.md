The 'members of the European Union' passby migration, while the 'others', in the other line, wait. In the middle of the claims, a group of ecuadorians is arrested. They are taken to the Room, where they wait to be deported. Seems like everyone hides something, like PROMETEO the youn magician with his hands tied like a delinquent who has a 'magical' trunk as luggage. Time passes, a way of being, Ecuador happens in this waiting room. Seems like there is no possible exit. Meanwhile, a different but well-known way of life takes place. The only thing left as a promising way out is illusion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/987JyMgngTYVr8qkVQX0VTUw6mH.jpg", "actors": ["Alejandro Fajardo (Nadador)", "Peki Andino (Escritor)", "Carlos Gallegos (Prometeo)", "Penelope Lauret (Nelly)", "Andr\u00e9s Crespo (Angel)", "Ximena Mieles (Afrodita)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
