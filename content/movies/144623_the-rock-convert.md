As a result, Xantus was able to record the startling transition. Pajor had been a hell-bent rocker, heavily into drugs, and known for a violent temper. We see him become a clean-living, clean-cut youth who sings about Jesus. Xantus had captured pre-conversion tape of Pajor trashing a hotel room and punching his hand through a plate glass window. In one of this film's most effective scenes, the new Pajor, hand heavily bandaged, quietly watches this footage. Rock Terito also has some dramatic recreations, but these add little to our understanding of Pajor. The transfer from video to film was generally effective, but some scenes are murkily lit. ~ Clarke Fountain, Rovi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c3JbH9IOkyunML8ZG3McKWbvS2N.jpg", "actors": ["L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Bolyki (Bej)", "Tam\u00e1s Pajor (Himself)", "J\u00f3zsef Borb\u00e9ly ()", "Zsolt De\u00e1k (Juanito)", "Tibor D\u00f3ka (Incognito)", "Sarah Fruct (Delphine)", "J\u00e1nos G\u00e9mes (M\u00e1gus)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
