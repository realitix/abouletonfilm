Teen detective Ruby Skye can't believe it. But how else do you explain the creepy shadows, the late-night noises, and the flying books!? As Ruby starts her investigation, a second mystery drops into her lap. Ava O'Deary - the owner of the library - dies and her Last Will and Testament is missing. Before you say \"long lost relative\", O'Deary descendants descend with plans to squander Ava's fortune, burn the books and turn the historic library into condos. Ruby can't let that happen. Ruby soon finds herself in a battle of wits with a ghost and a race against time to find Ava's will and save the library.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5xOnSD2DNJE2D89F07KxLzpSZw3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
