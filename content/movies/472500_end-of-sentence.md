As Sean steps out of prison the last thing on his mind is a foreign road trip with his alienated father. What he needs is a fresh start in California. But when his travel plans collapse he reluctantly accepts his father's proposal in return for a ticket to the West Coast and a promise that they never have to see each other again. Between a disconcerting Irish wake, the surfacing of an old flame, the pick up of a pretty hitchhiker and plenty of unresolved issues, the journey becomes a little more than father and son had bargained for.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["John Hawkes (Frank Fogle)", "Logan Lerman (Sean Fogle)", "Sarah Bolger (Jewel)", "\u00d3lafur Darri \u00d3lafsson (Stone)", "Sean Mahon (Andrew)", "Amy De Bhr\u00fan (Air Steward)", "David Grant Wright (Mr. Modine)", "Sean Duggan (Guard)", "Claire Mullan ()", "Shaw Jones (Stringer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
