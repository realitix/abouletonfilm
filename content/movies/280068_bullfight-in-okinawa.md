Part of Markers five-film \u201cBestiary\u201d series, Bullfight employs observational documentary techniques and, in particular, Marker\u2019s camerawork is impressive \u2014 tight framed shots, free-hand pans, and quick zooms all contribute to the film\u2019s urgent sense of tension \u2014 and, if it weren\u2019t for the suspense inducing music, this short-gem would be damn close to pure objective documentary cinema.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2itXsUFq3y8PLojc8nwjqtXatGX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
