With a producer who stole money from his mother's retirement account to fund the film, to a director who thinks she's the next Francois Truffaut, to an actor/editor who is a doormat for everyone, this motley crew of misfit filmmakers have a tough time navigating the chaotic world of the Sundance Film Festival. Ignorance, foolishness and above all ego drive the team to implosion as they struggle to realize their filmmaking dreams.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pezZmjcviPwPHLMmcrvY3lKAnt5.jpg", "actors": ["Sonja O'Hara (Julia)", "Rob Alicea (Johnny)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
