The videos are a result of Stark being inspired by the visual pleasure of watching her cats and the way their movement changed her perception of her domestic surroundings. By utilizing the soundtrack of one diegetic song per video, the life of the domestic cat - which usually involves no plans or action - is framed, and then elevated as a work of art. The videos, produced pre-Youtube in 1999-2002, predict our current extensive consumption and emotional responses to online cat videos, and unintentionally explore the rise of rapid attention span as a response to current technologies.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
