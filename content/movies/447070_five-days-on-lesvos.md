On the frontline is the Greek island of Lesvos \u2013 the first point of entry into Europe for over half of the refugees. One week at the end of August 2015 marked a tipping point in the crisis. More refugees arrived than ever before, volunteers were inundated and local infrastructure just couldn\u2019t cope; trains were overflowing, refugees were dying in the back of lorries and on beaches, and politicians responded by closing borders and arguing about how to stem the tide of people. Filmed over just five days, this first-hand account of that dramatic week on Lesvos is seen through the eyes of the refugees and volunteers caught in the crisis.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kkpWQFGsWyvur1Nv1eqemDYc1MK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "MVss6uvKce4"}
