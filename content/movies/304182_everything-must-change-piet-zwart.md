Piet Zwart worked as an interior and industrial designer, commercial typographer, photographer, critic and lecturer, playing a key role in defining the design climate in the Netherlands in the Twentieth Century. He is especially known for designing the famous \u2018Piet Zwart\u2019 kitchen for the Dutch company Bruynzeel: a kitchen that could be easily produced and consisted of standardized elements. His versatility and influence on present-day designers led the Association of Dutch Designers to award him the title of \u201cDesigner of the Century\u201d in 2000.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aelcyLlWw39ML3HgM6J3af4rmfV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
