From the moment a regiment of Georgians are stationed on the island, Marie\u2019s life changes and flourishes. With their film, music, and especially with their inventive, unusual survival strategies and entirely different life style, this isolated group of outsiders and in particular the young soldier Goga opens a new way for Marie.
