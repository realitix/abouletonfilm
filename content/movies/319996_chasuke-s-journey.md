Dozens of scribes sit before a long scroll incessantly scribbling away. They are composing the biographies of earth-dwellers. What is invented by the men in heaven is lived out below. And their employer, God, is increasingly vehement in demanding avant-garde ideas. Take, for example, the beautiful Yuri, a girl who dies in a car crash. Some of the heavenly scribes find this very dull and send former gangster Chas, who has become a heavenly tea-boy, back down to earth with instructions to save Yuri no matter what. And so Chas ends up in Okinawa, gets to know the earth-dwellers, interferes in their fates, becomes celebrated as 'Mr Angel' and is hounded by brutal enemies. His falling in love with Yuri is of course a foregone conclusion. But no one could anticipate what happens next. Not even God himself", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/esOWzjp00UJR5aY7SUYUmuXbs8K.jpg", "actors": ["Kenichi Matsuyama (Chasuke)", "Ito Ohno (Yuri)", "Ren Osugi (Taneda)", "Yusuke Iseya (Hikomura)", "Susumu Terajima (Kuroki)", "Hiromasa Taguchi ()", "Tina Tamashiro (Chako Saotome)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [342185], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
