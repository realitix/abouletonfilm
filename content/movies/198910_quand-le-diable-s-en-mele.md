(Miroslav Hornicek) is a deluded young man who is convinced he is Faust incarnate. This turn of mind leads to some ludicrous situations, such as when he believes a woman is really a cat. Before he can be rounded up and interned wherever they keep people with this type of a problem, love enters his life and the clouds that obscured his vision begin to dissipate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e8eqfep33aQQzBNK4MMa3H68IgQ.jpg", "actors": ["Miroslav Horn\u00ed\u010dek ()", "Jana Hlav\u00e1\u010dov\u00e1 ()", "Rudolf Hru\u0161\u00ednsk\u00fd ()", "Vlastimil Brodsk\u00fd ()", "Ji\u0159\u00ed Sov\u00e1k ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
