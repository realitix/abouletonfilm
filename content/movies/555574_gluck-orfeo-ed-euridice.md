His singing has the power to appease the Furies and animate the blessed Shadows. Yet, his voice cannot reassure Eurydice who despairs of the feigned indifference of Orpheus, put to the test by Jupiter. Rapha\u00ebl Pichon conducts the opera of operas and Aur\u00e9lien Bory displays the giddiness of the mental and supernatural spaces traveled by Orpheus and beyond.
