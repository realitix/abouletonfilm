He found a local black orderly singing in the hospital. The man singing was Percy Sledge, the band became known as The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, also known as The Swampers. The funk and groove that these boys laid down became the stuff of legend.  This is their story.\r\n\r\nWilson Picket called his label and said - \"Get me those black boys to play on my record.\" His label told him - prepared to be disappointed. It's a bunch of country white boys in Alabama. He came down anyway and so did everyone else. Aretha Franklin, Rolling Stones, Bobby Gentry, Mac Davis, Jerry Reed, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Paul Simon - the list goes on and is utterly amazing.\r\n\r\nThe film tells us the unvarnished story of the rise and fall of both Rick Hall and the studio.  You will be amazed at all the artists and songs that call Muscle Shoals home.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography of this film is ridiculously good.  The camera angles, soft touches, zooms, and locations are top-shelf filming.  Pay attention to all the chairs they use to tell the story. It's subtle but great story telling.\r\n\r\nGreat film and even better music."}], "recommandations_id": [291817, 172548, 103734, 278086]}
