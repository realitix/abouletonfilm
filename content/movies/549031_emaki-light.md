The film is collaboration work between filmmaker Makino Takashi and painter and filmmaker Ishida Takashi. Ishida has been  interested in live-picture, the process of paint, and Makino\u2019s interest is to make a new image with extremely high speed random images. With Makino\u2019s skills in telecine, Ishida\u2019s painted lines were rolled and scrolled, and became \u201cthe living line\u201d. The film is maybe a chance, or maybe it is a fight. Perhaps, this film will show you both elements.
