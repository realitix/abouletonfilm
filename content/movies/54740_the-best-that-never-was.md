On his way to eclipsing Herschel Walker\u2019s record for the most touchdowns in high school history, Dupree attracted recruiters from schools in every major conference to his hometown of Philadelphia, Miss. More than a decade removed from being a flashpoint in the civil-rights struggle, Philadelphia was once again thrust back into the national spotlight. Dupree took the attention in stride, and committed to Oklahoma. What followed, though, was a forgettable college career littered with conflict, injury and oversized expectations. Eight-time Emmy Award winner Jonathan Hock will examine why this star burned out so young and how he ultimately used football to redeem himself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jGGt9vYsKtQRXzDyhMXtc4h4hit.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [54688, 54742, 54685, 54737], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
