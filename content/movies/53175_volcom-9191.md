Ambitious and slightly off-beat, 9191 mashes stop-motion animations with out-of-this-world footage and combines it with a haunting soundtrack by Baron, famed for his work on Flip's Extremely Sorry film. If you're looking for a snowboard flick with more meat than potatoes, you've got your hands full with 9191.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8eJVUbSjGtIWQlPo3OorWoiRUu4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
