For the past 25 years they have provided us with some unforgettable programs that left us on the floor such as The Young Ones, The Dangerous Brothers and of course, Bottom. The DVD contains the very best and violent bits from the live shows and TV programmes that have starred the two slapstick legends in the past 25 years. With the help of the great comedy writers such as Ben Elton, they have produced many great moments, such as the sprouts of doom and the towering inferno impression that went horrifically wrong. Here they are, all of the great moments on 1 disc. Here is what you can expect from the greatest compilation of slapstick moments of all time!!!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j6Ve9HO4PSSQ6ZatdCLx4ShgdpB.jpg", "actors": ["Rik Mayall (Ritchard Ritchard)", "Adrian Edmondson (Eddie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
