The film examines evidence that ancient civilizations may have known of this celestial cycle and that our Sun may indeed display the characteristics of binary motion.  Just as the Earth\u2019s spin on its axis causes day and night and our planet\u2019s annual orbit around the Sun is responsible for the ongoing cycle of the seasons, what if there is some greater celestial cycle, lasting thousands of years, slowly influencing the rise and fall of civilization across the globe? Where is the evidence? What could be the cause?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zTKaBQaD9qgB1fMuuzQEsoc5feP.jpg", "actors": ["James Earl Jones (Narrator)", "Walter Cruttenden (Himself)", "John Anthony West (Himself)", "Uwe Homann (Himself)", "Werner D\u00e4ppen (Himself)", "Brother Achalananda (Himself)", "Ronald J.
