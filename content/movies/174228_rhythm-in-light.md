Grieg's \"Peer Gynt Suite\" accompanies images of common objects and abstract forms photographed in soft focus and through prisms: rings, pyramids, the staff of musical notes, and floating lights are all seen in multiple images, sometimes as if through a kaleidoscope, other times as if in animation. Images appear and patterns move across the screen. Sparklers celebrate at the film's end.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mjKkIEN1t81NVwMxxOnclm4NI8o.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [184519, 184522, 77851, 162612], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
