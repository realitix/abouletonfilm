The accolades and sales successes achieved by State Of the Art Of Computer Animation prompted the 1990 release of The Mind's Eye: A Computer Animation Odyssey, a title that would become the first member of the successful The Mind's Eye series. The next decade (1990\u20132000) would be taken up almost entirely with the production of 19 feature-length 3-D computer animated package films for home release.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fwLv4yathB8kYGlISaJXtCRmKOe.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
