He does not permit Ashoo to take their only son, Prakash, with her. Kumar spends all the rest of his free time bringing up Prakash, and hating his wife. Years later, Prakash has grown up, and is now employed with a business firm, whose owner is Mohan. Prakash meets with Mohan's beautiful sister, Kiran, and falls in love with her. Kiran too is attracted to Prakash.
