Leon, the con-artist makes his living cheating Catholic bingo players by hosting bogus religious pilgrimages. He is involved with a woman, but that doesn't stop him from getting involved with the frustrated Sophie who hates living in a tiny apartment with her lazy husband, her ever-gloomy teenage daughter and her husband's demanding, self-centered father, Emile. Sophie is so desperate to escape and start a new life that she convinces Leon to help her kill Emile who allegedly has $150,000 tucked away. The murder is to occur during one of Leon's pilgrimages. He convinces his son Paolo, an ex-con, to assist. Despite their careful planning, nothing prepares the would-be killers for the surprising result.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5yfhC93UvZDJLKX33haT8NeTL4J.jpg", "actors": ["Marcel Sabourin ()", "Micheline Lanct\u00f4t ()", "Paul H\u00e9bert ()", "Luc Proulx ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
