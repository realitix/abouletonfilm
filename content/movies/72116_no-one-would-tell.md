At first she is flattered by his constant attention, but then he becomes possessive and jealous-telling her who she can speak to and what she can wear. Threats escalate into violence when Bobby thinks Stacy has stepped out of line. Soon she is walking on egg shells and living in fear. Having seen the tell-tale bruises, Stacy's best friend convinces her to break things off with Bobby-but in a moment of weakness, Stacy goes to meet him. It will be the last time she is seen alive.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k8SJ6OfE2TaNYon89RICKkk37Md.jpg", "actors": ["Candace Cameron Bure (Stacy Collins)", "Fred Savage (Bobby Tennison)", "Gregory Alan Williams (Detective Anderson)", "Heather McComb (Nicki)", "Sally Jessy Raphael (Judge)", "Rodney Eastman (Tony Dinardo)", "Season Hubley (Rita Thompson)", "Michelle Phillips (Laura Collins)", "Gary Wolf (Neil)", "Justina Machado (Val Cho)", "Paul Linke (Rod Merredi)", "Eric Balfour (Vince Fortner)", "Paige Moss (Donna Fowler)", "Billy Joe Patton (Coach Murphy)", "Mark DeMichele (Prosecutor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [60662, 64191, 166433, 152545], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
