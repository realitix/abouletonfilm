This skillful v\u00e9rit\u00e9 portrait follows the unassuming Khoshjamal in the nine months leading up to the 2008 Beijing games. Living in an Islamic country, she is required to wear a hijab at all times and, unlike her fellow competitors around the world, cannot train with men; however, the power in her fighting resoundingly breaks down stereotypical barriers.  Khoshjamal\u2019s experience as a world-class athlete may be familiar, but captured here is the importance of the coach-athlete relationship. The bond she shares with her feisty and much-admired female coach is revealed through everyday moments as both struggle through inequality to make their mark\u2014in sport and society. Though it\u2019s still the male athletes who are ultimately celebrated in her country, Khoshjamal\u2019s accomplishments and lasting influence on scores of girls in Iran are undeniable.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w2yhk6Q1iGj85bDnxu5aitSzBLK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
