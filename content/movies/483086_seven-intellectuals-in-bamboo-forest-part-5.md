Ruan Ji, Ji Kang, Shan Tao, Liu Ling, Ruan Yan, Xiang Xiu and Wang Rong were famous poets and artists at that time. Open and unruly, they used to gather and drink in the bamboo forest, singing songs and playing traditional Chinese musical instruments, in the hope of escaping from earthly life. They pursued individuality, freedom, and liberty. Their remarkable talent and passion made them a notable group in Chinese history. Part 5 is about the return to the city and to reality. We live in the city and belong to it. If any problem arises, we are able to solve it.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Chen Ran ()", "Yanqin Gao ()", "Huang Lu ()", "Jing Xu ()", "Ni Keyun ()", "Li Shenghua ()", "Dai Zhe ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
