The artist addresses the fallibility of electronic transmission by emphasizing the distortion and absurdities that occur as a result of technical interference. Stressing the fact that there's never a straight story, Rosler asserts her presence in a character-genererated text that irolls over the manipulated images, isolating excerpts from her sources. In Rosler's barrage of media information, the formal structure is inseparable from her political analysis.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7njrfoUMQmreTHHfvjk2LVlcJsw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
