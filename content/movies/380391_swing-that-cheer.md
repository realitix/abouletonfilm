Undeniably talented on the gridiron, Bob Potter (Brown) is equally undeniably an arrogant pain in the posterior. So swell-headed does Potter become that he can never admit to himself that his blocking-back teammate Larry Royal (Robert Wilcox) is equally reponsible for Bob's success. To teach his pal a lesson, Larry feigns an injury and pulls out of the Big Game, forcing Bob to go it alone.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sk7urUXpJXgUHJEJBRDDU9lLzLL.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Brown (Bob Potter)", "Robert Wilcox (Larry Royal)", "Constance Moore (Marian Stuart)", "Andy Devine (Doc Saunders)", "Samuel S.
