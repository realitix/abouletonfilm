After their training, protected by bullet proof vests, shields and a gun, they are sent out on the streets. This documentary accompanies students at a German police academy over the course of their first year.  A remote location in Saxony-Anhalt. Real-life simulations and practice at the shooting range are the preparation for the second phase of their training - going out on the streets and facing the real world.  It's their first year at the academy and on the beat, and these young men and women are often confronted with realities that take them to their limits.  This documantary takes an uncensored look at the German police for the very first time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cF0VHkJobmqC3QTzVUsEibV6TkM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
