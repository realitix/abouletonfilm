It brought not only energetic concerts with slams and crashed guitars, but also ideas: of propaganda resistance, vegetarianism, abstinence from alcohol and drugs. But in 2012, the band was put on hold, and its frontman Sasha Chemerov moved to Los Angeles. Musicians got back together in the summer of 2017 and gave a series of powerful shows.  \u00abDymna Sumish: Between Hell and Heaven\u00bb is a movie about the comeback, friendship, and rock\u2019n\u2019roll. The film includes interviews with band members, concert footage from different periods and live performances, specially shot for the movie.  And although the band split up at the beginning of 2018, we believe that its story and legacy still matter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aSTck17477bkGhKRmIR3jaYjLiz.jpg", "actors": ["\u041e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0427\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432 (Himself)", "\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0456\u0439 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432 (Himself)", "\u0406\u0433\u043e\u0440 \u0413\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0430 (Himself)", "\u041e\u043b\u0435\u0433 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432 (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "XX8L5ITz-F0"}
