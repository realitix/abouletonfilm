He tells him a story about a day he was hunting there. The game hunter gets help from African natives to catch some animals, with some odd results. Sight gags include an elephant who can't remember something he was supposed to do, and the game hunter riding a elephant and having to \"shift gears\" like an automobile to get up a steep hill.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2sqXoRGreRYu4GsxmOupDwUKRiS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
