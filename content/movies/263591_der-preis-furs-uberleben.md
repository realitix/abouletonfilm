The setting is Jefferson City, Missouri, and Joseph Randolph (Martin West), a VIP in a fictional electronics company, has just gotten the sack. The company bigwigs insist it is simply because of downsizing, but Randolph is not buying it. Enraged, he gets a handgun (this is the U.S.) and shoots five managers to death. Then he turns himself in and is eventually put in a psychiatric hospital by the police. His family suffers a series of tragedies that leave only his daughter to wonder about why her father was committed to an institution. She joins with a visiting reporter from Chicago and another interested man, and all three start digging deeper into the company's history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oC66K4JtDHZzxgeEZJ8x4GwIt0I.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
