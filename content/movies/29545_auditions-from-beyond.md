While they generally do very well at these (Femalien 1 &amp; 2, Virtual Encounters), this particular entry seems to be just a rehash of old tape. Any number of girls -- some recognizable and others not -- are in this film in all stages of nudity. There are also several clips from other films which are outstanding, unless you've seen those other films. There are a number of solo nude scenes doing a number of things -- some playing basketball, others talking, still others playing with themselves. The only thing of value in this tape is the very last scene -- a short but erotic girl-girl scene with a very enthusiastic and enjoyable Sandy Wasko and a more subdued Tammie Hainum.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8Bnqect4lPvc4o2cONsrFuoSzrX.jpg", "actors": ["Nikki Fritz (-)", "Taimie Hannum (-)", "Ahmo Hight (-)", "Jacqueline Lovell (-)", "Zoe Paul (-)", "Stella Porter (-)", "Nenna Quiroz ((as Lisa Throw))", "Brinke Stevens (Narrator)", "Venesa Talor (-)", "Timber (-)", "Sandy Wasko (-)", "Mia Zottoli ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
