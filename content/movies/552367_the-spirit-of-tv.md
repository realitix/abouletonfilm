Viewing news broadcasts and videos of other Brazilian native peoples, the Wai\u00e3pi see the power of images to facilitate memory preservation and political awareness. Some people worry, though about the invasive spirits of outsiders that can come through the TV. Another concern is the negative exposure that might result from the Wai\u00e3pi broadcasting their own images.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3oZidrYS4aYap68xNXubtMnHjMz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
