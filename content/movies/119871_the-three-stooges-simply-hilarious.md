In \"Disorder in the Court\", they raise havoc when they come to testify at a murder trial, while Shemp is a \"Brideless Groom\" who stands to inherit half a million dollars--but only if he marries within forty-eight hours. \"Malice in the Palace\" follows their comic misadventures as they search for a diamond, and they are comically inept tailors who inadvertently aid a robber on the run from the law in \"Sing a Song of Six Pants.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/41pDY53F4txFkNc53KGJGUlr8jC.jpg", "actors": ["Moe Howard (Moe)", "Larry Fine (Larry)", "Curly Howard (Curly)", "Shemp Howard (Shemp)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
