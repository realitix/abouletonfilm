With motion capture (MoCap) and particle processing, designers Denis Poulin and Martine \u00c9poque create virtual dancers free of their morphological appearance. In this balletic and hypnotic film, dynamic traces carry the motion of the real dancers behind the on-screen movements. Addressing environmental themes by way of metaphor, CODA is a fused universe where space and time collide, deploy, and dissolve. In this technically and formally innovative film, luminous bodies in the infinite space of the cosmos transform and evolve to the rhythms of Stravinsky\u2019s Rite of Spring.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kUaAJWC8VuvBD6MgMIFKqXWlw8L.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
