Pinto elliptically and delicately portrays the small farming community that serves as the backdrop for the impossible relationships pursued by Laura and her brother, Nuno. The alluring cast also features In\u00eas de Medeiros (of Jacques Rivette\u2019s The Gang of Four and several films by Pedro Costa) as Gra\u00e7a, a key player in the film\u2019s game of libidinal cat-and-mouse. A strongly atmospheric work in which torrid intrigues emerge through allusion and insinuation, Where the Sun Beats finds Pinto exploring the self-thwarting ways of desire and the expressive potential of the unspoken. - FilmLinc", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c9R9CwKjQXX8mJdVsKvfjekbaH.jpg", "actors": ["Lu\u00eds Miguel Cintra (Artur (voice))", "In\u00eas de Medeiros (Gra\u00e7a)", "Maria de Medeiros (Laura (voice))", "Ant\u00f3nio Pedro Figueiredo (Nuno)", "Manuel Lob\u00e3o (Francisco)", "Laura Morante (Laura)", "Francisco Nascimento (Z\u00e9)", "Maria Ortega (Teacher)", "Ant\u00f3nio Ricardo (Alberto (voice))", "Arnaldo Saraiva (Mr. Saraiva)", "Marcello Urgeghe (Alberto)", "Joaquim Vicente (Artur)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
