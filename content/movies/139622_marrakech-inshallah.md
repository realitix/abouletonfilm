After making their way to Marrakech, they encounter the endless drone of the city, congested traffic, snake charmers and even happen upon a Western film crew that wants to include them in their film. What does the future hold for these two brothers, with no jobs or prospects in a large city such as Marrakech?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gBtNMV5NsE4lWHi18JBLq493RqJ.jpg", "actors": ["Aziz Raddad ()", "Hammadi Raddad ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "h2QHC3gjHj4"}
