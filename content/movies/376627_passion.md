They are snapshots of various situations and locations, as in this program of nine miniatures, shot in hotel rooms and parks, at the shore of a lake, and \u2013 in the longest contribution \u2013 on a restaurant terrace. Rousseau\u2019s observations of everyday life, however, are about precision rather than contemplation. With each minute that passes, they sharpen the view of the observant and expectant outsider for a moment of surprise \u2013 be it a jump into the water or a huge crucifix.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rlN5HHezVKmzUbyohe6bXbuV7UD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
