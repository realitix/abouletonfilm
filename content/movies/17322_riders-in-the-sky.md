Instead of romantic (nearly melodramatic) scenes, incorporated to the Sverak's \"Tmavomodry svet\" (Dark Blue World) it offers stories from ordinary, cruel life of Czech pilots in Great Britain. And it's even more deeper. The final scene with two soldiers - Czech and German, which are not enemies more, when the both men are facing their destiny in despair... Some of the most haunting moments includes also story of soldier, which received serious face injury and now must try to reconcile himself... The main storyline follows the story of two young Czech pilots - Student (falling to an unhappy romance with British radio-operator) and Prcek, both excellently acted (by remarkable talents Jiri Bednar and Jiri Hrzan).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wGw4vDpMCwF4AAAMEICECoOpS69.jpg", "actors": ["Ji\u0159\u00ed Bedn\u00e1\u0159 (Student)", "Ji\u0159\u00ed Hrz\u00e1n (Prcek)", "Svatopluk Maty\u00e1\u0161 (Pavel)", "Elsie Randolph (Nurse Henderson)", "Jana Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1 (Patricia)", "Joan Seton (Mrs. Watkinson)", "Charles Cameron (Bradley)", "Winston Chrislock (Tommy)", "Geoffrey Russell-Jones (Zpradovajec)", "Vojt\u011bch Hol\u00fd (George)", "Josef V\u00e1\u0161a (Frank)", "Victor Carter (Batchelor)", "Ivan Kraj\u00ed\u010dek (Mechanik)", "Jaroslav Rozs\u00edval (Mechanic)", "Karel H\u00e1la ()", "Jan Kaplick\u00fd ()", "Zlata Adamov\u00e1 ()", "Marie Cingro\u0161ov\u00e1 ()", "Jana Sedlmajerov\u00e1 ()", "Ivan Folt\u00fdn ()", "Jaroslav Toms ()", "Kazimierz Siedlaczek ()", "Milan Mor\u00e1vek ()", "Celest\u00fdn Mr\u00e1zek ()", "Zden\u011bk Novotn\u00fd ()", "Bed\u0159ich \u0160etena ()", "Otakar \u0160indel\u00e1\u0159 ()", "Jaroslav Vlk ()", "Anton\u00edn Kubov\u00fd ()", "Ladislav Bezubka ()", "Karel Kos ()", "V\u00e1clav Kr\u00e1l ()", "\u010cestm\u00edr Precl\u00edk ()", "Zden\u011bk \u0160ediv\u00fd ()", "Karel Hru\u0161ka ()", "Josef Chrastil ()", "Gunter Scho\u00df ()", "Old\u0159ich Unger ()", "Jaroslav Doktor ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
