The Cossacks attack the village and massacre almost everyone, and the young Katerina is whipped to death. Before escaping to England, her sister Darya swears to avenge her sister's death. Years later--now one of the world's most famous prima ballerinas--she returns to Russia. Turov falls in love with her and manages to secure a meeting. She coyly asks him to take her to see a prison first. As it turns out, what he has planned for her is nothing compared to what she has planned for him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qE0py60DhGdsrCk0QJUtQBIctrT.jpg", "actors": ["Viola Dana (Darya Orlinsky)", "Grace Williams ()", "Robert Walker ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
