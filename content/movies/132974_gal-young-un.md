Trax is a womanizing, lying bootlegger who needs money and he sets his sights on Mattie who can support him. After energetically courting her, Mattie marries Trax, who before long brings home a young woman to be their housekeeper, but it is obvious that she is to be his mistress. When Trax leaves on business, the two women each contemplate how they are being exploited and Mattie comes up with a plan of her own.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vOIzhRiFYVi3uPo0gvMa8NWZI4m.jpg", "actors": ["Dana Preu (Mattie Siles)", "David Peck (Trax)", "J.
