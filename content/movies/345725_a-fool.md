The hook here is Chen\u2019s amazing performance as the simple, slightly crude Latioazi, a goat farmer who has a son in jail. When a young mentally handicapped man follows him home one day and enters his life, it sets off a blaze and a chain of events follows, which bares China\u2019s class divide raw. His random act of reluctant kindness invites a parade of strangers and grifters all intent on draining Latioazi of what little he has.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i9Cfl8F9pMqZDCfyKAwlH80qmCQ.jpg", "actors": ["Jianjiang Chen ()", "\u738b\u5b66\u5175 ()", "Jin Shijia ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [355953, 283711, 345669, 287888], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
