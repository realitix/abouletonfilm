In this leisurely drama, set in 1950s Athens, Antonis Barkis (Kostas Kasakos) is the master puppeteer for a traditional shadow show. However, although he is still making a living, it is clear that other forms of popular entertainment will soon supplant this one. This does not improve Antonis' temper, and his assistant's desires to modernize their entertainments only make it worse.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hnGegZrFaJgmYIIUKg0FrfZQ62a.jpg", "actors": ["Kostas Kazakos ()", "Stratos Tzortzoglou ()", "Dora Masklavanou ()", "Giorgos Ninios ()", "Vlassis Bonatsos ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
