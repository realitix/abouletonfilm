But either way, it's bad.\r\n\r\nFor a decent Cusack/Jackson team up in a King adaptation, just watch 1408.\r\n\r\nFinal rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid if possible."}, {"pseudo": "John Chard", "content": "Brain Cell or Brain Drain?\r\n\r\nWell I haven't read the book but I like Stephen King, I like John Cusack and I like Samuel Jackson, so Cell seemed like a good choice for a late night cerebral chiller. How far off was I? As it happens, very!\r\n\r\nSuddenly cell phones are turning the populace into crazed homicidal maniacs, a small band of survivors try to stay alive and figure out what is going on...\r\n\r\nIt starts off promisingly, with whirls of chaotic violence and blood, but it then turns into a travelogue movie where everybody either looks bored or is clearly doing it for the money. There's some good ideas at work but the film never delivers on its promise, even serving up an ending that defies patience as well as logic. Being vague is a good thing if the pay off is worth the wait, unfortunately that isn't the case here. Epic fail and the actors and audience deserve better. 3/10"}], "recommandations_id": [290637, 257087, 284564, 340103], "youtube_key": "fmkfKcr5JPQ"}
