After leaving his high-pressured existence as a successful architect, the newly resolved dropout goes to live in a small community of cabins and summer homes in a lake-filled region north of Warsaw. His interactions with the villagers, including a drunkard and other eccentrics, provide an informative background for what happens next. The ex-architect's wife is a professional singer who has not abandoned the city or her life -- and she soon arrives to spend some time with her very changed husband.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6P39oO2vjxHOxoIuQmUwrsMAq13.jpg", "actors": ["Janusz Gajos (Janek)", "Tomasz Zaliwski (Wojtek)", "Iga Cembrzy\u0144ska (\u017cona Wojtka)", "Tadeusz Fijewski (dziadek Foton)", "Jan \u015awiderski (pastuch Teodor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
