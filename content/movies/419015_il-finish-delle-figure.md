That is, images intended as photography, and therefore as still images. My inclination is to animate [still images] at the very limit of technical impossibility. Scanning these rolls of figures in a state of agitation, shooting one frame at a time, I wanted to extract a film from what was not a film, where frames precisely do not exist and where the process of hand-cranking exposures was indeed equivalent to that of a movie camera, without, however, being a movie camera. Of interest to me was the collision among images dispossessed of sequence, to which the possibility of motion had been given, a motion towards a kinetic narrative, no longer a photographic one, which narrates the end of the images themselves.\" Paolo Gioli", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hPEmUWRk6K1IaAQbmc80gLpufMJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
