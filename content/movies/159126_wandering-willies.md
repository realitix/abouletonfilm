Desperate for some chow, they opt to impersonate a police officer and a baby, two types of diners most likely to get offered freebies. When that fails, they go to the food-chain source, posing as a cow. Yet more misadventures ensue before the duo finds itself chased by a latterday edition of producer Mack Sennett's Keystone Kops. Director Del Lord was a former Keystone Kop who helmed many of the Three Stooges' most beloved comedies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t1EF9QzM8HihvvRoiRtuAH8tc7e.jpg", "actors": ["Billy Bevan (Percy Nudge)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
