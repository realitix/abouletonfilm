His crime spurt is petty until one results in the killing of the night watchman at the college. Roma Anderson, secretary to the professor, is heads-over about Reynolds but he is more interested in a night club entertainer. Reynolds, keeping with the family-affair motif, meets a bad end while being pursued by an undercover agent who is his sister's boyfriend. Title refers to a roulette-wheel call. They did refrain from rolling an 8-ball across his path.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
