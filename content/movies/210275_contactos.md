Contactos (Contacts) is a film compendium taken from the productive singularities of a marginal cinema that confronted film models concerning Franco\u2019s dictatorship. Contactos was filmed without administrative intervention and control, and made under a high degree of secrecy, using 16mm film in black and white (The soundtrack was dubbed in after filming at a small Madrid sound studio), and without benefit of commercial distribution. - Javier Moral", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pkIWr3AibvpLnLIyg8sV8oyDhap.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
