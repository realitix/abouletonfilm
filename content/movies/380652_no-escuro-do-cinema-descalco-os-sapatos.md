This curious gaze spills over what is usually offscreen, giving back images of an exciting beauty not coming from impostation, but from a sharp camera that is not afraid to get out of focus while jumping from one body to another, and also from an editing that, in order to perpetuate the movement, does not elide empty frames. Finally, a sincere praise of dance that is born from formal courage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aqEU5SQd5yKGhcRprKM1Bf9xFCC.jpg", "actors": ["Miguel Ramalho ()", "Dukin Seo ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "GtPADZ-n5Jo"}
