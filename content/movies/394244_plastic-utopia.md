He's unpopular, whiny and cranky, not to mention a second-rate street mime fond of belittling his audience. James longs for a life or reckless abandon, much like that of his unscrupulous roommate Frank Feldspar - a thief, murderer, and a professional poet who is loved by all. James enthusiastically embraces the lifestyle of a hardened criminal, and he teams up with Frank for a daring armed robbery. *Notes from IMDB*", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wLnjMCKH9Pv4Qe4oPDegRXE0Oci.jpg", "actors": ["John Arkinson (Heckler)", "David Zellner (James)", "Nathan Zellner (Frank)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
