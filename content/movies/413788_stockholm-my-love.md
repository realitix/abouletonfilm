It follows one woman's footsteps through the streets of her native city, on a journey of recovery from a bad thing that happened to her exactly one year before. It's an exploration of grief, identity and the power of architecture and urbanism to shape lives, and a celebration of the power of walking and looking to make us all feel just a little bit better. With new music by Neneh Cherry, old music by Benny Andersson (of ABBA) and Franz Berwald, and images by Christopher Doyle and Mark Cousins.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ceVENAmHyfMtMyKtovHTZZvB0Ln.jpg", "actors": ["Neneh Cherry (Alva)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [417688, 503755, 510041, 414792], "youtube_key": "3bTV_N_jVEs"}
