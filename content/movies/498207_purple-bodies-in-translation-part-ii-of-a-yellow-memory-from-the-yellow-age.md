The video merely shows a color: purple, projected on a mirrored screen that allows the viewer to see their own reflection, to see themselves within the subtitled text. Lina Mounzer\u2019s essay \u2018War in Translation: Giving Voice to the Women of Syria\u2019 weaves the testimonies she is translating with her own personal experience of living through the civil war in Lebanon. Stefan Tarnowski\u2019s essay \u2018Subtitling a Film\u2019 describes the intricacies of translating subtitles for the anonymous film collective Abounaddara and the special collaborative process of working for someone he has never met. Tarnowski uses this experience to reflect on the role of the subtitle, the details lost in translation, and what additional elements and contradictions are created by the differences between subtitles and image.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
