A road movie which brings her from her childhood neighborhood in Brussels to Turkey and Armenia. A quest where each woman she encounters could be the reflection of herself. Entering the land of her ancestors, Anatolia, she questions her cultural heritage. Stopping in her grandmother's village, she discovers the \"Agit\"; an antique oral tradition where women sing for their dead. The songs open a potential space for mourning, where Turkish, Kurdish but also Armenian women missing from that land, can sing \"together\". The confrontation with the \"missing\" from her memory, brings her farther eastward in Anatolia to the foot of the Ararat Mountain, and beyond.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i6yaCElCao3IZuenH0fBCJWwM61.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
