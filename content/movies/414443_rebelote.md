Originally screened with a live string orchestra, the silent black-and-white film has inter-titles and tongue-in-cheek, melodramatic acting and a \"soap opera\" type plot. Unfortunately, the tale of a sad delinquent trying to overcome his miserable childhood to find success at love and life is not a cleverly acted or staged parody, and so the idea falls short of the standards of excellence of bygone, silent screen days.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xoqdzHMdVebXylfs1RQ5Nafg7RB.jpg", "actors": ["Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud ()", "Christophe Bazzini ()", "Olga Georges-Picot ()", "Jacques Robiolles ()", "Tina Aumont ()", "Gabrielle Lazure ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
