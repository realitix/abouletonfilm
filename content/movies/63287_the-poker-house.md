I really like dramas. That film shows how children can survive and even prosper emotionally despite the terrible childhood. The <a href=\"http://befair2rare.com/\">poker games</a> which was shown in the film was so exciting that for a second I thought that it is me the one who was playing poker.\r\nActors have played so plausibly that you begin to sympathize with the heroes without even thinking about it. You start to think as if you are living in this movie. I recommend to anyone who loves dramatic films and films about players."}], "recommandations_id": [8199, 23817, 272602, 102639]}
