Traversing land and sea on an old fishing boat manned by smugglers, the nail-biting journey leads to Europe where the refugees disperse. Each must battle to stay sane and create an identity among the maze of regulations and refugee hostels. The Crossing shows us the lengths to which people go to find safety and forge their own destiny.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5xL8NmseThLAmVsbnuNtN0wRuaW.jpg", "actors": ["Nabil Hilaneh (himself)", "Angela Al Souliman (herself)", "Rami Aramouni (himself)", "Mai Alsouliman (herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
