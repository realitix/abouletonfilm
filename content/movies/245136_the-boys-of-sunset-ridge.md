Determined to play a round at the exclusive Sunset Ridge Country Club despite the fact that none of them are members, the longtime friends sneak onto the golf course, and vow to make their clandestine game an annual event. Over the years, each of the four friends set down different paths in life, but through it all they never miss a game.
