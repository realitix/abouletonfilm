It includes the immediate post-Barrett albums, followed by an exploration of their legendary \"Meddle\" album. Through in-depth interviews with the band, studio clips and archival footage, this film sheds light on the early era of the rock institution that could well be considered a genre of its own.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
