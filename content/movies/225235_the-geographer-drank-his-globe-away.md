Geographer, as the students immediately dub Sluzhkin, attempts to escape from the grueling, dull, stultifying reality of Russia's provincial life in a rafting tour to the Urals. Accompanied by wild, adventure-seeking adolescents, faced with the numerous grim surprises of the nature, Geographer is poised to find himself and his own truth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/amkpAUTpC4dAbr9Yc2W2OMdiL6o.jpg", "actors": ["Konstantin Khabenskiy (Viktor Sluzhkin)", "Elena Lyadova (Nadya)", "Aleksandr Robak (Budkin)", "Evgeniya Khirivskaya (Kira)", "Agrippina Steklova (Roza Borisovna)", "Andrey Prytkov (Gradusov)", "Anfisa Chernykh (Masha)", "Evgeniya Kregzhde (Sashenka)", "Alla Mezentseva ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [127236, 32334, 20963, 62276], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
