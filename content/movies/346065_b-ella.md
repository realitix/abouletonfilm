The film is about true friendships, unrequited romances, school bullying, the desire to be modern, teacher-student relationships and how these impact both the students and the teachers, peer pressure, the impact of stigma and discrimination that comes with HIV/AIDS, the plight of child headed families, and how strong-mindedness and the desire to do right will always prevail.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7y0kYOPDvabrbn4zs5ZtAvL19Fy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
