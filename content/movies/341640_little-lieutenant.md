Scored to John Zorn's arrangement of the Kurt Weill song, \"Little Lieutenant of the Loving God\", and drawing its imagery both from the original song and its somewhat idiosyncratic rearrangement, the film presents an internal reading of Silvers' solo scored to the same musical piece, \"Along the Skid Mark of Recorded History\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oFdcWMQ30vJraCF2GjhQJDtSjb3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
