{"tmdb_id": 250503, "title": "Bad Chicken", "original_title": "Bad Chicken", "slug_title": "bad-chicken", "date": "2013-03-12", "genre": [""], "score": "3.0/10", "synopsis": "All Norah ever wanted to be was a reality TV star. But her dream-come-true quickly turns into a nightmare when she allows a motley television crew of chickens, led by a sociopath, 'Charlie Chicken', to invade her home, manipulate her emotions, and drag her and her soon-to-be-ex-boyfriend into the desert on what is supposed to be a glamorous reality TV shoot. Deep in the surreal landscapes of the Joshua Tree desert, it becomes a battle of species. The hilarious antics of the oddball chicken crew, the blind faith of a reality TV star wannabe, and the cruel perversions of one really 'bad chicken', all spiral downward into an extremely unique Spaghetti Western.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/btxaHWvcUMzX5FeqBNgYzlvwf12.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
