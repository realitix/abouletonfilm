In preparation for their upcoming wedding, Se\u00f1or Manuel takes Luisa back to see his hacienda and introduces his new fianc\u00e9 to the staff. Among which is Gabriel, Manuel's right-hand man, who is not only well respected by the town\u2019s people, but is also the one person that Se\u00f1or Manuel trusts the most. Likewise, Gabriel cares deeply for the old man and is very protective of the haciendero; so much so that during the initial meeting, the fiercely devoted Gabriel immediately becomes suspicious that Luisa is a fake and is only after Se\u00f1or Manuel\u2019s money.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/50ZN9oE2WDVran0oY8rlpHwhti2.jpg", "actors": ["Robin Padilla (Gabriel)", "Regine Velasquez (Luisa)", "Eddie Garcia (Se\u00f1or Manuel)", "Jackie Rice (Hazel)", "Joonee Gamboa (Mang Pagal)", "Pekto (Tikyo)", "Luz Valdez (Aling Loleng)", "Idda Yaneza (Aling Martha)", "Patricia Ysmael (Marimar)", "Kuh Ledesma (Aling Pacing)", "Frannie Zamora (Designer)", "Aura Mijares (Aling Nelly)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
