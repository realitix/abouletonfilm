Josie is Darren\u2019s flatmate. Approaching 30, Josie is desperate to travel, to escape, to do something big. Darren is happy having his meals cooked by someone other than his mum.  Together they drink Buckfast and wander the streets, wondering why their friends are becoming old and boring, with houses and marriages and kitchens to retile.  Together they make fun of squares and make up games, it\u2019s them against the world, or so Josie hopes. How much can you rely on a friend who doesn\u2019t want to grow up?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8Vt8wNpM0vSoPQD42rZBggzzFIg.jpg", "actors": ["Josie Long ()", "Darren Osborne ()", "Joanna Neary ()", "Alison Peebles ()", "Nadia Kamil ()", "Ashley Storrie ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
