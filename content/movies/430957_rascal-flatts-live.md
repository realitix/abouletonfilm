Sudden success can be constraining, and the Daytona Beach-based Live finds guitarist Joe Don Rooney and cousins Jay DeMarcus and Gary Levox--the band's multi-instrumentalist and vocalist, respectively--occasionally (okay, very occasionally) indulging musical passions beyond the slick-and-safe country pop and frothy love-anthems that have endeared them (as a supporting act) to Alan Jackson and Toby Keith's audiences. Among other things, the trio sounds fit to burst with gospel, as suggested by DeMarcus's cameo role as vocalist on a cover of \"Lean on Me.\" (Um, do these guys know he's a better singer than Levox?) There's even a detectable groove on \"Prayin' for Daylight,\" and the group's blowout encore, a cover of Boston's \"Long Time,\" suggests a healthy restlessness within Rascal Flatts' ranks.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
