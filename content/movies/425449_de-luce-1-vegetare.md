In this film, Janis Lipzin blends her enduring interest in nature's volatile events with her sympathy with film's unpredictable response to light. She made a conscious decision to begin with film based on that medium's unduplicable and capricious reaction to photo-chemical stimuli. She used darkroom processes to produce outcomes that allude to (but don't truly describe) color in the natural world. Lipzin then interweaved the results with the more controllable properties of digital technology. By using both digital and analog tools, she was able to achieve results unattainable by either medium alone. The filmmaker's methods allow her to avoid many conventional industrial processes and vastly expand the boundaries of common color palettes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bzWjnpO3LebyPcpAM7jpjo5HiRA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
