The act of looking is implicit in my past documentary work but in this study it becomes the focus. The starting point for the film was the area that I was born and still reside in; the west end of Glasgow and its conjunction with the location where the film was first installed; a flat in Garnethill. The walk between these locations, and also central to the film is, through the St. George\u2019s X area. The film deals with the relationship between sounds and images, acoustic phenomena and architectural details.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/30F2JB4xXLlxh57B4IJBQRjA52G.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
