Young recruits engage in simulated combat training, which barely differs from video games produced as entertainment. Footage is included from a workshop demonstrating the use of computer re-enactments in the psychological care of veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. As a large-scale installation, Serious Games critically focuses on the role of audiovisual culture in the spectacle of war.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yR2o0Ju0sN1ZYyqDgA7JcENuEbF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
