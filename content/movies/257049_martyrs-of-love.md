Mounting a defense of timid, inhibited, clumsy, and unsuccessful individuals, the three protagonists are a complete antithesis of the industrious heroes of socialist aesthetics. Martyrs of Love cemented Nemec\u2019s reputation as the kind of unrestrained nonconformist the Communist establishment considered the most dangerous to their ideology.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ouEYMGWDL4SuxR7cKnZNjE2t4qM.jpg", "actors": ["Lindsay Anderson ()", "Jitka Cerhov\u00e1 ()", "Denisa Dvor\u00e1kov\u00e1 ()", "Karel Gott ()", "Ivana Karbanov\u00e1 ()", "Jan Klus\u00e1k ()", "Josef Kon\u00edcek ()", "Petr Kopriva ()", "Hana Kuberov\u00e1 ()", "Marta Kubisov\u00e1 ()", "Vladimir Preclik ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [154653, 132136, 387646, 454523], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
