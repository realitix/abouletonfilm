When a clever thief (Simon Yam at his overacting best) gets away with a huge heist, he greets the investigating cops with buckets of know-it-all smarm and \"yes, I did it\" charm. He knows he's guilty, and the cops know he's guilty, but how can they prove it? Simon and his buxom girlfriend (Suki Kwan) aren't about to make it easy for the cops, and throw red tape, bureaucratic police procedure, and slimy lawyers in their way. It isn't until the cops devise new and sneakier methods to get the goods that they find a chance to put Simon away. But with only 48 hours in which to interrogate him, do they have enough time? The ethics of cops, as well as Hong Kong's bloated legal system, get a subversive skewering in Twist, an entertaining, slightly twisted cop thriller.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vBvx7z2UCBMf0RCOZyzRVafCsxH.jpg", "actors": ["Danny Lee Sau-Yin (Lee Tit-Kin)", "Simon Yam (John Yam Ka-Wah)", "Suki Kwan (Ann Kwan Oi Ling)", "Michael Chow Man-Kin (Michael Lam)", "Jessica Law Man-Yi (OCTB Policewoman)", "Parkman Wong (Man)", "Emily Kwan (May)", "\u6a0a\u5c11\u7687 (Smarty)", "Melvin Wong (Attorney Melvin Wong)", "Eric Kei (Eric Kei)", "Shing Fui-On (Mao Dong)", "Tommy Wong (Mao Xi)", "Jamie Luk Kim-Ming (Third Mao Brother)", "Lau Siu-Ming (Chief Superintendent Y.K.
