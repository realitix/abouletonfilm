Inspector Lee (Danny Lee) and his team (including Monica Chan and Cheung Kwok-Keung) look into the mysterious disappearance of a seedy loan shark (Ken Lo), but find no real leads. Amazingly, the culprits fall into their laps. Four young men, led by Wong Wing-Man (Sam Lee) confess to the killing. Apparently, they were deep in debt, and found the murder of their friend to be the only way out. There is one problem, though: no physical evidence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2sH1k8sV421Z8kLo2hnOv8VZEd6.jpg", "actors": ["Danny Lee Sau-Yin (Officer Lee)", "Sam Lee (Wong Wing-Man)", "Samuel Leung Cheuk-Moon ()", "Jazz Lam ()", "Monica Chan (Frances)", "Ken Lo ()", "Cheung Kwok-Keung (Brian)", "Chan Ching-Wan ()", "Chin Ka-Lok (Police Constable)", "Emily Kwan (Police Constable)", "Sherming Yiu (Courier Company Boss)", "Lo Lieh ()", "Mok Ga-Yiu ()", "Kwai Chung ()", "Fanny Lee (CID)", "Jude Poyer (SNR Police Officer)", "Ricky Yi Fan-Wai ()", "James Ha ()", "Alan Chan Kwok-Kuen ()", "Siu-hung Chung (Coroner)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
