The plot concerns a group of spies from an unnamed foreign country (gee, they sure sound German) who head westward to undermine American morale. Into this malaise wanders Maynard, supposedly a rootless cowpoke but in reality an FBI agent. Things begin to heat up when the villains lay claim to a helium well on the property owned by heroine Fay McKenzie. The film's silliest moment occurs in mid-stream, when chief villain Charlie King begins beating up everyone within arm's length, with nary a scratch on his own person.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/71HvlhYYgB6Y8B5DLt54Z6KXYia.jpg", "actors": ["Ken Maynard (Ken Baxter)", "Fay McKenzie (Letty Morgan)", "Julian Rivero (Pancho)", "Ralph Peters (Panhandle)", "John Elliott (Hiram Crabtree)", "Charles King (Joe Larkin)", "Charles King (Dr. Flotow)", "Sven Hugo Borg (Baron Starkoff)", "Michael Vallon (Dr. Wahl)", "Julian Madison (Jim Morgan)", "Kenneth Rhodes (Slim)", "Richard Alexander (Big Nick Harden)", "Jack Evans (Townsman)", "Chick Hannan (Mike)", "Murdock MacQuarrie (Sheriff)", "Milburn Morante (Land Recorder)", "Bud Osborne (Bartender Bud)", "Wally West (Deputy)", "Dan White (Townsman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
