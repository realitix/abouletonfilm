In his 1964 short Electronics in the World of Tomorrow, Kurenniemi presents a slideshow of the most aseptic signs of technological imagination: diagrams, chips, machines, cold surfaces. But footage of human warmth also comes up - mostly in black and white, as if to give humans the status of a memory. Originally silent, the film was in this version endowed with a electronic music piece by Kurenneimi himself: a cold, aggressive soundtrack that could be said to present technology as a potentially menacing affair, although this is a reading that the director would certainly refute.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wBsfTj9i6qODiaMXx6wyYGxDlqY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "KjpPJugj6SY"}
