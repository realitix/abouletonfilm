The Hidden is about those unseen, largely unknowable forces that seem to surround us and define our lives. Natalia\u2019s dreams might be expressions of her fears and anxieties, but perhaps they could be messages from some beyond. For Beatriz, what\u2019s \u201chidden\u201d may be less supernatural than emotions she can barely express or control. Antonio Hernandez deftly navigates the lives and feelings of these three characters, gradually peeling away their self-deceptions and delusions until there\u2019s a remarkable and unexpected final revelation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hEmQXaUrZKk6nOA8W7xsz2PVbhu.jpg", "actors": ["Laia Marull (Beatriz)", "Leonardo Sbaraglia (Alex)", "Angie Cepeda (Natalia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "kIrj7bL_it8"}
