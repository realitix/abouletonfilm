There, for hundreds of years, women dive without breathing apparatus, to the ocean floor and collect shellfish, octopus, and urchins that they sell. The divers are in their sixties and seventies and their daughters do not want to inherit their work, lifestyle, and health problems that go with diving. As a filmmaker I was privileged to meet many of these women and dive with them. Their stories of hardship and pride confirmed my desire to record this unique and ancient tradition.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5eOpAp8eEMUbz4FkkF0zPYCHm7h.jpg", "actors": ["Barbara Hammer (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ieG3M_ycmhI"}
