It's been a while since we last heard from Zebrahead, but the Orange County, California-based band is making their presence felt once again with Blood Sweat &amp; Beers a live DVD shot in Tokyo as the band toured their highly successful \"MFZB\" album (GOLF, 2004). Revitalized, road-tightened and eager to redefine their focus, the quintet comes out swinging, delivering a flurry of pummeling rhythms, clench-fisted chords and meaty hooks that connect with each listen. Razor-sharp rockers like \"Rescue Me\" &amp; crowd pleasing favorites like \"Playmate Of The Year\" are all on show here as well as songs from all of the bands albums as they perform for a rabid audience. This DVD shows all the electrifying energy of a live Zebrahead show, blending raging tempos and ringing guitar lines into surging, insistent choruses that stick after a single listen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mrywJKalikA5JfrNcmh2Ui6l2vN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
