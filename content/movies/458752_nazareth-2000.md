Set against the background of the riots surrounding a square that both the municipality and the Muslim community lay claim to, Abu-Assad allows his story to unfold through the eyes of two cynical, funny and wise gas station attendants who have been working at the service station for decades. Their comments on the political and social conditions of their city paint both a tragic and subtle image of its inhabitants.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lGlvV6UTrWlM4HeLSQASSkSRkUl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
