Filmmaker Mark Cousins, who was brought up in a Northern Irish war zone, travels to Goptapa, a Kurdish-Iraqi village of just 700 people on a tributary of the Tigris river, and tries to make a dream film about a place that is normally only portrayed in current affairs programmes. He gives the kids cameras. They make little movies about war, love, a fish that goes to a magical place, and a chicken who debates justice. Despite the production being stopped twice by the Iraqi secret police, The First Movie is about wonder and the power of the imagination.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5vGY53pqWLA9jm5ek4z2iU1ap8O.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [55103, 75364, 71445, 27142], "youtube_key": "H0Pzo84snGw"}
