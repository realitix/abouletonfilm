Calling for a new era of DIY transgender self-representation, Haworths feature debut is a comic, heartbreaking, and uplifting autobiography that breaks away from the marginalized depictions of transsexuals that populate mainstream media and focuses on the interpersonal relationships of a family who unexpectedly find their bonds strengthening as they overcome their preconceptions of gender and sexuality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hIRNasyqb3XrYyebgLoTQhXVP1Y.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
