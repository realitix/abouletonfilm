Together with his fellow prisoners, he founded a school. This unique institution was open to all, welcoming people of all ages and social backgrounds, even the illiterate. Ustica still remembers this revolutionary school. Ustica, remote and neglected, still waits patiently at the harbor, hoping that the boat from the mainland will come.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ft1EEWSEMOfp9sKb2ZalVrnCBbt.jpg", "actors": ["Peppino Mazzotta (Antonio Gramsci)", "Americo Melchionda (Amadeo Bordiga)", "Davide Cirri (Peiro Ventura)", "Maria Milasi (Tabaccaia)", "Maurizio Spicuzza (Contadino)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "nw2JYO4uPr4"}
