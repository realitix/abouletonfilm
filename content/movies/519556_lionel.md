With them there is always more than meets the eye. Ask Lionel Falcon. He knows a thing or two about dogs. He\u2019s a photographer, but not your average one. Lionel is in a very particular line of work. He photographs dogs for a living. And he takes his job seriously. Photo shoots and photo calls. But leave it to Lionel: he always comes up with a new idea that makes both owner and dog extremely happy. Devoted to the idea that you need to be a professional no matter what you do, he always doublechecks his settings, the lights, and his work tools. Everything is under control, because every dog has its day and obviously Lionel needs to have his dogs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e0e82vsrN4iWBnnZKCE218d14Xf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
