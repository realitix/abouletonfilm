But then he wakes up. It's only a dream! That day he boards his private plane, a flying casino, that caters to the needs of the fantastically rich clients who want to play for high stakes at high altitudes. But then the plane is engulfed in a strange thick fog that seeps into the cabin. The evil mist transforms the passengers and crew one by one into monstrous half human, half insect creatures with a ravenous appetite for human flesh. Don realises that it is his nightmare come true - it is his Flight to Hell!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uhyqBumNnbbcgc7J59ee7vUuapv.jpg", "actors": ["Eric Bassanesi (Don)", "Basia Wajs (Janet)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
