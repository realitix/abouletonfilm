He raises his son Jimmy as well as Letty, a baby whose mother has died in childbirth and whose father blames Watt and abandons the child. Watt dreams of returning to do research studies, but always something gets in the way: an epidemic, his children's needs, or the needs of his generally ungrateful patients. Only with the passing years does he come to find that his future isn't over and his past isn't quite the failure he believed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sUWSz5M44H6OGGtWLpdzwCQi9YQ.jpg", "actors": ["Lionel Barrymore (Eli Watt)", "May Robson (Sarah)", "Dorothy Jordan (Letty McGinnis)", "Joel McCrea (Jimmy Watt)", "Frances Dee (Joan Stockton)", "David Landau (McGinnis)", "Buster Phelps (Jimmy Watt - Age 6)", "June Filmer (May Radford)", "James Bush (Bill Radford)", "Oscar Apfel (John Radford)", "Samuel S.
