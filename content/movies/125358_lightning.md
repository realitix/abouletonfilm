All the children are products of different fathers, though they share the same mother: a tragically weak-willed woman named Osei (Kumeko Urabe). The familial tension only increases when the husband of one daughter dies and leaves behind a substantial insurance policy, so Kiyoko abandons them to their quarrels and makes a go of it on her own, though she finds she can't leave her mother behind so easily.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c4D5Jbd2ddycLXk7kdJdyxFVBxK.jpg", "actors": ["Hideko Takamine (Kiyoko)", "Mitsuko Miura (Mitsuko)", "Ky\u00f4ko Kagawa (Tsubomi)", "Chieko Murata (Nuiko)", "Jun Negami (Shuzo)", "Eitar\u00f4 Ozawa (Tsunakichi)", "Kumeko Urabe (Osei)", "Chieko Nakakita (Ritsu)", "Hisako Takihana (Tome)", "Kenzaburo Uemura (Ryuzo)", "Mariko Sugioka (Katsura)", "Osamu Maruyama (Kasuke)", "Tadashi Date ()", "Machiko Hamaji ()", "Kazukie Hidaka ()", "Dok\u00f4 Kihara ()", "Wakayo Matsumura ()", "Ken'ichi Miyajima (Old man at a bus stop)", "Masaharu Sasaki ()", "Nobuko Shingu ()", "Tsuneko Sud\u00f4 ()", "Shin Suzuki ()", "Tooru Takami ()", "Kaku Takashina (Bus driver)", "Yumeko Takehisa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [195237, 224961, 168751, 45987], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
