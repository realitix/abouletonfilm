We also follow retired comic Ritch Shydner's attempt to climb back on stage after a thirteen-year hiatus. At the top of his game in the 1980's, Shydner had HBO specials, shot five pilot TV shows, and numerous late night appearances (Carson, Letterman, Leno, etc.) but the big time eluded him. Equipped with the collective wisdom and nutty musings of over 80 of his peers, he gives it another shot. Does Ritch have what it takes to connect with today's young crowds and still get the laughs?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/driFCrXW28WjFHJFNmyIUzOTE33.jpg", "actors": ["Ahmed Ahmed (Himself)", "Franklyn Ajaye (Himself)", "Ant (Himself)", "Craig Anton (Himself)", "Tom Arnold (Himself)", "JoAnne Astrow (Herself)", "Dave Attell (Himself)", "Scott Aukerman (Himself)", "Lewis Black (Himself)", "Steve Bluestein (Himself)", "Alonzo Bodden (Himself)", "Jordan Brady (Himself)", "Suellen Brady-Nugent (Herself)", "Eddie Brill (Himself)", "J.
