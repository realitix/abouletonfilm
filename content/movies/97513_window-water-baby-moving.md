She's happy. Her lover is nearby; there are close ups of her face, her pregnant belly, and his hands caressing her. She gives birth: we see the crowning of the baby's head, then the birth itself; we watch a pair of hands tie off and cut the umbilical cord. With the help of the attending hands, the mother expels the placenta. The infant, a baby girl, nurses. We return from time to time to the bath scene. By the end, dad's excited; mother and daughter rest.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vnJ6qK7Xo5dM4T7FDFVuYjeixYX.jpg", "actors": ["Stan Brakhage (Self (Father))", "Myrrena Brakhage (Self (Baby))", "Jane Brakhage (Self (Mother))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [97517, 126215, 126216, 126189], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
