Launching alternative comedy onto our screens, the show made household names of its performers and writers and proved to be a huge influence, despite the BBC reportedly being baffled by what they'd commissioned back in 1982. Never before had a flagship comedy show contained so much violence, depravity and anarchy - it was a shot across the bow to mainstream comedians that things would never be the same again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zFRToQOCAuPYJdiKXZLVWK3A8ms.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
