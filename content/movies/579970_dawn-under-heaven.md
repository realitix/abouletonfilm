It\u2019s a story about friendship, hope, and sacrifice in the face of overwhelming odds.  The project began in Lee Anderson\u2019s garage in the summer of 2010 during the emerging era of Halo cosplay, YouTube culture, and affordable digital filmmaking tools. At the time there was a surprising lack of live-action Halo storytelling, which drove us (and many other fan films) to build our own piece of the Halo universe.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
