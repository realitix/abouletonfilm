On the verge of being broke, Handel struggled to write his celebrated oratorio, Messiah. The story behind Messiah celebrates freed debtors, charitable giving, rescued children, and the Messiah's mission to save God\u2019s children from spiritual death.  With its Christ-centered focus, Hallelujah! invites listeners to feel the true meaning of Christmas. The music includes favorites such as \u201cDo You Hear What I Hear?\u201d performed by Osnes, \u201cOh, Come, All Ye Faithful,\u201d \u201cAngels from the Realms of Glory,\u201d and many more, including a breathtaking rendition of \u201cFor unto Us a Child Is Born\u201d from Handel\u2019s Messiah, performed by the Metropolitan Opera soloists. The Christmas story, as told in the book of Luke in the New Testament, is poetically narrated by Jarvis.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7rWhCPX66RQOTvTXOJd3Ea6dewk.jpg", "actors": ["Laura Osnes ()", "Martin Jarvis ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
