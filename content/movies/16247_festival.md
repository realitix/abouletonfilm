The headliners are Peter, Paul and Mary, Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, and Bob Dylan, who's acoustic and electric. Son House and Mike Bloomfield talk about the blues; John Hurt, Howlin' Wolf, and Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee show its range. The Osborne Brothers perform bluegrass. Donovan, Johnny Cash, Judy Collins, Mimi and Dick Farina, and others less well known also perform. Several talk musical philosophy, and there's a running commentary about the nature and appeal of folk music. The crowd looks clean cut.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qFWBzI0AmGUVOxffjIBvhaRTQuQ.jpg", "actors": ["Horton Barker (Himself)", "Fiddler Beers (Himself)", "Theodore Bikel (Himself)", "Pete Seeger (Himself)", "Bob Dylan (Himself)", "Howlin' Wolf (Himself)", "The Osborne Brothers (Themselves)", "Donovan (Himself)", "Johnny Cash (Himself)", "Judy Collins (Herself)", "Mike Bloomfield (Himself)", "Son House (Himself)", "Brownie McGhee (Himself)", "Sonny Terry (Himself)", "Peter Yarrow (Himself)", "Paul Stookey (Himself)", "Mary Travers (Herself)", "Buffy Sainte-Marie (Herself)", "Joan Baez (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
