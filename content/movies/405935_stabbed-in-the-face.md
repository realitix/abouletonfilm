Follow a group of teenagers into the woods for a good time. Undoubtedly, you'll find serial killers, red herrings, boobs and booze all in one night. Leaving little to the imagination, Terror Optics continues the party-film concept of having a really good time with little regard to critics and potential fans. Set in an undeterminable time period, stocked with a slew of villains and well deserving victims, Stabbed in the Face proves that slasher films are ONLY about the boobs, butts, and body count.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7aGX7uDimtFzbrtC4D9QDduXbiT.jpg", "actors": ["Dana Kieferle (Madelyn)", "Bill Heintz (Joseph)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
