Two girls and two boys, probably about 14 or 15 years old, play a game of truth or dare. The questions and the challenges deal with sex; it's innocent and harmless, but at each turn, each youth tries to raise the ante. Then, Paul gives a dare to Rose, and the result brings on a sudden and complete silence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wG0NR1lBVJ9RBHu2aK56P1bjYKq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [82040], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
