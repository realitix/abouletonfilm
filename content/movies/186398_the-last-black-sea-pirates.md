Only one thing is missing: the ship. According to legend, Vulchan, a 19th-century gypsy pirate, attacked three convoys laden with gold. He robbed them, sunk them and hid his treasure by the coast. Fast forward to present day. Captain Jack, an ex-con himself, leads a motley bunch of homeless outcasts\u2014alcoholics and petty criminals\u2014in a search for the hidden loot. But their hopes of riches and glory are threatened when the brother of the Bulgarian Prime Minister announces plans to build a new mega tourist resort by the Black Sea.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jHK3TE4N6W7wvOm7HvRC3KofN9P.jpg", "actors": ["Ivan Ivanov (Captain Jack The Whale)", "Ilko Iliev (Himself)", "Zoya Nikolova (Herself)", "Krasimir Panov (Himself)", "Stoyan Nedev (Himself)", "Valentin Nenkov (Himself)", "Trifon Nedev ()", "Yanaki Radev ()", "Dimitrichka Yankova ()", "Jean-Louis Jais ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "pBbX1AMSg6Y"}
