This pseudo-documentary features a Canadian filmmaker who is looking into the group of dissidents. He interviews them to get the story of what happened recorded for posterity. Among the group was another man of Spanish ancestry who suddenly arrived on the island but managed to find a way out. His future exploits are brought into question since there are certain terrorist connotations to his character.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2w9qerF4QLU2iQkJMToJNlI4ZOc.jpg", "actors": ["Agn\u00e8s Ch\u00e2teau ()", "Didier Sauvegrain ()", "Emilio S\u00e1nchez-Ortiz ()", "Francesco Curto ()", "Yves Albert ()", "Bruno Madinier ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
