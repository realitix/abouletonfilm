Every year, over 500 people in the UK are convicted of murder. A guilty verdict can only be challenged if new evidence comes to light - and less than 1% of cases are ever overturned. Inside Justice is a specialist charity led by Louise Shorter, supported by a panel of criminal lawyers, ex-police officers and forensics experts who offer assistance to prisoners who are protesting their innocence. In this series, we meet Louise as she investigates a case, looking for evidence that could present grounds to bring an appeal - and ultimately overturn the conviction of a Southampton man in prison for the murder of his secret lover.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o1eMyFaXzRY7PWa33ye9VneCTxP.jpg", "actors": ["Louise Shorter (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
