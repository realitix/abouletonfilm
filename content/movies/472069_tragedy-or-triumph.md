I stepped into the crosswalk... a few seconds later I found myself on the hood of a car, holding on and wondering why the driver wasn't stopping.  I immediately started praying and asking  Jesus to help me...  I remember a warmth coming over my body, and I knew I was going to be all right.  I had peace, just like the Bible says, that is beyond understanding or explanation.  I don't know how I got off the hood, but now I was on the street.  The next vehicle that came swerved to the left and missed me, bet kept going.  A lady driving a school bus saw the car swerve and thought there was debris on the road.  Then she realized that it was someone screaming for help, so she parked the bus so that it would protect me from oncoming traffic and called the police.  Had it not bee for this school bus driver, who knows?\"  -- Martina Gonzales", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wq9jE0nucFeKCrF7zQVM7agoVD6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
