Simmons has proved to be an innovative entrepreneur and has often surprised business analysts with the success of his ingenious get-rich-quick schemes. Flexing his oratory skills, Gene shares some sage advice (with his trademark deadpan delivery) and presents some pithy insights.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
