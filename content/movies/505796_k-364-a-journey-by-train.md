However, the two musicians chose an unusual route to get there -- viola player Levitan and violinist Shiloah took the train from Berlin to Warsaw, in effect following the same path their parents were forced to use when they were sent to the Third Reich's death camps in 1939. Filmmaker Douglas Gordon and his camera crew were on hand for the trip, and K.364: A Journey By Train is a documentary that contrasts the beauty of Mozart's music and the enthusiasm of two world class musicians with the legacy of one of the darkest episodes in human history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dqPRNmoNiQlJGOESMb0HZ5qEugz.jpg", "actors": ["Avri Levitan ()", "Agnieszka Duczmal ()", "Roi Shiloah ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
