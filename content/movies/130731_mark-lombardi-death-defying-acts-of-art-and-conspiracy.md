Lombardi had hung himself one year earlier in his New York studio. Who was this Mark Lombardi, a man whose work was so explosive that even terrorist hunters were using it as research? The film portrays an incredibly brilliant artist who took on the social function of a watchdog by using public information and arranging it to expose the grand illegal practices in the globalized world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nJIqTwEL2qVvRbq0mgx6ng51VYG.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Lombardi (himself)", "Joe Amrhein (himself)", "James Harithas (himself)", "Donald Lombardi (himself)", "Shirley Lombardi (herself)", "Matthew Lombardi (himself)", "Lisa Lombardi LaRue (herself)", "Laura Lombardi Mills (herself)", "Hilary Ann Maslon (herself)", "James Siena (himself)", "Greg Stone (himself)", "Susan Swenson (herself)", "Fred Tomaselli (himself)", "Edward Tufte (himself)", "Rafael Vargas-Suarez (himself)", "Robert Hobbs (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
