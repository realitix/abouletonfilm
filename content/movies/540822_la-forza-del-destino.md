Topping the list is Nina Stemme, who gives a full-blooded portrayal of Leonora. Passionate forceful readings are also provided by Salvatore Licitra as Alvaro and Carlos \u00c1lvarez as Don Carlo. Zubin Mehta leads Staatsoper Orchestra with agility, subtleness and relaxed mastery, and right from the start David Poutney establishes an atmosphere of entrapment by fate. With the aid of a bizarre, unforgettable stage construction, the acclaimed director finds an ideal setting to illustrate the merciless powers of chance and destiny.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eIkNLMTybXFFd6adz7ZnhHGDjPt.jpg", "actors": ["Carlos \u00c1lvarez (Don Carlo)", "Nina Maria Stemme ()", "Salvatore Licitra (Alvaro)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
