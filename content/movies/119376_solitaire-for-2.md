Being desirable, the male minds she reads are all thinking of one thing. She always responds by hitting them and storming off without explanation. Daniel is an expert in body language and interprets this as a sign she wants to be pursued. Since Daniel spends most of his time, when not terrorizing his students, pursuing women, Katie gets ever more exasperated that he is treating her exactly as he treats every presentable female from the motorcycle cop to the squeegee girl. She cannot read minds when her eyes are covered, or when minds are thinking in a foreign language, so she misinterprets Sandip's desire for hunger. She also holds Daniel responsible for his subconscious desire for his friend's wife (Caroline).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rTFOe8qCVoKTXKmR6UWKl2hAgTC.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Frankel (Daniel Becker)", "Amanda Pays (Katie Burrough)", "Maryam d'Abo (Caroline)", "Roshan Seth (Sandip Tamar)", "Jason Isaacs (Harry)", "Annette Crosbie (Mrs. Dwyer)", "Helen Lederer (Motorcycle Cop)", "Malcolm Cooper (Motorcycle Cop)", "Neil Mullarkey (Parris)", "Liza Walker (Lucy)", "Catherine Russell (Julie Parris)", "Arthur Smith (Man in Bookshop)", "Isobel Raine (Wet n Wild Assistant)", "Rosalind Knight (Receptionist)", "Diana Eskell (Squeegee Girl)", "Paul Simpkin (Waiter)", "Right Said Fred (Themselves)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
