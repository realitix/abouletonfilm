In all-but-lost gems such as La donna nuda(1914), and Tigre reale (1916), superstars such as Lyda Borelli and Pina Menichelli portrayed heroines teetering dangerously between defiant indulgence in sexual passion and hysterical remorse at their own cruelties. Delpeut\u2019s inventive celebration of Black Romanticism is both striking and heartbreaking in its composition\u2014a beautifully woven narrative of tempted fate and self-torment, elegantly guided by Loek Dikker\u2019s original score. Zeitgeist Films is proud to present Delpeut\u2019s stunningly experimental work in all its heaving bosomed, luridly tinted glory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A8cVlBkJrVapzquOkF2sID1ytvP.jpg", "actors": ["Lyda Borelli ()", "Pina Menichelli ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
