Filmmaker Marc Geerards tracked down 200 people and asked them to appear in front of the camera again, this time a film camera and in a setting of their own choice. A fascinating social document which portrays the passing of time, and the evolvement of the individual as well as the sub culture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x0AzuGVUVto64TR3COtlFlNLY1k.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
