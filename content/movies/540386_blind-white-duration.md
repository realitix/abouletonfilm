The viewer is introduced to a limited range of images (a snowy day in Harrow, walking to the Metropolitan Line station) shown in brief fade-ins and outs or quick flashes. For most of the film, the screen remains white. This is a film about the light of the projector, the white screen and the white image which emerges out of it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/agHMHmLTtWKQ0cok9p6A0l1GfQ5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
