Viola moves toward the camera/viewer, pausing every few steps to ring a bell, at which point he is momentarily thrust back to his starting place, and then advanced again. Finally reaching his destination, he is taken through all of the previous stages in a single instant and returned to the source of his journey.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4Uh0xNlZJUz5d8S2I9MZRp7if2k.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
