Lillian Lee is rumoured to have written the original screenplay in the late 1970s, which was made into a two-part television series on RTHK by Alex Law under the name King Chau and Lady Yu. Lee then adapted the story into a novel in 1985, which later inspired a feature film, scripted again by Lee and directed by Fifth Generation mainstay Chen Kaige, going on to become an international sensation that won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and Best Foreign Film at the Golden Globe Awards among other accolades. What's more, the Peking opera of the same title featured prominently in the novel, the TV programme and the film was itself adapted from a Kun opera, which was in turn based on the historical chronicle Basic Annals of Xiang Yu, from Records of the Grand Historian.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Elliot Yueh Hua ()", "Alan Yue ()", "\u6a0a\u5c11\u7687 ()", "Lee Yue-tin ()", "Lee Man-Tai ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
