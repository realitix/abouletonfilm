We see all aspects of their life: farming, herding, cooking, football, and making music during a Pachamama festival. In the course of filming, the leader of the Kolla community changes the filmmakers' view of what the documentary should be, and at the end of their visit they are changed. \"La vida se puede ir amasando, como el barro\": As life goes along, it becomes more pliant, like clay. An announcement at the beginning of the film states that this is neither fiction nor documentary, but I'd say it's closer to documentary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gAjK94WWvVnEiDOnnw6BCyawJrH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
