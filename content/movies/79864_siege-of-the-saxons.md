Directed by Nathan Juran and starring Janette Scott and Ronald Lewis, it\u2019s all about medieval malarkey as Lewis\u2019 Robin Hood type character wanders the lands with Scott\u2019s disguised princess in search of Merlin (John Laurie). They need the great wizard to stop the dastardly Edmund of Cornwall (Ronald Howard) from seizing the throne of Arthur with help from the Saxons.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s played for light hearted thrills, the cast having fun prancing about in their borrowed costumes (much of the production uses props, costumes and footage from some earlier swords and shields movies), and Juran never lets the story sag and knows when to perk things up with an action scene or some character merriment. Harmless fluff really. Played as the \u201cB\u201d picture to Jason and the Argonauts and in that context it\u2019s a fun enough warmer upper! 5/10"}], "recommandations_id": [249313, 58867, 282662, 192162], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
