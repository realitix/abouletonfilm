The film starts out as a war movie, showing his father Manuel battling the Spanish and taking a white woman as his captive bride. But little of interest happens after Ceferino is born. His beatification relies partly on his \"miraculous\" survival after falling in a stream as a baby, but the film does not present this with any great drama, and plods through the rest of the boy's life with similar tepor. Ceferino does well in school, attracts the interest of a priest, attends a Catholic school in Buenos Aires, and studies for the priesthood in Italy, where he dies of tuberculosis after a few unconvincing coughs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eBsALJttx21EY2CMXP1mzYp8G0t.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
