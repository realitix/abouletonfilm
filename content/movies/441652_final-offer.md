Bob White, labour leader of the Canadian branch of the UAW, must also confront his American counterpart from Detroit and succeeds in arriving at a contract that is significantly Canadian.

It's an extraordinary film about revolutionary events.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2M1hqpQ3FOvER5220xvrvxjfwWW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
