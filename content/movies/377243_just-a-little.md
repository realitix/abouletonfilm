Little Pig is feeling happy and decides to go for a swim. On the way she meets a hedgehog with too few prickles, a crow whose beak is too long, a green lamb and a little calf covered in white spots. None of them look quite 'normal'. They all set off with Little Pig to go swimming. They help out a turtle, who grants each of them a wish. But nothing turns out quite the way they planned.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g77rMZ1BqANT1KFwQs2z9VUmUnm.jpg", "actors": ["Maud Cantoreggi (Igelkotten/Kalven (voice))", "Sissela Benn (Lilla Grisen/Lammet (voice))", "Harald Leander (Kr\u00e5kan/Paddan/ber\u00e4ttare (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
