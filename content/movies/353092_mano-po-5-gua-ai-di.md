She is doomed by strict family traditions to only wed someone of pure Chinese descent. But Charity finds love where she was not supposed to find it... at least according to her cold-hearted mother. Despite being met with resistance by her traditional Chinese family, most especially her mother, Charity continues her relationship with Nathan. Nathan, on the other hand, proves himself and his love to her by making an effort to learn about her background, culture and language resulting into various mishaps, sometimes comical and other times just plain disastrous. Charity finds solace in the kitchen, her cooking interwoven with the story of her ill-fated romance. Will true love prevail in the end? And will she be able to come up with the perfect recipe for love?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5GcoLaOj4yNWTKHxgwktjdgrfTb.jpg", "actors": ["Angel Locsin (Charity)", "Richard Gutierrez (Nathan)", "Christian Bautista (Felix Yan)", "Lorna Tolentino (Yolanda)", "Gina Alajar ()", "Tirso Cruz III ()", "Irma Adlawan ()", "Boots Anson-Roa ()", "Ethel Booba ()", "Sam Concepcion ()", "AJ Dee ()", "Ketchup Eusebio ()", "Ella Guevara ()", "Jaclyn Jose ()", "Paolo Jose ()", "Tony Mabesa ()", "Michelle Madrigal ()", "Lorenzo Mara ()", "Jim Pebanco ()", "Joyce So ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
