For 30 years, Arrernte man Rupert Max Stuart has maintained his innocence of the rape and murder of a young white girl. His story became the basis for the movie Black and White in 2002. In Broken English, we hear from Max and those personally involved in the case. Max Stuart claims he fell prey to prejudices in the white justice system and alleges he was beaten and verballed by police. He spent 14 years in prison and faced the gallows nine times for the crime he says he didn't commit. This film, which combines documentary and drama, recreates some of the events of his trial, appeals and subsequent Royal Commission. It features Hugo Weaving, Noah Taylor and Tony Barry, with Lawrence Turner playing Max Stuart.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x6CpBiGwsM1QrPBEsuxsl9YZlwe.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
