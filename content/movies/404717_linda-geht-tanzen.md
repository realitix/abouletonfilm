The business is going well, and with his talent, Frank has made a star. But that does not satisfy the ambitious perfectionist: he wants a second star, no matter what he wants. No wonder that the romantically inclined Linda feels increasingly neglected by her workaholic spouse - until she finds a charming admirer in the florist Peer. The passionate dancer brings new life into her life and leaves no stone unturned to win her heart.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oRnZS6ZN5x9nGdXxf54Lc8EOLkq.jpg", "actors": ["Julia J\u00e4ger (Linda Hessler)", "Rolf Hoppe (Wilhelm Hessler)", "Dieter Landuris (Peer L\u00fcders)", "Winfried K\u00fcppers (Restauranttester V.
