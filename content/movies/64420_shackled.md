After the signing of the military agreement in Kumanovo, in the house of the retarded, the guards and employees leave their places and flee. Inmates are all retarded but they have a special philosophy of life, they have their wishes and their dreams. Being free gives them a chance to make dreams come true, but they are confronted with a reality and environment, which in one way or another is very different. From the moment of getting out the fences, they are conflicted with people that call themselves free. Gradually this conflict roughens and with it degenerates the meaning of freedom. There are three main characters, Kukum, Mara and Hasan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2eyxBsbXfjzlV7HJvfjHM6EdFgD.jpg", "actors": ["Anisa Ismaili (Mara)", "Luan Jaha (Kukum)", "Donat Qosja (Hasan)", "Shkumbin Istrefi (Gafurri)", "Yllka Gashi (Zarifja)", "Astrit Kabashi (Huligan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
