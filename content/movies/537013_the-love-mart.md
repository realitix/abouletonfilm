He meets a beautiful young woman and pursues her, but she dismisses his attentions because she thinks he is just a barber. Also pursuing the woman is the evil Capt. Remy, whom she also brushes off. He, however, doesn't take rejection so lightly, and forges papers \"proving\" that the girl is a \"quadroon\"--part black, which means that she can be sold as a slave. She is sold to Capt. Remy, and when Victor hears of it, he determines to rescue her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p1SfrVYnlyN0DmHVlweiTxOW8we.jpg", "actors": ["Billie Dove (Antoinette Frobelle)", "Gilbert Roland (Victor Jallot)", "Ray Turner (Poupet (as Raymond Turner))", "Noah Beery (Capt.
