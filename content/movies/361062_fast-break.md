Inter-cutting excerpts from the 1977 playoff / championship season, the film steps outside of the basketball court, and into the everyday lives of the Trailblazers, as well as their coach Jack Ramsey. Whether it\u2019s biking the Oregon coast with star center Bill Walton, hosting a kids basketball camp with Dave Twardzik, or joking with Maurice Lucas at the pool \u2013 Fast Break lets the players speak for themselves: about basketball, life and playing in Portland.  Fast Break, a film documentary about Bill Walton and the Portland Trail Blazers winning the 1976-77 NBA title and the aftermath of their accomplishment, is the greatest movie I have ever seen on the subject of professional team sports, basketball as a metaphor for life, and the perfect practice of Zen Buddhism in American society.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8eqMeqlWnpIRcu2myf4MNM5Yjqp.jpg", "actors": ["Don Zavin ()", "Bill Walton ()", "Jack Ramsey ()", "Dave Twardzik ()", "Maurice Lucas ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
