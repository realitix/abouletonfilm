Their stories are outlined in a short space of time and are a symbolic representation of the drama of life, struggle for justice, human cognizance and the healing power of love. One of the most important components of the film is the nature, which ceases to be a mere stage for its plot\u2014it serves almost as an autonomous plot agent. The movie landscape is a precisely defined and localized one. Only the South Bohemian ponds can serve as the right environment for development of such earthy and typically human stories as we encounter in the Mist on the Moors.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Zden\u011bk \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nek (Josef Potuzak)", "Vladim\u00edr Sala\u010d (Vaclav)", "Rudolf Hru\u0161\u00ednsk\u00fd (Vojta)", "Terezie Brzkov\u00e1 (Grandmother)", "Jarmila Smejkalov\u00e1 (Apolenka)", "Marie Blazkov\u00e1 (Potuzak's Wife)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
