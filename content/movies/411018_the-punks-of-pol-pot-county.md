CPg was one of the first Hungarian punk (not skinhead) groups. In the eyes of the political leadership, they were the most reactionary and the rudest. Their songs sounded like a naive, somewhat anarchistic social criticism but were never racists. They were sentenced to two years in prison.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/arg7jIvDPeDk8ouuAe16r0BxWK6.jpg", "actors": ["Zolt\u00e1n Benk\u0151 (Himself)", "B\u00e9la Haska (Himself)", "Zolt\u00e1n Nagy (Himself)", "Zolt\u00e1n Varga (Himself)", "Fer\u00f3 Nagy (Himself)", "Mikl\u00f3s Haraszti (Himself)", "J\u00e1nos Seb\u0151k (Himself)", "R\u00f3bert P\u00e1link\u00e1s Sz\u0171cs (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
