A coincidence causes the former shrunken and skeletonized school principle to rise again. When she manages to return to real life she almost defeats Otto Leonhard, manages to shrink Dr. Schmitt-G\u00f6ssenwein and Felix' parents, and takes over the school. It takes Felix, Ella and their gang to set the levers in motion to save the school and bring Dr. Schmitt-G\u00f6ssenwein and his parents back to their original size again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x5iak3BbvRjuT4Q1rZoLDjTYMSX.jpg", "actors": ["Oskar Keymer (Felix)", "Otto Waalkes (Otto Leonhard)", "Andrea Sawatzki (Direktorin Hulda Stechbarth)", "Axel Stein (Vater)", "Julia Hartmann (Mutter)", "Anja Kling (Dr. Schmitt-G\u00f6ssenwein)", "Maximilian Ehrenreich (Chris)", "Johannes Zeiler (Hausmeister Michalski)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [537376, 438751, 527267, 460571], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
