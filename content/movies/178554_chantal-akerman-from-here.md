It\u2019s always very instructive. As is the case here too. Chantal Akerman, passing through South America, talks about herself for an hour, and it\u2019s fascinating. Even if her recalling of the relationship between the cinema and time makes up only a few rare minutes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m6noYE6raAz8qzfOA5D8u9yVSh5.jpg", "actors": ["Chantal Akerman (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
