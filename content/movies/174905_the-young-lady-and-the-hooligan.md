Her task consists in teaching a class of adults to read and write. All her students are male, ranging from boys to old men, and they are rather rowdy and difficult. All the more as a young hooligan dares write her on a test paper that he loves her. Feeling harassed by the young man, she is defended by other students. But she more or less feels the young bad boy's love is true and when this one is lying on his dying bed, after being stabbed by the other students, she solaces him by kissing him tenderly.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1XtsastM0KbqwG1abtAgsJqySIf.jpg", "actors": ["Vladimir Mayakovsky (the Hooligan)", "Aleksandra Rebikova (the Teacher)", "Fedor Dunayev (the Principal)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
