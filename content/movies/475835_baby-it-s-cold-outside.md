Although her free spirit makes her the perfect travel writer, a surprising breakup with her boyfriend takes her personal life back to square one. Hoping to spend the holiday relaxing and recovering, Emory takes the picturesque Christmas vacation planned for the two of them, alone. Through a mix up on the rental site - or maybe a little Christmas magic - Emory is forced to share the cabin with a handsome widower, his young daughter, and mother-in-law.
