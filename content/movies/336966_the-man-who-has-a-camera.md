It displays impressionistic street spectacle and images of quotidian life, as well as excursions by train and ship, unfolding as a private visual journal and a sort of souvenir, but with refined framing, camera movement, and rhythmic editing. With his own perspective and artistic sensitivity embedded in this film, struggling between being a Japanese colonial subject and a Taiwanese/Chinese litterateur, Liu attempts to transcend geological, national, racial/ethnic, linguistic and medial boundaries, to establish a depoliticized, internationalist, cosmopolitan cinematic utopia, a pure cinema, and a fluid and contested identity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4vBsIkJxBWkHdNNEUgeWwcDt4nX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
