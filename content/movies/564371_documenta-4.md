The film reflects this effervescence, giving voice to the artists, curators, and audience, but also offers a unique approach to an exhibition in progress. We watch Sol LeWitt constructing Three-Part Variations; Joseph Beuys installing Raumplastik; Martial Raysse talking about the role of the artist; Harald Szeemann defending the concept of the museum; and Edward Kienholz explaining his work from inside his Roxys installation, among many others.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
