In her first film appearance since The Rose Tattoo, Anna Magnani plays a feisty nun named Sister Letizia. Believing herself above such earthly trivialities as a maternal instinct, Sr. Letizia changes her way of thinking when an abandoned child is placed in her care. Unofficially adopting the boy, the good sister eventually comes to realize that even she cannot provide the care and guidance of a biological mother. Carefully constructed to accommodate all the surefire box-office elements inherent in Camerini's earlier films, Suor Letizia was almost guaranteed to be a hit.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6mE8ultdS9MMnn5DGZPKqQCJDnq.jpg", "actors": ["Anna Magnani ()", "Piero Boccia ()", "Leonilde Montesi ()", "Lina Tartara Minora ()", "Emma Baron ()", "Eleonora Rossi Drago ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
