The only moment in his drab life that's out of the ordinary each year seems to be opening the birthday card and gift from his mother. Usually it's a tie, but one year it's an accordion. It goes into the closet with his many ties. A year or two later, he discovers what happens to the papers he processes every day. His discovery sends him first to the building's top floor, then to his closet.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x9MRBnLZQ0rnTxCKMZstYBguiZx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [118010], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
