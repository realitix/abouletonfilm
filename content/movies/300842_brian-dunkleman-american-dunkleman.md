As is the case with the former American Idol co-host who left the Idol series after just the first season. \"I just thought they where mean to the contestants... well I did.\" We think he made the right choice because Brian is one of the funniest comedians working today proving hands down and once and for all that comedy is a skill earned. Brian takes us through his life post Idol in a humorous and self-deprecating way that is both hilarious and endearing.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
