All the main players, Woody Harrelson, Elisabeth Shue, Gina Gershon and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny were very good. Good story with a few twists and just a touch of comedy. And the scene with Harrelson and Shue in the bungalow was hot. I give it a 8/10."}], "recommandations_id": [268536, 171780, 55151, 13903]}
