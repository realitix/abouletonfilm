In 1975, Irish immigrant Denis Mulcahy of the NYPD bomb squad  \u2013 gathered a group of family, friends and neighbours to start a scheme offering children from Northern Ireland a chance to temporarily escape the violent turmoil of their daily lives. From modest beginnings, Project Children ultimately brought over 20,000 Catholic and Protestant children to suburban US for summer-long visits where they forged unexpected friendships and found they had more in common with the 'enemy' than they thought. Now this extraordinary untold story is being brought to the screen in a new documentary by Des Henderson, and narrated by Liam Neeson, entitled How To Defuse A Bomb: The Project Children Story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kqvXJmXDd4gsbb8b3zKJM4qnb9e.jpg", "actors": ["Liam Neeson (Narrator)", "Denis Mulcahy (Himself)", "Bill Clinton (Himself)", "Eamonn McCann (Himself)", "Pat Mulcahy ()", "Duke Hoffman ()", "Carol Hoffman ()", "Monica Culburt ()", "Nancy Stanfield ()", "Jim Stanfield ()", "Peter Stanfield ()", "Carol Wheeler ()", "Kitty Higgins ()", "Mary Anne Sullivan ()", "Rep Jim Walsh ()", "Congressman Joe Crowley ()", "Carol Hoffman (Herself)", "Monica Culburt (Herself)", "Nancy Stanfield (Herself)", "Carol Wheeler (Herself)", "Kitty Higgins (Herself)", "Mary Anne Sullivan (Herself)", "Pat Mulcahy (Himself)", "Duke Hoffman (Himself)", "Jim Stanfield (Himself)", "Peter Stanfield (Himself)", "Rep Jim Walsh (Himself)", "Congressman Joe Crowley (Himself)", "Martin McGuinness (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "jiEZyQlCZhU"}
