Alex To plays a handsome fashion designer trapped in a tangle of ambiguous relationships that becomes even more complex when he falls for a beautiful D.J. (Cecilia Yip) who, with the help of her best friend (Cherie Chung), is trying to get out of an arranged marriage. This film looks and sounds like a comedy, but has some serious comments about a veiled segment of Hong Kong.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2yvpZd1XrrJ6N6vRqxbgo16ZM6r.jpg", "actors": ["Cherie Chung (Rockie)", "Cecilia Yip (Jeanne Cha)", "Alex To Tak-Wai (Abel Song)", "Lin Lin Li (Deborah)", "Chan Git-Leng (Jeanne's 3rd aunt)", "Lam Lap-San (Derek Dai)", "Regina Kent (Jamie)", "Stephen Ho Kai-Nam (Koku)", "Thomas Wong Yiu-Fai ()", "Dennis Chan (Dr Anthony Lau)", "Chung Fat (Fake Mr X)", "Tam Tin-Nam (Hunchback housekeeper)", "Chan Ga-Bik (Jeanne's colleague)", "Ngai Tim-Choi (Man slashed by Mr X)", "Wong Kar-wai ()", "Tong Gwok-Ming ()", "Kwan Yik-Nam ()", "Stephanie Lai Ming-Sze ()", "Bobby Yap ()", "Chan Pui-San ()", "Tse Chu-Hong ()"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "ColinJ", "content": "A very enjoyably HK farce that treats the subject of homosexuality with far more class and decency than the average HK comedy."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
