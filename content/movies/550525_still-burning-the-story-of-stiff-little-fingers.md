Formed in Belfast, their lyrics melded the personal and political with infectious hooks to create a unique sound that has influenced a generation. Celebrating their 30th Anniversary in 2007, and shot during their successful March 2007 tour, 'Still Burning' presents the band's definitive story and includes the band's 30th anniversary performance of the entire first album live from Ulster Hall, Belfast in March 2007. Directed by Don Letts and with contributions from many of the members through the years and other punk luminaries including Steve Diggle (Buzzcocks) and Mike Peters (The Alarm), the film charts the ups and downs, the splits and reformations of the band.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bCHMZNbNpGjVsff4h3KWNkju4Q2.jpg", "actors": ["Stiff Little Fingers ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
