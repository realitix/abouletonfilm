Through his friend, Baron von Sinclair, romantic and rebellious poet Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin secures the position of a private tutor in the home of a banker named Gontard. He is soon torn between his passion for poetry and his love for Susette, the lady of the house. To top it all off, Baron von Sinclair is in love with him. H\u00f6lderlin's most beautiful poems are written during this trying time. However, he becomes a total recluse when he loses Susette. The film examines the effects of conflicting demands, both emotional and sensual, that may inspire art. Feuerreiter was screened as part of the New German Films at the 49th International Berlin Film Festival, 1999.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pC5Lg0ZSQ6vBk9tZtE6HxyUnW5Q.jpg", "actors": ["Martin Feifel ()", "Marianne Denicourt ()", "Ulrich M\u00fche ()", "Matthias Faber ()", "Ulrich Matthes ()", "Nina Hoss ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
