One beautiful summer evening Mikko and his wife Liisa invite old friends to a party in the villa: divorced intellectual Erik who gets along a little too well with Liisa; and noisy building contractor Hessu with his young and sexy new wife Pirre. Their increasingly drunken discussions are interrupted by a surprise visit from Mikko's and Liisa's daughter Jonna and her husband Pete. A conflict between the father and the daughter ensues in front of the guests.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n6v6R8jMsSuVXQ0tOMn3W1JXV3W.jpg", "actors": ["Pertti Palo (Mikko)", "Sirkku Grahn (Liisa)", "Pauli Virtanen (Heikki)", "Eeva Eloranta (Pirre)", "Mauri Heikkil\u00e4 (Erik)", "Pirkko Uitto (Jonna)", "Matti Laustela (Pete)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
