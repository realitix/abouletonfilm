One of Eugene Buck\u2019s motivations for making the film may have been his rough cross-examination during his kidnappers\u2019 first trials, in October 1913, when defense attorneys cast him as a confused and unreliable witness against idealistic freedom fighters.  On film he could reproduce the pursuit, the shootouts, his kidnapping, and his friend\u2019s murder just as he had testified.  Reenacting the crime on film may have been the best revenge\u2014and a way to honor the sacrifice of Deputy Ortiz, a twenty-year police veteran and, for the era, a rare Mexican American lawman.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f4yMZVEZ8otMjWhmhyHjpGJpgbP.jpg", "actors": ["Eugene Buck (Himself)", "Candelario Ortiz (Benito Silva)", "Tom Gardner (Himself)", "Ive White (Himself)", "Bruce Roberts (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
