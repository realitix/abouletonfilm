His conviction is that the abyss between rich and poor can be diminished by good will. The rich B\u00f6r\u00f6cz Horv\u00e1th Kl\u00e1ri returns his love, and also B\u00f6r\u00f6cz Horv\u00e1th is willing to help the poorest family, the Bakos. Bakos J\u00f3ska, who was sent to serve the tough B\u00f6r\u00f6cz Horv\u00e1th as a payment, dies of an infected wound and the people in the village hold the teacher liable as well. Nagy Istv\u00e1n realises, that the abyss cannot be ceased, what is more, it is impassable. He breaks up with his fianc\u00e9e and stands by the side of the poor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qSg4HAJKNI9OVKgQwwevxjrVRCu.jpg", "actors": ["Margit Bara (B\u00f6r\u00f6cz Horv\u00e1th Kl\u00e1ri)", "Sinkovits Imre (Nagy Istv\u00e1n)", "Ferenc Bessenyei ()", "Dajka Margit ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
