This film explores the greatest inter-species friendship on Earth over the course of 40,000 years. Working closely with scientists, we deconstruct the genetic history of your favorite companion and explore how man has consistently re-engineered the dog to adapt to a changing world. An amazing story of how we have taken qualities we cherish from the wolf-loyalty, territory, protection and family-and bred them into a sweet, compliant animal that we call the dog.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7Uyq6S8Zx7PsZ6CKVpjGVpHzufx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
