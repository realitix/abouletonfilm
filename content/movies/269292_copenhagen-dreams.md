A film about the physical surroundings that are part of shaping our lives. About the buildings we wake up in, the front doors we walk out of, the streets we traverse. It is also a film about how the way we live our lives affect our physical surroundings. About places we dream of and the walls onto which we scratch the names our loved ones, before it is too late.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pDrUZzB70FolBPTJZJYY5TlovgJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
