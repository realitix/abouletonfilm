The witch waves her wand causing the bicycle to run backwards. When the cyclist tries to remonstrate, he is turned into a shabby workman, while his bicycle appears high up in the branches of a tree. The witch changes into a young lady who then rides off on the bicycle having brought it down from the tree. The cyclist wakes from his dream and goes on his way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pIXB14EiEdQ3eWcTGOH22MUDBut.jpg", "actors": ["Viking Ringheim (Cyklist)", "Petrine Sonne (Heks)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
