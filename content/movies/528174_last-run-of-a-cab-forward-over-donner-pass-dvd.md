This historic event was captured on film by Albert C. Phelps, with special photography by J. Allen Hawkins and Jacob DeVries. You'll ride in the cab of the AC-powered 10-car train as it climbs the steep grade. Special scenes include 4274's shake-down run in Roseville as it prepares for its final run, rare pacing shots of the train as it races up the Sierra Nevada foothills, and photo run-bys staged for the passengers at remote locations. This is a rare treat for all steam fans to enjoy!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4HblOKTEm89ID6O0OpxjEC6nJyF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
