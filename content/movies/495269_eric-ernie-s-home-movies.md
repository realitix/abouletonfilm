Both Eric and Ernie were avid home movie makers, chronicling their rise to fame and recording key moments in their private and family lives, at home and abroad. Now for the first time, with access to Morecambe & Wise's entire home movie collection, this documentary shows Eric and Ernie at work and at play, on tour and on holiday, from summer season in Blackpool to trying to make it in the USA, from their pre-television fame days to the height of their career.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Eric Morecambe (Himself (Archive Footage))", "Ernie Wise (Himself (Archive Footage))", "Doreen Blythe (Herself (Archive Footage))", "Joan Morecambe (Herself)", "Gail Morecambe (Herself)", "Gary Morecambe (Himself)", "Ken Dodd (Himself)", "Laurie Holloway (Himself)", "Ceri Stennett (Himself)", "Nigel Ellacott (Himself)", "Valerie Spedding (Herself)", "Yvonne Saunderson (Herself)", "Hugh Skinner (Narrator)", "Barry Cryer (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
