But a rare few have something else; soul. It's found in funny places. In the crack of a rusty sill. Down the back of a torn seat next to an old Smartie. And if you're really lucky, it's found in a screaming V12 or perched on a ludicrous wing, or in the rooftop hinge of a gullwing door. These are the cars that make us happy, mad, insane and inevitably very poor. And no matter how much sense is drilled into our daft little heads, we'll continue to love then. So put your feet up, play this DVD and enjoy some of our favourites. It's a celebration of soul.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dZ6z4kpvdScWav5bhRKwjfL9XaQ.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Hammond (Himself)", "Jeremy Clarkson (Himself)", "James May (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
