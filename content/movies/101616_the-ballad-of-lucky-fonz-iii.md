That was also where he performed as Lucky Fonz III for the first time. He returns to the island for a performance at Into the Great Wide Open Festival. \"Lucky Fonz, that's just me without all the boring stuff and with the fun stuff in Technicolor. That's how I see it.\" This contemporary troubadour addresses the joy of singing and what fame means to him: \"Sometimes people ask me whether being famous has bothered me. I tell them I've actually been suffering from a lack of fame for the past 26 years.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pebRzchd5MgUgiot4YlLRfxpUHq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
