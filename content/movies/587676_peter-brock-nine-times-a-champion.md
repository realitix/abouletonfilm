A champion, legend, a true Australian icon. Brock was a rare driving talent, but his skills were never more apparent than at Bathurst each year.  Nine Great Race wins between 1972 and 1987 is a record probably no driver will ever match. This DVD celebrates all of Brock's massive success at Bathurst 1000. This is the very first time that highlights of all of Peter's Bathurst 1000 wins appear on the same DVD.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ohjpSGwbx9IQPdg9PChKBsPfSNo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
