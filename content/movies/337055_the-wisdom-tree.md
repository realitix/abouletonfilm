Confronted with a mysterious car accident, the three must interpret clues that defy common sense. Their collective quest takes them from science to art to music to mysticism in a widening search for answers.  After an intense outward chase to satisfy their rational minds, the trio realizes the answers they desire lie buried deep within themselves. As each seeker begins to embrace the true nature of reality, each is rewarded with revelations beyond their wildest imaginings. What they learn leaves them humbled and in awe of the strange and beautiful universe we call home. When everything makes sense, nothing makes sense.  This highly philosophical narrative has been applauded by scientists, artists, thinkers, scholars, media, academia, students and audiences from 10 to 80+ years old.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8z9qMBWK8GGGTM9ujVhS9IcZLvd.jpg", "actors": ["Sheetal Sheth (Dr. Trisha Rao)", "Patrick Alparone (Steve Hamilton)", "Eric Holter (Mike Parker)", "Nick Scoggin (Eugene Rogers)", "Ross Turner (Dr. Armstrong)", "Shannon Mahoney (Susan Hamilton)", "Jessica Raaum (Debbie Hay)", "Gary Martinez (Dr. McNeese)", "Thomas Cokenias (Ken Miller)", "Rosemary Garrison (Meditating Woman)", "Cristina DelValle (Young Shirley)", "Nicholas Daniel Pauline (Young Steve)", "Monique Bricca (Shelly Richter)", "Billie Shepard (Dr. Catherine Searls)", "Keith Stevenson (Dr. J.
