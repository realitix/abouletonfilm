This film was first broadcast in 2012 as part of a bigger project called \"Growing Up Global\" that has followed ten children, now young adults, from their birth in 1992, mirroring the changes in peoples' lives during this period of globalisation. \"The Girl from Guangzhou\" followed Kay Kay for her whole life, filming with her and her family at regular intervals since her birth in 1992. It gives a rare, personal narrative to the decades of transformation of China during the first 20 years of her lifetime.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4UQQppmCqZYCDZTlo61IbLJIdRG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
