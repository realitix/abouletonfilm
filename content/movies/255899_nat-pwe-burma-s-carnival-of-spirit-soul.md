They are said to possess the power to assist or devastate the lives of those who recognize them. A PWE is a ceremony held to appease a Nat.  Pwes are arranged daily throughout Burma for many purposes including the achievement of success in business, a happy marriage, or improving one's health. A Nat is summoned through a Kadaw; the flamboyant and charismatic master of the Pwe dressed in elegant costume. The Kadaw is a spirit medium, dancer, storyteller, and magician who exposes the crowd to a living incarnation of the Nat brought forth through opening ritual and careful observance of tradition.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sSThenrS8NlmJCW2iID0n7KfYEU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
