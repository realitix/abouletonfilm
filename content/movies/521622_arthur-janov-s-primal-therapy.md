Arthur Janov (1924-2017) was a classic instance of being the right charismatic therapist at the right time - the zeitgeist. Dr. Janov first heard about the embryo to the primal scream through one of his patients when he performed conventional psycho dynamic therapy. It was an absurd theatre performance by Raphael Monta\u00f1ez Ortiz called \"Mommy, Daddy\" presented in London, 1966. The birth of Primal therapy happened when Arthur Janov's book, \"The Primal Scream\" was published early 1970.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r1IKSxHcz8pinBfeqITlKQFT6Ko.jpg", "actors": ["Arthur Janov ()", "Vivian Janov ()", "John La Briola (Chuck Weiss)", "Ken Kesey ()", "John Lennon ()", "Mariselena Guglielmi (The Seeker)", "Raphael Monta\u00f1ez Ort\u00edz ()", "Fritz Perls ()", "R.D.
