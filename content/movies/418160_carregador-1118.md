His legs are a bit crooked; his feet are pretty blistered; his torso is kind of tilted forward. He walks, observes, and wanders around. The others are coming. Someone is already in, and now stands next to him, also wandering. They both pick their work tools, which gets renewed everyday when work is over and their eyes match the state of their feet. Tony is exhausted; yet he somehow celebrated everyday after showering. This documentary portrays him and describes this celebrating version of him. In the everyday life of transported goods, transport workers, and transporters, Consonni and Marques discover a character who turns this film into a testimony of how enticingly overwhelming urban transport can be.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7CupMyisJbEboQxPpnPjCB9S9yz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
