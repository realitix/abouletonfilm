Nesbibe knows that there has to be something more to life, and she finds it\u2014at the movies. As she recalls her childhood and adolescence, her own memories merge with scenes from the dozens of musicals, melodramas and romances she saw to fill her days and to escape the desperation of her home life. But as she moves into adulthood, the contradiction between Nesbibe\u2019s cinematic dream life and everyday reality starts to affect her in unexpected ways. Based on a novel by co-director F\u00fcruzan, My Cinemas avoids sentimentality and movie nostalgia to show how, in its own way, the cinema can become a kind of trap.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bDe4YjkMKxZK0c1XzMPWVeEC5GR.jpg", "actors": ["H\u00fclya Av\u015far (Nesibe)", "Yaman Okay ()", "Sema Aybars ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
