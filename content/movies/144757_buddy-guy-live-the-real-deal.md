This is the first longform video release from the artist, and is his first live recording in over 20 years.  Solid performance by Buddy, recorded at his own club in downtown Chicago. He's backed by the great piano player Johnnie Johnson, and the Saturday Night Live Band featuring a five-piece horn section. Picture and sound quality is fine.
