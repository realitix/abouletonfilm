It\u2019s interesting though for a couple of reasons. First, it was directed by talented Argento protegee Luigi Cozzi, who also directed the superb giallo \u201cThe Killer Must Strike Again\u201d the same year. While this is certainly not Cozzi\u2019s best work, it is surprisingly well-filmed for a sex comedy (even if it does contain some stereotypical fast motion sub-Benny Hill type antics). It also features three of the most sumptuous women from Italian exploitation films of the period\u2013Erica \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Nightmare\u201d Blanc, Daniela \u201cFour Times that Night\u201d Giordano, and the lead, American Irene Miracle (who is most famous for the breast-against-the-glass prison scene in \u201cMidnight Express\u201d,later parodied by Jim Carrey in the ONLY funny scene in \u201cThe Cable Guy\u201d). Blanc plays a lesbian, Giordano plays a hippie, and they both are among the MANY people who try to seduce \u201cthe nude porter\u201d Miracle."}], "recommandations_id": []}
