The musical performance on this disc is the result. It's a little bit minimalism, jazz, rock and classical music presented as a structured jam. This unique interplay of musical genres brings out the talents of these incredible players within the structure of a classical masterpiece. You can choose to view video of the amazing music-making or a \"heavily filtered\" rendition of the HD source footage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x3BMZEVwWrkZAkrAiNv05P4WXVK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
