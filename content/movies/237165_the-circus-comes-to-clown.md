A trumpeting seal holds out a sign reading \"Petrillo Says Two Fish\" (a reference to American Federation of Musicians president James C. Petrillo). The main attraction, a man on a flying trapeze, swoops down into the audience and picks up a beautiful girl. Watch for a cameo appearance by Blackie the Lamb, who kills the man on the flying trapeze at the end.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
