The series rocketed in the ratings as an instant hit - despite the outcry of critics and moralists - who objected to the double-entendres and quasi-sexual hijinks on the show. However, the true behind-the-scenes story of 'Three's Company' will expose a once idyllic workplace that deteriorated into a battleground beset by business dealings, contact disputes, cast rivalries, clashes between producers and network executives and finally, a round of cast replacements which hastened the demise of the show.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gWf9L5vjTBvRzBroYkW1iYWVGGp.jpg", "actors": ["Melanie Paxson (Joyce DeWitt)", "Bret Anthony (John Ritter)", "Jud Tylor (Suzanne Somers)", "Brian Dennehy (Fred Silverman)", "Wallace Langham (Jay)", "Daniel Roebuck (Ted Bergman)", "Michael David Simms (Don Taffner)", "Gregg Binkley (Don Knotts)", "Joyce DeWitt (Herself - Host)", "Christopher Shyer (Alan Hamel)", "Gary Hudson (Tony Thomopolous)", "David Lewis (Ira Denmark)", "Jason Schombing (Jeff Kline)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "tvS-PqWHQiA"}
