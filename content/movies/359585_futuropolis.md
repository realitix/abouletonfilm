Segal also programmed the special effects in the endpart (using Commodore 64). The heroes of futuropolis are Captain Garth, Spud, Liutenant Luna and Cosmo. These four space cadets are sent to investigate series of mutations and destructions of peaceful worlds. The brain behind this chaos is Lord Egghead, the inventor of the \"mutation ray\". Futuropolis is an excellent movie which contains a lot of great animated effects!\" - IMDB", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c97IEmUJ38vArLO7hwjM5f8ONfP.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Campagnoli (Cosmo)", "Mike Cody (Egghead)", "Stan Garth (Captain Garth)", "Catherine Schultz (Lieutenant Luna)", "Cassandra Cossitt (Second Lieutenant)", "Kirk Condyles (Spud)", "Kelly Alder (Extra)", "Denise Aloma (Extra)", "Dave Braken (Extra)", "Mark Copeland (Animation Voiceover (voice))", "Richard Crammer (Extra)", "Jeff Dodge (Extra)", "Lori Edmonston (Extra)", "David Fleck (Extra)", "Matt Fleck (Extra)", "George Garret (Extra)", "David Gipe (Extra)", "Frank Gresham (Extra)", "John Hatch (Extra)", "Hank Hedgecock (Animation Voiceover (voice))", "M.W.
