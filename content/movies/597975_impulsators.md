Like Impulsators, those non-camera films came into being as a result of perforation of film stock, which thus lets through in a desired way the light from the projector, which is in turn \u201cfixed\u201d on the retina and produces after-images. The movement of the film stock generates lively flicker targeted directly at the viewer\u2019s body, above their imagination. Immersed in the trance rhythm, the impulsator becomes a new psychophysical force.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
