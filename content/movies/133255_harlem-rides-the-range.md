The film suffers from its apparent very low budget, but they make the most of it. I was a bit surprised by there stereotypical behavior of the side-kick, but I suppose that it went with the times. \r\n\r\nThe plot is simple and the acting tolerable. Everything appears to have been shot in one take with probably one camera and microphone. Still, if you are interested in early black cinema, this one is worth a watch."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
