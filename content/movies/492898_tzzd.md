What does he dream of? Maybe of being a young Bolivian man, a robot constructor, evolving in a city that seems to have been built by a child with a wild imagination. In his film, Eduardo Williams continues his project of connecting disjointed terrestrial. From Buenos Aires to La Paz, we move from cool to warm colors, from a fruit and vegetable shop to a dark cave where big metal figures are fabricated. Or maybe something else is being made there. Indeed, it is far away in the phantasmagoric woods of Fontainebleau that those metallic experimentations come to life as agile as voguing dancers. In a few minutes, we travel through three countries, two continents and through the bodies it captures, the voices and sounds it registers, it is the entire world manifesting at our senses.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/htAhTG7j7gfiWgQhpQh4QYVY5Yf.jpg", "actors": ["Esteban Quispe ()", "Gisela Elescano ()", "Luis Padron ()", "Alexis \u2018Ipi\u2019 Ayala ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
