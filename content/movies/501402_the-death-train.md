More artful than a Ken Burns-style documentary, this compelling but emotionally draining story is sure to draw praise for its historical value. Ultimately, however, its unrelenting bleakness dulls some of its impact.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
