From the mass immigration of Italians at the end of the 19th century to money laundering on the New York Stock Exchange in 2000, this up-to-date, feature-length production offers a unique perspective on the history of the Mafia as seen through the eyes of an Italian journalist. With newly discovered footage from Italian archives and rare interviews from both sides of the law, Godfathers probes the psychology, the sociology, and the economics behind this powerful yet secretive society. Some of the biggest names in mafia history are introduced, and the ways in which their political savvy helped them orchestrate many of history's major events is explained.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gsh8CRjzfZ95Y7eY2LGQDRPhtid.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
