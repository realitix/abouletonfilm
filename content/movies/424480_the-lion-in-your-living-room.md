L. Junkie", "content": "THE LION IN YOUR LIVING ROOM discusses the biology, history, and evolution of cats. It explores why they behave the way they do, and how their relationship with humans has developed over the centuries. It also shows and discusses cats' relationships with other cats, and how they behave when \"in the wild.\" Veterinarians and researchers discuss what they have uncovered in their experiments and findings.
