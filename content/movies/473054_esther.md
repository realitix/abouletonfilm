To appease his growing displeasure, a plan is agreed upon: a new queen must be found to take Vashti\u2019s place. A massive search spanning the entire empire is finally concluded when a young maiden named Hadassah/Esther (Rebecca Sigwarth), from a race unkindly regarded throughout history, is favored by the King and crowned as the new Queen. In obedience with her cousin Mordecai\u2019s (George Herrig) wishes, she keeps her heritage secret. To what avail? Could it be a tool used in some fashion to thwart the nefarious intents of the evil Haman (Tyson Asbill) bent on destroying her people?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aVBJMODyZw3A6IyUisFb6W1YiRa.jpg", "actors": ["Rebecca Sigwarth (Esther)", "George P.
