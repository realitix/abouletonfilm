A hungry fly stares in through the window, as a bee shows up and tells him he should just go for it. The bee enters and at first intimidates Porky; when Porky finally gets angry enough to try swatting the bee, the bee electrifies the flyswatter. The bee then coaches the fly: with a little help from the trash bin, the fly is soon disguised as a bee himself. But the costume falls off the first time the fly faces Porky, and the fly finds himself on the wrong end of the swatter. The bee returns for a dinner snack, only to find the angry fly wielding the swatter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/inml27BxxeAQjW1xMs1x3kpcT6T.jpg", "actors": ["Mel Blanc (Porky Pig)", "Kent Rogers (James Cagney Bee)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
