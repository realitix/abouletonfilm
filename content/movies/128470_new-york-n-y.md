It is slow, succinct and absolutely riveting. With his photojournalist's eye, and simple but inspired camera work, Depardon plunges us into both the sounds and silences of a day and a night in the city. Further description would be superfluous; what the film doesn't do is as important as what it does. Kudos to distributor Marin Karmitz for resurrecting it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cByuW0sLDqMSM9meSoQKVk6mSL1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [110751, 143944], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
