The premise of the movie is exactly the title and the following fallout.\r\n\r\nI suppose it is body horror, of a sort. Really, it's a strong metaphor about relationships, about love, and about sacrifice. In its runtime of eleven minutes, the movie dances on the line of what will be the last straw before the man who took the skin off of his body for his significant other puts his skin back on and leaves. We see struggles and frustrations.\r\n\r\nIn the end, what the author of the short story, Maria Hummer, and the director, Ben Aston, wanted to say about relationships.\r\n\r\nAll in all, using such an extreme body horror technique to illustrate such a tender metaphor is unique, to say the least."}], "recommandations_id": [241861, 136681, 261899, 209288], "youtube_key": "WkgW64nI3q8"}
