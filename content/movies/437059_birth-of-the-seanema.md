This memory is lost. Or is the memory, which invented new. They said to each other Buzz to give daytime and night vision can listen. They are a girl who becomes a kite. And the men who tear the island on the glass. The girl, who later became Mangpor. Become lost memories become memories fabricated on. In a city that became birds. Stoles back into the infinite ocean.
