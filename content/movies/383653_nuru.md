The story is set in an abandoned zoo. The zoo itself is inspired by the Antwerp Zoo in the nineteenth century and is covered in a mysterious environment reminding of Rene Magritte paintings: The Empire of Light. Under a radiating sunny sky, the landscape is covered in darkness. The opportunistic director of the abandoned zoo instructs a doctor to do some medical experiments on a gorilla, one of the few animals left in the zoo. If the experiment turns out well, the zoo could again become the great attraction it once was.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g1QZWlJ3wvCp7SWyg8Zoxzm6cJT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
