It proposes that present methods of creative production challenge the hierarchy of an authentic or auratic \u2018original\u2019 image. Rather than privileging a primary object, Versions suggests a re-direction for image making, one in which bootlegs, copies and remixes increasingly usurp \u2018originals\u2019 in an age of digital production.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/piiMI2VJrkcJpQClAoM9BSG32Sc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
