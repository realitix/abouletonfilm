Hand-processed and altered images (16mm film) form a labour-intensive, formal questioning of the medium. Female and male masturbation, flowers being taken apart and being put back together, extreme close-up shots of fabric and the practice-kissing of a mirror create a visceral, humorous and tumultuous experience of these personal memories.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fvpWzxpNC0HYQdkRu41aVOD64Fd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
