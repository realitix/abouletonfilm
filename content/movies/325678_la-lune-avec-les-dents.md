He meets up with Noelle, who seems intrigued by his restlessness - until her economist boyfriend shows up. Yet plot details do little to convey the power of the film, which lay in its capturing the anarchic texture of William's life - a life whose lack of direction was read as a rebuke of the Swiss myth of orderliness and self-satisfaction. With his roots in documentary, Soutter excelled at creating a loose, vibrant cinema, full of quick zooms and dynamic hand-held shots, with dialogue that often alternated between outright quotations and stylized interviews.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/spWB5UyBMOa2vA5JHqwggTA64V5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
