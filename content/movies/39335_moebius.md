The subway officials are greatly troubled and so call in topographer Daniel Pratt to help them find it. Unfortunately, the tunnel system is so vast and complex, that Pratt must find his mentor Hugo Mistein for help. Unfortunately, he too has disappeared. Fortunately, he left the system plans behind and as Daniel studies them, he comes to the awful realization that the train, which can be heard but not seen, has somehow become trapped in a fourth dimension. His findings attract the attention of local bureaucrats who are too rigid and pragmatic to accept Pratt's outlandish theory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gRYH1QUumW4pU7Bi7MigMmvQbaW.jpg", "actors": ["Guillermo Angelelli (Daniel Pratt)", "Roberto Carnaghi (Marcos Biasi)", "Annabella Levy (Abril)", "Jorge Petraglia (Mistein)", "Miguel \u00c1ngel Paludi (Aguirre)", "Fernando Llosa (Nazar)", "Mart\u00edn Adjemi\u00e1n (Canotti)", "Daniel Di Biase (Kenn)", "Jean Pierre Reguerraz (Deckes)", "Mart\u00edn Pavlovsky (Conductor 101)", "Felipe M\u00e9ndez (Jefe de Trasbordos)", "Fernando Cia (Figas)", "Osvaldo Santoro (Vega)", "Horacio Roca (Edmundo)", "Nora Zinsky (Profesora)", "Sammy Lerner (Viejito del archivo)", "Rodolfo Franghi (Mussio)", "John Bolster (Ascensorista)", "Jorge Noya (Chofer Unimog)", "Javier Garc\u00eda (Ayudante de Vega)", "Aldo Niebur (Bandoneonista)", "Ricardo Merkin (Maioni)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [278995, 171492, 25530, 102119], "youtube_key": "p3wzNdEGlPw"}
