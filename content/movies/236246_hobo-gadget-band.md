One hobo awakens, and carefully avoids the shower, except for a drop on each eye. He stops at the medicine cabinet for some \"soda fizz\" which jets about, causing havoc. A train goes by, and the swinging rhythm inspires a makeshift clarinet solo. The cook grabs some fish from the fridge, which opens right onto the river. Another train whistle prompts an announcer; the hobos board down a slide. The clarinet player starts up again, and everyone dances. The engineer notices, stops the train, and pulls the \"hobo eliminator\" lever, which ejects them. Fortunately, they land right in front of a sign looking for amateur musicians at a radio station. They play and sing, to everyone's enjoyment. The station owner offers them luxury but a passing train whistle changes their minds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7mekgG1R2CpLogCakLzrag3OcpS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
