The first story, \"Sozinho\", is about a man meeting up with a young woman he met earlier in the day. When he gets to her place, she has a special surprise in store for him. \"Cole\u00e7\u00e3o de Humanos Mortos\" is the second story, and in it a young man is plagued by his inner demons, pushing him to satisfy his desire to inflict pain on others. Finally, in \"06 Tiros, 60ml\" a man wakes up to find himself trapped inside a hospital with blood-soaked faceless monsters and must do what he can to escape, even if that means killing every monster or person he comes across.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yHY3XqIrwphLBgLciWHzOlxPR0P.jpg", "actors": ["Gurcius Gewdner ()", "Fernando Pav\u00e3o ()", "Mara Vanessa Prieto ()", "Tha\u00eds Simi ()", "Nicolas Trevijano ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
