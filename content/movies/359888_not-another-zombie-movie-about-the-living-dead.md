As they join forces with the likes of a pregnant woman, a moronic arms dealer, and a mentally challenged man, they will have to determine which is worse: relying on each other or succumbing to the zombie mayhem. While this uprising of zombies has overwhelmed the city, Mr. Roberts, the CEO of R2 Pharmaceuticals, has sent in a team of mercenaries known as the S.I.E.G.E into Cyrene City to recover the only known antidote for his own financial gain. Not Another Zombie Movie... About the Living Dead is a hilarious twisted tale about survival versus morality during a zombie apocalypse. Watch as these survivors discover there is no such thing as a hero when zombies are trying to eat your face off.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fcCjnveJ3kv46eKib3yZg7vlz9i.jpg", "actors": ["Jay Davis ()", "Harold Dennis ()", "Will Cummings III ()", "Cal Evans ()", "Jackie Dallas ()", "Steven James Price ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
