So much going on: the king of the scrapyard's 'Nam ptsd, the night of the living dead-esque sex scene, the bizarre game of piggy in the middle with a severed penis, the sleaziness of the junkyard owner and how far he goes with it, the gruesome death scenes, the vicious cop. It's so rad and is topped with surprisingly good cinematography and a fair bit of social commentary. It's like Troma via Robert Crumb and a bit of 42nd street grindhouse. \r\n\r\nHighly recommended to all fans of Troma, melt movies, sleaze and splatter!"}], "recommandations_id": [27274, 27813, 27814, 14510]}
