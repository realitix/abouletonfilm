The story is a bunch of antics that go on in a diner/restaurant (they used to call a \"beanery\") and in the kitchen as Bobby and his dog help out. Some of the gags are excellent. The dog is a riot.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
