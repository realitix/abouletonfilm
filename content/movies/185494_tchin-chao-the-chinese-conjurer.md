A fan becomes a parasol, lanterns appear and disappear. The conjurer spins the open parasol in front of himself, and a dog leaps out from behind it. The dog becomes a woman, then a masked man appears. The conjurer sits them each on a box a few feet apart: suddenly the woman and man have changed places. The disappearing and the transfers continue in front of a simple backdrop.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/UKF9eO8FUsho8n8S222TBUzdNm.jpg", "actors": ["Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [49298, 44330, 188069, 44324], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
