Rancher Ann Keith and her cowhands, who have read and laughed at Pike's \"wild\" west, decide to give him a shock impression that is even wilder than depicted in his imaginative literary flights. Gang leader \"Killer\" Madden and his bandits decide to make the staged robberies real ones and Pike is arrested for the crimes Madden has pulled.
