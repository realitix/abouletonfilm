The destiny of Tomoe Shiro, a formidable racer with a very promising career, experiments an U-turn when a serious accident puts his life at stake. He recovers miraculously, though, when his heart is replaced with the engine of his own racing car. However, because of that very reason, race regulations demote him to the category of a mere mechanical part of the vehicle and is deprived from the right to participate as a pilot in regular races. Only in a far away colonial planet, along with a multitude of other charismatic pilots also vetoed from participating in regular competitions, he will be given the opportunity to race for his pride and the money of the prize. And so this exciting rally starts!!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/41FU32RPNo3B9PUkuGkIbe0U6op.jpg", "actors": ["Hatano Wataru (Shiro Tomoe)", "Kenta Miyake (Good Speed)", "Ryusuke Ohbayashi (Loser King)", "Ryoka Yuzuki (Tomoe Mikagura (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "AuU2f3fGiRY"}
