Without any previous research, characters, locations or established themes, a film crew arrives at the Paraiba backlands in search of people with stories to tell. In the town of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o do Rio Peixe, they discover the Ara\u00e7\u00e1s Farm, a rural community where 86 families live, the majority connected by family ties. Thanks to the mediation of a young woman from Ara\u00e7\u00e1s, the residents \u2013 consisting mostly of elderly people \u2013 tell their life stories, marked by popular Catholicism, hierarchy, a sense of family and honor.
