Water became more precious than gold. Now in 2005, settlers are coming back, meeting new challenges, and age-old adversaries. A U.S. Marshal and his cyborg partner patrol the American West. A hard-as-nails female boss heads two U.S. Marshals (one human, one bionic) in Badlands 2005, a concept where the near future sees water as a more precious commodity than gold. The West of America has been deserted after droughts a decade earlier, and now a re-population program is underway.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mOFhuiF5RzDFTv7sIkxKsJcFF0o.jpg", "actors": ["Lewis Smith (Marshal Garson MacBeth)", "Miguel Ferrer (Rex)", "Sharon Stone (Alex Neil)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
