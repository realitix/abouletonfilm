Lui et ses hommes montent une embuscade et rep\u00e8rent le tueur, mais celui-ci parvient \u00e0 s'enfuir. Will le prend en chasse mais le perd de vue dans l'opaque brouillard. Il voit une ombre qui pointe une arme \u00e0 feu et tire. Lorsqu'il s'approche du corps, il d\u00e9couvre qu'il vient de tuer Hap, son partenaire. Instinctivement, il prend le pistolet qu'a auparavant laiss\u00e9 tomber le tueur dans sa fuite et le place pr\u00e8s de Hap pour dissimuler sa culpabilit\u00e9. Walter Finch, le meurtrier, a vu faire Will. Il le menace de le d\u00e9noncer s'il ne ferme pas rapidement le dossier en accusant l'ancien petit ami de la victime d'\u00eatre responsable des deux meurtres. Will ne peut laisser Walter s'en tirer aussi facilement. Cependant, l'absence de sommeil l'emp\u00eache d'avoir les id\u00e9es claires.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zb0D3vfjcPFvuyHp1mFPOIcYJWH.jpg", "actors": ["Al Pacino (Will Dormer)", "Robin Williams (Walter Finch)", "Hilary Swank (Ellie Burr)", "Maura Tierney (Rachel Clement)", "Martin Donovan (Hap Eckhart)", "Nicky Katt (Fred Duggar)", "Paul Dooley (Chief Nyback)", "Crystal Lowe (Kay Connell)", "Jay Brazeau (Francis)", "Larry Holden (Farrell)", "Kerry Sandomirsky (Trish Eckhart)", "Lorne Cardinal (Rich)", "Katharine Isabelle (Tanya Francke)", "Jonathan Jackson (Randy Stetz)", "Paula Shaw (Coroner)", "Oliver 'Ole' Zemen (Pilot)", "James Hutson (Officer #1)", "Andrew Campbell (Officer #2)", "Tasha Simms (Mrs. Connell)", "Malcolm Boddington (Principal)", "Chris Gauthier (Uniformed Officer)", "Ian Tracey (Warfield (voice))", "Kate Robbins (Woman on the Road)", "Emily Perkins (Girl at Funeral)", "Dean Wray (Ticket Taker)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "talisencrw", "content": "Definitely not Nolan's best but probably my favourite (at least tied with 'Batman Begins') because I love the Norwegian original so much AND the subtle changes Nolan made with it, as well as what the three stars (Al Pacino, Robin Williams--in his first villainous role, I believe, and Hilary Swank--in probably my favourite performance of hers, next to the downright decadence and naughtiness she displayed in 'The Black Dahlia') bring to the table here. I greatly enjoyed the five short extras on my DVD (a double-sided disc I bought years ago that has 'The Devil's Advocate' on the other side, yet unwatched): a conversation/interview of Nolan with Pacino; 'Day for Night: The Making of...'; 'In the Fog' (which interviewed cinematographer Wally Pfister); Nathan Crowley: production designer; and 'Eyes Wide Open' (which interviewed sleep disturbance experts), which thankfully I viewed before I watched the movie, to enhance my experience.\r\n\r\nGreatly recommended to fans of contemporary crime thrillers, regardless of whether you watched the Norwegian original or not. There are enough differences to still make it worth your while as a cinephile."}, {"pseudo": "Gimly", "content": "Captures some human sentiment incredibly well, coupled with the unique setting and great acting, this makes Insomnia a good watch, worth every minute of its two hour runtime.\r\n\r\nThat said, I was not as enamoured by it as others might be. Perhaps if was unaware of what Nolan, Pacino or Williams are capable of at their highest levels, or if I didn't realise five minutes before the end that I'd actually seen it as a kid and could exclusively remember the ending, then it would have had a higher impact on me.\r\n\r\nBut even taken for me as is, _Insomnia_ is still a very solid bit of filmmaking.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I personally recommend you give it a go._"}], "recommandations_id": [9008, 322, 949, 11660], "youtube_key": "V8Vu7Zre7h8"}
