Her apparent \"normalcy,\" however, makes her something of a misfit in her family, made up as it is by a group of outrageous performers. Audrey's parents were funk/ R&amp; B stars in the 1970s, while her brother currently reigns supreme on the hip hop and fashion scene, and her precocious little sister is a streetsmart MC in the manner of Lil' Kim. Audrey finds this family tree a little embarrassing, and is somewhat disdainful of the ego and trappings of pop culture entertainment, so she hides her clan from her new boyfriend. This unfortunately becomes a bit difficult to maintain when the family shows up for a visit. The campus will never be the same again!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
