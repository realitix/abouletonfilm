The play's main role of Geesche is played by Annick. But what does it mean to make a fictional character come to life when that character is so close to one's own experiences ? A number of questions arise concerning the impact of Geesche's story on the intimate and collective life of the actors and actresses involved in the play. Annick, Georges, Jean-Pascal, Jean-Paul, Anne, Nordine, Felix, Stephane and Marie-Pierre question how their real lives overlap with their theatrical roles. These questions eventually develop into a common reflection on how psychiatry, patriarchal violence and social constructions are ultimately interwoven.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i9ntnl6AxCu7VHvVvtaZHi9RLXJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
