The Host sets out on its own exploration, to decipher signs from the fragmented images buried in the BP archive. This journey through the past interweaves a number of stories drawn from both personal memory and the records of an imperial history, which builds a picture of a 20th-century colonial encounter. The Host is a personal essay film about the stories we tell about ourselves and others, the facts and fictions we live by, and their consequences. Followed by a discussion with Miranda Pennell.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qqEpczHJfvSH2mgglMqvsw41VBH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
