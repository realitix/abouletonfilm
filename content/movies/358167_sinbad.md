They crew spot an uncharted island, which Sinbad encourages the Captain to approach, hoping that it holds untold riches. Sinbad, Habeeb and two other sailors take a rowboat to the island, which has a strange appearance: it is flat and bare, with no grass, trees or sand. The island shakes violently, and the two sailors return to Captain Aziz's ship, leaving Sinbad and Habeeb behind. The island reveals itself to be the fin of a gigantic sea monster, which swims away. Captain Aziz's ship leaves as well, leaving Sinbad and Habeeb stranded in the middle of the ocean.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gBBqgnbM381pd1Q4RkX2mVqnynv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
