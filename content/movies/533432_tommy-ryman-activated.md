This XY equation evidently equals: acclaimed comedian.\u00a0 Ryman has earned the title of Semifinalist on NBC\u2019s Last Comic Standing. Roseanne Barr, a professed fan, raves she has \u201cnever seen anything like Tommy before in her whole life, he is one-of-a-kind, fantastic!\u201d Ryman also recently won the title of Best of the Midwest at the prestigious Gilda\u2019s Laugh Fest. Ryman\u2019s act can be described as absurdist and clever, masked behind a very likable and innocent demeanor, often thought of as awkwardly charming. He is a favorite among audiences at top clubs, corporates, and colleges around the nation.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
