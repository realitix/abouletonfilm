Cutting, for Leonardi, is the most decisive aesthetic device. The result is a wonderfully composed furioso of pictures. The hand-held camera catches rehearsals, conversations without sound, bits of theatre and daily life actions (which, for Living Theatre people, is very often intermixed).", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Julian Beck ()", "Judith Malina ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
