Parts of the recording project were caught on video by independent filmmakers Aaron, Seth, and Justin Howland, three brothers more formally known as 7 Fluid Oz. Productions. With just a little rough footage, On the Way had its start. Following the release of Ten Thousand Mornings, the Howlands spent nine months capturing Peter's engaging and dynamic above-ground performances at venues in and around Boston, including the beautiful 800-seat Somerville Theatre and the intimate Club Passim in Harvard Square.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rh0fpmdQ0eDP2KV1FdpQANUEZcf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
