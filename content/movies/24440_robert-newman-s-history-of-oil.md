This innovative history programme is based around Robert Newman's stand-up act and supported by resourceful archive sequences and stills with satirical impersonations of historical figures from Mayan priests to Archduke Ferdinand.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pBKlJds7E8KoyqFa4iYoTG1XgUg.png", "actors": ["Rob Newman (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
