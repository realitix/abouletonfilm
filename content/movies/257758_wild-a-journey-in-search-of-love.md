He lives in a small town with his grandmother. He finds himself head over heels with the queen of his class, Renanit, but is too shy and self conscious to approach her. Like Candide and Don Quixote did, he sets out on a soul searching journey: to conquer the world and screw - to become a man. His imminent military service puts Wild on a deadline so he works to maximize his experiences in the short time available.
