[has] been hailed as [a] classic of the new wave. [The tape] juxtaposes fragments from a soap opera with sequences of ice skating races. The graceful movements of the skaters punctuate repeated excerpts from a dreadfully intense discussion between a doctor and his patient: \u2018He doesn't do anything, doesn't say anything.... It's just the way he looks at me.... That sound crazy?\u2019 The narrative builds up slowly as a few more words of the deadly dialogue are released. Extended in this way, the pathos is bare, the narrative content becomes meaningless and the result is particularly moving.\" --Katherine Elwes, Performance (July/August 1981)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hNYMpZUySHVtkpJ46Z1JYx2UcbM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
