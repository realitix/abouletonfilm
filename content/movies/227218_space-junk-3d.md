SPACE JUNK is a visually explosive journey of discovery that weighs the solutions aimed at restoring our planet\u2019s orbits.  Experience mind-boggling collisions, both natural and man-made. Soar for the stunning depths of Meteor Crater to an unprecedented view of our increasingly crowded orbits \u2013 22,000 miles above earth. Join us as foremost expert Don Kessler, the \u201cFather of Space Junk,\u201d guides us through the challenges we face in protecting them, forging a new age of space discovery.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/73D15rql6270KT2gUWO3ThLH4KM.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Wilkinson (Narrator)", "Em Clark (Child at Telescope #2)", "Zach Clark (Child at Telescope #1)", "Kelby Cross (Space Command Analyst #1)", "Howard Henley (Scientist)", "John Sullivan (Helicopter Pilot)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [356021, 512926, 93018], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
