The film depicts, in a kind of fictional documentary, the 1896 Hamburg dockworkers' strike: the workers receive meagre wages for hard work and live under miserable conditions and finally go on strike (to make matters more personal, one of the strikers has a brother who is a policeman). Even though the inspiration for the story was an event that took place in the XIX century, things had little changed by the troublesome twenties so the story had a perfect contemporary ring.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sPT056BDA8eY8Vupn4XiHy3VCcW.jpg", "actors": ["Gyula Balogh (Sohn)", "Ilse Berger ()", "Erna Schumacher (Die alte Mutter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
