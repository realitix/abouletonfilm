I then backed up the film to beginning and re-exposed the film from another angle. I passed my hand in front of the lens during the second exposure to blend the two images together. The sound for this film was created from industrial sounds I recorded also in the same area and manipulated with effects.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
