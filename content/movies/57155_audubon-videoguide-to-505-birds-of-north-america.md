Beautiful moving footage and stills, bird calls and sounds, annotated visuals, authoritative narration and range maps help users quickly and precisely locate any of 247 bird species in DVD I (with 258 additional species in DVD II, available seperately) at the touch of a button. By using your DVD player's remote control you can repeat a segment, a shot or any part of a bird's description as often as you like, or even view footage in slow motion. Add a portable DVD player or a laptop and you can easily bring this unique reference into the field, for immediate on-site identification.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
