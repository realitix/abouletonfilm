How could one of the world's most beloved comic talents have such a morbidly distorted opinion of himself? In this documentary, interviews with such friends, fans, and colleagues as Raquel Welch, Yul Brenner, Spike Milligan, Laurence Harvey, and others reveal the true personality behind the man who was loved by everyone, but still viewed himself as entirely alone.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/feQDRawx86OlZqooJYiX6J2gvPO.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Sellers ()", "Raquel Welch ()", "Kenneth Tynan ()", "Yul Brynner ()", "Graham Stark ()", "Ringo Starr ()", "Laurence Harvey ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
