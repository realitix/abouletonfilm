Highly professional production with two of the best performances I've ever witnessed in any opera. By the end of the third act I was crying and by the end of the fourth act I could not stop the tears. These two can not only sing up a storm they act one as well. This is the best Manon Lescaut I've ever seen and hope the upcoming one at the Met is as good. It truly was thrilling. Kaufmann and Opolais were unbelievably fantastic and the orchestra was superb. Pappano is the kind of maestro you want to sing for as he coaches as in the old days of maestros like Levine, etc. This is highly recommended as a keeper!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8SU2Kf8IPUDu80IPUV6b5E3AveR.jpg", "actors": ["Kristine Opolais (Manon Lescaut)", "Jonas Kaufmann (Des Grieux)", "Christopher Maltman (Lescaut)", "Maurizio Muraro (Geronte)", "Benjamin Hulett (Edmondo)", "Nigel Cliffe (L\u2019Oste)", "Nadezhda Karayazina (Il Maestro di Ballo)", "Robert Burt (Un Musico)", "Antonio Pappano (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
