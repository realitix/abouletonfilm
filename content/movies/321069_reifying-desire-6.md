Combining his own performance (drawn from \u2018voguing\u2019 and martial arts) with video, 3D animation and fantastical sculpture, Satterwhite blurs the boundaries between the life of the mind, the world of the images and the physical realm of bodies and objects. Within his videos, Satterwhite incorporates his mother\u2019s drawings (diagrams for inventions and text exploring consumer culture medicine, sex, astrology, and philosophy) bringing their lines to life and intimately incorporating them in to his world. Reifying Desire 6 was shown at the Whitney Biennial 2014.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/duq7kuLvMIgIHY8iRpSMUJte4IF.jpg", "actors": ["Jacolby Satterwhite ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
