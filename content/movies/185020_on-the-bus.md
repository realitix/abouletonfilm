Add a trip to Burning Man - a festival of radical self-expression in the desert - and you get this self-aware documentary. What begins as the pilot of a reality-based internet program evolves into a longer project delving beyond the apparent stereotypes of its cast: young porn star, Jason; sexy actor-slash-waiter, Charles; brash Swedish Olympic diver, JMY; witty music composer, Damon; plus the project's permissive producer, Billy, and its at times frustrated young director, Lance. As addictive as your favorite reality TV show, but addressing much deeper questions, this is a trip you won't want to miss", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cnBTfLCzLXo1McLUj7owK91Hwme.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
