An unseen narrator guides us through the story, describing how he unearthed a pile of letters and fragments of a novel in an abandoned trailer in the countryside. Slowly, these fragments come to life, revealing how the writer's paranoid fantasies provoke a psychological meltdown.Exploring a number of contemporary concerns - the media, modern art, digitalisation, modernism, ecology - the film experiments with filmic genres and uses image and sound to mirror the writer's descent into madness.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Nicola Walker ()", "Barney Kaye ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
