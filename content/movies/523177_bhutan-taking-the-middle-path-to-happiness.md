Imagine a people who see all life as sacred and the source of their happiness, a place with an abundance of clean and renewable energy, a nation committed to preserving its culture and whose progress is measured by obtaining Gross National Happiness for its people. Where is this Shangri-La? Bhutan. But can a place like Bhutan really exist? Can such ideals be realized? Can this small, geographically isolated country tucked away in the Himalayans truly protect its environment and culture as they open their doors to the West? The answer is rooted in the Bhutanese view of the world, anchored in Buddhism, with the simple message that happiness can only be found by taking the middle path the path that balances the needs of man with the powerful spirits of nature.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4CXR16E7g08Bflnc5BmiG3fcFOp.jpg", "actors": ["Ann Mortifee (Narrator)", "Paul Horn ()", "Christopher Hedge ()", "Jigme Drukpa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
