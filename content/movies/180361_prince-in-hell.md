A 2nd plot line is concerned with Micha's young son Sascha, and his life in a rundown world of drugs and poverty. His fascination with the creepy, exhibitionist puppeteer Firlefanz, whose grotesque puppets enact a gay fairy tale paralleling the relationship of Stefan and Jockel. Central to the disintegration of these characters is the drug dealer Ingolf, who 'pulls their strings' with heroin, instead of puppet wires.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/erzedlhT6tWTGuGoshSq10bKpNd.jpg", "actors": ["Stefan Laarmann (Stefan)", "Michael Stock (Jockel)", "Wolfram Haack (Firlefanz)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
