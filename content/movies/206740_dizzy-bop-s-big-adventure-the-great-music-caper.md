Characters come and go, show up out of nowhere, disappear, come back. Attempts to provide context only serve to get in the way of the adventure itself. The rivalries between instruments make it seem like nobody really likes anyone very much, even on good days.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, despite the flaws, most kids will understand that what's at stake here is saving music from those who wish to silence the world of it. Also, since it's about music, there's ample opportunity for young kids to learn about the different instruments in an orchestra and the sounds that they make. This alone makes it worthwhile for families interested in music, even if the story is hard to follow at time.  [Common Sense Media]"}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
