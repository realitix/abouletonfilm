It's a collection of stories on the choices we make and the paths we ultimately decide to follow. And - most importantly - whether or not that path is truly connected to who we are as individuals. First-time director and Wilmington native Grant Peelle narrates the film from the perspective of a fledgling filmmaker acting on his long-held passion to make movies. Together with four other crew members and a trusty van, Peelle takes the audience on a 42 day, 10,000 mile road trip to capture stories of complacency and triumph from all across the country.
