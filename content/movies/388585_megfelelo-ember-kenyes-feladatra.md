Once on the jury, the young bureaucrat starts looking into the past himself and gets embroiled in a labyrinth. The past may well be unclear because recent leaders have certain facts that need to be kept buried. Filmmaker Janos Kovacsi borrows characteristics from revolutions in the Eastern European block (1950s-1980s) to create this post-revolutionary society with an idealist commander (Ferenc Zenthe) meant to lead them. A clue as to what happens next lies in the opening scene -- the funeral of the commander who has given his life for his cause. Ironically, Kovacsi undoubtedly faced censorship on this film. That would not only account for some uneven narration, but it adds a dimension of reality to the topic at hand.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Ottilia Borb\u00e1th (a Rend\u00f5rf\u00f5n\u00f6k titk\u00e1rn\u00f5je)", "Istv\u00e1n Boz\u00f3ky (Minister)", "S\u00e1ndor Eszes (\u00f5r)", "Anna Feh\u00e9r (M., fiatal n\u00f5)", "S\u00e1ndor Halm\u00e1gyi (A nyilv\u00e1ntart\u00e1s f\u00f5n\u00f6ke)", "Enik\u0151 Eszenyi (\u00e1pol\u00f3n\u0151)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
