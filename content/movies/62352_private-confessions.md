Guilt-ridden wife Anna (Pernilla August) divulges an extramarital affair to a priest, her uncle Jacob (Max von Sydow). He presses her to confess her sins to her husband, Henrik. As the film moves back and forth in time, the notion of truth is tested. Tomas, the lover, and Henrik will find that Anna's confessions do not absolve anyone, and have the power to inflict more pain.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xtBKBFGZBh2qYzv16WErTnjdd3x.jpg", "actors": ["Pernilla August (Anna)", "Max von Sydow (Jacob)", "Samuel Fr\u00f6ler (Henrik)", "Anita Bj\u00f6rk (Karin \u00c5kerblom)", "Thomas Hanzon (Tomas Egerman)", "Gunnel Fred (M\u00e4rta G\u00e4rdsj\u00f6)", "Hans Alfredson (Biskop Agrell)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [3097, 8468, 23522, 41647], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
