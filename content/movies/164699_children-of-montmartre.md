Rose gives each child loving attention, and soon she's their favorite. An especially needy child is Marie, a prostitute's daughter. Rose and she bond, and Marie is jealous of all attentions paid Rose, especially those of Dr. Libois, the school's physician. When Rose inadvertently guides the children through the educational experiment of a visiting scholar, and then discloses she has a college degree and is working beneath her station, the principal wants to fire her. Is there any way she can stay? And what will happen to Marie?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aPzTAq7aTSyPhn1adYklYUqd4JE.jpg", "actors": ["Madeleine Renaud (Rose)", "Alice Tissot (Superintendent)", "Paulette \u00c9lambert (Marie Coeuret)", "Sylvette Fillacier (Mme.
