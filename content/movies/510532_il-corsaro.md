Chronologically speaking, it belongs to the famous \"years in the galley\", even though it dates from a period (the autumn of 1848) when the composer's name, in Italy, could already be considered established. Although this is considered one of Verdi's minor works, there are many exciting and poignant passages in it, and the tight dramatic action makes for music that has a pressing and incisive rhythm. The renowned baritone Renato Bruson and conductor Renato Palumbo stand out in the cast. The video recording makes the most of Lamberto Puggelli's beautiful sets.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wq6nflO8ovP6I8odYsOm5Lfo98L.jpg", "actors": ["Zvetan Michailov ()", "Renato Bruson ()", "Michela Sburlati ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
