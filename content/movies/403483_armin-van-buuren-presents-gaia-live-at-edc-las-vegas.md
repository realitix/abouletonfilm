They both wear a heavy hooded costume and there is virtually no fan interaction whatsoever for the entirety of the set. The focus during a Gaia set is always on the music, and that's the way it should be. If you like hard pounding trance without the gimmicks, then watching Gaia perform is a no brainer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ll7QzTlL8Z1qOzDDUQO9nT0UYXh.jpg", "actors": ["Armin van Buuren (Armin van Buuren)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "clvetMzQEDY"}
