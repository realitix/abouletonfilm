With nothing comparable surrounding it, the beautifully shaped Mount Fuji towers in splendid isolation and has become the symbol of Japan.  But do you know the real beauty of Mount Fuji?  NHK knows Mt. Fuji as well as anyone.  Masterfully capturing Mt. Fuji in high-definition, this program presents Mt. Fuji as a splendid visual poem.  Sheathed in orange, red, brown, blue, white, black and sometimes shimmering like a diamond, Mt. Fuji shows her many faces, which change with the time of day, season and weather.  In this program, you will see and enjoy Mt. Fuji as you never have before.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l6Xjz8TodQMUBOzAX4ufcsS8uQQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
