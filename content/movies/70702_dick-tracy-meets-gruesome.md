When Gruesome accidentally inhales some of the gas and passes out, the police think he is dead and take him to the morgue, where he later revives and escapes. This puzzling incident attracts the interest of Dick Tracy, and when the criminals later use the gas to rob a bank, Tracy realizes that he must devote his entire attention to stopping them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bXzulCZ3nOUPEkdojBgoWJPIy28.jpg", "actors": ["Boris Karloff (Gruesome)", "Ralph Byrd (Dick Tracy)", "Anne Gwynne (Tess Trueheart)", "Edward Ashley (Dr. L.
