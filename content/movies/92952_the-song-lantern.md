His act of cruelty compels his father to disown him, leading the once promising actor to a life on the streets. But his desire to win back the respect of his father and the affection of the dead actor's daughter pushes him toward a more noble existence. Naruse employed a delicately structured mise-en-scene in this family melodrama, which evokes the work of Josef von Sternberg.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rvykHkUYQMzp5jewAT3VtcMz2Y1.jpg", "actors": ["Sh\u00f4tar\u00f4 Hanayagi (Onchi Kitahachi)", "Eijir\u00f4 Yanagi (Jirozou)", "Ichijir\u00f4 Oya (Onchi Genjiro)", "Kan Ishii (Henmi Sessou)", "Isuzu Yamada (O-Sode)", "Eiichi Seto (Gen-ichi)", "Masao Murata (Muneyama)", "Tamae Kiyokawa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
