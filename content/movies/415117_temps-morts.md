Young director Claude Godard (unrelated to Jean-Luc) has eschewed dialogue, music, and commentary. What remains are some startling, unsettling, and sometimes nearly morbid images of the elderly in various stages of aging, each waiting for death in his or her own way.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
