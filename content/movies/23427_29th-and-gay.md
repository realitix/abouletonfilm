While his best friend Roxy, an actress-turned-activist, struggles with showing him there's life beyond the glitz of the disco ball, his other friend, Brandon, one of those gay boys comfortable in his own gay skin, works on getting James to at least talk to a boy. Feeling out of place in the world of circuit boys, caught between his Hispanic-American heritage and being gay, we watch James find his place in the world, realizing that life is in the journey, not the destination.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rzL6OPlLgXl32Z959Z4DeREcfJJ.jpg", "actors": ["James Vasquez (James Sanchez (as James V\u00e1squez))", "Nicole Marcks (Roxy Hymen)", "David McBean (Brandon Bouvier)", "Mike Doyle (Andy Griffith)", "Annie Hinton (Mom)", "Michael Emerson (Gorilla)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
