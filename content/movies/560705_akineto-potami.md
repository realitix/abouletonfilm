It\u2019s a long process to adapt, especially for Anna, since Petros is quite occupied with his job. That will cause a conflict between them and inevitably the couple is distanced. Everything is escalated as for the past period there is no sexual intercourse between them. This slow-paced decay is intensified when an unexpected event occurs, changing everything between them. Balancing between trust and disbelief the haunting suspense evolves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/axr1vlhkMFuPEFDOX7mRzlqO4PG.jpg", "actors": ["Katia Goulioni (Anna)", "Andreas Konstantinou (Petros)", "Indra Burkovska (Teacher)", "Juris Bartkevi\u010ds (Chairman)", "Ivars Puga (Matthias)", "Guna Zari\u0146a (Psychiatrist)", "Katrine Pasternaka (Valentina)", "Oskars Morozovs (Private Investigator)", "Glebs Beikov (Ivan)", "Kaspars Znoti\u0146\u0161 (Louis)", "Leon\u012bds Lencs (Sergei)", "Kirill Zaytsev (Leonid Burzak)", "Kirill Bolsev (Sasha)", "Irina Jegorova (Sasha's Aunt)", "Marks Selutko (Interpreter)", "Reg\u012bna Razuma (Amelia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
