He is a cop who doesn't take it easy when the mob executes his stripper-sister, and he goes after them to get revenge at all costs. Another Phillipino superstar, Jim Gaines, has a small cameo in \"Mad Dog II\" as a snitch who gets offed in the bathroom.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7KdXYVRpS7nK3vRj4Y2WJQNYYqg.jpg", "actors": ["Romano Kristoff ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
