A love letter to a staple ingredient in global cuisine and the people that keep the industry going, The Golden Harvest includes a revelatory exploration into the evolving environments, societies and demographics of the European and Middle Eastern regions where the tree resides. Bringing to the the surface the rarely discussed cultural and environmental costs involved with the production of the tree's prize oil, the film expertly balances its documentarian aspects with its unbridled love for the tree and its history. Featuring a diverse range of interviews from those who know and love the olive tree, Yunis' doc is a lovingly crafted tribute that is not to be missed.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
