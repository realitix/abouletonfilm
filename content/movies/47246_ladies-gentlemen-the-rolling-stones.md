In 1972, the Stones bring their Exile on Main Street tour to Texas: 15 songs, with five from the \"Exile\" album. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts, and Bill Wyman on a small stage with three other musicians. Until the lights come up near the end, we see the Stones against a black background. The camera stays mostly on Jagger, with a few shots of Taylor. Richards is on screen for his duets and for some guitar work on the final two songs. It's music from start to finish: hard rock (\"All Down the Line\"), the blues (\"Love in Vain\" and \"Midnight Rambler\"), a tribute to Chuck Berry (\"Bye Bye Johnny\"), and no \"Satisfaction.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mpPuWqALdCGF0gz8LhHfD71fJBS.jpg", "actors": ["Mick Jagger (Himself)", "Charlie Watts (Himself)", "Bill Wyman (Himself)", "Mick Taylor (Himself)", "Nicky Hopkins (Himself (Pianist))", "Bobby Keys (Himself (Saxophonist, Percussionist))", "Jim Price (Himself (Trumpeter, Trombonist))", "Ian Steward (Himself (Roadie))", "Keith Richards (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "P10LVJeVKKo"}
