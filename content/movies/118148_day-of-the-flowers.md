Arriving in Havana, the two women promptly lose the ashes and go through a series of misadventrues - both romantic and dangerous - to try to retrieve them. A colourful and wryly humourous tale of cross-cultural misunderstandings and lost illusions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h0vhzATuJeaMB96pFVBlRjCXKQ1.jpg", "actors": ["Eva Birthistle (Rosa)", "Charity Wakefield (Ailie)", "Carlos Acosta (Tomas)", "Bryan Dick (Conway)", "Christopher Simpson (Ernesto)", "Manuel de Blas (Ignatio Palma)", "Luis Alberto Garc\u00eda (Ernesto's Cousin - Camilo)", "Aurora Basnuevo (Matilde)", "Phyllis Logan (Brenda)", "Olivia Poulet (Lucy)", "Robert Fitch (Bob)", "Daniel Weyman (Martin)", "Lizzie Hopley (Harriet)", "Ken Drury (Cliff)", "Tommy Jessop (John)", "Hannah Donaldson (Jo)", "Fraser Johnston (Ewan)", "Ioannis Douglas Pennant (Policeman)", "Edenis S\u00e1nchez (Yemeli)", "Alannis De La Cortera (Lesvia)", "Enrique Molina (Jorge)", "El Chacal (Himself)", "Alennys Mandez (Carmen)", "Jorge Luis Lopez (Immigration Officer)", "Ulik Aniello (Customs Officer)", "Edwin Fern\u00e1ndez (Policeman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [110671, 64811, 85246, 83147], "youtube_key": "cVYmJ56qxNQ"}
