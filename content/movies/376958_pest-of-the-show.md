Two alley cats, looking over a fence, see Champ in his attire and begin razzing him. Champ does a slow turn and starts after the cats and, in no time, the studio is a shambles. Doc sees an announcement of a dog show, the winner of which receives a $50,000 prize and a banquet. Desperately in need of money, Doc gets the idea of entering Champ in the upcoming show and begins grooming him. Doc gives Champ a bath, lessons in proper speech, walking with books balanced on head, and the proper attire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lqTec7F9jShYaYDIyW7MU0cE57L.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Frees (Doc (voice))", "Dal McKennon (Various (voice) (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
