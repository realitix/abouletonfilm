Taking a step in front of the camera, however, Endo offers a very different kind of encounter in this inspiring self-portrait. \"Mother, I've Pretty Much Forgotten Your Face\" follows the artist, a native of Nihonmatsu, Fukushima, on the 2011 nationwide solo tour celebrating his 60th birthday, which was interrupted by the Great East Japan Earthquake. Traveling, performing and talking with fellow musicians and activists, Endo reflects on the past and future of Fukushima, the legacy of Hiroshima, his upbringing and his feelings about his mother, communicated in the song from which the documentary is named.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wYu4ANFpTY2D9FGA4j10NulKmyg.jpg", "actors": ["Michiro Endo ()", "Mizuki Misumi ()", "Takao Morishima ()", "Pistol Takehara ()", "Otomo Yoshihide ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
