When she leaves the group to pursue a career as a film actress, he gives her a small figure as a keepsake, a symbol of traditional theatre. He tells her to return it only when she is certain she wants to stay in film. The dancer\u2019s independence in choosing to become a film actress breaks with cultural tradition, as does Sein Lin\u2019s performance in a jazz club, symbolising the colonial influence. Winner of Best Director at the Burmese Academy Awards in 1971.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/th9WINKbRFLv80dBU8zFCgG41y0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
