But without sex bomb Amy Yip, coarse humour or lesbian love affairs, Yu Pui Tsuen had to rely on the nudity and sex from his cast of relative unknowns to save the day.  When a young man dreams that he drowns after a night of carnal passion, he asks a buddhist monk to translate the experience for him. The monk replies that the dream is a warning not to indulge the pleasures of the flesh to excess, but the man ignores his advice, marrying a virgin and making love to her constantly. However, after several torrid affairs, the man begins to realise the sagacity of the monk's warning.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cjVqMsLaEETzPiD9VrYNFpGWMyE.jpg", "actors": ["Cheng Yuen-Man ()", "Chung-Sing Choh ()", "Choh Chung-Sing ()", "Ying Kiu Chow ()", "Chin Fei Lam ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
