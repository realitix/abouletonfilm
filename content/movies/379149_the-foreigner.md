I understand that the movie is in actual fact based on a novel called _The Chinaman_, which I assume unfolds more or less as the film does. But the Troubles-themed Political Drama makes up most of the runtime in _The Foreigner_, and the Action/Revenge Thriller element seems almost like at some point in pre-production the crew went \"Holy shit, did you know we can put Jackie Chan in this? Quickly! Write him a role!\". Although I'm sure that it's not the case, that is how it feels, and while the Action/Revenge Thriller element is the best part of the movie, its failure to mesh with the piece at large does bring it all down a bit.\r\n\r\nStill a worthwhile watch if you're a fan of the Chan.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"}], "recommandations_id": [390043, 337170, 449443, 395990]}
