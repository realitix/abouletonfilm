I most expected Hollis Frampton (because of ZORN\u2019S LEMMA) to pick up the challenge; but he never did. In some sense I think composer Corner has \u2013 and now we have this dance of riddles as music and film combine to make \u2018passage,\u2019 in every sense of the word, further possible.\u201d \u2013S.B.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
