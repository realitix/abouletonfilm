But as the perspective out her window permanently shifts, so does the artist's point of view.  The Monolith is directed by Angelo J. Guglielmo, Jr. (The Woman Who Wasn't There), produced and shot by Andy Bowley, EP'd by Andrea L. Smith. Rosie Walunas adeptly employed the Adobe Creative Suite to bring over 200 pieces of Leech\u2019s beautiful artwork to life using Animation, Motion Graphics and Compositing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1wIE3fVomfU2DMIV4fqw2er9bc6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
