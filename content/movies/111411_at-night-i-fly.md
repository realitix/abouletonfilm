This world is less about dangerous drama and more, as one of them describes, \"about isolation. About closure of both the mind and the heart. And the spirit.\" The documentary shows prisoners, most serving a life sentence, who refuse such closure and instead work to uncover and express themselves. Their primary tool is making art and the film takes us to New Folsom's Arts in Corrections' room, to prison poetry readings, gospel choirs, blues guitar on the yard, and to many more scenes of creation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pPazV83x4ATiPDQ8p05m5N3xrYq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [83678, 56500, 268265, 21842], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
