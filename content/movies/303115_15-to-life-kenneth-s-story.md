The United States is the only country in the world that routinely condemns children to die in prison. This is the story of one of those children, now a young man, seeking a second chance in Florida. At age 15, Kenneth Young received four consecutive life sentences for a series of armed robberies. Imprisoned for more than a decade, he believed he would die behind bars. Now a U.S. Supreme Court decision could set him free. 15 to Life: Kenneth's Story follows Young's struggle for redemption, revealing a justice system with thousands of young people serving sentences intended for society's most dangerous criminals.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yovjztiuvfDJ22xxVHcvZdQ0bF9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
