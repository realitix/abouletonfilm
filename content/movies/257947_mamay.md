Hundreds of years ago, in the wild steppes of Crimea that form an uneasy border between East and West, Europe and Asia, nomad and farmer, the proud Cossack Mamay falls in love with the Tatar beauty Omai. The title, like the storyline, holds a variety of different meanings taken from different cultures. In Turkic languages, it means \"no one,\" but it was also the name of a famous Mongol conqueror, the great grandson of Ghengis-Khan. In Persian legends, mamay literally means \"the spirit of the steppes. \"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b7nWXSCFgYk9ie5ZQZKKR1YY153.jpg", "actors": ["Andrij Bilous (Mamay)", "Viktoria Spesivtseva (Tatar woman)", "Nazl Sejtablaeva (Little Tatar girl)", "Sergey Romanyuk (Eldest brotther)", "Oles Sanin (Middle brother)", "Akhtem Seitablaiev (Tatar warrior)", "Eldar Akimov (Tatar warrior)", "Emil Rasilov (Tatar warrior)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Fp4yMiTqvnM"}
