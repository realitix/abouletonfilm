Although Butoh is often viewed as Japan's equivalent of modern dance, in actuality it has little to do with the rational principles of modernism. Butoh is a theater of improvisation which places the personal experiences of the dancer on center-stage. By reestablishing the ancient Japanese connection of dance, music, and masks, and by recalling the Buddhist death dances of rural Japan, Butoh incorporates much traditional theater. At the same time, it is a movement of resistance against the abandonment of traditional culture to a highly organized consumer-oriented society.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d0oL3ZhqBXIiUTxErdu3dBj3HHu.jpg", "actors": ["Yoko Ashikawa (Herself - Interviewee)", "Akiko Motofuji (Herself - Interviewee)", "Nario Goda (Himself)", "Tatsumi Hijikata (Himself)", "Yukio Waguri (Himself)", "Akaji Maro (Himself)", "Min Tanaka (Himself)", "Kazuo \u00d4no (Himself)", "Natsu Nakajima (Herself)", "Sanae Hiruta (Herself)", "Sankai Juku (Themselves)", "Dai Rakuda Kan (Themselves)", "Byakko-Sha (Themselves)", "Muteki-Sha (Themselves)", "Maijuku (Themselves)", "Hakutobo (Themselves)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
