A seven year-old boy, grumpy and unwilling to do his homework, is scolded by his mother. In an outburst of anger, the young boy takes it out on every object around: a tea pot, a kettle, a book, a clock... until he slumps on an old armchair, worn-out. Suddenly, fantastic events happen. Objects come to life, animals start to chat, and they all plot revenge. Terrified, the young boy calls his mum, but gets no response. The creatures rush at the young boy. However a squirrel, hurt in the battle, is rescued by the child. Full of regrets, the creatures cease to torment the young boy, and forgive him for his past wrongdoings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dwVw05dXuGEuiqNwUNxNZWU2p0m.jpg", "actors": ["Marly Knoben ()", "Roslyn Anderson ()", "Stephen Sheriff ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
