I want to awaken the fearless self. A Skinny Man Attacked Daddy takes a look at the family and the place where I grew up. So much of what is 'me' comes from attitudes, expectations, fears, habits, beliefs that I inherited from my parents (and they in turn from theirs). The video is about separation form the family. My work is to try to know myself - the only way to change inherited patterns.' - Vivienne Dick", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4tdBMJPKELIC2cSDrwkFit0orFs.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
