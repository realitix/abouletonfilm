Once prominent, it is now low in attendance, low in enrollment and low on money; and at a meeting with instructors Drury and Annabelle Brown, Dean Hargreaves reveals that CEO Benjamin Ware III, grandson of the college's founder, claims the estate of his late grandfather is now also destitute, which they believe is untrue and a result of Annabelle's having spurned his affections. They decide to appeal to their famous alumni for financial help thru a reunion, and invitations are sent. Many could help; but surely not Lucius Jordan, a timid lad who loved Annabelle too but dropped out under pressure from Ware. What they don't know is, he's now Louis Jordan, king of swing and leader of the Tympani Band.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n5v8AgAWA9FZZotNWcFkP5xG8IM.jpg", "actors": ["Louis Jordan (Lucius Brokenshire 'Louis' Jordan)", "Frank L.
