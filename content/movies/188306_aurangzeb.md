This city rose from a small town to a boom town satellite city in just fifteen years. However, the law and order are yet to catch up. A family of Policemen - A family of Gangsters - Under the guise of a respected citizen, Yashwardhan (Jackie Shroff) runs a parallel world - a world, where he is the Emperor. To bring down a criminal - the law will have to now think like a criminal. When Vishal (Arjun Kapoor) is planted in Yashwardhan's world in place of Ajay (Arjun Kapoor), the lawmakers (Rishi Kapoor and Prithviraj) roll the dice and a sequence of events unravel - something much more than what Vishal bargained for, as he finds himself in a predicament that puts him to the test.
