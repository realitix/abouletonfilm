Return to Hogmany 1957 when a fiesty group of Glasgow women; Mrs Culfeathers, Dolly, Doreen and the irrepressible Magrit, all meet at The Steamie to do the traditional family wash before the New Year.  The Steamie is a hilarious cameo of Glasgow's social history where the washing was always easier to do when the Women shared their laugher and sorrow and a scandalous supply of gossip.  This is the definitive version of the most popular play of the last 20 years with the all star cast of Dorothy Paul as Magrit, Eileen McCallum as Dolly, Kate Murphy as Doreen, Sheila McDonald as Mrs Culfeathers and a very young Peter Mullan as Andy, the whisky loving handy man.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sII8V8Qx9kplFUGIUrS5lzVupGI.jpg", "actors": ["Eileen McCallum (Dolly)", "Dorothy Paul (Magrit)", "Katy Murphy (Doreen)", "Sheila Donald (Mrs Culfeathers)", "Peter Mullan (Andy)", "Irene Sunters (Grumpy Woman)", "Caroline Paterson (Doreen's Pal)", "Myra McFadyen (Helen Mahuire's Auntie)", "Lillian Welsh (Dr Bell's Patient)", "Faye Milligan (Wee Dumpy Doll)", "Catherine-Ann Jack (Big Dumpy Doll)", "James Langton (Gordon MacRae)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "T8Kgul8DOTU"}
