The performances followed the release of 1980's Trilogy, Sinatra's ambitious triple-album comeback that featured \"The Theme from New York, New York.\" Sinatra mixes \"Summer Me, Winter Me\" from that album with his hits \"I've Got the World on a String\" and \"I've Got You Under My Skin.\" Foreshadowing the follow-up to Trilogy is \"The Gal That Got Away\"/\"It Never Entered My Mind,\" a medley that would appear on She Shot Me Down in 1981.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ozZ1HC2aFYDSFTCZk7JBVp3CEXy.jpg", "actors": ["Frank Sinatra (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "FaqDV1W7fhM"}
