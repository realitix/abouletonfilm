Based on the famous Ginga Tetsudou no Yoru story written by Kenji Miyazawa in the early 20th century, Kagaya, a digital fine artist, has breathed new life into the unique imaginary world using creativity and precise astronomical knowledge.  The starry sky is depicted as the Celestial Field made up of a river, a field of silver grasses, flowers, birds, survey towers, railway signals and more. Across this amazing beautiful scenery, the Celestial Railroad runs along the Milky Way.  It is a fantasy world in full colour, but designed with scientific accuracy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7QdO3Sbu7D4hB7iZfPXZx98uICN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
