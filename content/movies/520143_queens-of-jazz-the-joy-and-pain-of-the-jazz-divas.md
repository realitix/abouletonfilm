Looking at the lives and careers of six individual singers (Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, Sarah Vaughan, Nina Simone and Annie Ross), the film not only talks to those who knew and worked with these queens of jazz, but also to contemporary singers who sit on the shoulders of these trailblazing talents without having to endure the pain and hardship it took for them to make their highly individual voices heard above the prejudice of mid-century America.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/atBrG7Q9zuosIGNUgSIL7gzOlVb.jpg", "actors": ["Billie Holliday (Self/Archive Footage)", "Peggy Lee (Self/Archive Footage)", "Sarah Vaughan (Self/Archive Footage)", "Nina Simone (Self/Archive Footage)", "Ella Fitzgerald (Self/Archive Footage)", "Annie Ross (Self/Archive Footage)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
