In a similar vein to the National Theatre\u2019s smash-hit classic comedies, She Stoops to Conquer and London Assurance, The Magistrate is sure to have audiences doubled up with laughter. When amiable magistrate Posket (John Lithgow) marries Agatha (Olivier Award-winner Nancy Carroll, After the Dance), little does he realise she\u2019s dropped five years from her age \u2013 and her son\u2019s. When her deception looks set to be revealed, it sparks a series of hilarious indignities and outrageous mishaps.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6XtyZ4brt6b4JtWRZlCZYdtPivA.jpg", "actors": ["John Lithgow (Posket)", "Nancy Carroll (Agatha)", "Christina Cole (Charlotte)", "Nicholas Burns (Captain Horace Vale)", "Nicholas Blane (Mr. Bullamy)", "Jonathan Coy (Colonel Lukyn)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "AAO6M7MtHdk"}
