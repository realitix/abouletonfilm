A carnival barker foolishly releases his 400 pound gorilla, who then literally goes bananas on a rampage of raw rape and boffo butchery - leaving the low rent population of Long Island either sexually violated, slaughtered - or both! From maverick indy filmmaker Keith J. Crocker (Blitzkrieg: Escape from Stalag 69), THE BLOODY APE is a gore-soaked love letter to the sex and violence of the grind house movie era that pulls no punches and offers no apologies for wallowing in a skin-drenched stew of crudeness and camp! Banned from numerous festivals around the world, ignored by critics and loathed by the politically correct....but now there just is no stopping THE BLOODY APE!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pPJNaLiqIItBBmFa2zcHNySacC9.jpg", "actors": ["Bob Ceislick (Hippie)", "Christina Zuber Crocker (Lady)", "Kevin Crocker (Officer O'Flannery)", "Yalcin Cucyuksel (Kapinsky)", "Domenique (Rabbis Wife)", "Salvatore Finkel (Rabbi Rabinowitz)", "Michelle Furnaux (Ginger's Roomate #1)", "Arlene Hansen (Ginger)", "Paul Hittner (Video Store Customer)", "Christopher Hoskins (Duane)", "Joe Hutchinson (Israel)", "Larry Koster (Vic White)", "Lynn Metefaice (Ginger's Roomate #2)", "Kevin Ratigan (Video Store Owner)", "George Reis (LoBianco / Ape)", "Paul Richichi (Lampini)", "Ray Schwetz (Cop)", "Gus Torres (Gas Station Attendant)", "Joe Zaso (LoBianco's Partner)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
