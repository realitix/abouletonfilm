It was a perfect combination of reporting, analysis, predictions, humor and talent. But there was no personality on the show more popular than Jimmy \u201cThe Greek\u201d Snyder. Born in Steubenville, Ohio, to Greek immigrants, Jimmy overcame childhood tragedy, moved to Las Vegas, and eventually became the biggest name in the world of sports handicapping. When CBS added him as an \u201canalyst\u201d on \u201cThe NFL Today,\u201d \u201cThe Greek\u201d not only further increased his stature as a sort of national folk hero, but he also gained an air of respectability never before associated with gamblers. Peabody Award-winning filmmaker Fritz Mitchell, who broke in as an intern on \u201cThe NFL Today,\u201d will examine Snyder\u2019s impact on the growth of sports gambling, while also taking a fresh look at The Greek\u2019s tragic downfall.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eVKOpyDaYu8l6UODtTTjokZE0JT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [54734, 54742, 54672, 54685], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
