Many of them are \"in\" for minor drug and prostitution-related offenses, and at least half of them are HIV positive. One woman promises she will kill herself before her beauty fades from the AIDS syndrome: two years later the filmmaker captures her, wan and wasted, but out of prison. Most of these women have grave difficulties finding work or housing when they are released, and are forced to resort to the same desperate measures that got them incarcerated in the first place.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wF1pVoInjMmfeU7jFPv9pn3J0SG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
