Far ahead of her time and in a male-dominated world, Hildegard challenged the established authority of the Church, both philosophically and musically. Accompanying herself on authentic medieval instruments, Linn performs six of Hildegard's original songs and through the mystic's actual letters and writings transports us to the turbulent times of the Crusades of Western Europe. Hildegard's timeless message of spiritual truth, holistic healing and caring for the earth is more urgent today than ever.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
