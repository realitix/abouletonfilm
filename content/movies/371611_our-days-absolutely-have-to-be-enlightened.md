We witness a concert given by the inmates of a prison in Orl\u00e9ans. Yet, they remain unseen, beyond the prison walls, all along the film, while the camera looks at those who listen to the music outside, in front of the prison. Silent emotions, the rapt faces of the listeners, humming along the prisoners, and their unrevealed personal histories, form a human gallery of potential stories, born out of the viewer's imagination.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gALDgmjPUeZPlkyInPrwFleYu13.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
