Her nickname Bloody Luna was a reference  to her incredibly brutal methods of interrogation. In the early 1960s, she appears in a centre for the blind on the outskirts of  Warsaw, a place often visited by Cardinal Wyszy\u0144ski, whose imprisonment in 1953-1956 Brystiger supervised personally. During a difficult and heated discussion with the cardinal, Brystiger denounces the communist ideology and begs for forgiveness for her crimes and for guidance in her search for God.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/upISfxpsScJh3spfeyxnPRI2bor.jpg", "actors": ["Maria Mamona (Julia Brystygier)", "Malgorzata Zajaczkowska (Sister Benedicta)", "Janusz Gajos (Father Cieciorka)", "Marek Kalita (The Primate, Cardinal Wyszynski)", "Bartosz Porczyk (Prisoner)", "Kazimierz Kaczor (Mourner)", "S\u0142awomir Orzechowski (Caretaker)", "Marcin Tro\u0144ski (Bartender)", "Barbara Bursztynowicz (Woman in the canteen)", "Jacek Bursztynowicz (Head of the Ward)", "Zbigniew Konopka (Prosecutor)", "Andrzej Szenajch (Gate Keeper)", "Piotr Toloczko (Aide-de-camp)", "Mariusz Wojciechowski (Antoni Marylski)", "Olga Bo\u0142\u0105d\u017a (Young Brystygierowa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "1JEry9QPXbE"}
