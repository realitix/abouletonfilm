The camera is fixed as the 'space' inside the frame itself transforms, destructs and evolves over the years: historical eras are evoked through references to 17th, 18th and 19th century painting and early 20th century cinema and the human presence in the house is signalled through scenes of everyday labor and domestic duty.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vGiKGkCh7PMnDndq5qBA1DpIBBu.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Hirst (Ghost)", "Tim Goldie (Ghost)", "Mark Harwood (Ghost)", "Paul Sykes (Ghost)", "Emily May (Ghost)", "Julie Hermann (Ghost)", "Danielle Trigg (Ghost)", "Kelly Russell (Ghost)", "Christina Rex (Ghost)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
