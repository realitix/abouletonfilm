Given its geographical situation, it is a place that opens wide the doors of imagination. A Girl from Ouessant is an invented and, at the same time very documented, cartography of the island. This methodical statement starts as the diary of \u00c9l\u00e9onore Saintagnan, the resident artist-filmmaker at the Cr\u00e9ac\u2019h semaphore station, an ideal site for observing the surrounding area. Then, the account shifts towards a playful mise en sc\u00e8ne, peopled with sailors\u2019 wives, kelp burners, stories of little black sheep or countless shipwrecks\u2026 Drawing on the regional archives filmed in black and white dating from a time when the island lived mainly from fishing, the game begins.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v7OSZNYjmYMDnJ5tui47EEXQeKn.jpg", "actors": ["\u00c9l\u00e9onore Saintagnan (Barba)", "Ann Stouvenel (Anne)", "Gr\u00e9goire Motte (Saint-Roch)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
