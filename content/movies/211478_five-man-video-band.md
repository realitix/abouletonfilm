The biggest hit from the album was the song \"Signs\", a cover version originally from the band Five Man Electrical Band, who also had a hit with the song (Tesla's version included a few uses of \"fuck\" not in the original version). Other songs included \"Love Song\" and \"The Way It Is\" (hits from their previous album The Great Radio Controversy) and covers of The Rolling Stones' \"Mother's Little Helper\", Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Lodi\", and The Beatles' \"We Can Work It Out\". It was recorded live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the Trocadero Theatre. It's considered the first unplugged show ever recorded, before MTV did it."}], "recommandations_id": []}
