But that epic event in world history has never been told before through the perspective of the strange handful of spies who made it possible. D-Day was a great victory of arms, a tactical coup, and a moral crusade. But it was also a triumph for espionage, deceit, and thinking of the most twisted sort.  Following on from his hugely successful BBC Two documentaries, Operation Mincemeat and Double Agent: The Eddie Chapman Story (Agent Zigzag), writer and presenter Ben Macintyre returns to the small screen to bring to life his third best-selling book - Double Cross The True Story of the D-Day Spies. Macintyre reveals the gripping true story of five of the double agents who helped to make D-day such a success.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zVAjvovTtyblZ1LlVQKiZyGrWrK.jpg", "actors": ["Ben Macintyre (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
