Ronson finds that most contain materials reflecting work Kubrick did after the release of \"Barry Lindon \" in 1975, when Kubrick's film output slowed down. Ronson finds audition tapes for \"Full Metal Jacket,\" photographs to find the right hat for \"Clockwork Orange\" or the right doorway for \"Eyes Wide Shut\" -- thousands of details that went into Kubrick's meticulous approach. Ronson believes that the boxes show \"the rhythm of genius.\" Interviews with family, staff, and friends are included.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/92vA4lHOWye6aYQsVLqTfYUVKYq.jpg", "actors": ["Jon Ronson (Himself)", "Anthony Frewin (Himself)", "Jan Harlan (Himself)", "Christiane Kubrick (Herself)", "Manuel Harlan (Himself)", "Anya Kubrick (Herself)", "Leon Vitali (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [81976, 61312, 56224, 118769], "youtube_key": "htQq3oYO5sI"}
