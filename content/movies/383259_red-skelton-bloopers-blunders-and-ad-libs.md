But as long as I make 'em laugh, they ain't going to put me away.\" You'll see how nuts he can be-and how much he can make you laugh-in this hilarious collection of sketches, clips, monologues, and routines featuring goofs, flubs, missed cues, blown lines, and zany antics. Whether he's wincing over a joke that died, cracking up his co-stars, or muttering about what he did during rehearsal, these moments that weren't in the script showcase Skelton at his wild and unpredictable best. You'll see him clowning with guest stars Harpo Marx, Vincent Price, and Audrey Meadows, and as Deadeye, Clem Kadiddlehopper, San Fernando Red, Freddy the Freeloader, George Appleby, and other classic roles.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
