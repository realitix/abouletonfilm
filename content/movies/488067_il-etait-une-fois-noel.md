There was one exception to the success of the movie.  When you see a woman in a movie that you know is likely to become a queen when all is said and done, you expect someone who appears capable of being and sounding regal.  Tara, who is very attractive, appeared and sounded more like a hooker and a queen in this movie."}], "recommandations_id": [488063, 480626, 479606, 150670]}
