Notable for the screen debut of Jack Lemmon, Holliday had great screen chemistry with both suitors of her love triangle, Lemmon and Peter Lawford. In today's media-obsessive and Facebook-oriented culture, where selfies and 'food porn' are splashed online whenever people leave their homes, I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if this got remade with contemporary twists (here, Holliday pays part of her life savings, simply because she wants her name, 'Gladys Glover', on the largest billboard of New York City, after she loses a modeling job for being too fat--and chaos ensues when Lawford's company, who's father has always utilized that billboard for their ad campaign every summer, wants to know why it's reserved, and with simply the huge words, 'Gladys Glover' on it.\r\n\r\nLemmon's doings, both in being so intrigued by her that he moves into her apartment building, right across the hall from her, and in making a documentary film about their meeting, when he incorrectly thinks he's licked and that she's chosen Lawford as her partner, were very nice touches, from the Garson Kanin script. If you come across a film that comes from one of his screenplays, don't hesitate for a moment. Chances are very good that you're in for a real treat.\r\n\r\nA documentary DVD extra on Lemmon's life and career (which I believe was on my copy of 'Glengarry Glen Ross', but I may be wrong) is called 'Magic Time: A Tribute to Jack Lemmon'. It's great, and well-worth checking out. He sometimes gets short shrift amongst cinephiles because he mostly does comic roles, but he didn't get two Oscars and eight nominations overall for nothing. Though he's more well-known both for his films with Walter Matthau, and as the alter ego of Billy Wilder in seven of his films, check this out if you've ever been a fan. You'll be very pleasantly surprised by this little gem."}], "recommandations_id": [34662, 43486, 52841, 78331]}
