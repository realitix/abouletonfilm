The Others", "slug_title": "china-87-the-others", "date": "", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "We follow the film journey of director Viollaine de Villers and traveller Jean-Pierre Outers around the Chinese interior during the late 1980s. In a fragmented sequence of archival shots, vignettes of local culture gradually emerge, including everyday work, leisure time moments, and reflections of ancient myths. But it\u2019s not just another of the countless travel documentaries or urban symphonies, but rather a suggestive video essay. The VHS camera becomes a fully-fledged historiographical medium through which foreign culture is revealed in all its myriad facets without crystallizing it into a comfortably consumable image", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bIGWkvgNfSofbkGjuBkBeswgo8N.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
