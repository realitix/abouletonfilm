They both owe gambling debts to the nasty mobster Rabid Hsiung, so they're in desperate need of money, leading them to take on a request from the elderly Taoist master Tang to help him capture the Banana Spirit. On a late-night search, the trio is frightened by a demon as well as awakening the Banana Spirit, Muyung Yu-Yu, who takes the earthly form of a beautiful model and seduces Chic. Chic and the ghost become lovers, and she saves his life when he is shot at by mobsters as well as helping him win a great deal of money at one of Rabid Hsiung's casinos. Hsiung figures out that Yu-Yu has special powers, which he attempts to use for his own benefit, but Chic kills him before he can realize his plans. Unfortunately, Hsiung rises from the grave as a clownish evil spirit looking for revenge, and Yu-Yu's allotted time on Earth is quickly running out.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8soVSBcujA0KW24k1hpPfSlhUDX.jpg", "actors": ["Francis Ng (Chic)", "Richard Ng (Uncle Tang)", "Tommy Wong (Rabid Hsiung)", "Lam Ching-Ying (Master Chen Sheng)", "Collin Chou (Che)", "Amy Wu Mei-Yee (Mei Yi)", "Teddy Yip Wing-Cho (Mr. Yeh)", "Josephine Foo Lai-Yan (Iris / Chang)", "Jackson Ng (Hsiung's Thug)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
