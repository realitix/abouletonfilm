Both women are expecting babies, both couples tell offbeat stories, both couples get by with what little they have. Yet Mike Leigh allows his actors to show not how much but how little these two couple have in common. \"Four Days in July\" is wonderful yet scathing look at the turmoil that has engulfed Northern Ireland for generations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oTwIHU82ckQXwVYPkzhFB30wDVz.jpg", "actors": ["Br\u00edd Brennan (Colette)", "Des McAleer (Eugene)", "Charles Lawson (Billy)", "Paula Hamilton (Lorraine)", "Stephen Rea (Dixie McConville)", "Shane Connaughton (Brendan)", "Eileen Pollock (Carmel)", "David Coyle (Mickey)", "John Hewitt (Mr Roper)", "Ann Hasson (Sister Midwife)", "B.J.
