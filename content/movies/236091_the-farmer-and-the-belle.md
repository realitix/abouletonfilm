Fortunately, or unfortunately, the boys are driving by. They compete for the job. Chores: Getting water from a well, picking apples, shoeing a horse, gathering eggs. Popeye feeds a hen a little spinach, and she produces a mountain of eggs, which eventually end up all over Bluto. Bluto drops an anvil on Popeye, then goes after Olive against her wishes, chasing her into a succession of haystacks (where he finds a needle!). The chicken feeds Popeye his spinach, and he triumphs, sending Bluto into the pigpen (where the pigs won't have anything to do with him).", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
