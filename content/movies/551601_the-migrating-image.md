What if we look for images we have never seen \u2013 or revisit those we have seen but never noticed \u2013 and start wondering how they came about and who they are intended for? The Migrating Image follows the pictorial flow of refugees on their journey to and up through Europe. The film is based on photos of refugees and turns the camera back on us \u2013 as we created them and ultimately consume them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vONJ8rP5Xmn9YKg3gvNX4dVxy4B.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
