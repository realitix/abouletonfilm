Following the advice of his friend Quincampoix, Cambo decides to trade places with Bardac, a painter, who happens to be his lookalike. Bardac slips into Cambo's shoes with delight although he does not really live up to his task. But Cambo, who manages to ruin Parizot, makes a 100% profit on the situation. There are of course some misunderstandings when one man is mistaken for the other, notably as concerns Lulu and Genevi\u00e8ve, respectively Bardac's and Cambo's sweethearts, but things finally return to their initial state.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o2KtLVOOUbirYm5IjGRBkBoIYA0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
