Du Bois. This film is an experimental essay in three movements that explores the importance of being more than an \"ally\" in struggle, by sharing histories of committed accomplices John Brown, Marilyn Buck, and others. The film also delves into the history of the landscape and former prairie that was the earth on which Brown's militants trained. In the face of exploitation of people and destruction of land, radical struggle cultivates new life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mtZE0kKd02za1dpavnDqtglHDcz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
