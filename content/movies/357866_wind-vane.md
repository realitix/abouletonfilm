Both cameras were free to pan through 360 degrees in the horizontal plane. There are three continuous 100 foot takes for each screen. The movements of the two cameras, which were filming simultaneously, were controlled by the wind strength and direction.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2QiKVckMccEOIVQYmkoBqVyd7ay.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
