Jaroslav Kvapil\u2019s libretto inspired Dvorak to compose a masterpiece, a compelling opera full of poignant lyricism and dramatic twists. \u00c1d\u00e1m Fisher and Stefan Herheim masterfully presented this \u2018lyrical fairytale\u2019 at La Monnaie in 2008. In this widely acclaimed interpretation, the fairytale elements sometimes assume frighteningly realistic dimensions so that one might see this enchanting production as a psychoanalytical study of male fantasies and female archetypes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/VtP26bthUPEVs85YPAexo7Loje.jpg", "actors": ["Myrt\u00f2 Papatanasiu (Rusalka)", "Willard White (Vodnik)", "Pavel Cernoch (The prince)", "Ren\u00e9e Morloc (Jezibaba)", "Annalena Persson (The foreign prince)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "S50vsBB-hEE"}
