Has something changed? Who are these beings, where do they come from, why do they work in the shadows and what is their agenda? Has the U.S. been sharing tech from these visitors since the 50s?  Well take actual samples from a sphere that crashed to earth in Mexico and analyze them under an Electron Microscope, (SEM). Well examine a piece of drywall from a home that was visited. Are the fingerprints human, or alien? WATCHERS 7 looks at the science behind UFOs and their origin in ancient Biblical texts. A UK poll indicates more people believe in ETs than God.
