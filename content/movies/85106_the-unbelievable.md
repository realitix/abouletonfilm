What they never expected is a horrifying journey with encounters of unexplained occurrences. Led by a notable parapsychologist, the encounters are so gruesome and hone chilling beyond what they can bear, ranging from paranormal phenomenon such as poltergeist, exorcism, haunted house to supernatural force like witchcraft, spells, voodoo, curse, tec.  Based on Hong Kong Cable TV\u2019s popular paranormal phenomena program of the same name, \u201cThe Unbelievable\u201d is a documentary-style movie that throws the audiences to the twilight zone\u2026and beyond! Rated Category III for its shocking scenes of horror, violence and nudity, the reality program-turned-movie features extreme content that makes the TV version look tame in comparison. I\u2019m a fan of the HK TV program.
