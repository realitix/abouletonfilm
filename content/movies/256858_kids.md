The children interned here include ten-year-olds Marvin and Tommy. Marvin, fiddling with a mini plastic Lego sword, explains matter-of-factly to the camera, \u201cThis is a knife. You use it to cut stomachs open.\u201d Dennis, who is even younger, is seen in a hysteric fit, mimicking some pornographic scene. Boys will be boys, but innocence is disproportionately spare here. Choosing not to dwell on the harsh specifics, B\u00fcttner reveals the disconcerting manner in which traumatic episodes can manifest themselves in the mundane \u2014 a game of Lego, Hide and Seek, or Truth or Dare. Filmed in lapidary black-and-white, B\u00fcttner\u2019s fascinating film sheds light on childhood from the boys\u2019 characteristically disadvantaged perspective \u2014 one not yet fully cognizant \u2014 leaving much ethically to ponder over.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j5wiywdZ6s8vqk5nKd3drrnxvB0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "4WHHpgudbcE"}
