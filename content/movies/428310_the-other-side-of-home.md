In 2015, a Turkish woman named Maya discovers that her great grandmother was survivor of the Armenian genocide. Maya embodies the conflict as she has two enemies living in her body: one side that suffers and the other side that denies. The documentary follows Maya as she decides to go to Armenia to take part in the 100th commemoration of the genocide and to explore her conflicted identity. This film is a universal story of identity, denial, and how the experience of genocide creates a ripple effect for future generations on both sides.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2IeJiJqIAIzmrIsTisjkaZhgMyD.jpg", "actors": ["Ali Cesur (Turkish Soldier)", "Michelle Yolyan (Nuriye)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "fYxu5Gn07rc"}
