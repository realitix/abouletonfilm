Bluto is a strongman, claiming to be King of the Mardi Gras, and drawing a large crowd. Popeye, nearby, claims only, \"I yam what I yam,\" and has no crowd, but still draws Bluto's wrath. He manages to spoil a balance trick, then tops it with Wimpy in a chair. Olive then volunteers to be levitated; Bluto pulls her over and saws her in half. Olive escapes to a roller coaster with the boys in pursuit.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qzuFo1JeE1cVOOemrtvRnhBpdag.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Mercer (Popeye)", "Gus Wickie (Bluto)", "Mae Questel (Olive Oyl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
