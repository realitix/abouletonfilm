This 19-track album contains all of their early-'80s hits, and while they aren't as energetic on-stage as they are in the studio, the band still perform with a great amount of flamboyance. The record is the Scorpions' only worthwhile live album and is a must for their fans.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nvEDQIypeGBmSTO36PJQuJa89aP.jpg", "actors": ["Klaus Meine (lead vocals)", "Matthias Jabs (lead guitar, backing vocals)", "Rudolf Schenker (rhythm guitar, backing vocals)", "Francis Buchholz (bass, backing vocals)", "Herman Rarebell (drums, percussion, backing vocals)", "Scorpions ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
