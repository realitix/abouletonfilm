Their only block was the 500 monk-soldiers protecting the Shaolin Temple. Under the pretense of an order from the Emperor, Prince Fu sent all 500 monk-soldiers away to fight bandits, leaving Shaolin Temple unprotected. Guang Ci had been training some of the young monks in martial arts. With the 500 monk-soldiers gone, Prince Fu planned his ambush and his army began surrounding the Shaolin Temple. Aware of Prince Fu's evil intentions, the young monks defend the temple with Tong Deng leading. Only his \"Tong Zi Gong\" can overwhelm Prince Fu's \"Light Kicking\" in this struggle for consummate power. Superb Wu Shu fights in the tradition of Jet Li's, Shaolin temple.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xXvWvCzgUdlS9jSSWa698BXA4mB.jpg", "actors": ["Jet Lee II ()", "Cheung Lung ()", "Wang Li-Sha ()", "Yuk-Hing Wong ()", "Siu Chiu-Ming ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
