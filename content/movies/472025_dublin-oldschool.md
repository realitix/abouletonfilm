Somewhere between the DJs, decks, drug busts and hilltop raves, he stumbles across a familiar face from the past, his brother Daniel. Daniel is an educated homeless heroin addict living on the streets of Dublin. The brothers haven\u2019t seen or spoken to each other in years but over a lost weekend they reconnect and reminisce over tunes, trips, their history and their city.
