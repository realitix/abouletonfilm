Framed more like the episode of anthology show I never want to watch than an actual movie, _Clown Kill_ is certainly one of the worst films I've seen this year, despite garnering an explicable re-release from when it was first made as _Lock In_ three years earlier.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605 - Of no value. Avoid at all costs._"}], "recommandations_id": []}
