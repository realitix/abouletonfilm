Dotson also \u201cblows the bottle\u201d using a Coca-Cola bottle partially filled with water. Both his bottle blowing and his one-strand-on-the-wall are important links between African musical roots and the blues. The one-strand marks the beginning of the \u201cslide guitar\u201d style which heavily influenced 20th-century blues, rock and roll, and rock music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pAeTlY6fFS41ynuPM7doUaSysI6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
