Katka, her girl friends Lenka and Martina, and her fellow-pupils Franta, Joska and freckled Vrabc\u00e1k, have spent five years going to the same little one-class school in their home mountain village of Pastvina. Their kind teacher Smet\u00e1cek was very understanding about their games and fantasies, but he didn't teach them much about arithmetic. They are now laughed at for their ignorance by the strict Bidlo, their new teacher at the near-by little town. As he does every year, Smet\u00e1cek is preparing a theatre performance with the local children. Katka suggests the fairytale about Snow White", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/13hp0I9jfp6eTrMrnwg4BWk3WRf.jpg", "actors": ["Marie Moravcov\u00e1 (Katka)", "Zdena Hadrbolcov\u00e1 (Kat\u00e8ina matka)", "Petr Skarke (Kat\u00e8in otec)", "Mark\u00e9ta Hermannov\u00e1 (Lenka)", "Franti\u0161ek Hus\u00e1k (Bidlo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
