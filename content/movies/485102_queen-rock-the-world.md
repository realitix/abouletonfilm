Conducting insightful interviews with all four band members as well as filming them at work in the studio as they were planning and rehearsing their forthcoming North American Tour, and then following them as they performed across the US, Bob captured a band attempting to replicate their huge domestic success on the global stage. To mark the 40th anniversary of the release of the News of the World album, the footage has now been carefully restored and revisited to compile this hour-long portrait of a group setting out to take the next step on their remarkable journey to becoming one of the biggest bands on the planet.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pvPCMkLu7GYvNZEYEkNNAXPrFbp.jpg", "actors": ["Freddie Mercury (Himself / Member Queen (archive footage))", "Brian May (Himself / Member Queen)", "Roger Taylor (Himself / Member Queen)", "John Deacon (Himself / Member Queen)", "Bob Harris (Himself - Narrator / Interviewer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "nUsQtgqIYQk"}
