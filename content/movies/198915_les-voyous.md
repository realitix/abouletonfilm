The delinquents of the title are three restless slum kids, given to petty thievery. When one of the boys expresses a desire to become a bullfighter, the others pool their energies to pull one big heist in order to finance their pal's dream. The would-be bullfighter makes a disastrously dismal debut in the ring, and the gang is rounded up by the cops. Delinquents was originally released in Spain as Los Golfos, but might have been more appropriately titled Los Goofos.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c67zGceKEbwb4g3nmxkw78RDihA.jpg", "actors": ["Manuel Zarzo (Juli\u00e1n)", "Luis Mar\u00edn (Ram\u00f3n)", "\u00d3scar Cruz (Juan)", "Juanjo Losada (El Chato)", "Rafael Vargas (Manolo)", "Ram\u00f3n Rubio (Paco)", "Mar\u00eda Mayer (Visi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [114116], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
