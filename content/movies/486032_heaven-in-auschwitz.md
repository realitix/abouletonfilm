These men and women, that back then were children, found a legendary Jewish-German character named Fredy Hirsch, who changed their lives forever. The work describes the terrible living conditions in Terezin Ghetto and; on the other hand, the approach to culture and art behind the walls of the concentration camp. Up to this moment, everything develops as a known story, but by the end of 1943 there is an unexpected turn when these children are deported together with their families to the extermination camp in Auschwitz-Birkenau. And there, in the middle of hell, they lived in.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qQLLIUZCc2fLQ4rW2ueFtDcsmO1.jpg", "actors": ["Dinah Gottliebova ()", "Eva Gross ()", "Dita Krause ()", "Zuzana Ruzickov\u00e1 ()", "Bedrich Steiner ()", "Fredy Hirsch (archive)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
