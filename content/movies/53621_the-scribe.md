The film is the last professionally filmed footage of film legend Buster Keaton, shot months before his death from lung cancer on February 1, 1966. He recreates several routines from his youth, as well as some new material for the film. Most notable was his recreation of a gag from his 1918 film The Bell Boy in which he mops the floor using only the tip of the mop, little by little while sitting on the floor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tQxkR9thjoKGQca32RclM9aIPl4.jpg", "actors": ["Buster Keaton (Journalist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [50271], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
