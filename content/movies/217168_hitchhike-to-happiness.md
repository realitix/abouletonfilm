Unfortunately, most of them believe that the waiter lacks the talent to make it big. Only an aspiring songwriter, and a former waitress who has become a famous Hollywood radio star, really believe in him. When the ex-waitress drops by the restaurant to say hello, she and the others decide to play a trick on an arrogant producer by making him believe the waiter has written a sure-fire hit. They succeed and the producer puts on the show. The singer gets to be the star. When the show becomes a smash, everyone is surprised. Songs include: \"Hitchhike To Happiness,\" \"For You And Me,\" \"Sentimental,\" and \"My Pushover Heart.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qjc57GdB9pAZNC52RSC11MxuEnN.jpg", "actors": ["Stanley Brown ()", "Dale Evans ()", "William Frawley ()", "Jerome Cowan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
