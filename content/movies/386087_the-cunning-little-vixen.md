Through myriad shifts of scene, the episodic story is presented in brightly-colored sets and costumes of blissful innocence and simplicity, designed by Bob Crowley. Jean-Claude Gallotta's choreography for the insects and animals, and Jean Kalman's lighting add to the nostalgically poetic effect of the whole. With Thomas Allen as the Forester, the cast includes Eva Jenis, Hanna Minutillo, Richard Novak and Ivan Kusnjer. This live recording comes from the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sk1Nr0QFfYGj9VHALNuw7rn2K0p.jpg", "actors": ["Thomas Allen (The Forester)", "Sarah Connolly ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
