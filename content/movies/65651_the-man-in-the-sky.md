At the Conway Aero-Manufacturing Company of Wolverhampton, Mitchell is to take the company's new rocket-propulsion transport plane up for tests, fully loaded and carrying two important passengers - Ministry official Crabtree and buyer's representative Ashmore. Mitchell learns from his boss, Reg Conway, that if Ashmore does not recommend the plane, the company will be out of business and Mitchell out of a job, since the plane is not even insured as the firm's entire capital is tied up in the plane. Aloft, an engine catches fire and the passengers and other crew bail out, but Mitchell refuses to obey orders to jettison the plane in the Irish Sea.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mmKwtcZUlLGn38v69YWuvN8FWj2.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Hawkins (John Mitchell)", "Elizabeth Sellars (Mary Mitchell)", "Megs Jenkins (Mrs. Snowden)", "Donald Pleasence (Crabtree)", "Catherine Lacey (Mary's mother)", "Lionel Jeffries (Keith)", "Walter Fitzgerald (Reginald Conway)", "Eddie Byrne (Ashmore)", "Victor Maddern (Joe Biggs)", "Jeremy Bodkin (Nicholas Mitchell)", "Gerard Lohan (Philip Mitchell)", "John Stratton (Peter Hook)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [86790, 80031, 112143, 81679], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
