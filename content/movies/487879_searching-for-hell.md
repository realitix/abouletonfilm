To hell. Five film-making teams embarked on a journey around the world, to tell creative and personal stories of people inhabiting contemporary hells; from the alleged entrance to the abyss of the damned in a distant Russia, American theme-park-like town called Hell, a house converted to a morbid vision of Buddhist underworld in Japan and deadly sulfur lake in Indonesia, to a dark - present day Congo. Visually stunning and provoking documentary \"Searching For Hell\" leads you through devil's territory and enables you to see what it can be in the modern world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6E9D3DfeqAqwKwHkfSVOFb69SKI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
