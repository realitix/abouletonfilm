Belson notes the influence of his study and practice of Yoga and Tibetan Buddhism on the creation of Samadhi.  The film is inspired by the principles of yogic meditation: the movement of consciousness towards samadhi (union of subject and object), the fusion of atma (breath and mind), a state which reveals the divine force of kundalini, a bright white light we discover at the end of Samadhi. The Tibetan Book of The Dead is the inspiration behind Belson\u2019s use of colour in Samadhi, corresponding to descriptions of the elements of Earth, Fire, Air and Water in the book. \u2014Sophie Pinchetti, The Third Eye", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2b5LyNdW6UYDji0R2u9BGTF1WW2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [163102, 154818, 209708, 146769], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
