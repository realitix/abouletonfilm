He survives the attack and winds up at a Shaolin temple where he insists he wants to stay and become a monk. His beautiful fianc\u00e9e (Lu Shu Chin) pleads with him to come back with her, but he refuses. The head monk, Brother Fa (Chan Wai Man), an orphan who's been at the monastery all his life and is expecting to succeed the current Shaolin Abbot, is jealous of the privileges Yao Hao has had in life and asks him questions about the outside world, including what it's like to touch a woman. Brother Fa's weakening resolve soon finds him leaving the monastery and falling into the clutches of Lord Eagle (Kam Kong), the Manchu ruler in the area who's trying to wipe out all resistance to Manchu/Ching rule.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nuJbN5vDbbxBgh1hCh2KFYbpNqJ.jpg", "actors": ["Sing Chen (Yao Hao)", "Lu Shu Chin (Yao's Fiancee)", "Kam Kong (Lord Eagle)", "Michael Chan (Brother Fa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
