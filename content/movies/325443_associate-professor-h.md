His supremely creepy assistant Traumer, strikingly played by Majewski regular Andrzej Rausz, is one such creation. Professor H. intends to transpose Traumer\u2019s brain with that of a renowned scientist, but is in for a surprise.  A dark film in every sense, DOCENT H. is particularly noteworthy for its soundtrack, consisting of eerie whirs and beeps interspaced with snatches of Bach\u2019s immortal \u201cToccata and Fugue in D Minor.\u201d (from: http://www.fright.com/edge/JanuszMajewski.htm)", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jan Machulski ()", "Andrzej Rausz (Docent hammler)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
