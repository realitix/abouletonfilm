For such an anthology the bonus features are especially poor, with a limited picture gallery and a DVD discography. The accompanying eight-page booklet does at least provide a useful insight into the making of the videos. It's also pleasing to hear the early and graceful instrumental track \"Erin Shore\" being used as the backing track for the menus.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pvH8SI9ScnquJAWtAyB4dmql2Uf.jpg", "actors": ["Andrea Corr (Lead Vocals, Tin Whistle)", "Caroline Corr (Drums, Piano, Bhodhr\u00e1n, Vocals)", "Sharon Corr (Violin, Vocals)", "Jim Corr (Guitar, Piano, Vocals)", "Keith Duffy (Bass Guitar, Percussion)", "Anthony Drennan (Guitar, Dobro)", "Mitchell Froom (Hammond, Piano)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [36899], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
