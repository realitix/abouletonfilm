The result is an episodic love letter set against the city's intimacies and haunts, populated by old and new acquaintances, while the disembodied voiceover weighs in on gender, animal, and the end of literary culture. Beginning from the position of the body in fugue, Incident Reports traces the most intimate of daily life changes through chronicling a back beat of the city's endless transformation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/crwBdW95IOtstZ2Ybwgb5qMnOtF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
