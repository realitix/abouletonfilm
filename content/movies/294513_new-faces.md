It ran on Broadway for nearly a year in 1952 and was then made into a motion picture in 1954. It helped jump start the careers of several young performers including Paul Lynde, Alice Ghostley, Eartha Kitt, Carol Lawrence, performer/writer Mel Brooks (as Melvin Brooks), and lyricist Sheldon Harnick. The film was basically a reproduction of the stage revue with a thin plot added. The plot involved a producer and performer (Ronny Graham) in financial trouble and is trying to stave off an angry creditor long enough to open his show. A wealthy Texan offers to help out, on the condition that his daughter be in the show.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lZvobYf124ofoLJ2hGJroztAUC3.jpg", "actors": ["Eartha Kitt (Herself)", "Ronny Graham (Himself)", "Robert Clary (Himself)", "Alice Ghostley (Herself)", "June Carroll (Herself)", "Paul Lynde (Himself)", "Polly Ward (Herself)", "Carol Lawrence (Herself)", "George Smiley (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
