TV stations throughout the world become jammed and the image of mild-mannered accountant Norm Jones suddenly appears on every screen. Shortly thereafter, the bewildered man is thrust into an alternate dimension and falls into the Shadoevision Worldview Auditorium where he finds himself strapped into a chair before a live audience. Held captive, Norm is at the mercy of the enigmatic, charismatic master of ceremonies, Djony Dakota.
