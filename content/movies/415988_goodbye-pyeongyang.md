This time, he brings in \u201cSun-hwa\u201d, the sister of a brother who migrated to North Korean from Japan in the beginning of the 1970s. Through \u201cSun-hwa\u201d, it shows the images of the immigrant generation as well as the generation that was born and raised in  North Korea. Although \u2018Sun-hwa\u2019s growth stages are very typical, the specialty of the North Korean society is quietly shown. Through the process of establishing her identity in the North Korean society as an immigrant generation, North Korea isn\u2019t portrayed as simply an unsociable society but as an area on earth which hold the universal image of the human society. This may be said to be producer \u201cYang\u201ds special merit. The picture of family gives a normal everyday life view of the known-to-be different name, North Korea.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tMIcB6s5uWdbO77cphwgiUOhlha.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
