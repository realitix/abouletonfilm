Through a clever combination of the students' video and their mentor Jacek Szaranski's artful camera work, we take a look at the use of video and high tech in a world more commonly associated with a backward and warmongering existence. A world where under the Taliban it was forbidden to show pictures of human beings, let alone for young women to operate video cameras. 'Kites' tells the story of the potential of young Afghans and their yearning for modernity.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
