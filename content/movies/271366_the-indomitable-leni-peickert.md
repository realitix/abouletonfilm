This shorter work, seemingly assembled from leftover footage from the longer film, continues the story of the circus owner Leni Peickert (Hannelore Hoger) after she first abandoned her idea of a radical circus in favor of a job in television. It opens where the previous film left off, at a TV station where Leni and her friends have gathered as employees, attempting to infiltrate the corporate establishment with their own revolutionary ideas. This radicalism is somewhat undercut by the way that Kluge deliberately shoots down the low-cut blouse of one of these young revolutionaries, the camera eyeing her cleavage and then panning down, to the text she's reading, and then back up again, finding her sexuality ultimately much more interesting than her radicalism.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oLbLoal0rhGLyePyNnSy3ww8lb2.jpg", "actors": ["Hannelore Hoger (Leni Peickert)", "Bernd H\u00f6ltz (Herr von L\u00fcptow)", "Sigi Graue (Manfred Peickert)", "Heinrich B\u00f6ll (Diskutierender)", "Martin Walser (Diskutierender)", "Walter Jens (Diskutierender)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
