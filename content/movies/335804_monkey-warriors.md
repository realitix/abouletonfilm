Centuries later in Jodhpur, India, the Hanuman langurs are fighting still. Comprised of 20 or more females and their young, and governed by a \u2018Warlord, \u2018 29 langur \u2018gangs\u2019 have carved up the city between them. Warlords reign for three or four years before they\u2019re overthrown. When a new Warlord comes to power he will purge the gang of young males, creating a society of \u2018Lost Boys\u2019 whose only chance is to violently displace another Warlord. Natural selection is harsh indeed, but what better way to build a culture of warriors?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1Ckkif62h3sYSbZ0N8rQ4RpE69X.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
