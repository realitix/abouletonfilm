They are one of our favorite bands and their performance that day was one of the most hectic, intense and amazing shows we had seen in a long time. While we were hanging out with them here, Ninja and Yo-Landi kept talking about a little monster called Tokoloshe, the most feared of all African demons. Ninja told us about how when he was growing up, his nanny would use a stack of bricks to raise her bed up, just to keep the Tokoloshe away at night. It turns out this is a fairly common practice among women in South Africa since this hairy, pot-bellied dwarf, unlike your typical Western boogiemonsters, is believed to have a penis the size of a horse\u2019s and a penchant for sneaking into people\u2019s bedrooms and raping them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6JeUPGRXweP7ZfMNs5EOnPMGmyg.jpg", "actors": ["Ninja (Himself)", "Yolandi Visser (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
