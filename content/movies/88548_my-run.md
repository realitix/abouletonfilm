He wanted to accomplish the impossible: run 75 consecutive marathons in 75 consecutive days to bring attention to the incredibly difficult lives of single-parent families. He ran in spite of freezing rain and unbearable heat, in spite of chest pains and bone fractures that wracked his 57-year-old body. He just kept running - each day, every day - strengthening an unbreakable bond between father and son--- not stopping until he broke the finish line tape in Atlanta. MY RUN is more than a film about a guy running multiple marathons; it's a film about the daily marathons we all run in life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eHZIhr4zE62u1FHyfIdmJrZhC4I.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
