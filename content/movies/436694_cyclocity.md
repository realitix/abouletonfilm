Seen from the Kennedy viaduct in Nancy (FR), this head-on panoramic view shows a reality that has been partially erased, exposing the urban gap left after the disappearance of the prison and the destruction of a portion of the Centre de tri Postal (the mail sorting center) built by Jean and Claude Prouv\u00e9. What thus appears is an emblematic case of the expressive dimension pertaining to a particular conception of architecture around 1968-73, an intrinsically precarious architecture, marked out for dismantling.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ul5ULKVhxrlkRDpdVzOH9Fn6d6T.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
