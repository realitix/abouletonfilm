Unable to agree, each goes to a sculptor's studio and bribes him to sculpt a bust of the individual favorite. Instead, the sculptor spends their fees on a dinner with his model during which he becomes so inebriated that he is taken to jail. There he has a nightmare, wherein three busts are created and animated from clay (through stop-motion photography) in the likenesses of Democrat William Jennings Bryan and Republicans Charles W. Fairbanks and William Howard Taft. Finally an animated bust of Roosevelt appears.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jOSReHXMV91rsdZ0lxUeeiCVgAb.jpg", "actors": ["Florence Auer (Model)", "Edward Dillon ()", "D.W.
