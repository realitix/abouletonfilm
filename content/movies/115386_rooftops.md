Their one passion is 'combat'. Combat is a dance/streetfight during which the contestants try to push each other out of the arena, while not allowed to actually touch each other. When drugdealers move into the neighbourhood and kill T's best friend he embarks on a mission to eradicate the drug-presence in the neigbourhood. His friends are reluctant to help though, knowing what happened to T's friend when he crossed them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8bFAuHzJZ38EtxbUI3NqQeoTfWS.jpg", "actors": ["Jason Gedrick (T)", "Troy Byer (Elana)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "cDny6wbUgLY"}
