For George Finch, one of nature's white mice and probably the worst artist ever to put brush to canvas, there are many obstacles. Undoubtedly the greatest is his beloved Molly's fearsome stepmother, Mrs. Waddington, who has her eye on an eligible English lord for a son-in-law. Luckily, George has an ally in sharp-witted Hamilton Beamish, an old family friend of the Waddingtons, not to mention George's butler, Mullett, and his light-fingered girlfriend, Fanny, whose valuable skills are of particular interest to the would-be father-in-law.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sX8bAHewfxBPi4OF6V6IEQivrty.jpg", "actors": ["Barbara Kent (Molly Waddington)", "George Beranger (George Finch)", "Carmelita Geraghty (Eulalia)", "Gertrude Astor (Fanny)", "George Davis (Garroway)", "Tom Dugan (Mullett)", "Vera Lewis (Mrs. Waddington)", "Ned Sparks (J.
