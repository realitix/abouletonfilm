With its precise beak and long pink legs the stilt is superbly adapted to the stony braided riverbeads of the McKenzie Country, but it is tragically unable to deal with new threats (rats, ferrets, habitat loss). An early doco for TVNZ\u2019s Natural History Unit, the magnificently filmed drama of the stilt\u2019s struggle for survival makes it \u201cstand out as a classic of its genre\u201d (Russell Campbell). It won the Gold Award at New York\u2019s International Film &amp; TV Festival (1984).", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
