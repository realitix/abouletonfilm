If you're asking \"Why $720,000?\", the answer is: because this Republic programmer is titled $1000 a Minute . Anyway, a couple of cops spot Pryor flashing a roll of bills, and deduce that he's the bank robber they're looking for. For the rest of the film, Pryor must race around to spend his money, while remaining two steps ahead of the Law. The supporting actors in $1000 a Minute are delightfully cast to type, from Edgar Kennedy as a detective to Sterling Holloway as a helpful cabbie.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hYUOd6qITYwpJnVSG1lirEeSMfO.jpg", "actors": ["Roger Pryor (Wally Jones)", "Leila Hyams (Dorothy Summers)", "Edward Brophy (Benny Dolan)", "Sterling Holloway (Pete)", "Edgar Kennedy (Police Officer McCarthy)", "Purnell Pratt (Charlie, the Editor)", "Herman Bing (Vanderbrocken)", "Arthur Hoyt (Jewel clerk)", "William Austin (Salesman)", "Franklin Pangborn (Reville)", "George 'Gabby' Hayes (New Deal Watson)", "Morgan Wallace (Big Jim Bradley)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
