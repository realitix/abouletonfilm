Hell Hath No Fury is a balls-out horror anthology that is a bloody and erotic mix of stories in the style of the horror-lit anthologies. The Hot Blood Series and comedic horror shows like Tales form the Crypt. Spiced with liberal -and very gory- doses of wicked inspiration from classic revenge films like Ms. 45, I Spit on Your Grave, Irreversible, and Last House on the Left, Creepy Six Films' Hell Hath No Fury is a funny, sexy, gory, disturbing and exciting ride into an insanely twisted world where the women scorned exact their vengeance like never before.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oPaIpP0zBf7MY4UhTtYAJJQc9sW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
