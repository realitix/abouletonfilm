The evil Captain Kidd sees the goose and breaks into Felix's house to get it. He brings the goose to his pirate ship. Felix arrives too late to catch the ship. Goldie won't lay for the pirates. Felix sees a cannon and turns himself into a human cannonball to catch teh ship. With help from Goldie and another cannon, he subdues the crew, wrapping them in the sail and depositing them in the hold. He and Kidd have a swordfight, but their swords melt together. Kidd chases Felix up the mast, then foolishly cuts off his own support. He falls into the hold. They sail for home, where Felix fires off cannonloads of gold coins.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bM22utw9nSlqvxh0gxtSfDunGUZ.jpg", "actors": ["Walter Tetley (Felix the Cat (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [59912, 36274], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
