Following the possibly real-life exploits of Josh Kornbluth, an autobiographical monologist, Love &amp; Taxes is a comedy that blends solo performance and scripted scenes to bring the subjective reality of the storyteller hilariously to life. A tale of procrastination, making movies and growing up, Love &amp; Taxes is a middle-aged coming-of-age story that is also, quite possibly, the first ever pro-tax romantic comedy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kJwYUePVOA503HXMpa2Y4XHCGJv.jpg", "actors": ["Josh Kornbluth (Josh Kornbluth)", "Sarah Overman (Sarah)", "Helen Shumaker (Mo Glass)", "Warren Keith (Bob Shelby)", "Robert Sicular (Paul Kornbluth)", "Nicholas Pelczar (David Fuchs)", "Harry Shearer (Sean Boykin/Agent)", "Robert Reich (Sheldon S.
