Streisand sings surrounded by animals in a circus dream sequence and wanders the Philadelphia Museum of Art in a moody eight-minute piece. Filmed in spectacular colour, this companion piece to her first special is one for the ages. The vibrant colours become a metaphor for imagination, inventiveness, fantasy, and sheer brilliance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dBxaLtuRxvtFWUWGO0Csao65wwL.jpg", "actors": ["Barbra Streisand (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "bxHM3MT4Ylg"}
