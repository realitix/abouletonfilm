Reverberating between multi-media versions of the same events, playing with disjunctions between figure and ground, HEAD is a 'trickfilm' meditation on portraiture; the animator, as actor, lives through his drawings, which in turn become actors who influence his own self-image. An insider's diary on the process of creation, HEAD is a brilliant encyclopedic exploration of the circular relationship between the animator and his creation, of the nature of animated illusion itself.\"\r -Thelma Schenkel, Millimeter", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2oIqWo9hYlsNljKuYfJpR85CQZz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
