This game between Willie Park Jr. and Willie Fernie, both Open winners, was the first of a two-part challenge match with a \u0408100 prize up for grabs. If the golf swings are perhaps a little unorthodox today, it's nice to see that the celebrations of the players are unchanged.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
