Thomas Jane and Molly Parker play the parents while Dylan Schmid is on hand as the son, who\u2019s about 15.\r\n\r\nReleased in 2017, \u201c1922\u201d is a haunting crime drama/period piece with elements of horror, unsurprisingly based on a Stephen King story of the same name. The confined farm location, tone and even genre are akin to films like \u201cThe Messengers\u201d (2007), \u201cHusk\u201d (2011) and \u201cSigns\u201d (2002). There\u2019s also a nod to \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d (1967).\r\n\r\nThomas Jane should\u2019ve gotten an award for his performance, as he literally disappears in the role and is unrecognizable. His farm hick accent is so thick I strongly recommend using the subtitles.\r\n\r\nThe themes revolve around disloyalty, the danger of allowing hostility (hatred) to fester, the abuse of authority/manipulation and the power of conscience.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 42 minutes and was shot, believe it or not, in Western Australia. Additional cast: Kaitlyn Bernard appears as the kid\u2019s neighbor girlfriend and Neal McDonough her father.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"}], "recommandations_id": [343674, 433808, 485774, 419479]}
