One of the aliens steals into a cave beneath a temple where the hapless but lovable Magic Lizard appears to be responsible for guarding some kind of treasure. After threatening Magic Lizard with a light saber, the alien makes off with a crystal of some sort, after which Magic Lizard starts with the high-pitched nattering and spazzing out that will characterize his behavior for the rest of the film. He runs to Yuk Wud Jaeng, the demon-like living statue previously featured in both Giant and Jumbo A and Tah Tien and pleads for his help. Yuk Wud Jaeng takes off into the heavens, not to be seen again for some time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4V9k73zvAulUGdlFmjuzUqp3jso.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "gxAYVxLliVU"}
