This film explores what it\u2019s like to be awake against one\u2019s will and the feelings of despair and loneliness that accompany the passing of time. The story is told through the protagonist\u2019s eyes as we drift in a state between wakefulness and sleep through the city at night. The abstract and poetic imagery takes us deeper into the vicious circle of someone's struggle with sleeplessness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4DIgmv6DoWaNeJNj5PKVFTk7jTx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
