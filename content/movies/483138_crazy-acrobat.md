Just as BAP was a superb vehicle for Polly Kuan, so this film gives Chia Ling one of her best roles. However, when Polly was sold to the brothel in BAP, she acted shy and innocent; but when Chia Ling is sold to the brothel here, she behaves like a sexy saucy tease, who is going to have a wonderful time. All her excellent fight scenes are similar to her fights in Female Chivalry: playful and fun-loving, even when outnumbered. If you like Chia Ling, you'll definitely want to see this film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a98Q2DZtSWRHjYCao92lMJzkHs1.jpg", "actors": ["Chia Ling ()", "Barry Chan ()", "Yi Lung Lu ()", "Yi Hung ()", "Man-miao Huang ()", "Hsin Yi Chen ()", "Ching Feng Chiang ()", "Kuang Chao Chiang ()", "Yao Hsiao ()", "Yi-Huo Shen ()", "Wu La-Yun ()", "Su-Chen Yang ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
