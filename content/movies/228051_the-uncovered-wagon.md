In this film a group of people are heading out West to Hollywood so they pack up their \"wagons\" and head out where they must battle various elements including crossing a dangerous river and battling Indians. The \"wagons\" are actually cars with a cover on them and the Indians even ride in on bicycles so you can tell the type of humor that Roach is going for.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8vtufqH03Mi39zico53cMR37nj3.jpg", "actors": ["James Parrott (Bill Bunion)", "Katherine Grant (Mollie)", "Noah Young ()", "George Rowe ()", "Mark Jones ()", "Wallace Howe ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
