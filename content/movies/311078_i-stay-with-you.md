But is it really?... I Stay with You starts out  as an innocent comedy with rich girls having carefree fun. Gradually,  however, the film undergoes a transformation, ending in dark  sadism. Artist Artemio Narro has made a number of installations  and videos on the subject of violence. His first fiction feature is not  only a commentary on the ever-present violence in Mexico, but  also on how we see violence. The changing tone of the film and an  ingenious turnaround in the battle of the sexes makes this film a  confrontational experience.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gwdBhdikclcQyvoZATkpAwT5PkP.jpg", "actors": ["Anajos\u00e9 Aldrete (Ana)", "Beatriz Arjona (Natalia)", "Ximena Rubio (Valeria)", "Flor Eduarda Gurrola (Sof\u00eda)", "Iv\u00e1n Arana (El Vaquero)", "Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Tavira (Diego)", "Diego Luna (Esteban)", "Amaury Jair (Chofer)", "\u00c1lvaro Verduzco (Mike)", "Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Bichir (Luis)", "Luis Reyes Garc\u00eda (Mirrey 1)", "Isaac Elizalde Guitr\u00f3n (Mirrey 2)", "La Juani (Mesera Tiki Tiki)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [39905, 218688], "youtube_key": "gnxIl4PLCqc"}
