One day, Bakti, one of the administrational chairpersons of the neighbourhood suggests bringing Watmo to a mental institution in the suburb. Here, Watmo must live by other people's rules; the rules of the institution. Even though the neighbors and the manager of the shelterhouse meant well, we can\u2019t help to see that there are still many things to be done, before we can consider ourselves a compassionate society. Meanwhile, Watmo seems to decide that eventually, heaven is a state of mind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/odllyBBy2Ds9suaVNwwBCbQl5mo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
