Retiring from a life of train robbing, Benjamin R. Jones (Kohler) takes over the ghost town of Stillwell, knowing full well that the property belongs to Molly O'Rourke (Margaret Lindsay). Enter horse wrangler Tom Mason (Mix), who smells a rat and does his best to unmask Jones as the crook he knows him to be. Molly at first falls for Jones' scheme, but confronts him when a general feeling of lawlessness sets in. The villain, alas, has an ace up his sleeve: Molly owes back taxes on her property, which is ripe for a takeover.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nrM4jqyeHgnooo3Mj6NrBInaTBc.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Mix (Tom Martin)", "Margaret Lindsay (Molly O'Rourke)", "Fred Kohler (Honest Ben Jones)", "Donald Kirke (Henchman Thad)", "Raymond Hatton (Tax Clerk Gabby)", "Buddy Roosevelt (Fancy, the 2nd Horseman)", "Grace Cunard (Mrs. Elmer Brown)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
