Rheinhardt is content to parrot WUSA's reactionary editorial stance on the air, even if he doesn't agree with it. Rheinhardt finds his cynical detachment challenged by a lady friend, Geraldine, and by Rainey, a neighbour and troubled idealist who becomes aware of WUSA's sinister, hidden purpose. And when events start spinning out of control, even Rheinhardt finds he must take a stand.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iSSBM3Q6mY2lAsJgh3d3wpYQah8.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Newman (Rheinhardt)", "Joanne Woodward (Geraldine)", "Anthony Perkins (Rainey)", "Laurence Harvey (Farley)", "Bruce Cabot (King Wolyoe)", "Cloris Leachman (Philomene)", "Jerry Catron (Sidewinder Bates)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [280127, 24392, 49225], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
