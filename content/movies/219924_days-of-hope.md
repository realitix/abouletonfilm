Malraux began shooting his film in 1938 and finished it the following year when the loyalists' hope had definitely dwindled. Espoir is a requiem for republican Spain, a committed film without any references whatsoever to ideology.  --Le monde, 1970 (extract)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qW1VamlSXODhX18TaTP2ouq7oPs.jpg", "actors": ["Andr\u00e9s Mejuto (Captain Munoz)", "Nicol\u00e1s Rodr\u00edguez (Pilot Marquez)", "Jos\u00e9 Sempere (Commandant Pena)", "Julio Pe\u00f1a (Attignies)", "Pedro Codina (Schreiner)", "Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Lado (Peasant)", "Seraf\u00edn Ferro (Saidi)", "Miguel Del Castillo (Gonz\u00e1lez)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [248099], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
