You can see Losey's long-take style in its early stages. If anything, his filming is TOO articulate, tipping his hand and giving away plot turns before they happen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n5AobS1RskWWleCznXoY0Gbc9XZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
