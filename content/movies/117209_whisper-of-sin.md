She is in love with a priest, and the diagnosis of her husband's mental illness leaves no hope. The psychotherapist, in her attempts to resolve the amassed difficulties, seemingly begins to duplicate the life stages and behavioral patterns of her patient. A script for this film is based on motifs from the best-seller, scandalous novel, Witch and Rain, by female author, Jurga Ivanauskaite. By choosing a priest as the main role for a love story, the author broke an existing societal taboo. Faith, Love and Hope form the trilogy by the authors of this screenplay. Love stands as the grandest of the three.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i3HLLfVCjKM8arAwZguKnF3O694.jpg", "actors": ["Aleksas Kazanavi\u010dius (Paulius)", "Remigijus Sabulis (Leo)", "Rasa Samuolyt\u0117 (Vika)", "Nel\u0117 Savi\u010denko (Rita)", "Kostas Smoriginas (Go)", "Romualdas Ramanauskas ()", "Rolandas Boravskis (Doctor)", "Darius Petkevi\u010dius (Policeman)", "Adomas Stan\u010dikas (Prowler)", "Toma Va\u0161kevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 (Daughter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
