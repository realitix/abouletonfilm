In one story, a little fellow has set his heart on buying a sewing machine for his mother. Like the other shoe-shine boys, his goal of saving up money is almost impossible to meet yet after much travail he is finally able to get her a machine. Sadly enough, his triumph is destined to be short-lived when the much-desired sewing machine is broken in an accident. Undaunted, the lad decides the only thing for it is to start again from scratch.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AaUuQnIbNnXjEJ9EBZ6t7uSG8gF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
