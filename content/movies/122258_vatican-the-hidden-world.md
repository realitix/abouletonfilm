With unprecedented access to the Vatican and the people who live and work there, this is a unique profile of the heart of the Catholic Church and the world's smallest sovereign state.  Archivists reveal the Vatican's secrets, including the signed testimony of Galileo recorded by the Inquisition. A cardinal journeys deep below St Peter's Basilica to inspect the site claimed to be the tomb of the saint himself, and curators share a private viewing of Michelangelo's extraordinary decoration of the Sistine Chapel.  An intriguing behind-the-scenes look at the workings of one of the world's most powerful and mysterious institutions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nzlynncVivhu7ljDLcBAcVkZgBm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
