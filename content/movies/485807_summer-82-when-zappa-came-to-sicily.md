Cuccia had a ticket to the concert but never made it.  Thirty years later, collaborating with Zappa's family, he re-creates the events through a combination of rare concert and backstage footage; photographs; anecdotes from family, band members, and concertgoers; and insights from Zappa biographer and friend Massimo Bassoli. The story is also a personal one, as Cuccia interweaves the story of Zappa's trip to Sicily with his own memories from that summer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dVt0UAfWJ2ALvCIlrtRrsZEnPNK.jpg", "actors": ["Massimo Bassoli (Himself)", "Mathilda Doucette Zappa (Herself)", "Joe Travers (Himself)", "Dweezil Zappa (Himself)", "Gail Zappa (Herself)", "Moon Unit Zappa (Herself)", "Diva Zappa (Herself)", "Steve Vai (Himself)", "Tanino Liberatore (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "vnSTDTfhJ-8"}
