Kutz used the film to explore new formal solutions, collaborating closely with cinematographer Jerzy Wojcik to reveal the psychological landscape of a pair of lovers who are strongly affected by wartime events. The camera recorded the couple's inner experiences, contrasting their muted intimacy against the surrounding scenery of a ruined town. The film did not win over critics at the time of its release. It was not until later that critics recognized Kutz's effort to experiment with aesthetics in a manner akin to that pursued by filmmakers of the new wave. NOBODY'S CALLING came to be compared with Michelangelo Antonioni's THE ADVENTURE, which was produced around the same time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8dpdcCDRhm39x30BOfsC2M3ANH3.jpg", "actors": ["Zofia Marcinkowska (Lucyna)", "Henryk Boukolowski (Bohdan 'Bozek' Nieczuja)", "Barbara Krafft\u00f3wna (Niura)", "Halina Miko\u0142ajska (Olga Starenska)", "Aleksander Fogiel (Mayor)", "Ryszard Pietruski (Zygmunt)", "Laura Debicka (Alicja)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
