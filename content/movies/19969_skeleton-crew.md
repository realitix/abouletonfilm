Thirty years later, an American film crew has arrived at the hospital to shoot a horror film based on those awful events. The director, Steven, is determined to make the film as realistic as possible, a goal that doesn't seem too far-fetched when his Finnish sound men discover a hidden room in the hospital basement. There, perfectly preserved, are the original snuff films shot by \"the Auteur\". As Steven's obsession grows, his cast and crew begin to fear for his sanity. But this is only the beginning, because when Steven discovers actual camera used by \"the Auteur\", he assumes the role of the murderous doctor and the real slaughter begins.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iHz6FEeyYoise2WzhCfdjtUVbs4.jpg", "actors": ["Rita Suomalainen (Lisa)", "Steve Porter (The auteur)", "Anna Alkiomaa ()", "Jonathan Rankle (Darius)", "Jani Lahtinen (Klasu)", "Markku Peltola ()", "Olli Koivula ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [298074, 28596, 250792, 246096], "youtube_key": "gdmWA5YRGYI"}
