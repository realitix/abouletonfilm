The film also investigates the nature of sexual transgression, the prejudices of society and how an artist can break boundaries. Further themes arise out of the nature of Noel's work in fetish photography, exploring what the BDSM community is all about, details of the fetish items such as leather, latex, rope, chains, etc and how this is becoming increasingly prevalent in the world of advertising, music and fashion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dQX9deTzHfNTcNovyIOHxvJlqS1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
