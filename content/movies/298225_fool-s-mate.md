Michael Marwitz plays a once-famous concert pianist and chess whiz. He compromises his talents by casting his lot with a group of self-destructive druggies and gamblers. Marwitz' new circle of friends effectively ruins his marriage to Victoria Tennant, an English architect. Fool's Mate makes no effort to cheer up its audience, but this sort of fare apparently is what the European film-festival circuit thrives on.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6WaczS8eLotJdUaMPDw36Pi3LHV.jpg", "actors": ["Victoria Tennant (Alice Gordon)", "Mareike Carri\u00e8re (Judy Miller)", "Mathieu Carri\u00e8re ()", "Peter Sattmann (Hausemann)", "Harry Baer ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
