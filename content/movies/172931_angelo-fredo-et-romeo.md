The resulting controversy concerned questions of indiscriminate government funding of such obviously terrible material. Written by Francois Camirand and Pierre Plante, who also made his directorial debut with the film. The story centers on dopey, dull-witted Fredo who has inherited his late uncle's shipping company. Con artist Angelo is his racquetball partner. Angelo has doggedly been trying to convince Fredo that he is a famous film producer so Fredo will invest in his latest film. This sets Fredo to dreaming about films and these daydreams comprise the basis of the parody sketches that attempt to make fun of such genres as martial arts films, gangsters flicks, sexy Italian romances, and one scene where the filmmakers combine The Piano with Crocodile Dundee.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mpBSNR4Gb9xTCbdeiDmGEv4cSQy.jpg", "actors": ["Beno\u00eet Bri\u00e8re ()", "Martin Drainville ()", "Luc Gu\u00e9rin ()", "Macha Limonchik (Isabelle)", "Amulette Garneau ()", "Donald Pilon ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
