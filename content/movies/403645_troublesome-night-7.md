During their stay at the village, the crew hears eerie and horrific voices during the night and witnesses a phantom roaming around the premises. In addition, some feel that their feet were being tickled while in the water performing. The villagers attest that their territory is not haunted, but an old villager, familiar with the village's past, sheds light into the mystery.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yHX62OQRA8Kz5ua5okRrkgsUSUq.jpg", "actors": ["Louis Koo (Lok)", "Simon Lui (Detective Lui)", "Amanda Lee (Amanda Li)", "Nadia Chan (Ying)", "\u9ece\u8000\u7965 (Alex Cheung)", "Frankie Ng (Hung)", "May Law Koon-Lan (Fa)", "Celia Sze Lim-Tse (Yu)", "Hui Siu-Hung (Tat)", "Michael Tsui (Keung)", "Helena Law Lan (Granny Ping)", "Angela Pang (Lai)", "Gregory Lee Wing-Ho (Ho)", "Oscar Leung (Crazy person)", "Gordon Leung (Gordon)", "Cub Chin Kong-Hon (Village Chief Nam)", "Eileen Yeung ()", "Tong Ka-Fai ()", "Lee Wai-Ki (Kenji)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
