When the gangsters infiltrate the theatrical troupe, Don Vincenzo commands them to put on a performance of \"The Tempest\" in order to separate the thugs from the thespians. Writer-director Cabiddu draws inspiration from both Shakespeare and Eduardo de Filippo, the great Neapolitan playwright whose influence is seen in the film\u2019s enchanting mixture of the earthy and the fanciful. Veteran actor Rubini excels as the hangdog leader of the troupe, but the real star of the film is the unspoiled island of Asinara off the northwest tip of Sardinia.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z9GS5GdTDXnuLGN8fIKURnAL16W.jpg", "actors": ["Renato Carpentieri (Don Vincenzo)", "Sergio Rubini (Oreste Campese)", "Ennio Fantastichini (De Caro)", "Jacopo Cullin (Tenente Franci)", "Teresa Saponangelo (Maria Campese)", "Alba Ga\u00efa Bellugi (Miranda)", "Luca De Filippo (Capitano)", "Francesco Di Leva (Andrea)", "Maziar Firouzi (Ferdinando)", "Fiorenzo Mattu (Antioco)", "Adriano Pantaleo ()", "Ciro Petrone (Saverio)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [392832, 79395, 52124, 207270], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
