It reveals much more what it is that all the \u201crescues\u201d hide, right up to the present day tragedy of Greece. The radical alteration of society in Europe. The transformation of private debt into public debt which has been papered over and presented as a \u201crescue\u201d has not only driven democracy to absurdity. It has shaken societies which consider themselves socialist societies with rule of law to their foundations. No one formulates this better in the film than Mario Draghi, who as a one time vice president of Goldman Sachs and present president of he ECB steers the economies in the Euro area: \u201cThe European social model is history\u201d. \u201cSaving the Euro will cost a lot of money. That means we will have to take leave of the European social model\u201d. For seven years now the rescue is taking place with the help of hundreds of Billions of public money.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1V4H6Xn04tMRrcdD9dYUMfaACVQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
