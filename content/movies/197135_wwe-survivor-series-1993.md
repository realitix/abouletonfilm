The event featured four tag-team elimination matches and a bout for the Smoky Mountain Wrestling Tag Team Championship. The main event match saw the All-Americans, a team of face wrestlers from the United States, competing against the Foreign Fanatics, a team of heels that represented other countries. In an undercard match, four members of the Hart family competed against Shawn Michaels and a group of masked men. The original plan was for the Harts to face Jerry Lawler, with whom they were feuding, but Lawler was not able to appear at the event.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wxybjff0Puu7bKSKl9GISLxJqIw.jpg", "actors": ["Mark William Calaway (The Undertaker)", "Lawrence Wendell Pfohl (Lex Luger)", "Robert Rechsteiner (Himself)", "Scott Carl Rechsteiner (Himself)", "William Moody (Paul Bearer)", "Rodney Anoai (Yokozuna)", "Brian Adams (Crush)", "Jacques Rougeau (Quebecer Jacques)", "Harry Fujiwara (Mr. Fuji)", "Solofa Fatu Jr. (Fatu)", "Samula Anoai (Samu)", "Scott Charles Bigelow (Bam Bam Bigelow)", "Afa Amituana'i Anoa'i (Afa)", "Bret Hart (Himself)", "Owen James Hart (Himself)", "Michael Shawn Hickenbottom (Himself)", "Greg Valentine (The Blue Knight)", "Randy Savage (Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage)", "Scott Hall (Razor Ramon)", "Sean Michael Waltman (1-2-3 Kid)", "Lawrence Michael Rotunda (Irwin R.
