The spectacle in the film takes place in a much more basic sense. Right at the start, we see a camera tripod left standing, and instead, the filmmaker has set off to track down a woman (artist Martina L.). Carefully, concealed\u2014with a thoroughly male-coded gaze\u2014she approaches the unsuspecting woman who is out taking a walk. What we are then shown, a close-up of a woman urinating, activates a quasi-childish delight in investigating taboos: Evident here are both a conscious reference to Viennese Actionism and the counterpart to one of Gr\u00f6ller\u00b4s early films, Boston Steamer (2009) about the process of anal excretion. Yet rather than the close-ups of anatomical details and the associated sexualization, what is actually `unsettling\u00b4 about Im Wiener Prater is the gaze forced upon the viewer: this woman looks at us, questioning and self-confidently\u2014now that\u00b4s pure cinema of attraction.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
