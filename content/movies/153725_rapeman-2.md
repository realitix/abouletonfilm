People want revenge Rapeman style, they go to the Uncle, and if it's rape worthy, Rapeman does what he does best. Anyways in Rapeman 2, Rapeman Co. has realized that the hospital and the mafia are somehow related and they decide enough is enough. What follows is even more of what you wouldn't expect from a movie called Rapeman. It's full of kind and silly humor but also inserted with a some serious emotional scenes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/CVhX7Te9eISpkaDZtuMKQ6tm0w.jpg", "actors": ["Hiroyuki Okita (Keisuke)", "Sakae Umezu (Uncle Shotoku)", "Atsuko Takano ()", "Miyuki Tanigawa ()", "Hiroya Morita ()", "Hitomi Okazaki ()", "Fumihiko Ikeda ()", "Yoshimi Yokosuka ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
