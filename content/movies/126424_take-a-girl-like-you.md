Jenny is a traditional Northern working-class girl whose striking good looks are in sharp contrast to her prosaic upbringing, and to her strong belief that a girl should preserve her virginity until her wedding night. Because of her attractiveness, Jenny's views on virginity and marriage cause conflicts. The film centres on the (increasingly desperate and cruel) attempts of Patrick Standish, a 30 year old schoolmaster at the local grammar school, to seduce Jenny, against a backdrop of his skirmishes with his school authorities and with the shabby, suburban middle class milieu in which the film is set.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9a7QU0JCgD4XB1Bg4G3vfqePacN.jpg", "actors": ["Sienna Guillory (Jenny Bunn)", "Rupert Graves (Patrick Standish)", "Hugh Bonneville (Julian Ormerod)", "Robert Daws (Dick Thompson)", "Emma Chambers (Martha Thompson)", "Jeff Rawle (Mr. Charlton)", "Amelia Warner (Shiela Torkingham)", "Marsha Fitzalan (Lady Dot Edgerstone)", "Leslie Phillips (Lord Archie Edgerstone)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
