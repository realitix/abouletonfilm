The film reflects the moral decline of the society, where stealing in secret and making compromises against one's beliefs make up mundane reality. The filmmakers went to perhaps the furthest possible limits in terms of allowed social criticism in the 1980s. The negative picture is enhanced by its rural setting, since the Slovak village had been traditionally associated with strict morals and conservative values.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8pFu6BZRfbv8bT2KQixXo2wSqUv.jpg", "actors": ["Maro\u0161 Kram\u00e1r (Peter Hradil)", "Gy\u00f6rgy Cserhalmi (Jones)", "Zlata Adamovsk\u00e1 (Marta Vlachov\u00e1)", "Wilhelm Perh\u00e1c (Vantuch)", "Tomas Zilincik (Karol)", "J\u00e1n Sedal (Francek)", "Rudolf Hru\u0161\u00ednsk\u00fd (Edo)", "Ivana Ch\u00fdlkov\u00e1 (Inge)", "Ivan Pal\u00fach (Gryga)", "Josef Hruby (Vajzer)", "Kov\u00e1cs J\u00f3zsef (Innkeeper)", "Michal Moncek (Driver)", "Jana Plichtov\u00e1 (Wife of the Jones)", "Marta Raslov\u00e1 (Wife of the Ed)", "Franti\u0161ek Veleck\u00fd (Gambler)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
