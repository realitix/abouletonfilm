This mindful tale centers on the emperor of China and his pet nightingale, which sings like an angel but isn't much to look at. The songbird is a favorite of the royal court, but everything changes when the emperor gets a bejeweled mechanical nightingale. Other stories include \"Jack the Fool\" and \"The Galoshes of Fortune.\"", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
