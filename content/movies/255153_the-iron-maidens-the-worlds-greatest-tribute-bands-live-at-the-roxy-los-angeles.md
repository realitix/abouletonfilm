Having formed nearly 12 years ago, the band has repeatedly toured the world over, recorded DVDs, CD and has earned the respect and admiration of some of the top names in the business.  This is a group of accomplished musicians.  Never mind the funny stage names and obvious references \u2014 this is a great band that properly pays tribute to the music of Iron Maiden.  As promised (and as witnessed during several of The Iron Maidens\u2019 shows in the last month), this show delivered.  The stage set, the music, the adoring fans \u2013 this is what heavy music is all about.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hDUOirqKhO30aezcHaNxNtRPTQS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
