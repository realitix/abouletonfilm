We take it all.\" The shop serves as a gathering place for employees and regular customers, who come with troubles in hand. One summer day, part of the shop's sign falls down. Yojiro thinks this is a sign that something spectacular is about to happen, and indeed their problems take on lives of their own from that day onward.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gRg9L3BU7PMSOskG66IA1XnJyNK.jpg", "actors": ["Kiyohiko Shibukawa (Yojiro)", "Ryu Morioka ()", "Sairi Itoh ()", "Kenichi Takito ()", "Toshie Negishi ()", "Kimiko Yo ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
