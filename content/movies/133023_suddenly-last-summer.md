Sebastian's mother, Violet Venable, trying to cloud the truth about her son's homosexuality and death, threatens to lobotomize Catharine for her incoherent utterances relating to Sebastian's demise. Under the influence of a truth serum, Catharine tells the gruesome story of Sebastian's death by cannibalism at the hands of locals whose sexual favors he sought, using Catharine as a device to attract the young men (as he had earlier used his mother).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5Ciri8djD5qZ0LNepUbwwSxAy99.jpg", "actors": ["Maggie Smith (Violet Venable)", "Natasha Richardson (Catharine Holly)", "Rob Lowe (Doctor Cukrowicz)", "Richard E.
