Both were music entities. Robert Schumann turns out to have been a second tier composer, if that, never rising to the heights of a Beethoven or Mozart. In contrast, Clara Wieck was a master technician in the playing of the piano, a composer (probably not at Schumann's level), and was a child prodigy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bfPbwX3sQMl4otYsIgmorF94Gr.jpg", "actors": ["Herbert Gr\u00f6nemeyer (Robert Schumann)", "Nastassja Kinski (Clara Wieck)", "Rolf Hoppe (Friedrich Wieck)", "Marie Colbin (Dame in Paris)", "Andr\u00e9 Heller (Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy)", "Margit Geissler (Christel)", "Edda Seippel (Mutter Schumann)", "Bernhard Wicki (Baron von Fricken)", "Friedrich W.
