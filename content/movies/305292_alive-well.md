Subjects in the film range from a young woman hoping to start a family, to a mother taking care of her symptomatic 6 year-old son and ailing husband; the drummer of a major country music band, a former NBC News journalist turned HD-advocate, as well as a renowned scientist relentlessly searching for a cure. Far from giving us a hopeless glimpse into life with terminal illness, Alive &amp; Well reminds us all of our ability to persevere with strength, despite life's most difficult challenges.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9NvbnwRa9BVO25gBVm7HWZo1wcz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
