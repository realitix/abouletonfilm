Hawaii just got an incoming nuclear missile threat and because of our new leader, people believed it. We have lost our way as a country. The world thinks we\u2019re a joke and there\u2019s a joke in the most powerful position in the world. I would give my yakuza pinkie right now for Mitt Romney. All that being said the new show is a killer balance between right and left. Thoughtful conservatives and my Grandma are starting to realize that we made a mistake. AMERIGEDDON is bringing the country together one drunk audience at a time. It\u2019s for all of us because it takes one side, The side of America. Don\u2019t worry about anything people! It\u2019ll be okay, we will survive, or live in a post apocalyptic gasoline fueled thrill ride where tribes fight each other over who should lead...just like now, except we\u2019ll all have Mohawks.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/59VEdzHLyNkomUmN6GR5jUBCVfw.jpg", "actors": ["Christopher Titus ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "KU1abO8nJf8"}
