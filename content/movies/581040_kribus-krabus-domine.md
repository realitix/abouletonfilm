Lisa is eight and spending the summer with her parents in the mountains. But the much-vaunted beauty of nature provides the young girl with little comfort in the sparse Alpine landscape. Instead, it seems eerie. Her father is often away and her mother is always busy with washing and doing the dishes. Lisa watches and fantasises about being far away \u2013 ideally in Persia. In the South Tirolean dialect, \u201ckribus krabus\u201d means \u201ctopsy turvy\u201d. The \u201cdomine\u201d in the title stands for the opposite, for God, control, and power.
