Maybe not so much for Psilander's acting, but for the sensational, action-packed storylines that he was in. This film shows the other side of Psilander's fame: his daring. He was an excellent rider and looked fantastic in long riding boots and elegant riding jackets and this skill was exploited in his films.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b8swwOSYuV32PJghk5c2jV1mcdJ.jpg", "actors": ["Frederik Christensen (Sagf\u00f8rer)", "Aage Hertel (Cirkusdirekt\u00f8r Winge)", "Alma Hinding ()", "Frederik Jacobsen (Gamle John - tjener hos greven)", "Agnes Lorentzen ()", "Axel Mattson (Cirkusrytter)", "Lauritz Olsen (V\u00e6rtshusg\u00e6st)", "Valdemar Psilander (Grev Willy von Rosen\u00f6rn)", "Jenny Roelsgaard (Danserinden Miss Evelyn)", "Ellen R\u00e6der (Skolerytterske Mlle Dor\u00e9)", "Valda Valkyrien ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
