Desperate to be someone in life---and to pay off his debts---he embarks on a journey into the increasingly magnetic world of Evangelical Christianity. Religion seems to offer a quick path to becoming rich and soon Gonzalez is willing to do anything in his power in order to make it happen. A thriller that evokes the gritty style of Martin Scorsese\u2019s Taxi Driver, Gonzalez: The False Prophet is a suspenseful ride through the darker side of charismatic preachers and upstart religions that flourish on the hard-earned money of desperate people in need of hope.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
