Most of the concert footage was taken from a show at the Los Angeles Universal Amphitheatre on 2 September 1974. There were also excerpts from D.A. Pennebaker's concert film Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, which had been shot at London's Hammersmith Odeon on 3 July 1973, as well as a few other performances from the tour. Cracked Actor is notable for being a source for footage of Bowie's ambitious Diamond Dogs tour at the time he was a cocaine addict and also for showing Bowie's fragile mental state during this period.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/orYQsqWBIJFUPs7XUDTKhIacrA0.jpg", "actors": ["David Bowie (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [260800, 131344, 256803, 185633], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
