When they decide to move to a small provincial town in Germany, Stevie attempts to slip into a normal life. Whilst her parents playfully escape their responsibilities, Stevie tries to make a good impression in town, spreading stories of grandeur and claiming to be the daughter of a diplomat. She makes progress. Yet the good weather doesn\u2019t last and before long, she discovers that her parents have once more resorted to illegal means, as a way of supporting their leisurely lifestyle. As friends and hangers-on of her parents fill their new home, the chaos continually mounts. It is in this atmosphere of physical and emotional destruction, that Stevie must now start to define herself and perhaps even break free.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9r1kO8jnGs1POAYtclYBA8cXVI5.jpg", "actors": ["Ceci Chuh (Stevie)", "Birol \u00dcnel (Axel)", "Pascale Schiller (Lily)", "Georg Friedrich (Ingmar)", "Joana Preiss (Louise)", "Joseph Malerba ()", "Johanna Gastdorf ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
