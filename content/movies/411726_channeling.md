In Donegan's almost psychedelic renditions, a silver-garbed, red-wigged performer capers in a theatrical non-space of foil, plastic, police tape, and rescanned video images of Tommy star Ann-Margret. In Channeling in 4 Versions, actress Garland Hunter enacts the scene, and then, in a silent version (Channeling in 5 Versions), Donegan herself takes the role.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gJIbDmAFmJiPoiZPRBxDH1WnduA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
