Karen and Wes's marriage is crumbling apart - like a sandcastle. Karen can't even make love to her husband any more - the sand has managed to get everywhere. Harry, a tax collector, is a witness to this marriage falling apart. As a civil servant he hears Wes confession. However he isn't able to help him. The omnipotent eye of television glitters above the desert - that raw allegory of America where neither the white nor the black have it good. If Samuel Beckett and Joan Collins had a romance, then their child would look like this film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cAR8jwWWjePYNGCUKTSh7VHVrLM.jpg", "actors": ["Viggo Mortensen (Wes)", "Jennifer Rubin (Karen)", "Andy Rivera (Mick)", "Alhassane Barry (Secret Service)", "David Baty (Secret Service)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
