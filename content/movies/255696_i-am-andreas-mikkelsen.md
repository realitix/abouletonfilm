Because despite my young age, I truly have a story to tell.  This summer, I sat down with a camera crew in our workshop to share some incomprehensible lows and truly inspiring highs. This short documentary offers a rare glimpse into the heart and soul of my life. I\u2019ve been aiming for WRC since I was a child. A story of having everything \u2013 and loosing it all.  The documentary runs for twelve minutes and features never before-seen private home video, Skoda material, Volkswagen material and shots by my long-lasting friend and photographer Nino Minic.  I hope you like it!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5JzYwa3Dthykq2VABZ4VffJR4wA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
