{"tmdb_id": 28779, "title": "Pinocchio", "original_title": "Pinocchio", "slug_title": "pinocchio", "date": "1971-01-01", "genre": [""], "score": "6.0/10", "synopsis": "This is a bawdy burlesque version of the famous fairy tale. Instead of Gepetto, the old-man woodcarver, we have Geppeta, an apparently frustrated and nubile young virgin. Geppeta carves Pinocchio for herself as a gorgeous young hunk. Geppeta's fairy godmother, a blonde played by Dyanne Thorne, magically transforms the young stud Pinocchio into a living man, who is quickly brought to work in the local whorehouse as a prize stud and exhibitionist. Nothing -- not even sex -- is taken seriously in this lighthearted, semi-pornographic offering. The film was originally rated X, but was later re-edited and given an R by the MPAA in 1977", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fJt55LEOLmHT11JiLn9VpyJVLej.jpg", "actors": ["Alex Roman (Pinocchio)", "Monica Gayle (Gepetta)", "Dyanne Thorne (Fairy Godmother)", "Karen Smith (Mabella)", "Debbie Osborne (Angelica)", "Vincene Wallace (Beatrice)", "Neola Graef (Carlotta)", "Gwen Van Dam (Madame Suburbia)", "Uschi Digard (Lilly (uncredited))", "Sandy Dempsey (Sex Show Girl (uncredited))", "Casey Larrain (Sex Show Girl (uncredited))", "Barbara Mills (Sex Show Girl (uncredited))", "Anna Travers (Sex Show Girl (uncredited))", "Carolyn Brandt (Sex Show Viewer (uncredited))", "Ruthann Lott (Party Girl (uncredited))", "Michael Donovan O'Donnell (Party Guy (uncredited))", "Lynn Harris (Loving Woman (uncredited))", "Chris Warfield (Party Guest (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
