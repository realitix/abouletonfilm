The participants in the 2007 final were incumbent champions England and South Africa.  The match itself was try-less with each team scoring only penalties. This gave South Africa a 15\u20136 victory. It also meant that of the five countries to have appeared in a Rugby World Cup final, South Africa is the only one that has not lost a final, and the only one not to have scored a try at the final stage. Each team did have one major try scoring opportunity; South Africa's came late in the first half, while England's came early in the second. England wing Mark Cueto was denied a try in the 42nd minute after he was ruled to have put a foot in touch during a tackle by Danie Rossouw before grounding the ball after a TMO review. Later independent analysis showed this to be the correct decision.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nlgl6HXlRSKIvq7Xx2fEcx9RykC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
