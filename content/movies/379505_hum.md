A woman stands in the dilapidated room. The woman has come here in search of silence, of escape. From the urban din, the constant noise of her life. To silence the voice of a lover recently lost. She wants to leave behind even the possibility of communication. But she discovers that her search for silence is impossible. The closest she comes is playing a dumb piano into a still afternoon. Finally she goes in search of sound, to experience it in its full intensity, at deafening volume.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Kerry Condon ()", "Lalor Roddy ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
