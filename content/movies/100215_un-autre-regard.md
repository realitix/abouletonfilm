In 1958, the body of Eva Szalanczky, a political journalist, is discovered near the border. Her friend Livia is in hospital with a broken neck; Livia's husband, Donci, is under arrest. In a flashback to the year before, we see what leads up to the tragedy. Eva gets a job as a writer. She meets Livia and is attracted to her. Livia feels much the same, but as a married woman, has doubts and hesitations. In their work, they (and Eva in particular) bang up against the limits of telling political truths; in private, they confront the limits of living out sexual and emotional truth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d2k2I1fm4m0Q6rhwIY3Xp0nlRli.jpg", "actors": ["Gra\u017cyna Szapo\u0142owska (Horv\u00e1th Livia)", "Jadwiga Jankowska-Cie\u015blak (Szal\u00e1nczky \u00c9va)", "Ildik\u00f3 B\u00e1ns\u00e1gi (Szal\u00e1nczky \u00c9va (voice))", "Judit Hern\u00e1di (Horv\u00e1th Livia (voice))", "Jozef Kroner (Comrade Erd\u00f5s)", "Gyula Szab\u00f3 (Comrade Erd\u00f5s)", "Andorai P\u00e9ter (D\u00f6nci Horvath, Livia's husband)", "\u00c1d\u00e1m Szirtes (Major Blindics)", "Judit Pog\u00e1ny (Magda)", "Reviczky G\u00e1bor (Fiala, a journalist)", "D\u00e9nes Ujlaky (T\u00e9eszeln\u00f6k)", "Ferenc B\u00e1cs (Szlabonya)", "\u00c9va Ig\u00f3 (waitress)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [129933, 43969, 52555, 242288], "youtube_key": "TzES5Bc0PvI"}
