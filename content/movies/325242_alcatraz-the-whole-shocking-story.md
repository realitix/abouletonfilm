Michael Beck plays the real-life Clarence Carnes, an Oklahoma Choctaw Indian said to be the youngest man ever incarcerated in the notorious maximum security prison. Serving a 99-year sentence for a gas station holdup and murder, Carnes makes periodic attempts to escape, the final attempt being the most violent. Many of the subordinate characters are fictional (as are most of the details concerning Carnes' escape efforts); the one exception is Robert Stroud, the \"Birdman of Alcatraz\", here portrayed by Art Carney as a gentle, kindly philosopher. Telly Savalas, a costar of the Burt Lancaster vehicle Birdman of Alcatraz, also guest starred in the 1980 film. Originally titled Alcatraz and Clarence Carnes, this made-for-TV movie wavers between gritty realism and \"I'm bustin' outta here!\" artifice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pQwwMhj966GS4ZcGvKtnTlLbI8w.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Beck (Clarence Carnes)", "Art Carney (Robert Stroud)", "Alex Karras (Jughead Miller)", "Telly Savalas (Cretzer)", "Will Sampson (Clarence's Father)", "Ronny Cox (Bernard Coy)", "Richard Lynch (Sam Shockley)", "Robert Davi (Hubbard)", "John Amos (Bumpy Johnson)", "James MacArthur (Walt Stomer)", "Ed Lauter (Frank Morris)", "Joe Pantoliano (Ray Neal)", "Louis Giambalvo (Clarence Anglin)", "Jeffrey Tambor (Dankworth)", "Paul Mantee (Ordway)", "G.
