Alexandra is beautiful, intelligent, rich, and completely insufferable. Self-centered and patronizing, she\u2019s an expert in quick put-downs, nasty name-calling, and brokering gossip into profit. Alexis is a simple-minded, pure-hearted, and hard-working gal who is constantly bullied by her future sister-in-law\u2019s family with whom she stays.
