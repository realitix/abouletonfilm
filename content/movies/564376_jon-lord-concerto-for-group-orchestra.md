He finalized his very last mission - the first and only studio recording of the famous Concerto For Group And Orchestra.  Lord assembled guest musicians such as Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson, Joe Bonamassa and Steve Morse in the Abbey Road Studios, to work with his trusted partner, director Paul Mann, on the 2012 version of the legendary concert.  The studio recording of Concerto For Group And Orchestra will now become Jon Lord's legacy for generations to come.
