The next day, he's the first in line to get his at the store. But they won't sell him one! \"These are women's coats,\" the store owner says. \"For women only!\" On the grounds that the newspaper ad constitutes a contract, the customer takes the vendor to court to win his right to the coat. Understanding the Law: The Coat is episode one in a series of short, funny films designed to demystify everyday aspects of Canadian civil law. Wry humour and a whimsical style make this informative series lively and memorable.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kvQRi1XsZdvcAZBHVBGZBNfoflX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
