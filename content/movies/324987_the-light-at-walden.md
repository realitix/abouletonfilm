The filmmaker, as a young man during the U.S. / Vietnam War, attempts to follow Thoreau's principles: building a cabin and living sustainably in the woods, \"to front only the essential facts of life.\" This is one story among the nearly 125,000 war resisters in Canada.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1tHYDrDxBdGLesyaxDQVSoMxEv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
