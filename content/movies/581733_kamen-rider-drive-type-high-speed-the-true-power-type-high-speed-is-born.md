This investigation puts them against the \"mastermind\", Roidmude 027, who during battle manages to copy Drive's equipment, becoming Imitation Drive! Now facing the opponent who has all of his skills (not true) and is just as powerful (also not true), Shinnosuke doesn't know what to do, when Mr. Belt comes up with a novel idea - to upgrade all of Drive's equipment to much higher standards. And so, Kamen Rider Drive ascends into High Speed!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pFLAQFT1FxZijP4yQjBu429EOMM.jpg", "actors": ["Ryoma Takeuchi (Shinnosuke Tomari / Kamen Rider Drive)", "Rio Uchida (Kiriko Shijima)", "Rei Yoshii (Rinna Sawagami)", "Yuu Inaba (Go Shijima / Kamen Rider Mach)", "Kenta Hamano (Kyu Saijo)", "Chris Peppler (Drive Driver (voice))", "Tomokazu Seki (Roidmude 027 (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "WH161ouaE8g"}
