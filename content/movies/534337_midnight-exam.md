But she gets to know Roland, a bachelor farmer who develops an instant burning passion for her. Prepared to do anything for her, he goes as far as to holdup banks to secure the good life she longs for. Although she confesses (wrongly) that she suffers from AIDS, he is in no way discouraged. S\u00e9r\u00e9na accepts to marry Roland but on her wedding night she balks at taking the \"midnight exam\". She runs away and meets Antoine, a married writer, who hides her in the attic of his house, without his wife knowing it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h2dpHxV4cz5OxJBuSmAsR4JvDZD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
