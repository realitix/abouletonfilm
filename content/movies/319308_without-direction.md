Teo is a gay musician from the southeastern region of Guatemala, who longs to go to America. On his way to Mexico he is brutally attacked after a group of men discover he's gay and ends up in the hospital of a small town. There he meets Ray, an American doctor, who abandoned his country after accidentally killing one of his patients. The fate of each of the characters is altered after they meet, challenging their beliefs about the ideal country and questioning their decisions for fleeing.
