Following a brutal assault by a gang of bikers in connection with some of his more shady dealings, Markus opts for voluntary solitary confinement among the prison's weakest inmates; the rapists and the pedophiles. This ward has a prison choir, of which the inmate Niels is the unofficial and self-proclaimed leader.
