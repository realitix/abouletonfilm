Since adolescence they have managed to produce over thirty low-budget movies in which they often have played the main characters. Their movies are not only the sum of their fears and desires, but also a way of projecting an image of themselves towards their own community and the outside world. When one of them decides to radically change his life, their friendship and the future of their common cinema goals are threatened.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z607zMdn64lH3kyxTo8eUQBan1y.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
