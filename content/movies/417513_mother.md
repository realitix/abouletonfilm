People live along a narrow passageway. And there lives an old woman named Lee So-sun which means a small fairy. Ever since the death of her oldest son, Jeon Tae-il, she always lived sympathizing with the pain and sword-like life of her neighbors. Lee So-sun was the mother of all who waited for a 'humane world', standing straight in the world having no fear of anything. Young artists Baek Dae-hyun and Hong Seung-hee express the pain Jeon Tae-il and his mother Lee So-sun had to endure through their performances. What would be the meaning of Lee So-sun's life to these two artists who beautified all her pains in life? This work is about the final message left by the 'mother'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pXGN9oSbZihgQM9Fm9zJgACUdJ7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
