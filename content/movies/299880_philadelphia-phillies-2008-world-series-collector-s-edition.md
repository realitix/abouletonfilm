It's exciting to revisit the Phillies' comeback in the eighth inning of game four, when they were down 5 to 3 but rallied on home runs by Shane Victorino and Matt Stairs. Watching winning pitcher Cole Hamels shut down the Dodgers in game five demonstrates why he was named series MVP. Moving on to the Phillies' domination over the Tampa Bay Rays in the World Series, this box set neatly packages each game on its own disc in a plastic case covered in vital information: player statistics, the temperature during the game, stadium attendance, etc. Additionally, each disc includes the option to listen to alternative broadcasts of a game, one from the Phillies Radio Network, the other from the Rays' equivalent.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
