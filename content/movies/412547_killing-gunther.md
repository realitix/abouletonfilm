Unfortunately, it's also indicative of _Killing Gunther's_ biggest problem: Leading the promotional material with Arnold Schwarzenegger. I know, from a marketing standpoint, it makes a hundred and five percent sense, totally get it. But purely in terms of the experience you go through from watching a movie, I feel absolutely certain that _Killing Gunther_ would have been exponentially better if Arnie's involvement was kept secret. It seems very much as if the movie was built that way, and then the direction was changed some time after post-production.\r\n\r\nIn the end, _Killing Gunther_ is an okay movie, but it might have been **great** if the Gunther character was a genuine reveal in the film, instead of the \"Fuckin' finally\" moment we ended up with.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"}], "recommandations_id": [311307, 416160, 471429, 414454], "youtube_key": "ROusT3QDlZ0"}
