But it\u2019s definitely fun to be reminded about stuff that\u2019s gone. Remember Winky\u2019s hamburger joints? All the drive-in theaters that used to be around here? The Gazebo restaurant in Shadyside? Did you ever sit up late listening to Party Line on KDKA radio? Or stop to gawk at the KQV window? Remember when you could wave goodbye at the old Greater Pittsburgh Airport? Or cheer for the Pittsburgh Maulers? Did you know there once were some 17 or 18 inclines in this area? We celebrate all that and more in this program (a follow-up to Things That Aren\u2019t There Anymore).", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
