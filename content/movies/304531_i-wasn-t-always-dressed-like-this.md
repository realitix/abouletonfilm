Its practice and meaning have been greatly abused throughout history. Within the context of the West the question one might ask: \"In a free country, why are women choosing to veil?\" In a very intimate and meditative mode, three Muslim women reflect around issues of cultural memory, identity, self-censorship, feminism, politics and media.
