When the gang quickly dispenses with the two brothers in a blitz home invasion, their third brother, returning from ten years of wandering, arrives and teaches the gang a lesson they'll never forget--that is, if they survive at all!  Henchman after henchman gets filleted like a brook trout as our hero literally cuts his way through a jungle of sword-wielding thugs, a trio of fancy-weapon gang leaders, and a masked ninja assassin that's killing people on both sides. Who will be left alive to claim the treasure? Find out in this high body-count wuxia classic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8t7vhBE6z7RwoJZOsfDXqwEcYUR.jpg", "actors": ["Lui Ming ()", "Lam Ching-Ying ()", "Lam Chi ()", "Tin Yau ()", "Ling Wan ()", "Wong Yung ()", "Ko Hsiao Pao ()", "Yee Yuen ()", "O Yau-Man ()", "Kuo Chun Chen ()", "Chong Lai ()", "Chiu Chen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
