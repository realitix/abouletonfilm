She uses a reflection in the window to create a mnemonic trace. The figure weaves the embryo of a story, between surrender to ennui and waiting (for someone who does not arrive?), but the actual aim seems to capture the viewer's interest to the point where the window's mirroring effect can perform its function: here she's beyond the reach of the camera's gaze, but even there she's inaccessible yet present. Sonnet evokes sound, only to deny it. Its literary title sets the tone for a formal appraisal of the work. The expectation of regularity, of density and form that produces meaning is maintained to the extreme brevity of the work combined with its slow pace.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6XH7fxvsF7bqMUey3yJn7LSahbz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
