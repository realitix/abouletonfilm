We go inside the peloton, we\u2019re pushed up impossible climbs and forced down rapid descents, we lie alongside him in his hotel room in post-race agony. We ride in the support car, the source of comfort, supplies and fleeting relief from the cold. And we know that every mile traveled is a mile closer to the end.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/osITztQ0YR1ItZ6vzt4WNF4UKZ8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [520330, 424722, 481845, 386028], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
