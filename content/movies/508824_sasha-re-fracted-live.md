To help him, he pulled together a team that included longtime collaborators Charlie May, Dennis White, Dave Gardner, with technical help from Barry Jamieson and behind the scenes advice from the immensely experienced Tommy D \u2013 who\u2019s worked with everyone from Right Said Fred to Jess Glynne \u2013 and whose wife Rosie Danvers led Wired Strings for both shows. Alongside this core team, orchestral percussionist Joby Burgess and vocalist Julie Daske were added, as well as a plethora of guest singers that included John Graham and Abigail Wyles.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sgLaiYHMUbjO1E6AbTsq43yfDhP.jpg", "actors": ["Sasha (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "BZz0o82ikLM"}
