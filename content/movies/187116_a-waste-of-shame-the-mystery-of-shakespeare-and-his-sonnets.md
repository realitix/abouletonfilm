What are the identities of \u201cthe young man\u201d and \u201cthe dark lady\u201d to whom all but two of the sonnets allude? This moving performance brings to life the gritty reality of Shakespeare\u2019s England, bits of the Bard\u2019s plays and poems, and the consummate poet and dramatist himself as it exposes these personages unseen but so keenly felt in Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets and in his life. Rupert Graves, Tom Sturridge, Indira Varma, Anna Chancellor, and Zo\u00eb Wanamaker star. Contains mature themes and explicit language. Some content may be objectionable.
