Entering Turkey on foot through a snowy, Kurdish-controlled pass, the pair again take their lives into their hands and face suffocation when they are locked in a freight container on a ship bound for Italy. From there they plan to travel on to Paris, the Sangatte refuge centre and ultimately asylum in London.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l7mvqj7YEqVya75kGNzEQULNgdI.jpg", "actors": ["Jamal Udin Torabi (Jamal)", "Enayatullah (Enayat)", "Imran Paracha (Travel Agent (Pakistan))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [62333, 58905, 162514, 9643], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
