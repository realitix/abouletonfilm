The odyssey is a homecoming for singer Chhom Nimol and a transformation for the rest of the band as they perform with master musicians and record new songs along the way. More than a rockumentary, the film serves up a portrait of modern Cambodia as the band tours through Phnom Penh and beyond, crossing a great cultural chasm with the same spirit of Cambodia's original rock pioneers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3RyfGAqnhnA9XMAjKVGqbNZY3Rr.jpg", "actors": ["Ethan Holtzman (Himself)", "Zac Holtzman (Himself)", "Chhom Nimol (Herself)", "David Ralicke (Himself)", "Paul Dreux Smith (Himself)", "Senon Gaus Williams (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
