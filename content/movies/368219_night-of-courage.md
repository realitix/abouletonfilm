Now it's believed that he sought out sanctuary in the house of a man (Hughes), and that the man threw him out. And it's also believed that the boy being Hispanic was probably part of a gang and that the whole thing was gang related, so the police don't consider any need to investigate the incident. But a teacher (Kelly) doesn't believe this, and sets out to find out what happened that night by talking to the man, but he doesn't want to talk about it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7RL779RegWnpGRPQVlya1diiWI7.jpg", "actors": ["Daniel Hugh Kelly (Paul Forrest)", "Barnard Hughes (Abner Abelsen)", "Geraldine Fitzgerald (Abby Abelsen)", "Lili Taylor (Marina)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
