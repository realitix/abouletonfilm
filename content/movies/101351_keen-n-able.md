Once again Shane McConkey, Miles Daisher, JT Holmes, and Australian Chris McDougal raise the bar that they alone have set. Ever see a Mister Bill, a jumper holding onto another jumper while the one jumper deploys? Maybe, but I bet you've never seen it done on a B.A.S.E jump, with one guy not wearing a parachute!!! Or how about a B.A.S.E. jump Mister Bill followed into a downplane? Sound scary, you bet it does. Ever see a single engine propeller plane with bent props and wonder how they got that way? Watch one of these guys and his \"perfect landing\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dVSNlWp9Dt3FN4vHFxGwWl81oqq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
