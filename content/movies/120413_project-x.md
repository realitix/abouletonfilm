Keith Andes plays an ex-Communist who is strongarmed into cooperating with the Feds. Pretending to become a \"comrade\" again, Andes rejoins the local Communist cell. Moving about freely, he is able to track down a gang of spies who are smuggling atomic secrets. Filmed on location in New York, Project X has the surface \"feel\" of a documentary, though the dialogue is strictly from the funny papers. Keep an eye out for a very young Jack Lord.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wpDK9V2Sfu3jdjoFTD2gMVqVfU3.jpg", "actors": ["Keith Andes (Steve Monahan)", "Rita Colton (Sandra Russell)", "Jack Lord (John Bates)", "Kit Russell (Michael Radik)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
