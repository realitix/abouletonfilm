Csaba (Karoly Eperjes) has just come out of doing a stint in prison because he stabbed a man while drunk, and when he goes home he discovers that his wife (Mariann Erdos) is now living with someone else in their apartment. Csaba quickly divorces his wife but he still has to move in and share a kitchen and bathroom with her and her new mate, suffering because he still loves her. This untenable situation is complicated by visits from Csaba's mother, and by various women he starts seeing, as well as by a busy-body neighbor. The three main roles of Csaba, his wife, and her lover (Peter Andorai) are excellently interpreted in this satire on social mor\u00e9s and economic realities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/er36SfDtAvZ7PiuXSm1RgVZzwP9.jpg", "actors": ["K\u00e1roly Eperjes ()", "Mariann Erd\u0151s ()", "Andorai P\u00e9ter ()", "Gergely Bik\u00e1csi ()", "Frigyes Holl\u00f3si ()", "Edit \u00c1brah\u00e1m ()", "Erzsi Cserhalmi ()", "N\u00f3ra G\u00f6rbe ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
