This is the story of Olmo whose mother left his father when he was young and is brought up to believe she is dead. The father and son live under an Argentine dictatorship and live in a warehouse spending their days cataloging and archiving anything and everything from toys to chairs and a vast collection of subversive propaganda. After the father's sudden death, Olmo sets off in the real world with the help of a young woman he has met to Galicia, Spain clutching a postcard that his mother had sent from there many years before.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mYaDylGYTQG8iC9aeV50pg0Zzbu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
