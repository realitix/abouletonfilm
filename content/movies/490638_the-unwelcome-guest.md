After her death, her husband, believing himself penniless, has to leave their old home and move in with his son's family, where he's treated with no respect or consideration. Also on the scene is a newly-hired kindly young housekeeper. She and the old gentleman become close friends and eventually run away together (taking the old shipping trunk with them).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lgavoBr6UU1GwJGxuoUi7x2uolJ.jpg", "actors": ["Mary Pickford (Jessie - the Slavey)", "W.
