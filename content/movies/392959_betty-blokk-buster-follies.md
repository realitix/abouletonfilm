Flashing her bum at the audience was the capper gag for the routine. Livemore's other characters included Vaseline Amylnitrite, a football star who joins the Australia Ballet, and an old man who recalls his youth as a trendy male model.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vJ9UMdMCp9k4yPNMZ6hV6BLKetN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
