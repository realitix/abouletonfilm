Schaller's lovely and sometimes deeply emotional, 63-minute journal/essay film offers a look at the making of the Wausau, Wisconsin classic, including interviews with the one surviving cast member and the relatives of others who appeared in the movie.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1Zp80YcKbEOsjEj4EhwJFRNPk6D.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
