When father dies, stern son Hindley returns and bans Heathcliffe to the stables; when they spy upon their upper class neighbors, Edgar Linton sends the dogs upon them and chases Heath but starts an affair -love comes only from him- with her. When Hindley's socialite wife Frances dies in childbirth, he is completely embittered, becomes a drunk unable to care for his son Hareton and has to sell Wuthering Hights- to Heathcliffe. After a misunderstanding Cathy marries Linton, Heath retorts by a loveless match with his sister. Even Cathy's death doesn't stop the cycle of spite, grief and harm so it poisons the next generation's lives as well while she keeps haunting Heathcliffe", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1wpPuM8XRFxxY6OjlfSvZqC0qqO.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Cavanah (Heathcliff)", "Peter Davison (Joseph Lockwood)", "Orla Brady (Cathy)", "Matthew Macfadyen (Hareton Earnshaw)", "Sarah Smart (Catherine Linton)", "Tom Georgeson (Joseph)", "Flora Montgomery (Isabella)", "Crispin Bonham-Carter (Edgar)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [30092, 32111, 21997, 109614], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
