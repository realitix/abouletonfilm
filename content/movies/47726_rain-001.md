Sometimes we don\u2019t even see it coming. We get hit with some form of pain out of nowhere leaving us feeling desperate and helpless. That\u2019s the way life is. Still, it makes us wonder how God can let these things happen to us. How God can just stand by and watch us suffer. Where is God when it really hurts? Maybe God is actually closer to us than we think. Maybe it\u2019s when we\u2019re in these situations, where everything seems to be falling apart, that God gets an opportunity to remind us of how much he really loves us.
