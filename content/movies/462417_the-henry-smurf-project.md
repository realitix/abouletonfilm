During the filming of the movie there were some tragic incidents, such as the disappearance of six people or the violent deaths of another three. Some of these incidents were registered on video but couldn't see the light because of the ongoing legal battle between the director and the victim's families opposing its screening. On the contrary, Elvira Serio director of the movie, thinks that what is on the tape could be of great help shedding some light over all the mysteries around this thread. She hopes that her work can serve as a warning as well to all the residents and tourists who often visit that place.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9sbRmWuzxnYfXxXuzuJ9wQjMLtl.jpg", "actors": ["Cristian Casarrubia ()", "Julieta Greco ()", "Iv\u00e1n Quinteros ()", "Estrella M\u00e1rquez ()", "Alan Kevin M\u00e1rquez ()", "Wechi De Quinteros ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
