From the heat and uncertainties of Brazil to the cliff-hanging finale in Portugal some 16 races later, the season was a winner in terms of drama, interest and excitement.  1984 was also the year the racing world witnessed a new name soon to be on everyone\u2019s lips: Ayrton Senna.  For Lauda, the eventual winner, the title was a particularly sweet one as it came seven years after his previous title in \u201877. Prost\u2019s achievements were just as impressive, winning a record seven races to finish within a point of Lauda at the end.  New fuel rules gave all teams plenty to think about and in Germany the N\u00fcrburgring\u2019s rebirth gave drivers a new challenge to consider.  The story of the season is brilliantly narrated by Clive James.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Clive James (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
