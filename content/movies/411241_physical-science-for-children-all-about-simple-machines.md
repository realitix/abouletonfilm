Six simple machines are presented using fun, real-life demonstrations and clear, colorful graphics: the lever, the wheel and axle, the pulley, the inclined plane, the screw and the wedge.  Learn more about these simple wonders, and see how they are the basis for most of the world's tools and machines.  Includes a fun, hands-on activity that lets kids test these ideas themselves by using an ordinary see-saw.  This program is based on the concepts outlined in the National Science Education Standards for Physical Science.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
