While its subject and year of production might suggest a propaganda film, Shangrao has garnered some interesting (if chronologically impossible) comparisons to Bresson from some critics for its intense, haunting minimalism, though its true roots are in the Soviet cinema then widely distributed in China; in particular, the great cinematographer Zhu Jinming offers a brilliant echo of Dovzhenko's overwhelming landscapes in his images of China's rugged northern climes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jNt9PK7s9I8pT7BSwiyB6hVSZKS.jpg", "actors": ["Tang Hua-Da ()", "Zhiang Jun ()", "Lu Min ()", "Lu Min ()", "Zhou Liangliang ()", "Lin Nong ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
