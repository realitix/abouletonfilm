Dressed in loud attire and speaking with big-city accents, they stand out considerably from the locals. As they travel through the islands, they meet a variety of eccentric figures and colorful characters, including their families. Bye Bye Bluebird was screened at the 1999 Haugesund Film Festival. ~ Jonathan Crow, Allrovi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2a6hLAOccQ1X9KXk2NiLENEPbfp.jpg", "actors": ["Hildigunn Ey\u00f0finsd\u00f3ttir (Rannva)", "Sigri Mitra Ga\u00efni (Barba)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
