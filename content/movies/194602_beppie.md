Van der Keuken once described her as follows: 'She was ten years old and the joy of the Achtergracht, where I was living at the time. An Amsterdam child, sweet and crooked as a corkscrew.' He films her while she skims the city with some friends and knocks at strangers' doors. Her family has nine children and is not well off. In those days, a visit to the De Miranda swimming pool cost a quarter, but only ten cents if the weather was bad. At school, Beppie gets a poor mark because she is too boisterous, but when the whole class rattles off the multiplication tables, she joins in at the top of her voice. All of TV-watching Holland was wildly enthusiastic about this portrait, with which Van der Keuken even made the front page of the national newspaper De Telegraaf.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w44lTBD8qfUGSDF54xQj3U3gv7d.jpg", "actors": ["Ed van der Elsken ()", "Gerda van der Elsken ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [88302, 76388, 134220, 203226], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
