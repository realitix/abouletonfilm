Jean, who is now an executive with the store, has since fallen out of love with Jeff, however, and is dating Walter Medcraft in the accounting department. As Jean never returned the engagement ring that Jeff sent to her while he was away, Jeff believes that she is still his fianc\u00e9. Realizing that Jeff is about to get his heart broken, Dilworthy and other department employees band together and, with Jean's consent, work diligently to prevent Jeff from learning the truth about his failed engagement.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pwxqo0clc8mr8wMM59uog1g1PM.jpg", "actors": ["Donna Reed (Jean \"Chunky\" Kendrick)", "Tom Drake (Jeff Compton)", "Edward Everett Horton (Hiram Dilworthy)", "Spring Byington (Miss Mary Swanson)", "Sig Ruman (Professor Boris Riminoffsky)", "Harry Davenport (Great Grandpa)", "William 'Bill' Phillips (1st Barfly)", "Margaret Hamilton (Miss Applegate)", "Hobart Cavanaugh (Mr. Wilson)", "Warner Anderson (Walter Medcraft)", "Connie Gilchrist (Mrs. Murphy)", "Fred Essler (Nikolai)", "Wilson Wood (Henry Stute)", "Barbara Billingsley (Mary)", "Dwayne Hickman (Eddie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "sG26SYMhNI0"}
