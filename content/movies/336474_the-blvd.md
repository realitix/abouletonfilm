This is a rambling, textured film about obsession. It is about the mythos of speed for its own sake, and it is about waiting. While waiting, The BLVD exposes community, inner-city landscapes and nomadic experiences of place. The film treats storytelling as a living medium for determining history. And it commands respect for those who transform cars, or anything else, through passion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i8p816PfMBznThYfygmdELFgJk3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
