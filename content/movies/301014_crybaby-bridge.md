With the help of their camera man Craig and the funding of the National Gun Owners of America, they are given the chance at a trial run, a documentary about the hunting experience. But when they cross the bridge and into the woods beyond, the hunters find themselves in the midst of the legend of Elizabeth, a vengeful specter willing to do whatever it takes to be reunited with her lost child. As the documentary progresses, the strange events continue to escalate to a deadly climax. Can the hunters save themselves from becoming the hunted, or are they doomed to be become a permanent part of the legend of Crybaby Bridge?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4SNNKFTPpG8Gd4vxJVgQp3iySoZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
