With editing completed by filmmaker Ken Kobland, Chuck Close lives the life and work of a man who has reinvented portraiture. Close photographs his subjects, blows up the image to gigantic proportions, divides it into a detailed grid and then uses a complex set of colors and patterning to reconstruct each face.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kvQHU0L8zDXLRGbGA6u14rcpQ8O.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
