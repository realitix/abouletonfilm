The films offered Crockwell a chance to experiment with various unorthodox animation techniques such as adding and removing non-drying paint on glass frame-by-frame, squeezing paint between two sheets of glass, and finger painting. The individual films created over a nine-year period were then stitched together for presentation, forming a nonsensical relationship that only highlights the abstract qualities of the images. \u2014Kansas City Electronic Music and Arts Alliance", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fC5o94PWfhFApZo11losMHedBhp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [154818, 163102, 145619, 209680], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
