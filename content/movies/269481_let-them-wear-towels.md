After a very public fight, the door was opened, but the debate about female journalists in the male sanctum of the clubhouse remained. Through interviews with pioneering female sports writers, Let Them Wear Towels captures the raw behavior, humorous retaliation, angry lawsuits and remarkable resolve that went into the struggle for equal access for women reporters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AtINGptZRUxCB0xMBsvw6mQSwOp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "UUzVjx4R5t4"}
