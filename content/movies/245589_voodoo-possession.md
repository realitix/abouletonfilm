For believers and skeptics alike, there is nothing in this world or the next to rival the relentless evil of a Voodoo Possession. Burdened since childhood with a gnawing sense of guilt, cynical Aiden Chase journeys to a Haitian insane asylum in search of his missing brother. Upon arriving, he discovers all the inmates and the hospital administrator (Danny Trejo, Machete) are seemingly possessed by a bloodthirsty voodoo spirit. Now, Aiden must abandon reality and descend into a terrifying spirit world to try to rescue his brother - or they will both be damned for eternity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/61ftOfyVbUuRfb5VmKLS94HehkS.jpg", "actors": ["Danny Trejo (Kross)", "Marie-Fran\u00e7oise Theodore (Dr. Yveline Montase)", "Ryan Caltagirone (Aiden Chase)", "Kerry Knuppe (Bree Nelson)", "David Thomas Jenkins (Cody Chase)", "Treva Etienne (Jean Drouillard)", "Tomas Boykin (Happy Man)", "Dominic Conti (Bob)", "Darius Devontaye Green (Ewenso Simon)", "Catherine Haena Kim (Penelope 'Peanut' Garcia)", "Nancy La Scala (Helen)", "Sloane Morgan Siegel (Young Aiden)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [223732, 150889, 21119, 231082], "youtube_key": "CMSDNmWGQQE"}
