Marsha Jordan - the first real star of Sexploitation - is Sweet Georgia, the sex-crazed nympho wife of rancher Big T. Unfortunately, because Big T is an ugly, abusive drunk, Georgia looks for her lovin' elsewhere - starting with Cal, the stud ranchhand, then moving on to Virginia, Big T's daughter, who spends her days riding her horsey in the nude. Of course, since Georgia's only Virgina's stepmom, the two think a little down-home girl-girl action is perfectly fine, especially around a romantic campfire. But when Georgia makes it with dumb ol' Leroy, everything gets violent. Yup, just when you think you've got this film figured out, an accidental death somehow escalates into one grisly murder after another.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4bNyPjE2UDpY0k6Dlc87TT5Fk8a.jpg", "actors": ["Marsha Jordan (Georgia)", "Barbara Mills (Virginia)", "Gene Drew (Big T)", "Chuck Lawson (Cal)", "Bill King Jr. (Le Roy)", "Al Wilkins (Jack)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
