In 18th century Yorubaland, Prince Oluyole is taken prisoner in the course of internecine warfare fanned by overseas slave traders. He is sold into slavery in Brazil. In present day Nigeria, at his father's deathbed, the young Babatunde promises to go to Brazil and search for traces of their once-enslaved ancestors. Beginning with a Candombl\u00e9 ritual, his journey takes him ever deeper into this culture and, in a dream-like sequence, affords him a deeper understanding of his ancestors' suffering and powers of resistance. Balogun effortlessly links present with past, real with magical worlds and discourse with trance. The hypnotic atmosphere is also heightened by the music of the Nigerian drummer Remi Kabaka, which plays with repetitive patterns and distortions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jLe7gd15YtsF6xBaAL5noVv8rex.jpg", "actors": ["Z\u00f3zimo Bulbul ()", "Ant\u00f4nio Pitanga ()", "Milton Vilar ()", "Jorge Coutinho ()", "Clementino Kel\u00e9 ()", "Emmanuel Cavalcanti ()", "Ivan de Almeida ()", "Sonia Santos ()", "Roberto Pirillo ()", "L\u00e9a Garcia ()", "Neuza Borges ()", "Maria das Gra\u00e7as Almeida ()", "Ruy Polanah ()", "Kim Negro ()", "Aniceto do Imp\u00e9rio ()", "Cl\u00e9a Sim\u00f5es ()", "Neuza Amaral ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
