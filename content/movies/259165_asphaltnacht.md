Angel (Gerd Heinemann) heads out to the streets of Berlin in his drag-racer to revitalize his flagging creativity. He is desperately trying for a new song that refuses to surface. He meets scrappy Johnny (Thomas Davis) on the streets and saves him from everyone he tends to alienate: cops, motorcycle gangs, and passers-by. Johnny has his guitar with him and is the first to break Angel's deadlock. A tune he plucks out is just the beginning that Angel was looking for. The rest of the song lies out there somewhere and the two head into Berlin's night spots to find it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w68AP2l6Ff2ke1xLnLEm3RwWWsr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
