With modern day interviews and archival footage, the documentary discloses the personal struggles and triumphs that classic Afro-Italian, African-American and Afro-descendant actors faced in the Italian film industry, while mirroring their struggles with those of contemporary actors who are working diligently to find respectable, significant, and non-stereotypical roles, but are often unable to do so. BlaxploItalian is more than an unveiling of a troubled history; it is a call-to-action for increased diversity in international cinema through the stories of these artists in an effort to reflect the modern and racially diverse Italy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2t0WFV56cT96J4Z2Adv2yOJTHvI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "i487Nq84WMA"}
