He despairs that the show will close after opening night until an ingenious writer suggests that he simply give the production snob-appeal by making the tickets nearly impossible to get by fabricating a story that they were all purchased by a flamboyant Texas oil baron who is totally besotted by the show's star, Faye. Unfortunately things go haywire when a young fellow suggests that the writer (who impersonates the oilman) sign to a lucrative advertising contract. Songs include: \"You're a Sweetheart,\" \"My Fine Feathered Friend,\" \"Who Killed Maggie?\" \"Scraping the Toast\" and \"So It's Love.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j1c1WNeLOoeuNyW16Fgf0f50avU.jpg", "actors": ["Alice Faye (Betty Bradley)", "George Murphy (Hal Adams)", "Ken Murray (Don King)", "Charles Winninger (Cherokee Charlie)", "Andy Devine (Daisy Day)", "William Gargan (Fred Edwards)", "Tony Labriola (Oswald)", "Frank Jenks (Harry Howe)", "Frances Hunt (Penny)", "Casper Reardon (Cousin Caspar)", "Donald Meek (Conway Jeeters)", "David Oliver (Yes Man)", "A.A.
