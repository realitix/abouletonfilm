Kelly's 'Hip-Hopera'. Discovering a new direction for the music video, the singer has taken the soap-opera format and applied it to the narrative in his songs, with characters mouthing the lyrics. Due in no small part to the 'bling culture' associated with this style of music, the resulting 'plot' involves lots of infidelities, guns, and gorgeous women, wrapped up in a daytime TV feel. Opinion is divided on whether it's meant to be as funny as it is. THE BIG PACKAGE!!!"}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "2DhYXsCvIww"}
