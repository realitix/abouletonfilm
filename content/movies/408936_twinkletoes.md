Twink meets Chuck Lightfoot, a noted prizefighter, who falls in love with her at first sight. She tries to avoid falling in love with Chuck, whose wife, Cissie, is a drunken harridan and more than a little bit spiteful. Meanwhile, Twink has secured a job in a singing-dancing act in a Limehouse theater, under the auspices of Roseleaf, who has more than just a protective interest in the girl. The jealous Cissie discovers that Twink's sign-painting father also has a night job as a burglar, and she turns him into the police. While a big success dancing on the stage, the arrest of her father has left her somewhat down in the dumps, and she decides to toss herself into the Thames. Possibly, the now-free Chuck, since Cissie has been killed in an accident, might come along and rescue her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2NKPNFCA0CC11O8Na9qs7xGTt4q.jpg", "actors": ["Colleen Moore (Twink 'Twinkletoes' Minasi)", "Kenneth Harlan (Chuck Lightfoot)", "Tully Marshall (Dad Minasi)", "Gladys Brockwell (Cissie Lightfoot)", "Lucien Littlefield (Hank)", "Warner Oland (Roseleaf)", "John Kolb (Bill Carsides)", "Julanne Johnston (Lilac)", "William McDonald (Police Inspector Territon)", "Dorothy Vernon ()", "Ned Sparks ()", "Dick Sutherland ()", "Carl Stockdale ()", "Aggie Herring ()", "Harold Lockwood ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
