Former Partisan Miha is trying to tell a shocking story from the war times in the modern day disco club, where young people are having fun in a crazy rhythm of music with alcohol and drugs... Amongst the many issues this film explores are the following questions: Does the desire for pleasure and amusement always gain the upper hand against moral convictions and man's sense of responsibility and guilt? What things are worth sacrificing your life for? Are moral second thoughts and the search for the truth stronger than man's endless search for instant pleasure? Is the experience of war truly that which turns a boy into a man? And does love truly redeem death?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4kVWy4lp42Vqg4YcazDJ7RWPip9.jpg", "actors": ["Ivica Vidovi\u0107 (Damjan)", "Jasna Andronja (Ana)", "Jo\u017ee Zupan (Martin)", "Janez \u0160kof (Miha)", "Janez Er\u017een (Je\u017eovnik)", "Andrej Nahtigal (Mure)", "Boris Cavazza ()", "Mirko Bogataj ()", "Boris Juh ()", "Milena Zupan\u010di\u010d ()", "Slavka Glavina ()", "Alenka Svetel ()", "Andrej Risti\u010d ()", "Fanika Podobnikar ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
