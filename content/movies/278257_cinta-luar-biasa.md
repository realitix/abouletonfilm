A decade later, Farah is a successful photographer, Hamidah is an entertainment magazine columnist, Husin has become a cameraman and Adam is a music tutor. A comedy of errors follow when the bunch, who each has personal problems, meet in Pulau Langkawi. Farah\u2019s busy schedule does not permit her to fall in love, though she is acquainted with Halim, a bright but bumbling lawyer. Then there\u2019s Husin who has sacrificed much while taking care of his paralysed mother. Hamidah, on the other hand, has long fancied Husin, and dresses to kill for the reunion and does everything she can to attract his attention. As for Adam, he has a jealous girlfriend in Aleya who is envious of the close ties between her beau and Farah, though the duo\u2019s relationship is purely platonic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bP7tkj5pL9VReWcpFCzch9XPphH.jpg", "actors": ["Nasha Aziz (Farah)", "Saiful Apek (Husin)", "Hans Isaac (Adam)", "Syanie (Hamidah)", "Ako Mustapha (Halim)", "Erma Fatima (Cik Lulu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "XfgPD3QvAuc"}
