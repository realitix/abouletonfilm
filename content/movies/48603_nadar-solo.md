In search of some happiness, Martin takes off to the coastal town of Mar de Plata, where his older brother lives. Unglamorous, yet enchantingly addictive and refreshingly genuine, Acu\u00f1a paints a confused and uncomfortable world, and makes us want revisit it over and over again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zQKINAGn2kSFXZ0QJEDbI95GKeM.jpg", "actors": ["Nicol\u00e1s Mateo (Mart\u00edn)", "Santiago Pedrero (Guille)", "Tom\u00e1s Fonzi (Tom\u00e1s)", "Antonella Costa (Luciana)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
