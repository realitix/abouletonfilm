LIVE AT THE FILLMORE draws most heavily from that self-titled disc and the Los Angeles collective's 2004 outing, STREET SIGNS, with rock, funk, pop, and hip-hop elevated by the group's potent Latin rhythms. Ozomatli's performances do not disappoint; in fact, these tunes often outshine their studio counterparts, since they offer an added shot of spontaneity and energy. Ozomatli: Ra\u00fal Pacheco (vocals, guitars); Asdrubal Sierra (vocals, trumpet, keyboards); Justin \"El Ni\u00f1o\" Por\u00e9e (rap vocals, percussion); Jabulani Smith-Freeman (rap vocals); Ulises Bella (clarinet, saxophone, keyboards, background vocals); Sheffer Bruton (trombone, background vocals); Wil-Dog Abers (electric bass, background vocals); Mario Calire (drums); Jiro Yamaguchi (tabla, percussion); DJ Spinobi (turntables).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z7WjGHEGVajaudsOT6EXiPqzq7C.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
