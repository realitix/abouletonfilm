Alas, all he gets is screws, rocks, and other useless stuff. He plays outside a rich man's window, and the spoiled brat kid inside decides he wants Pluto. Mickey isn't selling, but when his bass gets destroyed by a passing sleigh and he sees a house full of orphans with no presents, he changes his mind. Mickey plays Santa to the kids. Meanwhile, the brat has been torturing Pluto; his father finally has enough and throws Pluto out and spanks the child. Pluto and Mickey are reunited, and as a bonus, the kid has tied the Christmas turkey to Pluto's tail.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kBbzuHIFZ6B2PBgnp2qjDuf1Sa0.jpg", "actors": ["Walt Disney (Mickey Mouse (voice) (uncredited))", "Pinto Colvig (Pluto (voice) (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [64662, 67607, 67111, 66876], "youtube_key": "ANlOFyhZJSI"}
