She has renounced to her freedom and her life.  But very soon, with the help of her cell mate, the girl understands that the life in the convent is not so bad.  In the convent, the sisters stimulated by a seclusion not always chosen by themselves, they try to be free with their secret and repressive desires. So a sex orgy will involve even the gardener, the Confessor, the altar boys and everyone who has the possibility to enter the convent. But all the sisters who are thristy of sex will be inflicted the right punishment. That's only an excuse to make new perverse and sadism games and to live a sexual life with no limits.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zmtO6kHNSnP1A0oZDIm1N2Yqq0r.jpg", "actors": ["Maria Bellucci (Maria (as Maria))", "Roberto Malone (Monk)", "Judith Kostner (Nun (as Judith))", "Lady Roxy ()", "Prisca (Mother Superior)", "Alex Mantegna (Monk)", "Levente ()", "Philippe Dean (Music Teacher)", "Frank Gun (Servant at Maria's home)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
