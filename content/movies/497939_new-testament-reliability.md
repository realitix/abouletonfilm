Dr. James White of Alpha and Omega Ministries has authored over thirty books, participated in over 100 public debates and written countless articles for Christian publications. Dr. White is one of the evangelicalism's great minds. Dr. White will show you why you can trust that your Bible is the Bible that was inspired by God and written by men thousands of years ago.  You will not only see actual Biblical manuscripts, but you will see how they compare to manuscripts of Plato, Pliny and Julius Caeser. You will conclude: no other ancient book has the manuscript support that the Bible does.  The next time someone accuses you of believing in a book that is inaccurate, you will be ready with a clear, powerful, precise response.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/afxltA8fWWnWs6koAwRL2Dfx4Hr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
