The show is set in Japan beginning in 1853 and follows the difficult westernization of Japan, told from the point of view of the Japanese. In particular, the story focuses on the lives of two friends caught in the change. The original Broadway production of Pacific Overtures in 1976 was staged in Kabuki style, with men playing women's parts and set changes made in full view of the audience by black-clad stagehands. It opened to mixed reviews and closed after six months, despite being nominated for ten Tony Awards.Set in 1853 Japan, Pacific Overtures follows the Westernization of Japan, mainly through the story of Kayama, a samurai, and Manjiro, a fisherman. The lives of both men are radically changed by the coming of American ships to Japan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tFOhuhXhYUqDoTETujQiB0yqjOd.jpg", "actors": ["Mako (Reciter / Shogun / Jonathan Goble)", "Soon-Tek Oh (Tamate / Samurai / Storyteller / Swordsman)", "Yuki Shimoda (Abe - First Councillor)", "Sab Shimono (Manjiro)", "Isao Sato (Kayama)", "Alvin Ing (Shogun's Mother / Observer / Merchant / American Admiral)", "Ernest Harada (Physician / Madam / British Admiral)", "James Dybas (Second Councillor / Old Man / French Admiral)", "Mark Syers (Samurai / Thief / Soothsayer / Warrior / Russian Admiral / British Sailor (as Mark Hsu Syers))", "Patrick Kinser-Lau (Shogun's Companion / Dutch Admiral / British Sailor / Girl)", "Ernest Abuba (Samurai / Adams / Noble)", "Timm Fujii (Son / Priest / Girl / Noble / British Sailor)", "Haruki Fujimoto (Servant / Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry)", "Larry Hama (Williams / Lord of the South)", "Jae Woo Lee (Fisherman / Sumo Wrestler / Lord of the South)", "Freddy Mao (Third Councillor / Samurai's Daughter)", "Tom Matsusaka (Imperial Priest)", "Freda Foh Shen (Shogun's Wife)", "Ricardo Tobia (Observer / Proscenium Servant / Sailor / Townsperson)", "Gedde Watanabe (Priest / Girl / Boy)", "Conrad Yama (Grandmother / Sumo Wrestler / Japanese Merchant)", "Joey Ginza (Proscenium Servant / Sailor / Townsperson)", "Leslie Watanabe (Girl / Proscenium Servant / Sailor / Townsperson)", "Susan Kikuchi (Proscenium Servant / Sailor / Townsperson)", "Dingo Secretario (Proscenium Servant / Sailor / Townsperson)", "Kim Miyori (Proscenium Servant / Sailor / Townsperson)", "Kenneth S.
