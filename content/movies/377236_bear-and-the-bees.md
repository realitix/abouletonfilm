Fatso, now smitten, is determined to win her affection but his clumsiness threatens the relationship of the two, despite Cupid's advice. He dumps a trash can on her head, shoves a bouquet of flowers in her face, knocks her in the mud, dumps a beehive on her head, and knocks her into a cave. Finally, he succeeds in winning her with \"the caveman routine\" only to discover she has a family of kids he must now look after. Furious, he vengefully chases Cupid into the distance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nfrLWuOPH7UvgXjVIFSxpFndidj.jpg", "actors": ["Dal McKennon ((voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
