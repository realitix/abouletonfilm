In something of a cross between a Keystone Kops comedy and an Edwin S. Porter melodrama, Lady Liberty, Justice (with her blindfold and scale) and Death form a love triangle, with fickle Death getting his comeuppance in the end. The marvelous musical soundtrack by Nik Phelps and live audience reactions to the film make this a warm and fuzzy experience, despite the archetypal gravity of the main characters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8xCZ3G3CLg23lV28Iliek1ygipe.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
