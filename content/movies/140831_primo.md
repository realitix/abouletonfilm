When it opened in September 2004 at the National Theatre PRIMO was instantly recognised as a major theatrical event. A work of astounding dramatic power it sheds a light on one of the darkest episodes in human history. Antony Sher's towering performance is as controlled as Primo Levi s own lucid prose. Beautifully directed by Richard Wilson and presented in Hildegard Bechtler's magnificent, symbolist set.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nZ58ZnnAcjOomj4MWj9y4Lk0Qr2.jpg", "actors": ["Antony Sher (Primo Levi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
