In preparation for a live album, Nashville singer-songwriter Mark Collie and a film crew roamed the vast expanses of Brushy Mountain for months meeting inmates, many of whom are talented singer-songwriters. It is the remarkable stories of these talented inmates and their awesome musical performances that give the movie its extraordinary power.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
