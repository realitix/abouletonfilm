Desperately trying to love and be loved. These cops, call girls, mafia hoods, transvestites, fortune-tellers, clowns, and freaks are all intertwined, heading on a crazy roller coaster ride into a black hole they think is life.  All of these characters are totally removed from the 60s America that, at the same time, is violently changing its values, fast. It is how hard they try, with the deck stacked against them, that we root for them in amazement. The film is done in funny hand drawn animation which makes their story even more amazing to watch. We invite you to enjoy the show.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iS7wWPFCuLWHZ8l3yCoO0lxxXfU.jpg", "actors": ["Omar Jones (Shorty)", "Robert Costanzo (Max)", "Tina Romanus (Molly)", "Rick Singer (Louie)", "Esperanza Quintero (Louise)", "Jess Gorell (Women)", "Joey Camen (Men)", "Ron Thompson (Cops)", "Jonathan Yudis (Godfather)", "Libby Aubrey ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
