Jin-geol, who through enchantment, has relations with Noh Ju-ma, soon regrets his actions and leaves Thailand. When Noh Ju-ma asks for help, the evil deity kills Jin-geol's wife Yi Hae who is pregnant with his baby. The evil deity soon turns into a monster and takes over Noh Ju-ma's body and starts killing people and tormenting Jin-geol. Noh Goh, who is aware of what has been going on bands together with the monk Chun Gong-myung to fight the evil deity. But their powers are no match for it at first until the spirits of Yi Hae and the unborn baby enter Noh Ju-ma's body and disunite Noh Ju-ma from the evil deity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/98zA7ixp45UltL4mlXhgTBmvd7F.jpg", "actors": ["Hyeon-jin Kim ()", "Myeong-gu Han ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
