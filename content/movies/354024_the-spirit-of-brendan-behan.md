Together it tells of Behan's life and also prison, about executions,about the fear that sometimes penetrates the soul and of the disgrace of day to day life in jail. Their Irish accents strengthen and empower the words during the unrolling of the 30 minute film immediately grabbing the harshness, force and cry of Behan's world. \"The Irish dislike those of their kind who think\", said Behan, who wrote a lot, lived a lot, and drank a lot.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
