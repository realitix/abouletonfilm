He was immediately removed from his family and home and transported under police escort over a thousand kilometres to be confined on an island for the treatment of the disease. For the next ten years, a leprosarium for Aboriginal people became his home. A lush tropical idyll off the north east coast of Australia, Fantome Island was the home to a close knit community of indigenous 'lepers' who made the most of their existence as people living on the fringes of the marginalised. Now as a 73 year old Joe reflects on his indelible Fantome years. His incredible, poignant story offers a profound insight into one of Australia's hidden histories.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zGJcAQiQSSuQHNqaG5pWU4RUH7G.jpg", "actors": ["Joe Eggmolesse (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "1iiikVKxtXc"}
