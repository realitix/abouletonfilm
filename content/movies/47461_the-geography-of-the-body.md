Off-screen, a voice recites fragments of oracular literature and purple prose. We see an eye, an ear, a mouth, a tongue, bits of hair, a hand, the tips of fingers, toes. Occasionally, the frame includes a larger scape of a body: a chest, a back, a breast. Usually the camera is stationery; sometimes, it moves across a body, remaining in close up. They hold hands for one moment. The bodies are without clothes; no genitalia are visible.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c1VqXQHZXOpOQGS3fz6LIoRXhpO.jpg", "actors": ["George Barker (Narrator / Body)", "Willard Maas (Body)", "Marie Menken (Body)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [83909, 350062, 350068, 39239], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
