Over the course of six months, their expedition traveled by icebreaker, canoe, and dog sled, capturing the Canadian fur trade in a silent feature documentary. The Romance of the Far Fur Country was released in 1920, two years before the legendary film Nanook of the North. Rediscovering the documentary in a British archive, another film crew begins a journey to resurrect the lost film, taking it to the communities where the film was originally shot. Images come to life; people recognize faces, landscapes, and lost traditions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vaij317lvbyWZq5UnjGOsr71DOw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
