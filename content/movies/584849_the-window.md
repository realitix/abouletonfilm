Rositza comes to pick up the kid, since she wants to take care of it. In the quarrel for the kid, get involved the proprietor of the attic Venera and her nephew Svetlozar. Soon everyone starts to unravel his or her own live experiences. The kid does not make a noise in the other room just to show that everyone has forgotten about him. No one from the characters has seen his or her faults. In order for them to avoid their vulnerability, they have a behavior style, which is not part of their human nature. They have lost their essence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fHpNGHlhwLfHdRI9ZuYMbILd07e.jpg", "actors": ["Leda Taseva (Venera)", "Antony Genov (Philip)", "Dobrinka Stankova (Rositza)", "Velko Kanev (Svetlozar)", "Plamena Getova (Marta)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
