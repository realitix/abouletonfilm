Maier, the Russell H. Seibert professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University discusses the production, canonization, and inspiration behind Scripture in this five-part Bible study from the LHM Men's Network.  As the Word of God, the Bible is a collection of rich and reliable texts - \"profitable,\" as the apostle paul says, \"for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness\" (I Timothy 3:16b).
