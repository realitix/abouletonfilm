In this wandering we follow the main character \u2013 a deadly girl with a violent and disturbed response to the emotional paranoia and alienation that the \u201cconcrete jungle\u201d can generate. The lumpen characters and the rest \u201cstrays of the streets\u201d that she runs into, the street art and the trash, become part of the set, composing a haunted picture of the modern \u201cghost town\u201d.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g0M4fSl95Ggyrc9b3ZUr4govvtu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
