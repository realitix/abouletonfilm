The incredible changes and reverses in European politics and culture exert a potent influence on one aristocratic Hungarian family. Losing virtually everything in the way of creature comforts, the family tries to keep up appearances. Eventually every member of the clan falls victim to illness, syphilis and their own headstrong foolishness. The parallels drawn by director Judith Elek between the dissipation of 19th century Hungarian aristocracy and the corruption of Communist ideology in modern times are inescapable.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/655TxkX5zUbcCvAWxkuotU4K1oY.jpg", "actors": ["Edit Handel (Szendrey J\u00falia)", "\u00c9va Ig\u00f3 (Szendrey Marika)", "S\u00e1ndor Szab\u00f3 (Szendrey Ign\u00e1c)", "Imre Csisz\u00e1r (Gyulai P\u00e1l)", "Tam\u00e1s Fodor (Horv\u00e1th \u00c1rp\u00e1d)", "Lajos Kov\u00e1cs (Pet\u00f5fi Istv\u00e1n)", "G\u00e1bor Svidrony (Kis\u00e1rp\u00e1d, J\u00falia fia)", "Gy\u00f6rgy R\u00e1cz (Attila, J\u00falia fia)", "Kati Bulcsu (J\u00falia l\u00e1nya)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
