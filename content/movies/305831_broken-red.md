Hans Croiset, Andr\u00e9 van den Heuvel, Bram van der Vlugt and Kitty Courbois in their roles of aged resistance heroes do not think this is such a bad idea; in fact, it is what they already did during World War II. Back then, they formed a sworn resistance gang. The occasion for their renewed fighting spirit is the brutal robbery and murder of Marjan, one of the members of their former group. Past and present start blending. In a controlled tempo, alert to detail and acting, a story unravels that focuses on Hans Croiset in the role of Simon, a retired teacher of Dutch. He makes contact with the underworld, meeting the Slavic Goran, who starts feeling sympathy for the old man. Eventually, fate lies in Simon's hands.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bDxjHlOGdSfNruvhVHTi0yCICYn.jpg", "actors": ["Dragan Bakema ()", "Nyncke Beekhuyzen ()", "Dai Carter ()", "Raoul Copier ()", "Raoul Copier ()", "Kitty Courbois ()", "Truus Dekker ()", "Hans Croiset ()", "David Goddyn ()", "Marlies Heuer ()", "Rein Hofman ()", "Sarah Jonker ()", "Dave Mantel ()", "Sylvia Poorta ()", "Betty Schuurman ()", "Bob Stoop ()", "Waldemar Torenstra ()", "Andr\u00e9 van den Heuvel ()", "Wim van der Grijn ()", "Pieter van der Sman ()", "Bram van der Vlugt ()", "Jeroen Willems ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
