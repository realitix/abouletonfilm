Like his previous instalment, Wild Jumbo, Beat \u201971 is an easy going youth drama that does not follow Yasuharu Hasebe\u2019s wild gang film path. Instead Fujita deals with social issues. The film follows a hippie community lead by Yoshitaro (Yoshio Harada). They decide to leave their trailer in Shinjuku and travel to countryside by bicycle to save their friend Furiko (Meiko Kaji) who has been falsely accused for murder. The real killer \u2013 although it was mainly self defense \u2013 is Furiko\u2019s boyfried Takaaki (Takeo Chii) who is being controlled by his politician father. Takaaki would rather live free as a hippie, but his father is forcing him to become a businessman.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2Tx5TsKbyhtzVnHxXe3npyOm9iz.jpg", "actors": ["Meiko Kaji (Furiko)", "Takeo Chii (Takaaki)", "Yoshio Inaba (Yoshitaro Araki)", "Yoshio Harada (Pirania)", "Tatsuya Fuji (Mappo)", "Bunjaku Han (Ayako)", "Michiko Tsukasa (Lemon)", "Nobuko Aoki (Shinko)", "Takashi Fujiki (Goebbels)", "Eiji G\u00f4 (S\u00f4t\u00f4)", "Torahiko Hamada (Narushima)", "Mari Koiso (Yume)", "Yuka Kumari (Aya)", "Soichiro Maeno (Himura)", "Y\u00fbsuke Natsu (Kappe)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
