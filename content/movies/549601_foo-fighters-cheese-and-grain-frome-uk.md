The band, arguably the biggest rock band in the world, played an intimate 2.5 hour set to an appreciative crowd of 650. Most of the audience had been selected from the bands fan mailing list in a 50 mile radius of Frome, but a lucky 100 that had assembled outside the venue were allowed in on the night, much to their surprise and delight!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8ZdFZVvl6pss3zmnq3G3AXzmOzF.jpg", "actors": ["Dave Grohl (Himself)", "Taylor Hawkins (Himself)", "Nate Mendel (Himself)", "Chris Shiflett (Himself)", "Pat Smear (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
