No one knows why Massimo has vowed to stop talking. Other than speaking dialog from classical plays, Massimo refuses to say a single word. His father, a classic-literature professor believes it reflects to a disappointing love affair. His new girlfriend thinks Massimo is rebelling against his mother, a poet. A director learns of Massimo and commissions his mother to write a play about him. Though Massimo plays himself in the play, and does speak, he returns to silence when the play is finished.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w8sL0frPDqTLAGIZT7B19hhoMr.jpg", "actors": ["Thierry Blanc ()", "Simona Cavallari ()", "Nathalie Boutefeu ()", "Roberto Herlitzka ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
