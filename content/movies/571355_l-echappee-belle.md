It's true that Manu Barnes is free-spirited and for much of his twelve year marriage to Mathilde that he has been too centered on his career, but he does love his kids and believes he should see them more often than one weekend a month. The judge called him irresponsible and he decides to disprove her words by kidnapping Chloe, the judge's strong-willed adolescent daughter. He takes the girl to a remote, snow-bound mountain cabin. Unfortunately, she thinks Manu is sexually attracted to her. A disaster nearly occurs there, but Chloe manages to get back to Paris. Though he knows a private detective is trailing him, the determined Manu decides to abduct his kids and take them out of the country.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vJPBwn2kAT99MON8qLK1gyIzNZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
