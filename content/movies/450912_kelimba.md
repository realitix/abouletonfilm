That is particularly true when he concerns himself with filmic space. In Kelimba moving plastic objects are inserted, one after another, in a completely flat picture space. At the same time the processes of movement are subjected to a repetitive rhythm and thus transformed into a dance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zEXJHaTzcoVmX51cRJLOJYYrH40.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
