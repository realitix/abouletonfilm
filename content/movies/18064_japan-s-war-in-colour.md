It recounts the history of the Second World War from a Japanese perspective, combining original colour film with letters and diaries written by Japanese people. It tells the story of a nation at war from the diverse perspectives of those who lived through it: the leaders and the ordinary people, the oppressors and the victims, the guilty and the innocent.  Until recently, it was believed that no colour film of Japan existed prior to 1945. But specialist research has now unearthed a remarkable colour record from as early as the 1930s.  For eight years the Japanese fought what they believed was a Holy War that became a fight to the death. Japan's War In Colour shows how militarism took hold of the Japanese people; describes why Japan felt compelled to attack the West; explains what drove the Japanese to resist the Allies for so long; and, finally, reveals how they dealt with the shame of defeat.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lhQKhomgT2Pjuay2AmcK1OIzMzF.jpg", "actors": ["Brian Cox (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
