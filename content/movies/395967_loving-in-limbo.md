Hap Cameron (a published author originally from Nelson) had a dream of working in every continent, which catapulted him into a lifetime of adventure, danger and love. He spent close to a decade fulfilling his ambition \u2014 cycling through Africa, sailing to Antarctica, teaching scuba diving in Asia and working in an orphanage in Guatemala. But Hap discovered the greatest adventure of all was meeting the woman of his dreams and the extraordinary obstacles he had to overcome to be with her. Mandy Todd, an American high school teacher, was on holiday in Mexico when she met Hap. They spent only six days together before they knew this was more than a holiday romance. What took place over the next seven years tested their love further than most couples could sustain.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
