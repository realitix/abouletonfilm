The team keeps losing and Coach Cooper is about to lose his job as his efforts to win the last game of the season, against the team's Big Rival, end in disaster. But, unknown to he and his wife, Elizabeth, Connie has sold an article, called \"I Was a Bubble Dancer\" to a 'True-Confession\" magazine, and the girl-who-couldn't-get-a-date becomes suddenly popular and, because of her, the high-school football star from another town decides to play his college-ball for Coach Cooper. Jessup is forced to keep Cooper on as the school's football coach.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v7w8hcBO6vG8DtPjX5KrfrFrcrR.jpg", "actors": ["Fred MacMurray (George Cooper)", "Maureen O'Hara (Elizabeth Cooper)", "Betty Lynn (Connie Cooper)", "Natalie Wood (Ellen Cooper)", "Rudy Vallee (Mr. Jessup)", "Thelma Ritter (Geraldine)", "Jim Backus (Professor Sullivan)", "Richard Tyler (Joe Birch)", "Buddy Martin (Cheerleader)", "Frank Mills (Assistant Football Coach)", "Mickey McCardle (Jones)", "Louise Lorimer (Mrs. Jones)", "Ruth Clifford (Neighbor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
