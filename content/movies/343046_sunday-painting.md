She is in love with a married man. She pretends that she never waits for him, and if he suddenly turns up she acts as if she is surprised. In reality the unresolved relationship is making her so depressed that her work is the only thing that is saving her. In an attempt to break her addiction she enters into a relationship with another man. But the balance she is looking for eludes her, as now she has to choose between the two. But Eva can't: she wants to have an entire life, not part of one. In the form of a sort of filmic diary, Eva now attempts to sort out the puzzle, which is her life.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Alf Brustellin (Alf)", "Bernhard Sinkel (Bernd)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
