Under divine circumstances, they are given their wish. Dimension follows the tragic tale of Chance Pullman, and the way in which his own troubled past comes to affect and change the lives of those who come into contact with him. A reminder of how the littlest things often have the biggest consequences, Chance provides strangers and close friends with the opportunity to completely alter their life, but with one limitation: They can only change exactly three inches about themselves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x46dCzxjsuJI2DUW9rKZZbp6qr5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
