The Cat (Adam Cheng) and Pai Yu-tang a.k.a. The Rat (Alexander Fu Sheng) compete in various flamboyantly choreographed duels before realizing that they must seek the judgment of their master (Lau Kar-wing). He disappoints them by ruling that their abilities are perfectly equal, then being so completely impartial as to give the Rat a nine-ringed sword which he can use to defeat the Cat, and giving the Cat a spear to defeat the sword which he just gave the Rat. A few more contests result in ties before a subplot gets underway involving a precious jade seal owned by the Emperor Yung Hsi (Gordon Lau) and the thieves out to steal it. This, finally, is what forces the Cat and Rat to work together and overcome their rivalry.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h1LfqlN3xRDQOA40V6EJ3Egsndr.jpg", "actors": ["Adam Cheng (Jien Chiu (Royal Cat))", "Alexander Fu Sheng (Bai Yu Tong, Rat)", "Hsiao Ho (Cheung Ping, Water Rat)", "Kara Hui (Jien Yu Lan)", "Lau Kar-Wing (Master Si Da Fu)", "Gordon Liu Chia-Hui (Emperor Yang Xi)", "Wong Ching-Ho (Minister Huang)", "Lydia Shum (Bai's mother)", "Johnny Wang Lung-Wei (Pierce Mountain Rat)", "King Lee King-Chu (Ground Rat)", "Cheung Chin-Pang (Sky Rat)", "Lung Tien-Hsiang (Shui Sheung Piu)", "Lam Fai-Wong (Chan Jien)", "Wilson Tong (Thief)", "Siao Yuk (Emperor's bodyguard)", "Sek Gong (Emperor's bodyguard)", "Wan Seung-Lam (Tong's servant)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "RDCYjp9WDZg"}
