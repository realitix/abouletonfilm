May-Who is also one of the \u201cInvisibles\u201d and has an extraordinary secret: an ability to discharge electricity like a Tesla coil. Whenever her heart beats faster than 120 beats per minute her body releases a powerful electricity charge. Pong accidentally learns about this and promises to keep it a secret in exchange for helping each other win over their own high-school crushes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eeIZsAt4BarwCj6sONybay8Iw72.jpg", "actors": ["Sutatta Udomsilp (May Nai)", "Thiti Mahayotaruk (Pong)", "Thanapob Leeratanakajorn (Fame)", "Kanyawee Songmuang (May (Cheerleader))", "Narikun Ketprapakorn (Mink)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [104651, 408574, 407936, 184219], "youtube_key": "BWmHi_1yaPE"}
