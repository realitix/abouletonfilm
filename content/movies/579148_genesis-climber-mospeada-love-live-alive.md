The music video consisted of both old and new footage. The story of Love Live Alive chronicled the events after the ending of the original Mospeada, featuring Yellow Belmont as the main character. The music video focused on Yellow's concert and also on his flashback of past events.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xE5nT9nwVM5Ko3vagh5YfsIlPb.jpg", "actors": ["Mika Doi ()", "Waka Kanda ()", "Mine Matsuki ()", "Sanae Miyuki ()", "Tomomichi Nishimura ()", "Bin Shimada ()", "Hirotaka Suzuoki ()", "Miki Takahashi ()", "Hisao Oyama ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
