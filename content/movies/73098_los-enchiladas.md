The 2 folks in \"management\" are both into their own authority and fill their days creating wild &amp; stupid rules for the working folk. By mid-film, however, the manager has fled the cops after beating the crap out of a competing restaurant's dancing gyro... and the \"Chef\" has jumped ship to join a beatnik poet's groups which specializes in exotic menu-writing. This leaves the minimum-wage crowd to run the place as they see fit.... and they see a lot of debauchery, booze, and free steak in their future.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2mY67mEOX17b514EYv9gIOkgh0s.jpg", "actors": ["Mitch Hedberg (Lee)", "Dave Attell (Don)", "Todd Barry (Duane)", "Gregory Arata (Robbie)", "Marc Maron (Devin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
