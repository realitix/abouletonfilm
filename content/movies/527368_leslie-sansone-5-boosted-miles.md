It\u2019s EASY and FUN! We recommend that you start with the Bonus SESSION.  This is where Leslie shows you the Top 10 Walk Moves and teaches you how to BOOST each one. After that, you can dive right into the 5 miles\u2014in any way that you like. You can walk a gentle mile and then a boosted mile. You can walk two miles without boosting anything and then boost the next two. Or you can even opt to boost only some of the moves within each mile.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b5pnljXy1eAqNBzdoNT8l7Ktcq7.jpg", "actors": ["Leslie Sansone (Video Lead)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
