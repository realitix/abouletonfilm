In their late twenties and tired of partying their way around the world, Danish Marie and Irish Sophie come ashore in Northern Scotland. After another drunken night they are soon parted from all their accumulated cash. Out of money and out of luck ambitious Sophie pressures Marie into accepting a lucrative job as surrogate mother. Months on, Marie finds herself alone, life having taken a dramatic turn. Heavily pregnant, and wanting to terminate her pregnancy, she's on the run from the future parents, searching for Sophie's old flame, Ken. In a case of mistaken identity, Marie ends up in hiding with three strange men in a seedy Glasgow garage. But then happiness strikes again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sTYDyKZLV5DQA6sCWvYhye2tYzP.jpg", "actors": ["Iben Hjejle (Marie)", "Bronagh Gallagher (Sophie)", "Martin Henderson (Ian / Ken)", "Ewen Bremner (Gabriel)", "Gary Lewis (Willy)", "Simon McBurney (Thomas)", "Helen Baxendale (Stella)", "James Cosmo (Robert)", "Scott Handy (Roman)", "Tam Dean Burn (Dr. Meisling)", "Kay Gallie (Housekeeper)", "Bill Gardiner ()", "Rory Cullin ()", "Eric Joseph ()", "George McNeilage ()", "Russell Hunter ()", "Andrew Dallmeyer ()", "Michael Daly ()", "Jack Murray ()", "Stan Reilly ()", "Alexander Allen ()", "George Carson ()", "Maxwell Kay ()", "Phyllis Kilty ()", "Alison Peebles ()", "Chick Allan ()", "G\u00f6ran Parkrud ()", "Peter Andersson ()", "Ludvig Svensson ()", "Nathalie Olofsson ()", "Olivia Luzzana ()", "Julian Lind S\u00f8rensen ()", "Julia Hultgren ()", "Victor Hultgren ()", "Zack Lundkvist ()", "Kathrin Hermasson ()", "William Uffelmann ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
