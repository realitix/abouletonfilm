Due to his progressive ideas, he is transferred to a small town. The village environment is even more depressing than his former surroundings were, as the influence of both the secular and the Church authorities is even greater in the country. Even though Martin meets Ton\u010dka and the two of them get married, he gradually becomes a disillusioned and embittered man. In time, when society's strictures become somewhat milder, Martin is transferred to a more friendly environment, but all the injustices he has experienced have already bitten too deep. Unlike his wife, Martin finds it very difficult to accept changes. When his son dies, it seems as though he has lost all his elan and the will to live. Will he be able to go on bringing the light of knowledge to the ignorant masses, or will his ideals be buried forever like a man in a snowdrift?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dfdSk1gDWpfZ0zJTnU1yOgX8OuD.jpg", "actors": ["Radko Poli\u010d (Martin Ka\u010dur)", "Milena Zupan\u010di\u010d (Ton\u010dka)", "Dare Ulaga (Ferjan)", "Stevo \u017digon (Priest from Zapolje)", "Arnold Tovornik (Priest from Blatni Dol)", "Bert Sotlar (Mayor from Blatni Dol)", "Janez Albreht (Graj\u017ear)", "Marjeta Gregora\u010d (Minka)", "Janez Bermez ()", "Maks Bajc ()", "Marija Benko ()", "Janez Roha\u010dek (Teacher from Zapolje)", "Toma\u017e Pipan ()", "Lojze Sadar ()", "Mila Kacic ()", "Aleksander Kro\u0161l ()", "Boris Kralj ()", "Dare Vali\u010d ()", "Maks Furijan ()", "Tone Kuntner ()", "Vinko Podgor\u0161ek ()", "Janez Er\u017een ()", "France Severkar ()", "Jure Kav\u0161ek ()", "Vladimir Jurc ()", "Zvone Agre\u017e ()", "Maja Boh ()", "Ru\u0161a Bojc ()", "Francek Drofenik ()", "Stanislava Bonisegna ()", "Jozko Luke\u0161 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
