His wife refuses to speak with him, and his daughter, who changes her career more often than her clothes, has begun dating a man old enough to be Leonard's father! On top of it all, the government has asked him to come back and save the world again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aauZlMqKIDxTlgRZgZlRrJJ9JU2.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Cosby (Leonard Parker)", "Tom Courtenay (Frayn)", "Joe Don Baker (Nick Snyderburn)", "Moses Gunn (Giorgio Francozzi)", "Pat Colbert (Allison Parker)", "Gloria Foster (Medusa Johnson)", "Victoria Rowell (Joan Parker)", "Grace Zabriskie (Jefferson)", "Anna Levine (Nurse Carvalho)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "reverenddr", "content": "Leonard Part 6 is without a doubt bizarre and stupid.\r\n\r\nBill Cosby plays a former spy turned millionaire turned vigilante who must save the world from an insane vegetarian who controls the minds of animals with murderous intent. Cosby drives a Porsche 928 with a tank turrent mounted on top and fights vegetarian henchmen with magical sparkling hot dogs.\r\n\r\nCosby himself said the movie was a mistake. Nevertheless it's a crazy spectacle of a film, and everyone who calls themselves a movie buff should see it once.\r\n\r\nI saw this movie upon its release (when I was 7 years old) and loved it. Because of the fond memories and pure insanity I rate it a 6/10."}], "recommandations_id": [3592, 28159, 23943, 10696], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
