Now, its buildings stand derelict and empty; half have already been demolished by investors with new plans. The symphony of mechanical sounds and gestures that is gradually built up throughout the film is produced by former factory employees. Proud of their factory, they reminisce about the huge numbers of people and the parties they had. They were a community, passionate about supporting agriculture through their factory. The Ursus tractor was well-known, not only in Poland but throughout the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sIrO0tULFxgxhqUIcKcKSNj013Z.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
