Act 1 \u2013 Cutting liver, Act II \u2013 Ironing, Act III \u2013 Plucking Eyebrows. Three potentially violent domestic activities performed by a woman. Jayne Parker discovered film as a medium when she was a sculpture student at Canterbury College of Art (1977-80). In early works, objects, performance and gesture were combined by the camera to explore space, duration and the physical body. The images in these early films were both literal and metaphoric, depicting exact events but also creating physical and personal associations for the viewer. Ideas are evoked in images rather than words; ordinary actions are also enigmas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dZHDVcHL7YWgUWq5bnDKbxR3biy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
