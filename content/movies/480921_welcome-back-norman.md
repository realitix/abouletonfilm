Returning home from a business trip, a visibly weary Norman must negotiate the baggage check and an airport parking lot.  Mundane tasks for most, but for Norman a blank canvas soon to be smeared with failure.  This time Norman does rate his own theme song, in the form of a bored singer-songwriter droning out the humdrum details of Norman's life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v9nrOJw9LG1fUBvqDMLGNcv9pNY.jpg", "actors": ["Douglas P.
