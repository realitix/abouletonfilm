TV directors Anja Stabell and Stein-Roger Bull reinforces the impact by letting bloods bright color compete against black and white images. Poppea like youve never seen it before!  At the centre of events is the power-crazed Poppea. She aspires to the top level of the hierarchy and seduces Emperor Nero. He is totally captivated by Poppea and does everything possible to marry her, even if it leads to murder. A classic drama unfolds, where the struggle for power and riches paints an unattractive portrait of humankind. In this respect not much has changed since the opera was written 365 years ago.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tlPexB1ykCFTrjHWkMF3X7lqr2F.jpg", "actors": ["Birgitte Christensen ()", "Jacek Laszczkowski ()", "Tim Mead ()", "Marita S\u00f8lberg ()", "Patricia Bardon ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
