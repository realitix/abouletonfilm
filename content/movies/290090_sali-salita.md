The restless child finds a chance to create his own stories when his grandfather, comes up with a game. They fill an old milk can with pieces of paper, each containing a word which will be a \u201cstory-starter\u201d. Tales of heroes and villains, magic and places fill up the child\u2019s imagination. But the child\u2019s made-up story is in need of a happy ending. Now, it depends on the storyteller mother to create the greatest ending of them all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vOv59MkaYiRzbApfSIL0pCMkmU4.jpg", "actors": ["Migs Cuaderno (Josh)", "Judy Chua (Helen)", "Bodjie Pascua (Lolo)", "Carme Sanchez (Aling Nelly)", "Alvin Aguilar (Warrior)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
