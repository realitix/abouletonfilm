The man behind that character was Sean Morley and the year 1999 would see a high point for Val...as he won the intercontinental title.  But celebration would be short lived as parents' group trained their crosshairs on the risque product and the 'Right to Censor' angle was born. The porn star was gone, and the new clothes just didn't fit Morley or his aspirations. We go back to another year in the TIMELINE!!!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4Vrdef0MQGsUx4VwKI8Dm4PO36r.jpg", "actors": ["Sean Allen Morley (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
