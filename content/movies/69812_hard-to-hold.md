Tristan is the main attraction at SF's famed Nob Hill Theatre, struttin' his stuff, teasing and titillating his eager audience with his smooth moves. The unholy trinity of studs (Sebastian Gronoff, Addison Scott, and Marcus Iron) heat up the private backroom with all the hot and steamy mansex they generate.
