They were seen as Gods by primitive man and worshipped. They set themselves apart. Some mated with humans and created a special race. When the beings departed, a hybrid species remained and taught mankind. The human race, which had existed for tens of thousands of years as hunters and gatherers, now had systematic knowledge on a startling level. They control our hearts and minds; they control this world; they control every individual from the depths of outer space. From the moment you are born, you are numbered and moved through a process to feed their machine. Nobody is truly free. We are all working for the masters. On rare occasions, they are revealed to the world and in the 18th century we had a glimpse of their massive power. We know them as the Illuminati. From huge international corporations, to hidden governments, from secret societies to medicine, the Illuminati are in control.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/33H4BDpiiJsNCKybitpgcxcX6Tf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
