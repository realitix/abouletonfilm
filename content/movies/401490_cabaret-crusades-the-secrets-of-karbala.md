Inspired by the writings of Lebanese writer Amin Maalouf, Shawky\u2019s film trilogy explores the horrors of the medieval holy wars in the Middle-East \u2013 from an Arab perspective. With a cast made up entirely of puppets, the third part, The Secrets of Karbala (2014), centres on the period between the 7th and 12th centuries, covering the crusades as well as a dispute between two Islamic sects. Beautifully made of handblown Murano glass, the puppets have amazing expressive power, making the scenes full of violence, repression and torture all the more awe-inspiring.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iiA2cEBlVv0jPcu8apkj53KxBMM.jpg", "actors": ["Aida Fahmy ()", "Aida Fahmy ((voice))", "Mahmoud Masaoud ((voice))", "Khaled al-Zahaby ((voice))", "Adel Khalaf ((voice))", "Amed Khalil ((voice))", "Tarek Ismail ((voice))", "Jehad Abo al-Enein ((voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
