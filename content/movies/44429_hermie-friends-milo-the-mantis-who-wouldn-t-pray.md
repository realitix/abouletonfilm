Milo thinks he has to get God's attention in order for God to hear him. Milo finally learns to pray and realizes that God has been helping him all along. Then ironically sees that all the things he was using to get God's attention are the very things he needs to rebuild his Snack Shack. The garden learns an important lesson about how to trust God after we pray and that God's answers come in many different forms.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8CjxlAkLUgE649zeEzYsYaIDiIO.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Kind (Milo)", "Tim Conway (Hermie)", "Melissa Disney (Hailey & Bailey)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
