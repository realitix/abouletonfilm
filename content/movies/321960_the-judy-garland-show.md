Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin indulge in their usual Rat Pack high jinks, swilling drinks, trading barbs and crooning catchy tunes. But it's Judy Garland in the spotlight here, the crown jewel among gems, belting out classics such as \"The Man That Got Away,\" \"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\" and more.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pwYeT7MqvUlwzBvjT2sYeez4h0j.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
