Jean-Louis Vattier dreams about his lovely downstairs neighbor, Brigitte Lahaie, although his dreams occasionally turn into nightmares involving his hard hat co-worker Dominique Aveline. One particularly strange and violent sequence is not made any more watchable by some slow motion fighting accompanied by the usual \u2018arousing\u2019 sax music instead of more threatening music, but this entire film is one big incomprehensible trip anyway, so the viewer had better prepare for more far out scenes. Pierre awakes to find his beautiful blond wife (although she\u2019s no Brigitte) played by Ursula White. Obviously their marriage is in trouble, with him living in a fantasy world of his own making while she, Janine, has taken a lover of the same sex (Liliane Lemieuvre as Rosette). Pierre spots Brigitte in a book store and begins to fantasize once more.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yl3ESJbNxEikdWrRcHpkNck1d63.jpg", "actors": ["Brigitte Lahaie (Marianne)", "Ursula White (Janine)", "Jean-Louis Vattier (Pierre)", "Dominique Aveline ()", "Richard Allan (Party Guest)", "Charlie Schreiner (Party Guest)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
