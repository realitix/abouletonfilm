The fact is that symptoms of depression or anxiety can influence how you think, feel, act and communicate. Other family members (particularly children) can be confused with what they see and hear. In the case of young people, they may not understand what\u2019s happening, and may make up their own reasons for your behaviour.  Talking about mental illness as a family can help everyone make sense of what\u2019s going on. In fact, research has proven that open family discussion bolsters family strength and also build a child's resilience to developing mental health problems of their own.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rfzcVDpBFeoCWRgrGh4gZ27zwYp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
