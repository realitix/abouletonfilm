Kazuo decides to film her. He narrates his visits to her there: first while her flatmate is Sugako, a woman Miyuki is attracted to; then, while she works at a bar and is with Paul, an African-American soldier. Once, Kazuo brings his girlfriend, Sachiko. We see Miyuki with her son, with other bar girls, and with Sachiko. Miyuki, pregnant, returns to Tokyo and delivers a mixed-race child on her own with Kazuo and Sachiko filming. She joins a women's commune, talks about possibilities, enjoys motherhood, and is uninterested in a traditional family. Does the filmmaker have a point of view?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/83nzXOnsyYJxMJiiRj1NmLvtl69.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [123094, 79860, 88529, 72489], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
