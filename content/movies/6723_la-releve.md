What immediately comes to mind? The five Dirty Harry films, right? Or \u201cThe Gauntlet\u201d (1977)? All great or near-great Eastwood cop pictures. So you'd expect the same from 1990's \u201cThe Rookie,\u201d costarring Charlie Sheen as the sidekick. Well, you'd be wrong.\r\n\r\nSomething keeps \u201cThe Rookie\u201d from attaining the heights of those other Eastwood cop films. It even pales compared to \u201cTightrope\u201d (1984) and \u201cBlood Work\u201d (2002). Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are some entertaining elements and the thrills certainly pick up in the overblown last act, but the flick\u2019s too contrived and even falls into camp territory at times.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Sheen\u2019s unconvincing as a tough cop who can singlehandedly take down a bar on the wrong side of town, not to mention the miscasting of Latino\u2019s Raul Julia and Sonia Braga as German villains. While Braga is stunning, she\u2019s not utilized to her potential; neither is Lara Flynn Boyle. Meanwhile Tom Skerritt is wasted in a trivial role as Sheen's rich dad.\r\n\r\nSo this is a disappointing, even laughable Eastwood cop flick and rightly forgotten. The constant macho f-bombs don't help. Still, there are enough engaging moments to make it worth catching if you can laugh with it.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 2 hours and was shot in the Los Angeles area.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C/C-"}], "recommandations_id": [10651, 15417, 10650, 17689], "youtube_key": "m_lF4QJAM0w"}
