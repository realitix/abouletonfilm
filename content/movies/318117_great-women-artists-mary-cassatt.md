Despite her family's objections to her goal of being a professional artist, Cassatt pursued her passion. Her earlier works reflected the influence of her Impressionist colleagues Caillebotte, Degas, and Renoir -- but her later, bolder canvases depict a world of her own creation.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
