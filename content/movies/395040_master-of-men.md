Buck owns a prosperous steel mill and they make a very good living, but he is ambitious and wants more. To this end, he is devoting considerable amounts of time to expanding his finances -- and doing quite well. Not satisfied with his success, he journeys to New York, where his wrangling further increases his bank account. Unfortunately, his stock with his wife is dropping steadily. Jealous and unhappy, she fights back by giving one of Buck's business rivals details about what he is up to.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5oPj3ayNYoHaaxz7TBFZ9b7ktWM.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Holt (Buck Garrett)", "Fay Wray (Kay Walling)", "Walter Connolly (Sam Parker)", "Berton Churchill (Mr. Walling)", "Theodore von Eltz (Grenaker)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
