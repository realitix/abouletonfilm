Why did she choose these three pieces, in essence so different, but which intimately resonate with her: Berio\u2019s Sequenza III, Berg\u2019s Lulu Suite, and Gershwin\u2019s Girl Crazy? With this musical voyage peering into a world of precision and sharing, where a passionate woman brings forth a vocal tour de force, Mathieu Amalric, C\u00e9sar winner for Best Actor in 2005 and 2008, shows us once more his talent behind the camera with this new opus that goes beyond a mere artist\u2019s portrait.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Barbara Hannigan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
