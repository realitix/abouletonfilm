Such considerations are, of course, of only superficial importance: once producer and songwriter Jim Steinman had patented the Meat Loaf template on 1977's 30-million-selling Bat Out of Hell--an engagingly preposterous synthesis of Springsteen's Born to Run, Spector's Be My Baby, Wagner's \"Ride of the Valkyries\",.  On the DVD: This DVD offers a choice of Dolby Surround Sound or PCM Stereo, and has a refreshingly simple and easy to navigate menu offering instant access to different tracks. The special features are desultory in the extreme: a brief biography of the Meat Loaf phenomenon and a discography.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9ZlpAG8Ezqcd1wCgFIZFVIKVMYy.jpg", "actors": ["Meat Loaf (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
