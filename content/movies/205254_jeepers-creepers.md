Before he arrives, we tour the house and hear some evil-sounding cackles, which, it turns out, are coming from a radio one that a ghost was listening to. The ghost then sings the title song while getting ready for a night of haunting, just as Porky arrives. The ghost invites him in with a woman's voice, then disappears. Porky comes in and gets spooked by some flapping curtains. When he comes back in, the ghost puts a couple frogs into a pair of shoes and sets them loose; they collect a hatrack and a curtain, forming a sort of black ghost that ultimately scares Porky upstairs right into the arms of the ghost.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zDt2J5wQPTCWbbqTj0H6p1Zyaps.jpg", "actors": ["Mel Blanc ()", "Pinto Colvig ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [161885, 86731, 87234], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
