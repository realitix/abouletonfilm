The first disc offers the singer/songwriter's CBS special as it originally aired (of course without commercial interruptions). The second disc offers a wealth of footage that was recorded between songs, and features performances cut out of the original broadcast. Barry Manilow himself offers a commentary track on this extended version of the concert. The sound has been recorded in Dolby Digital 5.1. Supplemental materials include lyrics to the songs, a biography of the artist, a Manilow discography, and a still photo gallery. This is a fabulous release for any fan of Manilow's distinctive sound.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ioqCwH7l7Qi6nBFfOt0QHoiLl3a.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
