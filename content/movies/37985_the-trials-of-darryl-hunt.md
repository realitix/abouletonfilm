Both a social justice story and a personally driven narrative, the film chronicles this capital case from 1984 through 2004. With exclusive footage from two decades, the film frames the judicial and emotional response to a chilling crime - and the implications that reverberate from Hunt's conviction - against a backdrop of class and racial bias in the South and in the American criminal justice system.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xCzLoQaNWuFViAtcWY5BR5I5OzC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [173192, 43734, 159005, 29044], "youtube_key": "16miEJ-tKjM"}
