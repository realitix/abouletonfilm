Between 1949 and 1991 the Soviet Union detonated 116 above ground bombs, whose massive radioactive mushroom clouds were witnessed by thousands of innocent and unsuspecting Kazakh villagers.  They gazed openmouthed at the spectacle, completely unaware that nuclear fallout was raining down on them, their children, livestock and homes.  20 years after the closure of The Polygon they are still suffering high rates of cancer, cancer related diseases and mental illness. The Polygon takes us on a journey from the twisted Cold War experiments to those victims who remain today, still suffering despite the emergence of Kazakhstan as a major economic player on the global stage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rM5KaJx9n2qn1dYpjQERLBBuSDD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
