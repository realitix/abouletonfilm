Chris Martin, Will Champion, Guy Berryman, and Jon Buckland debuted new tunes (\"Square One,\" \"Fix You\"), revisited old favorites (\"Clocks,\" \"Yellow\") and even shared a song they wrote for Johnny Cash (\"Till Kingdom Come\"). Chris explained that \"Yellow\" was inspired by the Yellow Pages (\"In an alternative universe this song would be called Playboy\") and revealed \"Speed Of Sound\" was an attempt to rip-off Kate Bush's \"Running Up That Hill.\" It was a magical night for the introspective Britpop heavyweights.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wvBR8yqHHdeRoRde9m1SLTzkr31.jpg", "actors": ["Coldplay (Themselves)", "Guy Berryman (Himself)", "Jon Buckland (Himself)", "Will Champion (Himself)", "Chris Martin (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
