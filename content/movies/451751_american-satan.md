But I still really enjoyed _American Satan_. If I try to keep it professional, it is really easy to find holes to poke in the quality of _American Satan_, but that doesn't stop it from having really spoken to me on a level somehow simultaneously both shallow and personal. _American Satan_ will probably not resonate with the majority of audiences, and objectively, it's not a great film, but I think (and hope) it will find some sort of a place in cult cinema.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"}], "recommandations_id": [304816, 529982, 500203, 399896], "youtube_key": "AX35prUFlBk"}
