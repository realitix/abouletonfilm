The Tivoli is about to be demolished by the corrupt major of Mexico city, and the artists struggle to try to save their workplace. Throughout the movie we see a strong critique towards the Mexican political system of the time, where corrupt politicians run everything like a fiefdom, and live with double standards. While they publicly criticize the Tivoli as obscene and indecent, many of them are regular customers and they even \"hire\" the artists to do private functions in their mansions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jy8s4EHP3QkyfsUZzdX6PCQoi0P.jpg", "actors": ["Alfonso Ar\u00e1u (Tiliches)", "Pancho C\u00f3rdova (Quijanito)", "Lyn May (Eva Candela)", "Carmen Salinas (Chapas)", "Mario Garc\u00eda 'Harapos' (Harapos)", "Ernesto G\u00f3mez Cruz (engineer Reginaldo)", "Gina Morett (Mim\u00ed Manila)", "Carolina Barret (Mrs. Quijanito)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
