While it's true that Marihuana leans towards stridency and unsubtlety, it has a lot more going for than, say, Reefer Madness. Lopez Lagar plays a prominent surgeon whose pot-addict wife is murdered under sordid circumstances. Vowing revenge, the doctor ventures into Buenos Aires' drug subculture to find his wife's killer. He finds a few faithful friends along the way, notably a singer (Fanny Navarro) and a pianist (Nathan Pinzon). Unfortunately, the surgeon becomes the very thing he despises when he takes to the weed himself. The climax pits the good guys against the evil forces of a drug-dealer (Eduardo Cuitino) and his gang. Some intentional humor is provided by Hector Quintanilla as a goofy doper.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wNHcJFWGxtlpd8yWh86xCASAbqd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
