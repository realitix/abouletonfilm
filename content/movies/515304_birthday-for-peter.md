After breakfast he goes off to school, with his toy locomotive, but fails to return at 4 o'clock. While she searches around the neighbourhood, Dad arrives home to an empty house. We see Peter in the grip of a sinister man and struggling to get away. His parents keep searching and finally call the police but it doesn't look good. Suddenly, we see Mum wake up and dash into Peter's room. He's quite safe.
