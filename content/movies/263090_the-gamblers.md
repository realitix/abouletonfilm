His comfortable fantasy of future solvency has been sorely tried; to restore it, he begins to try wooing his cousin Kathrin (the woman with the loot). However, as things progress, he finds himself actually falling for her, which is perhaps the only really decent thing that he's done in his adult life. When he and a gambling buddy take Kathrin (Anica Dobra) on a jaunt to the south of France, things get pretty dicey when a corrupt cop comes onto the scene. In this romantic thriller, only one will survive.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iQQ0eS6md81q0Xpxa3jw4UcWyj6.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Lohmeyer (Jojo)", "Adele Neuhauser (Anette)", "Jochen Nickel (Taxifahrer)", "Anica Dobra (Kathrin)", "Hansa Czypionka (Tom)", "Volker Eckstein (Anwalt)", "Joachim Kemmer (Strobeck)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
