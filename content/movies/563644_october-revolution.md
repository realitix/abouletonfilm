Stock footage from both World Wars are included with 30 minutes of new scenes filmed especially for the project. The historical timeline is traced from the time Czar Nicholas II is crowned. The emergence of Lenin, his death in 1924, and the later contributions of Trotsky and Stalin give the viewer a sense of death, betrayal, and ideological devotion to the communist agenda. Rossif effectively uses scenes from the landmark 1929 film The Man With A Movie Camera by celebrated director Dziga Vertov. Rossif researched the film archives from several countries in his meticulous gathering of materials for this timely historical feature.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mNSoqwfwijqati194FNlr9h9SHc.jpg", "actors": ["John Gielgud ()", "Suzanne Flon ()", "Pierre Vaneck ()", "Andr\u00e9 Reybaz ()", "Jean-Pierre Cassel ()", "Peggy Ashcroft ()", "Robert Rietti ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
