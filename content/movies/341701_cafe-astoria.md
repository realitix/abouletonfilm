The story relates with a gentle melancholy and a slight irony the lives of  a middle-class family: the cafe owner, his wife and their son. Through their individual destinies we become acquainted with the social and historical background of a by-gone era; the social and national differences of pre-war Maribor, divisions among the wealthy and poor, and nationally minded Slovenes  and fanatic Germanophils. The first year after the war  introduced  the absurd characteristic cruel measures of the so-called revolutionary social transformations  in which calamity and coincidence intervene, resulting in events of  comic nature, of course, as seen from a safe distance of fifty years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s6GNZGf4ZhTsYGYfhhoq252WH5k.jpg", "actors": ["Janez Ho\u010devar (O\u010da)", "Lidija Kozlovi\u010d (Mati)", "Branko \u0160turbej (Branko)", "Igor Jalu\u0161i\u010d (Branko kot fant)", "Nata\u0161a Ti\u010d Ralijan (Janja)", "Ludvik Bagari (Kugla)", "Branko Dobrnik (Kugla kot fant)", "Ale\u0161 Vali\u010d (Tone)", "Vlado Novak (Rudi)", "Roman Kon\u010dar (Ivan)", "Vladimir Jurc (Mudri \u010dlovek)", "Anton Petje (Wagner)", "Isabela Albrecht (Frau Wagner)", "Brane Gruber (Provokator)", "Ivo Ban (Baumann)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
