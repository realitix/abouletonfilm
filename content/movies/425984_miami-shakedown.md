He refuses to pay his tab of a million dollars to the criminal casino. He is soon shocked to discover Vivian, his bratty, tennis-playing teen daughter has been kidnapped by a smooth-of-skill but slight-of-bod professional, criminal-for-hire Caroline Horner. Alfred suddenly realizes how much his neglected daughter now means to him and makes a typically shrewd decision attesting to his ability to amass millions, and readily agrees to fork over an amount five times his original debt.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Philip Michael Thomas (Frank Ferguson)", "Anabel Garcia (Caroline Horner)", "Steve Roth (Alfred Stein)", "Loli Rainey (Vivian Stein (the daughter))", "Therese Marie (Vivi Stein)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
