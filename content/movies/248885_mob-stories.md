For the first time on television, Mafia turncoats give personal accounts of life inside the Mob. In this shocking documentary, five high-ranking informants tell tales of murder, brutality, greed and vanity--and why they broke the Sicilian code of honor.  The first generation of the American Mafia stood on the foundation of loyalty and a code of silence. The second and third generations traded their Sicilian traditions for government protection and instant personal gain.  MOB STORIES presents five chilling narratives from five members of the underworld, most of whom are overwhelmed with fear and paranoia with the exception of \u201cFat Jackie\u201d, a loyal lifelong mobster. Father and son team, Alan and Marc Levin, direct and produce an honest and personal portrayal of the demise of the Mafia.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vMv53bp8IxGvejfiiRBxT4HxOmA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
