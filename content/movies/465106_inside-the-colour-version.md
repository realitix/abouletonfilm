A virtual, two-dimensional anaglyph flickers in red and green, unfolding a visual space true to the Brehmian aesthetic. Concentratedly condensed collisions occur between everyday life and the world, being and performing, symbols and icons. A human skull, human bodies, Castle Grafenegg as an architectonic stand-in for the uncanny ... Sex and crime, art and pop culture flicker at pixilated speed \u2013 the stuff of dreams \u2013 most penetrating however brief. The mundane alternates with the fetish, glimpsed in the blink of an eye, intersected by a long drag on a Chesterfield cigarette while the full-bodied, tube-amped slow-motion reverb sound of a guitar swings in the background.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
