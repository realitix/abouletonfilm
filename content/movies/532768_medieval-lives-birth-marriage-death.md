Why were physicians of no help to women enduring the pains of labor and the dangers of childbirth? Why were newly married couples \"put to bed\" by the priest on their wedding night? What did it mean to \"die well\" and why was death such a communal affair, both before and after it happened?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y7RppCjcpwotO9ivg0H9pz07mpy.jpg", "actors": ["Helen Castor (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
