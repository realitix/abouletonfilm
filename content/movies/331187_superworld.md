{"tmdb_id": 331187, "title": "Superworld", "original_title": "Superwelt", "slug_title": "superworld", "date": "2015-03-20", "genre": ["Drame"], "score": "6.0/10", "synopsis": "SUPERWORLD is a story about God and the world: a world whose heroine WORKS the till and a God we never see nor hear, but whose presence we feel throughout the film. Lead actress Ulrike Beimpold delivers a remarkable, moving performance as a woman under divine influence, a woman in crisis who sends shock waves through her whole family. While director Karl Markovics consistently works in a realistic mode, his narrative approach is often operatic, with elaborate bird\u2019s eye shots and strikingly composed images of biblical proportions that make God\u2019s presence manifest. Until, that is, the twilight of the gods descends and the heavens come crashing down on the plot. All good things come from above, after all. SUPERWORLD is like a small miracle. A super good one.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bSAlxNUsGgxiEIIRVkL7ZPuq2ix.jpg", "actors": ["Ulrike Beimpold (Gabi Kovanda)", "Rainer W\u00f6ss (Hannes Kovanda)", "Nikolai Gemel (Ronnie Kovanda)", "Angelika Strahser (Sabine Kovanda)", "Thomas Mraz (Georg Mikesch)", "Sibylle Kos (Helli)", "Michael Scherff (Nachbar)", "Simon Jaritz (Zeuge Jehovas)", "Kati Zambito (Zeuge Jehovas)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "TOHIA3dzAic"}
