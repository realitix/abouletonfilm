Pl\u00e1cido Domingo is Gabriele Adorno, sworn enemy of the doge of Genoa, Simon Boccanegra (Vladimir Chernov). Gabriele is in love with the beautiful Amelia (Kiri Te Kanawa at her most affecting) who turns out to be none other than the long-lost daughter the doge. James Levine\u2019s authoritative conducting of the Met orchestra and chorus reveals the dark power of Verdi\u2019s score. Performed January 26th, 1995.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5c043zo9o9J5OOXTeWVkUSi4v6c.jpg", "actors": ["Vladimir Chernov (Simon Boccanegra)", "Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (Gabriele Adorno)", "Kiri Te Kanawa (Amelia)", "Robert Lloyd (Jacobo Fiesco)", "Bruno Pola (Paolo Albiani)", "Hao Jiang Tian (Pietro)", "James Levine (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
