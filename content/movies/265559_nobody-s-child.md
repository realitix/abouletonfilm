Together with her parents and younger brother, Shuangshuang left Malaysia for Singapore. The husband and wife rented a food stall. But poor business forced Shuangshuang's father to find a job back in Malaysia, leaving his wife, Danping, to run the stall with Shuangshuang. Danping never appreciated Shuangshuang's competence. Shuangshuang's father soon stopped remitting money and even had an affair. He asked for a divorce when his lover became pregnant. In her quest to get back at her husband, Danping slept with Obit when the latter's wife was away. Shuangshuang heard on the news about how Phuket was hit by the tsunami. Worried for her mum's safety, she tried calling her in vain. Shuangshuang told Wei about how her mum could be a victim in the tsunami and how Obit violated her. Enraged, Wei confronted Obit. Shuangshuang was stabbed in the back as she tried to separate the two men.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9hUUmB4Jrif0yl5mN6stENLPMhA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
