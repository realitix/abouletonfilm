He is looking for a soft spot when the scene opens and the picturesque banks of a small stream attract his fancy. It is in the open sunlight, but a darkey likes warmth and he composes himself to take a nap. In his dreams he rises and makes his way down to the water from where there are always to be found cotton bales that make the finest sort of couches. But on his way along he passes a sailors' boarding house where men are being shipped for a long voyage. The trim sailor suits and the promise of good pay attract Rastus and almost before he knows it he has shipped for the cruise. He is outfitted at a slop shop, but already he is losing his nerve and he has to be driven on board by his captain. The ship is wrecked on the African east coast and Rastus is the sole survivor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dohsvEAkhs8g6MYJFlMJmiEL4xK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
