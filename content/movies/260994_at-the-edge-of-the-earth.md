Considered by many viewers the best Brazilian movie ever made, this feature has never been released commercially. However, in a great paradox, M\u00e1rio Peixoto has never made any other movie. The director S\u00e9rgio Machado pays a great tribute to the life and work M\u00e1rio Peixoto a.k.a. Ma\u00e7arico by his close friends with this documentary, using his diary; footages of \"Limite\", the never concluded \"Onde a Terra Acaba\" (1933) and the short \"O Homem do Morcego\" (1980); and interesting testimonies of Olga Breno, Ruy Solberg, Nelson Pereira dos Santos and Walter Salles among others.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3CBVIxcG4470W5zgWo9uUMj3TY3.jpg", "actors": ["M\u00e1rio Peixoto (Himself (archive footage))", "Matheus Nachtergaele (Narra\u00e7\u00e3o)", "Olga Breno (Herself (archive footage))", "Walter Salles ()", "Carlos Diegues ()", "Nelson Pereira dos Santos ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
