At the center of the action is the good-hearted bar owner Minnie, sung by Barbara Daniels, who takes a motherly interest in the miners. Pl\u00e1cido Domingo is Dick Johnson, also known as the bandit Ramerrez, who falls in love with Minnie. Sherrill Milnes sings Jack Rance, the sheriff who is not only determined to capture Ramerrez but also wants Minnie for himself. Bloodshed, a crooked poker game, a snowstorm, and a near lynching ensue before Minnie and her bandit-turned-lover can ride off to start a new life. Leonard Slatkin conducts one of Puccini\u2019s most colorful scores.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kzDhkOPgaEqpvZKLO2T01I0gXfb.jpg", "actors": ["Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (Dick Johnson o Ramerrez)", "Barbara Daniels (Minnie)", "Sherrill Milnes (Jack Rance)", "Anthony Laciura (Nick)", "Julien Robbins (Ashby)", "Charles Anthony (Trin)", "Kim Josephson (Sonora)", "James Courtney (Sid)", "Richard Vernon (Bello)", "Dwayne Croft (Larkens)", "Bernard Fitch (Harry)", "Leonard Slatkin (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
