For the first time on television, they hear first-hand from those involved in the show when it opened on Broadway in September 1957, including Sondheim himself, producer Hal Prince and original cast members from both show and movie, including Chita Rivera Carol Lawrence and Rita Moreno. With the BBC Symphony Orchestra and specially cast singers, we re-live some of the wonderful music and, in the company of Suzy and Bruno, we discover how West Side Story placed the 1950s phenomena of racial tension and teenage gangs centre stage to create a hit that changed musical theatre forever.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sagavdmIErt7g0IrLyBZ1km5Iy5.jpg", "actors": ["Bruno Tonioli ()", "Suzy Klein ()", "Stephen Sondheim ()", "Chita Rivera ()", "Rita Moreno ()", "Carol Lawrence ()", "Hal Prince ()", "Jerome Robbins ()", "Arthur Laurents ()", "Leonard Bernstein ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
