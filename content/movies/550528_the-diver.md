What she does comes at the cost of what she loves. She loves diving. This love demands an uncomfortable amount of self belief, perseverance and emotional investment. Insecure as she is, she does what she loves in isolation. In this way, the diver represents the things we truly love, but rarely get to, because we are so consumed by what we do.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
