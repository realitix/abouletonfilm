He tells her he can go, but when he has to work, she goes instead with Rachel, her sister who's recently dumped her philandering boyfriend. Carly and Rachel arrive, they see couples at play, the atmosphere is charged with Eros, and both have dreams that awaken their sensuality. After their first night, Doug and his partner Frank join them, but Doug is still cold. Frank and Rachel don't get along either. Encounters with the resident fortune teller and with the lodge's hostess help get good things started, then it's up to Doug and Frank, Rachel and Carly.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xMMQaVipzRVGh31JzQsOt8Ujncs.jpg", "actors": ["Landon Hall (Carly)", "Ahmo Hight (Rachel)", "Chris Johnston (Frank (as William Henderson))", "Taylor St. Claire (Rosa)", "Nikki Fritz (Zeke's Lover)", "Steve Curtis (Zeke)", "Everett Rodd (Chuck)", "Leslie Olivan (Stairway Girl)", "Stephanie Hudson (Lingerie Model (as Tonya Poole))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
