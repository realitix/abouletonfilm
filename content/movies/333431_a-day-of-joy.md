De\u0148 radosti shows Han\u00e1k using the 'inter-genre' style of documentary which made his feature film Obrazy stareho sveta (1971) a masterpiece. Still photography, live action, interviews, old etchings and archive footage of old train journeys are skilfully blended to create a sympathetic and humorous portrait of the romance of an old steam train and the joy of artists and the general public in participating in this children's game for adults. Once again, the avant-garde is imaginatively used to eulogise over traditional values and the past. De\u0148 radosti is important not just for the considerable pleasure it brings; it is the first of a series of films in which artists use film to document happenings.
