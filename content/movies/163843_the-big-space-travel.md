What sets The Great Space Voyage apart, however, is its explicit propaganda content: if you set your mind to something and persist at it, the film solemnly and sincerely reminds us, you can succeed no matter what the difficulty. (Not too dissimilar from North American-style self-empowerment!) Make sure to stick around for the end, where an actual Russian cosmonaut is on hand to deliver an inspirational message of encouragement.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tRGx7fCioVdMtfVLe2fUkT5E9Zg.jpg", "actors": ["Ludmila Berlinskaya (Sveta)", "Sergei Obrazov (Fedya)", "Igor Sakharov (Sasha)", "Lyusyena Ovchinnikova (Zoya Petrovna)", "Ninel Myshkova (Katerina)", "Zinaida Sorochinskaya ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [100638, 265235, 344799, 71018], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
