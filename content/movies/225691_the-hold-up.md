Silvia is pregnant, and her lover (her boss) won't leave his wife. Maite, newly a widow, discovers she's penniless but wants to maintain appearances and give her daughter a fancy wedding, and Pecholata, a punk kid living in a youth center, will soon be turned out on the streets. Lola, who cleans a bank every morning, decides to rob it, convincing the others to join her: they'll use replica guns, dress as men, take Silvia hostage, and all will be smooth. But things go awry, including the fact that Lola's ex, Gustavo, is a cop. Desperation may be the mother of invention - and a corrupt bank manager its father.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/htqEooaVIf2S3Lbi0UcJSZNShX8.jpg", "actors": ["Adriana Ozores (Lola)", "Malena Alterio (Violeta \"Pecholata\")", "Maribel Verd\u00fa (Silvia)", "Carmen Maura (Maite)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [264735, 80133, 143529, 115360], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
