With a burnt out caravan in tow filled with sooty household goods they make their move to a new council house.  Whilst Morran sees the opportunity for a fresh start, Tobias has lots of creative ideas about improving the house. But there is something about their new home that feels familiar, and through a series of fortuitous events the lopsided duo are once and for all forced to deal with the past.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oWT7dipe1HpIMIsPq9W7VLPe2dr.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Gustafsson (Tobias)", "Johan Rheborg (Morran)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
