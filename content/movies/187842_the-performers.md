They travel like a pack of joyful wolves, devouring powder and looking for challenges. Just 26 minutes in length, the film offers ferocious detail, with ski footage that still holds up today.  The film revealed the ski culture as a surrogate family. In an interview years later, skier Charlie McWilliams recalled how people came up to him to explain how they deeply identified with this happygo- lucky skiing clan. He saw the film as a groundbreaking portrayal of skiing as a tribal experience. \u201cIt was the first time anybody had gone out and made a film of a group of guys traveling around the country having a great time skiing.\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hghFOMukRFlbcCBkmbPC5JAbGwe.jpg", "actors": ["Charlie McWilliams (Himself)", "Pat Bauman (Himself)", "John Clendenin (Himself)", "Bob Griswold (Himself)", "Jim Stelling (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "CP3wU677tcg"}
