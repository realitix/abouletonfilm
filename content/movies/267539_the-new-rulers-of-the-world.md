But what is globalisation? And where is this global village? In 2001, John Pilger made 'The New Rulers of the World', a film exploring the impact of globalisation. It took Indonesia as the prime example, a country that the World Bank described as a 'model pupil' until its 'globalised' economy collapsed in 1998. Globalisation has not only made the world smaller. It has also made it interdependent. An investment decision made in London can spell unemployment for thousands in Indonesia, while a business decision taken in Tokyo can create thousands of new jobs for workers in north-east England.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/awDI0tD9z5BZi6NSHYuuVUHH7yF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
