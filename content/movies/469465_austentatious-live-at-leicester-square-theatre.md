Every performance is made up on the spot based simply on a title suggested by the audience, so be it \u201cMansfield Shark\u201d, \u201cDarcy and Hutch\u201d or \u201cI Know What You Did Last Season\u201d, no two shows are the same. Performed in period costume with live cello accompaniment, Austentatious is an immersive and hilarious treat for fans of Austen and improvised comedy alike.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bmBovXSLWvUCmkOGeulO33fEDTz.jpg", "actors": ["Amy Cooke-Hodgson (Herself)", "Andrew Hunter Murray (Himself)", "Cariad Lloyd (Herself)", "Charlotte Gittins (Herself)", "Daniel Nils Roberts (Himself)", "Graham Dickson (Himself)", "Joseph Morpurgo (Himself)", "Rachel Parris (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
