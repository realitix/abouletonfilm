It's going to be tacky, cheeky, bonkers, perhaps cheap and firmly aimed at a section of the horror movie faithful who enjoy such nutty and bloody delights.\r\n\r\nZombeavers is not a great film of course, but for the sub-genre of horror it sits in it's actually better than many bigger comedy/horror productions that have been churned out in the last three decades. Don't get me wrong, it's no Tucker & Dale vs. Evil, but there's a whole bunch of fun to be had watching the makers purposely tick of the clich\u00e9s and requisite requirements for such cinematic fare. Some adroit gags exist in amongst the the booby flesh and animatronic chaos, with the dialogue often as razor sharp as the teeth on the disturbed genus Castor beings.\r\n\r\nIt is never going to be making any horror fan's best of list, and only the infected of mind would heartily recommend it as a must see. But it is a fun picture if you are in the mood to leave your brain at the Beaver Lodge. 6/10"}, {"pseudo": "Gimly", "content": "Many B-Horror movies try to be awful in the best possible way, most fail, _Zombeavers_ succeeds.\r\n\r\nFinal rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I personally recommend you give it a go."}], "recommandations_id": [276488, 241842, 172828, 43919], "youtube_key": "7onFrBK_hKE"}
