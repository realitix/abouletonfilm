With Indian actors who act, dance, sing and smother themselves with tomato sauce when feigning a bloody head wound. Now, watch the image with the sound turned down! And let Pascal Legitimus and Eric Le Roch re-invent a story, recreate the sounds and the atmosphere, rewrite the lyrics to the songs. They'll give a new meaning to the film, helped in doing so by many well-known actors, who'll lend their voices to the Indian actors on screen. This diversion isn't a danger to your health. You simply risk killing yourself laughing!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/22yAzJfPEMZsbKHhC9o6C7sR6qq.jpg", "actors": ["Pascal L\u00e9gitimus (Bobby (voice))", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Fougerolles (Paula (voice))", "Mathilda May (Fanny (vocie))", "Simon Abkarian (Gunter (voice))", "Serge Hazanavicius (Le groom (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
