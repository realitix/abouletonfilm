He was already the voice from the void; he was James the Boptist, a hard-partying rock \u2018n\u2019 roller that pioneered a new genre of Afrikaans rock music (despite being English) that sparked and fired a revolution. He was working with heavy-hitters William Kentridge and Warrick Sony on Faustus in Africa, staged in Grahamstown in 1995.  This is a rollicking musical ride through all these incarnations, with frank insights from 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s musicians and leftie luminaries \u2013 from Johannes Kerkorrel to Lloyd Ross, Pieter-Dirk Uys to Zapiro by way of the Radio Rats\u2019 Jonathan Handley and Vusi Mahlasela.  It\u2019s an intimate portrait of a wildly talented poet painted by those who knew him best.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AjkwGs33GDMGjSXnJwoOT4EfYiY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "WOI-7zByQrM"}
