For most of the hour, as the concise narration of Marguerite Duras' novel on eroticism and aesthetics fills the aural gaps, actress Marie Colbin's form fills the visual gaps. But unless viewers consider the feminine eyeball or microscopic views of skin exotic and worth lingering over, the eroticism lies more in the imagination than on the screen. In fact, the female body lying on the bed, taken away from the spirit that animates it, is really just a corpse -- raising the question, exactly what is the \"malady of death?\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v2bknZ8jNTIP1X5lp3ou1X54sw9.jpg", "actors": ["Marie Colbin ()", "Peter Handke ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
