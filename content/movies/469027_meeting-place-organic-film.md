Since 1973, the McQuails have been helping to build the organic farming community and support the next generation of organic farmers. This is a documentary about the McQuails that explores the very real ways their farm has contributed to the long term ecological viability of agriculture in Ontario. It is a call to action for all those who believe there is a better way to take care of our planet and feed the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6z9OkAORKMZTLYpO2eTqTDgbmx8.jpg", "actors": ["James Anthony McQuail ()", "Frances McQuail ()", "Rachel McQuail ()", "Katrina McQuail ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
