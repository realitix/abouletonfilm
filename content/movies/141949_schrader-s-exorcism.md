Schrader, after being fired from the production and his version of the film shelved, is brought back 2 years later to complete it on a shoestring budget. In true cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style we watch as Schrader and editor Tim Silano work all the angles to get the film on its feet and over to Europe for the world premiere.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jXFLbvlNG6s7oZqn7DaB4XDjQOG.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Schrader (Himself)", "Tim Silano (Himself)", "Vittorio Storaro (Himself)", "Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd (Himself)", "Ralph Brown (Himself)", "Gabriel Mann (Himself)", "Antonie Kamerling (Himself)", "Clara Bellar (Herself)", "Billy Crawford (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "rbHQrBmxEDc"}
