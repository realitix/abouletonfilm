In this outstandingly authentic and elegant production from the Sferisterio Opera Festival, Puccini's highly emotional music is expertly delivered. The superior cast is headed by Raffaella Angeletti, \"certainly one of the best Butterflies of our time\" (ForumOpera.com), who has performed this role in many Italian theatres, as well as in Madrid and at the Vienna Staatsoper.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pQgps51JDakAUaXVFn6eSl5ntgQ.jpg", "actors": ["Raffaella Angeletti (Cio-Cio-San (Butterfly))", "Annunziata Vestri (Suzuki)", "Massimiliano Pisapia (B.F.
