Not surprisingly, in an era renowned for its heavy industry, freight workings and the locomotives designed for heavy goods duties, play a prominent role in the proceedings. There is much coverage of the LNWR designed G2 class 0-8-0 tender engines, the last LNWR class to survive in any numbers. These engines are contrasted with their LMS built successors, the 8F 2-8-0s. Other types which feature in the films are Black 5s, Horwich Moguls, Fowler tanks, Jinties, Ivatt 2-6-0s and several of the British Railways Standard designs ranging from Britannia Pacifics to the Class 4 Moguls. These machines, often work stained and unkempt, are seen on a succession of coal and steel trains and long mixed freights, traffic flows which have either been shut down or nowadays go by road. Passenger traffic is not forgotten.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7ORa2AwOeSGLF0OEinId832Elki.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
