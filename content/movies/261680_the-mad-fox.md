Dispensing with naturalism, Uchida uses expressionist sets and color schemes to convey the shifting states of mind of a protagonist driven mad by grief after his lover is killed. Some scenes are shot against theatrical backdrops inspired by kabuki theater and traditional dance; others unfold on elaborately colored sets reminiscent of traditional screen paintings. The Mad Fox\u2019s audacious artifice makes Masaki Kobayashi\u2019s Kwaidan (1964) pale in comparison.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gnjSq31qtRjmw9XXeCHvHKUzUFr.jpg", "actors": ["Hashiz\u00f4 Ohkawa (Abe no Yasuna)", "Michiko Saga (Sakaki no mae / Kuzu no ha / Vixen)", "Ry\u00fbnosuke Tsukigata (Onono Yosifuru)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
