Responding superbly to the role, Swedish soprano Nina Stemme \u2013 she of the richly clear voice \u2013 offers an Aida vibrant with love and emotion.  Heading a magnificent cast, she makes a poignant couple with talented tenor Salvatore Licitra as Radam\u00e8s. Luciana d\u2019Intino is nothing less than brilliant in the role of Aida\u2019s rival Amneris and Juan Pons imbues his Amonasro with enormous humanity.
