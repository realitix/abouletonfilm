Prussian aesthete Herman Beyer is on the verge of divorcing wife Corinna Harfouch. Radical writer Uwe Kokisch, Corinna's lover, hopes to find a way of smoothing out animosities. What follows, however, is a nonstop drinking binge. The film subliminally addresses the then-prevalent issue of a divided Germany. Whether or not it succeeds is unimportant; Treffen in Travers (Reunion in Travers) has proven to be a crowd pleaser wherever it has been shown.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7niyy57Rvmx2CKtS1vPlGyqBnCu.jpg", "actors": ["Hermann Beyer (Georg Forster)", "Corinna Harfouch (Therese Forster)", "Uwe Kockisch (Ferdinand Huber)", "Peter Dommisch ()", "Heide Kipp (Marthe)", "Hark Bohm (B\u00fcrgermeister)", "Michael Kind ()", "Johannes Gwisdek ()", "Robert Gwisdek ()", "Astrid Krenz ()", "Wolf-Dietrich K\u00f6llner ()", "Herbert Olschok ()", "Susanne Bormann ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
