His \"prize\" at the end of a long day of risky work is sitting close to Ana, who lives with her mother and young daughter, as she savors the drama of urban sophisticates on her favorite soap opera.  Ana dreams of leaving the village to see the world. Jusce is content with the life he leads. The other fishermen, friends of Jusce's dead father, help him to buy and fit out his own fishing boat. One day an old friend, Rog\u00e9rio, returns from the big city to work giving dune buggy rides along the coast. The day Rog\u00e9rio gives Jusce a ride to Ana's place marks the beginning of their rivalry for Ana's attention. Jusce has to reinvent himself in order not to lose Ana to the adventurous life style of Rog\u00e9rio.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r0FADjEGIEhFfxdefJyvWN3jB2W.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
