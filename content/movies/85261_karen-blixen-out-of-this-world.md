A journey that not only documents her extraordinary life, her extensive travels and the people she encountered-but one which also depicts the era in which she lived. A time of adventure, eccentric aristocrats, and of unending possibility and immeasurable hardship.\r Introduced by actress Meryl Streep, Karen Blixen\u2212Out of this World tells the real story behind the inspiration for the Academy Award winning film, Out of Africa.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AiZsI0GNC0s5rpXITYHl28RL0AI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
