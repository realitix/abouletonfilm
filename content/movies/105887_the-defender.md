He contacts a notorious hacker for help. Meanwhile, Takashi's world is turning upside down. He's robbed at knifepoint &amp; then chased through the crowded Tokyo streets by a giant. Or maybe not. Perhaps the microchip is only making him think these things are happening.  Soon he realizes there's a connection between all the bizarre traumas and a girl named Masami. Seemingly, all his troubles started when she visited his repair shop and asked him to fix her cd rom-unit. Eventually Takashi finds himself psychically linked to the girl. As it turns out, they are secret government-made humanoids, programmed to live undetected within society an then - when the need should arise - they are activated as professional fighters; The action of the movie itself plays like the Defender arcade game.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oifhyVQG1IdBrGLzcCSdrwi0Z7T.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
