At any rate Martin, who is indifferent to pets in general, isn't doing all too well in his marketing job at Floppy Dog Foods. But right now this is the least of his problems: he has made a British au-pair pregnant in a one night stand; and while he is trying to figure out how to deal with this, his ex-wife (who divorced him over his not wanting children) and his mother (a militant anti-overpopulation, pro-birth control, pro-abortion activist) have a few comments to offer on the situation. Before his own child is born, Martin clearly has some growing up of his own to do.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Tom Novembre (Martin)", "Sabine Haudepin (Genevi\u00e8ve)", "Isabelle Townsend (Sally)", "Catherine Samie (Antoinette)", "Patrick Braoud\u00e9 (Julien)", "Jean Rougerie (Fontanet)", "Clotilde Baudon (V\u00e9ronique)", "Marie-Laure Dougnac (Nadine)", "Anne Kreis (La femme sage)", "Luc Palun (Le gardien de la fourri\u00e8re)", "Caroline Gasser (Solange)", "Olivier Broche (Le cadre de Floppy)", "Jacques Audiard (L'antiquaire)", "Pierre-Isaie Duc (Le futur papa)", "Jean Cherlian (L'\u00e9leveur)", "Andr\u00e9e Saldo (La vieille dame)", "Paul Berardi (Le v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire)", "G\u00e9raldine Renoue (La militante)", "Ariane Ascaride (Eliane)", "Patrick Bonnel (Bruno)", "Dimitri Rougeul (Mathieu)", "No\u00e9mie Orphelin (C\u00e9cile)", "Jules Floquet (Guillaume)", "Quentin Hue (Fabien)", "Maeva Pitel (Evelyne)", "Alexandre Lambret (Le b\u00e9b\u00e9)", "Jos\u00e9phine Serre (La pyromane)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
