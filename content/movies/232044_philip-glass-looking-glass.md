He speaks about his beginnings, his moving to Paris for two years of intensive study with Nadia Boulanger, his meeting with Indian musician Ravi Shankar and director Robert Wilson, who had a deep influence on his career. The film also shows him at work on the last details of his opera The Sound of a Voice, directed by Robert Woodruff and conducted by Alan Johnson.  \u00c9ric Darmon's camera, with its poetic shots and original framings, takes us for a musical journey into seven months of the life of the composer who, rising from the underground scene of the seventies, brought on a revolution in modern theater.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ftChxWQjjOGv0XjD1qp485ZpSj4.jpg", "actors": ["Philip Glass (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
