In this romantic drama, based on a short story by the great existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, Lucie tests the waters by having a fling with another man (Christian Izard) on the advice of a friendly shopkeeper. Meanwhile, her husband is treating her to such intimate kindnesses as scolding her for her mental sloppiness in watching television without consulting the channel guide.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h5qq6hAiC7dpv74zR2lEe3zsAFb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
