So to celebrate their first 25 years together, Sub Pop got the band to haul all of their gear up to the top of Seattle's Space Needle to do a half-hour set. This is probably the highest off the ground that the band has ever performed, but the small club atmosphere followed them up there.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1qofQdMkmY0gCq5x20nqv6zaPJc.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Arm (Performer)", "Steve Turner (Performer)", "Guy Maddison (Performer)", "Dan Peters (Performer)", "Mudhoney (Performers)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
