Good References was her sixth and final release of 1920, with a plot revolving around a down-on-her-luck woman named Mary (played by Talmadge) whose lack of references makes it impossible for her to gain employment.  When a friend falls ill, Mary impersonates her in order to take a job as secretary to an elderly socialite.  Things immediately start going downhill when she is tasked to introduce a ne'er-do-well nephew to high society\u2014but ends up bailing him out of a string of scandals instead.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cjp8sVNNVmzVkhDAWC1pg1KIMjH.jpg", "actors": ["Constance  Talmadge (Mary Wayne)", "Vincent Coleman (William Marshall)", "Ned Sparks (Peter Stearns)", "Nellie Parker Spaulding (Aunt Caroline)", "Mona Lisa (Nell Norcross (as Mona Liza))", "Dorothy Walters (Landlady)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
