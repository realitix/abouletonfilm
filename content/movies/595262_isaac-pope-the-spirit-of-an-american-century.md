Grandson of enslaved people, son of sharecroppers, he yearned toward the American Dream, never came near it, but spent decades helping others do so. His life shows tectonic shifts in some interactions between races that show the way forward.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
