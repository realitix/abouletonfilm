The gnu calf strays from the herd and comes upon a lioness that kidnaps it. Instinctively, it treats the lion like its mother. And miraculously enough, the lioness does not see the calf as its prey. Like a true Survivor, the calf manages to escape from the lion's den and find its way back to its real mother.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Thom Hoffman (voice-over)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
