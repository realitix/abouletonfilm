She's dedicated her life to trying to document the wacky things she sees through the lens of a camera, and on video. She is a proud member of Ghost Hunter Girls, and shares her struggle online. One day Dahlia Skywalker pipes up on chat to get a hold of Samantha, even saying she'll fly across the country in order to meet her. Dahlia explains that she's a wiccan. Samantha is surprised there are others like her out there and intently listens to Dahlia's story.
