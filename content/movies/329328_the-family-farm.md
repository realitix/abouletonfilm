In its journey across the country, the film blends extraordinary shots of the Canadian farm landscape with discussions of the challenges and setbacks small farmers endure, as well as the turning points and breakthroughs that have allowed them to achieve success. As these intimate accounts are shared, traditional images of family farmers are redefined as we grow to see these individuals not only as farmers, but as teachers, botanists, and mechanics who open our eyes to the issues that continue to threaten small farmers as well as the importance of buying local and organic foods.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b6pWl2JfS2v7yBteAyCYEC9Xsx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "t60xMswH9n0"}
