But this time it will be a journey without return. Shortly after her departure Lena is killed in a bus accident near Bremen. Her death gives up Hermann R\u00e4tsel. Why did she die in the north, when she wanted to go to the south? When, as every year in November, a postcard from Lena arrives from Italy, Hermann sets off in search of the truth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iW3R2bJPM6ZfqrI6I3r0yQMlpoM.jpg", "actors": ["G\u00f6tz George (Henry)", "Burghart Klau\u00dfner (Hermann Droemer)", "Bernadette Heerwagen (Susanne Droemer)", "Barbara Auer (Lena Droemer)", "Henriette Confurius (Niko)", "Charlotte L\u00fcder (Leonie)", "Godehard Giese (Gerald)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
