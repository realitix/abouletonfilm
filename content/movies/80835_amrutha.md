Screenplay of the film is good, but not tight. Taking of the shots is excellent. Direction is extraordinary when is come to the individual scenes. There are three scenes in which he leaves his mark strongly on us. One of that is the flashback narration to Amrutha after which the entire flashback is shown like Simran is reading it from a book. Second scene is the one in which the daughter and mother meets in the climax. Third one is Amrutha talking to a stranger in Sri Lanka who later on turn out to be a suicide bomber who blasts himself by jumping on to an army convoy. But Mani Ratnam should have considered inserting commercial elements to make it a movie more commercially viable.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uRKFd8NGXfTJZmPhsAUESSesbOl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
