At the time, my son was 4 months old and I was spending a significant amount of time at home. Working under this circumstance, which I viewed as a convenience and a constraint, I made work that utilized and reconsidered the manufactured purpose of objects that I found in or near our apartment. In this case: a light bulb, microwave, mason jar, and a bath towel. I brought these objects together in an attempt to create a sense of self-entertainment through the production of a homemade magic show or no-frills special effect.\"", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
