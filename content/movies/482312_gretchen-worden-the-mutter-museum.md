As director of The Mutter Museum, she presides over preserved, mummified and mounted remains of human oddities. Glass jars line her walls, each containing a freak of nature, a grossly deformed corpse or body parts. Both the collection and Worden's grave\u00adside manner are chilling but compelling. Errol Morris giggles nervously in the face of death.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
