The Range Busters, Dusty, Davy and Alibi, are selected to take the horses there but, before leaving, they capture three spies who are trying to steal the horses and also learn that the ranch cook, Cookie, is a Japanese spy, but he manages to escape. In the Philippines, they go to a caf\u00e9 for dinner and see Cookie and Miller, a German spy. Eavesdropping, they learn that Ken Richards, a neighboring Texas rancher, is the Axis contact back in the states. They capture Cookie and break up the spy ring in the Phillipines, and then return to Texas intent on settling matters with Richards. They do so and are honored by the U.S. Government just as the radio blares forth the December 7, 1941 announcement of the Pearl Harbor bombing. They head for the nearest enlistment station.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/choilp78Yl6v8axwMdUGUl9D19X.jpg", "actors": ["John 'Dusty' King (Dusty King)", "Max Terhune (Alibi Terhune)", "David Sharpe (Davy Sharpe)", "Elmer (Elmer Sneezeweed - Alibi's Dummy)", "Marjorie Manners (Dallas Conroy)", "Steve Clark (Tom Conroy)", "Budd Buster (Tad Kelton)", "Escolastico Baucin (Cookie)", "Frank Ellis (Ken Richards)", "Kenne Duncan (Captain Anders (as Kenneth Duncan))", "Guy Kingsford (Miller)", "Carl Mathews (Engel)", "Tex Palmer (Grub)", "Tom Steele (Lemac-Truck Driver)", "Al Ferguson (Cafe Henchman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
