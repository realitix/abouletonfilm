Mark Adams (John Gabriel) is an FBI agent who has been assigned to infiltrate an organized crime ring that has obtained a set of printing plates that will allow them to produce nearly perfect counterfeit 20-dollar bills. The plates were made in Germany during World War II, and were discovered by a radical right-wing group hoping to restore the Nazi Party to power. The American gangsters are in cahoots with a group of wealthy American neo-Nazis sympathetic to the new German cause, led by fugitive war criminal Count von Delberg (Kent Taylor); the count has in turn recruited a vicious motorcycle gang, the Bloody Devils, to do his dirty work.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nY8ZzoJT3CuOTp0mGzDQmG1cGsZ.jpg", "actors": ["Broderick Crawford (Gavin)", "Scott Brady (Brand)", "Kent Taylor (Count von Delberg)", "Anne Randall (Amanda Whitfield)", "Vicki Volante (Carol Bechtal)", "John Carradine (Pet Shop Owner)", "John Gabriel (Mark Adams)", "Erin O'Donnell (Leni Marvenga)", "Jack Starrett (Rocky)", "Robert Dix (Cunk)", "Bambi Allen (Pick-up Girl)", "Leslie McRae (Maggie)", "Gene Otis Shayne (Driker)", "Greydon Clark (Bloody Devil)", "Gary Kent (Bloody Devil)", "William Bonner (Bloody Devil)", "John 'Bud' Cardos (Bloody Devil)", "Ken Osborne (Bloody Devil (as Kent Osborne))", "Sheldon Lee (-)", "Keith Andes (Joe Bremonte)", "Jane Wald (Girl on Boat)", "Harland Sanders (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
