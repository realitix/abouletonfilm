Fuentes' Bontoc Eulogy is a haunting, personal exploration into the filmmaker's complex relationship with his Filipino heritage as explored through the almost unbelievable story of the 1,100 Filipino tribal natives brought to the U.S. to be a \"living exhibit\" at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. For those who associate the famous fair with Judy Garland, clanging trolleys, and creampuff victoriana, Bontoc Eulogy offers a disturbing look at the cultural arrogance that went hand-in-hand with the Fair's glorification of progress. The Fair was the site of the world's largest ever \"ethnological display rack,\" in which hundreds of so-called primitive and savage men and women from all over the globe were exhibited in contrast to the achievements of Western civilization.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/doRiWqKdOVAJ2ayckIQ9aZ4rgUX.jpg", "actors": ["Marlon Fuentes (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
