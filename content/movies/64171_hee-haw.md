It aired on CBS-TV from 1969\u20131971 before a 20-year run in local syndication. The show was inspired by Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In,[1] the major difference being that Hee Haw was far less topical, and was centered on country music. Initially co-hosted by musicians Buck Owens and Roy Clark, the show was equally well-known for its voluptuous, scantily-clad women in stereotypical farmer's daughter outfits, male stars Jim and Jon Hager and its cornpone humor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sMHCX9mFH4JcCJWVkHK2lBfzZnr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
