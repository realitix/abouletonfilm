However, the world economy has since transformed profoundly, but the US education system has not. Schools are attempting to teach and test skills, when mastered, that still leave graduates woefully unprepared for the 21st Century. After presenting this problem, the documentary focuses on the story of a school in San Diego that is completely rethinking what the experience of going to school looks like. As we follow students, parents and teachers through a truly unorthodox school experience, the audience is forced to consider what sort of educational environment is most likely to succeed in the 21st century?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ksbjCDnc2HEkC0nWrLoYnVVA66m.jpg", "actors": ["Scott Swaaley (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [43765], "youtube_key": "bn7LsWDdrx0"}
