Improvised open-air galleries in public places are his preferred means of displaying his so-called 'recycling art'. He welcomes admirers of his work to take possession of them for free, and some people become avid collectors.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
