He looks at it from the top of a hill and feels like a stranger, having left years ago. He seems to recognize the surrounding landscape but, at the same time, feels unable to remember this environment that attracts and repels him. Conflicted, he searches for familiar friends, acquaintances, places and a daughter, who reached out to him so long ago. Finally discovering a haven where he feels at home, he leaves again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h5w2OeTLbMLl5HgPcIDs0aV0rSR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
