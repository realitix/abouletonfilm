One showdown that never actually happened turned this game into one of hockey legend. Shortly after Boston\u2019s John Wensink and Minnesota\u2019s Alex Pirus got untangled from their fight, Wensink famously skated over to the North Stars bench and motioned for the whole team to take him on. They didn\u2019t. Through Wensink\u2019s own words and anecdotes from die-hard fans, family, and fellow NHL players, this film takes us into the mind-set of the Bruins\u2019 most legendary enforcer \u2014 and the journey one takes when that life is left behind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vRfrrrvtQVwvVIBaTbSliXLmEXU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
