But rather than face the embarrassment of calling off the ceremony, Alison suggests to Phil that they proceed with a sham wedding. Phil is more than game to try, secretly hoping that a surprise gift he has for Alison will ultimately change her mind.  Yet once the guests begin to arrive, more complications ensue than either of them could have ever imagined - even if they did know their wedding was bullshit.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v0IES76O7jjeC3Sf73suMppIQKp.jpg", "actors": ["Philip Quinaz (Phil Havemeyer)", "Alison Fyhrie (Alison Jones)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "pmDqfRT58c8"}
