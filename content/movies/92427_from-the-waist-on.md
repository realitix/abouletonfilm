To help him cope with loneliness, she decides to write every day a sweet, passionate love letter. But as she is unable to express her feelings in words, she seeks help from her friend Katia (Capotini Christian), who lives confined to a wheelchair. These letters, in principle, should express the feelings of Rosalba, but finish reflecting those of Katia, who wins the heart of Danilo. The result is a love that will struggle to overcome any barrier.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gR0ITPV2L91TgVcWb6Qs49Yqfmc.jpg", "actors": ["Cristiana Capotondi (Katia)", "Filippo Nigro (Danilo)", "Nicoletta Romanoff (Rosalba)", "Pino Insegno ()", "Carlo Buccirosso ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
