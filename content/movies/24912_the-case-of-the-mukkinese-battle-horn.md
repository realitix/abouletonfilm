Along the way he meets characters not dissimilar to Eccles, Henry Crun and Minnie Bannister from The Goon Show. This attempt to adapt Goon humour to the big screen was written by Harry Booth, Jon Penington and regular Goon show co-writer Larry Stephens. It was then heavily rewritten on the filmset by Sellers and Milligan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hWmRI9Fc734UKtQB7KWatVjia9c.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Sellers (Assorted)", "Spike Milligan (Assorted)", "Dick Emery (Mr. Nodule)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "mBiVe__-Vik"}
