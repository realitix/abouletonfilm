But, if you climb the stairs the second floor, you'll find a roller skating rink that is over 50 years old. Behind the counter of both the post office and the rink you'll find Miss Doris. 'All Skate, Everybody Skate' is a portrait of a woman in her late seventies who has known hard times and met them with head-on with grit and an extraordinary work ethic that has kept her climbing that wooden staircase each evening to rent and repair skates, spin vintage 45s, and weave smoothly in-between the tourists in her white skates with the red wheels.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Doris Jenkins (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
