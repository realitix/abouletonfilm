The author and the film director walk among them all the time, contemplating, laughing at their plays. The stories starting from the graveyard and returning there warn of the inevitability of death. The author and the director (Gyula Hern\u00e1di and Mikl\u00f3s Jancs\u00f3) wisely make friends with death.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uqqny1O3mcfJUJDPb9F3USjfb8E.jpg", "actors": ["Zolt\u00e1n Mucsi (Kapa)", "P\u00e9ter Scherer (Pepe)", "Szarvas J\u00f3zsef (J\u00f3zsi)", "Mikl\u00f3s Jancs\u00f3 (Himself)", "Gyula Hern\u00e1di (Himself)", "Emese Vasv\u00e1ri (Emese)", "Zsolt Kov\u00e1cs (Zsolti)", "Gy\u00f6rgy Feh\u00e9r (Gy\u00f6rgy)", "J\u00f3zsef B\u00f6jte (J\u00f3zsi b\u00e1csi)", "Csoma Judit (Judit)", "Anger Zsolt (Anger)", "Istv\u00e1n M\u00e1rton (Pista / Cemetery director)", "Bal\u00e1zs Galk\u00f3 (Galk\u00f3)", "Szonja Oroszl\u00e1n (Interpreter)", "Vir\u00e1g Csap\u00f3 (Enik\u0151)", "Andr\u00e1s Lovasi (The singer)", "Zolee Ganxsta (Himself)", "Gy\u00f6rgy Ferenczi (Gyuri)", "J\u00e1cint Juh\u00e1sz ()", "Mih\u00e1ly Szabados ()", "Attila R\u00e1cz ()", "Ferenc Nov\u00e1k ()", "Andrea Lad\u00e1nyi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [104707, 8776, 158713, 40987], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
