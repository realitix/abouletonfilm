Bilio\u2019s teacher, Platon Papadakis, is also in love with her, but besides serenading her, he also punishes her and during school breaks keeps her in the classroom. With the help of the headmistress, who is in love with Platon, the news of the love of the teacher for his student spreads throughout the small community. Platon now has to face Fotis, the headmistress and Bilio\u2019s father \u2013 who is the president of the community \u2013 who makes sure the naughty teacher is transferred and a woman teacher is appointed in his place. Platon, nevertheless, manages to return to the school dressed up as the new teacher, in order to kidnap Bilio. The latter, however, refuses to follow him.
