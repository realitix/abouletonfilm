True, there were others before him (Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison come to mind), but the Sir Douglas Quintet counterattacked the British invasion of the mid 1960's with their own brand of Chicano-influenced rock that they had been playing around their hometown of San Antonio. This performance, recorded October 14, 1975, came after Doug had temporarily retired the Sir Douglas name, but features original member Augie Meyer along with musical compadres Martin Steitle, John Barber, Steve McDaniels and Harry Hess.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kuzJbxNPC492aVoQXfmLGm33pwF.jpg", "actors": ["Doug Sahm (Himself (vocals, guitars, fiddle))", "Augie Meyers (Himself (keyboards, guitar, vocals))", "Martin Steitle (Himself (drums))", "Jack Barber (Himself (bass))", "Steve McDaniels (Himself (drums))", "Harry Hess (Himself (steel guitar, guitar))", "Bobby Earl Smith (Himself (guitar))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "JxsWRDeuxTE"}
