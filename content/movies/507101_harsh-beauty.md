But the elevated role they once held has now faded. Today they live in isolated communities, working as prostitutes and beggars. Life may be hard but inside the community, there's a real sense of warmth and camaraderie. 'Harsh Beauty' follows the lives of Jyothi, Usha and Hira Bai, three Eunuchs who struggle for acceptance in a culture splintered by religion, caste and politics. Filmed over four years and accompanied by a vibrant soundtrack, it's a warm and poignant look inside this usually hidden group.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hxpH7QoF6oepgKoOCSXlilWKWP3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
