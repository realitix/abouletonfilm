Jump, shout, twist and crawl and dance to the tunes of Ska and its anthems of its rough riders and three-minute heroes captivated in the moment of a generation of England's concrete jungles and razor blade alley's. No longer on your radio but now on stage, together, with the likes of Madness, The Specials and The Beat et al, this concert footage of an era is a must-see, rare and fascinating look into a once vibrant youth culture of working-class England and its musical dance craze", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wcLA6DVtn6cjNobqgT0M5f7Vh1K.jpg", "actors": ["Buster Bloodvessel (Himself)", "Suggs (Himself)", "Terry Hall (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "rQpCPEw8Yv4"}
