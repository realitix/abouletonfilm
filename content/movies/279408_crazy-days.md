They usually spend time in a local pub playing cards, drinking and yelling. Jure is the most successful and bragging among them, while Klempo is considered poorest since he didn't built the house or bought a car. Annoyed by poor cards, Klempo places a bet with Jure that he made more money than him. The loser must give everything to winner and then walk around the town naked.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nrcvYnLMsVOAjMI4fqWE7tYu1cf.jpg", "actors": ["Zvonko Lepeti\u0107 (Jure Frani\u0107)", "Ilija Ivezi\u0107 (Joso Ma\u010dkovi\u0107)", "Spaso Papac (Klempo)", "Perica Martinovi\u0107 (Cvita)", "Bo\u017eidar Boban (Ive, truba\u010d)", "Niko Pavlovi\u0107 (Niko, mladi\u0107 koji odlazi u Njema\u010dku)", "Hermina Pipini\u0107 (Janja)", "Marija Sekelez (Jele, kuma)", "Petar Dobri\u0107 (Martin)", "Vladimir Medar (Profesor)", "Du\u0161ko Ercegovi\u0107 (Stipe, karta\u0161)", "Marinko Dodig (Kibicer)", "Terezija Dadi\u0107-Lepeti\u0107 (Kate)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
