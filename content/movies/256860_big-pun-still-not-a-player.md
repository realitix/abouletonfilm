From his blood and spit struggles on the mean streets to his rise to the top of the hip-hop world to this large man's losing war with his 700-pound bulk. This unique, frightening, ugly, painful, haunting, and occasionally, beautiful story is a high-steppin' razor that slashes into the heart, bones and belly of one of hip-hop's greatest players, offering unquestionably the most intimate look ever inside the hard world of hip-hop and into the ravaged yet hopeful life of one of its most popular and legendary figures.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Big Pun (Himeself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
