I\u2019m shot up with so much cortisone I feel like the Hulk.\u201d Even when he\u2019s not feeling the greatest, the singer-songwriter\u2019s unique sense of humor remains perfectly intact.\r Opening with the lead single from his eponymous album, \u2018Gimme Something Good,\u2019 the concert featured tunes from throughout Adams\u2019 career, including both solo and Cardinals material. For those lucky fans in attendance \u2014 and the thousands who were watching at home via iTunes \u2014 Adams did an amazing job of putting new spins on familiar tunes; this was evident in the opening of \u2018Fix It\u2019 and \u2018Let It Ride,\u2019 both of which never lost their original appeal, but featured subtly different arrangements.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5FCEOIcFdgIrYMZuKUiNEAY7Xco.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
