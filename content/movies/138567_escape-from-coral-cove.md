They waterski. They dive. They are jealous. They are potential final girls. One of 'em is called Four-Eyes (Louis Kong) and has a little brother.  After hours of painful \"excitement\" with them, a friendly dead guy (Roy Cheung) starts to kill off the annoying people. Instead of thanking the dead guy or making him president of the yacht club or something, a security guard calls his uncle, a buddhist exorcist.  Too bad for him that he's a crap exorcist, and doesn't survive the meeting with dead guy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/miPu6WW4irHUN8fdn7GBrf08GjT.jpg", "actors": ["Elsie Chan (San-San)", "Joh Yin-Ling (Chen-Chen)", "Louis Kong (Tak Chai)", "Alex Fong Chung-Sun (Alex (as Fu Lik))", "Yuen-Ching Leung (Irene)", "Roy Cheung (The Creature)", "Wong Mei-Wa (Bonnie)", "Wu Fung (Priest Ming Suk)", "Marilyn Bautista (Female Diver)", "Chun Wong (Mr. Chun)", "Yu Miu-Lin (Mr. Chun's Girlfriend)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
