It has all the action and drama you'd want from a vampire hunter film, but it dials up the comedy with little quips and one liners. It also uses clich\u00e9s in a way that is refreshingly not clich\u00e9! The key is that the actors play the gags and clich\u00e9s very seriously which makes them all the more funny and exciting at the same time. \r\n\r\nJack (Josh Rothman) and Padre (Roberto Lombardi) lead a team of vampire slayers and are the only survivors of an ambush by vampire leader Monty (Christian Chase). But while Padre gets away, Jack has been bitten by Monty and now has one day before he becomes a vampire himself!\r\n\r\nAfter returning to a safe house, Jack tells Padre of his dilemma and both decide to take down Monty and his crew before Jack is turned.\r\n\r\nOther notable performances are by Athena Brensberger (\"Heather\"), Mackenzie Medwin (\"Ruby\") and genre star Seregon O'Dassey (\"Jewel\")\r\n\r\nAlong with the comedy and action, there are a few heartfelt scenes that really show the versatility of the actors involved. Chris R. Notarile also shines with fantastic writing, a great blend of practical and digital effects, amazing locations and beautiful cinematography.\r\n\r\nI would love a full feature film of Turned that includes a bit of back story and a bit of what happens after this short ends!"}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "0e8xj9hY0GI"}
