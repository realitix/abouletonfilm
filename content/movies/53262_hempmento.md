One day, however, they discover that their treasured Kind Bud is missing. Someone has stolen it and left a clue as to the whereabouts of their stash: a photo of some strangely familiar mountains. Whomever it was, Kyle and Dan vow to find them and make them pay. So they begin a journey filled with assumption, deception and consumption. Locating the missing weed, however, is complicated by the fact that Kyle and Dan have completely burned out their short-term memories. What is said or done right now is of little consequence, because in a few minutes they won't remember a damn thing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/43fT7veAysGEOHKpQ94TPz2apmh.jpg", "actors": ["Jeff Kosloski (Kyle)", "Lisa Rosenhagen (Patty)", "Kirk Edward Anderson (Pizza Guy)", "Michael O'Shea (Dan)", "Dave Shirley (Landlord)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
