Griffin Chase has created a script with such social commentary that it is hard not to appreciate the work that he has done on this almost minute short. This is a film that will stick with me for such a long time because of it's overall message. It works as a short and should stay that way because it is a masterpiece through and through. I especially liked how the audio fits the theme. But the only nit pick that I have is that the camera just couldn't stay still but that really doesn't effect the film at all because of it's beauty. Aesthetic is a film that should be that should be viewed by everyone. I see a lot more to come that is masterful by Griffin Chased in the long run. Good work and I expect more to come from this young Kubrick named Griffin Chase."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
