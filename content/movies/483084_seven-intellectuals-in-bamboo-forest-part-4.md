Ruan Ji, Ji Kang, Shan Tao, Liu Ling, Ruan Yan, Xiang Xiu and Wang Rong were famous poets and artists at that time. Open and unruly, they used to gather and drink in the bamboo forest, singing songs and playing traditional Chinese musical instruments, in the hope of escaping from earthly life. They pursued individuality, freedom, and liberty. Their remarkable talent and passion made them a notable group in Chinese history. Part 4 is about the idea of living on an island with no one else, avoiding the hustle and bustle of the busy metropolis. In Chinese legend, there is an island of Peach Blossoms - the very ideal place to live, where one's thoughts can fly freely.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Chen Ran ()", "Kong Chenjiang ()", "Yanqin Gao ()", "Huang Lu ()", "Jing Xu ()", "Li Shenghua ()", "Dai Zhe ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
