A series of flickering compositions explore the cycles inherent in all scales of biological matter, ranging from flora and fauna to terrestrial topographies. The geometric, yet nebulous forms reflect the dichotomy between the imposed order and erratic flux of nature.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vjVn6xhkbJi3OJ53mPRu3tIvUKa.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
