In its essence, LARP is an extension of how you experienced games as a child. When tabletop games grew too big for the board, players put down their dice, picked up their swords, and have been playing make-believe ever since. The culmination of years-old conversations in a local pub, Treasure Trapped is part-documentary, part-road movie; a film that charts the journey of Mike, Al and Nick, as they explore this often misunderstood pastime. Casting a unique look over a worldwide community that is known for its eccentricities, this project aspires to bring the hobby to the masses. Game on!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jcsht8AUcxwwb8URjqI9AkvfbZZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
