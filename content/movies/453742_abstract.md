The work links cinematic shooting and military warfare together, implicating Germany\u2019s role in the operation. This has been screened in the past as a dual-channel work. But in this case it has been re-purposed by the artist as a split screen film. (KG)  From e-flux:\r Abstract presents a scenario in which the violence of warfare and the violence of aesthetics twist around each other. The two-channel video visits the site where Steyerl\u2019s friend Andrea Wolf was killed in 1998, but through a prism that refracts cinematic language against the weapons that killed her friend. As the site and circumstances of her death fold into the act of witnessing it from a distance, the ethical burden of identifying those responsible also appears to live and die with the debris that still remains at the site of the helicopter attack.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fhzmFn85Jz2ZPzj3Nz33VSsozF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
