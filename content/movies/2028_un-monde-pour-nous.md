This movie is special in the sense that it was made way back in '89 and still holds the same relevance...because **LOVE is TIMELESS**...\r\n\r\nDo not miss it if you wanna feel what love is in the truest sense of the word... _\"I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen\"_ - it kills me but if you hold on, you'd find out that she gave the pen because she couldn't give him his love filled heart back !!\r\n\r\nA great and successful effort on the director's part to not try and make something special out of this movie because in the end that's what really makes it so special..A _10/10_ for sure...one of the best movies about LOVE !!"}], "recommandations_id": [13667, 8992, 9434, 11522], "youtube_key": "QeUnT3f7eAA"}
