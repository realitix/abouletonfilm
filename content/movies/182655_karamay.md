The students were performing for state officials and were told to stand by while the officials exited first. After the fire, the story was heavily censored in the Chinese state media. To this day, the families of Karamay have not been allowed to publicly mourn their children.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wX33Xgaos3glfI80PbKxcjQv1Mx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
