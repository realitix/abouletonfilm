Performing covers are members of Osso, Phosphorescent and Vanishing Voice. The result is an innovative \"home movie\" shot by Brooklyn photographer and sometime-Castanets member Mia Ferm that breathes new life into the music and lyrics of front man Ray Raposa and the group.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
