City Lights would not be a talking picture, but it would have a soundtrack. Chaplin personally composed a musical score and sound effects for the picture. With Peter Lord, the famous co-creator of Chicken Run and Wallace &amp; Gromit, we see how Chaplin became the king of slapstick comedy and the superstar of the movies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1g392WgDkf3DVMgNwYHXtGhL8LF.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Lord (Himself)", "Charlie Chaplin ((archive footage))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [251971, 197240, 197241, 191091], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
