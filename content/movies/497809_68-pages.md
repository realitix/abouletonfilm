Through 68 Pages of a counselors diary, we see the stories of Paayal, a sex worker; Nishit, an ID user; Kiran, a gay man and Umrao, a transsexual bar dancer - their stories of pain and fear, humiliation and rejection - not only by the society, but even by their loved ones.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vBkWdbMYyahMe7CZ0RT5cI4PjPC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "wgPAG7y4RIQ"}
