He sets off to find his voice and meets all kinds of creatures who make all kinds of noises, but still he can make no sound at all. One day he meets a special friend, another cricket and this time, when he rubs his wings together, he makes \"the most beautiful sound you have ever heard.\" The sound, produced by a hidden chip, reinforces the joyful conclusion to the cricket's dilemma.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
