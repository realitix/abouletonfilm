Well, we\u2019re just dreaming, but a boy named Tolya Ryzhkov did find one, though, between us, he didn\u2019t deserve such a good fortune. He was a pretty big liar and rascal, didn\u2019t listen to his mother, hurt those who were weaker, and didn\u2019t obey traffic regulations.On that ill-fated day when his incredible adventures began he behaved badly, as usual. He had even made a policeman mad! While running away from him, Tolya met a magician and forced a box of magic matches from him. To punish the boy, the evil magician (alas, there are such, too) had Tolya transported to his magic island. You will know how it all ended when you watch this humorous, fascinating adventure film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1PhgLlKEzFTIMY00WjaUSiaYHL2.jpg", "actors": ["Alisa Freyndlikh (Mother)", "Oleg Tabakov (Father)", "Savely Kramarov (Pigeon)", "Georgi Svetlani ()", "Yuri Uspensky (Robot)", "Evaldas Mikali\u016bnas (Tolik)", "Andrey Kharybin (Mishka)", "Dmitri Yuzovsky (Mitka (as Mitya Yuzovsky))", "Sergei Yevsyunin (Wizard)", "Vladimir Brezhnev (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [265235, 473224, 303175, 109991], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
