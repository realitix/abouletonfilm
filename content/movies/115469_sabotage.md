Napoleon Bonaparte, surrounded by enemies, is about to play his definitive part in history. He has spent his whole life creating a mystique, becoming synonymous with determination, strength and mystery. But, that whole super-leader trip is smothering him and he just can't stand it anymore. Meanwhile, one of his aides, le mar\u00e9chal Hugo Armani, has only one dream: to emulate the man who is his idol, his emperor. Armani picks the battle of Waterloo as the moment for his borderline psychotic attack - the first case of Napoleonic delirium in modern psychiatry. Due to the shortage of mar\u00e9chals at the moment, Napoleon's got no choice: he has to leave Armani in command. Unbalanced Armani, so unexpectedly promoted, now leads the troops of France.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9izjMwocqrosgnLZuskYYuRuiY5.jpg", "actors": ["David Suchet (Napole\u00f3n)", "Stephen Fry (Wellington)", "Dominique Pinon (Armani)", "Alexandra Vandernoot (Capt.
