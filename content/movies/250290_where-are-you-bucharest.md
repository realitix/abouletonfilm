They've all met on the streets of Bucharest, 23 years after the Romanian Revolution, determined to reclaim the public space. Vlad Petri is following their stories for one year, from the first days of the anti-government protests to the final days of the Referendum against the President. The film raises questions about the role of the public space, the power of the individual and the understanding of democracy in a society caught between a communist past and an uncertain future.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sxEp2PsLuF8r9pN5n4DS8BBRroJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "nodM_coc-y8"}
