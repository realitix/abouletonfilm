PART ONE describes Steiner\u2019s childhood as the son of a humble railway official, growing up in the Austrian countryside, and his student years in Vienna towards the end of the 19th century. Hugely influenced by Goethe\u2019s scientific writings, he was gradually able to reconcile the powerful spiritual experiences he had had since childhood with his interest in science and philosophy.  PART TWO looks initially at the subject of reincarnation and karma, with film at a prison in South Wales, at Ruskin Mill in Gloucestershire \u2013 a college for disadvantaged youngsters.  In the USA there are scenes at a biodynamic winery in California. Also featured are examples of Waldorf educational ideas being introduced into mainstream schooling.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dMhCqW2TRfexKSrIfty2t0A3NhM.jpg", "actors": ["Rudolf Steiner (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "jmrQ75xaFck"}
