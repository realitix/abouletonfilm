But in reality, he's broke, living out of his van, $93,000 in debt and still looking for the ever-elusive purpose of his life. Pop, an elderly friend from the past, offers Victor his only choice - to come back home. Through the story's inspiring ending of reconciled relationships and realized dreams, we are reminded that no life is \"common\" - and that everyone has a God-given purpose.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/43QWQtD7yQtlfMfa1SgNcPsOKqJ.jpg", "actors": ["Jeremy Marr Williams (Victor Clay)", "Melissa Lozoff (Jeana Clay)", "Abbey Kochman (Shay Clay)", "Susan Loraine Anderson (Hope Stevens)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
