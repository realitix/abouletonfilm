It is one of the few operettas that are regularly performed at the major opera houses such as the Metropolitan Opera, the Scala Milan, the Vienna State Opera and the Royal Opera House Convent Garden in London. John Cox directed this lavishly equipped production by Julia Trevelyan Oman initially in London in 1977. On New Year's Eve 1990, this staging offered the luxurious ambiance for the farewell to Joan Sutherland from her London audience. The singer had admired them since her first great success at this prestigious opera house in the fifties. The rushing feast in the second act reached its climax with its stormy cheered performance and the commitment of her friends and colleagues Luciano Pavarotti and Marilyn Horne, with whom she often stood together on the stage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3klEctJuxaL0fzpqzGnTmnLy5HZ.jpg", "actors": ["Nancy Gustafson ()", "Judith Howarth ()", "Joan Sutherland ()", "Luciano Pavarotti ()", "Marilyn Horne ()", "Louis Otey ()", "Bonaventura Bottone ()", "Anthony Michaels-Moore ()", "Eric Garrett ()", "John Dobson ()", "Richard Bonynge (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
