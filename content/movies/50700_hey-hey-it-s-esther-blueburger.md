Esther Blueburger's quest begins when she escapes from her Bat Mitzvah party and is befriended by Sunni.., the effortlessly cool girl who is everything Esther thinks she wants to be. With the help of Sunni, Esther goes away from her ordinary life and leaves behind her malfunctioning Jewish family to hang out with Sunni's far breezier and super-hip single mom Mary and attend Sunni's forbidden public school as a Swedish exchange student.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kqgvF7q2Xh8w1wc9qikPJroBi5g.jpg", "actors": ["Danielle Catanzariti (Esther Blueburger)", "Keisha Castle-Hughes (Sunni)", "Toni Collette (Mary)", "Christian Byers (Jacob Blueburger)", "Essie Davis (Grace Blueburger)", "Russell Dykstra (Osmond Blueburger)", "Jonny Pasvolsky (Mr. Hooper)", "Cassandra Jinman (The Slug)", "Yen Yen Stender (Ribbon 2 / Lissy)", "Talia Monaghan (Ribbon 1 / Missy)", "Laura Kettle (Ribbon 3 / Demi)", "Lucy Carey (Ribbon 4 / Sienna)", "Tisha Adey (Ribbon 5 / Prudence)", "Leticia Monaghan (Prefect / Cynthia)", "Edwin Hodgeman (Rabbi)", "Russell Dykstra (Music Teacher)", "Vanessa Downing (Music Teacher)", "Poh Ling Yeow (Sales Assistant)", "Bridget Walters (Mrs Rosen)", "Esme Proudman (Mrs. Silverman)", "Deidre Rubenstein (Mrs. Fleisher)", "Tony Mack (Science Teacher)", "Caitlin McDougall (Miss Koolkats)", "Elise Champion (Helen)", "Nikita Adams (Piper)", "Daniela Ganter (Alex)", "Alex DeGaris-Boot (Braces Boy)", "Mark Gaweda (Psychiatrist)", "Paul Blackwell (Mr. Duke)", "Lyn Pike (Sunii's Grandmother)", "Patrick Frost (Sunni's Grandfather)", "Joey Kennedy (Policewoman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [46899, 72987, 38051, 13065], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
