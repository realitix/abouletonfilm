Adam Miauczynski, the character known from director Marek Koterski's previous films, is a 44 year-old teacher, who reads poetry during school lessons and later goes home swearing and calling his neighbours' names. The worst pain for him is the next 5 minutes of living. He doesn't accept himself and even everyday contacts with others cause his aggression. Though constantly dreaming of a romantic love, he is not bold enough to make his dreams come true. The desperate Miauczynski personalizes our own fears and obsessions, which have become so visible recently.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8uZJfotM7yqEYRVl62L3Rext8qz.jpg", "actors": ["Marek Kondrat (Adam Miauczy\u0144ski)", "Andrzej Grabowski (S\u0105siad)", "Piotr Machalica (Psychoanalityk)", "Zbigniew Buczkowski (Dozorca \"gol\u0105cy\" trawnik pod oknem)", "Micha\u0142 Koterski (Sylwu\u015b, syn Adasia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [8211, 31132, 79221, 38371], "youtube_key": "mAgCcQNNAms"}
