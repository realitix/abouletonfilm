Displaying the uniquely heroic quality of his voice, Domingo heads a superb cast, including Sara Mingardo, Monica Bacelli, and Ingela Bohlin, all magnificently responsive to Paul McCreesh's authentic and luminous musical interpretation of the score. The stunning theatrical staging by Graham Vick provides a splendid setting for the characters and for designer Richard Hudson's extravagant Baroque-Islamic costumes, emphasizing the brilliance of one of Handel's finest dramatic achievements. -  Monica Bacelli, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Ingela Bohlin", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g9VMHqlFtTAGX3oETdRIqB0auEV.jpg", "actors": ["Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (Bajazet)", "Monica Bacelli (Tamerlano)", "Ingela Bohlin (Asteria)", "Sara Mingardo (Andronico)", "Jennifer Holloway (Irene)", "Luigi De Donato (Leone)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
