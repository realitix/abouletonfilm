Political intrigue abounds in a complex upside-down world as militia assassin Mike Wilson unexpectedly decides to renounce the violence his assignment demands, and Homeland Security official Cynthia Porter purposely sabotages a government spying operation she helped create. Consequently, Mike and Cynthia must pay the price for betraying the organizations they had once faithfully served.  Labeled a terrorist by the very people she used to work with, Cynthia faces a personal and professional crisis. Wilson is gunned down by a comrade-in-arms, although his new-found pacifism is passed onto fellow militia member Sam Norton. Now Norton is faced with foiling a terrorist plot to bomb Porters office and rescue her from zealous government agents.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xQUo0j7RpDUq70kmO1FGfpZGpsw.jpg", "actors": ["Penny Perkins (Cynthia Porter)", "Kevin Craig West (Eric Walker)", "Yvonne Perry (Patricia Porter)", "Tony Grocki (Sam Norton)", "Mark Musto (Bill Sutton)", "Jennifer Roth (Lt.
