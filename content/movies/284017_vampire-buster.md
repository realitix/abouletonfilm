Centuries later, during the cultural revolution, rebels attempted to gain possession of the vessel from the priest's descendant; however, he threw it into the ocean to keep it from being tampered. The vase was recovered years later in Hong Kong and was auctioned off to a councilman. The demon, unfortunately, escaped and took control of the councilman's body, beginning a spree of terror in the city.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/noBzR46AAxAIpYM3J6Rtj3Uqe8H.jpg", "actors": ["Kent Cheng (Cheung Sap Yat)", "Stanley Fung (Councillor Steven Kay)", "Pak-Cheung Chan (Chan Pak Tung)", "Jacky Cheung (Jacky)", "Elsie Chan (Cat)", "Anglie Leung Wan-Yui (Mabel)", "Frankie Chan Fan-Kei (Micky)", "Manfred Wong (Bo)", "Hung Mei (Steven's Mother)", "Chung Fat (Demon from the Vase)", "Helena Law Lan (Councillor Tang)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
