Days later, he finds Lara (Sofia Lee) unconscious in a hidden cove. When she regains consciousness, they both realize that they only have each other to survive this ordeal. They subsist by fishing from the bounty of the sea and gradually learn about each other. Edgar's girl friend doesn't approve of his precarious employment and wants him to leave his job. This puts strain to their sketchy relationship. Lara, on the other hand, dances in a bar and sees this mishap as a way to redemption - out of the seedy grind of her job.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hOzLOf2oPlgvTvkWcYthTJ6O3lX.jpg", "actors": ["Sofia Lee (Lara)", "Ian Ileto (Edgar)", "Sofia Valdez (Amy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
