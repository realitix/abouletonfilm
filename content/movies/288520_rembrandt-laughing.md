Very obliquely Rembrandt Laughing sketches the time and place, encompassing the AIDS epidemic, the casual sexual revolution, the debris of '68 lingering in the air. A quiet, very San Francisco comedy of life among a small group of friends. Rembrandt Laughing was improvised over the period of about a month by Jost and his friends, mostly acting non-professionals.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fmdxsOfgST51TJHkKBiM6k2zB4A.jpg", "actors": ["Nathaniel Dorsky ()", "Jerry Barrish ()", "Kate Dezina ()", "Barbara Hammes ()", "Roger Ruffin ()", "Jon A.
