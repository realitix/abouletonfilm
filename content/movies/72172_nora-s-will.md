The rabbi explains Joseph that due to the celebrations this time of the year, if Nora is not buried that same day, they should wait at least 5 days for the funeral. Nora had planned before his death, a Machiavellian plan in order that Joseph was the one who has to take care of his funeral. But Nora forgot a small detail, a mysterious photograph stored under her bed, that will remind Joseph that the greatest love stories, sometimes are hidden in the smallest places.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lGh3OTYHd74RILwuY2LcNezwJUT.jpg", "actors": ["Fernando Luj\u00e1n (Jos\u00e9 Kurtz)", "Enrique Arreola (Mois\u00e9s)", "Ari Brickman (Rub\u00e9n Kurtz)", "Juan Carlos Colombo (Dr. Alberto Nurko)", "Silvia Mariscal (Nora Kurtz)", "Marina de Tavira (Young Nora Kurtz)", "Cecilia Su\u00e1rez (B\u00e1rbara Kurtz)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "DBxSBH2ELjI"}
