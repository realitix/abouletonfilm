At this point, Filfil enlists the services of a witch, Umm ul-Hiba, who transforms Filfila into a chimpanzee, while supplying Filfil with an antidote to her magic, which will return Filfila to her normal self. Although this initially proves successful, the witch is soon afterwards found dead --- and with her death, Filfila turns back into a chimp! The rest of the movie consists of Filfil and Filfila's quest to restore her human form, comprising visits to conjurers, soothsayers, alchemists, and others.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Melvina Amine ()", "Said Elmaghrabi ()", "Ursula Franke ()", "Shafiq Hassan ()", "\u0625\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0645 \u062e\u0627\u0646 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
