Just after securing the account for the upcoming season for the Chicago Cubs, Ted is passed over for a big promotion that would have supplied the finances for Ted and his pro-bono working, civil-rights lawyer, husband, Jack, to purchase their dream home. To make matters worse, he was passed over for his arch-nemesis, only five years his junior, but well more fine-tuned in the arts of social media. Ted gradually loses his sanity and finds himself slowly cutting himself off from society, thanks to a chance meeting with a low-tech hippie named Norm. As Ted\u2019s husband worries for him and Ted\u2019s friends go along for the ride, Ted must experience the pro\u2019s and con\u2019s of modern technology before finding a way to win his promotion back and get their dream home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bXNtTUjlzfSFzBUlUrYGG0hRyMG.jpg", "actors": ["Louis Lombardi (Chaz)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
