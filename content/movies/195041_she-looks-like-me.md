After a viewing session leads to a horny banging, they come across a hardcore video that features their friend, Carrie as porn star Riley Steele. When confronted, Carrie denies she would be the popular hardcore adult actress, but that does not stop Selena from spreading the gossip. While her friends debate whether Carrie looks like the girl fucking on screen, she pleases her boyfriend Ramon Nomar with her pornstar-like moves. April O'Neil gets so over heated watching the naughty movies that she invites Marcus London to sample her dripping wet pussy. When confronted with the online video evidence, Ramon reacts by dumping the blonde beauty. Carrie's friend Maddy and her guy Mick Blue also get turned on watching the erotic videos and decide to indulge with some pornographic playtime of their own. Now single, Carrie hooks up with Marcus, who may be in for a surprise.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cI3R7EkcKpOB542rVo06RNALg79.jpg", "actors": ["Selena Rose ()", "Riley Steele ()", "April O'Neil ()", "Maddy O'Reilly ()", "Marco Banderas ()", "Ramon Nomar ()", "Marcus London ()", "Mick Blue ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
