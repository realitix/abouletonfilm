It was produced in an unlimited edition and is intended to be shown on a domestic-style monitor, although it may also be displayed as a projection with special permission from the artist. The video depicts the artist, an attractive young woman dancing manically around the room while repeatedly singing \u2018I\u2019m not the girl who misses much\u2019. The phrase is an adaptation of the first line of the Beatles song \u2018Happiness is a Warm Gun'. Referring to her childhood Rist has said, \u2018In my village in Switzerland I had a small window on the art world through the mass media; through John Lennon/Yoko Ono I moved from pop music to contemporary art. In return, I will always be grateful to popular culture\u2019 (quoted in \u2018I rist, you rist, she rists, he rists, we rist, you rist, they rist, tourist: Hans Ulrich Obrist in Conversation with Pipilotti Rist\u2019, Pipilotti Rist, p.16).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lzSLni4L2vb0HHdoC2NN4fObljq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
