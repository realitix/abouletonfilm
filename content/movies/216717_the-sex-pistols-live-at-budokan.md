John Lydon returns as Johnny Rotten, with two-tone hair, red shorts, and no letup from the famous raw, shouted vocals with which he helped invent UK punk in the 1970\u2019s. Steve Jones, Glen Matlock and Paul Cook blast out the music in the Pistols\u2019 trademark fast, tight, loud style, reviving a host of Sex Pistols favourites.  While the great punk-rock moment that the Sex Pistols created and owned in the mid-1970\u2019s was brief and fleeting, this concert shows that punk rock \u2013 and the band that made it famous \u2013 will never die. A searing evening of wild music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lEMl6TlMbkd5lAnvgg0S0fygRR5.jpg", "actors": ["John Lydon (Johnny Rotton (Himself))", "Sid Vicious (Himself)", "Steve Jones (Himself)", "Paul Cook (Himself)", "Glen Matlock (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "tIeKhqScMOE"}
