During the summer months, the horses live a wild existence, grazing in the highlands and raising their young. Each fall, they are rounded up by local farmers and directed across the stunning landscape. The horse holds a precious place in Icelandic culture, art and tradition; for over 1,000 years Icelandic law has prohibited the importation of horses onto the island.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mHMtZLvJvIDQSLddxXaCP7feGm5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
