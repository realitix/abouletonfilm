This Robin-hood-esque figure would steal primarily livestock from the white settler farmers, terrorizing them for over a decade. Led by the hardliner General Botha, a mammoth manhunt ensues in the very mountain where Kepe was rumored to occupy a Noah's Ark like cave. This spectacle ingratiated Kepe in the hearts of the marginalized indigenous-population who turn Kepe's miscreant deeds into the stuff of legend making him a threat to the very fabric of the colonial society. Sew the Winter to my Skin is a thrilling, operatic ride into the heart of Pre-Apartheid South Africa and is a visceral exploration of the effects of the colonial displacement that sewed the seeds for one of the most viciously racist, political regimes in history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ncppYYRjTbdxvL2867fsgsNRKnK.jpg", "actors": ["Ezra Mabengeza (Runner)", "Peter Kurth (Botha)", "Kandyse McClure (Golden Eyes)", "David James (Frontiersman)", "Dave Walpole (The Scarfaced Kid)", "Antoinette Louw (Mrs. Botha)", "Bok van Blerk (Simon)", "Bongile Mantsai (Fearless the Rabble Rouser)", "Brenda Ngxoli (Mole)", "Zolisa Xaluva (Black Wyatt Earp)", "Nomhl\u00e9 Nkyonyeni (Old Matriarch)", "Carlo Radebe (Rider)", "Mandisa Nduna (Birthmark)", "Gabriel Fredericks (Dead Man Walking)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
