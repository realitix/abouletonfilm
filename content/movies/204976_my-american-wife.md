The story opens in Smelter City, Arizona, where the richest man in town is grizzled old Indian fighter Lafe Cantillon (Fred Stone). Lafe's social-climbing sister-in-law (Billie Burke) insists that her daughter Mary wed a titled European, Count Ferdinand (Francis Lederer). Much to Lafe's delight, Mary isn't assimilated into Continental high society; instead, she instructs Count Ferdinand in the virtues of good, old-fashioned American democracy. And, of, course, the Count and Lafe become great chums when the \"furriner\" proves that he can ride a bucking bronco with the best of 'em.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lJV1oT9jF2mmICI3mQx4bpMK0Td.jpg", "actors": ["Francis Lederer (Count Ferdinand von und zu Reidenach)", "Ann Sothern (Mary Cantillon)", "Fred Stone (Lafe Cantillon)", "Billie Burke (Mrs. Robert Cantillon)", "Ernest Cossart (Adolphe)", "Grant Mitchell (Robert Cantillon)", "Hal K.
