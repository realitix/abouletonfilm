Treacherous crime syndicates collide in a psychic, ballistic, paranormal, nuclear battle for an ancient Chinese coin that holds the blood rights to Hong Kong. Red-headed bad*ss Lens is called upon to retrieve the magical coin before the back-stabbing, double-crossing, two-timing, generally seedy events that follow get him killed...again.  With a loving tip of the hat to John Woo, Sam Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy, and the cyber-punk chaos of Shinya Tsukamoto's Tetsuo The Iron Man, director Steinauer unleashes the first cult masterpiece of the milennium.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5XDNEFBGy3cwrytDCAl5O6fr8hN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
