Now Delancourt (Bernard Giraudeau) is apparently living a good life managing a gym in a Paris hotel under Nazi control, where he meets his former friend Pierre (Christophe Malavoy), who is on a secret assignment to mislead the Nazis on the date of the Normandie invasion. Pierre, alias Augustin, cannot figure out if Delancourt is a real resistance fighter or if he is a double agent. Circumstances create a larger and larger gap between the former friends while the plot goes through several twists and turns before Pierre's doubts are resolved.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vcsv8yktS29u8wkBF3DtVk6jNDg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
