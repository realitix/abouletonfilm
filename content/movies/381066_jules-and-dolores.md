The most coveted trophy of all time, the Jules Rimet Cup disappeared from the headquarters of CBF, the Brazilian Football Association. Let me explain: every 4 years FIFA holds a Football World Cup. Back then, only a country that won the Cup three times could keep the trophy for good. This privilege was reserved to Brazil when they won for the 3rd time in 1970. The beautiful trophy was kept as a symbol of superiority in the headquarters of CBF, in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cJules and Dolores\u201d is a pop comedy that tell us the real, preposterous and unusual story behind this theft.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jTpawXfV72mMfJYpIgJt4Yd9GZQ.jpg", "actors": ["Paulo Tiefenthaler (Peralta)", "Danilo Grangheia (Borracha)", "Ta\u00eds Ara\u00fajo (Dolores)", "Mr. Catra (Albino)", "Milhem Cortaz (Cortez)", "Thelmo Fernandes (Luiz Gustavo)", "Leandro Firmino (Cec\u00edlio)", "Otto Jr. (Moacir)", "Fabio Marcoff (Diego Armando Garc\u00eda)", "Stepan Nercessian (Presidente da CBF)", "Hamilton Vaz Pereira (Bispo)", "Pedro Wagner (Geraldinho)", "Charles Paraventi (Os\u00f3rio)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [391754, 488446, 451329, 485608], "youtube_key": "Qji3IfDCTHg"}
