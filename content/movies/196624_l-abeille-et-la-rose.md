The film runs just a few seconds short of four minutes as several women are dressed up as bees dancing around their hive. The \"Queen Bee\" goes to take a nap and she's attacked by a spider. The spider sequence is what gets this film a mention by fantasy fans but sadly this scene takes place around the 3:13 mark and lasts just a few seconds.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [116363], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
