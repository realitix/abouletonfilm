Songs About Jane finally entered the Billboard Top Ten in August 2004, more than two years after the album's release, and follow-up singles like \"She Will Be Loved\" and \"Sunday Morning\" helped the album move over 2.7 million copies by year's end.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/toX9gf0iCagBQDrCkVFtn9cEnQs.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ti8ZkqlFpVA"}
