Life is very difficult to a family of a pilot who spent 14 years in prison on the basis of false testimony. Her husband's prosecution is his wife's fate, while his daughter doesn't even know that her father is alive. After many migrations and wanderings, the mother meets a soft-spoken yet unscrupulous man who'll promise her marriage, and rape her daughter. The mother eventually ends up at asylum, and the father returns from prison at the right time to help their daughter in life which crucial lessons she already mastered.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dhpRzV9UuYNuhjSQGK0Jz1XTuNU.jpg", "actors": ["Mirjana Jokovi\u0107 (Milica)", "Mirjana Karanovi\u0107 (Bo\u017eidarka)", "Danilo Lazovi\u0107 (Miodrag)", "Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107 (Mi\u0161a)", "\u200bLjubi\u0161a Samard\u017ei\u0107 (\u017dika Ajkula)", "Dragan Maksimovi\u0107 (Kosta)", "Maja Sablji\u0107 (Slavica)", "Borivoje Todorovi\u0107 (Stojan)", "Renata Ulmanski (Vida)", "Predrag Lakovi\u0107 (Bora)", "Predrag Ejdus (Direktor)", "Goran Sultanovi\u0107 (Kostin drug)", "Ivan Bekjarev (Inspektor)", "Dragoljub Milosavljevi\u0107 'Gula' (Starac)", "Katica \u017deli (Bo\u017eidarkina koleginica)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
