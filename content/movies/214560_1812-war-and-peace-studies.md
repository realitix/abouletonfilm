The work uses only and exclusively found footage and material from the film, and implodes it to create a new audiovisual work, a new visual sound experience. The result is an experimental vision that pretends to expand the way we perceive films and tries to push our notion of audiovisual sensations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sSI2Kdfis0Lm70m5lxdDlt1MJvX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
