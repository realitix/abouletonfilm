Unbeknownst to them, the village idiot Igor (Kari V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen), who aspires to be one of them, has arrived in the United States too in pursuit, and their manager Vladimir (played by the late, great Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4) exploited them all the way by taking their earnings for his own luxurious desires. <i>Leningrad Cowboys Meet Moses</i> follows closely on the action of the first film, as Vladimir reappears after an unexplained absence, having become an extravagantly bearded religious fanatic and calling himself Moses. Their former manager wants to lead the band, who have become stranded in Mexico, back to their home in Siberia. This sequel has the same general format as its predecessor, though this time the road trip is from France back through Europe to the Russian border. Vladimir has stolen something important, and French actor Andr\u00e9 Wilms plays an American CIA agent pursuing him on the road back home (his thick French accent again clashing with his character's supposed origin).\r\n\r\n<i>Leningrad Cowboys Meet Moses</i> is among Kaurism\u00e4ki's worst films, and one of those sequels that should have never been made. Already with the first film one was just as likely to sigh at the lameness of it all as chuckle at the gags. The sequel, however, is a much more somber film than its predecessor, which mean there are even less gags, and virtually every scene feels like milking a formula. While it might be worth a try if you are a committed fan of Kaurism\u00e4ki's body of work, I would be very reluctant to recommend this (or even the vastly superior LENINGRAD COWBOYS GO America) to a general audience."}], "recommandations_id": [250278, 43396, 67451, 109485], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
