This three-part observational series continues to explore one of the most extreme urban environments on the planet, by taking a trip into the lives of those who choose to live and work on the waters of Lagos Lagoon. Chubbey is a fisherman who lives in a house built on stilts. With 18 children and five grandchildren to support, he has become an expert at making money from the most unlikely of places. Whether he is building a fish pond in the same water he uses as a lavatory, or renting out a spare room which he has not even built yet, he has always got some scheme or another on the go. But when his teenage son starts to hang out with a local gang, he is left with a dilemma familiar to parents all over the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/HMzmQTsoCkdybLpnnrcxvbujSf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
