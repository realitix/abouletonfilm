With a flair for anecdotes and situations, big politics and the small folks along the side of the road, Gerd Kroske has filmed a documentary, which refers back to the educational films of the transit police and footage of surveillance cameras of the state security and shows much more than a piece of \u201ccivil engineering\u201d history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z6VlXVaEhov9sDnfluP3RxK0zVO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
