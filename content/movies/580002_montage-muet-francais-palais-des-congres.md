It definitely goes chronologically through French cinema, definitely avoids a general historiography and obvious citations, and definitely gravitates towards films shot in Paris, yet none of these touchpoints elucidate exactly what Langlois\u2019s epic essay film was intended for. It was found in the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que on the shelves only recently and digitized, embalming what feels like a very specific and quite personal guided tour through cinema, with the guide (Langlois) missing.\" - Daniel Kasman, MUBI", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/um1EA7yzUj7C42iMU0JihHCKjYq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
