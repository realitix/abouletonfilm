We are taken through a demonstration by Lotte herself on the way she cut out, constructed and filmed a silhouette character. She also discusses how she developed the use of coloured gelatines for her backgrounds. To illustrate her output, the documentary includes extracts from several of her films including Papageno (1935), The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926) and The Frog Prince.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Lotte Reiniger (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
