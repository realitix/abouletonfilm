Keep everything else the same, but change is sexuality and you have (in my opinion) a much more enjoyable film. Obviously, that is not the case, so instead my takeaway from _Get the Girl_ is two simple facts, the first was some new information, and the second was just confirming something I already knew:\r\n\r\n1) There is a person on this Earth by the name of Jerry Purpdrank, and\r\n2) Adi Shankar is a weird fuckin' dude.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}], "recommandations_id": [292108, 348754, 204607, 316268]}
