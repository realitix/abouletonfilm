Following a failed audition for the National Youth Orchestra, Pablo encounters another musician, Salome who doesn't believe he is really gay and takes him to a psychiatrist to prove it. Pablo's domineering mother, a laundress who affects a vast musical knowledge, wants him to reunite with his former lover, but this does not stop her son from secretly wishing he could be with Salome who in the meantime, falls in love with Pablo's father, a music teacher, who has quietly used his influence to sneak his son into the orchestra after all. Mayhem ensues as Pablo simultaneously deals with his sexual ambivalence and a gentle rivalry for first chair in the horn section.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aS9XpQ7vWPMJX9W6jDiHJRaOoUK.jpg", "actors": ["Pen\u00e9lope Cruz ()", "\u00d3scar Ladoire ()", "Rosa Maria Sard\u00e0 ()", "Jordi Moll\u00e0 ()", "Pere Ponce ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
