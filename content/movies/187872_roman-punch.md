The primary distinctions seem to be that the background art indicates random classical ruins and the sight gags are a little more grotesque -- \"Santa Lucia\" is performed with a squeaky voice and one mouse doffs his ears and the top of his head to a female mouse.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
