The river and salmon have weathered decades of over-fishing, abusive logging, catastrophic floods, droughts and a hydro power dam that diverts water out of basin. Today the Eel\u2019s recovering wild salmon compete for water with the region\u2019s multi-billion dollar underground cannabis economy and the wine industries of Sonoma and Mendocino, California.
