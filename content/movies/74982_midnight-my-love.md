The film has dream sequences that place the characters in scenes that might have come from a classic Thai melodrama film of the 1960s or 70s, with a dubbed soundtrack, which was a common method of filmmaking in the era.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gE67miDL1RfP3KKpzkNgpOKtpnT.jpg", "actors": ["Petchtai Wongkamlao (Sombati Diprom 'Bati' (as Mum Jokmok))", "Woranut Wongsawan (Nual)", "Siwa Traesang (Sia Chan)", "Keunsith Suwanwattakee (Jon)", "Puritat Chaiseth (Toy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [109048, 130023, 116303, 62958], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
