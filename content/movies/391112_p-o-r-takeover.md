They came into this film with one goal; to top their previous \"Uprising\" film. They succeeded with flying colors, but we'll let you be the judge of that. This DVD features all new stunts, broken bones, new members, knock outs, &amp; medical bills. In 2010 P.O.R had over 100 TV appearances, which broke several records in the Homegrown stunt scene. Also for the first time ever the entire crew came together for an entire week to challenge one another head to head, literally. So sit back as P.O.R takes you through an entire year of what they do best.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rhey6islT9hLhUHazKjG1WzqMTo.jpg", "actors": ["JJ Allin (Himself)", "Pussy Ronald (Himself)", "Harley Shifflett (Bass Turd Mania)", "Caleb Gerken (DA Gerk)", "Alec Cox (Himeself)", "Austin McDonald (A-Mac)", "Gary Lawson (Scary Gary)", "Zach Holmes (Himself)", "Justin Shifflett (Himself)", "Josh Davidson (Himself)", "Nolan Santana (Himself)", "Garret Davis (GAYit)", "Addison Newberry (Himself)", "Eric Northrup (Himself)", "Criss Angle (Himself)", "Steph Dunk (Himself)", "Dylan Shifflett (Himself)", "Josh Campbell (Himself)", "Mike Mazur (Himself)", "Mike Gaboff (Crazy Mike)", "Ryan Gaboff (Flyin' Ryan)", "Bobby Pyro (Himself)", "Mike Contee (Money Mike)", "Corey Rodocker (Corey Chronic)", "Mat Shifflett (King Mefesto)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "3u2Zn8ALFV0"}
