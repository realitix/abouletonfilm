Harry (Helmuth) is a simple old-time shop porter offered a chance at self-realisation when he's bequeathed a sum by an unknown relative (via several levels of fiscal blood suckers). He decides to engage a butler to take good care of him for a time. This is a man of distinguished upper class service, but a generous nature which happily integrates with Harry's small but colourful world of drinking buddies and crackpot neighbourhood kids.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i1pbgaAG1903UBlAfZRTgWRMb97.jpg", "actors": ["Osvald Helmuth (Harry Adamsen)", "Ebbe Rode (Butler Fabricius)", "Gunnar Lauring (Biskoppen)", "Lily Broberg (Trine)", "Olaf Ussing (Krause)", "Palle Kirk (Heisenberg)", "Lise Ringheim ()", "Henning Moritzen ()", "Aage F\u00f8nss ()", "Ejner Federspiel ()", "Einar Reim ()", "Ernst Schou ()", "Emil Hallberg ()", "Johannes Krogsgaard ()", "Vals\u00f8 Holm ()", "Kirsten Jacobsen ()", "Hartvig Bendixen ()", "Aage Winther-J\u00f8rgensen ()", "Harry Katlev ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
