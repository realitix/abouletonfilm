He is the creator of more than a hundred works, several of which form part of the repertories of some of the greatest dance centres in the world. Due to the choreographer's extreme reluctance to engage in a documentary, this film is exceptional. For the first time one can have a real close look at Kylian's life, his way of thinking and his most significant creations. The film was shot in Den Haag, Prague, Monte-Carlo and Paris.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
