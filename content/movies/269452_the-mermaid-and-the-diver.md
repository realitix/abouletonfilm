The mermaid had turned his soul into a turtle, and the turtle was the one who returned him to the world of men. Sinbad was born once more as a Miskito and was raised on the banks of the wonderful Coco River. When he grew up, nature took care of carrying him back to the sea, where the mermaid is waiting for him. The Mermaid and the Diver is a journey to Central America, to Nicaragua, to the Atlantic Coast, and to the Miskito people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8QvoTj9dRGKY7hwwSN0jIaFbf8a.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
