She pulls a gun and asks for money. \"Quick, quick, quick!\" The cashier looks anxious and hands over the money. But just when she turns around to walk away, the cashier pulls a shotgun and fires. Is it for real? Apparently not, because someone shouts: Stop! and we suddenly find ourselves on a film set. The director seems to disagree however with the decision to stop shooting. She reflects on the situation. Then, just few moments later, the director is lying in bed. Was the film set real? Was it fiction?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/swlE0EozRm4Zb7U4pYbzI5DYxAo.jpg", "actors": ["Lore Dijkman ()", "Rifka Lodeizen ()", "Casper Gimbr\u00e8re ()", "Helmert Woudenberg ()", "Tamar van den Dop ()", "Freerk Bos ()", "Caroline van Houten ()", "Rob van der Meer ()", "Chris Redmeijer ()", "Ineke Veenhoven ()", "Dani\u00eblle van Duuren ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
