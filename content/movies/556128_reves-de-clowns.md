The men question their popularity and fear that have lost their talent. As they rest backstage, they have a dream: they perform the wildest tricks, the funniest acts, but that same woman is always there and keeps a serious face. As someone wakes them up to go back on stage, they still try to entertain the girl when a famous aviator, back from a dangerous mission appears to the acclaim of the audience and the relief of the young girl who was only anxious for him all along. The brothers, reassured that they were not the cause of her seriousness and proud that they have a hero among the public, gladly go on wit their act.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
