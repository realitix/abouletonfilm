None of the characters have been given names and are therefore referred to only by description. The city is an expressionistic nightmare, a dangerous and chaotic place.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xHxFfemblQqo6yitl675YNEei1t.jpg", "actors": ["Anton Edthofer (The pimp)", "Aud Egede Nissen (Dirne)", "Leonhard Haskel (Herr aus der Provinz)", "Lucie H\u00f6flich (Frau)", "Max Schreck (The blind man)", "Eugen Kl\u00f6pfer ()", "Etelka Maquita (Street girl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [128409, 168179, 79240, 115596], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
