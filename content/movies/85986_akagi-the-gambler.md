Even unfamiliar with the rules of Mahjong, his gambling intuition is enough to save a small time gambler, Nangou, and grant him a seat at the gambling table. As the night progresses, the stakes are raised both within the game and for Akagi, who is under the suspicion of local police. However, Akagi overcomes the situation with his tactics, defiant of both life and chance. When he leaves the gambling house, no one present is in doubt of his genius.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tEvxYOswOWjJymmeLV3CrLSWFcu.jpg", "actors": ["Isao Bit\u00f4 ()", "Takashi Kashiwabara ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
