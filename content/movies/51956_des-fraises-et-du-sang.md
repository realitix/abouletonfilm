While she quickly runs over to the toilets to dress, Simon protests to his roommate that their time should only be devoted to studying, so they can get good jobs and lots of money. Coming back clothed, the woman refuses setting another date with the roommate because she'll be busy protesting. She explains the university's plan to construct a gymnasium in an African-American neighborhood, thus causing conflict with the local African American population. She tells him that she and others plan to take over one of the university's buildings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/chNmG5Tiv3ppf5umMhg8JN5aP8A.jpg", "actors": ["Bruce Davison (Simon)", "Kim Darby (Linda)", "Bud Cort (Elliot - Coxswain)", "Murray MacLeod (George)", "Bob Balaban (Elliot - Organizer)", "Michael Margotta (Swatch)", "Israel Horovitz (Dr. Benton)", "James Kunen (Chairman)", "Jeannie Berlin (Girl with Clipboard)", "Carol Bagdasarian (Girl on Telephone)", "Jess Walton (Student)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [151307, 113936, 84922], "youtube_key": "UIgaarWfhsI"}
