Claiming innocently that she's just talking about everyday things - like what happen when you have sex, what happens when your parents walk in on you having sex - Suzanne's irreverently real style has everyone in the audience - gay or straight - turning to one another and gasping, That's me! Timeless, delicious and always outrageous, Suzanne's broad-based brand of humor crosses over the colorful spectrum of life, covering just about everything that can happen to you when you're living large from the bottom to the top!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jQb8ciBv28p7tUFM8icsyuClkWj.jpg", "actors": ["Suzanne Westenhoefer (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
