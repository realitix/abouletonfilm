Adorno famously taught. It shows two conservators scraping the walls of a lecture hall, looking for the legendary grey that Adorno had his classroom painted in order to promote concentration. The excavation is staged as a film set: the technical apparatus of the production is exposed and Steyerl\u2019s directions for the excavators can be heard off camera. The video returns to an image of a camera being set up to take a photo of the lectern.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nIzp5oPWezchS2ovXc1ZnpLVq3o.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
