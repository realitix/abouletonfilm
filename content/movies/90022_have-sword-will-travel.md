This year, however, he is afflicted with an infirmity that renders him unable to use his sword. Rather than give up this important commission and let the martial world know of his precarious health he means to entrust the consignment to two young knights in his manor, Hsiang Ting and Yun Piao-Piao. As it happens, these two are also betrothed; clearly they have their swordsmanship in common. At Peerless Manor, everyone is suspicious of malevolent strangers who may be sniffing around the silver transport. So when Le I appears astride a high-quality charger but otherwise clearly down on his luck, Hsiang Ting thinks Le I may be a spy for the bad guys in the Flying Tiger Manor. It doesn't help that Le I and Yun Piao-Piao hit it off right away. Even or especially when Le I saves Yun Piao-Piao from a Flying Tiger thug.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yGMISnGy4HdTLRtHw42RnJ6dTM8.jpg", "actors": ["David Chiang (Lo Yi)", "Ti Lung (Siang)", "Li Ching (Yun Piao Piao)", "Wong Chung (The Mute)", "Ku Feng (Chao Hong)", "Chan Sing ()", "Cheng Miu (Lord Yin)", "Cheng Lui (Wong Chuen)", "Wang Kuang-Yu (one of Lord Yin's men)", "Hung Lau (Chu Tin Hou, a Flying Tiger)", "Lau Gong (a Flying Tiger)", "Cliff Lok (a Flying Tiger)", "Cheng Kang-Yeh (Yang Hang Chiu)", "Wong Ching-Ho (Government official)", "Jason Pai Piao (Carries silver to the cart)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [50569, 46957, 36261, 75699], "youtube_key": "RYe4mG5cqr4"}
