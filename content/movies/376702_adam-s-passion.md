In the spectacular setting of a former submarine factory, American director and universal artist Robert Wilson creates a poetic visual world in which the mystical musical language of the Estonian composer Arvo P\u00e4rt can cast its meditative spell. Three of P\u00e4rt\u2019s major works \u2013 Adam\u2019s Lament, Tabula rasa, and Miserere, as well as Sequentia, a new work composed especially for this production \u2013 are brought together here using light, space, and movement to create a tightly-woven Gesamtkunstwerk in which the artistic visions of these two great artists mirror each other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tUidvHy40vyvajCHrec5rbtFt2Z.jpg", "actors": ["Michalis Theophanous (Man)", "Lucinda Childs (Woman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
