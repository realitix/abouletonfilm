Jimena Ayala plays a nun named Matilde who believes that eating next to nothing will help God stop the suffering of others. She trains pudgy, young Linda (Elisa Vicedo) for her first communion. Linda's mother is an emaciated exercise addict who frets over her daughter's shape. Linda's father, Gustavo, is a libertine who enjoys food as well as a healthy sex life with a mistress. Gustavo, an architect, must figure out why the pipes of a local school are leaking under the strain of a seemingly ceaseless rainstorm.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wrjNthJYwLXKhtXlwMORKBnTEXW.jpg", "actors": ["Ximena Ayala (Matilde)", "Elena de Haro (Elena)", "Marco Antonio Trevi\u00f1o (Gustavo)", "Aurora Cano (Teresa)", "Elisa Vicedo (Linda)", "Emilio Echevarr\u00eda (Ram\u00f3n - padre de Matilde)", "Patricia Reyes Sp\u00edndola (Madre Superiora)", "Milagros Vidal (Gordibuena)", "H\u00e9ctor T\u00e9llez (Sacerdote)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
