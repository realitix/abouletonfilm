The plan sought to evict thousands of farmers from their lands without any sort of respect for the locals\u2019 rights. Their resistance to eviction was met with extreme violence by the police. Activists from all over the country, including thousands of students, joined with the farmers in their mounting struggle. As the combats in Sanrizuka became more intense and the numbers of police increased, the collective became more involved in the fighting. Sanrizuka: The Three Day War was what Ogawa called a \u201cbullet film\u201d, an immediate and powerful piece of agitprop shot in three days and intended to be seen as quickly and widely as possible.
