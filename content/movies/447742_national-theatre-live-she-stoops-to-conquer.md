But thanks to playboy Lumpkin, he's mistaken by his prospective son-in-law Marlow for an innkeeper, his daughter for the local barmaid. The good news is, while Marlow can barely speak to a woman of quality he's a charmer with those of a different stamp. And so, as Hardcastle's indignation intensifies, Miss Hardcastle's appreciation for her misguided suitor soars. Misdemeanours multiply, love blossoms, mayhem ensues. One of the great, generous-hearted and ingenious comedies of the English language, Goldsmith's She Stoops to Conquer offers a celebration of chaos, courtship and the dysfunctional family.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m2e7uOqw39Dwn7Q5ItivtJIMbWy.jpg", "actors": ["David Fynn (Tony Lumpkin)", "Harry Hadden-Paton (Young Marlow)", "Oliver Jackson-Cohen (Diggory)", "Cush Jumbo (Miss Neville)", "Katherine Kelly (Miss Hardcastle)", "Steve Pemberton (Hardcastle)", "Zoe Rainey (Phyllis)", "Sophie Thompson (Mrs. Hardcastle)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
