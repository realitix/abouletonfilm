They remove the stake from the ground, allowing Laura (Caitlin McIntosh), a slumbering vampire, to revive and rise from the earth. Beaten and weak, Laura is unable to speak, remember who she is, or even the fact that she is a vampire! As Laura attempts to make sense of the strange new world around her, she begins to remember not only an idyllic human life in 1897 but the handsome Lazarus (Carlos Antonio Le\u00f3n), a mysterious lover who may not have had her best interests in mind. Soon Julian (Jason Contini), a world-weary vampire hunter employed by the church, begins tracking Laura, but as he closes in for the kill he learns that things are not what they seem.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b9CjEyEVfnkn53vGjOWexmIuEgj.jpg", "actors": ["Caitlin McIntosh (Laura)", "Jason Contini (Julian)", "Carlos Antonio Le\u00f3n (Lazarus)", "Robert Nolan Clark (Digger)", "Dale D.
