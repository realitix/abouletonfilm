Most of the filming takes place in Funchal, the capital of the islands. There are flowers everywhere. The influence of Portuguese explorers is evident in the architecture and dress. Christopher Columbus was married here and lived on the island several years. Narrator FitzPatrick takes a ride in the local mode of transportation: a large basket sledge on wooden rails. A small coastal fishing village is also featured.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hXkZH46ps9C7cqV8cl6SLVqpmKp.jpg", "actors": ["James A.
