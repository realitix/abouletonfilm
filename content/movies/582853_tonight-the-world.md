Through five chapters, the film links as many dreams sited in Susi\u2019s childhood home, Villa Stiassni, a modernist mansion built by Susi\u2019s parents, who were prominent Jewish textile manufacturers in the industrial hub of Brno.  Conjured in Susi\u2019s imagination from her middle-age onwards, in the context of psychoanalysis, the dream diaries as a whole span 40 years and 40,000 dreams, but Martin\u2019s selection focuses tightly on dreams about intruders within the Villa, recreating a narrative of threat and escape that parallels Susi\u2019s lived experience.  Retracing the legacy of her grandmother\u2019s emotional history, Martin considers the unconscious underpinnings of intergenerational trauma, loss and resilience.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Hayley Carmichael ()", "Lynn Farleigh ()", "Bowie Lucca ()", "Flora Nicholson ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
