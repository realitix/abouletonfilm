However, he doesn't have much skill at it, and poorly considered bets have drained the bank account he'd set aside for his daughter's education. Brendan's wife has made Brendan promise to give up gambling, but when their daughter announces she's just been accepted to Trinity College in Ireland, Brendan has to come up with the tuition money, and fast. While doing his sweeping at work, Brendan makes a remarkable discovery - the preserved head of an aboriginal tribesman who, under proper conditions, can pick the winners in horse races.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qRHHEqfAsUcWfYJloSSjb52HQVG.jpg", "actors": ["Dan Aykroyd (Dr. Barry Davis)", "Robbie Coltrane (Delaney)", "Brenda Blethyn (Mrs. Delaney)", "Tony Briggs (Michael Miller)", "Jim Norton (Patrick Cassidy)", "Sinead Keenan (Sinead Delaney)", "Cathy Murphy (Dolores)", "Zara Turner (Carol Lenahan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
