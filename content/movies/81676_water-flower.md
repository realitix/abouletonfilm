The situation is exacerbated when he comes home drunk one night and tries to climb on top of her. Minako's mother deserted them for another man when Minako was a child. Now working as a hostess, she has little time for her own six year-old daughter, Yu, Minako's half sister. Both girls are yearning for their mother's love. Minako runs into Yu at a game center in the mall and proposes they take a trip. She changes out of her school uniform and into adult clothes and the pair hops on an overnight bus out of the city.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sUwFj7vQlszZgrXC9NpBRcnHaQ1.jpg", "actors": ["Azusa Hibino (Yuriko)", "Asuka Kurosawa (Shiori Nagahara)", "Tomi Nakaho (Yumiko Sasaki)", "Himawari Ono (Yu Nagahara)", "Minami Orimoto (Tomoko)", "Tetsushi Tanaka (Keisuke Takatsuki)", "Saki Terashima (Minako Takatsuki)", "Takehito Terui (Ryota Sasaki)", "Kanji Tsuda (Takashi Nagahara)", "Saeka Uehara (Kaoru)", "Nozomi Yasuda (Maki)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
