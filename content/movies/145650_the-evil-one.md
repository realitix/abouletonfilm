When a newspaper photographer uncovers evidence linking the murders to the past, however, the intimations are almost unthinkable. Herman Webster Mudgett Jr., who was buried face down in the late 1800s after achieving the distinction of becoming America's first serial killer, seems to be back and out for revenge. The intrepid reporter has a personal stake in the mystery, as her mother was murdered by a descendant of Mudgett's; she sets out to discover if the urge to kill has been passed down in the blood, or if the culprit is truly from beyond the grave. This hip urban thriller strikes an effectively creepy mood, and features a talented cast that is almost entirely African American.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kX4Gcf2KIiy34MRS1rTKpSSv4sX.jpg", "actors": ["Candace Carey (Tina Moore)", "Eric Lane (Chris Jones)", "Big Gipp (Smoke)", "Shawna (Teacher)", "Mike McNamara (Herman Mudgett Jr.)", "Arthur Simone (Herman Mudgett Sr.)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
