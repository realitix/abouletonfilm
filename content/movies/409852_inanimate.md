Having returned to reality from an inner voyage to death and back in a coma\u2013like state he finds himself abandoned in a cold and unforgiving world devoid of purpose. As memories of his lover slowly reform and solidify in his mind he sets out on a journey to rediscover the distant and immediately recent events that lead to his hospitalization.
