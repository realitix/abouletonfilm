He's engulfed in the war between rebels and government troops when a US advisor orders the army to open a staging area by the boy's hamlet. Alsino tries to be a child, climbing trees with a girl, looking through his grandfather's trunk of mementos and trying to fly; he goes to town to sell a saddle, has his first drink and is taken to a brothel. But the war surrounds him. The US advisor takes Alsino on a chopper flight, but he's unimpressed. The soldiers' cruelties awake rebel sympathies in Alsino, and after an army assault backfires, the lad is fully baptized into the conflict.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lA63jM8zdLcLmt2UBoDoZeW9GqU.jpg", "actors": ["Dean Stockwell (Frank)", "Alan Esquivel (Alsino)", "Carmen Bunster (Alsino's Grandmother)", "Alejandro Parodi (The Major)", "Marta Lorena P\u00e9rez (Lucia)", "Reynaldo Miravalles (Don Nazario, the Birdman)", "Marcelo Gaete (Lucia's Grandfather)", "Jan Kees De Roy (Dutch Adviser)", "Delia Casanova (Rosaria)", "Luz Amparo Guti\u00e9rrez ()", "Jan Kees de Rooy (Dutch Adviser)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [59877, 54976], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
