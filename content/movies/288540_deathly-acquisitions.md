He has his plans, he has his team, all he needs is a loan from the bank. Bernie is a young loan broker on the last day of his apprenticeship. He has to seal a deal - preferably one that won't sink the bank into receivership or ruin it's reputation - or he's back working on the tellers - if they'll have him, his boss Greg warns. Bernie and Colossomus eventually come to an agreement, without either compromising their principles, and a reluctant hero emerges.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8wjlWuPvVz48mrXIXZGRf6Jda2H.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Molnar (Mister Colossomus)", "Robert Bronev (Bernie)", "Claudio Trovato (Greg Doorman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
