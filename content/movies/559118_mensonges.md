One day, Marie meets Olivier Dumas-Beaulieu, a handsome industrialist, who is in the process of leaving his fianc\u00e9e Corinne, despite her being pregnant by him. It is easy for the confirmed womanizer he is, to seduce Marie, who very foolishly thinks she has found true love. Shortly afterward Charles is shot dead by Olivier while the two men were having a quarrel about Marie. The latter, who finds the corpse, believes her husband has committed suicide. Which is not the police's opinion and Marie is arrested and condemned to ten years in prison. Annihilated by such unfair treatment and, worse, by the separation from her beloved eight-year-old daughter, she still manages to survive and to serve her sentence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/21Je8BYp1yzKyojdqSiNTcBv1zN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
