Recorded at the renowned Bottom Line Cabaret in New York's Greenwich Village, Tony is in his favorite element, backed by his favorite group, the Ralph Sharon Trio. In addition to his megahit \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco,\" Tony performs American music classics by such great lyricists and composers as Richard Rodgers, George Gershwin, Cole Porter, and Duke Ellington. The camera work and live recording capture the intimate feeling of being at a ringside table--the quintessential way to enjoy the magic of Tony Bennett. Now you can watch the master performing songs that, like Tony himself, will live forever in your heart.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cgIjNMub8HIi2ur3fNrw6Pl3h8x.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
