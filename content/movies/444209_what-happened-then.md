The prosecution allows his motive was fear of being disinherited if he married his fianc\u00e9, the fair Alicia Atherton, against his uncle's wishes, and the prosecution lays a mountain of evidence against Raymond, including his razor, dragged from an artificial lake on the estate, as the murder weapon; Raymond's bloody fingerprints and footprints found at the scene of bedroom crime, and his bloody shoes, found in his cupboard and bloody monogrammed-handkerchief found under his uncle's death bed. Raymond's only defense is that he could not have committed the crime as he goes into a paroxysm of dread at the mere sight of blood, a phobia he has had ever since childhood when his dog was run over by a lorry and the dog's blood was splattered into his face.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hjGD4vpDPhIrxMZPiXo4VvefokT.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Bird (Peter Bromley)", "Lorna Hubbard (Alicia Altherton)", "Geoffrey Wardwell (Raymond Rudford)", "Francis L.
