When Sasha grows up to become a teenager, she thinks that she can have some time for herself, so she responds to the courtship of Nikolai Sergeyevich. One summer, Sasha goes to visit his real father in Novosibirsk, on the other side of the country. When he returns, his mother notices that Sasha has changed. She secretly reads a letter sent to Sasha from his father and finds out that Sasha doesn\u2019t want to live with her any longer. She doesn\u2019t have enough wisdom to understand this desire on someone else\u2019s part. Sasha is shown to have a more delicate and understanding nature than his mother, for when he realizes that she is suffering because of his wish to leave, even though he is tired of her nagging, he decides to stay.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3g3V6sP8kqjUcXCEQFQ8tja83UU.jpg", "actors": ["Zinaida Sharko (Yevgeniya Vasilyevna)", "Oleg Vladimirsky (Ustinov)", "Tatyana Mychko ()", "Yuri Kayurov (Nikulin)", "Svetlana Kabanova ()", "Lidiya Dranovskaya ()", "Lidiya Brazilskaya ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [149467, 325559, 162394, 149937], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
