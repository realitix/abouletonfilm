Orphaned when a child, Yumi she was raised by Shizuko, the madame of a geisha house. Yumi is impulsive, out-going. And although she cannot claim to be good at Japanese dancing or playing musical instruments so necessary to a geisha, she is a whizz at go-go and will dance the hula at parties. But before becoming a full-fledged geisha, Yumi must go through the ceremony of the \"mizuage\", when a budding geisha surrenders her virginity to an experienced man who makes her a woman. Takida, a rich money-lender, is chosen for Yumi's mizuage but she offers herself first to Keiichi (Ryo Tamura), who she really loves although she knows that his world and hers are too far apart for a successful marriage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cO8LJQkk72wHxJsjglDHbgp7hgy.jpg", "actors": ["Mari Atsumi (Yumi Ishikawa)", "Keiko Takahashi (Setsuko)", "Eiko Yanami (Nakako)", "Ry\u00f4 Tamura (Keiichi Tsumura)", "Masaya Takahashi (Matsuzaki)", "Toyoto Fukuda (Tetsuya Takita)", "Yoshi Kat\u00f4 (Takita)", "Tomoko Mayama (Kikuchiyo)", "Keiko Natsu (Hatsuko)", "Hisano Yamaoka (Shizuko)", "Takuro Nakayoshi (Sekizawa)", "Yutaka Nakamura ()", "Daigo Inoue ()", "Kenji Go (Manager)", "Tsutomu Nakata (Adachi)", "Misako Shimizu (Rikiya)", "Mitsuko Takesato (Hairdresser)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
