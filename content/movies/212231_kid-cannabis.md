This was one of the teen movie based on the true story of the two friends which is mostly uninspiring, but a well told story.\r\n\r\nThe young actor from one of my favorite teen movie 'Project X' was incredibly good. He's really showing some characters that he may become a valuable property in the Hollywood in the near future. He also reminds me a crossover outcome of Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill.\r\n\r\nWell the story was about two school dropouts who decide to do business on marijuana import-export. Since it is not illegal in the nearby place to their's across the border, they draw a master plan to execute and succeeds and what comes later is you've to see. Actually, one of a better movie told from the negative side of the social welfare. So good to enjoy the film, but not to follow it."}], "recommandations_id": [242083, 113693, 77665, 281418], "youtube_key": "U1_casgexVE"}
