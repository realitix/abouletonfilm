A few ominous omens try to avert him from his decision, like a bloodstain on the floor or his tongue turning black, but Damien pays little attention. He arranges a sojourn at one of Father Pierre\u2019s centers. When he arrives, he\u2019s greeted by the three employees of the center, a trinity as silent as disturbing who slurp from their soup as voraciously as Hannibal Lecter from a dish of lamb brains. Just like Alice In Wonderland, our reporter finds himself in a surreal universe. Every door he opens, will confront him with his own demons : his cowardice, his incapacity to decide anything and his continuous flight from responsibility.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2XmxsKNBo6U9Eo5TCZ9IsE7AkjI.jpg", "actors": ["Damien Desamory ()", "Antonia Baehr ()", "Lucile Desamory ()", "Frederique Franke ()", "Lucy McKenzie ()", "Aline Moroccutti ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
