It\u2019s a barren land, sometimes it\u2019s like it\u2019s from another planet but still familiar. It is land of contrasts and colours with wide landscapes and fascinating deserts. Influenced by various cultures during colonization and now reborn from the shadows of Apartheid in 1990, Namibia gives a beautiful collage of culture, language, art, music and food.  Everyone who loves an adventure should travel to Namibia, the precious corner of our world full of incredible natural wonders. The experience of endless landscapes and an unparalleled blaze of colour make Namibia unforgettable.  NAMIBIA \u2013 THE SPIRIT OF WILDERNESS invites you on a trip whose fascination will never let you go: From the Namib Desert over the breath-taking Fish River Canyon to the spectacular Etosha National Park where you will see wild elephants, antelopes, giraffes, zebras and lions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xqEsepxFodwB4iBiSLQBpGLOvEX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
