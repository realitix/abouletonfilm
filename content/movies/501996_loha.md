Elsewhere, Arjun (Mithun Chakraborty), an ex-military man, has forfeited his love and career as a consequence of hitching up with a local goon. As a result, Arjun seeks his refuge in liquor.  Shankar chances upon Arjun and rescues him when Arjun hits rock bottom. Meanwhile, angered by Shankar's meddling, Lukka rapes and kills Shankar's sister to teach him a lesson. Infuriated, Shankar teams up with Arjun, who now is indebted to him, and Mustafabhai (Shakti Kapoor), who wants payback for Lukka chopping his hands off.
