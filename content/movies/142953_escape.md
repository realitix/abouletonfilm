They jump a freight train and make their way to the Mediterranean coast, and hide out in an isolated mansion by the sea.  In spite of the fact that it's the off-season for tourism, the house seems to be well maintained and strangely well stocked. Almost as strange as the sudden appearance of Nina, a young foreigner, whom the three fugitives have no choice but to hold against her will.  However, when Nina is followed by some shady Russian mafia figures, our 'heroes' become accidentally involved in a plutonium-trafficking scheme. In this fast moving feature nobody is what they seem and three escaped criminals turn out to be the only ones amidst lies, plots and seduction who act in the name of honesty.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ig7kupEnn75wnBxXIuJ4dXF7vpW.jpg", "actors": ["Sancho Gracia (El Manco)", "Pablo Carbonell (Santos)", "Carlos Fuentes (Dani)", "Elsa Pataky (Nina)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
