Fortunately Hanna-Barbera provided a worthy substitute in animated form as up to 45 of their cartoon characters (classic and otherwise) were featured on this show competing for the gold medal. While some events were similar to real-life Olympic events, most were pretty offbeat and quite unusual, and could only be done on cartoons like this. Among these weird events were racing on ostriches, camels, kangaroos, rickshaws and unicycles, as well as scavenging for creatures like the Abominable Snowman, vampires, and the Loch Ness Monster. With events like these, each Laff-A-Lympics was bound to be a major adventure!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4uwsGdYPF5ACPk8O2OVbEwVJWmf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
