The film never lets you forget that what you\u2019re seeing is simply paint being rearranged into recognizable shapes, yet the pumping musical score and expressiveness of its titular character provide a simultaneous emotional experience. The abstract backgrounds render the narrative world beautiful and strange yet entirely comprehensible, as the film depicts an epic chase from humanity\u2019s past.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yRZBa833KWePUs2Ox5va8OrpidB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
