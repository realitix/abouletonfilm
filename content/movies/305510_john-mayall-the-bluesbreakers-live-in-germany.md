This release features Mayall in a hard-driving, sharp set of original and classic numbers captured live on tour in 1988. This concert serves to remind us of the genius with which this pioneering artist almost single-handedly revived the Blues, and how he has made them his own over a phenomenal career in music. Featuring the paired lead guitars of Walter Trout and Coco Montoya, the band rocks hard in a tight groove that enables searing solos from the featured guitarists as well as from Mayall himself on guitar and keyboards. The guttural power of Mayall's vocals is ever-present. And the songs - most of them Mayall originals - include the classic Room To Move, with which John Mayall once electrified the world of Rock 'n' Roll.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6bBlFZZwMOmbOJ1Tu8pSM7jKt9P.jpg", "actors": ["Walter Trout (Guitar)", "Coco Montoya (Guitar)", "John Mayall (Vocals, Guitar & Keyboards)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
