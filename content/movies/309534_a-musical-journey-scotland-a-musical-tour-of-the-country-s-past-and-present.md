Although the accompanying soundtrack doesn't feature Scottish music per se, the selections -- including Mendelssohn's Symphony no. 3 (\"The Scottish Symphony\") and Donizetti's \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" -- fit the spirit of the scenery.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
