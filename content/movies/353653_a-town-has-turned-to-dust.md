The slaughter leads to a brooding darkness involving the remorseful relatives of the Mexican youngster and the sullen townspeople. Almost by a chain reaction there is established a second set of circumstances inviting a lynching of the Mexican's brother. Only this time the sheriff recaptures a shred of human dignity and saves the brother, if not the town.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8QtkeV8oB81bsrCXOyQLWZeHbqv.jpg", "actors": ["Rod Steiger (Harvey Denton)", "William Shatner (Jerry Paul)", "Fay Spain (Annamay Paul)", "James Gregory (Hennify)", "Mario Alcalde (Ramon Rivera)", "Mart\u00edn Garralaga (The Priest)", "Eugene Iglesias (Pancho Rivera)", "Malcolm Atterbury (Jenkins)", "Paul Lambert (Danny)", "Sandy Kenyon (Billy)", "Clegg Hoyt (Mr. Flagg)", "Eddie Ryder (Pete Ankers)", "Helen Kleeb (Mrs. Flagg)", "Miriam Col\u00f3n (Dolores)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
