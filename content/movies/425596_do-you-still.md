This documentary tries, and mostly manages, to balance the picture by capturing private solo improv sessions, both indoors and outdoors, that display Reijseger's mastery over different colors and tones - with the same astounding technique and soulful commitment. Interspersed with beautiful country- and city-side footage that evokes his ever contemplative music, Do You Still? also features intimate and sometimes bitter-sweet statements by Reijseger on his early years, \"career\" choices, mannerisms, anxieties and shortcomings.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Ernst Reijseger (Himself / Cello)", "Larissa Groenveld (Herself / Cello)", "Frank Van De Laar (Piano)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
