Filmed 12 years apart, the 1958 concert features Dizzy working eloquently within the small combo structure of a quintet including such influential musicians as sax player Sonny Stitt and bassist Ray Brown. The second show focuses on a completely different side of Dizzy, fronting the legendary Kenny Clarke-Francy Boland Big Band. With a 16-piece big band to conduct, including two drummers, his Latin influences are revealed on \"Con Alma\" and \"Manteca.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aiLr7iGm8OfE5D9Dd2dMRMIca14.jpg", "actors": ["Dizzy Gillespie ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
