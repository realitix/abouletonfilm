Three musicians \u2013 a glimpse into the unknown, all\u2013 but \u2013 lost art of leaf playing. Filled with stunning music as vital yet as fragile as the perishable instrument on which it's played, this lovely film is as much about joy, living in the moment, being alive, as it is about making music.
