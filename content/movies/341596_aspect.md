Matter and the immaterial in constant counteraction. The screen becomes a painting in animation. Ordinarily, light describes the motif. Here, the forest is almost \u2013 almost \u2013 occluded as the light that delineates the world becomes autonomous, visible; describes itself as subject. There are some very strange effects: light and shadow grow, die back; bark shimmers; branches tremble, or clouds pass above; trees shiver in the cold, or shake in threatening gesture; sunlight flickers, on and off, like an electric bulb. The portrait lives.  These films are not the index of space and objects, but a cinema of time, movement, light; flickering lashes of mesmerised eyes in the click of an aperture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rWB1hX4EHb4mlHre0ZGbhHApQDm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
