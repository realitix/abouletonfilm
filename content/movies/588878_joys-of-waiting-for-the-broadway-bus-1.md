We often give up and walk. When we commit ourselves to waiting the bus usually appears with a second bus, empty, trailing by a block. We assume the drivers feel free to stop and gab between rounds; not nice, but then the job is impossible and it\u2019s understandable they need a break, some social activity. There\u2019s a couple of stops we wait at a lot, after visiting with friend Max or returning at night from Anthology Film Archives. Worse for Flo than for me; I photograph. I dawdle in the streets in any case, photographing a compulsion since getting a 3D camera. And night is a great time for time-exposures, for distortions in 3D.\" - Ken Jacobs", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
