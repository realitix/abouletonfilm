It is set on Midsummer's Eve on the estate of a Count. The young woman of the title is drawn to a senior servant, a valet named Jean (Nicolas Bouchaud), who is particularly well-traveled, well-mannered and well-read. The action takes place in the kitchen of Mademoiselle Julie's father's manor, where Jean's fianc\u00e9e, a servant named Christine (B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Cerutti), cooks and sometimes sleeps while Jean and Miss Julie talk.  On this night the relationship between Miss Julie and Jean escalates rapidly to feelings of love and is subsequently consummated. Over the course of the play Miss Julie and Jean battle until Jean convinces her that the only way to escape her predicament is to commit suicide.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1E92a6oVVZJL9o1OYa12UHttxB8.jpg", "actors": ["Juliette Binoche (Mademoiselle Julie)", "Nicolas Bouchaud (Jean)", "B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Cerruti (Christine)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
