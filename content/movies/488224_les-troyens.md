Cassandra tries to warn of the terrible fate to come, but fate is set and Troy falls. The first two acts cover this tragic end, then the flight of survivors to Carthage and events at Carthage continue in acts 3 - 5, culminating in the further voyage for Italy and Rome. This is Virgil's classic epic, in operatic form, in about a three and a half hour performance from French Opera.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ApmSDxGOhDOcVxKvhDYfjyZFKAS.jpg", "actors": ["Anna Caterina Antonacci (Cassandra)", "Gregory Kunde (Aeneas)", "Ludovic T\u00e9zier (Chor\u00e8be)", "Laurent Naouri (Narbal)", "Renata Pokupi\u0107 (Anna)", "Susan Graham (Dido)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
