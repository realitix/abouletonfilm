Magalis is a nurse, rarely happy. An older man, Ignacio, professes his love for her; her father and her brother quarrel over her brother's sexual orientation; she thinks about leaving Cuba. Santo's wife Maria is expecting their first child. Tragedy strikes and Santo leaves, drowning sorrows in alcohol and crime while his son grows up in the care of an aunt wondering where dad is. Vivian and Chino are in love, passionate, but childless. The pressures of a society that demands grandchildren strain their relationship.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rmyVvfWgeQkSjbJik4LodNCfWq7.jpg", "actors": ["Jorge Perugorr\u00eda ()", "Luisa Mar\u00eda Jim\u00e9nez Rodr\u00edquez ()", "Isabel Cristina Santos T\u00e9llez ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
