There are no sounds other than the sync sounds that accompany the images. The sections devoted to five ceremonies are separated by \u201cInterludes\u201d that introduce other material, some of it threaded throughout. This is a tightly wound network of sonic and visual connections, with secret passages between elements. Thoughts about the relationship between ceremonies and personal and political life can arise, and of spectatorship in and outside of cinema, video and dreams.\" \u2013 Larry Gottheim", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6k310FzjXwA6dNHnI0Jr4WLn5CM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
