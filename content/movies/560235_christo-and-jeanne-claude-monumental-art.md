Inspired by ancient Mesopotamian tombs, the Mastaba is constructed from 7,506 painted oil barrels and weighs six hundred tonnes. It is the latest work in a career spanning half a century and stretching across the world. His work to date have included surrounding 11 islands off the Florida coast with pink polypropylene and wrapping Berlin's Reichstag and the Pont Neuf in Paris.  This programme charts the creation of the Mastaba - from the first barrels being put on the water to its final unveiling - and paints a portrait of Christo as he looks back on a life spent making provocative works of art with his wife and partner Jeanne-Claude.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w1Z77wYM1BsMWtzkqkb6OiZakTf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
