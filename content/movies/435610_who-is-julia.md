At nearly the same time, a very plain looking lower middle class woman simply faints and suffers brain death. The beautiful womans brain is fine, so, doctors merely transplant her brain into plain Jane. Problems ensue when plain Janes husband continues to believe she is still his wife. She has no memory of him, and goes to live with the beautiful womans husband. She doesn't mix well with her new socialite friends and family. Mirrors are emotional battlefields as well.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oTvzHTKgj6iEUtDw9rTTfpNaq7K.jpg", "actors": ["Mare Winningham (Mary Frances Bodine)", "Jameson Parker (Don North)", "Jeffrey DeMunn (Dr. David Matthews)", "Jonathan Banks (Jack Bodine)", "Bert Remsen (Joseph Dineen)", "Mason Adams (Dr. Gordon)", "James Handy (Bob Greenmeyer)", "Philip Baker Hall (Dean May)", "Tracy Brooks Swope (Loni)", "Judith Ledford (Julia North)", "Ford Rainey (The Commentator)", "Joel Colodner (Dr. Carlson)", "Bruce French (Dr. Haverford)", "Clare Nono (Kathy)", "Patricia Smith (Marlene)", "John Hammil (Dr. Lehman)", "George Cheung (Dr. Cheung)", "Robert Lesser (Dr. Stone)", "Ben Ryan Ganger (Timmy)", "Michael Mitz (Dr. Hankin)", "Clare Wren (Sandy)", "David Selburg (On Scene Reporter)", "Steve Pershing (Paramedic)", "Lance Rosen (First Senator)", "Ken Hill (Second Senator)", "Peter MacLean (Newscaster)", "William Harlow (Reporter)", "Julian Christopher (Reporter)", "Brendon Boone (Reporter)", "Dolores Domasin (Nurse)", "Ellaraino (Receptionist)", "Sonia Kara (Reporter)", "Jean Levine (Nurse)", "Marti Litis (Reporter)", "Michael Masters (Santa)", "Ed McCready (Lieutenant Tyler)", "Bruce Reed (Mechanic)", "Ron Shotola (Police Officer)", "Buck Young (Police Officer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
