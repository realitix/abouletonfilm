He enlists the help of the Duchess of Burwood (Alcoholic Aristocrat played by Rose Alba) as a teacher and Hector (Cockney Geezer played by Nosher Powell) as fitness instructor. A probation officer friend supplies the first batch of pupils fresh from Holloway prison via a clapped out old mini bus. Suspicious neighbours and police together with newspaper reports naming the prison girls now hobnobbing in high society results in a raid and new court appearance for Lord Wingate. The Judge sentences him but plots to start up his own 'school for sex'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ws917IRBmYBJnAtZrVscf1vj5mt.jpg", "actors": ["Derek Aylward (Giles Wingate)", "Rose Alba (Countess of Burwash)", "Bob Andrews (Sgt.
