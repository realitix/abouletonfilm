The final image of the film carries a great deal of significance. It opens up a gap between the film\u2019s appearance and its reality; what it appears to be \u2013 what it imitates \u2013 is not an object or scene from everyday life, but a film. Atmosphere is not just an imitation, but an imitation of an imitation, a metafilm that plays with the viewers\u2019 expectations about cinematic form.  \u2014R.
