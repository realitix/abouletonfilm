Dunn profiles artists spanning six decades, including Bruce Davidson, Mary Ellen Mark, Jill Freedman, Jeff Mermelstein and Martha Cooper, revealing that these shooters are as colourful and unique as the subjects they\u2019ve relentlessly documented. Everybody Street explores the passion that compelled Freedman to spend years riding in squad cars during the most violent years in the city; Bruce Gilden\u2019s drive to thrust his camera in people\u2019s faces to capture a moment; and Martha Cooper\u2019s dedication to chasing graffiti on passing subway cars in the Bronx. The film is a definitive look at the iconic visionaries of this often imitated art form.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dlyd8qTpXF5GvQ2skIuf4U5arhP.jpg", "actors": ["Bruce Davidson ()", "Martha Cooper ()", "Elliott Erwitt ()", "Jill Freedman ()", "Bruce Gilden ()", "Max Kozloff ()", "Rebecca Lepkoff ()", "Mary Ellen Mark ()", "Jeff Mermelstein ()", "Joel Meyerowitz ()", "Clayton Patterson ()", "Ricky Powell ()", "Luc Sante ()", "Jamel Shabazz ()", "Boogie ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
