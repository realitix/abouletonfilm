Then we flash forward to a mother who has brought her haunted daughter (also named Pyun-gang) to a psychic, who informs her that her daughter is haunted by the ghost of the princess . He then goes on to say that the girl must marry her On-dal by her 16 birthday and produce a child within a year otherwise she will die. The family treats it skeptically until years later, Pyun-gang has several near-death experiences and is immediately spooked, convinced she is going to die. As luck would have it, soon thereafter, a new transfer student joins Pyun-gang's class. His name is On-dal, and he's intelligent, handsome and rich which really doesn't make the prospect of high school marriage such a tough deal for Pyun-gang, what with her impending death and all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iYARJ0XADYiojW7TxNBDReoJ4Ue.jpg", "actors": ["Lim Eun-kyoung (Pyung Gang)", "Eun Ji-won (Park On-dal)", "Shim Yi-Young (Jang Yoo-Sun)", "Kim Chung ()", "Lee Kan-hie ()", "Lim Seong-eon (Yoo Hye-Sook)", "Park No-shik (Roh Chil-Soo)", "Lee Ho-Seong ()", "Lee Jang-Suk ()", "Byeon Ju-Yeon (Pyung Gang (young))", "Lee Eun-mi-I (school nurse)", "Yoon Ki-won ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
