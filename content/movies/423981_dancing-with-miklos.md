We both loved his work and we both, perhaps for our own reasons, wanted to know how he managed to make films of such immense visual power so quickly and so inexpensively. It was not long before I had succumbed to the by now banal idea of filming filmmaking. In due course I also proceeded to betray my deepest aesthetic principles by agreeing to shoot it in (Hi8) video. Dancing with Miklos is the outcome, greatly enhanced by Zsuzsi Csakany (Jansco)\u2019s sharp eye for her husband\u2019s craft. It is, though admittedly lighthearted, a deeply felt tribute to a fellow filmmaker\u2019s grace.\"  - Robert Gardner", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4R83jzDb9EcCjU7z6S9GI4K171b.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
