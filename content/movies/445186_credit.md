The 25-year old young woman is married and works as manager; she is paying off a long-term mortgage. One day she finds out that she has an incurable disease and that her husband, an airline steward, has perished in an air crash. The insurance sum is sufficient to cover the mortgage in one lump sum... An allusion to people trading the best years of their life for an apartment, only in this case the trade is literally between an apartment and life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ehyy4jFBjU9CAiR95Dz81RcG5io.jpg", "actors": ["Polina Smykovskaya ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
