As Billy Phelps and John McCormick suffer through financial crisis, the loss of their chef, and a crumbling relationship, the filmmakers turn the camera on New York City's legendary restaurateurs who prove that dreams can come true. Billy and John's gamble to open a restaurant together takes shape on Division Street, a unique block in Brooklyn that separates the Satmar Jewish community of Williamsburg from the Latino neighborhood of the South Side. During the course of a year, they convert a former check-cashing shop located under the elevated train tracks of the J/M/Z subway lines into a retro speakeasy. But before the restaurant is fully built they come close to bankruptcy and almost call it quits on their friendship.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gjn2gLDKdbTBekUGqknuOn1vzKY.jpg", "actors": ["Daniel Boulud (himself)", "Rocco DiSpirito (himself)", "Sirio Maccioni (himself)", "John McCormick (himself)", "Keith McNally (himself)", "Danny Mayer (himself)", "Drew Nieporent (himself)", "Bill Phelps (himself)", "Ruth Reichl (herself)", "Jean-Georges Vongerichten (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "BLiGur42Qco"}
