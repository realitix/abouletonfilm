His job is to keep a major rocket project completely dust-free, and this he does with his own hilariously fantastic inventions - including a literal attack on dirt by a \"knight on a white horse\". In his work, he meets Judy, a chimp involved in a top-secret project, which leads Melvin into the one room strictly off-limits to him. Not until he has entered the project room does Melvin learn that any man entering it will be negatively ionized - making him fly like a bird.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ssQzWIO8ZtPxYRSyyOpYdWJM2PN.jpg", "actors": ["Soupy Sales (Melvin Byrd)", "Tab Hunter (Lt.
