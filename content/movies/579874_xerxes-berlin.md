He always gets his way, until one day he falls for his brother\u2019s secret lover.  Xerxes\u2019 tactics, which he changes as often as his opulent costumes, allow his opponents little time to rest. This results in a \u2018baroque Muppet Show,\u2019 as the celebrated Norwegian director Stefan Herheim describes his spectacular stage production.
