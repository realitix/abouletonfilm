In 1977 he filmed 60 locations in Milwaukee\u2019s industrial valley each for 60 seconds, creating short, minimal, playful narratives. In 2004 he remade the film as Twenty Seven Years Later, with the same 60 camera positions. This 2012 installation version, presents 18 locations similar to, and reminiscent of, the original.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hp8Qt9jwIiR5Q0gkLjaJZlmLuLr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
