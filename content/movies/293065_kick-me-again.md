When a married student falls for her portly dance instructor, Puffy is forced to flee in a ballet tutu from the clutches of her jealous husband. The usual slapstick complications ensue before the cross-dressing funnyman finally locates a new suit of clothes. The viewing pleasure comes not from the run-of-the-mill gags and storyline but from seeing a master wring every ounce of comedy from his ungainly outfit.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Charles Puffy (Puffy)", "Mildred June ()", "Billy Engle (Professor Lightfoot)", "Bud Jamison (Edward Jamison - Jealous Husband)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
