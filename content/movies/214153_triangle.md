The association is with the triangle shape, in a human context involving the introduction of a second woman into the mix. This triggers a dynamic of jealousy and rage, though it seems reconciled at the end. Nominated for an Oscar in 1995 it is a wonderfully envigorating fusion of dance, music and animation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3ft2AuCuPxQH7pLlDDWdMwH9Hbn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
