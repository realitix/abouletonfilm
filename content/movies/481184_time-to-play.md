My concern in a nut shell, is for the future of humanity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yPEwTakUU72BIBFPxgTrQt862VQ.jpg", "actors": ["Adam Blanning (Himself - MD)", "Joy Winchell (Herself - MEd)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "_RasrbkPNPc"}
