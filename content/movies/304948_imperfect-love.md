In the dream, she meets Julio, 10 years after their separation and one day before his move to Norway. An invitation from Julio takes then on a nostalgic journey through the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, visiting hidden and well-known places they used to enjoy years before. Places that once nurtured their love and will now help its rebirth. But who says we have to accept what destiny presents to us?
