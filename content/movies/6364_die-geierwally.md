He wants to marry the rich, but boring, Vincent (Leopold Esterle). Wally escapes to a mountain hut, where she lives alone and withdrawn. Her love belongs to the hunter, Joseph (Sepp Rist). When she unwisely takes a young vulture from its nest and is attacked by the mother, Joseph comes to her aid and from that point on, she fondly calls him her \"Geierwally\". He also feels attracted to her, but Wally can't escape the feeling, that the young Afra is his mistress. Mad with jealousy, Wally announces that she'll marry the one who kills Josef. Vincent wants to earn her hand and is determined to kill the Geierwally. Just in time, though, the actual relationship between Joseph and Afra is clarified.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gvKnX0K2uLesH3arVzka7n3F8Ti.jpg", "actors": ["Heidemarie Hatheyer (Wally Fender ( Geierwally ))", "Sepp Rist (Joseph Brandt ( B\u00e4renjoseph ))", "Eduard K\u00f6ck (Alois Fender)", "Winnie Markus (Afra Kuttner)", "Leopold Esterle (Vinzenz Gellner)", "Mimi Gst\u00f6ttner-Auer (Luckard)", "Ludwig Auer (Klettenmeier)", "Maria Hofen (Mariann Rosenbauer)", "Georg Vogelsang (Nicodemus Rosenbauer)", "K\u00e4te Merk (Resi)", "Marta Salm (Obermagd)", "Anna Exl (Ochsenwirtin)", "Hans Kratzer (Dorfbote)", "Gustav Waldau (Graf)", "Franz Ludwig (Oberf\u00f6rster)", "Rolf Pinegger (B\u00fcrgermeister)", "Hans Hanauer (Lehrer)", "Franzl Gr\u00fcner (H\u00fcterjunge)", "Hans Adalbert Schlettow (Leander Rosenbauer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
