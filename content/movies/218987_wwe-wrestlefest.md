Taped from Milwaukee, Wisconsin in the latter part of July 1988, with the wonderful combination of Sean Mooney, Lord Alred Hayes, and Superstar Billy Graham on the call.  The main event was Hulk Hogan versus Andre the Giant in a steel cage match. The British Bulldogs challenged Tag Team Champions Demolition while WWF Champion Randy 'Macho Man' Savage defended against challenger Ted DiBiase.  There were 15 matches total.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9oF5e3K7qBv5MfvCvNiCFS9L7eS.jpg", "actors": ["Andr\u00e9 the Giant (Himself)", "Hulk Hogan (Himself)", "Randy Savage (Randy 'Macho Man' Savage)", "Ted DiBiase (Himself)", "Adolph Bresciano (Himself)", "Aurelian Jake Smith Jr. (Jake 'The Snake' Roberts)", "Tonga Fifita (Haku)", "Richard Erwin Rood (Rick Rude)", "The Ultimate Warrior (Himself)", "Bobby Heenan (Himself)", "Bill Eadie (Ax)", "Barry Allen Darsow (Smash)", "Davey Boy Smith (Himself)", "Thomas Billington (The Dynamite Kid)", "Curtis Michael Hennig (Himself)", "James Henry Neidhart (Himself)", "Josip Nikolai Peruzovi\u0107 (Nokolai Volkoff)", "James Edward Duggan Jr ('Hacksaw' Jim Duggan)", "The Honky Tonk Man (The Honky Tonk Man)", "Bret Hart (Himself)", "Edward Harrison Leslie (Brutus Beefcake)", "Ray Fernandez (Hercules)", "Raymond Washington Traylor, Jr. (Big Boss Man)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
