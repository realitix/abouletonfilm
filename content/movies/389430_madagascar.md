Laura is a professor at a shabby, stultifying college. Her daughter, Laurita, stops going to school, wishes to move to Madagascar and quickly races through several phases. One day, she looks like a heavy-metal fan, another like a bohemian who weeps at poetry and art. Slowly, she crosses the line from ordinary adolescent confusion to intense neurosis and beyond, finally becoming so obsessed with religion and good works that she brings 10 homeless children into the cramped house she shares with her mother and grandmother.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jryPBqUSEwm4edJQaF6Xcoy6KBL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
