He's never late for work and nothing interesting ever happens to him. One day everything changes: he oversleeps and is fired as an example, he's then mistaken for evil criminal killer Mannion and is arrested. The resemblance is so striking that the police give him a special pass to avoid a similar mistake. The real Mannion sees the opportunity to steal the pass and move around freely and chaos results.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mUq4dLr9DS7qmccLNwwKe4DJgJt.jpg", "actors": ["Edward G.
