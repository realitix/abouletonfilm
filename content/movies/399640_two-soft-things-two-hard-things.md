The Inuits are indigenous tribes who come from the northern territories of Canada. The word \u201cinuit\u201d means \u201cthe people\u201d in the Inuktitut language. It is commonly believed that homosexuality does not exist in Inuit society, or is a choice, but documentary filmmakers Mark Kenneth Woods and Michael Yerxa aim to prove this untrue in their documentary, Two Soft Things, Two Hard Things. The title for the film comes from the Inuit word for homosexuals. The word for lesbians translates to \u201ctwo soft things rubbing against each other\u201d and the word for gay men means \u201ctwo hard things rubbing against each other.\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2U2MdNIkpofoDeTdvcPg3X80pFB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
