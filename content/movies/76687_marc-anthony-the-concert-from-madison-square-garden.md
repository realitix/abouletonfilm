The dazzled audience erupts at the singer's knockout, Spanish-language openers, \"Y Hubo Alguien\" and \"Contra la Corriente,\" swoons to his exultant \"You Sang to Me,\" and hangs on every marvelous syllable in the exquisitely phrased \"When I Dream at Night.\" Anthony's material occasionally slides into bathos (\"That's Okay\"), but at his best he can go from big band salsa (\"Nadie Como Ella\") to Burt Bacharach-flavored pop-soul (\"My Baby You\") to gorgeous, breathless ballads (\"Da la Vuelta\") without breaking a sweat. But when he needs all engines firing at once, such as on his hot-hot-hot big hit, \"I Need to Know,\" the tension and power are delicious. Watching Anthony work a stadium crowd--gliding, dancing, playing to every corner--reminds one of Mick Jagger's playbook.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eWb8QRQG7MVFwYFmAwjTVnv1YK0.jpg", "actors": ["Marc Anthony (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
