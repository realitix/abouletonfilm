One of my favourites, I only wish it'd be re-issued on Blu-Ray, or at least in an improved format, as the UK DVD transfer is horrible quality. I really can't understand why anyone would give it such harsh ratings though, apart from sour grapes maybe, or just ignorance."}], "recommandations_id": [48894, 45505, 102227]}
