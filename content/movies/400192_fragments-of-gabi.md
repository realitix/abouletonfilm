The film follows her for 36 hours, but we only catch glimpses of what she is actually going through. As the action unfolds, we understand that Gabi is undergoing a silent revolution, trying to free/emancipate herself from her disconnected surroundings. The world of the film is fragmented - it is built on singular vignettes that offer various elements in one scene, stimulating, on and off screen, the imagination and participation of the spectator.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3q2Mna6qF9dzJCAl8VAUx5U4aiy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
