The line-up includes a number of well-known Berliners such as Irene Schweitzer, who runs the shop \u201cKaufhaus Schrill\u201d in Bleibtreustrasse, photographer Erika Rabau and painter Evelyn Sommerhoff. The women talk about their chaotic family backgrounds, dramatic twists and turns, courageous decisions, failed relationships, breakdowns and new beginnings, as well as the art of gritting your teeth in spite of all of life\u2019s blows. In no uncertain terms the women tell the filmmaker how they came to be the people they are; they also chat unabashedly about their sexual antics and reflect en passant on the social climate in Germany.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fufDVLBEHP6AD1FMBsWHhKeNXe2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
