A couple of shots with neon lighting you could have put on your aesthetic blog if the camera quality wasn't so low, and a bad synth score so you know that it's only bad because it's a \"throwback\"(!) but _Hack House_ was poorly received, even in my \"Shitty Horror Only\" household.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing.
