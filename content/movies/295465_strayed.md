The last half hour is about where things actually start happening. But when you have an hour of four people who ALL have cameras, filming in an old bathhouse (reason for all the tile) and you, the viewer, already know that the evil entity is located in one specific place in the building because you were told in the very beginning of the movie, and none of the characters are going to that particular place but instead keep opening door after door to bathrooms that all look the same and have nothing going on in them.... it gets really boring waiting for the last half hour."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
