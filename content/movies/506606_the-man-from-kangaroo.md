He falls in love with Muriel, an orphaned heiress, and discovers that her guardian Martin Giles is embezzling her inheritance. Harland earns the ire of parishioners by teaching young boys to box, and Giles manipulates local opinion to have the bishop remove him. Harland rescues a gentleman from a mugging in Sydney who suggests that he go to Kalmaroo where a criminal gang has driven the church out of the area. Harland preaches, and unexpectedly sees Muriel in the congregation; her property is near Kalmaroo. But her overseer is Red Jack Braggan who leads the gang which violently breaks up Harland's mission - much to the distress of Muriel who regards Harland as too timid - and is in cahoots with Giles.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7Wgf6Wn7gYKtp0RMpKVFEuGiFXQ.jpg", "actors": ["Rex 'Snowy' Baker (John Harland)", "Agnes Vernon (Muriel Hammond)", "Charles Villiers (Martin Giles)", "Wilfred Lucas (Red Jack Braggan)", "Walter Vincent (Ezra Peters)", "Malcolm MacKellar (Foreman)", "David Edelsten ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
