Wilson is an FBI agent, George a mechanic, Phil teaches African-American studies, and Dre's a doctor. They tease and reminisce, mostly about sex; they argue, mostly about racial politics. Then, late on the second night of the trip, they stop at a roadside diner. Phil and a cracker get in a pushing match, and soon fists are flying. The four drive off, but their woes have just begun as they get lost on a county road and the deputy sheriffs get a call to watch for four drug dealers who tried to rob the diner.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fgIhj54CouxzQTC9BDBanhAPpNx.jpg", "actors": ["Andre M.
