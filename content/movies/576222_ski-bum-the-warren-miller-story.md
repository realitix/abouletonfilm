Miller, who died last year at 93, sat months before his passing for his final interview. He reminisced about living off rabbit stew and sleeping in a teardrop trailer in his endless pursuit of the perfect ski run and he explained in great detail the challenges - both personal and professional - he faced over the course of his career.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eL8XaG6xfwsq1EM06JdmRaBxjMx.jpg", "actors": ["Warren Miller (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
