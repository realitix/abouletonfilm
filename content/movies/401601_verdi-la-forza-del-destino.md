He proposes a reflection on war, on vengeance and also on the mark of guilt which ends with the joie de vivre and the expansion of passions. In the intimacy of Calatrava, his is a post-Bauhaus picture of a Fascist neatness which then contrasts with the chaos of battles, the abyss of misery and the sexual stampede after triumph or failure. In this context, religion, instead of being a consolation is both an escape and the tomb of humanity; the chapel wherein Leonora hides is made out of huge crosses and in one of them, just for a moment, Don \u00c1lvaro seems crucified by his fate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/51e4p8jbjgjC0o8gjtiX16hFeMO.jpg", "actors": ["Jonas Kaufmann (Don Alvaro)", "Anja Harteros (Donna Leonora)", "Ludovic T\u00e9zier (Don Carlos de Vargas)", "Nadia Krasteva (Preziosilla)", "Vitalij Kowaljow (Padre Guardiano)", "Renato Girolami (Fra Melitone)", "Heike Gr\u00f6tzinger (Curra)", "Vitalij Kowaljow (Marqu\u00e9s de Calatrava)", "Francesco Petrozzi (Mastro Trabucco)", "Christian Rieger (Alcalde)", "Asher Fisch (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
