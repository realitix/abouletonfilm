Kim Darby plays a 1920s-era debutante who is kidnapped and held for ransom. Her captors are the Grissoms, a family comprised of sadists and morons, and headed by Ma Barker clone Irene Dailey. One of the Grissoms, played by Scott Wilson, takes a liking to his prisoner, which results in a bloody breakdown of the family unit. Both The Grissom Gang and the original No Orchids For Miss Blandish were inspired by the best-seller by James Hadley Chase, though neither film retains Chase's original ending.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sZF3RYY2d3VxEihX5PWn2RnSQl.jpg", "actors": ["Kim Darby (Barbara Blandish)", "Scott Wilson (Slim Grissom)", "Tony Musante (Eddie Hagan)", "Robert Lansing (Dave Fenner)", "Connie Stevens (Anna Borg)", "Wesley Addy (John P.
