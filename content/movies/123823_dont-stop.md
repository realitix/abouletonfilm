The communist regime, in a suffocating atmosphere ruled over by the secret police, imposes \"normalization\". Miki and David need some kind of motivation to carry on in the communist wasteland. They discover The Clash's album 'London Calling' and, of course, decide to set up a punk band. But playing punk during normalization in Czechoslovakia isn't the best idea, an opinion shared not only by their horrified parents. Many decisions made under the influence of cheap alcohol and compulsive music could be more fatal than they initially seemed. A story about the revolt of some 18-year-olds against authority, against social norms, against adult duties and responsibility. It is about the search for one's own models and values. Although based on personal experiences from the early 1980s, it could have taken place at any time and anywhere, and is more than likely taking place somewhere right now.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9u7aZx33OWo9CwvhozLncdRq7sr.jpg", "actors": ["Patrik D\u011brgel (Miki)", "Luk\u00e1\u0161 Reichl (Dejvid)", "Jakub Zedn\u00ed\u010dek (Viktor aka Vicious)", "Oliver Cox (Inza)", "Ji\u0159\u00ed Kocman (M\u00e1rty)", "Viola \u010cernodrinsk\u00e1 (Pavla)", "Krist\u00edna Svarinsk\u00e1 (Val\u00e9rie)", "Kl\u00e1ra Pollertov\u00e1 (matka Mikiho)", "Ji\u0159\u00ed \u0160tr\u00e9bl (otec Mikiho)", "Tom\u00e1\u0161 Diani\u0161ka (Iggy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "mn8VhxVVtaE"}
