Then it's on to Oxford. First there's a survey of some of the town's rich architecture, with a look at New College, Magdalen College, the university church, and central theatre. The recent history of women students is summarized. We visit Eton, noticing the formal wear of its privileged students, then it's on to King's College for a history lesson. The Traveltalk concludes with boating on the Thames.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bxpMGe6jVrjlftBA2PXwYsHm9mi.jpg", "actors": ["James A.
