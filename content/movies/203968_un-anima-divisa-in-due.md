Pietro De Leo (Fabrizio Bentivoglio), a store security guard, spends his days catching shoplifters, his weekends visiting his children who are in the custody of his ex-wife, and his evenings thinking about how to flirt some more with the store's makeup consultant. One day, he sees a young Gypsy girl (Maria Bako) lift something from his store, but is so taken with her that he lets it slide. He even testifies on her behalf when she comes to court for a hearing on another matter. Indeed, he is so taken with her that he wants to marry her, gypsy-style. He has a great deal of difficulty bringing off the kidnapping, but finally accomplishes this and the subsequent wedding. He moves to the south of Italy and starts a new life with her as a truck driver while she gets legit jobs as a hotel maid and at a factory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y7EWPIunf0PCLhG7kilNj94yWXK.jpg", "actors": ["Fabrizio Bentivoglio (Pietro Di Leo)", "Felice Andreasi ()", "Giuseppe Battiston ()", "Giuseppe Cederna ()", "Vitalba Andrea ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
