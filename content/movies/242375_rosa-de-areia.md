The film\u2019s collage structure gathers texts from multiple sources \u2013 including Kafka and Montaigne \u2013 and crafts a world of theatrical artifice far from the documentary inspired naturalism of Ana and Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes. Reis and Cordeiro\u2019s least known film has lingered in obscurity and never recovered from the unfairly negative reviews that resulted in its severely limited release. Reis died less than two years later, just as he and Cordeiro were about to begin an ambitious adaptation of Juan Rulfo\u2019s Pedro Par\u00e1mo. - Harvard Film Archive", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e5SSN75a5xmQ7kiWadzIjDKn3QL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
