According to the legend, he robbed nobles and gave the loot to the poor. The legend were also known in neighboring Silesia, the Margraviate of Moravia and later spread to the Kingdom of Bohemia. The actual robber had little to do with the modern legend, whose content partly reflects the ubiquitous folk myths of a hero taking from the rich and giving to the poor. However, the legend was also shaped in important ways by the activists and writers in the 19th century when J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk became the key highwayman character in stories that spread in the north counties of the Kingdom of Hungary (present Slovakia) and among the local Gorals and Polish tourists in the Podhale region north of the Tatras.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2Pk3ngcio5PWIlVgJjQHrxB981c.jpg", "actors": ["Pa\u013eo Bielik (J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk)", "Zlata Hajd\u00fakov\u00e1 (Anka)", "Andrej Bagar (\u0160\u00e1ndor)", "Theodor Pi\u0161t\u011bk (Andre Marku\u0161ovsk\u00fd)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
