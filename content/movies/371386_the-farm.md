The farm is apparently inhabited by only one man, a 20 year old called John. John is cripplingly shy, but seems to be fascinated by Juliet's beauty, with the feeling not exactly unrequited. As Juliet and John forge more and more of a bond, Mickey, already expecting the gang to appear and kill him at any moment, becomes overcome with jealousy and paranoia. Gradually the three characters find themselves sucked into a deadly love triangle from which they may never emerge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2K5LVqwDBYIVkS9KWGSJGHDsQfd.jpg", "actors": ["Louise Cargin (Juliet)", "Robert D.
