Alli Coates filmed performance artist Signe Pierce as she strutted down a busy oceanside street in stripper garb and a reflective mask. The pair agreed not to communicate until the experiment was completed, but never anticipated the horror that would unfold in under an hour.  The result is a heart wrenching technicolor spectacle that raises questions about gender stereotypes, mob mentality, and violence in America.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cim4x5AC2xrhFTyzP3tFvHZ342Q.jpg", "actors": ["Signe Pierce ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
