He is drafted into the A.E.F. when World War I breaks out, and accidentally captures a nest of German snipers, and is decorated for bravery. He returns home as a hero but Vance, the town bully, challenges him to a fight but Barry refuses and the townsmen mock him and consider him a coward. His girlfriend Janet is none too impressed, either. He heads for the tall timber with suicide as his intent.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zcvQxUDbxOgSz7Lb8EhCQqNBydg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
