Even in this early comedy her natural fun comes through. The one she really loves is clumsy yokel Ford Sterling, who is determined to buy an oil well that the con man has for sale. The conman gets a local fellow to pour oil over the property. Ford falls for it and buys it - Mabel and he are to be married. Then the fellow confesses that it was just a scam - there was no oil.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Ford Sterling (Oil Well Buyer)", "Mabel Normand (Oil Well Buyer's Sweetheart)", "Charles Inslee (Con Man)", "Bert Hunn (1st Henchman)", "Hank Mann (2nd Henchman)", "Mack Swain (Villager / Cop)", "Charles Avery (Man at Oil Well (uncredited))", "Dot Farley (Party Guest (uncredited))", "William Hauber (Party Guest / Cop (uncredited))", "George Jeske (Money Lender (uncredited))", "Edgar Kennedy (Cop (uncredited))", "Rube Miller (Villager (uncredited))", "Peggy Pearce (Party Guest (uncredited))", "Harry Russell (Villager (uncredited))", "Mai Wells (Party Guest (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
