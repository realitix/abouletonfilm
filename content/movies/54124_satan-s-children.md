But Bobby proves to be one sick puppy, which he demonstrates in ways that would even make the devil smile. So hilarious, homophobic, and just plain insane, you'd think Lucifer himself was personally involved!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/brVI4JPiVJ3Wm52aN1j3QRT3uZA.jpg", "actors": ["Stephen White (Bobby Douglas)", "Eldon Mecham (Mr. Douglas)", "Joyce Molloy (Janice Douglas)", "Kathleen Marie Archer (Sherry)", "Rosemary Orlando (Monica)", "Bob Barbour (Jake)", "Robert C.
