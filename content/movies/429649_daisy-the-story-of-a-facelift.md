In an act of completely typical chutzpah, his project here is to film the facelift of his boss, middle-aged NFB producer Daisy Bellefeuille.  He follows the process through her discussions with her friends, consultations with physicians, observation of other facelift patients, and finally the operation and its aftermath.  There's also a typical amateur-intellectual sidebar on the history of physical appearance and its cultural importance that is quite fascinating.  Altogether, a gripping hour-long film that ranges from intellectually curious to Health-&amp;-Style gossipy to momentarily horrifying (some of the medical sequences).  I seem to recall from seeing the film when it first came out that there were more explicit sequences of Daisy's own operation that seem not to be there anymore, but that could just be my imagination.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
