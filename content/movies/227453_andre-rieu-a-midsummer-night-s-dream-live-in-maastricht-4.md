Andr\u00e9 invited the South African soloists from the tour to take part in this summer\u2019s Vrijthof concerts: the fantastic young soprano Kimmy Skota from Cape Town, the Bloemfontein Children\u2019s Choir and the children from the Hout Bay Music Project provided a real South African atmosphere.  This fabulous summer evening concert also featured the sopranos Mirusia Louwerse and Carmen Monarcha, the Platinum Tenors and the Berlin Comedian Harmonists.  The evening has an upbeat end with a guest appearance from DJ \u00d6tzi.  This is a truly fantastic concert that you really can\u2019t miss!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7aJOyLe8KBAu4nsiyQbEdlFkZHL.jpg", "actors": ["Andr\u00e9 Rieu ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
