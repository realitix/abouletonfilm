Driving to a gig one night, after a short but extremely sweet visit with Teri, Michael is run off the road and killed. An end to a beautiful relationship...or is it? Two months later, just when Teri begins to resume her life (and love life). Michael returns...as a ghost. His attempts to win her back lead him to a variety of sensuous situations, such as: lending a helping hand to two female tennis players in the massage room, giving Teri's roommate a wet dream she'll never forget, and making the hottest dominatrix in town do her unnatural best for his closest friend.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4HABgbXrpsxnjRppxrSc7aFtr3B.jpg", "actors": ["Ginger Lynn Allen ()", "Bridgette Monet ()", "Misty Regan ()", "Desiree Lane ()", "Kimberly Carson ()", "Tanya Lawson ()", "Ron Jeremy ()", "John Leslie ()", "Eric Edwards ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
