With the flair of a seasoned raconteur, Leacock recounts key moments in his seventy years as a filmmaker and the innovations that he, D.A. Pennebaker, Albert Maysles and others invented that revolutionized documentary filmmaking, and explores the mystery of creativity. With the passing of both Blank and Leacock, the documentary is a moving insight into the lives of two seminal figures in the history of film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fgFZMwSlvQ9FW6hlRVPaisa4A4w.jpg", "actors": ["Ricky Leacock (Himself)", "Les Blank (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
