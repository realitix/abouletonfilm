Uber weird. \r\n\r\nMore twist and turns than the highway itself :P\r\n\r\nFor sure it's fun to try and nail down exactly what happened but IMHO it's a little more fun not to know - each time you rewatch it you might see/think/feel something different."}], "recommandations_id": [793, 483, 1730, 985], "youtube_key": "r757aSgW0tg"}
