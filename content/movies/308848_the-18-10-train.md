He makes it through to the last round with the arrogant yuppie Alex. The younger and self-assured Alex seems to have a better chance of getting the job and Onno will not tolerate that. A few days before the last interview, he kidnaps his opponent and locks him up in a remote cottage that his girlfriend has just inherited near a railway line. As soon as he gets the job, he releases his victim. Three years later - Onno now lives together and has a son - he is a successful curator at the Rijksmuseum and needs an assistant. While interviewing applicants, he is confronted with Alex, now blind in one eye.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Peter Paul Muller ()", "Roeland Fernhout ()", "Rifka Lodeizen ()", "Halina Reijn ()", "Rudolf Lucieer ()", "Marnie Blok ()", "Jordy Krant ()", "Gwen Eckhaus ()", "Leopold Witte ()", "Hugo Koolschijn ()", "Alwien Tulner ()", "Diederik Ebbinge ()", "Khaldoun Elmecky ()", "Rodney Beddal ()", "Rinco van der Baan ()", "Leo Hogenboom ()", "Babette Mulder ()", "Harpert Michielsen ()", "Harmen Siezen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
