In this film, the landscape is scarred by absence rather than presence. Bogs, positioned on the margins of society, have long served as sites for the disposal of bodies and the concealment of crime. Here, elusive traces of destruction and the memories of human trauma remain embedded in the landscape.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
