The atmosphere of the performance is great, with the bands and fans coming together after Richey's disappearance to create a wonderful, tense, sad and beautiful mood. Musically the Manics rock out with excellent versions of 7 of their best songs to date when the video was made and 6 tracks from the aforementioned then-new album, with Elvis Impersonator and No Surface All Feeling the picks of these.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fb24AvTfILVK23fui9xXW5jtbZI.jpg", "actors": ["Manic Street Preachers (Themselves)", "James Dean Bradfield (Himself)", "Nicky Wire (Himself)", "Sean Moore (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
