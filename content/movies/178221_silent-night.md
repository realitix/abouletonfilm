His passion to bring the church closer to the common people sets him on a collision course with his new superior, Father Nostler. When Mohr organizes a church choir that includes outcasts from the local tavern and performs in German instead of Latin, Nostler threatens him with disciplinary action. Their relationship further deteriorates when Maria a regular tavern patron, surprisingly joins the performance of the all-male church choir. As Mohr's initial successes start to crumble and his efforts backfire on him, he loses all hope and faces a trial of faith. The night before Christmas, Mohr has to decide if he will accept defeat and leave Oberndorf or embrace the true significance of the Holy Night.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tW1HHNzcN3mZYrybNKz1yz4K71y.jpg", "actors": ["Carsten Clemens (Joseph Mohr)", "Markus von Lingen (Franz Gruber)", "Janina Elkin (Maria)", "Alexander E.
