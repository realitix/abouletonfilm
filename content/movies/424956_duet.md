Hamed has pursued his passion for music, he has recently released his first album and has been married for a year with a music instructor, Minoo. Sepideh has become an English teacher for preschoolers and is now wed to a builder, Massoud, who ironically can\u2019t seem to build a solid marriage. In spite of everything, Hamed hasn\u2019t forgotten about Sepideh yet and, when she goes back to their hometown, Minoo encourages her husband to meet her and clear his mind about what he really wants. With the collusion of a long time friend who owns a stationer, Hamed orchestrates an accidental meeting with Sepideh, in the attempt to find out more about her current life and, at the same time, to put himself to test.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oq5Rigv2msqYUNMRFHGwvZgHbxx.jpg", "actors": ["Ali Mosaffa (h)", "Ali Mosaffa (-)", "Morteza Farshbaf (-)", "Alireza Aghakhani (-)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
