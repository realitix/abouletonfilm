Valery Gergiev\u2019s idiomatic and authoritative conducting inspires a superb cast, headed by Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (Ghermann), breathtaking in his portrayal of a man unraveling toward suicide. Galina Gorchakova is Lisa, the woman he loves and destroys, Dmitri Hvorostovsky lends a superb voice and regal bearing to Prince Yeletsky; and Elisabeth S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m is hair-raising as the old Countess. Olga Borodina is Paulina and Nikolai Putilin is Count Tomsky.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8OgzlkgMMYeziixvcmgnJVvvUNe.jpg", "actors": ["Galina Gorchakova ()", "Dmitri Hvorostovsky ()", "Pl\u00e1cido Domingo ()", "Elisabeth S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m ()", "Nikolai Putilin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
