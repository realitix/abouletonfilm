Tracing the origins of his work, American painter Fonseca reveals that his singular forms are not merely summoned from the imagination, but are also inherited from a deep and personal lineage of artists. Through his humor and self-examination, Fonseca shows us that colors and forms can reveal a man's history and character, reminding us that the work of an artist is not simply a reflection of life, but the essence of life.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
