Set in an irrational, poetic universe that bears a certain relationship to Jacques Rivette\u2019s DUELLE, this dreamy intrigue breaks a cardinal rule of fantasy by striking off in a number of directions: an executive barks in the street, a young Frenchwoman (Magnuson) loses her hair, and machines in a copy shop start to purr and wheeze on their own initiative. The moods that are established are delicate, and not everyone will be able to go with them, but Driver sustains them with beauty and eccentric charm.\u201d \u2013Jonathan Rosenbaum, CHICAGO READER", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9BaGbw7aQ8IBKNTpNzcs6lEYv5y.jpg", "actors": ["Suzanne Fletcher (Nicole)", "Steve Buscemi (Worker)", "Ann Magnuson (Isabelle)", "Tony Todd (Barrington)", "Stephen Chen (Dr. Gou)", "Dexter Lee (Jimmy)", "Richard Boes (The Thief)", "Ako ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
