As an extension of Moreau\u2019s images of Salome, the project considers gestural control sound design based on \u201cstriking\u201d and \u201cbowing\u201d movements, and how these might operate as metaphors by mapping gestures with strong physical associations to sound and rhythm modules specifically designed to represent them. Apparition also investigates music and visuals in the form of a contemporary \u201ccomposed novel\u201d, exploring the syntax of found footage, pattern, texture, colour, text, gesture and electroacoustic composition.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
