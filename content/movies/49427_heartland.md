This semi-documentary slice of life is based on the diaries of Elmore Randall Stewart about her days on the Wyoming frontier in the early 20th century. It's a strongly feminist statement about a woman raising her small daughter alone and scrapping for a living by working for a shy Scottish rancher. Director Richard Pearce brings an endearing touch to a film that is helped greatly by the dazzling cinematography of Fred Murphy. Conchata Ferrell and Rip Torn star in this small film that substitutes veracity for a high-powered plot.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nA7cD1uegeo6KZe8lVejthDnq16.jpg", "actors": ["Rip Torn (Clyde Stewart)", "Conchata Ferrell (Elinore Randall Stewart)", "Barry Primus (Jack)", "Megan Folsom (Jerrine)", "Lilia Skala (Mrs. Landauer)", "Amy Wright (Clara Jane)", "Jerry Hardin (Cattlebuyer)", "Mary Boylan (Ma Gillis)", "Bob Sirucek (Dan Byrd)", "Marvin Berg (Justice of the Peace)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [95764, 42221, 41386, 47019], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
