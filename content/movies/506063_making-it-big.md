Our story begins with a young country girl named Cherry who has won a scholarship in the DuMar Manor School of Acting. She is informed their training method may be a little unusual but has proven to be highly effective. Cherry gets intimate lessons from several \"instructors\" on proper technique. She soon realizes the only way to beat out her arch rival Liz is to challenge her to a one-on-one competition during an audition for Hollywood's biggest, richest, movie producer. The winner will literally be MAKING IT BIG!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jody Swafford ()", "Jacqueline Lorians ()", "Shaun Michelle ()", "Desiree Lane ()", "Blake Palmer ()", "Herschel Savage ()", "Marc Wallice ()", "Paul Thomas ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
