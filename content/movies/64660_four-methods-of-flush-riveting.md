In aircraft construction, a flush rivet reduces drag, thus increasing aircraft performance. This World War II-era Walt Disney industrial-training film teaches four methods of flush-riveting aircraft aluminum sheet metal: the Countersink method, the Double Dimple method, the Pre-Dimple method, and the Combination Pre-Dimple and Countersink method. The choice of method to use is based upon the thicknesses of the top and bottom metal sheets.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y7balJMmzUUI1qBGvjJakr3RWtD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
