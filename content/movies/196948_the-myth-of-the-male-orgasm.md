In the story, Jimmy (Bruce Dinsmore) is having a mid-life crisis, and in order to get a handle on why he has so much trouble with women, decides to participate in a college-sponsored study on male sexuality. What he doesn't know is that the study is being run by some extremely radical, doctrinaire feminists, and that he's in for a nightmarish grilling. He shows up for his first sessions, is blindfolded, and is then put through his paces as a relentless female interrogator puts him constantly on the defensive for everything he has ever done with women throughout his entire life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q90KiEJx0wodwpqjG85QKwwwqF2.jpg", "actors": ["Bruce Dinsmore (Jimmy Rovinsky)", "Miranda de Pencier (Jane Doe)", "Mark Camacho (Tim)", "Burke Lawrence (Sean)", "Macha Grenon (Paula)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
