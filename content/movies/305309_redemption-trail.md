The daughter of a murdered Black Panther revolutionary, Tess, (Hamilton) lives off the grid on a Sonoma vineyard, fiercely detached from all connections. Her hermetic life cracks when she gives reluctant shelter to a desperate young woman, Anna (Rabe) who has attempted suicide in a nearby forest. An unlikely alliance forms between the two, where other close relationships have failed -- David, Anna's husband, (Linklater) and John, Tess' employer (Weber), cannot break through their walls. But the very difference between the two women opens them up to a new vision of themselves, as not only survivors, but as heroes capable even of a thrilling shoot-out in the name of outlaw justice. Reclaiming freedom, and life, they plunge forward, towards an unknown, transformative horizon.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aIHHmgznSeSsNSV3JHQBvV3mEny.jpg", "actors": ["Lily Rabe (Anna)", "LisaGay Hamilton (Tess)", "Jake Weber (John)", "Hamish Linklater (David)", "Beth Lisick (Larraine)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
