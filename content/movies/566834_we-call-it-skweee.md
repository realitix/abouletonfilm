During his stay in Sweden he got in touch with the Scandinavian electro style known as Skweee and some of its practicians. Active in the Neapolitan Dubstep scene, Iacopo became fascinated with the music as well as the determination and individuality of the artists involved. He decided to follow some of the central Skweee artists with his camera for a year. The trip went from the Stockholm suburbs over Helsinki, Finland and all the way to Spain and Barcelona's Sonar festival, where eight Swedish and Finnish artists had been invited to represent the scene. \"We call it Skweee is a foreigner's view on a culture form that in many ways mirrors what I understand as typically Scandinavian\", says Iacopo.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Randy Barracuda ()", "Rigas den Andre ()", "Eero Johannes ()", "Joxaren ()", "Pavan ()", "Daniel Savio ()", "Mesak ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
