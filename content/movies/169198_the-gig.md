Trombonist Wayne Rogers is a used-car dealer; drummer Daniel Nalbach is a mother-dominated dentist; clarinetist Jerry Matz is a somewhat self-centered music teacher; trumpeter Warren Vache could have been a professional musician, but opted for a socially convenient wealthy marriage; and bass violinist Stan Lachow prefers to keep to himself the rest of the week. What happens to this informal aggregation when the opportunity arises for a paying gig at a Catskills resort forms the heart of this picture. Dissention in the ranks comes about when Lachow can't make the engagement, and is replaced by veteran musician Cleavon Little, who is disdainful of being surrounded by amateurs. The Gig is a model \"small\" picture, a clear labor of love for writer/ director Frank D. Gilroy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5BsO3xOKj7pdPDMi3Q9PIbXnvPY.jpg", "actors": ["Wayne Rogers (Marty Flynn)", "Cleavon Little (Marshall WIlson)", "Jerry Matz (Aaron Wohl)", "Daniel Nalbach (Arthur Winslow)", "Warren Vach\u00e9 (Gil Macrae)", "Joe Silver (Abe Mitgang)", "Jay Thomas (Rick Valentine)", "Stan Lachow (George Pappas)", "Celia Bressack (Lucy)", "Georgia Harrell (The Blonde)", "Michael Fischetti (Vincent Amatri)", "Susan Egbert (Laura Macrae)", "Karen Ashley (Janet Larmon)", "Virginia Downing (Mrs. Winslow)", "Virginia Downing (The Driver)", "Annie Korzen (Miss Gresh)", "Nancy Parker ()", "Nancy Parker (Director)", "Nancy Parker (Arthur's Patient)", "Ed Stevlingson (Mr. Oglivie)", "Andrew Duncan (Jack Larmon)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
