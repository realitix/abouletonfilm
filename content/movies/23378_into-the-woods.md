Anyone who loves fairy tails should not pass up this movie. It's a witty merging of some of the most known tales of Cinderella, Rapunzel, Jack and the Beanstalk, and Little Red Riding Hood. Be aware they are based off of the real Grimm fairy tales, and the second half is AFTER the Happily Ever After. It is a comedy satire but with a lot of charm and heart and some thoughts to reflect on. The music, dialogue, and characters are among my favorite. This is a filmed broadway production of the original cast and it's hard for me to imagine anyone else in their roles."}], "recommandations_id": [31020, 92968, 47446, 92965]}
