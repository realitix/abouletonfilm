The Germans take a group of hostages through the village and on their way molest a small boy. As revenge the boy sets the German corn on fire. An intelligent and shrewd Gestapo officer Sicer arrives to investigate. He does not even suspect that he is up against a group of small boys, led by Milan and Vaso, and orders that all men from the village be taken to custody. He announces that one man will be shot each day unless the real culprit steps forward. Children contact the partisans.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nH2e4QtPp745Jl7DjfVIkqoZAhH.jpg", "actors": ["Slavko \u0160timac (Milan Maljevi\u0107)", "Miodrag Radovanovi\u0107 (\u0160icer)", "Pavle Vuisi\u0107 (Paja)", "Renata Ulmanski (Majka)", "Miroljub Le\u0161o (Pera)", "Ljubomir \u017divanovi\u0107 (Vasa)", "Milan Kuruzovi\u0107 (Branko)", "Slobodan Velimirovi\u0107 (Ri\u0111i)", "Vojin Kajgani\u0107 (Sep)", "Dragoljub Milosavljevi\u0107 'Gula' (Velja)", "Ivan Jagodi\u0107 (Plavi paor)", "Stole Aran\u0111elovi\u0107 (Skeled\u017eija)", "Bo\u017eidar Pavi\u0107evi\u0107 'Longa' (\u0160uca)", "Danilo 'Bata' Stojkovi\u0107 (Damnjan)", "Danilo \u010coli\u0107 (Komandant)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
