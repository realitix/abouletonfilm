Meg decides she wants to have a baby, a goal that initially makes Duffy frantic, but soon becomes his most important desire as well. When they are unable to have a baby, Meg begins concentrating on her career and the two slowly drift apart -- eventually separating. Later, when Duffy is speaking at a convention of the Delta Gamma sorority, he reveals that the Delta Gamma girls have always been his dream girls -- his Love Goddesses. There he meets the young and uninhibited Delta Gamma girl, Daphne Delillo. When Daphne moves to New York to work as a network sports reporter, their mutual attraction and Daphne's spontaneity spark an adventurous new relationship for Duffy. Now Duffy must decide which is more valuable to him -- the relationship he has given up, or the relationship he has always dreamed of having.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pe5TahkiQkBG0jMf4ZbzjgyKznP.jpg", "actors": ["Gene Wilder (Duffy Bergman)", "Christine Lahti (Meg Lloyd Bergman)", "Mary Stuart Masterson (Daphne)", "Robert Prosky (Emile Thomas \"E.T.\" Bergman)", "Stephen Tobolowsky (Hugo)", "Wendie Malick (Nancy)", "Anne Jackson (Adele Bergman)", "Susan Ruttan (Claire Raskin)", "Freda Foh Shen (Nurse)", "David Margulies (Dr. Benjamin)", "Regis Philbin (Regis Philbin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [118991, 42176, 32035, 58028], "youtube_key": "G_VaFbyHdP0"}
