Kat\u014d Tateo of the Imperial Japanese Army-Air Corps trains new volunteers from the Army's Infantry to become Japan's next generation of fighter pilots at the Tokorozawa Flying School. Flying Kawasaki Ko-4 biplanes, Lt. Kat\u014d will train both friend and future foe alike. But as war in China breaks out, Kat\u014d now in command of the 5th Rentai will take his untested men flying antiquated planes into aerial combat against the Chinese Air Force who is now headed by Lt. Cho who Kat\u014d both earlier befriended and personally trained himself. While Kat\u014d's squadron ultimately achieves air superiority over the skies of Manchuria, it comes at a high price in men to which each loss carries a heavy burden that he alone must carry. As the war widens into the Second World War, Captain Kat\u014d must battle an ever advancing array of deadlier new enemies flying ever more modern fighter planes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aOcSVpIk89KJ2VtBRFa2e08oE6r.jpg", "actors": ["Makoto Sat\u014d ()", "Kojiro Hongo ()", "Ken Utsui ()", "Jun Fujimaki ()", "Shiho Fujimura ()", "Yoko Namikawa ()", "T\u00f4ru Minegishi ()", "Akio Hasegawa ()", "Shigeru Tsuyuguchi ()", "Kenjiro Ishiyama ()", "Bontar\u00f4 Miake ()", "Yoshir\u00f4 Kitahara ()", "Takashi Nakamura ()", "Osamu \u00d4kawa ()", "Koichi Uenoyama ()", "Jutar\u00f4 Hojo ()", "Susumu Fujita ()", "Sh\u00f4go Shimada ()", "Y\u00fbz\u00f4 Hayakawa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
