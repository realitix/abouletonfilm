The threesome is terribly modern about the situation, and Marcia will gladly divorce Roger if Cynthia agrees to a financial settlement. But Cynthia's wealth is in jeopardy because her trust fund will expire if she is not married by a certain date. To satisfy that condition, Cynthia arranges to marry Hagon Derk, who is condemned to die for a crime he didn't commit. She pays him so he can provide for his little sister. But at the last minute, Derk is freed when the true criminal is discovered. Expecting to be a rich widow, Cynthia finds herself married to a man she doesn't know and doesn't want to.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qurM18DVQDRWzuhv8jfxx2z9U56.jpg", "actors": ["Conrad Nagel (Roger Towne)", "Kay Johnson (Cynthia Crothers)", "Julia Faye (Marcia Towne)", "Joel McCrea (Marco)", "Charles Bickford (Hagon Derk)", "Muriel McCormac (Katie Derk)", "Russ Columbo (Singing Mexican Prisoner (uncredited))", "Anita Garvin (Undetermined Role (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
