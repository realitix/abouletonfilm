Schuks Tshabalala is a teacher and tour guide to a mixed bag of tourists who are taking his survival guide to SA very seriously. Shorty, as usual, is his best friend, assistant and conscience. The students include \u201dHeinz\u201d from Germany, \u201cYoti\u201d from Greece, \u201cJean-Pierre\u201d from France, \u201cKoert\u201d from The Netherlands, \u201cRajin\u201d from India, \u201cMaggie\u201d from Ireland and \u201cXing Xang\u201d from China, among others. They are genuinely eager to learn about SA, so Schuks and Shorty are only too happy to oblige.
