After being fired by his father, arguing with his girlfriend in front of their daughter, and then a visit to the local pub, Eli decides to get out of town. On a lonely mountain highway Eli misses a turn and careens over an embankment, landing deep in the forest. It is a place of mystery with no way out, but it is there where God works on his heart. Satan is not far behind of course, working to convince Eli to take a different path. In the end Eli is faced with a choice that will have repercussions on generations as his destiny is to be the Billy Graham of his time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oQXsoZ4c0fRf9wetkHrOUbdv1h6.jpg", "actors": ["Holden Goyette (Young Eli)", "Adam Elliott Davis (Eli Isaacson)", "Graham Greene (Gabe)", "John Lewis (Ranger Haase)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
