In the 1970s, such \"festivals\" were incredibly popular in Brazil. They were recorded before a live studio audience, and usually featured a number of elimination rounds. They also formed the springboard for the career of many a big-name star, such as Chico Buarque, Caetano Veloso, Roberto Carlos and Gilberto Gil. Appearing on such a program was no cakewalk, however: audiences could be as wild in their condemnation as in their appreciation of an artist. Extensive archive footage (including performances and behind-the-scenes interviews) from a turbulent final of the Festival of Brazilian Popular Music one evening in 1967 paints a fascinating picture, not only of the transformation of Brazilian music into real \"festival\" music, but also of a society starting to buck against the yoke of military rule.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nBYqp2NbqYFWPtnldz9Qn580QUC.jpg", "actors": ["Caetano Veloso (Himself)", "S\u00e9rgio Ricardo (Himself)", "Gilberto Gil (Himself)", "Chico Buarque (Himself)", "Edu Lobo (Himself)", "Roberto Carlos (Himself)", "Rita Lee (Herself)", "Arnaldo Baptista (Himself)", "Solano Ribeiro (Himself)", "Zuza Homem de Mello (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
