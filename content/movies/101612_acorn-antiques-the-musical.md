The triumphant West End production brought together Julie Walters (Mrs Overall), Celia Imrie (Miss Babs) and Duncan Preston (Mr Clifford) - the original cast of the series.  It was directed by Sir Trevor Nunn (\"Les Miserables\", \"Woman in White\", \"Starlight Express\") and written by Julie's understudy, the award-winning Victoria Wood.
