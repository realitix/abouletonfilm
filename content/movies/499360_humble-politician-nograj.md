The film sees him and his faithful secretary Monjunath try and climb the political ladder - after all his dreams are to become the President of the USA one day. With a mismatch in morals and aspirations, Nograj lives in his own paradise, with friends, foes and family (all mostly caricatures) to entertain him and keep him on his toes. When an honest NRI Arun Patil decides to set things right and contest against him, Nograj has a new battle on his cards. Will he emerge victorious?"}], "recommandations_id": []}
