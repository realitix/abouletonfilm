Based on his popular play Rafta, Rafta (itself inspired by Bill Naughtons 1960s classic All in Good Time), the film is set in Bolton where Atul and Vina are celebrating their marriage. However, a honeymoon spent with his parents was not part of their plans. Thoughtless patriarch Eeshwar seems determined to emasculate and embarrass his son. As the weeks pass, consummating their union becomes an impossibility that threatens the couples entire future. A breezy mixture of heartbreak and hilarity, All in Good Time also offers peerless performances from original stage stars Harish Patel and Meera Syal.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pou8sPI9A9ubVNorMiwxMwhDKW9.jpg", "actors": ["Amara Karan (Vina)", "Reece Ritchie (Atul)", "Harish Patel (Eeshwar)", "Meera Syal (Lopa)", "Hassani Shapi (Laxman Patel)", "Neet Mohan (Jay Dutt)", "Shaheen Khan (Lata Patel)", "Shelley King (Auntie Laxmi)", "Sudha Bhuchar (Auntie Nushie)", "Rani Moorthy (Auntie Sudha)", "Arsher Ali (Etash)", "Christine Bottomley (Molly Batt)", "Simon Nagra (Jivaj Batt)", "Ozzie Yue (Mr Dinesh)", "Ramrik Bhatt (Priest)", "Jonathan Jaynes (Man at Airport)", "Sue Vincent (Women at Airport)", "Amith Rahman (Young Brijesh)", "Aliyza Shahi (Young Lopa)", "Vikas Nair (Young Eeshwar)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Aub3lEjABuo"}
