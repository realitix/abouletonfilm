She's a meter maid in Tours, working in the rain, subject to verbal abuse from those she cites. Her husband Patrick is consumed by the work of finishing their new house: carpet, tile, faucets. He's also a hothead, subjecting Sonange to tantrums. While she's often quiet and withdrawn, she longs to be a singer. When by chance she meets Myl\u00e8ne, an accomplished, beautiful Parisian writer she admires, Solange gives her a demo tape. Myl\u00e8ne is encouraging, a friendship of sorts develops, and when Solange despairs after a series of personal, emotional setbacks, she heads for Myl\u00e8ne's doorstep in Paris. Does a singing career await, and what about Patrick?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4d2zN3YSSpP5Vbmi3fE74d5L2VD.jpg", "actors": ["Florence Vignon (Solange)", "Mathilde Seigner (Myl\u00e8ne)", "Antoine Chappey (Patrick Rouault)", "Philippe Duquesne (Jean-Paul)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
