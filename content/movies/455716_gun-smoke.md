Before long, Darvas figures the town is ripe for the taking and sends word for reinforcements, and each arriving train unloads a few suits and snappy-brim hats.Then they get rough, kill Sheriff Posey Meed and rile up the citizens, led by cowhand Brad Farley, who had Darvas spotted for a wrong number just by the way he made moves on Sue Vancey.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7q43agwSZ9xTsMyjXPgo8awjB3m.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Arlen (Brad Farley)", "Mary Brian (Sue Vancey)", "William 'Stage' Boyd (Kedge Darvis)", "Eugene Pallette (Stub Wallack)", "Charles Winninger (Tack Gillup)", "Louise Fazenda (Hampsey Dell)", "Brooks Benedict (Spot Skee)", "William Arnold (Mugs Maransa)", "J.
