Brief glimpses of family, friends, girl-friends, the City, seasons of the year, travels. Occasionally I talk, reminisce, or play music I taped during those earlier years, plus more recent piano improvisations by Auguste Varkalis. It's a kind of autobiographical, diaristic poem, celebration of happiness and life. I consider myself a happy man.\" - Jonas Mekas", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3aM4e5AhjX3HAWGz9YqFlYfDIVl.jpg", "actors": ["Jonas Mekas (Jonas Mekas)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "xGUt_4F2SRM"}
