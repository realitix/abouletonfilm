They swing their picks in a coordinated, rhythmic way, thereby creating a sequence of rings, when they hit the stones or the rail, which sounds almost as music. When a train passes by, they stand silent beside the rail for a while, and then start the rhythmic beats again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4amn7DdFP2QD21BOelYonQFG3uQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
