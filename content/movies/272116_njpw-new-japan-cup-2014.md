Originally intended for every April, it was rescheduled to March in 2007. Though NJPW also runs the annual G1 Climax tournament, the NJC is different in that it is single-elimination, whereas the G1 is a round-robin. Like the G1 however, the winner of the tournament receives a shot at the IWGP Heavyweight Championship; this stipulation was added in 2006. In 2014, the winner was given the right to choose whether to challenge for the IWGP Heavyweight or the IWGP Intercontinental Championship.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jTNKwEAixQHCzWH77rVMjtybSgh.jpg", "actors": ["Shinsuke Nakamura ()", "Fale Simitaitoko (Bad Luck Fale)", "Shelton Benjamin ()", "Minoru Suzuki ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
