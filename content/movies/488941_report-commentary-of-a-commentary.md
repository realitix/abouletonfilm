The film consists of 4-5 basic motifs that repeat themselves in cyclic montage. Television images of politicians, ecclesiastical dignitaries, the East German army, military combat jets, and wrecking balls are cut against each other, underlaid with martial industrial music. Again and again, an image is faded in of a woman exposing her breasts.  Originally created as accompaniment to a theatrical staging of Shakespeare's tragedy \"Titus Andronicus\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7tJCWXNcpEmCkpos4vBr9N8EJms.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
