While some achieved their dreams of stardom, others ended up in independently produced short films in which these nubile would-be actresses were asked to throw their modesty - and clothes - to the wind.  These movies were meant to catch the modern woman in her most private moments - performing household chores, dancing to the latest twist record, or working on her tan - all of which, it seems, was better done in the nude.  Though the names of the women featured in this collection are lost to history, their sensual allure is still apparent today.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
