Originally conceived as a spy thriller with socio-political overtones, Shadowcrack quickly assumed the form of an outline for a series of Vaudeo\u2122 vignettes with partially overlapping plots to be developed in the near future. The Vaudeo\u2122 concept denies the superficial juxtaposition of sound against image present in so-called \"music videos\" but relies on direct access to the experiential centers of the audience.  To this end, Rhythm and Noise suggests playback level louder than normal.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ddpvdKwuu2D9kFl0J5ckP3VPV7h.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
