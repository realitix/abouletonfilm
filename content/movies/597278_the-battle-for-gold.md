Platz hosted it somewhat along the lines of a \"lifestyles\" type of production where he would detail the lives of the various bodybuilders presented on the video and take a peek into their lives and history. A lot of the bodybuilders were asked after the fact what they thought of the show (the 1988 Mr. Olympia Contest) and the remarks were generally positive and optimistic towards the future.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
