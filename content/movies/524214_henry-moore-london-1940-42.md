From the silent deserted streets, the film moves underground into the world of Henry Moore's shelter drawings. People sit along subway platforms, looking after their children, settling down for the night, sleeping in bunks and on the floor. Above ground London burns. Henry Moore used the eye of a sculptor in portraying the stolidity and enduring patience of a besieged people. This film brings together a unique series of drawings which are some of the most remarkable achievements of an artist during wartime. Eliminating all narration, it explores, on several metaphoric levels, the very nature of human consciousness and creativity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wqndw1NZ155esKFpgqgr0HZpXjI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
