They were formed in 1967 by Gerardo Masana, during the height of a period of very intense Choral Music activity in Argentina's state universities. Their outstanding characteristic is the home-made musical instruments (hence the name luthiers, French for \"musical instrument maker\"), some of them extremely sophisticated, which they skillfully employ in their recitals to produce music and texts full of high class and refined humor. From 1977 until his death in 2007, they worked together with Roberto Fontanarrosa, a renowned Argentine cartoonist and writer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/13WE1OIFXkYjXhF5Gx6qGHDsvaA.jpg", "actors": ["Jorge Maronna (Himself - Guitar)", "Carlos N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cort\u00e9s (Himself - Piano)", "Marcos Mundstock (Himself - Emcee)", "Carlos L\u00f3pez Puccio (Himself - Violin)", "Daniel Rabinovich (Himself - Guitar)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
