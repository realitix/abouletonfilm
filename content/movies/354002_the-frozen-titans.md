But ice-climber Will Gadd knows that the technically challenging mixed route on the rear wall of the 141-metre waterfall can only be mastered at sub-zero temperatures, because that\u2019s when the loose rock is literally frozen up by the spray. However, what works for the route doesn\u2019t necessarily help the athlete. The centimetre-thick layer of ice which Will has to remove from his safety rope at regular intervals doesn\u2019t really make it easier for him to warm up to the route.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Will Gadd (Will Gadd)", "John Freeman (John Freeman)", "Sarah Hueniken (Sarah Hueniken)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Yz_XxqFwBTM"}
