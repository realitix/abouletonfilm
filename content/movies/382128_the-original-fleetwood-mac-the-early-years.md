If Rolling Stone Brian Jones had not been killed I am sure his new group would have sounded like them. The video is fun and shows just how much more tough the original group is. Any Blues rock fan needs this video or dvd.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eiw1SHp8ot7Ls7IbTjD2pDdCr9H.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
