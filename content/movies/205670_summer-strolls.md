While they are there, the young man who has the leading role begins casting cow eyes at the director's wife (Valerie Stroh), and soon she and the boy are having an affair. By the end of the summer, the wife is sufficiently charmed to wonder how she could have gotten into this situation where she deeply loves both men.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a0WSqNDHZq5s8RjVfvEOl5lZHue.jpg", "actors": ["Val\u00e9rie Stroh (Caroline)", "Michael Vartan (Thomas)", "Josep Maria Flotats (Fran\u00e7ois)", "Marie Guillard (Magali)", "Samuel Le Bihan (Xavier)", "Jean-Yves Berteloot (St\u00e9phane)", "C\u00e9cile Bois (Isabelle)", "Dupont St\u00e9phanie (Audrey)", "Pierre-Alain Chapuis (Tavoni)", "Francesc Galceran (Jordi)", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Graziani (L\u00e9on)", "Evelyne Deville (Agathe)", "Val\u00e9rie Lacombe (Viviane)", "Diane Pierens (Joanna)", "St\u00e9phane Titelein (Maxime)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
