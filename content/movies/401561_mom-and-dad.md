But shit, I've had way worse times with a movie. Probably less cathartic to someone who actually likes children or has a healthy relationship with their parents, but for me and mine? _Mom and Dad_ weren't half bad.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"}, {"pseudo": "40w2000", "content": "The movie presents a fun and interesting idea of parents trying to kill their kids and reminded me of the excellent Masters of Horror episode 'The Screwfly Solution'. \r\n\r\nWell, it was a fun idea until the movie just ended with absolutely no resolution at all. No proper ending, no answers, nothing at all. Just the credits half way through the story. I felt like I'd just wasted the last 80 or so minutes of my life. I can't recommend half a movie and I'll give it half a score. 2.5 out of 5. Don't waste your time."}, {"pseudo": "larz9", "content": "I am seriously no longer watching any more films with Nic Cage in them. Between this and his other recent release, \"Looking Glass,\" I have absolutely had it with the crappiest of storylines, some of which may have had potential but have wound up having less than a D-grade quality to them.\r\n\r\nHonestly people, don't waste your time watching this movie which is totally devoid of any entertainment value."}], "recommandations_id": [406994, 429733, 448194, 413857], "youtube_key": "O4Kb40pnoOY"}
