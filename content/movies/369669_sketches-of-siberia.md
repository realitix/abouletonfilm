His fascinating diary, Through Siberia, The Land of the Future, is an important inspiration for Sketches of Siberia, in which elements from Siberia\u2019s past, and present are visualised, focussing on the mighty Yenisey river basin. Within themes such as colonialism, exploitation of mineral resources, and demographic developments i.e. the destiny of native people and the influx of convicts and exiles, we search for the human dimension balancing precariously amid the influences from outside. Nansen\u2019s observations and considerations at the time, are mirrored in a present day context.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wcwa9CMV5KmqozgR8HEsgvnoYjZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
