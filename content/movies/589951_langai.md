Now I only have three days to pack my things. It\u2018s my sixteenth home, sixteenth room from which I\u2018ll move myself out. I am packing things and through my window I see another 215 windows. Through these windows I see immigrants, couples, misfortunes. Some read, some play, some sleep, some learn to walk on the balance beam, they come in, they go out. I am filming so I wouldn\u2018t forget about them.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
