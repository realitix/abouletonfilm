One day he is put in charge of interviewing Father Louis Stephen, a famed catholic missionary who helps the needy in the jungles of Brazil. Yet he has one problem: the Father has rarely ever given an interview. However, Michael decides that he will be the first to have interviewed the Father personally, and goes on a journey to the center of Brazil, in search of the priest. Michael will soon know how hard it can be to get an interview, and that the Father's apparent media-shyness has deeper implications than he thought.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pkVpIcoPb8nrcadhjCa4h1Ywmcy.jpg", "actors": ["Henry Czerny ()", "Patrick Bauchau ()", "Mar\u00edlia P\u00eara ()", "J\u00falia Lemmertz ()", "Daniel Dantas ()", "Ana Beatriz Nogueira ()", "Ot\u00e1vio Augusto ()", "Ot\u00e1vio M\u00fcller ()", "Lu\u00eds Melo ()", "Jackson Costa ()", "Jos\u00e9 Rubens Chach\u00e1 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
