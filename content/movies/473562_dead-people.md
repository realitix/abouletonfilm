Over hazy 16mm footage two decades later, Deutsch adopted a painfully unsentimental view of his early approach, colored as it was by notions of ethnographic film and an undercurrent of fetishism for a man he considered somehow more \"alive\" than himself. While it chafes against notions of authenticity in documentary and incisively hints at the complicity of the subject in inventing his own history, DEAD PEOPLE simultaneously oozes nostalgia, transcending its own judgment as a gauzy memorial for the man Deutsch once called a friend.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e9aXDoCS46Khql9yPUD9KJhAgl3.jpg", "actors": ["Frank J.
