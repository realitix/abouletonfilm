Prakash is called in to investigate the theft of diamonds and the kidnapping of scientists; a trail that takes him to distant Nepal (where by happy coincidence, almost everybody speaks Kannada). It leads up to a confrontation with a memorable arch-villian in an Afro and a red suit with plans to build a super-weapon capable of destroying every ship and plane in the world. Even this criminal mastermind is in awe of Prakash though, and calls him \"The most intelligent intelligence officer\" . Prakash rewards his flattery by destroying his base and overpowering him with the rather hackneyed \"Hey, look there's someone behind you\" gag. The villains for all their grandiose plans of world domination seem alarmingly dim, content with chasing Rajkumar across the hills and highways of Nepal in some bizarre real world enactment of the Roadrunner cartoons.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Dr. Rajkumar ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
