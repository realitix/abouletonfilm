Now under the rule of the evil Tanuma, the people look to Murasaki Zukin more than ever, to confront and punish those who bring misfortune upon the commoners. Will he be able to bring peace to the land? One of the greatest actors from Toei Studios, known mainly for his swashbuckling roles as powerful swordsmen such as Ryunosuke in SOULS IN THE MOONLIGHT, he appeared in 325 films both before and after the war, beginning with CHUSHINGURA in 1928, and including KUNISADA CHUJI in 1933, and DOKUGANRYO MASAMUNE. While best known for his swordplay, Chiezo really did not enjoy the action, but was able to use his menacing presence to stare down his adversaries. Although Kataoka Chiezo passed away in 1983 at the age of 79, he still has many fans today. This film shows him at his best.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y4idD7Cj2Pu8dOmt4p9HW0T0VVx.jpg", "actors": ["Chiez\u00f4 Kataoka (Murasaki Zukin)", "Kotaro Satomi ()", "Hiroko Sakuramachi ()", "Satomi Oka ()", "Shinobu Chihara ()", "Kunio Kaga ()", "Eijir\u00f4 Kataoka ()", "S\u00f4ji Kiyokawa ()", "Kusuo Abe ()", "Kensaku Hara ()", "Daimaru Nakata ()", "Racket Nakata ()", "Ichimaru ()", "Yoshio Yoshida ()", "Kodayu Ichikawa ()", "Denjir\u00f4 \u00d4k\u00f4chi ()", "S\u00f4 Yamamura ()", "Ry\u00fbnosuke Tsukigata ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
