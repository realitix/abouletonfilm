Now you can share this uplifting story with your entire family.  The Apostles begins with a miracle. Peter, having been filled with the power of the Holy Spirit, heals a man who has been crippled since birth. The crowd that witnesses the miracle is amazed. But Peter reminds them that he performed this wondrous act for one reason only-to glorify Jesus' name.  As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Peter and the other Apostles are in great danger. The religious authorities see them as a serious threat. And many of them are, indeed, persecuted. At the same time, however, some of the persecutors are themselves converted. Among them is a man who will eventually become the most important Apostle of all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6NNMM0PYSYgtPAZ3NPWJ33CMVzW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
