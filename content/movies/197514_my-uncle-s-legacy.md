Interestingly, even in the first few years after the Yugoslavian leader's death, the subject matter of this film was considered too hot to handle, and the director had to appeal to the courts for permission to shoot it. In the story, Martin is a schoolboy with a sense of the absurd and a willingness to use ridicule to amuse himself and his classmates. He has an uncle who is high up in the nation's bureaucracy who protects him and his grandfather now that his father has died. His grandfather is too stubborn to give his farm to the local farming collective, and Martin himself is in hot water with the principal for making fun of his girlfriend, one of the students at the high school. However, as long as the uncle is able to protect them, they remain out of hot water.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wvT85sTTE8cMc4swkrA05S6NJxW.jpg", "actors": ["Davor Janji\u0107 (Martin Kujund\u017ei\u0107)", "Alma Prica (Marta)", "Miodrag Krivokapi\u0107 (Stjepan Kujund\u017ei\u0107, stric)", "Branislav Le\u010di\u0107 (Vinko Maglica)", "Anica Dobra (Korina)", "Ivo Gregurevi\u0107 (Drug Radojica)", "Filip \u0160ovagovi\u0107 (Ivan Babarovi\u0107 'Baba')", "Nenad Srdeli\u0107 (Klepo)", "Ilija Zovko (Direktor \u0161kole)", "Ivan Bibalo (Barba Bepo)", "Dejan A\u0107imovi\u0107 (Markan)", "Darko Vladeti\u0107 (Mato)", "Darko Vladeti\u0107 (Mato)", "Perica Martinovi\u0107 ()", "Lidija Jenko (Tereza Ravnikar)", "Ilija Ivezi\u0107 (Predsjednik zadruge)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
