The two become a couple and even have a child together. When their study draws to an end, Christiane and Hatem have to decide if they want to share their future together. After Hatem explains to Christiane that as a woman she will not be able to work in Syria, Christiane suggests moving to the GDR together.

Thus, the two young people are forced to go separate ways.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q30dU3UfSiOFecrvXqjrsq3D8Vs.jpg", "actors": ["Bo\u017cena Stryjk\u00f3wna (Christiane)", "Rasim Balayev (Hatem)", "Lissy Tempelhof (Valeska)", "Franciszek Pieczka ()", "Galina Komarova ()", "Vladimir Puchkov ()", "Ursula Werner ()", "Dieter Montag ()", "Sonja H\u00f6rbing ()", "G\u00fcnter R\u00fcger ()", "Christoph Engel ()", "Ulrich Ansch\u00fctz ()", "Ruth Kommerell ()", "Marina Levtova ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
