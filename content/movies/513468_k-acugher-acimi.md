Pourquoi?) is the last film of the 'K' series. Each frame of film was placed individually in the printer; the film consists in fact of individual frames, developed one by one (rather than a conventional camera roll), and placed at random on the printing stock. The question posed by the film is: how can one describe the position of the Algerian administration vis-a-vis Kabylie, which has been completely abandoned by central government? It's like a game of poker, is it not ... with the only possible response one of desolation and incomprehension. An original composition by Mr. Djamel Tareb will form the musical sound-track for the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y9shnes7Ecf0qmMV5WUOmzpS7Rv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
