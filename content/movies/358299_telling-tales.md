It is also about the shop steward organising a strike at Paul's factory that jeopardises the deal with the industrialist, and about the wife of the shop steward, who happens to clean and cook for the industrialist. A network of intertwined tales told in different ways, and for very different motives, by the main protagonists.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/an4Z0bt444pY62wd32vlyczePWU.jpg", "actors": ["Bridget Ashburn (Sheila Jones)", "James Woolley (Mr Willoughby/Paul Roberts)", "Patricia Donovan (Mrs Willoughby/Ingrid Roberts)", "Stephen Trafford (Bill Jones)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
