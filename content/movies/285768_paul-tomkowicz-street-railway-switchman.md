He compares his new life in the city of Winnipeg to the life he knew in Poland, marvelling at the freedom Canadians enjoy. In winter the rail-switches on streetcar tracks in Winnipeg froze and jammed with freezing mud and snow. Keeping them clean, whatever the weather, was the job of the switchman.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q05vxvMh85vOLCDnY925wZc7OK4.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Tomkowicz (Himself)", "Tommy Tweed (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [383841, 262854, 152973, 154525], "youtube_key": "rRAQVj3Wtcs"}
