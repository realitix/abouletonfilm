In the images, always filmed by her mother, she and Sister Cecilia showed how much they grew. Five years after his grandmother's death, the rehearsal film, It's alright, grandmother is drawn as a final letter. With a difference: now it is Luiza who narrates. The film interweaves sisters' daily records and archive footage to revisit childhood memories and outline the weight that distance has put on the family.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
