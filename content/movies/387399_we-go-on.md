Paralyzed by his fear of dying, Miles Grissom offers a cash reward to the first person who can show him a ghost, an angel, a demon anything that can prove that we go on after our deaths.

We understand the main character has a big issue with death because of his traumas and such. But nothing explains why his mother is negative about everything.\r\n\r\n((SPOILER ALERT))\r\nFor me, the move becomes a nonsense when his mother for no real reason tries to kill the ghost ex-girlfriend in the cemetery, WHY!? She was not even treating anyone, yet, and then I think we ONLY have that scene with death spirits surrounding the car to make a poster... no explanations too...\r\n\r\nAfter all, it is a movie pretty okay to watch... but could be way better..."}], "recommandations_id": [408219, 355506, 110285, 381935], "youtube_key": "VURXPtrH7aA"}
