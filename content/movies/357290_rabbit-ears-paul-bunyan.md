All the larger-than-life characters in Paul's supporting cast are here, including Babe the Blue Ox, eating her ton of grain a day, and Hotbiscuit Sally with her acre-andahalf griddle. The outrageous adventures of this quintessential American hero represent the very best in the proud tradition of American storytelling.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bIN3Sg0zaNYHPwtv6sm0C4qLEEa.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
