The bird then magically takes the form of a beautiful lady named Hsiao-Hseuh, played by Cherie Chung, who falls in love with the scholar because he had saved her life. She returns the deed by rescuing him from a ruthless band of warlords. She and her sister, Hsiao-Shang, are both originally swallows, but can change into human forms due to witchcraft and wizardry. Hsiao-Hseuh later confronts Chih-Chiu, and later reveals she is a servant of an evil witch queen, who feeds on human blood. When the witch discovers their friendship and bond, she was on the verge of destroying him, but Hsiao-Hseuh pleads for his life in exchange for their separation. After being back in the custody of the witch queen, Hsiao-Hseuh sneaks out and reunites with Chih-Chiu, but posing as a different person to hide her identity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tZ5PDBL6CDqw57FX3Ym5FpMj9x2.jpg", "actors": ["Cherie Chung (Siu Suet)", "Anthony Wong Yiu-Ming (Scholar Lo Chi Chau)", "Norman Chu (Fung King Tin)", "Ivy Ling Po (Old Lady)", "Richard Ng (Right Sword)", "Eric Tsang (Left Sword)", "Lam Fai-Wong (Bandit)", "Fung Ging-Man (Pimp)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
