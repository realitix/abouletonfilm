It is the story of two businessmen - one Palestinian and one Israeli - who struggle to set up a solar energy company. Both come from societies where there is strong opposition to cooperating with the other, and the film tells how they overcome hostility from within their own families and from the people around them. In the end, they mount a Facebook campaign that brings popular support both to their joint venture and to the peace process. The film was produced by Amir Harel, an Academy Award-nominated Israeli producer, and directed by Sameh Zoabi, a leading Palestinian film-maker.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8hQFvfNj2wS9f18zPwLqvtzXm9u.jpg", "actors": ["Yossi Marshak (Shaul)", "Ali Suliman (Nizar)", "Lucy Aharish (Abir)", "Bassem Loulou (Abu Walid)", "Noa Barkai (Anat)", "Eliana Schejter (Dorit)", "Yoav Hayt (Gadi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
