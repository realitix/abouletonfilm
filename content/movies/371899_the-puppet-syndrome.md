He crafts his perfect woman out of her. But Lisa isn't a docile marionette. She's a living human being and she rebels against her creator. Based on the critically-acclaimed, brilliant and poignant novel by one of the best contemporary Russian writers, Dina Rubina, \"Petrushka Syndrome\" is a multidimensional metaphor, where a sense of duality pervades everything. People and dolls, life and art, the Creator and the creation depend on one another. And where does one draw the line between them?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/62ZVuLfXlhcbeYmZ78wB5otZJ1t.jpg", "actors": ["Evgeny Mironov (Pyotr)", "Chulpan Khamatova (Liza)", "Merab Ninidze (Boris)", "Yuliya Marchenko (Katya)", "Vladimir Seleznyov (Romka)", "Alexandr Kuznetsov (Petya in his youth)", "Alexey Lyubimov (Boris in his youth)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
