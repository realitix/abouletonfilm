There but a few choices for young people to gather and have fun, to share experiences and listen to music. Super Sound came out right from the middle of this wasteland. In this fantastic record store one could find not only the most diverse musical options, but also a group of employees who were also true fans of rock, punk, techno, or jazz music. This documentary shows how things were back then for young people and how the changes which are now part of our everyday cultural landscape began.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Rafa Garc\u00eda ()", "Giancarlo Araiza ()", "Rulo David ()", "Claudia Lizalde ()", "Mariana Arellano ()", "Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez ()", "Humberto \u00c1lvarez ()", "Mateo Lafontaine ()", "Jorge Hahn ()", "Francisco Otegui ()", "Nacho Desorden ()", "G\u00fcili Damage ()", "Alejandro Marcovich ()", "Piro Pend\u00e1s ()", "H\u00e9ctor Mijangos ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
