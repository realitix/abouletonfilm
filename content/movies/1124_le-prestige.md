This is one of the most mind-blowing mysteries that I've watched in recent years.\r\n\r\nOne of the best part, I think, is how the characters of two young magicians are depicted -- through small but noticeable details like the facial expressions, one or two words, the novels et cetera.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the title of the movie, even being explained by Cutter in the beginning, still puzzles me and I can't stopped thinking about the meaning of it. Not to mention other puzzles. But ultimately, I came to realize that the plot structure corresponds to a epic magic show as well."}], "recommandations_id": [77, 1422, 1491, 320], "youtube_key": "ijXruSzfGEc"}
