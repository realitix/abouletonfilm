This time, Hayward plays the grandson of his namesake Edmond Dantes, who, it will be recalled, was cheated out of his fortune and falsely imprisoned, only to escape and wreak vengeance on his betrayers by assuming the guise of the Count of Monte Cristo. Just like grandpa, the younger Dantes is framed by a trio of connivers and shipped off to Devil's Island. Escaping with a fellow convict, political radical Bombelles (Steven Geray), Dantes adopts the bearded guise of an elderly man in order to destroy his enemies and reclaim his birthright. One of his principal antagonists - at least during the first half of the film - is haughty aristocrat Angele Picard (Barbara Britton), who because she wasn't a part of the original conspiracy genuinely believes that Dantes is a criminal.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qhtrfhxUMI1V0LjK2PbRGp6bdDh.jpg", "actors": ["Louis Hayward (Edmond Dantes)", "Barbara Britton (Angela Picard)", "George Macready (Henri de la Roche)", "Una O'Connor (Miss Beedle)", "Henry Stephenson (Prof. Duval)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
