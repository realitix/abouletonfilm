Humiliated about having to walk home in the buff, the tykes decide to get even, declare war. Yet, as the generations battle it out, a mutual respect develops, the depth of which is evident once the man has a heart attack during one of his romps with the kids. Will the boys' older pal recuperate so that they can engage in one final battle.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vl0LnaweyqyB0sX7wzuk29tQULs.jpg", "actors": ["Jorge Russek (El Viejo)", "Ivy Goulart ()", "Leo Michelin ()", "Valdir Fernandes ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
