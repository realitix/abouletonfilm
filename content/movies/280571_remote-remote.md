In front of a police photo showing two children who were sexually abused by their parents, she tortuously cuts into her cuticles until blood drips into a bowl of milk on her lap. On top of the symbolic plane of blood and milk, the physical effect on the viewer of her destructive act of self-mutilation is extreme.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eBmBGDCKfaGpBHLI9oted7cS8Mi.jpg", "actors": ["Valie Export ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [96941, 105716, 196488, 203089], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
