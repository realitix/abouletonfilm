Shaken, she leaves and later tells her girlfriend about the incident. The girlfriend insists that she invite the fortune-teller to a party they're having at her house. What the woman doesn't realize is that the \"fortune-teller\" is actually the ex-husband she abandoned years ago, when she took their daughter and ran off with her lover.
