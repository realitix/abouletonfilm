Viggo, a machinist with two grown children, is silent about feelings, scared he'll lose his job, loud about the value of trade unionism, interested in his pet fish, and argumentative at dinner. His wife Oda puts up with his moods and works on family genealogy. When Viggo is laid off, he becomes a fish out of water, hardly looking for work, starting a garden, and taking up with Karen, a polished but unhappy widow. He lies to his wife about a union training and goes to Mallorca with Karen. When she stops the affair, Viggo ends up in a psychiatric ward and must figure out what's really important in his life and in his character", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f41d3GW4eZVKYAehrvtzugY3vW2.jpg", "actors": ["Erik Clausen (Viggo)", "Helle Ryslinge (Oda)", "Leif Sylvester (Iversen)", "Anne Marie Helger (Karen)", "Bjarne Liller (Snedker)", "Torben Zeller (Carlsen)", "Lene Br\u00f8ndum (Fru S\u00f8rensen)", "Kjeld L\u00f8fting (Falsk L\u00e6ge)", "Claus Bue (Direkt\u00f8r)", "Lars Lippert (Claus)", "Gitte Rugaard (Lone)", "Thomas Hedemann (Lars)", "Peter Rygaard (Ulric)", "Pauli Ryberg (Sindballe)", "Povl Erik Carstensen (V\u00e6rkf\u00f8rer)", "Karl Antz ()", "Lykke M\u00f8ller ()", "Birthe Malling ()", "B.
