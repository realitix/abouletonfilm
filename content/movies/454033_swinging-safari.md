What I'm not too sure about though is how much _Swinging Safari_ will ingratiate itself with people who aren't Australian, regardless of timeline. I'd be interested to hear the opinion of someone that fits that bill, because as much as I enjoyed it, I'm concerned that the appeal might not cross that barrier.\r\n\r\nAlso it really **really** seemed like Swinging Safari incorporated the Paul Jennings' story _Greensleeves_ into its B-plot, but I can't find any credit to it which is unusual...\r\n\r\nFinal rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time."}], "recommandations_id": [525460, 490004, 429202, 476764], "youtube_key": "ZB95v_pyQq8"}
