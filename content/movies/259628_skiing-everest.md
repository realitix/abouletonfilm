At the top of the world, high in the Death Zone, they lock into their skis and challenge the most dangerous slopes in the world - under weather conditions that are as perilous as the thin air, hidden crevasses, and 10,000 ft. sheer faces that drop into Nepal and Tibet far below.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yw4mU3s8qsNiaUKmiyFxkDCuNOI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
