Using real eyewitness accounts, directors B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Li\u00e9nard and Mary Jim\u00e9nez tell the story of a young woman who winds up in the clutches of forced prostitution when her initially hopeful attempt to escape the constrictions of her village goes wrong. Step by step, she is robbed of her moral and physical integrity. The film reconstitutes a space of dignity and returns voice and identity to a fate formally made nameless. With its powerful imagery, the girl\u2019s traumatic odyssey embodies the destruction of life in a capitalist world in connection with horrific natural devastation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bzJixoywpgfIi3ikbK78TFvIGKl.jpg", "actors": ["Tanit Lidia Coquiche Cenepo (Tania)", "Ismael Vasquez Colchado (Policeman)", "Yossimar Vietto Omnia (Rub\u00e9n)", "Fiorella J.
