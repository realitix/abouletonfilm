I can see why it won a film-festival award: It's briskly-paced (with some flashy editing), has a great soundtrack, and also happens to be thought-provoking (with hints of Menace 2 Society and Execution of Raymond Graham). \r\n\r\nVincent Riverside plays the Michael Madsen-esque villain here (although I don't recall seeing Madsen quite this sinister), and the lead role is competently played by Denton Blane Everett. There is a dynamic concert sequence (with Landon Dunning's character singing a tune), that almost single-handedly makes the film worth seeing.\r\nThe audio is fine, and while some of the characters' choices lack credibility, their words do not (there is no wasted dialogue here).\r\n\r\nA young Katherine stumbles upon Justin in the middle of one of his car-thefts, and winds up falling in love with him. Justin was previously incarcerated for a murder (that of his own father), and Katherine has a hard time believing he actually committed the crime. She thinks there is a redeeming lining to all of Justin's dark clouds, and she may be right. \r\n\r\nThe climax (and it's preceding revelation) must be seen to be believed. Upon my first view, I am an instant fan of Mad-Bad."}], "recommandations_id": []}
