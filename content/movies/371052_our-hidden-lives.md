In his book, Garfield selected some of the most expressive diarists, and focused on the post-war years giving a vivid portrait of how Britain coped in the post-war years and how little, or how much, attitudes have changed over the past 60 years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l003pwkY5TBCe0evrP6x0wUwwdW.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Briers (Herbert Brush)", "Sarah Parish (Maggie Joy Blunt)", "Lesley Sharp (Edie Rutherford)", "Ian McDiarmid (B.
