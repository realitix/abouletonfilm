The former Husker Du co-songwriter/singer/drummer welcomes you into his world, immediately addresses any HD reunion possibilities in an old interview, and is shown wailing behind his kit during that renowned middle-American punk band's heyday.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s7jIHDzq1KzufTYxP53QsOeocgP.jpg", "actors": ["Grant Hart (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "sABk91JeI54"}
