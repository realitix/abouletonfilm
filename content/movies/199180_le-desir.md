In the first skit, a young child's impressions are observed as his newborn baby sister becomes a part of the family. In the second, a young woman falls in love for the first time one summer, and in the third, a tough, older peasant woman battles against the farming cooperatives. Finally, in the last segment, everything comes full circle as a woman who is about to become a grandmother dies while her daughter-in-law has not yet given birth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9zHOsqQCfkjnlen05RGwQ7Cx1SW.jpg", "actors": ["Jan Jakes (Joska (segment \"O chlapci, kter\u00fd hledal konec sveta\"))", "V\u00e1clav Babka (Father (segment \"O chlapci, kter\u00fd hledal konec sveta\"))", "Jana Brejchov\u00e1 (Lenka (segment \"Lid\u00e9 na zemi a hvezdy na nebi\"))", "Ji\u0159\u00ed Vala (Jan (segment \"Lid\u00e9 na zemi a hvezdy na nebi\"))", "Franti\u0161ek Vnou\u010dek (Father (segment \"Lid\u00e9 na zemi a hvezdy na nebi\"))", "Otto \u0160im\u00e1nek (Brother-in-law (segment \"Lid\u00e9 na zemi a hvezdy na nebi\"))", "V\u011bra Tich\u00e1nkov\u00e1 (Andela (segment \"Andela\"))", "V\u00e1clav Lohnisk\u00fd (Michal (segment \"Andela\"))", "Zdenek Kutil (Pavelka (segment \"Andela\"))", "Frantisek Mus\u00e1lek (Father (segment \"Andela\"))", "Vladim\u00edr Men\u0161\u00edk (Combine Driver (segment \"Andela\"))", "Vlastimil Brodsk\u00fd (Shoemaker Novosad (segment \"Andela\"))", "Anna Mel\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (Mother (segment \"Maminka\"))", "Ilja Racek (Frantisek (segment \"Maminka\"))", "Jir\u00ed Pick (V\u00e1clav (segment \"Maminka\"))", "Marie Kyselkov\u00e1 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
