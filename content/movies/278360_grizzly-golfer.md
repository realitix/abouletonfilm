When Magoo and Waldo go to play golf, they wind up in the middle of a bear hunt. Magoo mistakes a grizzly bear for Waldo and proceeds to make the bear caddy for him. The bear continually gets clobbered by clubs, balls, you name it. Meanwhile, Waldo is nowhere to be found, and the hunters are closing in. Just as Magoo is playing the last hole, the hunters open fire (seeing the bear), and everyone runs away: Magoo, the bear and Waldo.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hAoOmaBjnskpQ3CmKdYGEEXZtRV.jpg", "actors": ["Jim Backus (Mr. Magoo)", "Jerry Hausner (Waldo)", "Daws Butler (Bear)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
