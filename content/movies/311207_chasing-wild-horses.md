His work graces the covers of everything from Vogue to Victoria's Secret. Since his childhood in Montreal he has carried with him a singular artistic vision. Wild, long-maned dark horses running though white sand dunes. It took him nearly a lifetime to learn where his vision came from. When he discovered Sable Island he became obsessed with the natural beauty of the untouched and unclaimed wild horses.
