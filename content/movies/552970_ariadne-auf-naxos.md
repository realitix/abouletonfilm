Deborah Voigt stars as Ariadne, the mythical heroine abandoned on the island of Naxos by her lover, and Richard Margison is Bacchus, the young god who eventually takes her away to a new life. The spectacular Natalie Dessay as Zerbinetta leads the troupe of comedians who unsuccessfully try to cheer Ariadne up. Susanne Mentzer is delightful as the young Composer of the opera-within-the-opera, and Wolfgang Brendel sings the Music Master.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xlsCsRTnJ0u4oGaNYbExfKahfL7.jpg", "actors": ["Deborah Voigt ()", "Natalie Dessay ()", "Richard Margison ()", "Nathan Gunn ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
