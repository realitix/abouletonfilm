Originally broadcast as a television special, Neil Diamond - The Thank You Australia Concert: Live 1976 captures that historical night, preserving a consummate performer at his most muscular.  Striding the stage in yellow shirt and leather pants, Diamond is a master showman, playing to the rafters while somehow making the massive venue into an intimate club show. The singer spends almost as much time chatting with the crowd as he does playing music, including an extended run through of all the places from around the country and around the world the concertgoers have traveled from.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o0aQGk2ngMMrFk1r7PdQrfyWZhw.jpg", "actors": ["Neil Diamond (Himself)", "Richard Rodney Bennett (Lead guitar)", "King Errisson (Percussion)", "Tom Hensley (Acoustic & electric piano)", "Alan E.
