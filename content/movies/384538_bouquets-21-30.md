The filming basically entails using the film strip as a canvas with the freedom to film frames on any part of the strip in any order, running the film through the camera as many times as needed. Thus each bouquet of flowers is also a unique bouquet of film frames.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c6uuMIVMWLna4Qan6QR622skU1c.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
