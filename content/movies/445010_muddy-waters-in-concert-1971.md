In his mid-30s, Waters picked up his first electric guitar and began to revolutionize popular music. With the mix of his southern roots and gritty urban life, Waters pioneered a new form of the Blues. This program features footage from a 1971 West Coast tour, and features the songs \"Long Distance Call,\" \"Mannish Boy,\" \"Got My Mojo Working,\" and many more.  Rolling his eyes toward heaven and shaking his head like a man possessed, Muddy Waters cast a powerful spell. His high cheekbones and Oriental eyes gave him a certain Eastern, inscrutable quality, and at times his face even became angelic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jdzpHghIyef7eJWfIc1t65KTo9I.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
