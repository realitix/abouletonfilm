I watched _From a House on Willow Street_ with a group, and all of us became confused at one point or another throughout the film's runtime, not because it's overly complex, but because it's so dull that it was hard to remain totally focussed. Even Sharni Vinson, who I am a massive fan of, was no good in this.\r\n\r\nThat all said and done, they get away with some pretty rad creature design for a movie with this low a budget.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}], "recommandations_id": [403368, 355506, 409297, 387399]}
