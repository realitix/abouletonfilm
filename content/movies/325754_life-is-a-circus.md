Their efforts to save a struggling circus provide the laughs in this uproarious comedy, also starring Goldfinger icon Shirley Eaton and featuring Flanagan and Allen's rendition of their greatest hit, Underneath the Arches.  The Crazy Gang have been jacks-of-all-trades with Joe Winter's Monster Circus for almost as long as Joe has been on the road, and they're still hoping for a big break. But Joe has hit hard times: his equipment is mortgaged, most of his acts have deserted him and even the elephants have walked out. So the Gang set about finding a way to save the circus... and come up with a typically novel solution!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/13gBr0JZB97MW2vXjQIP0BGLSRs.jpg", "actors": ["Bud Flanagan (Bud)", "Teddy Knox (Sebastian)", "Jimmy Nervo (Cecil)", "Jimmy Gold (Goldie)", "Charlie Naughton (Charlie)", "Eddie Gray (Eddie)", "Chesney Allen (Ches)", "Shirley Eaton (Shirley Winter)", "Michael Holliday (Carl Rickenbeck)", "Lionel Jeffries (Genie)", "Joseph Tomelty (Joe Winter)", "Eric Pohlmann (Rickenbeck)", "Harold Kasket (Hassan)", "Edwin Richfield (Driver)", "Peter Glaze (Hand #1)", "Marie Devereux (Houri Girl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
