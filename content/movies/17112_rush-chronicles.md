With this collection of 'hit' videos from Rush we can see why. Almost befittingly, Rush's best videos appear to be those that simply demonstrate their playing. Studio footage of Rush is rare and welcomed on this DVD.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v3cAqEjQP4GDYqZiMPoYKv5keDG.jpg", "actors": ["Alex Lifeson (Guitars)", "Geddy Lee (Bass, Synthesizers)", "Neil Peart (Drums, Percussion)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
