He's circling the drain of life, his job and his family relationships are hanging by a thread.  But he is still passionate about the written word and the English language even if he is having trouble connecting with most of his students\r\n\r\nEnter Juliette Binoche as a well known and successful painter with a frosty temperament, who is suffering from severe rheumatoid arthritis and has taken a teaching position at the small school.  An instant antagonistic, flirtatious friendship is formed, as the two teachers inspire their students into a battle over which is more important, words or pictures, and in doing so inspire themselves.\r\n\r\nA fairly average film that is elevated by the engaging performances of the two leads, who have great chemistry together.  It's probably not going to change your life, but it is entertaining as a more intelligent romantic comedy/drama."}], "recommandations_id": [319910, 333319, 60270, 253283], "youtube_key": "0bxIKcYUNCg"}
