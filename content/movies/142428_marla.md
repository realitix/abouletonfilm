It\u2019s intimate, intense and surprising; romantic but dark. Marla and Sam meet in the restroom of a bar. They talk and \ufb02 irt, but this isn\u2019t just a story of boy meets girl. Marla is a woman living with a strange medical condition \u2014 something she brazenly describes to Sam during their \ufb01rst conversation. This is a kind of challenge \u2014 she dares Sam to be shocked, repelled or intrigued. Sam is all of these things. What happens between Sam and Marla affects them both profoundly \u2014 more than love", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1qkcZ411LKCgPtPmsXpNy3lUF0u.jpg", "actors": ["Eddie Ritchard (Marla)", "Dale March (Sam)", "Lani John Tupu (Carlos)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
