Are you going to lie back and let the clowns take over? Are you going to stick your head under the duvet as Bozzer de Pfeffel Johnson rides his crazy zipwire into town? Mind you that duvet is warm and cosy, isnt it? And theres a cup of tea available. And a muffin. And a chocolate cupcake.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rsBwhsLHKABOxvRkRmIRPmhsPkq.jpg", "actors": ["Andy Parsons (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
