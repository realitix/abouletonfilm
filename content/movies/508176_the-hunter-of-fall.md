Nothing stirs far and wide.  Suddenly, a figure comes out of the forest, running quickly to the farm.  There's a quick grab and the hunting rifle is hidden in the gutter.  There's a jump to the window sill:  Obermeier Martl creeps like a cat into his room.  No one's seen him.  At the same time, the doorbell rings at Doctor Rauch's place.  The hunter's mate Hias is standing outside.  \"Doctor, you have to bandage me:  I've been shot!\"  By whom, he doesn't know.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fijivR1PdnBg5bXNlfOs7XaDM0o.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Richter (Friedl)", "Georgia Holl (Burgl)", "Hans Adalbert Schlettow (Blasi)", "Thea Aichbichler (Buchnerin)", "Gustl Gstettenbaur (Toni Donhart)", "Rolf Pinegger (Lenz)", "Willy R\u00f6sner (Birkhofbauer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
