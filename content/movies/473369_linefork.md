Lee is a retired coal miner and revered banjo legend, a living link to the deep past of American music. Though now well into his eighties and hampered by age, Lee continues to perform and teach his distinctive 2-finger banjo style to a new generation eager to preserve a vanishing cultural tradition. Linefork offers an immersive view of Lee and Opal's daily rituals and inherent resilience while documenting the raw yet delicate music of a singular musician, linked to the past yet immediately present.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1elC3HWamYEu4YDUSbQvCS94a4m.jpg", "actors": ["Lee Sexton (Himself)", "Opal Sexton (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
