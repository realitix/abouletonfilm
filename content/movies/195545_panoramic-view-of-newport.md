This picture was taken under these conditions and shows the beautiful scenery comprising the harbor of Newport, R. I. In the foreground, the spray of the vessel and the foam on the water gives a fair idea of the rapidity at which this boat is moving.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
