Covering the late March through April general elections of 1994 in which right-wing conservatives routed the incumbent leftists. This is particularly upsetting for Tunin, a mechanic with a firm belief in communism. Fearing that his party is about to lose, he journeys to a northern village to stir up trouble. He isn't there long before he is arguing with a beautiful hairdresser. Their debate is fiery as is his growing and impossible-to-disguise passion for her. She too is intrigued with him, but their disparate ideologies threaten to keep them apart.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6PPFJbwELYsmijCxN9Gfa2sbt7Q.jpg", "actors": ["Tullio Solenghi (Tunin Gavazzi)", "Veronica Pivetti (Rossella Giacometti)", "Piera Degli Esposti (Palmina)", "Cinzia Leone (Anitina)", "Gene Gnocchi (Zvanin)", "Cyrielle Clair ()", "Mirella Falco ()", "Rossy de Palma ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [73688, 132071, 56793, 62460], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
