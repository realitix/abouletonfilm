Closely following the compositions of Ray's original film, director Ann Oren presents printed frames from online videos in a stack directly below the camera\u2014adding a single frame to the stack every few seconds. The unhurried process of stacking the images by hand slows the otherwise speedy consumption of pornographic media in a nod to Ray's preoccupation with the female body as sculpture.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
