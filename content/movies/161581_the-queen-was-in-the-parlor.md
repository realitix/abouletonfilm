He goes to his throne and summons his jester, Goopy Geer. A black knight arrives and threatens one of the young ladies in court; Goopy fights him off, first with an ax, then in armor from kitchen utensils, then butting him with a mounted animal head, which makes the knight's armor fall apart. He pulls it together again and runs away.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6h1TF08cGvsKiH6I8kEXos5VObn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
