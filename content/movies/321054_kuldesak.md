In fact that is what it is about, the quality of meaninglessness of living in a place that turns people into zombies. In a place where meaning must be invented, these kids turn into the only place, the only culture they see worth tuning into: television and movies. Thus they slowly degenerate into the abysmal reinterpretation in a sort of sickening anti-hero, anti-social statements that goes absurdly a wrong turn.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1RfmdrOnQlbe49Q4vbnB6aFVwFR.jpg", "actors": ["Bianca Adinegoro (Lina)", "Oppie Andaresta (Dina)", "Ryan Hidayat (Andre)", "Wong Aksan (Aksan)", "Tio Pakusadewo (Aladin)", "Iwa K (Hariolus)", "Torro Margens (Jacob Gamarhada)", "Rebecca Tumewu (Dini)", "Bucek (Ceki)", "Sophia Latjuba (Sofi)", "Dik Doank (Max Mollo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "C5MzBn3Jp_I"}
