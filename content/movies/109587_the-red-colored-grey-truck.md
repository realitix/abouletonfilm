Yugoslavia is falling apart. Gavran can't get a driving licence because he is color blind. He is a rural Bosnian introvert obsessed with trucks. So, as soon as he is released from prison, he steals a truck to go on a joyride. Suzana, a city girl, discovers she is pregnant, but until she's due for an abortion, she decides to go to Dubrovnik. She hitchikes and Gavran almost runs her over. She is unhurt, but she blackmails him to take her to Dubrovnik. Two people from different worlds, equally removed from the real one. For him she is the first woman he can talk to; for her he is just another idiot to add to the long list of them that she has so far compiled. But the pressure of danger and the intimations of war force them together. The world about them has become so absurd that they seem to each other the only sober people left.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2cER56Sw7UCRzjqgxNPY6YWjYfn.jpg", "actors": ["Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107 (Ratko)", "Aleksandra Balmazovi\u0107 (Suzana)", "Dragan Bjelogrli\u0107 (Svabo)", "Bogdan Dikli\u0107 (Pop)", "Boris Milivojevi\u0107 (Grbavi)", "Milorad Mandi\u0107 ()", "Branko \u0110uri\u0107 ()", "Milutin 'Mima' Karad\u017ei\u0107 (Sredoje)", "Toma Kuruzovi\u0107 ()", "Michael Weitz ()", "\u017deljko Bo\u017ei\u0107 ()", "\u0110or\u0111e Brankovi\u0107 ()", "Zoran Brklja\u010d ()", "Milan Del\u010di\u0107 ()", "Bojan Dimitrijevi\u0107 ()", "Uro\u0161 \u0110uri\u0107 ()", "Vladan Dujovi\u0107 ()", "Vladan Gajovi\u0107 ()", "Andre Heneke ()", "Dubravko Jovanovi\u0107 ()", "Darko Kokoru\u0161 ()", "Branislav Lalevi\u0107 ()", "Sa\u0161a Latinovi\u0107 ()", "Nata\u0161a Markovi\u0107 ()", "Radoslav Milenkovi\u0107 ()", "Goran Petranovi\u0107 ()", "Anja Popovi\u0107 ()", "\u0110or\u0111e \u0160arga\u0161 ()", "Marko Vasovi\u0107 ()", "Branislav Zeremski ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [54649, 33611, 109678, 108835], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
