His girlfriend adores him, his best mate David is loyal to the end, plus David\u2019s girlfriend doesn\u2019t mind a quick hook-up either.  But Michael\u2019s self-regarding lifestyle comes crashing down when he is diagnosed with a terminal illness. Desperate not to let his life just fade away, Michael steals the $200,000 raised for his treatment, and catches a one-way flight to London.  He isn\u2019t there for long before his nerve and sense of humour earn him a vicious beating in a back alley. Waking up cold and bloodied, he finds himself being watched over by the ethereal Sylvie; a mysterious French drifter. They fall head over heels in love, and attempt to outrun death itself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/58thMWwICm1jfgsiH3SRekTCHUP.jpg", "actors": ["Matt Whelan (Michael)", "Roxane Mesquida (Sylvie)", "Pana Hema Taylor (David)", "Sophie Henderson (Tina)", "Caren Pistorius (Chloe)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "jjvf-wxHl50"}
