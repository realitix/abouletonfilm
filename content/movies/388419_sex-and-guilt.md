Life is grand on the surface, but it becomes exponentially harder to maintain Angela's plush lifestyle, especially on the salary of a local cable installer. A few illegal transactions with Angela's short tempered Uncle Frankie, and Big George, an obese drug dealer with a penchant for illicit chemistry, and Ray manages to stumble upon the American Dream - South Florida style. Ray's fantasies, religious rearing, a horny groupie, and unrequited love for a thought provoking bi-sexual named Sara are causing him to question his life and morality. In the end Ray will have to deal with insurmountable fear, passion, and nagging guilt as he questions; is this life really worth living?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Drew Stacey (Ray Didio)", "Ben Affan (Manny)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
