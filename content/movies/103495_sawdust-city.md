Unable to pick up the scent on his own, he calls his older brother Bob who has remained in town building a business and a family.  The estranged siblings hit a series of old bars, but while Pete is intent on finding their father, Bob just wants to drink and reconnect with his little brother.  Along the way, they\u2019re joined by Gene, a barroom hustler. He promises to lead the brothers to their father (as long as they buy the beer). Desperate, they accept Gene\u2019s half-cocked guidance through the small town dives. As the quest falters, the drinking increases; old grievances arise, and the brothers must face the past and each other.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["David Nordstrom (Bob)", "Carl McLaughlin (Pete)", "Lee Lynch (Gene)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "aWhvt99dVYA"}
