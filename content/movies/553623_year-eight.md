When Sofia befriends a young woman on the beach, it becomes clear that their intentions are much more malicious and complex than friendship. As more girls are dragged into their prostitution ring, Ben becomes entranced with Amanda, a woman with the mental capacity of an eight-year-old that reminds him of his missing daughter, Mia. While Sofia has other plans for her, Ben acts as a protector until Amanda's parents show up to forcefully take her back and break up the couple's lucrative business.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pd0fwKyOW0dg1I8otcpUfXWxfWc.jpg", "actors": ["Joseph Camilleri (Ben)", "Jeanne Young (Sofia)", "Grace Ingland (Amanda)", "Alexander Hero (Dom)", "Viv Farmer (Sue)", "Caroline Samija (Kelly)", "Samantha Laurenti (Susan)", "James Allen Brewer (Lonny)", "Alphonso Thompson (Deebu)", "Boynton Paek (Ralph)", "Sara Herold (Monica)", "Sandy Koerner (Mia)", "Karolyn Cable (Rebecca)", "Manuel Fernandez (Mario)", "Kathy Grachek (Carol)", "Fernando Pereira (Richard)", "Matrice Balinton (Jayla)", "Fatimah Eye'z Verrell (Neeva)", "Judy Cerda (Misty)", "Blaine Santos (Peter)", "Derek Crowe (Dillon)", "Maralynn Adams (Tudy)", "David Koerner (Patron)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
