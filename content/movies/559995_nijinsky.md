During his approximately ten years as a dancer, Vaslav Nijinsky (1889-1950) set a new standard both technically and expressively, while in his choreographic work he pointed the way towards modern dance. All three aspects - the dancer, the choreographer and the person Nijinsky - form the starting point for John Neumeiers latest creation. Neumeier, who as early as 1979 presented a short ballet Vaslav, is regarded as one of the leading Nijinsky experts worldwide.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a9GCxmXgvwKi51FbkV4IDEvFiAw.jpg", "actors": ["Alexandre Riabko ()", "Carolina Ag\u00fcero ()", "Patricia Friza ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
