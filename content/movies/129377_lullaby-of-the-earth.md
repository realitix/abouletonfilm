Notwithstanding her healthy distrust of all strangers, which her upbringing instilled in her, it is not long before a cunning racketeer finds her weak point, that temptation which she cannot resist, that weakness, different as it may be, that each of us has, and brings her into his power. What follows is a depiction of her cruel descent into the depths of moral decay, as she becomes a collaborator in a system of exploitation, unbridled lust, vanity, and greed, in which she and other victims are always the losers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uDhykCOfBRusTYLe3HTQfVrYZ1f.jpg", "actors": ["Mieko Harada ()", "Meiko Kaji ()", "Natsuko Kahara ()", "Eiji Okada ()", "Mihoko Nakagawa ()", "Y\u00fbsuke Sat\u00f4 ()", "Kinuyo Tanaka ()", "K\u00f4ji Uruki ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
