From the comfort of your seat, you'll thrill to the larger-than-life vista of raging waters as you take a heart-pounding ride over the Falls and experience other death-defying stunts performed there.  Meet the daredevils who challenged the fury of the Falls: The Great Blondin, who completed a death-defying tightrope walk over the river in 1860; and Annie Taylor, a 63 year-old teacher who was the first person to go over in a barrel and live to tell the story.  Created by Academy Award winner Kieth Merrill, the film takes you back to before the first Europeans discovered the Falls and gives you a glimpse of their 12,000 year history. No trip to the Falls is complete until you've seen Niagara: Miracles, Myths and Magic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6Xoug0zvJFROSQDAiAmP3Wk2dlf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
