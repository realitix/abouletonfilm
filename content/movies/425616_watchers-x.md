Bureaucratic red tape, the TSA, and other roadblocks have prevented it. But now, after decades of being hidden in a box in Oregon, a huge Peruvian skull is found \u2014 one that has been in the U.S. for so long it became available for DNA testing. Along with this, the red hairs from the baby mummy (WATCHERS 8) and three other skulls were tested. The origins of the elongated-skull people are finally known scientifically.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6Hy95Daie4ccvdI8nPBMBMiTr7U.jpg", "actors": ["L.A.
