In one gory match, Terry Funk, whose specialty is taking more punishment than any sane person could stand, meets the evil and vicious Sabu in a ring surrounded with barbed wire. In their battle for the ECW World Heavyweight championship, it doesn't take long for them to be smeared with blood, beating the hell out of each other while hopelessly entangled in strands of wire. It eventually takes several men with tools to cut them free as the announcer proclaims that the action just witnessed is too brutal to ever be shown on television. In another match Steve Austin, before he became \"Stone Cold\" and attained primetime stardom, battles in a \"three-way dance\" with other notorious bad asses Mikey Whipwreck and the Sandman. And Mick Foley, in his \"Cactus Jack\" persona, tangles with Terry Funk and gets burned (literally).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7mPBAU2m7FnIxUov0siE3mSrOUp.jpg", "actors": ["Steve Austin ()", "John Watson (Mikey Whipwreck)", "Terry Funk (Terry Funk)", "Sabu ()", "Scott Charles Bigelow (Bam Bam Bigelow)", "Peter Senercia (Taz)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
