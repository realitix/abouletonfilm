Throw on you sneakers and get ready to play chase as Manny and hist team of talkative tools use creative thinking and special treats to round up the pets of Sheetrock Hills. Crunchy carrots do the trick when bunnies escape from the pet store, bananas might be gopher's favorite treats, and it turns out birds just love pretzels!
