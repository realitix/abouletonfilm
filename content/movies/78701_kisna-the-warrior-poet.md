At this time, a young Indian, Kisna befriends and then shields a British girl Katherine, from an enraged mob of nationalists including Kisna's own uncle and brother. Katherine is the young daughter of a ruthless British collector. Kisna takes it upon himself to escort Katherine to the safety of the British High Commission in New Delhi, who will arrange for her to board a ship home. A tender attraction develops between Kisna and Katherine during the journey, a love story that is torn between 'Karma' (the noble deed) and 'Dharma' (the duty). Laxmi, the Indian girl Kisna is engaged to, forms the third point in an emotional triangle involving the Indo-British romantic pair", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iQsP7imeFQd28rAkdO3NkOOO35y.jpg", "actors": ["Vivek Oberoi (Kisna)", "Isha Sharvani (Lakshmi)", "Antonia Bernath (Katherine)", "Amrish Puri (Bhairo Singh)", "Polly Adams (Lady Katherine)", "Michael Maloney (Peter Beckett)", "Caroline Langrishe (Jennifer Beckett)", "Om Puri (Juman Masum Kishti)", "Rajat Kapoor (Prince Raghuraj)", "Yashpal Sharma (Shankar Singh)", "Hrishitaa Bhatt (Rukmani)", "Vivek Mushran (Nandu)", "Vikram Gokhale (Dada Guru)", "Zarina Wahab (Shanta)", "Jeetu Verma (Phunkara)", "Sushmita Sen (Naima Begum (Item Number))", "Ronit Roy (Special Appearance)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
