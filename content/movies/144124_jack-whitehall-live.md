Fantastically funny and had me rolling on the floor. I've always enjoyed his performances in A league of their own and Mock the week where he bounces off the other guests so I was a little dubious about him performing alone, however he was excellent and I would recommend him to anyone."}], "recommandations_id": [21941, 307257, 50061, 50006]}
