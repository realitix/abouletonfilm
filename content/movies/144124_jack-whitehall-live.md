From dates at Nando's to lads' holidays in Magaluf, British customer service etiquette to having sex at his parents' house. Jack dances from one story to another, effortlessly extracting the humour from every situation.  With sell-out national tours, nominations at the British Comedy Awards and the Edinburgh Comedy Awards for his stand-up, much-lauded appearances on The Royal Variety Performance and Live At The Apollo, and his recent acclaimed roles in Fresh Meat and the self-penned Bad Education, Jack Whitehall is one of the UK's brightest comedy stars.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gFixzilX6ChWmLlXDTF99AiNpLw.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Whitehall (Himself)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "JohnnyParanoia", "content": "Jack Whitehall's debut DVD is brilliant. Fantastically funny and had me rolling on the floor. I've always enjoyed his performances in A league of their own and Mock the week where he bounces off the other guests so I was a little dubious about him performing alone, however he was excellent and I would recommend him to anyone."}], "recommandations_id": [21941], "youtube_key": "iNE8f_70xwo"}
