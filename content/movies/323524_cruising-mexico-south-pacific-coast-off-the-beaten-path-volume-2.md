This video presents almost two hours' worth of little known secrets about where to go, what to see, and what to do on a cruise of Mexico's stunning southern mainland Pacific coast (where few cruisers ever go). Presented as one cruiser sharing tips with another, you will discover where the most romantic, picturesque and charming anchorages are (and which ones to avoid). You'll find out the best spots for snorkeling and swimming, and learn about exciting inland adventures and explorations that will enhance your cruise and make it truly special. The southern mainland Pacific coast of Mexico (south of Manzanillo) is much less visited than the northern coast, and the few cruisers who get there are usually moving fast on their way to or from Central America. However, in many ways it is the most cruiser-friendly and enjoyable part of Mexico's entire coast, including the Sea of Cortez. This is an area to linger.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
