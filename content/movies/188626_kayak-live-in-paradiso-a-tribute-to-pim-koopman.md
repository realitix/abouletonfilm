The concert was held on November 22 at the Paradiso. It involved not only Kayak, but also some artists with whom Koopman had worked in the past. Some of the names that appeared on stage: Pussycat, Caren Maywood, Alides Hidding, Jos\u00e9 Hoebee and Michael Robinson. Okkie Huysdens (with whom Koopman formed The President) and Jeroen Engelbert (one of many members of Koopman's band Diesel) also performed. For the occasion, Kayak used Hans Voerman as an extra keyboard player. The drumstool was occupied by Hans Eijkenaar. After the concert, Kayak announced that Eijkenaar was the new drummer of Kayak. With Eijkenaar on drums, Kayak released their latest album Anywhere But Here in September 2011.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aP49mnPH9tkSn6NBqdBQkFvHmz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
