It's about a newcomer struggling with being the outcast on his first night. And a legend coming to terms with life after her last night in drag. And it's about a bunch of other back-stabbing queens with their own problems who just plain can't stand each other. Even the stories of some of the patrons play a part in the chaos. Cherry Pop is a real-time roller coaster ride where you better be strapped up, tucked in, and ready to go!\r When Zaza, headliner of a weekly drag show, 'CHERRY POP', refuses to come out of her dressing room, all hell breaks loose backstage. A young newcomer, The Cherry, is hiding a huge secret from the girls while getting ready for his debut performance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/egonvS0GnvrswGTJhGBRqXaI6ZL.jpg", "actors": ["Lars Berge (The Cherry)", "Matthew Sanderson (White Chocolate)", "Patrick Holt (Lady Zaza)", "Bob the Drag Queen (Kitten Withawhip)", "Misty Violet (Ariela)", "Latrice Royale (Terry)", "Toccara Jones (Terry's Wife)", "Henry Zaga (Brendan)", "Carmit Bachar (Ariela's Mother)", "Dina Shihabi (Cherry's Wife)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [504331, 407897, 464207, 423710], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
