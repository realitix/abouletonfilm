My ambition was to try and capture some of the town\u2019s psyche and a little bit of its\u2019 geography. To this end I was aided by the photographer Sebastian Edge, his ancient wet collodion photographic techniques, a mobile dark room and his assistant Gloria Lin. I documented the making of a series of photographs that managed to capture a sense of \u2018place\u2019. Ever alert to the spirit of \u2018timesgone\u2019 I have edited sounds and images that evoke a somewhat off-kilter reading of all things Rochellaises.\" \u2013 Andrew K\u00f6tting", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
