He works a dead-end office job where his colleagues make fun of him but comes alive when he's out dancing, drinking and womanising.  Edward's world is turned upside down when he meets Agatha - the woman of his dreams - who helps him to become the gentleman he's always strived to be, but is she real or just a paper doll?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
