Not just me, many others said the same. Those we were never read the original source. Yes, it was based on the book of the same name. I really liked it. Unpredictable, but once it reveals its secret, it feels so simple that we'd missed. Straightforward storytelling. No flashbacks. Great characters, but that's where the story had a strong grip. Especially when the suspense unveiled, you might say all the earlier events were in the wrong direction, which were intentionally done to divert viewer's envision.\r\n\r\nAn alcoholic woman who daily takes the train to work, witnesses out of the window a woman happily married and living the life of her dream. When one day she sees a mysterious man with her, the tale takes a twist. Following the suspense, what she finds and how the film ends are the remaining part. Emily Blunt was very good. There are other characters, but it was Emily's story, told from her perspective. Recognisable role with an award, but the film's theme was an adult. Not like sexual exploration, but the basic outline was drawn out of such concept. One of the finest crime-mystery in the recent time, so surely worth a watch.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"}], "recommandations_id": [340666, 302946, 303858, 332567], "youtube_key": "-CKPj4O5_9s"}
