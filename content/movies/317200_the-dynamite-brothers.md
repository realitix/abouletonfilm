Released in the U.S. as The Dynamite Brothers, the film concerns the misadventures of three brothers, musicians all. The story follows the siblings' progress from the conservatory to a desert island to the Venice Carnival. The message is that happiness must be earned, a sugar-coated pill of wisdom that went down easily with the film's youthful fans. Not quite in the Disney league, I Fratelli Dinamite is nonetheless colorful, expertly rendered entertainment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vi6qt18LjxJ3gFdC10Dw9JwOwkU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
