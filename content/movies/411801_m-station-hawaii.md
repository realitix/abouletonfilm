The government sees this as an opportunity to learn what they can from the submarine. However, they don't want to let the Russians know that they found it or had time to analyze their equipment, so they recruit a salvage company to get the sub and what salvageable material there may be. However, the Russians must try and do everything they can to make sure that none of their materials or equipment could be analyzed by the Americans.
