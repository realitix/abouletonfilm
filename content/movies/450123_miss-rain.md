Her brother spends his time on a boat fetching her between the lakeside village and the meanders of the river. Whether she is swimming or moving on the water to fish, she is reassured, in harmony with her element. When the rainy season is approaching and it is time to leave the floating dwellings for terra firma, Miss Rain remains alone in her cabin among the reeds. The land sends her back to her nightmares. For her, the forest is the place where the devil hides. Over 30 years ago, under the Pol Pot regime, all of her family was killed in the woods and her spirit has never recovered from it. Her dreams are still filled with shadows and flames.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4ZZKojdNXMp4iKOVf217jMSJX5C.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
