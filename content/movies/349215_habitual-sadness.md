Known as \"comfort woman,\" they were abducted as teenagers and shipped off to the front to service as many as 30 troopers a day. In 1991, some of them began testifying about their experiences. Byun Young-Joo worked with such women for two years on her previous film The Murmuring, a documentary which broke nearly a half century of silence on the subject and was screened at the Amnesty International Film Festival in 1996. A \"sharing house\" was then established for former comfort women and provided the setting for Habitual Sadness, a documentary showing the enduring wounds but strong spirit of these women. Habitual Sadness as the second film in the \"murmuring\" trilogy was a major success in South Korea and a hit at the Hong Kong Film Festival.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
