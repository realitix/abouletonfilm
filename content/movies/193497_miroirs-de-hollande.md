During filming he held the camera upside down and afterwards put the images \u2018up right\u2019 again in the film. By doing this, we see the \u2018usual\u2019 waterfront, but transformed by the rippling of the water. In this way Mirror of Holland became a modern looking experimental film. However this did not devalue the Dutch sentiment regarding waterfronts that are so trusted to so many.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jLO5cucwUVRwhzLOALAqUpkrcFN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [129971, 117595, 183728, 289994], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
