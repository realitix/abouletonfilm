After a very successful run in London\u2019s West End in 1968, viewings of this controversial movie have been few and far between.  Stunning black and white camera work by Ian Wilson brings to life this \u201cchilling fable\u201d by Max Steuer, a lecturer (now Reader Emeritus) at the London School of Economics. Avoiding easy answers, The Committee uses a surreal murder to explore the tension and conflict between bureaucracy on one side, and individual freedom on the other. Many films, such as Total Recall, Fahrenheit 451 and Camus\u2019 The Stranger, see the state as ignorant and repressive, and pass over the inevitable weaknesses lying deep in individuals. Drawing on the ideas of R.D. Laing, a psychologically hip state faces an all too human protagonist.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/WTejUSVi1G1NP22G6UYzDc1T75.jpg", "actors": ["Arthur Brown (Himself)", "Jimmy Gardner (Boss)", "Paul Jones (Central figure)", "Tom Kempinski (Victim)", "Robert Langdon Lloyd (Committee Director)", "Pauline Munro (Girl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
