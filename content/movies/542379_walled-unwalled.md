Centered on a series of court cases that used auditory or sensory evidence based on information gathered through walls, the film is staged within two soundproof booths, in which a live narrator recites witness testimonies while projected text and images create organic superimpositions. It\u2019s an exploration of the fundamental abstractions of seeing and listening.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8N09ssvk2Sz0Rd7aRHw2xtaD4DD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
