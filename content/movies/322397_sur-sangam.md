Through his riyaz of a life time, he has come to the very core of the musical God - Param shiva. He's the embodiment of music. The notes &amp; rhythm talks to him. (naad chhipa tan mein, laya man mein). Due to the ignorance of the masses - Classical music is becoming mis-interpreted &amp; being ignored. He had his share of great respect &amp; great concerts, but it's slowly dying, and not for himself but to keep the tradition live - he's ready to teach the art to a select few, but no one comes his way. When Tulsi (Jayaprada) who knows his greatness, but drifted away in life due to circumstances, sends her son to learn from shastriji.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sMWrHEOfmkqPbuMzhmNlcIMLjio.jpg", "actors": ["Girish Karnad ()", "Jayaprada ()", "Deven Verma ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
