The students at the college are taking part in drunken revelries which annoys the college Dean.\r\n\r\nThe new secretary takes an interest in college affairs and smooths things over when the Dean expels a student for the drunken partying. She also finds her uncle who really is a poet pretending to be a caretaker and also runs a bar on the side.\r\n\r\nCharles Hawtrey plays the Dean's pompous son who gets involved with the students partying. Ronnie Corbett has a small early role.\r\n\r\nNot much plot to the film and it is all rather shaky and unsatisfying."}], "recommandations_id": []}
