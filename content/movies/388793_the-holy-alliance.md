They were even more disgruntled when they realized how the coup was being manipulated by leftist officers to instigate genuine elections and establish a constitution for the first time in Portuguese history. Though their intent was to form a radical socialist state, circumstances prevented this, and a genuine parliamentary democracy emerged. This film explores the circumstances of a right-wing businessman during those times. The man is an old-fashioned authoritarian, whose attentiveness to the needs of his mistress, wife and son is crude where it exists at all.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Io Apolloni (Sandra)", "Lia Gama (Maria)", "Henrique Viana (Jos\u00e9 Saraiva)", "Helena Isabel (Sandra's model)", "Adelaide Jo\u00e3o (Nurse)", "Lu\u00eds Mascarenhas ()", "Orlando Costa ()", "Teresa Roby ()", "Victor de Sousa ()", "Camacho Costa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
