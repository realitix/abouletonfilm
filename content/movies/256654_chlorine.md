Once vivacious couple, Roger (Vincent D'Onofrio) and Georgie  (Kyra Sedgwick), have settled into a complacent lifestyle of mediocrity where their marriage is falling apart and their children are turning away from them. Nonetheless, the desperately discontent Georgie pushes Roger into finding a way to invest in the market bubble in the hopes that their family can be saved with the money they are sure to make. When local tennis pro and part-time drug dealer, Pat (Rhys Coiro), comes to Roger for investment advice, Roger sees his opportunity.  Torn by the reality that his family could be saved by this dirty money, Roger finds himself staring down the barrel of a moral conundrum.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j6r6aG2EmnxBXgvykzWNl6dsOWq.jpg", "actors": ["Vincent D'Onofrio (Roger Lent)", "Kyra Sedgwick (Georgie Lent)", "Flora Cross (Cynthia)", "Ryan Donowho (Henry)", "Tom Sizemore (Ernie)", "Elisabeth R\u00f6hm (Katherine)", "Rhys Coiro (Pat)", "Michele Hicks (Elise)", "Dreama Walker (Suzi)", "Matt Ball (Josh)", "Jordan Belfi (Doug)", "Brian Petsos (Anderson)", "Erin O'Brien (Ted's Secretary)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "C2aOndslZT4"}
