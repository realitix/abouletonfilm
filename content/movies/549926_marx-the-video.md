Marx\u2019s erupting, diseased body is juxtaposed with the \u201cbody politic\", and posited as a symbol of contemporary society proceeding the failed revolutions of the late 1960s. Seeking a parallel between the body of the state and women\u2019s bodies, Kipnis brings to light the manner in which women\u2019s bodies have been used as the site of displacement for social and political anxiety, with the state of the nation currently reflected in a female body plagued by anorexia and bulimia, traversed by pornography, manners, and regulations on abortion.
