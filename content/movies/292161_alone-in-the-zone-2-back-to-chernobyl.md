Thanks to the views from the helmet-cam, you can feel like you were really there. You\u2019ll be able to say \u201eI was there\u201d and no one can accuse you otherwise. In the film you\u2019ll see places no one has seen before (well, almost no one). You\u2019ll also see places no one will see again because they don\u2019t exist any more. Everything to make you feel the real atmosphere of these places.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h3BZDuxAzS1cjkMek2tN5uKC4E9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
