The motorist and mechanic are seen (except for the opening and closing shot of the motorist driving) as shadows on the wall of the garage. Goofy and Pluto appear in brief cameos to show us an unconventional model of automobile.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jzdY3L6aG1kN9NCoUkxKA3tLywP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
