He tells his mother (who went blind from crying over her son's death) that he will no longer fight. However, being a movie with the words \"fist\" and \"fury\" in the title, Chen doesn't keep his promise for very long.  Japanese occupiers who are aware of Chen's history terrorize his family by, among other things, vandalizing his mother's store and beating up his brother. Later, they frame Chen for a murder. After the Japanese boss arrives in town and causes a ruckus, Chen breaks out of jail for a final confrontation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mcqoPpZfodZrRmKAU0HjTP6gZ4B.jpg", "actors": ["Ho Tsung-Tao (Chen Shen)", "Michelle Yim (Mai Suet)", "Ku Feng (Japanese boss)", "Bruce Tong Yim-Chaan (Martial arts student)", "Fong Yau (Japanese lead)", "Hon Gwok-Choi ()", "Lau Hok-Nin (Martial arts teacher)", "Mai Kei (Japanese thug)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
