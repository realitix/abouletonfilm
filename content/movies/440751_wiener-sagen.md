The rectilinear architecture finds its opposition in colorful mosaics and paintings on their walls, depicting a more vibrant future.  Using Super8 &amp; 16mm projections, the artists create a performative mosaic of this utopian reality.  Performed by Stefanie Zingl, Stefanie Weberhofer and Stefan Voglsinger", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
