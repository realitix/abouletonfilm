Pam, Tommy and Tammy are all played by Trecartin, who, wearing his signature make-up, jumps back and forth between male and female roles. Totally self-absorbed and equipped with vestigial attention spans, the characters are constantly communicating with one another on the phone or online.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Lizzie Fitch ()", "Ryan Trecartin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
