Using the code name of Plumbum, Ruslan Chutko (Anton Androsov) delights in the pursuits of lawbreakers before informing the police, and he even turns in his own father when he catches him poaching fish. The questions are left to the viewer whether or not Plumbum is a crusading hero or a scoundrel. Western audiences may find the premise implausible, but children were known to inform on their own parents under the regime of Josef Stalin and others.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jkapaItsAdd87UKjMgdYiAgjrUE.jpg", "actors": ["Anton Androsov (Ruslan 'Plyumbum' Chutko)", "Yelena Dmitriyeva (Sonya)", "Elena Yakovleva (Maria)", "Aleksandr Feklistov ('Grey-Hair', the Militia commander)", "Vladimir Steklov (Lopatov)", "Aleksandr Pashutin (Ruslan's father)", "Zoya Lirova (Ruslan's mother)", "Aleksei Zharkov ()", "Aleksey Guskov ()", "Vyacheslav Baranov ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [48012], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
