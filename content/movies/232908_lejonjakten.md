The film is a cruel parody on Danish producer Ole Olsen's \"L\u00f8vejagten\" (1907) which was at the time banned in Denmark (due to the fact that a lion and other animals were actually killed in the film) but shown in Sweden. In the student version two actors dressed up as a lion and a kangaroo get shot by hunters, but the hunters themselves soon get arrested by the police, an allusion to a recent conflict between the students and the local police.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Gustaf Lundskog (Animal)", "Per Olsson (Hunter)", "Torsten Rietz (Animal)", "E.G.
