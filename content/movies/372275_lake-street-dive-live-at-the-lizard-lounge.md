So you\u2019d be both in the right and the wrong to pick this one up. But we should focus on the positives first. The soundtrack largely culls material from Lake Street Dive, with three choice, intriguing covers thrown into the mix: the old soul and R&amp;B standard \u201cThis Magic Moment\u201d (first recorded by the Drifters in 1960, but then covered by unlikely acts such as Lou Reed and the Misfits), George Michael\u2019s \u201cFaith\u201d and Hall and Oates\u2019 \u201cRich Girl\u201d. While the band\u2019s recorded output leans into folk, soul and jazz territory, Live at the Lizard Lounge is a much more rocking affair, largely focusing on the guitar and trumpet finesse of Mike Olson.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aRxVXuO6yxd7TRBygdr2Mi4793T.jpg", "actors": ["Rachael Price (Herself)", "Mike Olson (Himself)", "Bridget Kearney (Herself)", "Mike Calabrese (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "3zsVk8eoPq4"}
