The men explain that San Francisco is now occupied entirely by the wealthy class. But stoplights still burn out and trains occasionally jump their rails. Blue-collar labor isn't obsolete, but it's scarce. The city has created a program to \"remigrate\" long-gone working class families from their inland homes back to the city that once pushed them out. Kaya, Helen, and Naomi return to San Francisco and join a handful of other potential remigrants for a tour of what can be expected in their new lives. But can they learn to trust their old home once again?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xbFJBaWmt4hfhmN2S9P8rCZ2rTV.jpg", "actors": ["Russell Hornsby (Kaya)", "Paola Mendoza (Helen)", "Rick Yune (Jonathan)", "Avelina Salazar (Naomi)", "Jesse Dubus (Brian)", "Graham Leggat (Doctor)", "Rena Marie Guidry (Maya)", "Tom Ramirez (Gilbert)", "Valerie Gail Perry (Valerie)", "Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez (Francisco)", "Kevin Prado (Paul)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "NDqa9r7oUJA"}
