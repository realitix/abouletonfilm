Journeying to six US cities, the film opens the viewer's eyes to what's happening down the street \"in plain sight\". Through engaging interviews with numerous victims of sex trafficking, the force, coercion, and deception of the children and women becomes apparent. In the midst of the darkness, stories of hope and freedom emerge as each survivor shares how she was impacted through the work of a sex trafficking aftercare home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xqQfW281Hz49OWfzeuLGeqe1L9h.jpg", "actors": ["Natalie Grant (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
