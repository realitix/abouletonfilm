These are all original recordings, with nothing ironed out or added at the studio. Everything was recorded in top quality, filmed with 6 HD cameras plus camera crane in 5.1 surround sound. When it came to the mix, Funker Vogt put a lot of emphasis on the live atmosphere, so for the first time, the familiar Funker Vogt hits are presented on DVDs the way we\u0092ve known and loved them for years. But that\u0092s not nearly all: the second DVD includes \u0093Wrestling, Shotguns, Trailer Parks\u0094, a 105-minute film, and performances at the M\u0092era Luna festivals 2002, 2004 and 2006.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5cPsoZFI0ZYUQaV0Kmw68FFNGNn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
