A victim of wrong decisions he loses everything, family and wealth. He goes from a life of comfort with a promising future guaranteed by his wealthy grandfather, Sayyed al-Rawi, to the life of a pauper. Alone and destitute, he remains unbroken in his quest to fight the Waqf to recuperate his inheritance. He faces his tribulations with surprising stoicism and hope, sustained by a strong conviction that he is 'a man with a mission' and a political program to bring social justice to his people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vsOW9NTL3wSUKm63eASd255oxWP.jpg", "actors": ["Nour El-Sherif ()", "Mahmoud El Gendy ()", "Mohsena Tawfik ()", "Farid Shawqi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
