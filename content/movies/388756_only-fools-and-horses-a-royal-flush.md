Having obtained a pair of tickets to the sold-out production of Carmen, Rodders seems to have deeply impressed Vicky. She is less taken by the presence of Del and his peroxide blonde dolly bird. Especially when they open the crisps. Vicky then invites Rodney to a party at the Duke's country home, and it seems romance may be on the cards. Then Del Boy turns up, hits the vino-plonko and ruins everything for his little brother.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ooKesvDHWEe0zppgx2eIcj8stxf.jpg", "actors": ["David Jason (Derek 'Del Boy' Trotter)", "Nicholas Lyndhurst (Rodney Trotter)", "Buster Merryfield (Uncle Albert)", "Roger Lloyd Pack (Trigger)", "Sarah Duncan (Lady Victoria)", "Jack Hedley (Henry, Duke of Malebury)", "Roy Heather (Sid)", "Diane Langton (June Snell)", "Kate Williams (Mrs Miles)", "Peter Tuddenham (Charles)", "Arnold Peters (Patterson)", "Ifor Gwynne-Davies (Carter)", "Richenda Carey (Lady at Opera)", "Robin Herford (Man at Opera)", "Gordon Salkilld (St John's Ambulance Man)", "Roger Davidson (Mr Dow)", "Geoffrey Wilkinson (Eric the Chauffeur)", "Stephen Riddle (Giles)", "Alan Cody (Ticket Collector)", "Christina Micheals (Programme Seller)", "Robert Vahey (Dosser)", "Andrew Readman (Policeman)", "Paul McDowell (Man in Market)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
