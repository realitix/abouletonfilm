The little protagonist is being deceitfully seduced by a shady \u201cmaster\u201d and cynical collector of keys. In consequence of the mystery and rather incomprehensible events, the world of his unconcerned childhood falls apart. The boy gets lost on his way back home while his concerned mother takes up a desperate attempt of finding her little son. \u201cToto\u201d, a kaleidoscope of events filled to the brim with suspense and awe, is a universal story about naivet\u00e9 and irreversibly lost infant dreams. If we lack the word to name the phenomenon, we don\u2019t know precisely what exactly happened.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rNYb5ZrOx9DCOEwpwY24Kjo61PY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "OeizeU2LzzU"}
