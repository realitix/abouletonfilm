Il l'ach\u00e8te car cet objet lui rappelle des souvenirs. Il se rend sur la base a\u00e9rienne abandonn\u00e9e (fictive) d'Archbury o\u00f9 il a servi pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Le film fait alors un flashback en 1942. Le colonel Keith Davenport \u00e9tait le commandant du 918e Groupe de bombardement \u00e9quip\u00e9 de Boeing B-17. Envoy\u00e9 au combat peu de temps apr\u00e8s son arriv\u00e9e, le 918e a subi de lourdes pertes, gagnant la r\u00e9putation d'\u00eatre un groupe \u00ab porte-poisse \u00bb et, le moral est au plus bas. La cause principale de ces pertes est la strat\u00e9gie am\u00e9ricaine de bombardement de pr\u00e9cision de jour pour d\u00e9truire des cibles sp\u00e9cifiques, plut\u00f4t que de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des bombardements en \u00ab tapis de bombes \u00bb.

The men are shattered emotionally and it is deemed their previous commander (Gary Merrill) has been soft with them, no chance of that with Savage, but is he himself taking too much on?\r\n\r\nSplit into two parts, the first half of pic deals with how a group of men in war time can reach their lowest ebb. Fear of the jinx, fear of cracking under the strain, these men are by definition demoralised. Things are further compounded by the appointment of Savage, who drags the group further down the battered emotional scale. Second half softens things for a short while as Savage's methods begin take a hold, then there's the missions and it builds to the film's revelation, which ironically lets Peck become a revelation as well.\r\n\r\nDirector Henry King is on form, showcasing the skill of directing an ensemble cast, which sees Dean Jagger add mighty heft to the work of Peck, Merrill, Hugh Marlowe, Paul Stewart and Millard Mitchell. The flying sequences are expertly photographed (Leon Shamroy), with real footage splicing effective, while the writing allows the piece to exude a realism factor, which in turn offers up a more humane war film delving into psychological stings. 8/10"}], "recommandations_id": [51802, 16442, 79758, 14328], "youtube_key": "AGEekUoEQUM"}
