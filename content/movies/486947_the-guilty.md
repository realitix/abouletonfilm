It's basically a room, a man and a telephone, and still manages to tell an intense story (and with a twist). Grim, but still has a few fun moments of relief. Fantastic performance by Jakob Cedergren, who also turned out to be a really nice guy (saw it Zurich Film Festival, and there was a Q&A with him). If you have a chance, go see it!"}], "recommandations_id": [491584, 440161, 517839, 440298]}
