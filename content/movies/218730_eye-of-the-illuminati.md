While time moves on, and the years pass by, we allow ourselves to become more subjected to psychological and developmental damage brought on by a system of control, rules, response-abilities and consequences. How long has this damage been happening, and how has it effected the natural course of human evolution and progress as a species? Is there truly a master plan in effect to restrict our potential and keep us from evolving into what we are truly meant to be as a people? It is important that the world is connected in oneness, but is this simply an idea or part of the plan to bring in a one world government system?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ntBaPkSv6woxFEdZwXSwXAMlmq7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
