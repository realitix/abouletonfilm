Having gained their trust, he was able to get close to them. Living among the gang members, he witnessed horrific events, and while hiding his real identity, he photographed a one-of-a-kind collection of gripping stills.  Over thirty years have passed. Esaias Baitel has laid his camera down. He returns to the dark nights he spent in the City of Lights, the city where he lived a double life, going back and forth from the gang to the young family he had just started.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zPHDsyEHTUA59wKqm1CWEfCxchQ.jpg", "actors": ["Esaias Baitel (Himself)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "DDA1996A", "content": "Terrifying, the film is a must watch!\r\nIt is more scary because how real it is."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ms1ppzaib4g"}
