The wedding shindig will bring its share of unexpected surprises.  This is a film is part of the DOGME 95 Movement, described as follows: 'the goal of the Dogme collective is to purify film-making by refusing expensive and spectacular special effects, post-production modifications and other gimmicks. The emphasis on purity forces the filmmakers to focus on the actual story and on the actors' performances. Given these restrictions the story and the action of DIAS DE BODA ('WEDDING DAYS') seem much more immediate and the lapses in fluidity of the story can be forgiven - to a point.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i3seUnvwjuDeCfsh2HS2hUILW9j.jpg", "actors": ["Monti Casti\u00f1eiras (Rosendo)", "Comba Campoy (Sonia)", "Ernesto Chao (Alejandro)", "Bel\u00e9n Constenla (Josefina)", "Rosa \u00c1lvarez (Rosa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
