From the time pioneers settled the Salt Lake valley, Mormon culture has drawn the public eye and colored the public record - for better or for worse. This landmark volume explores nineteenth-, twentieth-, and twenty-first-century Mormon society through the perspectives of journalists, novelists, travel writers, presidents, and other well-known public figures, including such varied personages as Susan B. Anthony, Buffalo Bill Cody, Mark Twain, Charles Dickens, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, President John F. Kennedy, and more. Some of the accounts are humorous, some flattering, some exaggerated, some insightful. This engaging companion to the Much Ado About Mormons book entertainingly illustrates outsider views of a still-peculiar people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dFurb2f3a6QxzVm4fBW4rMDt1T2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
