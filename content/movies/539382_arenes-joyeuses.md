But that is not counting on Escopette, an opponent of bullfighting, who kidnaps the bulls. What further complicates things is that the appointed bullfighter, Chico de Granada, takes the French leave with Violette, one of Cabissol's daughters. As a measure of retaliation, Cabissol decides to force Escopette to replace Chico in the arena. Fortunately, R\u00e9my, the head herdsman, comes to his rescue. Finally, everything goes well and Cabissol is so happy that he gives R\u00e9my the hand of Marguerite, his other daughter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s2AbOeXI6q2oI8zhSwceJVkq2j2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
