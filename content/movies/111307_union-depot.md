Hungry and desperate for a break, Chick fortuitously comes across across a valise abandoned by a drunken traveler. In it he finds a shaving kit and a suit of clothes with a bankroll, which help transform the affable tramp into a dashing gent. After buying himself a meal, Chick seeks some female companionship among the many hustlers who walk the station. He propositions Ruth Collins, a stranded, out-of-work showgirl and takes her to the station's hotel.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r9ujw92xMRPQ7dFH6rzKzbenuhs.jpg", "actors": ["Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (Charles 'Chick' Miller)", "Joan Blondell (Ruth Collins)", "Guy Kibbee (Scrap Iron Scratch)", "Alan Hale (The Baron, aka Bushy Sloan)", "David Landau (Kendall)", "George Rosener (Dr. Bernardi)", "Earle Foxe (Jim Parker)", "Frank McHugh (The Drunk)", "Adrienne Dore (sadie)", "Irving Bacon (Depot Hotel Waiter (uncredited))", "George Chandler (Panhandler Wanting One Dollar (uncredited))", "Mary Doran (Daisy (uncredited))", "Ethel Griffies (Cross Woman at Magazine Stand (uncredited))", "Lucille La Verne (Lady with Pipe (uncredited))", "Charles Lane (Luggage Checkroom Clerk (uncredited))", "Dickie Moore (Little Boy (uncredited))", "Jason Robards Sr. (Station Agent (uncredited))", "Ray Turner (Men's Room Attendant (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
