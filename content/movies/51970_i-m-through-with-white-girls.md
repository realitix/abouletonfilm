After a slew of bad break-ups, Jay gives up white women, \"cold turkey,\" and he goes on a mission: \"Operation Brown Sugar\". But because Jay doesn't fit the \"brotha\" stereotype, he fails miserably with the \"sistahs.\" Then he meets the dynamic Catherine, a misunderstood \"Half-rican Canadian\", who's as righteously quirky as he is. To win her heart, Jay must confront his fears as he realizes commitment is a bigger issue than race.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iYrsTtzLY3ACI7qUAUZ9cTN4Kbv.jpg", "actors": ["Anthony Montgomery (Jay Brooks)", "Ryan Alosio (Matt McKenzie)", "Lia Johnson (Catherine Williamson)", "Lamman Rucker (Drake Moore)", "Kellee Stewart (J.C.
