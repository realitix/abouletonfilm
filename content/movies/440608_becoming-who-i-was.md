Indeed, in a past life he was a venerated Buddhist master. His village already treats him like a saint as a result. The village doctor, who has taken the boy under his wing, prepares him to be able to pass on his wisdom. Alas, Tibet, Angdu\u2019s former homeland and the centre of his faith, lies far away from his current home in the highlands of Northern India. On top of that, the conflict between China and Tibet makes the prospect of a trip there even more daunting. Undeterred by these harsh facts, the duo set off for their destination on foot, accompanied by questions of friendship and the nature of life. With its narrative approach steeped in a serene sense of concentration, this documentary film, composed over a period of eight years, stands as a fundamental experience in its own right.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nD2Kxw02sWbiQPfk3V6D2Y0H4wm.jpg", "actors": ["Angdu Padma (Himself)", "Rigzin Urgain (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
