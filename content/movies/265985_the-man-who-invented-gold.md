Ridiculed by his neighbours, a madman works in isolation on a chemical formula for making gold. He finally succeeds after being told the secret in a dream, but his conceit drives him to get back at his sceptical friends, turning one neighbour into gold before he is punished by being turned to gold himself.' -Mark Webber", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dGsMLd3RIRYWvHX0GAb2pFBzAKB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
