In the momentary opening shot the camera spies on riverside joggers from the Donaumarina U-Bahn station. Inside a nearby care home, two elderly women are eating. One is the artist\u00b4s mother. She stares into the camera, from where a loving hand reaches out to caress her face. Finally, we see a Christmas pudding decorated and surrounded by candles, all afire. The scene is reminiscent of the flaming Christmas tree in Anger\u00b4s Fireworks but was in fact inspired by a viewing of Po zakonu (By the Law) by Kuleshov. The flames burn strongly and race out of control, causing the camera to become agitated, breaking free from its static point of observation, perhaps in panic.\r The film is characteristic of Friedl vom Gr\u00f6ller\u00b4s project to break down the separation between daily life and the making of art, being a particularly compelling example of her recent works that meditate on the process of ageing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4KDX77505SVobNwFQbVN3NXELVI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
