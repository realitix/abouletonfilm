The basis is a written film treatment of the musician John Zorn, in which 254 scenes, bundled into 15 sequences, are captured in short, sometimes cryptic descriptions. Hills, very much in the style of a Harry Smith or Bruce Conner, has collected takes of radically differing origin for each of the 254 script directions and funneled them into a complexly ramified stream of associations. The sequence of scenes is underscored, or rather, interlocked, with pieces from the John Zorn composition The Bribe (1986), a musical tribute to crime fiction writer Mickey Spillane.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tvOOduDzqEURyCLrbSUwPHArCiZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
