Despite Scott knowing that this was a homophobic hate crime, the assault was not treated as such in the courts, or by the media. As Scott rebuilds his life, he is forced to make sense of the way the incident was handled while also struggling to make peace with his attacker. Taking place across the three years following this life-changing ordeal, close friend and filmmaker Laura Marie Wayne gracefully charts the impact of the attack on Scott\u2019s life, both physically and mentally. The resulting documentary is a tender, heartbreaking and inspiring testament to one man\u2019s strength and resilience.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/egCl6L7hrFhTpBf9dVc9G7Amh70.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
