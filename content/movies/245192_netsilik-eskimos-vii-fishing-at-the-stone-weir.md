The men are in the river, lifting stones and placing them to form enclosures to trap the fish. A woman skins a duck and then braids her hair in the old way, stiffly around sticks. From a bladder she makes a balloon for the child. The men are fishing with the three-pronged leisters, spearing the fish and stringing them on a thong, until it is as much as a man can do to drag his catch from the water. The woman works quickly, cleaning the fish, and then all enjoy bits of the fresh raw fish.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jdKXxCneo4SEYHejYFjIWNT6AAl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
