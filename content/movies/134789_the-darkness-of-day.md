It is comprised entirely of found 16mm footage that had been discarded. The sadness, the isolation, and the desire to escape are recorded on film in various contexts. Voice-over readings from the journal kept by a brother of the filmmaker\u2019s friend who committed suicide in 1990 intermix with a range of compelling stories, from the poignant double suicide of an elderly American couple to a Japanese teenager who jumped into a volcano, spawning over a thousand imitations. While this is a serious exploration of a cultural taboo, its lyrical qualities invite the viewer to approach the subject with understanding and compassion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/63wV6Jg6BcATSeKQFYmBxuwHNor.jpg", "actors": ["Beverly Berning (Voice)", "Richard J.
