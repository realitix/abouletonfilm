Henri (Hubert Lucot) belongs to a terrorist gang that orders him to kill the sister of one of their members. The member himself died when he single-handedly carried out an attack on a carload of American military advisors in Paris. Henri balks at this assignment, since the gang only wants the sister assassinated because they believe that she would name them to the authorities. Instead of following through, Henri runs away, and the others soon follow in hot pursuit.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xDyiRXorDVXXwrgATIZbSfHGqfm.jpg", "actors": ["Hubert Lucos ()", "Christine Laurent ()", "Catherine Bonnin ()", "Philippe Garrel ()", "Eric Mitchell ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
