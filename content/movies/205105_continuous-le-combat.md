Using voice-over narration, Falardeau presents a compelling analysis of the structure of wrestling and its rituals. The good guy against the evil antagonist, the forces of order and the desires of the crowd. \u00b1  The audience becomes part of the spectacle in this powerful show where wrestlers confront one another under the watchful eye of the referee. It is a ritual of catharsis. The documentary begins with the words, images and sounds of Quebec's political struggle, \"SOS F.L.Q. Continuons le combat\". Produced right after the October Crisis in 1970, a crucial moment in Quebec's struggle to become a sovereign state, independent of Canada, the tape is charged with the bitter experience and political aspirations of the period. We recognize in this tape, the \"Falardeau style\" evident through a very strong narration that supports the images till the end, when the video abruptly closes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nnM1dPiqmDo2lXgXtc1at8h0Tp3.jpg", "actors": ["Lawrence Robert Shreve ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
