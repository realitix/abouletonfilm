While most of the attributes from 1995's Riverdance: The Show remain--the dazzling ensemble choreography, Bill Whelan's energetic score, and the New Age-y view of Celtic mythology--the most significant difference is at the top, where Colin Dunne replaced bombastic lead dancer Michael Flatley. Though lacking Flatley's bravura, Dunne is a superb technician who works well with Flatley's former co-lead, Jean Butler. Flamenco dancer Maria Pagis returns, as do the Riverdance Singers (formerly known as Anuna) with soloist Katie McMahon and the orchestra with fiery fiddler Eileen Ivers. About a half-hour longer than the 1995 original, Live from New York City expands upon the second act's theme of the Irish leaving their homeland", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ayEJDF3l2H7Fi6IXLHfEQiwm7S3.jpg", "actors": ["Jean Butler ()", "Colin Dunne ()", "Mar\u00eda Pag\u00e9s ()", "Katie McMahon ()", "Morgan Crowley ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
