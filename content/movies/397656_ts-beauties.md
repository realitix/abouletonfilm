In the next scene we find Gina Hart and David Chase wondering if Gina's secret will create a problem in their relationship if David's young son finds out. Following this we find high powered and cocky businessman Nick Capra drawing his personal assistant Nina Lawless into his fantasy of sexual tension and generously offering his transgirl assistant what he thinks every woman dreams of, a night with him. Finally find Riley Quinn and Brock Avery, now free to explore and express their love after Brock's wife leaves him when she finds out about his affair with the beautiful young trans brunette.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c4J4d2OPZ96rijJS4547KsHujdk.jpg", "actors": ["Aubrey Kate (Rachel)", "Connor Maguire ()", "Nina Lawless (Nina)", "Nick Capra (Mr. Thomas)", "Gina Hart ()", "David Chase ()", "Riley Quinn (Lauren)", "Brock Avery ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
