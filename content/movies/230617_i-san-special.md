When the bus stops, the drama in the characters' real lives can be seen. In different cirumstances, it's not hard to imagine the characters - a young small-town girl (glamorous model), an older woman (hi-so boutique owner), an illegal Burmese immigrant (hotel waitress), half-Thai backpacker (handsome hotel owner), soldier (ladyboy hostess) and dodgy businessman (dodgy businessman) - assuming the lives of their larger-than-life soap opera alter egos.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fw8zoTzqOPFpgGHaULg7wRWyazy.jpg", "actors": ["Mesini Keawratri ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
