While perhaps not as entertaining to a person unfamiliar with Finnish traditions, the brilliant acting, directing, plus the warm, beautiful Finnish summer more than make up for the cultural gap.The story begins with a group of brothers with their families coming up to honour the memory of their recently deceased father. Spending time together, opening old wounds and creating new ones... it all boils down to brotherhood. No matter what happens, brothers take care of their own.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jl98IeLn2nSLPUADx9VEY8xAbul.jpg", "actors": ["Taneli M\u00e4kel\u00e4 (Erkki Hakala)", "Esko Salminen (Veikko Hakala)", "Esko Nikkari (Paavo Hakala)", "Vesa M\u00e4kel\u00e4 (Seppo Hakala)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
