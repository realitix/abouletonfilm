They were one of the very first international artists to tour the huge country of Russia - and their fans are still very thankful until this day. So recording a LIVE DVD to highlight the \u201cSteelhammer\u201d tour was an opportunity the band didn\u2019t want to miss. It is the first LIVE release of U.D.O.\u2019s new line-up which easily convinced fans and critics alike on recent festivals and headlining gigs. The band comes up with an exceptional setlist, incl. many classics that haven\u2019t been played for a long time, fan favorites and tracks from the recent success album \u201cSteelhammer\u201d.
