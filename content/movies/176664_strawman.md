With a deaf old mother, a mental disordered sister whose husband was killed in war, and a bunch of children, it was not hard to imagine that they were really poor. One day, a heavy unexploded bomb fell down from the sky on two brothers' farmland. The brothers brought the bomb to the Japanese police as a \"gift for the Emperor of Japan\". Unfortunately, the Japanese were frightened by the bomb and order them to throw it into the sea. They could do nothing but obeyed the order. The bomb exploded when thrown into the sea. A great number of dead fishes came out of the sea. The two brothers collected the fishes back home. When they saw their exciting family enjoy the fishes, they felt that God is fair.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1TS4ZCLFzmNUFaAIuLU9gygpm8Q.jpg", "actors": ["Yang Kuei-Mei ()", "Ko Chun-Hsiung ()", "Lin Mei-Chao ()", "Wen Ying ()", "Fanny Chang Chun-Fang ()", "Po-Chou Chang ()", "Cho Sheng-Li ()", "Ping Nan Wu ()", "Ying Ying ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
