She smokes while one strums a lute, one looks at a magazine, and two fiddle with string. The door opens and in comes a young man, cigarette between his lips, a swagger on his face. The young woman laughs. As the four young men continue disconnected activities, the other two become a couple. When the four realize something has changed, first they stare at the couple who have kissed and now are dancing slowly. The four run from the house in a kind of frenzy and return to stare. The power of sex has unnerved them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k5SAkAdvDIQzUlJUs1C2KokdhyY.jpg", "actors": ["A.
