Some crooks arrive seeking medical attention after their boss has been wounded in a shoot out with the cops. Mistaken for doctors, the boys are forced to operate on the wounded crook, but instead they accidentally dump him out the window into a passing police car. The rest of the gang chases them into a store room filled with dummies where the cops finally catch the bad guys.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eAP6j3vlLuiJf4B0dPymkB2cDv7.jpg", "actors": ["Curly Howard (Curly)", "Moe Howard (Moe)", "Larry Fine (Larry)", "Dudley Dickerson (Watchman (uncredited))", "Al Hill (Watchman (uncredited))", "Al Hill (Crook (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
