This cross country adventure is all about taking the new Mopar and connecting with the old school Mopar; as the wild travelers meet up with some legends of the Mopar world like the Mopar Nationals, Jim Beliends, Five Star Productions founder, John Pappas, and world famous driver of the Little Red Wagon wheelstander, Bill Maverick Golden.
