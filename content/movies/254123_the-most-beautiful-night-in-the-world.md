But Kaname isn't as boring as it seems on the surface. Not with characters around like Shimeko, a girl genius with a childlike lack of propriety, and her ace fisherman/folk-singer dad. Or the overbearing and unpleasant local Shinto priest, a former Christian cultist. Or Endo, Kazuya's new colleague, a bitter drunk after his son's suicide. Or Kin, a former terrorist, now a hermit on his boat engaging in secret \"research.\" Or perhaps most importantly Teruko, the hypnotically beautiful bar owner, the focus of all manner of innuendo and intrigue. Something mysterious, even mystical, is going on Kaname, and hapless Kazuya is about to be thrown into the middle of it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uQidoKt4qlm7XB7y3MwokfIzKH4.jpg", "actors": ["Tomoro Taguchi (Kazuya Mizuno)", "Sarara Tsukifune (Teruko Hinohara)", "Haruki Ichikawa (Midori)", "Shunsuke Matsuoka (Ishizuka)", "Michi\u00e9 (Shineko)", "Ayumu Sait\u00f4 (Kenji Onizuka)", "Noriko Eguchi (Teresa)", "Noriko Eguchi (Endo)", "Akira Emoto (Journalist)", "Akira Emoto (Beggar's Wife)", "Kan Mikami (Gonza)", "Ryo Ishibashi (Kinichi Nihei)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "FIaI9ioLUow"}
