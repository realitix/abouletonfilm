Through candid interviews with doctors and scientists representing both sides of the issue and HIV positives on and off the drugs, the film opens minds and much-needed dialogue. Informative without being instructive, it raises fundamental questions about what we think we know. Its surprising and sometimes shocking revelations inspire us to take a closer look at HIV and AIDS and the systems that support our current views.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/luAIxxP6A6URFwIssd4sOtrZt3U.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Gallo (Himself - Doctor, Discoverer of HIV)", "Frank Sontag (Himself - Impact Show, KLOS Radio)", "Michael Eller (Himself - PhD, President of Health Education AIDS Liaison)", "David Rasnick (Himself- PhD, AIDS Researcher)", "Rodney Richards (Himself - PhD, HIV Test Founding Scientist)", "Charles Farthing (Himself - Medical Director, AIDS Healthcare Foundation)", "Kary Banks Mullis (Himself - PhD, Nobel Laureate in Chemistry 1993)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
