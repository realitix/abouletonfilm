What is left is a double portrait, in which neither Dore 0. nor the grand landscape remain unchanged. The cold of the icy coastline - long shots of stones, snow and the sea - dwindles away before the image of Dore 0. Solitude is superflous, when the grandiose mountain meadow invites somersaults.  ... In this case Nekes handles what he shows considerately. He releases the objects he portrays. He allows them to unfold. And so model and patterns actually serve another purpose: to let poetry grow, and energy and beauty and confidence nell'abbandono.\" (Dietrich Kuhlbrodt, Filmkritik, 9/1971).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8fuKIQglO8WwkOdrnesXVa1IGYl.jpg", "actors": ["Dore O.
