Brown essays the title role of Chip Bennett, foreman of the Flying U ranch. Before the second reel has tumbled over the spools, Chip finds himself falsely accused of robbery and murder. The actual miscreants are in the employ of a band of foreign gunrunners, who speak in heavily Teutonic accents. Rest assured that Chip makes short work of these bush-league Storm Troopers before the sun sets in the West. Musical interludes are provided by a group calling themselves the Texas Rangers, even though they actually hailed from Kansas City.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1x4qRiPwkogaA29IivmuoWXaWKV.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Mack Brown ('Chip' Bennett)", "Bob Baker ('Dusty')", "Fuzzy Knight ('Weary')", "Doris Weston (Margaret Whitmore)", "Forrest Taylor (J.G.
