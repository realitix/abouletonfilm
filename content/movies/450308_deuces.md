Nice to see Larenz Tate in a lead role again.\r\n\r\nA bit like 'In Too Deep (1999)' but flashier (but not as great).\r\n\r\nOne too many montages and slow-motion scenes perhaps though. And too much Meghan Goode, but any amount of Meghan Goode is too much Meghan Goode really.\r\n\r\nAside from 2 or 3 mumble rap bs songs mostly good soundtrack: Nas, Shuggie Otis and Aloe Blacc for instance set the mood.\r\n\r\nDebating on wether it's a 3.5 or a 3 out of 5 star... I'd say it's a 6.5/10 so I'll go with a light 3.5. Either way if you enjoy undercover movies about gangstas and cops then it's not too shabby."}], "recommandations_id": [419303, 455599, 461698, 347956]}
