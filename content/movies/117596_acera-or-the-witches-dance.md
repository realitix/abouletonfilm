They rest in mud; then, in water, they dance, their skirt-like hood spreading like a dervish's cassock. They spin and spin. The film adds musical accompaniment. We watch them mate and secrete eggs: acera are both male and female, and can form chains with other acera in which they simultaneously mate as a male and as a female. The eggs hatch, and the cycle begins again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cdwVC18URfEdQjjxqJyRMoGDC0H.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
