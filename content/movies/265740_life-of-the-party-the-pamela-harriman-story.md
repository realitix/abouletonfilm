While not showing her childhood, first marriage to Winston Churchill's son, or most of her affairs, we do get to see her affair and eventual marriage to Broadway producer Leland Hayward, and then her marriage to politician Averell Harriman, with whom she had an affair while both were married to others in World War II. We also see her as ambassador to France during her last years, and her death in 1997. While some (mostly her lovers) adored her, others (mostly her son and her husbands' children) hated her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aJUISGrLuY6thiCgLwczu5A4whF.jpg", "actors": ["Ann-Margret (Pamela Harriman)", "Mitchell Ryan (Averell Harriman)", "Gail Strickland (Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney)", "Natalie Radford (Pamela Harriman at 20)", "John DeMita (Peter Duchin)", "Susan Ruttan (Janet)", "Sydney Walsh (Minnie Churchill)", "Joan Severance (Paley)", "Cynthia Harris (Kathleen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
