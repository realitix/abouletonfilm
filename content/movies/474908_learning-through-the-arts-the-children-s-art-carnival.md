The narrator and director of the program, Betty Blayton Taylor, asserts that art is everywhere in people's lives and that an understanding of the arts motivates children in other aspects of their lives...The documentary illustrates how children, once they become curious, motivate themselves by wanting to read and communicate effectively.
