There is something for everyone in this ensemble piece about a close knit group of friends and the events that take place on New Years 1999. Most people believe that finding love is the greatest thing than can ever hapen to you, but some believe it is nothing but a fascist dictator that rules over your life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wY1Ixteftn9s0CTx8v9ri1ZVjKf.jpg", "actors": ["Domini Calder (Maddi)", "Steve Jorgenson (Nick)", "Seth Flynn (Dammon)", "Caroline Mitchell (Vicky)", "Craig Fenwick (Daryl)", "Andy Conlan (Anton Del Toro)", "Virginie Le Brun (Lisa)", "Matthew Saville (Travis)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
