Deep pillows and Alaskan spines, all filmed at night, with massive lights, custom made LED suits, and a national governments worth of logistics, planning, and civil engineering. Filmed as a partnership between Sweetgrass Productions, Philips TV, and the Swedish Agency Ahlstrand & W\u00e5llgren, it's two parts creativity, one part branded content, and a pinch of masochism for good measure. Overall, it's an incredibly unique partnership between our vision of skiing and the color and light technology behind the Philips Ambilight TV.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/boRgloB7H7icWLgiDyrdc90FRdl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
