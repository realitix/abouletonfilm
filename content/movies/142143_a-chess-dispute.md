One drinks and smokes, and when he looks away, his opponent moves two pieces. A fight ensues, first with the squirting of a seltzer bottle, then with fisticuffs. The combatants wrestle each other to the floor and continue the fight out of the camera's view, hidden by the table. The waiter arrives to haul both of them out.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qlWDZzcMRbAdmZiq7FRgaFHHdDB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [180139, 174097, 143770, 195074], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
