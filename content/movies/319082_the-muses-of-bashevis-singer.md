An exclusive discovery of the filmmakers brings to light a hitherto unknown chapter of his life. In the mid 1960's Bashevis Singer established an army of female translators - more than forty women - who helped spread his work. He chose his translators carefully, was inspired by their presence, often falling in love with them. Nine of the women who were intimately familiar with the man and work are still here. Theirs will be the only voices heard in the film, as they allow us a glimpse into his complex personality and personal life.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
