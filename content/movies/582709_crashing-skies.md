A farmhouse stands in a copper field of scratched emulsion as solarized flares illuminate the sky. Split toned horses amble dreamlike across the frame into inky underexposed blackness. Copper thistles sway in the wind, looming and strangely monumental. The hand-processed 16mm imagery creates an elliptical inner world of memory and dreams.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aazZ4cj7u9QgljSXdHKyc75f5kz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
