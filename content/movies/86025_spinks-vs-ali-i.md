Spinks won the world heavyweight title in only his eighth fight, the fastest ascent in history. An aging Ali had expected and wanted an easy fight, but he was out-hustled by Spinks, who did not seem to tire throughout the bout. It was one of the few occasions when Ali had left with a bruised and puffy face. Spinks victory over Ali was to be the peak of his career. Spinks became the only man to ever take a title belt from Muhammad Ali in the ring (Ali's other four losses were non-title contests). Spinks' iconic gap-toothed grin was featured on the cover of the February 19, 1978 issue of Sports Illustrated.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hkAjE5BxZITqEXVQ195EGRQCRoM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
