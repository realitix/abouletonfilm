These gangs ruled the Hong Kong night for decades, through controlling prostitution, drug trades and illegal gambling. It was during the 90's when their lifestyle came under threat as the Hong Kong handover to China drew near... This is the story based on real events of a college graduate who chose a life of crime over a future of boundless potential to push the Triads through the tough times during the 90's into the new millennium.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Ao9VSzmqXxZMbqVsqvp15ZPVIlD.jpg", "actors": ["William Chan Wai-Ting (William)", "Derek Tsang (Xiang)", "Michelle Wai (Michelle)", "Patrick Tam (Patrick)", "Irene Wan (Irene)", "Carl Ng (Bobby)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
