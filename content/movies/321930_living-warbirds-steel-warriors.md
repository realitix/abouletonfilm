Featuring dramatic footage of these and dozens more warplanes taking off, flying and landing, this film eschews narration and music in order to showcase the thrilling roar of these mechanical marvels in action.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
