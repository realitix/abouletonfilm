In doing so, he becomes friendly with Harold Armytage, a peacetime actor of the old school. Hearing that Charley has no job to go to when demobilized, Armytage suggests they team up as stage comics. Things are not easy; jobs are few and far between, and when they can be found they are in the tattiest of theatres, but Charley gains the experience he needs. They then decide to try their luck in London.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sadHcdpEX0lKUQZ0kZaLBg6I3T.jpg", "actors": ["Max Bygraves (Charley Moon)", "Dennis Price (Harold Armytage)", "Michael Medwin (Alf Higgins)", "Florence Desmond (Mary Minton)", "Shirley Eaton (Angel Dream)", "Patricia Driscoll (Rose)", "Charles Victor (Miller Moon)", "Reginald Beckwith (Vicar)", "Cyril Raymond (Bill)", "Cyril Raymond (Stewart)", "Newton Blick (Monty Brass)", "Vic Wise (Solly Silvers)", "Lou Jacobi ()", "Eric Sykes (Brother-in-Law)", "Bill Fraser (Marber)", "Brian Oulton (Mr. Paxton)", "Stuart Saunders (Sergeant)", "Stuart Saunders (Sid)", "Michael Dear (Young Soldier)", "Jane Asher (Benesta)", "Marianne Stone (Silvers' Secretary)", "Lesley Scoble (Uncredited)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
