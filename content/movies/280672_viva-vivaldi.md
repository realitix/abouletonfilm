Given with the early music ensemble Il Giardino Armonico before a very appreciative audience in the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, the performance is part of Bartoli's exploration of the Venetian composer's opera music which also includes The Vivaldi Album. There is a startling dynamic energy, which contrasts powerfully with the more restrained interpretations by singers such as Emma Kirkby. Bartoli's natural Italian and the live atmosphere of Maria Grazia d'Alessio's oboe gives her interpretation of the quietly haunting and melodically rich \"Non ti Lusinghi la Crudeltade\" from Tito Manlio a particular piquancy. The Flautino Concerto is a most attractive interlude, while the more famous Lute/Violin Concerto beguiles with its exquisite lyricism.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9v6NORrf6lClYUn3qde3KMM8TEg.jpg", "actors": ["Cecilia Bartoli (herself)", "Giovanni Antonini (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
