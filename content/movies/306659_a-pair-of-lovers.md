And so, for that reason, he wishes to marry off his son Hermann with his well-off girlfriend Helga.  But Hermann is in love with the farmer\u2019s daughter Dorothea.  He leaves his father\u2019s estate with her and makes his way to Berlin to make a name for himself.  He\u2019s not successful in this and, so as not to stand in his way, Dorothea leaves him.
