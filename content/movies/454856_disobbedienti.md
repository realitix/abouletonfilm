The \u201cTute Bianche\u201d were the white-clad Italian activists who used their bodies \u2013 protected by foam rubber, tires, helmets, gas masks, and homemade shields \u2013 in direct acts and demonstrations as weapons of civil disobedience. The Tute Bianche first appeared in Italy in 1994 in the midst of a social setting in which the \u201cmass laborer,\u201d who had played a central role in the 1970s in production and in labor struggles, was gradually replaced in the transition to precarious post-Fordist means of production. \u201cDisobbedienti\u201d thematizes the Disobbedienti\u2019s origins, political bases, and forms of direct action on the basis of conversations with seven members of the movement.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rJbNKmUgUrmzcxTg49DIYXivvMI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
