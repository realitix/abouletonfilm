The plot revolves around Sabrina (Melissa Joan Hart) having to move from Massachusetts to live with her two eccentric aunts in Rockland County, New York, where she starts attending Riverdale High, becomes besties with Marnie (Michelle Beaudoin) and contends with requisite mean girl, Katy Lemore (Lalainia Lindbjerg). After her 16th birthday, Sabrina learns she\u2019s a witch and grapples with the morality of having powers other mortals don\u2019t.\r\n\r\nThe tone of the production is decidedly pedestrian in a mid-90\u2019s TV manner, but the cast brightens things up with their energy and a decent script. (It was amusing to learn why Salem can talk and other cats can\u2019t). I\u2019ve probably watched a dozen episodes of the subsequent series and the main draw was always Melissa\u2019s winsomeness. She was 19 years-old when this pilot was shot and just got more beautiful over the course of the series. For those interested, Ryan Reynolds has a significant role; he was 18-19 during filming.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 31 minutes and was shot in British Columbia with some establishing shots done in Brookline, Massachusetts (or so IMDb says).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"}], "recommandations_id": [33271, 32874, 50326, 55328], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
