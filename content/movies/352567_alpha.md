At the centre is Alpha, whose scepticism about fixed appellations is also expressed in his own chosen name. In his Parisian garret, the characters debate politics, art and philosophy and negotiate Black identity and cultural heritage. The action continues on its improvised way in the caf\u00e9s, parks and nightclubs of Paris until Alpha finds himself between the fireworks and the celebrating masses on Bastille Day \u2013 in the middle and yet on the margins.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["James Campbell ()", "Emilia X.
