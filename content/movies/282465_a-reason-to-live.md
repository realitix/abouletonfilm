I suppose it has a message of faith and hope in it ... it does for me .... But then again my interest may not match yours. It was shot in San Francisco and in Central Oklahoma with a cast of one man and four women. Crushing emotions are indulged in against a massive meteorological background that brings inspiration and terror to the characters involved.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vVheW6044PfbBftHku9QkpUxoBN.jpg", "actors": ["Maxine Duff-Davis ()", "Marion Eaton ()", "Curt McDowell ()", "Marion Smith ()", "Robbie Tucker ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
