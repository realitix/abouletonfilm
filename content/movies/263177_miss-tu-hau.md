TU HAU, is a product of the countries fledgling film industry which took rise during the war years. MS. TU HAU tells the story, as the narrator explains, of a \u201csimple but exciting life of a genuine South woman.\u201d Not so simple really, but exciting nonetheless. Tu Hau is a common woman from a fishing village whose husband has gone away to fight in the revolution. She takes care of her young daughter as well as her aging father-in-law. Soon, her peaceful village is attacked. From there a series of tragic events would befall Tu Hau. Each one would challenge her will. She survives so she can continue to raise her child. As a midwife, she puts aside her own grief to assist in a neighbor\u2019s childbirth. Eventually her hardships drive her to join the resistance and ultimately makes the difficult sacrifice of leaving her child behind so she can help lead the front.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sf0y5lVymzZLNe1hX6g90aZoKdX.jpg", "actors": ["Tr\u00e0 Giang (Tu Hau)", "Tr\u1ea7n Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng (Husband Tu Hau)", "Henry Ph\u00fac (French Minister)", "Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n C\u1ee7a ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
