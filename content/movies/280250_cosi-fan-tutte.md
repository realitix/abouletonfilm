The officers thus pretend to go off to war, and return in disguise as Albanian strangers, to woo Dorabella and Fiordiligi incognito. The ladies are initially frosty, but soon warm to their new suitors, spurred on by their maid Despina. Performed at the La Scala Theatre in Milan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iWZVOLjPfnsK70Sr2CsbSvqPzyh.jpg", "actors": ["Daniela Dess\u00ec (Fiordiligi)", "Delores Ziegler (Dorabella)", "Jozef Kundlak (Ferrando)", "Alessandro Corbelli (Guglielmo)", "Claudio Desderi (Don Alfonso)", "Adelina Scarabelli (Despina)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
