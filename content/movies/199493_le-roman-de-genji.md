Based on a long-popular novel by Murasaki Shikibu, the film stars Kazuo Hasegawa as Genji, the illegitimate offspring of a Japanese potentate. Seemingly irresistible to women, Genji accepts the philosophy of \"love 'em and leave 'em\" as a matter of course. Only when his heart is broken by Awaji (Machiko Kyo) does Genji realizes how much pain he himself has caused. Visually, the film is a feast, capturing its 8th-century time-frame with pinpoint accuracy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cMbS9OLVdtctxyTDtb2t6sAqD8V.jpg", "actors": ["Kazuo Hasegawa (Hikaru Genji)", "Michiyo Kogure (Fujitsubo)", "Machiko Ky\u014d (Awaji no ue)", "Mitsuko Mito (Aoi no ue)", "Nobuko Otowa (Murasaki no ue)", "Y\u00fbji Hori ()", "Denjir\u00f4 \u00d4k\u00f4chi ()", "Yumiko Hasegawa (Oborozukiyo)", "Chieko Soma (Kiritsubo)", "Yuriko Hanabusa (Kiritsubo's mother)", "Chieko Higashiyama (Lady Kokiden)", "Kentaro Honma (To no Chujo)", "Ichir\u00f4 Sugai (Minister of the Left)", "Eitar\u00f4 Shind\u00f4 (Minister of the Right)", "Osamu Takizawa (Emperor Kiritsubo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
