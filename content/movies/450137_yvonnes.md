He is now 42 and has not seen his daughter for a long time. One day, he takes the train to go and see her, not even knowing if he will be welcome. The time of the journey will be like his lifetime. Time without an apparent conclusion, where everything is mixed up in the chaos of his acts, the consequence of a lust for life and poor choices. It is a non-linear time, with chronological return trips that correspond only to the energy of the protagonist. More a mental time than a real time. The editing is king. And with it a single character, plus a few supporting roles.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
