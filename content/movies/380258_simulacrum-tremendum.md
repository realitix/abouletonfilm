Because it is so long and the maker is Filipino, you might think he is following in the footsteps of Lav Diaz, but this is very different, more experimental, documentary-surrealistic cinema. A collection of images like Jonas Mekas also makes, although Manila is not New York.  Khavn started shooting this diary 22 years ago, and in the course of time he has made recordings with all sorts of cameras, from analogue video8 via mini-DV to iPhone. He does not present the recordings in chronological order, however.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tuYw2DnRClpdSVOi3OWVdK2Pf3T.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
