After that, Jango lived in exile in Argentina, where he died in 1976. The circumstances of his death in the neighboring country were not well explained today. His body was buried immediately after his death, raising the suspicions of premeditated murder. This documentary brings the issue back to the fore and tries to publicly clarify some obscure facts of the history of Brazil.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5jq7uX323s8grG2iNtNJ49o4LTe.jpg", "actors": ["Jo\u00e3o Goulart ()", "Carlos Diegues ()", "Carlos Heitor Cony ()", "Leonel Brizola ()", "Waldir Pires ()", "Zelito Viana ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
