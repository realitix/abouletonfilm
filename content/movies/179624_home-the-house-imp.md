Fumiko (Yasuda), the wife,  is unhappy at the change and doesn\u2019t get on with her elderly neighbours, Azumi (Hashimoto) is sad about having to transfer to a new school. Koichi\u2019s mother, Sumiyo (Kusabue), rather likes the new community while young Tomoya Takahashi (Hamada) really enjoys the new move because he can play outdoors.
