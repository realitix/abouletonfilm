It means that the tools in your bike repair class are locked to the table and that classrooms come equipped with panic buttons. It means that room assignments take gang affiliation into account. And it means that exposing your ignorance is seen as a weakness, \u201cbecoming prey,\u201d as one inmate-student describes it, in a world of predators. These are just some of the challenges that face participants in the San Francisco Sheriff Department\u2019s pioneering program to help inmates earn their GEDs. Local filmmakers Richard O\u2019Connell and Annelise Wunderlich trace students\u2019 progress from orientation to graduation in this timely and quietly provocative documentary.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
