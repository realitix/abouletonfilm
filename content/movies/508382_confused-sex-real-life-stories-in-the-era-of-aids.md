The 1st one is about the 70s, when Italian society discovered the \"sex, drugs and rock'n roll\" culture. Many witnesses are interviewed about their own experiences as drug addicts or sex consumers: mainly the incoming \"gay liberation\" politics are focused. The 2nd part is about the 80s: HIV comes to Italy from the USA and it becomes a tragic disease.

The 3rd part is about the 90s. Now the witnesses speak about the new \"life style\" of the Hiv-positive people: they don't die anymore, but can live thanks to new medicines, and so the problems are wider and more complex.
