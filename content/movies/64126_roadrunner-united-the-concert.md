It culminated in an album released worldwide on October 11, 2005, entitled The All-Star Sessions. Four \"team captains\" were chosen to lead 57 artists from 45 past and present Roadrunner bands, and produce and oversee the album's 18 tracks: Joey Jordison of Slipknot and Murderdolls; Matt Heafy of Trivium; Dino Cazares of Fear Factory, Asesino and Divine Heresy and formerly of Brujeria; and Robert Flynn of Machine Head and formerly of Vio-lence and Forbidden. The unprecedented project was the brainchild of Roadrunner UK General Manager Mark Palmer and Roadrunner USA VP of A&amp;R Monte Conner.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3GCXI2X3pzhhP3Qj1GNWofvvNAJ.jpg", "actors": ["Dino Cazares (Himself)", "Adam Duce (Himself)", "Paul Gray (Himself)", "Joey Jordison (Himself)", "Andreas Kisser (Himself)", "Robb Flynn (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
