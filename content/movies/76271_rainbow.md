Suffering more than most is Olga (Nataliya Uzhviy), a Soviet partisan who returns to the village to bear her child, only to endure the cruelest of arbitrary tortures at the hands of the Nazis. Eventually, the villagers rise up against their oppressors-but unexpectedly do not wipe them out, electing instead to force the surviving Nazis to stand trial for their atrocities in a postwar \"people's court.\" (It is also implied that those who collaborated with the Germans will be dealt with in the same evenhanded fashion).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dnpcT71sptJKVvcwk5gsgIBfDv3.jpg", "actors": ["Nina Alisova ()", "Natalya Uzhviy ()", "Yelena Tyapkina ()", "Hans Klering ()", "Anton Dunajsky ()", "Valentina Ivashova ()", "Anna Lisyanskaya ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
