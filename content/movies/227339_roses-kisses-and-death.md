There lives the beautiful Gabriella, who Christer loves, and an invitation to their engagement party is the reason for Puck and Einar to travel there. But the rose-scented idyll soon turn into a stifling background when Puck finds Gabriella's grandfather poisoned in his bed. Little by little we learn that the relations between the people living at the estate is everything but uncomplicated, and that there is a sexual frustration behind every well polished marriage. The question is to what extent beautiful Gabriella is involved in the intrigues and how much of a coincidence it is that her grandfather is killed just when Christer is in the house.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9ajIxrff7rwUDWyI5BwocbCzPRz.jpg", "actors": ["Tuva Novotny (Puck Ekstedt)", "Linus Wahlgren (Einar Bure)", "Ola Rapace (Christer Wijk)", "Anita Wall (Fanny)", "M\u00e5ns Westfelt (Fredrik)", "Lisa Henni (Gabriella)", "Anders Ekborg (Jan-Axel)", "Andreas Nilsson (Otto)", "Happy Jankell (Sofia)", "Alida Morberg (Gertrud)", "Andreas La Chenardi\u00e8re (Bj\u00f6rn)", "Karin Bergquist (Helene)", "Steve Kratz (Daniel)", "Filip Berg (L\u00f6ving)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [237863, 211885, 233198, 218031], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
