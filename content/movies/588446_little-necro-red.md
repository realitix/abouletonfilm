Angela's daughter, Annie (aka \"Little Red\"), mysteriously disappeared, but the police never found her body. Now, Angela's life is being plagued by inexplicable events. While Diane and Angela begin to shed light on the mystery, a masked maniac known as \"The Wolf\" is on the prowl, leaving a trail of blood and carnage in his wake. The further Diane and Angela delve into madness, the deeper the doubt burrows into their minds: is Annie alive?
