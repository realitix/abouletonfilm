Classic ski action cinematography at its best. Featured locations include Mammoth Mountain, CA, and an invitation-only spring racing derby; Mt Vernasus in Greece, which hosts a school for ski-ophytes; and some truly outrageous '70s freestyle action from Squaw Valley, Park City, Sun Valley, and Colorado's Breckenridge, Keystone, Copper and A-Basin resorts. Generous portions of Warren Miller's trademark humor and some crazy kaleidoscopic effects make \"Ski a la Carte\" the perfect sample of vintage 1970s Warren Miller.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vg7g4cW2P2zsQUHb96FGkbaf5vP.jpg", "actors": ["Warren Miller (Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
