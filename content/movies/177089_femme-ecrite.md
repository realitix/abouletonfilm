At the brothel where she used to go, Na\u00efm is struck by the beauty, the sensuous tattoos of young prostitute Adjou. He immediately feels bound in his flesh and soul to Adjou, a kind of mirror image to Mririda. Adjou\u2019s brutal murder triggers a police investigation. In his desperate search for truth, Na\u00efm sways between a world of imagination and reality.  Lazcen Zinoun is the conductor of a film composed like a five-movement opus framed by tribal rituals and practices like the mysterious, erotic tattooing of women.  He sings the hymn of freedom for women to control their own bodies in a society still paralyzed by ancient codes. He films Fatym Layachi\u2019s goddess-like body with the same poetry and lyricism as he does the sexual passion that enflames the lovers.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Hatim Abdelghafour ()", "Abdellatif Chaouki ()", "Abdelkrim Cheddati ()", "Sam Kanater ()", "Fatym Layachi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
