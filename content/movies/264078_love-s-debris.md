LOVES DEBRIS didnt have, and couldn't have had, any pre-planned action. There was no script, no continuity. On the other hand, there were precise constraints that provided the rules of the game: the setting, the Abbey of Royaumont, and the chosen participants. Each singer came accompanied by a person of his or her choice, and worked on an aria chosen by the director. And there was ELISABETH COOPER, a \"one-woman orchestra\", who transposed and played the scores on the piano and organ.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mtRlDJH3sfolmvbSb0tZ04gp2fc.jpg", "actors": ["Anita Cerquetti (Soprano)", "Martha M\u00f6dl (Dramatic Soprano)", "Rita Gorr (Mezzo-Soprano)", "Kristine Ciesinski (Soprano)", "Katherine Ciesinski (Mezzo-Soprano)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
