Director Sylvie Trouv\u00e9 examines how reflected images pervade our surroundings, how our senses filter out these ghost images and, finally, how the camera can capture emotions created by a shimmering puddle or a sparkling coloured glass surface. At the same time, Trouv\u00e9 raises a new awareness of our urban environment. The editing, which animator Theodore Ushev collaborated on in a spirit of mutual emulation, embraces an animation aesthetic that fully respects the filmmaker\u2019s artistic vision. While examining our relationship with images, this exploration of the city blurs the distinction between real-life shots and animation. Indeed, though inspired by reality, the film is thoroughly immersed in the world of animation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dz3I8JOXvUAWwgmiPGiUQlDuab9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
