Gas-station owner Gerhard Zehmann is saddled with cheating wife Regina Bill. The man would like to escape to Venezuela, but he can't unload his wife. Then he meets a woman who is the exact double of his wife (also played by Regina Bill, of course). Falling in love with this clone, the husband hatches a plan. He'll murder his wife, then leave for Venezuela with her look-alike so as not to arouse suspicion. Are foolproof plans like these ever really foolproof?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c5Q8xOSgWn8yiCVWTL3N90XJMUI.jpg", "actors": ["Regula Bill ()", "Gerhard Zemann ()", "Herta B\u00f6hm ()", "Christoph K\u00fcnzler ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
