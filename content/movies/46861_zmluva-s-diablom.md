The five girls first try to defend themselves, but when they find out that nobody believes them - neither the school principal nor even their own parents - they decide to accomplish what they have been falsely accused of. And although their clumsy attempts are mostly comic, at one point they almost cause a big tragedy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6ER6x0nI2aKaNa96xEyx8LWndrV.jpg", "actors": ["Sylvie Turbov\u00e1 (Aja Trnkova)", "Viera Simekova (Emka Durcekova)", "Ivana Karbanov\u00e1 (Marcela Pavelkova)", "Zuzana Koc\u00farikov\u00e1 (Olga Dvorska)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
