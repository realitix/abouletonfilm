That film was formulaic \u2014 largely a rehash of Aayiram Jenmangal \u2014 but the comedy (read Santhanam) and the kitschiness of the plot made it the kind of film one could politely dismiss as 'one-time watch'. Aranmanai 2 involves a different set of characters and plot, and still feels like a faithful re-tread of moments from the first film \u2014 awkward romantic track between two comedians, segment where the family tries to muster courage and divert the ghost (the one truly funny portion in the film), a group song that involves a comedy dialogue (Kuchi Mittai Kuruvi Rotti) and so on.\r\n\r\nThe plot involves the family of Murali (Siddharth), into whose mansion an evil spirit enters. His father (Radha Ravi) ends up in coma while his elder brother (Subbu Panchu) disappears. His fiancee's (Trisha) brother, Ravi (Sundar C) tries to solve the mystery and they learn that a ghost is responsible for the odd happenings in the place. And when they discover the ghost's identity, they realise it will not stop until every male in Murali's family is dead.\r\n\r\nDespite toeing so closely to the original's formula and being equally unpretentious, Aranmanai-2 feels underwhelming. The comedy is less funny (Soori takes over from Santhanam here) and the horror scenes not even remotely scary (though, the visual effects continue to be tacky). The cast and the director seem to be coasting along with a 'people will see this movie no matter what' attitude, and it is this blatant acknowledgment of the film being just a cash grab that is most disappointing."}], "recommandations_id": [349200, 362150, 357708, 368230], "youtube_key": "OSH18HWQZRw"}
