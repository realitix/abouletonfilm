When Ashleigh was hired to voice Apple Jack and Rainbow Dash for Hasbro's fourth series to use the My Little Pony name - My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic - she had no idea she would become an Internet phenomenon and major celebrity to a worldwide fan-base of grownups. Bronies are united by their belief in the show's philosophy. This documentary gives an inside view of the Pony fan-world, and an intimate look at the courage it takes to just be yourself...even when that means liking a little girls' cartoon.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ueKw9EKd2BULq2mOEMPeB87e36u.jpg", "actors": ["Ashleigh Ball (Herself)", "Mike Bernstein (Himself)", "Jordan Downs (Himself)", "Patrick Edwards (Himself)", "Andrea Libman (Herself)", "Bryan Mischke (Himself)", "Nicole Oliver (Herself)", "Donald Rhoades (Himself)", "Shaun Scotellaro (Himself)", "Andy Stein (Himself)", "Kelvin Williams (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [3149, 3210, 84372, 61702], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
