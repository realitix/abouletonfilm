The title refers to the expression \"gatlato al-rujula,\" or, roughly, \"machismo killed him\" and the film's mordant insights into male posturing and alienation in Algerian society animate this bit of folk wisdom. In mock documentary style, a young man recounts with wry commentary a typical day in his life in the Bab el-Oued quarter of Algiers, while the camera playfully shows a different story. In following Omar and his friends in their pursuit of happiness, the film examines with shrewd humor the gang values of urban youth; their passion for popular culture (soccer, \"Hindoo\" movies, Rai concerts), their hidden fear of women, and their social insecurity in an environment where they are marginalized.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yjguGSU9QIJbokF7uS4hPL9j24F.jpg", "actors": ["Boualem Benani (Omar Gatlato)", "Aziz Degga (Moh)", "Farida Guenaneche (Selma)", "Rabah Leghaa (Hamid Mechtak Maarifa)", "Abdelkader Chaou (The singer)", "Krimo Baba A\u00efssa (Dahmane Beeftack)", "Areski Nebti (The uncle)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
