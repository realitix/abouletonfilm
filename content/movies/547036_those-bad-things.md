These are the thoughts of a daughter who cannot rebel. As a little girl, she spent a lot of time with her mother, a fervent Catholic woman. She would have rather spent time with her father, but he was busy hiding an extra-marital affair everyone knew but kept quiet about. Today, time goes by slowly inside and outside their home. Family problems are silenced, the Campania region suburbs lie on the background.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gvYxiRv1SteL3tnYXqw6BcoxbjU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
