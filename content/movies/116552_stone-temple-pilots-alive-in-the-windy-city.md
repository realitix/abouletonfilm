The band are in top form and the show both looks and sounds spectacular. The concert was held shortly before the release of their recent Stone Temple Pilots album and the tracklisting combines new songs interspersed with their classic hits. This is a great live concert by one of the most successful rock acts of the last twenty years./ Line-up: Scott Weiland (lead vocals), Robert DeLeo (bass), Dean DeLeo (guitars), Eric Kretz (drums).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yA5t0C6uuK2txztdFlaYv7KP6HK.jpg", "actors": ["Scott Weiland (Vocals)", "Dean DeLeo (Guitars)", "Robert DeLeo (Bass)", "Eric Kretz (Drums)", "Stone Temple Pilots ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
