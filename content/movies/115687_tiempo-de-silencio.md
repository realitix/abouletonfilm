Nevertheless, his assistant, Amador, informs him that he gave some of the mice to an old trapper, nicknamed \u201cel Muecas\u201d, who lives in precarious conditions in a shanty town outside Madrid, and that this poor man has successfully bred them with the help of the natural heat of his daughters. The incredulous scientist goes to the shanty town to obtain the mice. There, Pedro meets Muecas, Muecas's wife Ricarda and their two daughters Florita and Conchi. With the warmth of the women\u2019s breasts, as the flirtatious Florita shows Pedro, the mice are able to reproduce.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ftqujQLXE1sJ6JEkuYrFQ2WXDry.jpg", "actors": ["Imanol Arias (Pedro Mart\u00edn)", "Victoria Abril (Dorita)", "Charo L\u00f3pez (Charo)", "Francisco Rabal (Muecas)", "Joaqu\u00edn Hinojosa (Cartucho)", "Juan Echanove (Mat\u00edas)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [88064, 59877, 38091], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
