The match was 27-seconds. But Lord, the road to that decision was no-where near as short. Political wranglings with McMahon and Savage would cause this swift end to a historic reign.  THE OPPONENT:  It may have been The Ultimate Warrior in the ring that night at the inaugural Summerslam but Honky\u2019s real opponents were, in actuality, all outside of the ring.  THE ANGLE:  Was it Savage? Jake Roberts? Beefcake? Warrior? Just what was the driving angle that led up to Summerslam? We will iron it all out here.  THE SHOT:  Head back to NYC for the first Summerslam and the fascinating and heartbreaking journey that got HTM there!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Sean Oliver (Himself)", "The Honky Tonk Man (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
