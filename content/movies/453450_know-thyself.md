We hear his deepest thoughts as he walks through the woods of Mohonk; this internal voice is punctuated by graphic glimpses of new grief, interruptive and savage. Gradually the man explores his feelings and the landscape together, almost unconsciously allowing nature to infiltrate his being. He finds a hill, a horizon, a viewpoint - no conclusion but perhaps possibility along with perspective.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Christian Coulson (Young Man)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
