Terrestrial is in part an attempt to articulate a desire to transcend bodily limits with things like mobile devices and machines etc. while acknowledging an unavoidable level of dysfunction.The film was inspired by an incident in 2014 where a Blue Line train in Chicago failed to stop at its final destination, the O\u2019Hare airport, and eventually came to a stop halfway up the escalator at the airport\u2019s entrance. Terrestrial reimagines this crash as an earthbound machine\u2019s failed takeoff.\u201d\u2014Calum Michel Walter", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lNy6asstqDOlYZ8sXDpMt6CacXz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
