It is about a girl whose first friend is a small drawing named Arita, a cute nosed endearment she found everywhere. From her notebooks to her illustrations and school supplies, Arita appeared silently and still. Growing up with such a friend would raise questions and as she became older, she attempted to answer them. Iwai, one of Japan\u2019s most exciting directors, tells a beautiful and dream-like story through the precious eyes of Ryoko Hirosue. The heavenly tint of the picture and the serene piano playing makes ARITA easily an audience favorite.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wds3U4abdkYzC7GuqO1RyRy2NVC.jpg", "actors": ["Ryoko Hirosue ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
