Linda, the daughter of Baron Danning, is about to marry the rich manufacturer\u2019s son, Walter Bertram, to save the Danning family estate from the Baron\u2019s debtors.  But her encounter with Markus is creating doubts about the sincerity of her love for Walter.  So she keeps pushing back their wedding, using as a pretext the demand, that she\u2019ll only marry when the now-silent church organ in the village once more plays.  But the organ builder Franz is in a dispute with his twin brother Joseph and has no time to fix the disused organ.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bsRHVXaxgI6MYUIqIWoTKqOrXjF.jpg", "actors": ["Paul H\u00f6rbiger (Franz Burgmann / Josef Burgmann)", "Gerlinde Locker (Baroness Linda von Danning)", "Hannelore Cremer (Petra W\u00fchrer)", "Wolf Albach-Retty (Baron von Danning)", "Sieghardt Rupp (Bruder Markus Burgmann)", "Dieter Eppler (Walter Bertram)", "Oskar Sima (Direktor Bertram)", "Franzl Lang (Leopold)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
