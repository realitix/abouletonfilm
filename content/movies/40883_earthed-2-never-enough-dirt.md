We traveled all over Europe, the USA and Canada riding backyard trails, gnarly singletrack, North Shore facilities and mountainous downhill tracks. Blowing out berms, launching huge transfers, and hitting fast sections this is bicycles and dirt at its finest! Earthed 2 also follows the World Cup Downhill race scene, NORBA races and the 2004 World Championships from Les Gets, along with the finest races Europe has to offer with unparalleled coverage from start gate to finish line, behind the scenes in the pits and at the bar during the after-parties.
