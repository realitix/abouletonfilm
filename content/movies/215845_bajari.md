For Barcelona's Gypsy community, it cannot be learned at a school or on paper. It is lived within the home, created at the bar and perfected on the street corner. Bajari goes to all those places with the dancer Karime Amaya-who is working with some of the most talented up-and-coming musicians and dancers to create an innovative show-and little 5-year old Juanito Manzano who takes his first steps to dance in it and earn his white flamenco boots. Their experiences form a journey of discovery of this living tradition and create an intimate portrait of how flamenco's legacy is kept alive within Barcelona's tight-knit Gypsy community.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oSquh4aPcmbeoXfEj5aSkEwkfoU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
