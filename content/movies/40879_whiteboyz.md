He practices in front of a mirror and with his two pals, James and Trevor. He talks Black slang, he dresses Black. He's also a wannabe pusher, selling flour as cocaine. And while he talks about \"keeping it real,\" he hardly notices real life around him: his father's been laid off, his mother uses Food Stamps, his girlfriend is pregnant, James may be psychotic, one of his friends (one of the town's few Black kids) is preparing for college, and, on a trip to Chicago to try to buy drugs, the cops shoot real bullets. What will it take for Flip to get real?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k5hHP3JaD6wak6ovkuZL7Ggqzyz.jpg", "actors": ["Danny Hoch (Flip)", "Piper Perabo (Sara)", "Dr. Dre (Don Flip Crew #1)", "Fat Joe (Don Flip Crew #2)", "Eugene Byrd (Khalid)", "Dash Mihok (James)", "Mark Webber (Trevor)", "William N.
