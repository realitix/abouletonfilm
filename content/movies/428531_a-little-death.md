What seems at first to be a quiet arrangement of a dead hare and peach on a table starts to decompose before our eyes. Rather than attempting to capture a moment in time, the viewer is put face to face with a speeded up decomposition of the subject matter. Taylor-Wood brings home the transience of biological life, and the viewer's mortality. This work explores the issue of temporality, an idea which permeates the artist's oeuvre, where a course of action can change radically even within the space of a few seconds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ilfKECoh6gIooeofWXuiaS2gkdh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
