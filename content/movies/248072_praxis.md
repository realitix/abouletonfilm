Brian, a writer on the verge of a breakdown, is aided by Joe and an Elusive Woman as he sifts through the fragments of his persona to discover his true core. Fighting against fear and the indifference of society - aptly symbolized by the medical establishment - his quest reflects the classical mythos of Proteus and the human search for meaning in the universe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A1qamwBfNrqv1tOPkPhFX7NZ2a7.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Macy (Brian)", "Andrew Roth (Joe)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
