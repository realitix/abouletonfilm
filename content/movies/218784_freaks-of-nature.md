All the folklore characters in one place!**\r\n\r\nA much better film than I expected. There's everything in it, all the popular folklore characters in one screen. In addition to that the aliens have also made into it, totally something new. Do think only Marvels bring all its superheroes in one place, see this some B movie did it as well. Since you know where this film belongs, I mean like a second string film, you should expect to a same level in order to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nFirst, the writer and director did a good job, followed by the actors. There were three main characters and they were distinct from each other. The supporting cast as well, so good, many decently known names were in that. The story as well had some good twists, since so many concepts was merged, predicting the scenes were kind of impossible. Anytime anything might happen, but overall it was a very well done film. So an enjoyable film with a few laughs.\r\n\r\nIt is the best year so for if you like B movies, Recent films like 'Cooties', 'Scouts Guide...' and a few others, you won't get a treat like this every year. They all are not top notch, but very entertaining, even if you rate them average. So what I'm saying is, this film is not those big production house's big projects, but it delivered to its capacity and you must keep that in your mind while watching it. I can't suggest it, but I hope you watch it.\r\n\r\n_6/10_"}], "recommandations_id": [241843, 273477, 293970, 257117]}
