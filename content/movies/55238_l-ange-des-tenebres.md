L'action s'ouvre sur une sc\u00e8ne dat\u00e9e d'octobre 1942 : le drapeau norv\u00e9gien flotte alors au-dessus de la kommandantur, mais tous les habitants du village sont morts. Un flashback retrace alors la suite d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements qui a amen\u00e9 ce modeste village \u00e0 d\u00e9fier l'arm\u00e9e d'occupation. Le m\u00e9decin du village, Martin Stensgard, et sa femme essaient de retrouver la vie tranquille d'avant-guerre et tentent d'oublier la pr\u00e9sence de l'occupant. Toutefois, si le Dr. Stensgard pr\u00e9f\u00e8re rester neutre, il est tortur\u00e9 par sa conscience de patriote. Son beau-fr\u00e8re, Kaspar Togersen, riche propri\u00e9taire de la conserverie locale, collabore sans \u00e9tat d'\u00e2me avec les nazis. La fille du Dr. Stensgard, Karen, fait partie de la r\u00e9sistance, dont le chef est Gunnar Brogge. Johann, le fr\u00e8re de Karen, est de retour au village car il vient d'\u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 de l'universit\u00e9..", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5bX9tW7Sr4TspXaxB1VAHTu194v.jpg", "actors": ["Errol Flynn (Gunnar Brogge)", "Ann Sheridan (Karen Stensgard)", "Walter Huston (Dr. Martin Stensgard)", "Nancy Coleman (Katja)", "Helmut Dantine (Captain Koenig)", "Judith Anderson (Gerd Bjarnesen)", "Ruth Gordon (Anna Stensgard)", "John Beal (Johann Stensgard)", "Morris Carnovsky (Sixtus Andresen)", "Charles Dingle (Kaspar Torgerson)", "Roman Bohnen (Lars Malken)", "Richard Fraser (Pastor Aalesen)", "Art Smith (Knut Osterholm)", "Louis V.

Because of it both being by Turner Classic Movies AND had one film directed by Lewis Milestone (with one of the finest anti-war statements ever made, 'All Quiet on the Western Front', under his belt) and the others by none other than Raoul Walsh, I was, pardon the pun, 'in like Flynn'. But as Flynn had been one of my favourite actors of the period simply on the basis of 'The Adventures of Robin Hood', I honestly would have gone for it anyway. Yeah, you could say I love older movies! =)\r\n\r\nMy best friend Earl remarked, 'By the end of WWII, they used up all of the good film titles,' and he probably has a point there, at least with this one, still getting quality usage THREE generations later, and with Mel Gibson to boot. But this was weird for a war film (looking at the resistance put up by a village of 800 Norwegians) bizarrely cast (with Ann Sheridan, Walter Huston, Judith Anderson and Ruth Gordon--all as the GOOD guys!), and had taped speeches by BOTH Churchill and Roosevelt. I read notorious British film critic Leslie Halliwell's review that everything was decent about the film except that it starred Flynn. He couldn't have been more wrong.\r\n\r\nI'm greatly looking forward to examining the other four films of the set, all directed by one of the most underrated American directors of all time--Raoul Walsh."}], "recommandations_id": [24041, 42493, 96255, 15310]}
