One of the camp directors, Jaroslaw, is a young professor who prefers the straightforward, intimate approach to students. He is opposed in his liberal views by Jakub, who likes to manipulate people. There is a confrontation from the beginning when Jaroslaw allows to attend the seminar a student who presents the views not according to the official line. In the end, a jury prize is given to mediocre paper, while the suspected school of thought still draws a recommendation. Finally the deputy rector arrives for the closing ceremonies, and since he disfavors the line of thought awarded by the recommendation the tensions rise. They climax when student in question bites the rector in the ear while receiving recommendation. The confrontation results in a scandal and the police is called in.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aXMu8QlVWoUE8zyS6mwuuHhsYrf.jpg", "actors": ["Piotr Garlicki (Jaros\u0142aw Kruszy\u0144ski)", "Zbigniew Zapasiewicz (Jakub Szelestowski)", "Christine Paul-Podlasky (Nelly Livington-Pawluk)", "Mariusz Dmochowski (prorektor)", "Wojciech Alaborski (Kiszewski)", "Mieczys\u0142aw Banasik ()", "Krystyna Bigelmajer (Zofia)", "Jadwiga Colonna-Walewska ()", "Alfred Freudenheim ()", "Marian Glinka ()", "Anna Grzeszczak (dziewczyna z kuchni)", "Iwona S\u0142oczy\u0144ska ()", "Krystyna Sznerr-Mierzejewska (Magda (w napisach: Krystyna Sznerr))", "Lech Emfazy Stefa\u0144ski ()", "Marek Wojciechowski ()", "Magdalena Zawadzka ()", "Eugeniusz Priwieziencew (Konrad Raczyk)", "Riccardo Salvino ()", "Andrzej Bartma\u0144ski ()", "Hanna Bieluszko ()", "Hanna Bieniuszewicz ()", "Ryszard Faron ()", "Mieczys\u0142aw Hryniewicz ()", "Ma\u0142gorzata Jarmicka ()", "Dorota Kami\u0144ska ()", "Tomasz Kami\u0144ski ()", "Ilona \u0141epkowska ()", "Karol W.
