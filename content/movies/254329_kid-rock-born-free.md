Rock will share his unique perspective on life and music as he spends time with his son, family and wide variety of friends. He will also go through final rehearsals with his Twisted Brown Trucker Band and squeeze in as much chaos as possible when he lights up a bon fire and throws a house party.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
