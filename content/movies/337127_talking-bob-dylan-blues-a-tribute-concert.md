All of the performers will offer their own individual view on Dylan's influence and significance to them personally. This concert, to be screened on BBC FOUR, assembles a broad range of singer/songwriters, bands and artists from the UK and the US inspired by the writing of Dylan, including revered UK folk guitarist Martin Carthy, American blues and folk legend Odetta, UK rock combo Razorlight, hotly tipped lo-fi blues folk singer Willy Mason and the 'Baird of Barking' Billy Bragg. Also featured are Liam Clancy, Robyn Hitchcock and Barb Jungr, with more artists to be confirmed. A songwriter for over 40 years, there is currently a renewed interest in Dylan's craft and in those early songs that came out of the folk tradition, leading up to the cataclysmic moment when he and the band went 'electric' in 1965.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6EJyDKxmSd3tY2VSpISprPyydZM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
