In 1949 Tom Riley is arrested for the murder of PC George Dixon. As he awaits interrogation at the station he is mysteriously transported into an episode of The Filth - a 1988 police series where the hard men rule. This black comedy questions whether the police have changed or is it the way film and television present them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/roEgIImxmh8Mfj8hVhmO8587dNl.jpg", "actors": ["Kenneth Cranham ()", "Karl Johnson ()", "Sean Chapman ()", "John Woodvine ()", "Ralph Brown ()", "Ian Brimble ()", "Nick Stringer ()", "Peter Lovstrom ()", "Barry Woolgar ()", "Anthony Smee ()", "Paddy Ryan ()", "Jonathan Chater ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
