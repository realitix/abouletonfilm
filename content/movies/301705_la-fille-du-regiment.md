In this action filled physical comedy, the beautiful tomboy Marie was found on a battlefield as a baby and adopted, not by one soldier but by an entire regiment. When Marie falls\u2014quite literally\u2014into the arms of the handsome Tonio, her military dads jump to protect her to stop a possible marriage. LA FILLE DU R\u00c9GIMENT may not be the composer\u2019s best work, but given a top-notch production with world class singing actors, it brings vocal thrills and an abundance of laughs, a combination that\u2019s hard to beat. The stars are Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez and Natalie Dessay, both unbeatable in bel canto roles, and both in top form here.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mYcdRyQebzYqGW7LPeLSEua770l.jpg", "actors": ["Natalie Dessay (Marie)", "Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez (Tonio)", "Alessandro Corbelli (Sulpice Pingot)", "Felicity Palmer (Marquise de Berkenfeld)", "Donald Maxwell (Hortensius)", "Dawn French (Duchesse de Crakentorp)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
