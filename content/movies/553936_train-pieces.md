Celestino is sleeping. From Dresden Hauptbahnhof to Berlin Zoo, \"branches cut against the sky like paint strokes\". Sounds, rhythms, machine landscape, smell of steel... I am obsessed by trains. On a train I am someone else. I am in another language. I am in the land of escape. Accompanied by that particular sound of steel reflected off sheet marble of thirties Roman buildings with the train approaching Roma Termini + a CD of Scanner, \"aranciata, birra, coca... aranciata, birra, coca...\" - A.T.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i48sumGX3VdqNiTDpF4Pr7aroye.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
