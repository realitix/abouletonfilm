They end up writing a hit and getting a recording contract. The trouble is, the composer's works are never played without another band member doctoring them up to make them swingier. Fortunately, the composer isn't too averse to the changes as he has just won the heart of the beauty who sings his revamped songs. Songs include: \"Where Did You Get That Girl?\" (Harry Puck, Bert Kalmar, sung by Helen Parrish), \"Sergeant Swing,\" \"Rug-Cuttin' Romeo\" (Milton Rosen, Everett Carter).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5HK2bvJJIm1wwBdfSQztNkSJiXf.jpg", "actors": ["Leon Errol (Alex MacDevin)", "Helen Parrish (Helen Borden)", "Charles Lang (Jeff Brant)", "Eddie Quillan (Joe Olsen)", "Franklin Pangborn (Digby)", "Stanley Fields (Crandall)", "Tom Dugan (Murphy)", "Joe Brown Jr. (Davey)", "Leonard Sues (Franky)", "Ken Lundy (Shrimp)", "Joe Cobb (Tubby)", "Billy Jack Elliot (Jack)", "Peter Sullivan (Pete)", "Thurston Hall (Stuyvesant, Four Star Record Co.
