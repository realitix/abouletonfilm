With Carriage Trade, Sonbert began to challenge the theories espoused by the great Soviet filmmakers of the 1920\u2019s; he particularly disliked the \u201cknee-jerk\u2019 reaction produced by Eisenstein\u2019s montage. In both lectures and writings about his own style of editing, Sonbert described Carriage Trade as \u201ca jig-saw puzzle of postcards to produce varied displaced effects.\u201d This approach, according to Sonbert, ultimately affords the viewer multi-faceted readings of the connections between individual shots. This occurs through the spectator\u2019s assimilation of \u201cthe changing relations of the movement of objects, the gestures of figures, familiar worldwide icons, rituals and reactions, rhythm, spacing and density of images.\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fnO3VkHA1wERoLrHVwykihBclyX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
