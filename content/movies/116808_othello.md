The story is set in the London of the near future, a crime-ridden metropolis virtually torn apart by racial hostilities. By order of the Prime Minister, black police officer John Othello (Eamonn Walker) is promoted to Commissioner, a post dearly coveted by Othello's friend, mentor and fellow officer Ben Jago (Christopher Eccleston). Seething with jealousy, Jago contrives to discredit Othello in the eyes of the public, and to destroy John's interracial marriage to the lily-white Dessie (Keeley Hawes). Among those used as unwitting dupes to gain Jago's ends are Othello's trusted lieutenant, Michael Cass (Richard Coyle), scrupulously honest police constable Alan Roderick (Del Synnott), and Jago's own wife, Lulu (Rachael Stirling).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ibIOygawh6JuNvI0OwmrsyKJ6k8.jpg", "actors": ["Christopher Eccleston (Ben Jago)", "Eamonn Walker (John Othello)", "Keeley Hawes (Dessie Brabant)", "Richard Coyle (Michael Cass)", "Rachael Stirling (Lulu)", "Del Synnott (Alan Roderick)", "Michelle Newell (Alma)", "Christopher Fox (PC Adey)", "Bill Paterson (Sinclair Carver)", "Carl McCrystal (Geoffrey)", "Tim Faraday (Chief Superintendent)", "Joss Ackland (James Brabant)", "Jon Snow (Newsreader)", "Claire Oberman (prosecuting counsel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
