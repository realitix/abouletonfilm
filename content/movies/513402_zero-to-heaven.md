Up and coming screenwriter Chip Long and his understudy, Zane, contrive a new narrative that will soon throw the two actors into a fictional maelstrom of fistfights, chases, vigilante priests, nun assassins and underground metal. As Ginger resists the urge to sign with Chip at Sean's insistence, Sean becomes a scribe of his own to enter battle with Chip over an epic yet impromptu script spanning from Texas to Disneyland. As the writers come head to head via their competing visions, only one author can claim victory as real bodies begin to pile up and fact and fiction become more and more blurred in this darkly comical and fantastic adventure.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/msFWKVAr7PK7Tp6WlxUeDzUyELV.jpg", "actors": ["Maralynn Adams (Ginger)", "Michael Fredianelli (Sean)", "Michael Nos\u00e9 (Chip Long)", "Brian Marquez (Zane)", "James Allen Brewer (Ricky)", "Carlos Gallegos (Joel)", "Joseph Camilleri (Father Armstrong)", "Nadia Latifi (Sister Margaret)", "Jeanne Young (Sister Agnes)", "Mick Hodder (Carl Powers)", "Brian Holm (Niles)", "Joan Boyd (Jocelyn)", "Vinnie Hecht (Lonny)", "Sean Johnson (Corey)", "Josiah Frampton (Ridley Striker)", "Bryan Botella (Chad)", "Anthony Gullicksen (Sage)", "Jade Ordonez (Sammy)", "Kiera Pietrangelo (Cammo)", "Franco Allen (Roscoe)", "Karolyn Cable (Amber)", "David Koerner (Kyle)", "Sandy Koerner (Small Princess)", "Nick Del Pozzo (Justin)", "Boynton Paek (Journalist)", "Dom Hecht (Jordan)", "Jeff Comstock (Scottie)", "Michael Widergren (Chet)", "Daryn Sung-Lee (Danny)", "Madeline Jasso (Heather)", "Mark John Ostrowski (Chef)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
