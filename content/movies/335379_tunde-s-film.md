Particularly effective are a pointless search by goon-like policemen, and a caf\u00e9 conversation between Tunde's friends, both of which do more to 'explain' delinquency than all of your glib sociological theorising. Like all neo-realism, Tunde's Film has the authority of performers re-enacting lived experience rather than acting.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hxWUIcQb1oyU3NzmjM11NrneJbO.jpg", "actors": ["Tunde Ikoli ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
