This time he finds himself haunted down by his own ravaging demons. His house, a dumping ground of horrors, is no longer the safe haven he thought it was, and his new victim, Sarah Wilson, may be his last. But while she lies tied up in Albert\u2019s house, the outside world spins its own web of deceit. Parole officer Michael Harris is too busy negotiating himself out of his own extramarital affairs to see through Albert\u2019s dark secrets. Darryl, Albert\u2019s neighbor, cries wolf at every turn and no one pays attention, when, perhaps, this time they should. All have a small part to play on this, the hottest, deadliest day of the summer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4qyJa7AMAnVKyVFzTxJa59lcIG5.jpg", "actors": ["North Roberts (Albert Mullin)", "Colleen Boag (Sarah)", "Matthew E.
