(So, what's your price?), it seems to be the constant over this excellent documentary work, performed by Olallo Rubio, a young Mexican director. The movie shows two faces of the same issue: the American influence in the Mexican culture. you will remain thinking after the movie ends. Everything has a price? Everybody has a price?, so, What's your price?. Strong and ancient differences between two distant-neighbor countries are discussed under each opinion. Both Mexican and American-common persons give its particular point of view about the other, but also about themselves. Developed with a extremely low budget, but with inventive and imagination, this movie shows many of the key aspects in the Mexican-American relationship. However, the movie is not just a compilation of statistics, the producers manage to make it fun too. That's one of it's good points. But never the only one. Well developed, absolutely recommendable.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/WK9ehj4nEMvJNmFaWgll54v9yL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [263148, 116305, 47298, 82136], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
