He meets four memorable artists: pop singer Jun Togawa, performance artist Rosa Tsukinoyo, collage maker Genqui Numata (who also calls himself \"The Bonsai Kid\" and \"The World's Greatest Artist\"), and dancer Saburo Teshigawara, the most exciting modern dancer/choreographer to emerge from Japan. The film explores a world populated not by soulless salarymen but by unique and brilliant creative spirits.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
