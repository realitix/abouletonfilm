His master, Ivan Ivanovich, a man far from being young, fond of hunting and nature, took a puppy to live with him, despite the dog's black ear being a \"shame of nature\" to his breed. The man always took his dog, whom he called Bim or Bimka, to hunting in country. Later, however Ivan Ivanovich began to have problems with heart and when the disease became worse was taken to a hospital. His dog couldn't bear waiting for the only person that ever cared for him and set out to find his master. Thus began the story of a homeless dog and his many breathtaking and exciting adventures, encounters of many people, kind and evil, and leads to an unexpected and heart-rending end.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7zoOvUg1CjsKYO0t9UzeOzkZZud.jpg", "actors": ["Vyacheslav Tikhonov ()", "Mikhail Dadyko ()", "Irina Shevchuk ()", "Mikhail Zimin ()", "\u0413\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0436\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 ()", "\u0420\u0438\u043c\u043c\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043d\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f ()", "Mariya Skvortsova ()", "Anatoliy Barantsev ()", "Valentina Vladimirova ()", "Aleksei Chernov ()", "Ivan Zhevago ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [270393, 49106, 127608, 90033], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
