The film turns out to be from planet Zog and when people see it, they are shocked and angered by the Zogs (or is it 'Zogians' or 'Zogites'?). It seems that they have their genitals where our heads are and vice-versa. To make things really weird, they eat and drink with their genitals and defecate with their faces.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rfMnwdrJ91xvHzxvzK4IR00rZHn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [125153, 85802], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
