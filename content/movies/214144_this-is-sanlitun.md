Sanlitun\u2019s social scene is enjoyed as much by self-consciously fashionable Beijingers as it is by foreigners, although the circumstances behind its big screen breakthrough in the independent comedy This is Sanlitun are very much in keeping with its status as the city\u2019s foremost ex-pat hangout. Icelandic director R\u00f3bert I. Douglas, who achieved early success at home with The Icelandic Dream (2000) and A Man Like Me (2002), has been living in Beijing for some years after seeing his local industry severely ruptured by the banking crash of 2008, thereby becoming familiar with the very haunts that crop up throughout his return to filmmaking. Rough around the edges due to its miniscule budget, This is Sanlitun makes a virtue of its technical shortcomings by employing the mockmumentary format to capture the dreams, schemes, and daily routines of Sanlitun\u2019s residents while also serving as a caustic cautionary tale about pursuing opportunity in a booming economy without understanding its culture.\r\n\r\nThe focus of Douglas\u2019 satire is Gary (Carlos Ottery), a broke Englishman who arrives in Beijing with ambitions of getting rich, winning back his Chinese ex-wife Lin (Ai Wan), and reconnecting with his young son Johnnie. Things do not go to plan as Lin is reluctant to let Gary back in her life in any capacity due to his track record of personal and professional failure, while a business meeting with a potential investor for his miracle grow hair product proves to be a disaster. However, the beleaguered entrepreneur does make a new friend in Frank (Christopher Loton), a self-proclaimed \u2018China expert\u2019 who offers \u2018mentoring\u2019 services to those in need of cultural indoctrination. Frank also helps the cash-strapped Gary to find a job as an English teacher, only for this financial lifeline to be jeopardized when he becomes the fixation of one of his students, Momo (Hu Gaoxiang). When his product suddenly takes off, Gary looks set for the fame and fortune, but his lack of concern for relationships and naivety with regards to contracts will leave him picking up the pieces once again. These characters often speak directly to camera, as do such supporting players as businessman Wang Ke (Cromwell Cheung) and language school proprietor Mary (Kitty Xu).\r\n\r\nThis is Sanlitun often plays like a checklist of experiences that will be all too familiar to anyone who has lived in China: Gary is employed to teach English based on immediate availability rather than credentials (\u201cWhat days can you work?\u201d/\u201cMonday to Friday\u201d/\u201cYou\u2019re hired\u201d), overpays for a bike, and is briefly used by Wang Ke to be the Western \u2018face\u2019 of a restaurant so that it can secure a backer. The film could have been titled \u2018Ex-Pat Dreams in China\u2019 as Gary is the sort of foreigner who turns up in the People\u2019s Republic in search of reinvention, only to have to settle for less, while Frank is evidently trying to establish himself as an Old China Hand. It largely hangs together due to the winning chemistry between Ottery and Loton as the former\u2019s perpetual anxiousness is well matched by the latter\u2019s deadpan calm. While such a double act is usually contrasted with more mature female characters, the impulsive Momo and judgmental Lin are just as confused, with Douglas showing how life\u2019s inherent messiness is amplified when such people attempt to cross cultural barriers. Brimming with spot-on observational humor, This is Sanlitun is a spirited comedy of cultural misunderstanding which offers a hilarious snapshot of West blundering into East with ridiculously unrealistic expectations."}], "recommandations_id": [84882, 157114, 5286]}
