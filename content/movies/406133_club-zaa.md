The new executive committee offers them the chance to bring fame and fortune to the school within the new first semester otherwise the new policy will become effective immediately. Unfortunately, the situation worsens when the new committee finds out about the \"Zaa Club\" party, and orders it to end. They fire Dong, the head of the club, in an attempt to quash the party. But whether the club's members can do anything to stop the committee and their killjoy policies remains to be seen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dE1GuHqyR3s0J1IPpbMMwgOaZmg.jpg", "actors": ["Pharanyu Rojanawuthitham (Dong)", "Jate Glernpratum (Oat)", "Worrawith Kaewpetch ()", "Chatthapong Pantanaunkul (Gangster leader)", "Yukonthorn Phinit (Pink)", "Sawinee Pookaroon ()", "Supatchaya Reunreung (Pang)", "Wanida Termthanaporn (Sally)", "Jarupon Tuakhreu (Yo)", "Chatuchak Wangsuwankij (Tueng)", "Boriwat Yuto (Tate)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
