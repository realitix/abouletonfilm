Constant fighting and car problems are just the beginning of their trouble, as they will soon discover that they are not alone on this road.  Two sisters, a duo of criminals and something much worse wait for them.  Their situation quickly turns from a move to trying to survive the horrors of THE HARVESTMAN.  Shot on location in Hays, Alberta with a budget that gives a whole new meaning to no-budget filmmaking.  The Harvestman was created by a group of people who share a love of movies.  With the help and support of a dedicated group of volunteers they crafted a homage to the grindhouse films of the 60s and 70s.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/289LC7JJoSjjl1508MRm6RD8tcZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "zI6LrUeNHgw"}
