A martial arts practitioner for nearly 20 years, Elvis used his karate expertise to enhance his already-powerful stage presence, and add a fresh air of physicality to his film roles. When \"The New Gladiators\" languished, fans missed out on an exciting opportunity to witness The King in a whole new light. In this film, Carman offers a tantalizing taste of what could have been one of Elvis' most unique and exciting cinematic endeavors.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/75QgmBxCSuRO4nlqqHfKzwx36kS.jpg", "actors": ["Elvis Presley (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
