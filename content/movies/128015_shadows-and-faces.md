A teenage girl is separated from her father, a shadow puppet master, when the two are forced to flee from their village due to escalating violence. Her attempts to find her father are intertwined with the consequences of an ever increasingly oppressive Greek regime. The story takes place mainly in a mixed ethnicity village, where the puppet master\u2019s brother lives. As the Greek regime becomes ever more repressive, tensions between some of the Greek and Turkish inhabitants arise. After a Turkish shepherd is shot in the head by Greek police violence breaks out between the neighbours and we see how  the two communities, who had once lived in relative harmony, sharing food, friendships and even love, are torn apart.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7rxATbRXtVeHeYDQVMNgypnZxkO.jpg", "actors": ["Osman Alkas (Veli)", "Popi Avraam (Anna)", "Mustafa Bolukbasi (Mustafa B\u00f6l\u00fckbasi)", "Hazar Erg\u00fccl\u00fc (Ruhsar)", "Settar Tanriogen (Salih)", "Cihan Toraman (Riza)", "Ekrem Y\u00fccelten (Arif)", "Bu\u011fra G\u00fclsoy (Ahmet)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "B1ZBmnLPYpU"}
