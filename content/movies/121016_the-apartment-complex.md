The tenants are all quite eccentric and uncommon characters, and the place is quite run down in certain spots. The previous manager had disappeared in mysterious circumstances. When cleaning the mucky pool, Stan encounters a corpse. The odd detectives that come to investigate seem to blame him. Then more bizarre, potentially deadly occurrences happen. Soon, Stan's life is in danger, if not his sanity.
