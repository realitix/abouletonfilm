The location is not fictitious but instead it\u2019s the very real Fermoy in County Cork which is a welcome touch. Like much of 1980s smalltown Ireland it\u2019s a claustrophobic place that drives people away but inexplicably retains a strange sort of hold on them. The latter is exemplified by Gina Moxley\u2019s character, the tempestuous Mary Hartnett who has returned after a stint in London. The other members of their gang are languid Martin (Vincent Murphy), uptight Willy, and mousey Rosie who carries a torch for Phil.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Liam Heffernan (Phil Kelly (as William Heffernan))", "Gina Moxley (Mary Hartnett)", "Vinny Murphy (Martin Hogan (as Vincent Murphy))", "Myles Breen (Willy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
