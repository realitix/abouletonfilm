It's the most entertaining of all, and it will be the best gauge for you to decide if you'd like to expand your collection with volumes 1 through 4. Volume 1 is no slouch, but from the very beginning (\"Chuck\" Heston explaining the MPAA rating system while playing tennis) Volume 5 is pure entertainment.\r\n\r\nAnother bonus is that the trailers are clustered together by genre; so, for example, if you don't like the Kung fu trailers, you can just skip ahead a few chapters and you'll be on to new territory."}], "recommandations_id": []}
