Home to world-famous events such as The Quentin Tarantino Film Fest, Fantastic Fest and Butt-Numb-A-Thon, the Alamo is one of the last places on earth where you can still see grindhouse classics such as THE DEVIL WITHIN HER and MAD MONKEY KUNG FU. Now, the Alamo has opened their vaults for a peek at some of the most outrageous cinematic gems from several golden ages of sleaze cinema. Digitally re-mastered in high-definition from the actual reels that show every week at the Alamo, this exciting edition of the 42ND STREET FOREVER series is the most bizarre, the most terrifying and the most hilarious one yet!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i9tOyCKS72HsCA2Tq3E97onpzgm.jpg", "actors": ["Matthew Kordelski (Himself)", "T.

It's the most entertaining of all, and it will be the best gauge for you to decide if you'd like to expand your collection with volumes 1 through 4. Volume 1 is no slouch, but from the very beginning (\"Chuck\" Heston explaining the MPAA rating system while playing tennis) Volume 5 is pure entertainment.\r\n\r\nAnother bonus is that the trailers are clustered together by genre; so, for example, if you don't like the Kung fu trailers, you can just skip ahead a few chapters and you'll be on to new territory."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
