As usual, when it comes to these MTV live recordings, the sound and production is very slick and elaborate, constituting a rich framework for Nando Reis' music. Worth special mention here are the versions of some of his own tracks that were previously recorded by other artists, such as \"Relic\u00e1rio,\" \"All Star\" and the beautiful \"O Segundo Sol\" (all three by C\u00e1ssia Eller) and \"Do Seu Lado\" (Jota Quest). The old Tit\u00e3s material is also excellent, as for example the hit \"Cegos do Castelo,\" the reggae \"Marvin\" and the slightly odd but humorous \"N\u00e3o Vou Me Adaptar.\" The mildly meditative \"Mantra\" is another highlight. On \"Pomar\" Reis is joined by the young band Ultramen from Rio Grande do Sul. The fine production and excellent song material make this perhaps Nando Reis' strongest effort as a solo artist.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ndzXcObpL33AOBm6yp7pO0WZlyl.jpg", "actors": ["Nando Reis ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
