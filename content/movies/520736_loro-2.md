Additionally, \"Loro\" wishes to tell the story of some Italians, fresh and ancient people at the same time: souls from a modern imaginary Purgatory who, moved by heterogeneous intents like ambition, admiration, affection, curiosity, personal interests, establish to try and orbit around the walking Paradise that is the man named Silvio Berlusconi.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ownWAXr4egDy9nAa2jrtoWNpa5l.jpg", "actors": ["Toni Servillo (Silvio Berlusconi / Ennio)", "Elena Sofia Ricci (Veronica)", "Riccardo Scamarcio (Sergio Morra)", "Kasia Smutniak (Kira)", "Euridice Ax\u00e9n (Tamara)", "Alice Pagani (Stella)", "Fabrizio Bentivoglio (Santino Recchia)", "Roberto De Francesco (Fabrizio Sala)", "Dario Cantarelli (Paolo Spagnolo)", "Anna Bonaiuto (Cupa Caiafa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [417670, 483184, 485894, 8832], "youtube_key": "UkX2MXJv4eY"}
