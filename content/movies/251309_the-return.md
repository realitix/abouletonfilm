The house has been all but abandoned since its previous owner, Gerald Harboys had been committed to an asylum for the apparent murder of his wife Muriel on their wedding night. Harboys had been obsessive about the physical perfection of women and, discovering that Muriel had had her right middle toe amputated as a child, had murdered her. But her ghost is said to still haunt the old house.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jq46qIlfXE5mLvohWeT1hXVkZcK.jpg", "actors": ["Rosalie Crutchley (Mrs Parks)", "Peter Vaughan (Stephen Royds)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
