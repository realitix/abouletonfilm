The film follows Yuki's visit to Tokyo in search of her missing brother, Hisashi, and their later reunion with Hisashi's ex-wife. Ichikawa's camerawork and plain sets draw out a more affectionate and gentle side of these characters and their connection amidst the barren Tokyo cityscape", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4YYYyLLwLx9Z0HbzGdpI9imJSCq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
