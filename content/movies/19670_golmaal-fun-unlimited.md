Laxman is an intelligent student who is not allowed to pass by his mischievous band of friends Gopal, Madhav and mute Lucky. This is because all four friends use his hostel room to conduct their activities. He is peer-pressured into running a series of scams in order to earn himself and his friends some money. Once thrown out of college bag-n-baggage, the naughty foursome finds refuge in the bungalow of a blind couple as their grandson. A cat mouse game unfolds as Laxman's body and Gopal's voice makes for Sameer (The grandson from US).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3ubefqLk26Gy0lXCfGIu8hQrBak.jpg", "actors": ["Ajay Devgn (Gopal)", "Tusshar Kapoor (Lucky)", "Arshad Warsi (Mahadev)", "Sharman Joshi (Laxmi)", "Paresh Rawal (Somnath)", "Rimi Sen (Nirali)", "Sushmita Mukherjee (Dadiji)", "Mukesh Tiwari (Vasuli bhai)", "Sanjay Mishra (The Don)", "Manoj Joshi (College Dean)", "Vrajesh Hirjee (The House Servent)", "Farid Amiri (Monty)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [44978, 19025, 20364, 14546], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
