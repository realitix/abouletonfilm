This show that took place on July 19, 1995 at the Brixton Academy in London, a venue with a capacity of about 5000, was the final of a total of four club shows. The other shows were held in Paris and Amsterdam, and all of them were recorded for a forthcoming album, which was eventually named 'Stripped' and released on November 13, 1995. Two songs from the London show made it on the album, namely \"Dead Flowers\" and the Bob Dylan-penned \"Like a Rolling Stone,\" with the latter also being released as the lead single off the album. \"Black Limousine\" and \"Live with Me\" from this show were chosen as the B-sides for the singles \"Like a Rolling Stone\" and \"Wild Horses,\" respectively. The full Brixton Academy concert was released on DVD and SD Blu-ray as part of the 'Totally Stripped' deluxe boxed set on June 3, 2016.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8NyKyhMij6eGYZvmyOu9FPWRtAR.jpg", "actors": ["Mick Jagger (Himself - Vocals, Guitar)", "Keith Richards (Himself - Guitar, Vocals)", "Ronnie Wood (Himself - Guitar, Backing Vocals)", "Charlie Watts (Himself - Drums)", "Darryl Jones (Himself - Bass)", "Lisa Fischer (Herself - Backing Vocals)", "Bernard Fowler (Himself - Backing Vocals)", "Chuck Leavell (Himself - Keyboards)", "Andy Snitzer (Himself - Saxophone)", "Kent Smith (Himself - Trumpet)", "Michael Davis (Himself - Trombone)", "Bobby Keys (Himself - Saxophone)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "p1XkcYlOgTw"}
