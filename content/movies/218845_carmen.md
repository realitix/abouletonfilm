The production features the three greatest exponents of their respective roles at the time: Grace Bumbry\u2019s magnificently seductive-toned Carmen, Mirella Freni\u2019s ineffably lovely, touching Mica\u00ebla and Jon Vickers\u2019s thrillingly manic-depressive Don Jos\u00e9.  On its release the film was hailed by Die Presse, (Vienna) as a \u201cunique artistic event\u201d, while Le Monde felt that Karajan\u2019s production brought \u201ca whole new dimension\u201d to the opera, \u201ccombined with a magisterial interpretation\u201d.  A classical and utterly dramatic approach to probably the world's most beloved opera \u2013 Karajan\u2019s Carmen is as much a delicacy for opera fans as it is a perfect starter for newcomers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5sYwecZ25T51tgg4nME0enodhIq.jpg", "actors": ["Grace Bumbry (Carmen)", "Jon Vickers (Don Jos\u00e9)", "Mirella Freni (Mica\u00ebla)", "Justino D\u00edaz (Escamillo)", "Julia Hamari (Frasquita)", "Olivera Miljakovic (Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s)", "Robert Kerns (Moral\u00e8s)", "Anton Diakov (Zuniga)", "Kurt Equiluz (Danca\u00efre)", "Milen Paunov (Remendado)", "Mariemma (Dancer at Lilas Pastia's Cortijo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
