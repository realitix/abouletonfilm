Fear not, for Lou Ferrigno and Rutger Hauer will show up briefly in the first five minutes and then be added into the closing credits in post-production! Michael Biehn will be unrecognisable in a completely disposable role he holds for all of two scenes! Even the guy who plays the role of Tyrion Lannister makes an appearance! Wait, sorry, I misread that. The guy who plays the role of the guy who plays the role of Tyrion Lannister in that one play that takes place in a different continent for a small part of a couple of episodes in season 6, makes an appearance.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, _Scorpion King 4_ cannot muster the action of the first entry or the humour of the third, but hey, at least it's not the second one.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}], "recommandations_id": [78049, 13486, 252360, 80410]}
