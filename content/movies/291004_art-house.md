When a university dean and an influential descendant of the original benefactor decide to turn the place into housing for varsity golf, the residents only chance of blocking the move is to prove their value and vitality as an artistic community. The burden is on art student Nora Ohr (Greta Gerwig), who is energetic, compassionate, but by no means perfect.
