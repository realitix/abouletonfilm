Her challenge is to walk the 60 kilometres of Iceland's most famous hiking route, a trail that just happens to end at the unpronounceable volcano that brought air traffic across Europe to a standstill in 2010 . With the help of Icelandic mountain guide Hanna, Julia faces daunting mountain climbs, red hot lava fields, freezing river crossings, deadly clouds of sulphuric gas, swirling ash deserts and sinister Nordic ghost stories as she attempts to reach the huge volcanic crater at the centre of the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull glacier.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sbARsnr5hT3r9g9tJzjKIxWCJit.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
