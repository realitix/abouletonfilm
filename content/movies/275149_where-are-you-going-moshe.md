The Jews of the little town of Bejjad plot their departure with the help of their rabbi. One thing, however, worries them: Will Berbeq\u2019ha, the idiot who thinks he\u2019s a general, leave too? Once he learns of the Jews\u2019 plans, Mustapha, the bar-owner, panics; if all the non-Muslims leave, the Law will make him close the bar. How will he avoid such a disaster? He\u2019ll have to hold back one Jew!
