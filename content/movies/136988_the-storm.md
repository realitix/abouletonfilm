Sure, many films and TV shows have portrayed what it was like for the UN forces. This film takes you into the melee from the perspective of Egyptians -- who were sharply divided about the war -- and their daily lives, which, as one sees, form the basis of their foundation for understanding/approaching the war. And it really is these \"every day\" realities that make up the bulk of the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4gNkm5NSvcqxgJ4tkF9aFhVKatF.jpg", "actors": ["Hani Salama (Ali)", "Hanan Turk (Hayat)", "Yousra (Hoda)", "Hesham Selim (Mahmud)", "Mohamed Nagati ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
