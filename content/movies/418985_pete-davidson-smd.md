The special is filled with Davidson's unfiltered, brutally honest anecdotes about smoking a Snoop Dog amount of weed, texting his mom dick pics, and his issue with male porn stars. From his stint in \"prehab\" to this one time at a Justin Bieber concert, Davidson proves that even at 22, he and his friends have had some high times and heavy experiences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l8DSvlkB6LCCfELTGZCzDHfDTHr.jpg", "actors": ["Pete Davidson (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
