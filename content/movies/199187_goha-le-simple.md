Omar Sharif stars as a na\u00efve young man who is taken for granted by friends and family. Little do they know that he has more intelligence, tenacity and imagination than all of them put together. The story takes an unexpectedly dramatic turn when the man falls in love with the young wife of his village's elderly \"wise man\". Based on an ancient Tunisian folk tale, Goha boasts impressive production values and sure-handed direction (by Jacques Baratier).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tYQwg7XqXdIHG5iQlub5JFWGz1x.jpg", "actors": ["Omar Sharif (Goha)", "Zina Bouzaiade (Fulla)", "Lauro Gazzolo (Taj-el-Ouloum)", "Gabriel Jabbour (Sayed Khamis)", "Daniel Emilfork (L'aveugle Ibrahim)", "Annie Legrand (Loulou)", "Fatna Bent'Lahsen (Chams)", "Hassiba Rochdi (La tante de Fulla)", "Ahmed Boule\u00efman (Le premier ma\u00eetre)", "Tahar Bel Hadj (Le deuxi\u00e8me ma\u00eetre)", "Mohamed Bel Hadj (Le troisi\u00e8me ma\u00eetre)", "Mohamed El Medeb (Le quatri\u00e8me ma\u00eetre)", "Zohra Faiza (Farideh)", "Claudia Cardinale (Amina)", "Mohamed Bouchakour (Mounir)", "Ahmed Bouraou\u00ef (Le barbier)", "Zohra (Anisseh)", "Salah El Meddi (Le p\u00e8re de Fulla)", "Ahmed Zogdan (Le patron du caf\u00e9)", "Fatma (Anisseh (uncredited))", "Ito Ben Lahsen (Chams (uncredited))", "Jean Laugier (L'\u00e9crivain public (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
