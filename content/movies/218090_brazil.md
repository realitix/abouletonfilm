In typical screwball-comedy fashion, the plot is set in motion by authoress Nicky Henderson (Virginia Bruce), who has hit the best-seller charts with her latest tome, Why Marry a Latin? While researching her next book in Rio De Janeiro, she finds out \"why\" when she meets handsome songwriter Miguel Soares (Guizar). Upon learning about Nicky's book, Miguel decides to teach her a few lessons in affairs of the heart. Edward Everett Horton is also on hand, twittering his way through the role of a well-meaning buttinsky. Thanks to the \"Good Neighbor\" policy of the 1940s, South American musicals were a glut on the market, but Brazil was good enough on its own merits to pay its way at the box office.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lDpqZLKRKv0jmLjJwSflOtKDcc0.jpg", "actors": ["Tito Gu\u00edzar (Miguel Soares)", "Virginia Bruce (Nicky Henderson)", "Edward Everett Horton (Everett St. John Everett)", "Robert Livingston (Rod Walker)", "Veloz (Veloz)", "Yolanda (Yolanda)", "Fortunio Bonanova (Senor Renaldo Da Silva)", "Frank Puglia (Se\u00f1or Machado)", "Roy Rogers (Roy Rogers)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
