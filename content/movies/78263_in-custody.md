Merchant 's treatment is wry and good humored , as his characters - an aging Urdu poet (Shashi Kapoor) and a worshipful young college lecturer - clash despite their shared passion for the beauty of words. Anita Desai adapted her novel with Shahrukh Husain, incorporating poems by Urdu author Faiz Ahmed Faiz. The movie won the President of India Gold Medal for Best Picture in 1994.(http://www.merchantivory.com/custody.html)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ehnQNdPijyud20msf4YsQEiJ2Y7.jpg", "actors": ["Shashi Kapoor (Nur)", "Om Puri (Deven)", "Shabana Azmi (Imtiaz Begum)", "Neena Gupta (Sarla)", "Sushma Seth (Safiya Begum)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
