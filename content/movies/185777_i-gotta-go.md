There are no preachy stories here. In fact there's no talking at all until a pediatrician and a producer (and mommy of three) make their appearances for less than five minutes at the end. Before that it's singing and dancing by bigger kids, potty-sitting by the youngsters, a diaper-wearing chimp doing both, and cartoon interludes. The songs address all aspects of potty training from washing hands, to sticker rewards, to toilet-training's role as a rite of passage. The reggae-drenched \"Bye Bye Diapers, Hello Fun\" and \"Me Potty Wotty\" are infectious and the rap-infused \"I Have the Power\" is positively soulful. By sticking with big kids as the inspiration rather than adults, this program may just inspire little ones to get on the potty--or at least get up and dance.
