He's a failed NYC indie rocker, and a failing booking agent. But he finds the potential of a small victory in a really bad idea. He decides to purchase a 1985 Lazy Boy on eBay, just like the one his dad had when Josh was a kid. He'll drive cross-country for the chair, staying with Emily at his brother's house on the way, and deliver it to his father as a surprise birthday gift. But when Rhett ends up coming along for the ride, it's three people and a giant purple puffy chair in a too-small van... and one of them has to go before the trip's end.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A8OdrYsEHhJDXWo8TC1EB0OmPkE.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Duplass (Josh)", "Katie Aselton (Emily)", "Rhett Wilkins (Rhett)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [118075, 23720, 82929, 238478], "youtube_key": "85cmTNBH42k"}
