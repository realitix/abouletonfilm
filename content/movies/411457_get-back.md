It didn\u2019t. Get Back documents the real story of the city\u2019s music outpourings, from post war years to present day. It\u2019s a story of a city where literally thousands of bands and artists, hundreds of clubs, promoters and managers put on the biggest, loudest and longest party in history. The golden era of The Cavern and Merseybeat generated a massive tectonic shift in popular culture and in the 1970s it started again with a new scene and yet another cellar club at its heart \u2013 Eric\u2019s. Bands such as Deaf School, Echo and the Bunnymen and OMD led the way. Then Frankie Goes to Hollywood, the Farm, the La\u2019s, the Christians. And more recently it continued, the city\u2019s bands always inventive and always re-inventing, with the Zutons, Coral, Wombats and more. The story is unending but Get Back offers music fans a chance to enjoy the narrative and the sounds created so far in the city that rocked the world\u2026", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/143zlUBXOJR3ycZAnQKMtIQZsLN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
