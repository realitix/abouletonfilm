If something isn't strange, he won't do it.  One day he meets Helen, and falls in love. This puts him in a dilemma, since love isn't strange at all... Or is it?  This film has everything... Loafs of bread, tooth brushes, keys, hats, a lawyer in a boat, some other people in another boat, a strangely painted cup, plastic animals in a train, real animals of various kinds, socks in the wild, the horizon, a big crazy fish (not real though), an incredible amount of whipped cream, a lamp post in love and some other stuff that you might have been waiting for.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ajIkdgDveWLXloiu3nqwJ0VxoCe.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
