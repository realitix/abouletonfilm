Spouse Jeff Warren is a successful author, Civil War scholar, and popular lecturer on the ladies club circuit. After Jeff buys aging twelve-year old nag Albert in the mistaken belief that he's a colt and Sally purchases a desk for her husband in the naive belief that it once belonged to Jefferson Davis, it's obvious that they have few interests in common. The squabbling is complicated by Jeff's jealousy of Sally's relationship with Lance Gale, her childhood friend, neighbor, and fellow horse breeder.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bIMAYi73xDN0FAXBBd4YnooHLRP.jpg", "actors": ["Barbara Stanwyck (Sally Apley Warren)", "Robert Cummings (Jeff Warren)", "Diana Lynn (Mary Lou Medford)", "Patric Knowles (Lance Gale)", "Peggy Wood (Grace Apley)", "Robert Benchley (Uncle Todd Warren)", "Willie Best (Joe)", "Natalie Wood (Carol Warren)", "Gregory Marshall (Johnnie Warren)", "Mary Young (Janet Doughton)", "Milton Kibbee (Hotel Manager (uncredited))", "Irving Pichel (Steeplechase Announcer (uncredited))", "Walter Baldwin (Mr. Hodges)", "Frank Orth (Judge)", "Mildred Gover (Mattie)", "Richard Gaines (Jeff's Attorney)", "Catherine Craig (Mrs. Medford)", "Ida Moore (Mrs. Walsh)", "Gertrude Hoffmann (Mrs. Harvey)", "James Millican (Kerwin Haynes)", "Larry Thompson (George Medford)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
