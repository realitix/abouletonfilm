There were improvements in the graphics, a more complicated storyline, and lots of new, tasteless humour. Many consider this to be the funniest of the old episodes, although Pirk's excessive swearing did raise a few eyebrows back int he day... Star Wreck III saw the first of the now traditional red-shirted security guard jokes.  Having wrecked his ship in the previous episode, Pirk now commands a brand new starship, and is sent to investigate a Romuclan attack plan on a backwater space station. It all ends with the most massive space battle in the history of the P-fleet, and it's lead by Pirk... With odds like that, does humanity stand a chance?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zRp5NTAtG84Ze1z3maJ6REYqvWl.jpg", "actors": ["Samuli Torssonen (Captain Pirk / Miss Puhura)", "Rudi Airisto (Mr. Spook / Hummer / Captain Dikhard / Chief Engineer Shitty)", "Janne Torssonen (Mr. Fukov)", "Petri Lehtinen (Romuclan Commander)", "Ville Hakkinen (Relevant Captain)", "Markus Paukkonen (Romuclan Navigator)", "Lauri Lepokorpi (Romuclan Commander In Vega System)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
