Party-girl Nora drinks too much, can't hold down a job and pushes away everyone she loves. After her long-suffering boyfriend throws her out, Nora is forced to return home to live with her aging father. Once inside her childhood home, the ghosts of her past begin to haunt her until the secret she has buried for so long is finally revealed. Centered around a terrible mistake and a shocking confession, Solitary takes an unflinching look at the price one family pays when they sacrifice the truth for an illusion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3GbkdEtBz8JDok2sU2VHImiaIja.jpg", "actors": ["Katharine Lee McEwan (Nora)", "Michael Wildman (David)", "Anna Skellern (Lisa)", "Fiona Hardingham (Maxine)", "Joe Calzaghe (Officer Flynn)", "Anita Dobson (Nurse Mary)", "Portia Booroff (Warden Pierce)", "Maya Bewick (Helen)", "Sam Hoare (James)", "Susan Ateh (Nurse Julie (voice))", "Miranda Bell (Nurse Betty)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ohH-YOvmzCY"}
