Overnight,his life (and his wife's ) change:not only his mates tell him stories to make his heart bleed to get some dough,but two aristocrats,a marquis and an earl,short of the readies,want the canteen man's daughter, a wise girl in love with a deserving young lawyer doing his military service,to become their daughter-in-law ,and to latch on to the girl's dowry.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xf01UVLnRuvvhLPoiT17pF89wo9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
