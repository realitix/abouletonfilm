During a raid at TV Asahi led by Daid\u014d Oda, who demands the release of their imprisoned leader, Seizan Tokugawa, Goro encounters his girlfriend Eri Hinata. She jogs his memory and he attacks his former comrades while getting Eri out of harm's way. This makes Oda reveal his true form as the Phylloxera Worm while his subordinates transform into the Acarina Worm, the Subst Worm, the Brachypelma Worm Viridis, and the Cochlea Worm to attempt to destroy the traitor. After an extended fight across the city and countryside, G manages to defeat Phylloxera Worm thanks to the encouragement of Decade and the other primary Heisei Riders appearing before him. Running off, Goro vows to save the world from Shade before returning to Eri.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8qoRIfoaH3d7OyBRMLEEuRKdLwM.jpg", "actors": ["Gor\u00f4 Inagaki (Goro / Kamen Rider G)", "Yumiko Shaku (Eri Hinata)", "Y\u00fbsuke Kamiji (Daid\u014d Oda)", "Sho Aikawa (Seizan Tokugawa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "D0M15RgjrRM"}
