They take temporary refuge in an empty building, and there she has a chance meeting with her ex-fianc\u00e9. He offers to put her up--that is, hide her--for a few days. He's now married, a professional who lives in an idyllic suburb reached by a trolley that runs through the woods. His wife seems more committed to putting up the fugitive than he is. The story involves the neighbors, the building owner who avoids involvement and seeks solace in classic poetry, and the super and his suspicious wife.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qvCkjhTZmzlBJwqgFQ8HjFodd6N.jpg", "actors": ["Beata Fudalej (Irena Lilien)", "Wojciech Malajkat (Jan Malecki)", "Magdalena Warzecha (Anna Malecka, \u017cona Jana)", "Artur Barci\u015b (Zaleski)", "Bo\u017cena Dykiel (Piotrowska)", "Andrzej Brzeski (Szef Maleckiego)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [91459, 113321], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
