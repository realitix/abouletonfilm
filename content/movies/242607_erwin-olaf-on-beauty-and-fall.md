His work has been criticized since the 1980s as being produced merely for its shock value, thus eliminating it as art. But now that important art dealers and museums all over the world are showing his works, and huge crowds are visiting his expositions, it seems as if his years of hard work will finally lead to serious recognition. Yet this is occurring, of all times, in a period of his life in which Erwin Olaf is contending with emphysema, a debilitating disease that obliges him to deal cautiously with his energy reserves. Whether his body can keep up with his work pace is uncertain.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v4dkr2tCLVBfkws6If6cA6NJHnf.jpg", "actors": ["Erwin Olaf ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
