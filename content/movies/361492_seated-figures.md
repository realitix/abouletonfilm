As Snow drives the truck over all kinds of terrain \u2014 he has offhandedly described the film as a \"history of roads\" \u2014 we see a variety of textures flowing in front of the camera as this road movie unfolds: asphalt, gravel, dirt roads, sand, grass, flowers and shallow creeks. The imagery moves between abstraction and representation as different travelling speeds affect the legibility of the visuals, and as manmade surfaces give way to the beautifully variegated patterning of nature.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bDracpekxkz7y2qBZoGolN6dhid.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
