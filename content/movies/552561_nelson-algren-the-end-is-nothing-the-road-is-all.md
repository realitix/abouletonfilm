This never before told compelling life story reveals a unique literary voice through rare interviews, archival footage and the gritty noirish voice of Algren on Algren. Kurt Vonnegut and Studs Terkel, literary giants in their own right, sing songs of praise along with many of his old friends, which makes this film seem like a hymn from the grave. This stylishly produced film embeds us in the 1950's cold war world when Algren worked. Algren's touching love affair with Simone de Beauvoir weaves it's way through the film along with the damaging impact of FBI and CIA surveillance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iceKJc2gChDzv7xAcav7GMijUs2.jpg", "actors": ["Nelson Algren ()", "Kurt Vonnegut Jr. ()", "Studs Terkel ()", "Denise DeClue ()", "Meaghan Emery ()", "David Peltz ()", "Paul Buhle ()", "Bettina Drew ()", "James R.
