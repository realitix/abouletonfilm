Also named Shoutarou, the young man is a surviving soldier of a forgotten squad that has finally returned to his homeland after ten years of isolation not knowing that the war had long ended. Parallel to this discovery, a new kind of bomb is located under Tokyo. Created by the late professor Kaneda, the Ruin Bomb has the power to destroy artificial buildings in a large area while keeping living beings (with the exception of plants) unharmed. It is up to young Shoutarou to find out what is the professor's true legacy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hcYcBLrspRnlaDerYGQaaeixAUe.jpg", "actors": ["Yuji Mikimoto (Kenji \"Kenji Murasame the Immortal\" Murasame)", "Fumihiro Awano (Shotaro)", "Minoru Inaba (Chief Ootsuka)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
