Four days later, she was banned from baseball because it considered was \"too strenuous\" for women. A lot has changed since 1931. Unfortunately, the perception of women in professional baseball isn't one of them. With THROW LIKE A GIRL, we hope to finally give Jackie the recognition she deserves and show how her legacy can continue to inspire young female ballplayers today.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
