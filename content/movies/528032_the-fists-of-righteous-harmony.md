The Police are distrustful of the ways of the Fists and vow to stop them, suspecting that they are not gud, but instead evil masked assassins, With a corrupt police force in league with the drone-like Gang of the Black Mask, and the Dark Monk bent on destroying them, can the Fists possibly survive long enough to save the world?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sDwU9YUA5AnjCtGgoAxT728mH37.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "pcJWb5ZtKb0"}
