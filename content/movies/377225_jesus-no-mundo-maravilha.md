The embarrassment of leaving led Jesus to try suicide. Today, he coordinates the work of 28 private security guards and wishes to return to the Police. Lucio got in to avenge his mother's murder and hunt outlaws. Pereira today is a protestant Christian and plays Perereco, a child's character that entertains kids at church.
