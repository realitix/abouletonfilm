The inhabitants of the city undergo the sessions on the couch. Unlocked by questions, e.g. what kind of animal is the city? they begin their journey into the depths of their own feelings and emotions. The city itself is only the starting point and over time, conversations get more and more intimate. The scenes from life, reminiscences and highly emotional moments interlace with the subjectively perceived shots of the city. They are blending together, complementing and interacting with each other. The fears of the film characters, their desires and unfinished affairs become a common fate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qiSGoWUe12MFtJFN0Au72mJyGWN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "AbFtgA2pXfo"}
