In \"The Majesty of the Law,\" a police officer must arrest a very old-fashioned, traditional fellow for assault. The man's principles have the policeman and the whole village, including the man he slugged, sympathizing with him. \"One Minute's Wait\" is about an little train station and glimpses into the lives of the passengers, with a series of comic setups. The third piece is called \"1921\" and is about a condemned Irish nationalist and his daring escape. Tyrone Power introduces each story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tmLITX8cLVPCcy3Cvtwj5AfGVQu.jpg", "actors": ["Tyrone Power (Mickey J. - the poit\u00edn maker (1st Episode))", "Denis O'Dea (The Police Sergeant)", "Cyril Cusack (The Inspector)", "Noel Purcell (The Old Man)", "Jack MacGowran (Mickey J. - the poit\u00edn maker (1st Episode))", "Tony Quinn (Andrew Rourke - Station Master (2nd Episode))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [33025, 92819, 67521, 41173], "youtube_key": "zvzIE7w8pZ8"}
