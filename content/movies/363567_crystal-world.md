{"tmdb_id": 363567, "title": "Crystal World", "original_title": "Crystal World", "slug_title": "crystal-world", "date": "2013-07-01", "genre": ["Animation / Fantastique / Myst\u00e8re"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "Crystal World is inspired by J.G Ballard\u2019s apocalyptic science fiction novel of the same name where a viral crystal metamorphoses trees, animals, humans and architecture into frozen jewels forever suspended in time and space. The novel is a haunting portrait of a world in which everything is illuminated by prismatic light, a \u2018leaking\u2019 of time that causes humans to experience individual moments endlessly looped, repeated and prolonged. My film adapts this concept of crystallization and applies it to fragments from the 1955 film. I reconstruct scenes from Charles Laughton\u2019s iconic film with underwater puppets, which I then crystallize using ammonium phosphate crystals, time-lapse photography, mirrors, prisms, and projectors.
