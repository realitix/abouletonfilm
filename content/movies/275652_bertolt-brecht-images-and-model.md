When the director Peter Voigt, former assistant director of Brecht at the Berliner Ensemble in 2004, finds a wallet with pictures and captions from the American exile, he pursued this track and discovered that Brecht has always worked with photography and film. Peter Voigt puts together an exciting collage of this film and photo material. A conversation with Erdmut Wizisla, the head of Bertolt Brecht Archives,  moderated by Harald M\u00fcller, forms the dramatic bond of the film.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Bertolt Brecht ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
