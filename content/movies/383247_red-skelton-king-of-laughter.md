Included are a rare clip of Red's famous vaudeville routine, Guzzler's Gin; a prevue for his film Public Pigeon No. 1; and footage from his Emmy Award-winning show, with guests Jack Benny and Ed Sullivan. Ed enacts such memorable characters as Cauliflower McPugg, Clem Kadiddlehopper (teaching Pedestrian Polo), Willie Lump Lump (showing how to make a salad), Deadeye, and BBC newscaster Lord Beaverhead. You'll also see rare clips from rehearsal show with Martha Raye, with uncensored ad-libs and goofs never aired on TV, and the classic blooper that occurred when an onstage cow contributed its own unique \"ad-lib.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dNxrOBvShm5d4lxYEBHpxTM6csD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
