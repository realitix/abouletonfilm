It is Marta herself who tells us her life story and how the Soviet invasion in Czechoslvakia in 1968 changed her life. Because of her deep involvement in the Prague Spring movement, she went from being the most popular singer in the country to being banned and suffering a sudden removal from the public scene by the new authorities imposed from Moscow. She refused to escape to exile and together with other banned intelectuals and artists became a disident instead. Blacklisted and persecuted by the secret police, she also suffered the betrayal of beloved people who were collaborating with the regime.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s2TDUvk3tEhvQjhWbNWyqsKaUW2.jpg", "actors": ["Marta Kubi\u0161ov\u00e1 ()", "Aneta Langerov\u00e1 ()", "Pavel Kohout ()", "Iva Jan\u017eurov\u00e1 ()", "V\u00e1clav Neck\u00e1\u0159 ()", "Helena Vondr\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
