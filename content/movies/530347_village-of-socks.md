The trade continues a centuries-old handicraft tradition rejuvenated by the conditions of global export. This is the hope of a German businessman who has turned a part of the village where cows cross muddy streets into a large manufacture. In a relaxed way, the directors capture the lives of the people in harmony with the serene beauty of the surrounding landscape to depict its change in details of everyday scenes.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
