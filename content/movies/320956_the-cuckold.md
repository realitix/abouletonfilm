While set against the backdrop of a little-known fetish in the swinging lifestyle called 'cuckolding', The Cuckold tells the broader story of two suburban couples and two urban men whose lives collide in a tale woven together by the threads of deceit, lust, and primal vengeance. It also explores the consequences and risks in looking beyond the skin in search of love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nrjB7tWHmq925R3GohmnRyiYet1.jpg", "actors": ["Tracey B.
