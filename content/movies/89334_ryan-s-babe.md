That\u2019s what Ryan discovers \u2014 the hard way \u2014 when he thought hitting the road would solve all of his problems, instead it was just the beginning. Ryan  falls into one circumstantial trouble after another. From getting car-jacked at gun-point, being mistaken for a mobster\u2019s son, to a run-in with cheerleaders intent on vigilante justice, Ryan barely escapes one mess before landing in the middle of another.
