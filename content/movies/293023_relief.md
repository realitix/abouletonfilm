Using the moving image in various states of transformation, the piece looks at the ambience of a violent event, and imagines itself as its sole artifact. Images are presented as rogue data, perhaps unreliable, with both human and mechanical origins. The process involves printing (often many generations in) and rephotographing stills from digital video, as well as manipulations with light during the photocopying process. The piece is part of a series of films that explore a hybrid of digital and analog moving images.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
