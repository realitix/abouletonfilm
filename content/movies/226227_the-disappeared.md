The film follows Horacio as he reconstructs the cause for which his real parents gave their lives, and, through this search, reclaims his true identity. This personal journey internalizes the tragedy that ravaged the country for seven years and exposes polarized views on state-driven terrorism in groundbreaking interviews with top military officials, concentration camp victims, human rights activists, journalists who covered the events, and members of Horacio's surrogate and biological families.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oGMAdGFtqnsZE6ClQxDVoahSISa.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
