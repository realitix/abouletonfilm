They're designed to help you do everyday activities with comfort and confidence. Kelly's well-planned sequencing makes them easy. First, she includes lots of between-move stretches (e.g. a \"superman,\" then a stretch, then a modified \"superman\"). Second, she maximizes results by combining complementary routines (e.g. pairing a pelvic tilt with a torso rotation to strengthen your back and loosen your hips at the same time). It's all taught in a straight-forward, \"fitness style\" manner \u2014 not dumbed down or \"medical.\" Note: the second workout is re-edited from the first.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eR6L6eIN6g6iGOqI0qwP9UVtnlU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
