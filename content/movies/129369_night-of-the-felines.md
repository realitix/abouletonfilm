Focusing on three female sex workers, the colorful, unpredictable look into the hidden underbelly of Japanese nightlife is playful but also unafraid to explore the darker sides of the business. The fleeting nature of relationships in such an environment and the consequences of toying with feelings are presented with a melancholy tinge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/13IyQjRLls66DmDbUcgKMFO1cPA.jpg", "actors": ["Tomoko Katsura (Masako)", "Ken Yoshizawa (Honda)", "Hidemi Hara (Jun)", "Keiko Maki (Omitsu)", "Hidetoshi Kageyama (Makoto)", "Akemi Yamaguchi (Masako's friend)", "Masuo Kinukasa (CEO)", "Tatsuya Hamaguchi (Aono)", "Akira Takahashi (Sakai)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
