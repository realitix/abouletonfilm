Organized through Channel 101 and a bunch of other places, we're 50 filmmakers (amateur and professional)  from Los Angeles and New York who have split the original RoboCop up into individual pieces and have remade the movie ourselves.  Not necessarily a shot-for-shot remake, but a scene-for-scene retelling. As big fans of the original RoboCop, and as filmmakers and film fans admittedly rolling our eyes at the Hollywood remake machine, we've elected to do this remake thing our own way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aqySFy4u5GR46kvRMahxCXbdxxJ.jpg", "actors": ["Chase Fein (Chasey Wong)", "Nichole Bagby (Jess Lane)", "Willy Roberts (Dick Jones)", "Randall Park (Robocop (Scene 52))", "Jae Suh Park (Lewis (Scene 52))", "G.
