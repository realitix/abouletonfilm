The title refers to the roof missing from the house where Aljafaris family resettled in 1948, a home unfinished, an incomplete construction project. The use of stillness and off-screen space creates a sense of suspension, of time spent waiting, of aftermath, of lives lived elsewhere. Aljafaris striking use of his cast, his family, reveals the influence of Bressons use of nonprofessional actors as models whose performances emanate from their presence, not from acting.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/trJu16Ye4jX8fsfG4u4GpatYCkL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
