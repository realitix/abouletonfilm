'La traviata' ('The Fallen Woman') is an opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi set to an Italian libretto by Francesco Maria Piave. It is based on 'La dame aux Cam\u00e9lias' (1852), a play adapted from the novel by Alexandre Dumas, fils. The opera was originally titled 'Violetta', after the main character. It was first performed on 6 March 1853 at the La Fenice opera house in Venice.  Piave and Verdi wanted to follow Dumas in giving the opera a contemporary setting, but the authorities at La Fenice insisted that it be set in the past, \"c. 1700\". It was not until the 1880s that the composer and librettist's original wishes were carried out and \"realistic\" productions were staged.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eKtiBPEPftZF8EcGwdivTz8mhjc.jpg", "actors": ["Svetla Vassileva (Violetta)", "Gianluca Floris (Gastone)", "Armando Gabba (Baron Douphol)", "Massimo Giordano (Alfredo Germont)", "Daniela Pini (Flora)", "Vladimir Stoyanov (Giorgio Germont)", "Roberto Tagliavini (Dottore Grenvil)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
