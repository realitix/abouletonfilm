Slightly crazy but more likely wise, the cynical homeless prophet initially rejects the good-natured dog, but eventually gives in, forming a bond sealed by her naming her one and only friend, Rascal. At a low point in her life, Sally gains renewed hope through unconditional love for Rascal.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
