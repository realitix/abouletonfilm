It\u2019s a melancholic journey to the past, a visit to mystical Villa Mehu built by a deceased ITE artist Elis Sinist\u00f6. Located deep in the woods of Veklahti, Finland, Villa Mehu served as Sinist\u00f6\u2019s home for 50 years and it was also the greatest artwork of his life although it has never got the respect that it should deserve. Today, after Sinist\u00f6\u2019s death, it is decaying slowly but surely towards its final demolition without anyone even noticing. \u201cVilla Mehu \u2013 A Lost Home\u201d takes its audience to a hypnotic journey through the bizarre yet beautiful world of Elis Sinist\u00f6. It is both a tribute to his lifework and an attempt to save a little piece of Finland\u2019s cultural history.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
