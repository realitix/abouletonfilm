This documentary takes a glimpse behind the make-up, wigs and corsets to find out what it takes to live a life in drag, why people do it and the daily battles drag queens still face, following three queens at different stages in their drag careers.  Barbara La Bush, the self-proclaimed \u2018oldest queen in Glasgow\u2019, represents traditional end-of-the-pier drag. She must come to terms with ailing health and the insecurity of a working life spent on the clubs and pubs circuit. Lawrence Chaney, part of the Instagram generation of highly looks-focused performers, seeks approval from a mainstream culture that is out of her comfort zone. And new queen Voss must battle the prejudices of a job in the merchant navy as well as gain parental acceptance.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Lawrence Chaney (Lawrence Chaney)", "Voss (Voss)", "Barbara La Bush (Barbara La Bush)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
