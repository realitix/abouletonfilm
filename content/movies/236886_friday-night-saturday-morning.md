In his latest film, Mendon\u00e7a breaks both with the horror genre and his criticism of the consumerist behaviour of the middle classes in Brazil. Friday Night Saturday Morning is a small-scale romantic love story, shot with a digital camera in black &amp; white and in a documentary style. We follow the conversation between two lovers, each on a different side of the world; he is in Recife, she is in Kiev. On one side is dark, on the other light, but both experience the same emotions and hence feel nearness and contact.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nPldR2x1nrckC2ZRD8HPr4zTjpc.jpg", "actors": ["Pedro Sotero (Pedro)", "Bohdana Smyrnova (Dasha)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
