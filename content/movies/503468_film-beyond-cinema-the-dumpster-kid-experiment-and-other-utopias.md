One example of his tireless search and research are the Geschichten vom K\u00fcbelkind, which he co-directed with Ula St\u00f6ckl in 1969/70, 22 absurdly funny, subversive and anarchistic short films of different lengths, which consciously oppose all conventions, with incredible success. The films remain unrivalled in their Dadaistic inventiveness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2lHfUBx1rBxSKjOAvg8oPMsiiKE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
