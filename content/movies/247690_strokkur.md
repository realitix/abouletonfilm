Collect images and sounds instead of producing them.  The camera, the microphone and the mini-amplifier: tools that take away and then give back. We defined a rule: the sound shouldn't  illustrate the image and the image shouldn't absorb the sound.  Less than a hundred kilometres from Reykjavik we found Strokkur.  For three days we saw and heard the internal dynamics of the crevice: the boiling water that spat out every seven minutes and the thermal shock, given the eighteen degrees below zero of the atmosphere.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xm7SRPvDw6EQZfky8CwbdoqoymK.jpg", "actors": ["Norberto Lobo ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
