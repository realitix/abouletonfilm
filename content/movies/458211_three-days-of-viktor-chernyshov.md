Victor works in a Moscow factory. Not driven to ambition, he spends most of his free time hanging around with other young people on the streets. Constantly warned by his concerned mother to make something of his life, she becomes even more worried when he gets in trouble with the law. Although it does contain worker slogans and themes, there is not much to classify this feature as a propaganda film. This marks the directorial debut for Mark Ossepijan. ~ Dan Pavlides, All Movie Guide", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aszR7BiZhrV2ALhmacCyq8U8pdD.jpg", "actors": ["Gennadi Korolkov (\u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0448\u0435\u0432)", "Arina Aleynikova (\u041d\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0438 \u0421\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430)", "Lev Prygunov (\u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d)", "Valentina Telichkina (\u041c\u0438\u043b\u0430)", "Gennady Sayfulin (\u041a\u043e\u043b\u044f)", "Vasiliy Shukshin (\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e)", "Semyon Sokolovsky (\u041e\u0442\u0435\u0446 \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0430)", "Aleksei Chernov (\u0414\u044f\u0434\u044f \u041f\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b)", "Natalya Rychagova (\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0448\u043a\u0430 (\u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0442\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
