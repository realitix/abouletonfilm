Ready to embrace his traveling experience, he misses his train and finds himself in a small village region. Viewed by the villagers as 'an eccentric in a white Stetson', he finds himself settling into an unfamiliar world of very strange people. Here the people really do drown newly-born puppies, eat the fish they catch in the river and even smack their children. But it only takes a few days before Joe begins to understand the villagers and, after accepting them into his heart, he falls in love with Liza, a beautiful local girl.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1y517IK2ddGRPxpnNBe1hXm7V0H.jpg", "actors": ["Maria Mashkova (Liza)", "Anton Pampushniy (Joe Sokoloff)", "Niele Serezhnikova (Olya)", "Alexander Danilchenko (Grandy Grisha)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
