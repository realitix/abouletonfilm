At a Soviet plant the German team works in cooperation with Russian specialists. Once Hans makes a mistake which causes the explosion of the furnace and human losses. Hans finds himself at the mercy of Pyotr, the only witness to his actions near the furnace. Pyotr also depends on Hans, because Pyotr\u2019s very presence near the furnace entails accusation of subversive actions and a death sentence. Mutual suspicion gives way to silent sympathy and later friendship. They even look like each other, both have small children. Pyotr secretly leaves the town with his family but Hans feels loss rather that relief at the disappearance of the embarrassing witness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r5UJPiZyCspdM84Q8rm1jSyfsZ0.jpg", "actors": ["Jakob Diehl (Hans)", "Birgit Minichmayr (Greta)", "Mark Waschke (Otto)", "Marc Hosemann (Will)", "Anna Skidanova ()", "Roza Khairullina (Nina)", "Sebastyan Anton (Tomas)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
