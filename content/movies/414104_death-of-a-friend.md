The two heroes (played by Gianni Garko and Spiros Focas) are pimps, like the protagonist of Pasolini's own ACCATTONE. The relationship between Aldo and Bruno and the bourgeois society which rejects them is a complex one. The pimps are both callous and caring; their prostitutes are by turn vindictive and generous.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/IZThvRVqfXlif1k0O2IvKBPlQt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
