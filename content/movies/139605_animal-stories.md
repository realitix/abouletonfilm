These stories are conveyed as humorous rhyming couplets. Simple, fresh and lots of fun, Animal Stories takes a humorous look at the lives, loves and concerns of the animal kingdom, viewed from a child's perspective. Each episode of this colorful series, centers on a different animal and asks a question about an aspect of life that all children can relate to...  What is life like for a Penguin who can't fly, a Pig who thinks he's too fat or a Frog who discovers his wife is expecting thousands of children!?  What do you do if you're a Dog that's got bad breath?
