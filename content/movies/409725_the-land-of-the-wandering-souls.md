Rithy Panh shows us the work done in Cambodia to connect Khmer-society to \"modern world\". Farmers, soldiers and children work for a living there and unearthen skulls and bones -their remains from PolPot-regime you can see. The fear in their mind is portrayed by Rithy Panh in this documentary. As the other work done by Rithy Panh this deals with his people. I like it very much! The movie was awarded 1999 at \"Visions du R\u00e9el\" in Nyon (Switzerland) and at \"Cin\u00e9ma du R\u00e9el\" in Paris.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hzkY7U2WXZKSMeeSqEsLhfhmbui.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
