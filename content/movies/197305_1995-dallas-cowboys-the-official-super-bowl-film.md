Of the three championship seasons, this was the most interesting. NFL Films does a masterful job examining the highs and lows of a 12-4 season, with much of the story told in the words of players other than the big three.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8DgsrJ2lZ17aY386MOuKqzZEcqt.jpg", "actors": ["Barry Switzer (Himself)", "Troy Aikman (Himself)", "Emmitt Smith (Himself)", "Michael Irvin (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
