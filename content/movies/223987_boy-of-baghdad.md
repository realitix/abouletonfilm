Doe-eyed and adorable Kheer Allah lives with his mother, father, two brothers and sister. Their \"home\" has no furniture and no modern appliances, except for an old television and radio sitting precariously atop a stack of used tires. There's no meat on this family's table. Home-baked pita bread is the staple in this beyond-poor household. School is out of the question too. Young Kheer Allah must work every day to help his family survive. This daily struggle forms the heart of this remarkable film. Through the wind-swept and war-ravaged streets of his neighborhood, Kheer Allah parlays his abundant charm into a variety of odd jobs that bring little money, but much satisfaction to his ever-smiling face.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fDJEkBdPEK9ULtd78QMJ2TPRA8W.jpg", "actors": ["Kheer Allah (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "l_0yGXoLNNQ"}
