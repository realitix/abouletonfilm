Part two and three take place in the desert of the Southwestern United States and Mexico, where I went in quest of, and found, the natural habitat of the peyote cactus. I watched this sacred plant cut and dried for the Indians of the Native American Church. I consumed peyote on numerous occasions. In later years when I red Castineda\u2019s books on the teachings on Don Juan I realized that Mescalito was not a figment of Don Juan\u2019s imagination, and that there is a spirit world whether we like it or not. Part four is a document of the time, and exemplifies the poetry that was in me at that time.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g4WdkD71CQB0EWUO2lIA3J9LcVv.jpg", "actors": ["Wallace Berman ()", "Phillip Lamantia ()", "Michael McClure ()", "John Reed ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
