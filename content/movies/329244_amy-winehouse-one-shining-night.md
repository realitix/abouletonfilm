Witness that evening's searing performance, featuring songs from the album, Back To Black, including \"Rehab\" and \"You Know I'm No Good.\" Then hear, in her own words, how the influences of Mahalia Jackson, Thelonious Monk, and even Salt-N-Pepa helped her forge her own jazz pop style.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Amy Winehouse ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
