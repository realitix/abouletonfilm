P.C.L. worked in collaboration with a brewer\u2019s firm, Dai Nihon Biru, who met the production costs of the film in full, and whose products are featured in the film in an example of the sophisticated and modern merchandising typical of the studio\u2019s early work. The film is partially set in a beer hall, and its story concerns a beer seller at a train station and her relationship with a music student trying to create a hit song. Director Sotoji Kimura was to become a company stalwart, making such films as Ino and Mon, while actress Sachiko Chiba would emerge the studio\u2019s first real star, appearing in such films as Wife Be Like a Rose.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4K1dCvHJZZpaLSVXpa4c0bRNx1T.jpg", "actors": ["Musei Tokugawa ()", "Dekao Yokoo ()", "Heihachir\u00f4 \u00d4kawa ()", "Hisao Yoshitani ()", "Kamatari Fujiwara ()", "Tokio Seki (Asao's father)", "Ry\u00fbtar\u00f4 Nakane ()", "Sadao Maruyama ()", "Roppa Furukawa ()", "Shir\u00f4 \u00d4tsuji ()", "Sachiko Chiba ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
