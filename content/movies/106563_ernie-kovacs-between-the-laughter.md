Ernie Kovacs was one of the giants of early television. I think he would be pleased with the way Jeff Goldbloom captures his wonky personality. Melody Anderson also distills that of Edie Adams. There is a very basic heart tugging story about the search for Kovacs' two abducted daughters. But at the same time the film is funny --- Cloris Leachman is a hoot as Kovacs impossible mom --- and has many of the offbeat and innovative qualities of the old Kovacs show itself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xgmEMVB3a32l9wIwdxHYzPT7Weh.jpg", "actors": ["Jeff Goldblum (Ernie Kovacs)", "Melody Anderson (Edie Adams)", "Madolyn Smith Osborne (Dorothy Kovacs)", "John Glover (Pierre Lafitte)", "Cloris Leachman (Mary Kovacs)", "Joseph Mascolo (Richards)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
