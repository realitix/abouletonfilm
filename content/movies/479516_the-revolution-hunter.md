She, the Revolution Hunter, tries to enter in that picture as if she could enter into a time she didn't belong and finally understand what it means to be part of a revolution or what it means to fight for a country.  A film that explores the relationship between two generations, two different times and two different fights. As if we could transform a photograph by drawing on it. As if we could transform the present by drawing over the past.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wkQNUPkme35htev1qTFVUuJ5e3t.jpg", "actors": ["Margarida R\u00eago (Voice)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
