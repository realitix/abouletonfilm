He wrestles with his conscience over this, while Swee'pea packs a bundle and runs away from home. They apparently live in the wilderness, since Swee'pea crosses a rope bridge that collapses, narrowly misses a landslide, and is soon on a narrow mountain path. Popeye finds him and rescues him from a waterfall but his spinach can is empty. Fortunately, this was all a bad dream from Popeye's conscience.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5GdiqgtaJlK9zkCzt1rjlIekJK3.jpg", "actors": ["Margie Hines (Olive Oyl)", "Jack Mercer (Popeye)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
