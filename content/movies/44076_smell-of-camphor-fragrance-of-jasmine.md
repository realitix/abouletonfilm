He's working on a documentary, for Japanese TV, on Iranian burial practices. On the anniversary of his wife's death, a hitchhiker tells him a story of spousal abuse and infant mortality, he discovers that someone has been buried in his plot next to his wife, and he needs the help of his attorney, a well-connected fixer. He dreams of death, even as he investigates it for his film. His niece's husband, a well-known writer, fails to return home; he searches hospitals for an unclaimed body. His heart disease is flaring up. Is he prepared for death? Is that all that's left?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q2Oruub4itcHD71CBDqmrRppUDK.jpg", "actors": ["Bahman Farmanara (Bahman Farjami)", "Parivash Nazarieh (Farzaneh)", "Reza Kianian (Dr. Arasteh (The Attorney))", "Roya Nonahali (Woman Hitch-Hiker)", "Mohammad Khatami (Himself)", "Hossein Kazbian (Abdollah (The Servant))", "Mahtaj Nojoomi (Bahman's Sister)", "Valiyollah Shirandami (Homayouni - The Actor)", "Firouz Behjat-Mohamadi (Memorial Sign Rental)", "Ebrahim Abadi ()", "Dariush Asadzade ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
