A series of small events disrupts their delicately balanced ecosystem. Jessika's father loses his job and becomes bored and despondent, while Jessika's mother reenters the workforce and becomes empowered. These events act as catalysts for the slow, painful disintegration of the family, with each member committing shocking acts of alienation and self-destruction. Desperately wanting her family but at the same time desiring her adolescent independence, Jessika struggles to find the best way to restore a balance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ntJXwAaoxpDiRZT1X4oh72wi6YX.jpg", "actors": ["Elisa Schlott (Jessika Borowski)", "Petra Kleinert (Tine Borowski)", "Michael Lott (Ernst Borowski)", "Sina Tkotsch (Caro Borowski)", "Annekathrin B\u00fcrger (Oma Annemarie)", "Benjamin Trinks (Basti)", "Maximilian Befort (Tim)", "Christine Rollar (Erzieherin)", "Frederic Welter (Jens)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
