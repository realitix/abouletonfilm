A unique experiment shows us how complex the social strategies in the community of this fascinating anthropoid ape are. Haanstra managed to capture almost all aspects of chimpanzee behaviour: display of skill, teasing and pestering, grooming, resting, playing, motherly behaviour, submission, sex and violence. Eventually, the film was also screened to the apes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wpNaH0TxEdA9TuUGahXvQHBsb51.jpg", "actors": ["Bert Haanstra ((voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
