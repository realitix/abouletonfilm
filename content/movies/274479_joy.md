Russell tries to use their preferred cast in yet another story about a dysfunctional family which drags down the main character and how this character, in opposition to her own family and any other coming difficulty, overcomes everything and leads to success.\r\n\r\nWe have already watched similar stories in \"The Fighter\" and \"Silver Linings Playbook\" and, although weirdly, in those movies it worked, but not in this one any more.\r\n\r\nSpecially, the ending seems abruptly rushed and truncated and the \"Citizen Kane\" moment is quite childish and obvious."}, {"pseudo": "Reno", "content": "> A small accident can lead to a great achievement, but difficult path is certain.\r\n\r\nIt is a semi-biographical film about a person who invented a modern hygienic mop. So all the depicted events and characters were partially real, but for the cinematic reason they have been fairly altered for a good outcome. And yes, I loved it. A very inspiring film among all the Oscars nominees this year. In some way I also felt Jennifer Lawrence should have got the award for her fine character display.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I was not interested in this, so I wanted to get over it silently as soon as possible. But I ended up enjoying a lot and instantly it became one of my favourites of the 2015. What I expected after watching its trailer was like I judged it by its cover. As I hesitated in the earlier, but strangely now I'm recommending it to all.\r\n\r\nThe story of a woman who grew up listening her grandmother's motivational speeches. But realises the life is tougher than she thought and making a living is very competitive. After so many struggles in the life, she finally invents something that changes her and her family fortune forever. But like any new initiative does face, the problems arise and how she is going to fix them is what the remaining film narrates.\r\n\r\nA very interesting film in the perspective of the career option. Forget the doctors, engineers, lawyers and those who're settled in their lives with a good job in hand that pays big, but there are billions of people, to them it will definitely serve as an inspiration to ignite their future.\r\n\r\nThe rating for this looks like a fair value, but still a very underrated film everywhere. Amazing actors, a little funny and a little emotional, but a very impressive film directed by the one who bought the Oscars to Jennifer Lawrence for their earlier venture together. I don't know what's between her and Bradley Cooper, but looks like their onscreen chemistry is doing something big impact. This is their's fourth project together and second with the director, so I hope they do more in the future as well. This is really a wonderful film, so don't miss it.\r\n\r\n8.5/10"}], "recommandations_id": [167073, 295964, 314365, 321697], "youtube_key": "SN4MLMHET7w"}
