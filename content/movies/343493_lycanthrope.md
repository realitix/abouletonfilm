Government agent Bill Parker heads a commando team sent to investigate the silenced outpost. Tension is palpable as the jungle heat grips the group when Parker discovers that the psychiatrist, Dr. Stein, has brought along his sexy wife, Sheila, who was once Parker's lover. There's no denying Sheila is a beautiful woman with the loyalty of a piranha. Horror upstages sexual tension, however, when the group is confronted by an empty laboratory drenched in human blood. And a body torn to shreds. They soon discover that they, too, are being hunted.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kTnWdsGfFUNsQdvjiza8ugeluM5.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Carradine (Bill Parker)", "Michael Winslow (Lee Davis)", "Rebecca Holden (Sheila Stein)", "Christopher Mitchum (Jake Sutter)", "Jeffery Alan Chase (Ivan Stein)", "Dalia Garcia (Rosary)", "Bruce Gregory (Cody)", "Bob Cook (Dr. Baker)", "Darcy Donavan (Sally)", "Benny Andersson (Kevin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
