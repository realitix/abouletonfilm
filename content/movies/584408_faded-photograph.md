From family films shot by her paternal grandfather and her father between 1954 and 1998, and the diaries he wrote during his life, the director tells the story of an ordinary man whose personal memory echoes a collective memory : one of a generation bursting out of Quebec's great darkness in which freedom is also synonym of disorientation. Thus begins a dialogue marked by nostalgia, between joyful videos and tormented writings, which soon becomes universal.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aJJbaJe2L5jFy49fP5Gb3cIVQVy.jpg", "actors": ["Patrick Labb\u00e9 ()", "Salom\u00e9 Dion-Corbeil ()", "Fanie Pelletier ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
