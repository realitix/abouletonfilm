Finnish musician Artsi  heads to Berlin in hopes of hitting the big time; needing a place to stay, he takes a room at the Downhill City Hotel and ties to find a market for his music. Meanwhile, another Downhill Hotel resident, aspiring author Fabien, meets a former convict named Sascha who has nowhere to stay and offers to take him in. Peggy, who works at a fast-food restaurant, is unhappy with her boyfriend Hans and finally kicks him out. Peggy meets Artsi when he stops by the burger stand one day, while Hans (who ends up crashing with Sascha and Fabien) starts a new relationship of his own with Doris.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c7otUolY1kNCC775Gi44b83WKRE.jpg", "actors": ["Franka Potente (Peggy)", "Teemu Aromaa (Artsi Sompanen)", "Andreas Brucker (Hans)", "Michaela Rosen (Doris)", "Sebastian Rudolph (Sascha)", "Janne Hyyti\u00e4inen (S\u00e4l\u00e4)", "Hans Martin Stier (Peter)", "Maria K\u00f6rber (Esther)", "Manja G\u00f6ring (Ulrike)", "Tobias Schenke (Punker)", "Dieter Dost (Abteilungsleiter)", "R\u00fcdiger Sander (Hermann)", "Dagmar Biener (Frau am Band)", "J\u00fcrgen Schmidt (Filialleiter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
