Ever since, he reviews knives and other products, unboxes limited fan editions of mainly gangsta rap albums, gives talks about himself, drinks, swears and bawls in town, humiliates others, cracks borderline jokes and crosses every boundary he sees - Max is a YouTube creator and makes a decent living off of it. Most of Max's friends have their own channels on YouTube, some even quite successfully. Max and his gang are dubious role models but without a doubt, they are celebrities of their generation having more than 300.000 active fans. Is Max a violence-glorifying influencer with far-right tendencies or a usual adolescent, just trying to find himself and happens to be born into a time where the lines between private life and public self-display are blurring? He might be both, possibly without being overly aware of it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mT3uk2tHX2CRyrXeBwmpu41bcMx.jpg", "actors": ["Max Herzberg (Himself)", "Frederik Seibt (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "FR6qbfHHBvs"}
