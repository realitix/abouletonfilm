It takes place during the dog days of summer, in the 13th year, when the cicadas are everywhere. A meditation on the line between isolation and solitude. Nature is both comfort and decay. Motherhood as both presence and erasure.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2bP9VOLcxBAKkM4BpcwLVBED47S.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
