When they hear on the radio that the police are looking for them, they dump the car and hide out near a farmhouse. But the farmer's radio also broadcasts the couple's description, so they run away and start hitchhiking, only to be picked up by two policemen. They manage to flee into a railroad yard and hop a train that turns out to be refrigerated. Finally they decide to turn themselves in -- just as they learn that the real crooks have been apprehended.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/78VGB0ftXbPug41oZhOIAVexkWw.jpg", "actors": ["Buster Keaton (Elmer)", "Dorothea Kent (Elmer's Girl)", "Broderick O'Farrell (Mr. Reynolds)", "Si Jenks (Farmer)", "Fern Emmett (Farmer's Wife)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
