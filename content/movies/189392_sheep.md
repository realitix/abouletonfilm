Their beloved daughter, who has recently been left by her husband and is now alone with a newborn baby, is visiting. The family needs a quiet day together, but when their friends, Janne and husband Steen, show up a day early for a planned Midsummer Night's dinner, things start to snowball out of control - in particular for Bitten the perfectionist and for Mogens who is racked by guilt; Mogens has had an affair with Janne, who does not accept his decision to end it. As the evening progresses, Janne pushes them all into a psychological game, in which not only Mogens' marriage is at stake but also his relationship to his daughter Kira.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t9zJqBEjoTCVq32Y1ELvtLZsMFV.jpg", "actors": ["Vibeke Hastrup (Bitten)", "Susanne Heinrich (Janne)", "Sophie Jacobsen (Baby)", "Kitt Maiken Mortensen (Kira)", "Peter Schr\u00f8der (Steen)", "S\u00f8ren S\u00e6tter-Lassen (Mogens)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
