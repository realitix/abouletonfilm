{"tmdb_id": 196905, "title": "Love $ Greed", "original_title": "Love $ Greed", "slug_title": "love-greed", "date": "1991-05-26", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "In this offbeat relationship comedy, Robert (Frank Bruynbroek) and Alexandra (Melissa White) are a couple who were once married, but things didn't work out and in time they chose to separate; Robert is now married to Suzie (Lori Eastside) and Alexandra has wed Ted (Dick Monday). But a very large spanner is thrown into the works when Robert learns his late, eccentric, and very wealthy Uncle Leopold has willed them 23 million dollars. There is, of course, a catch -- before Robert and Alexandra can get the money, they have to conceive and give birth to a healthy child within a year. Given that there will be enough money to go around for everyone, Robert and Alexandra decide to give it a try, which doesn't ease any of the tensions in their old relationships -- or make things run any smoother in their new relationships. Love and Greed (aka Love $ Greed) also features David Charles and Ivan Roth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4b6l432omsGlugfajkuUwcmKOY8.jpg", "actors": ["Frank Bruynbroek ()", "David Charles ()", "David Cohen ()", "Mickey Cottrell ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
