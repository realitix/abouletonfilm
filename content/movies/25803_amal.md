With only one month to discover and claim the inheritance, Amal's struggles with duty and wealth are threatened by all those around him - from a young injured beggar girl and a lovely store merchant, to the danger of the old man's upper-caste friends and siblings, all seeking to claim their share of the riches.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/93lnXustnEtAKnwKMmppsij52wO.jpg", "actors": ["Rupinder Nagra (Amal Kumar)", "Seema Biswas (Advocate Sapna Agarwal)", "Naseeruddin Shah (G.K.
