Rather than mount a traditional tour to promote a book's publication, Atwood conceived and executed something far more ambitious and revelatory--a theatrical version of her novel. Along the way she reinvented what a book tour could (and maybe should) be. But Atwood wasn't selling books as much as advocating an idea: how humanity must respond to the consequences of an environmentally compromised planet before her work of speculative fiction transforms into prophesy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pfOSyVJeOkD6ftkFdxKUL9pqaJF.jpg", "actors": ["Margaret Atwood (Margaret Atwood)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
