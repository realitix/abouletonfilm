Chronicling a young sailor's descent into a murky, treacherous underworld of pimps and thieves, after having encountered a Louise Brooks lookalike at a fairground and missed his departing boat, it's a lively moral fable that delights in vivid visual effects and quirky characterisations. If the plot occasionally reveals gaping holes, and the tacked-on ending urging the clearance of the Leningrad slums seems to be rather gratuitous, there's enough going on to keep one attentive and amused.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2uJoqSpzJzLexi3rjhWt4xErGAU.jpg", "actors": ["Lyudmila Semyonova (Valya)", "Pyotr Sobolevsky (Vanya Shorin)", "Antonio Tserep (Tavern Owner)", "Emil Gal (Vaudeville Performer)", "Sergei Gerasimov (Man The Question)", "Andrei Kostrichkin (Drummer)", "Yanina Zheymo ()", "N.
