Montero has intentions of robbing the bank owned by skinflint Lucius Perkins, but is sidetracked by the attractions of singing-teacher Helen Wardell. He learns that Perkins has marital designs on Helen and holds the mortgage on her ranch. But Helen is in love with Bill Howard. Perkins offers Montero money to kill his rival, but Montero fakes the murder. Prepared for a double-cross of his own double-cross, Montero takes the sheriff's posse prisoners, collects the offered blood-money from Perkins, and then forces Perkins, as the local justice-of-the-peace to perform a wedding ceremony for Helen and Howard.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2ss9jmFtz7Bi8ZrB5wftxDkE3tu.jpg", "actors": ["Rod La Rocque (Montero)", "Doris Kenyon (Helen Wardell)", "Mitchell Lewis (Colosso)", "Tom Keene (Bill Howard (as George Duryea))", "Walter Long (Bobcat)", "Charles Middleton (Lucius J.
