Much was written about this notorious crime but little understood about the hidden, yet legal, tissue transplant industry that spawned it...until now. With exclusive access inside maximum-security prison to the man the NYPD labeled \"Public Enemy No.1\" this film charts how a former surgeon went from saving lives to ripping them apart.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fI0iKyWHZv5lTVc3EUzLTKYq0HM.jpg", "actors": ["William Sherman (Journalist)", "Michael Mastromarino ()", "Lee Cruceta ()", "Anthony Dumaine ()", "Dayna Ryan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
