He here presents the man in the street as a film protagonist whose reality lies somewhere between a dream and a nightmare. In these three aesthetic reinterpretations, Provost, using seemingly insignificant raw material, not only moulds mystical spaces that compellingly absorb the viewer, but also masterfully shows that the dream-world called 'cinema' is simply a constructed parallel reality comprising clich\u00e9s, technical rules and dramaturgical conventions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aAsPM5wL9rFF3A5alGz3ZjykUZm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
