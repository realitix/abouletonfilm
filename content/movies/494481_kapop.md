The 'plot' involves the 'ghost' of a girl who was saved from a rape by a witch/ghost who then inhabits her body and wreaks vengeance on a series of unsuspecting guys by murdering them during sex (chomping off their privates!). A group of students makes a field-trip to the village where this mysterious carnage is occurring and gets sucked into the 'horror' and sex!"}], "recommandations_id": []}
