In a period of three years they shot over 40 hours of New York Dolls footage. Now for the first time ever this footage is unveiled. This feature length documentary captures the band during early performances in New York at Kenny\u2019s Castaways and Max\u2019s Kansas City, then follows the Dolls on their tour of the West Coast, including footage from the Whisky A Go Go, the Real Don Steele Show, Rodney Bingenheimer\u2019s E Club and much more. Intercut with revealing interviews, backstage banter and late night debauchery, this is THE definitive document of the New York Dolls.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gadUxgNCDVhDyN9kwGSRMFEKfkT.jpg", "actors": ["David Johansen (Himself)", "Sylvain Sylvain (Himself)", "Johnny Thunders (Himself)", "Arthur Kane (Himself)", "Jerry Nolan (Himself)", "Bob Gruen (Himself)", "Nadya Beck (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "DDsE73NCMgQ"}
