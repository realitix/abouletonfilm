The film is narrated both by the woman (a text written by Nooshin Farhid), and by a second anonymous voice at the beginning of the film, perhaps that of the film-maker who follows the woman in red, stalking her. The camera takes the role of a voyeur but rather than being in control, it is as fragile and vulnerable as the events it records. In the film a \u2018 real\u2019 passerby asks what the woman in red is doing. He expresses concern at being filmed and yet solicits the attention of the camera. He volunteers the information that he suffers from mental illness. His real life concerns merge with those of the woman in red.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
