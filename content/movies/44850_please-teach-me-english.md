But then a game of chance designates her as the member of her office staff who will take English courses\u2014much to her horror. In the same class, she encounters show salesman Park Moon-su, who fancies himself a dashing ladies\u2019 man. He\u2019s studying English in part to communicate with his long-lost American sister, but mostly for the purpose of wielding exotic pick-up lines, and is soon deploying them at the less-than-impressed Cathy, the pretty Australian teaching the class. But while Park flirts with Cathy, it\u2019s Young-ju who finds herself mooning after the handsome if self-absorbed fellow.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ug553bPyI2e3olxua93GkOoPHsu.jpg", "actors": ["Lee Na-young (Na Young-ju)", "Jang Hyuk (Park Moon-su)", "Angela Kelly (Catherine)", "Jeong Seok-yong (Tyson)", "Na Moon-hee (Moon-su's mother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [52032, 74641, 41401, 132165], "youtube_key": "KDke6Uw_DZE"}
