The premise involves the bottom slut getting snagged for stealing, and being sent to the titular school. Yeah, it's been done before in countless other flicks, but director Cross uses not only a terrific cast, but some wildly inventive, funny, and unquestionably hot motives and tactics to get his cast - and the viewer - insane with a hard-on.The flick's best scene by far has cover model Kyle getting a medical exam from doctor Jack Phillips (since when do doctors slobber over and sniff boots?) that includes gut and pec punching, nipple and ball twisting and an wicked ass pummeling. (That's one HMO I'd join in a heartbeat.) There's more, including a quite amusing food fight that turns into a group scene, and Mack and David first kissing Kyle with a broom handle, and then fucking the living crap out of him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x29ORSm95jpM0HFXkt1riRo0j0M.jpg", "actors": ["Kyle McKenna ()", "Brent Cross ()", "Tommy Hart ()", "Kristian Brooks ()", "Jack Simmons ()", "Sam Dixon ()", "Joey Verducci ((as Mack Reynolds))", "John Ross ()", "Christopher Zale ()", "Ethan Marc ()", "David York ()", "Peter Wilder ()", "Brian Daniels ()", "Jeremy Lee ()", "Jackson Phillips ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
