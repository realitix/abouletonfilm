In a real town. In something approximating civilization. But first, he'll have to evade his keen-eared companion, the elf Nara (Alyssa Kay), who is driven to achieve her destiny at any costs.  Meanwhile, the Pale Lady (Paige Barnett) weaves a web of doom around our heroes in pursuit of her plans for the undead priest Carrow (Brain Lewis), Rilk (Jesse Lee Keeter) and his orcs pursue the psychotic orcslayer Glorion (Kevin Pitman), and two competing bards (Fran Kranz and Emilie Rommel Shimkus) battle for ownership of the world's most important epic.
