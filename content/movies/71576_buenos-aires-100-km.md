A place that dreams of the nation's capital. Stephen, Mat\u00edas, Alejo, Dami\u00e1n and Guido were born 13 years ago in this small town. Have always been friends and together they share the monotonous summer afternoons sitting on the stoop of a women's hairdresser. Anxious, restless, impatient for a change, go through the most confusing period of experiment. The transition from childhood to adolescence. Appears curious about women and sexual awakening, accompanied by the rebellion against their parents and family mandates.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lBnNDiuQxjvg6XsFvJTuEYLLxIF.jpg", "actors": ["Juan Ignacio Perez Roca (Esteban)", "Emiliano Fern\u00e1ndez (Alejo)", "Alan Ardel (Guido)", "Hernan Wainstein (Matias)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [149349, 48596, 94225, 73473], "youtube_key": "NLKGRnCla30"}
