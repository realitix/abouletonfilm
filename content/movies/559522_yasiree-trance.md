Between them, rocks the river. And tales about the origin of the Earth. Sailing between different stories about the island and the plant, Yasir\u00e9e Trance invites us to create a new mutant cosmogony. Together with Malena, the film declares itself as transgender, and questions different possible narratives seeking its own mythology.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
