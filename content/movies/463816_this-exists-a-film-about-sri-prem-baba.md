This story is delightfully told by himself leading us through the odyssey that would turn an ordinary boy into Prem Baba. Memories of friends, admirers and followers take us along the paths of the prosperous therapist who sank into a deep existential crisis and finally found India, where he would devote himself, after much debate, to his master and his destiny. A rich journey of enlightenment that brings us precious reflections on the meaning of life and the role of each one on this planet.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pZJEEICXPkzN32XGiLZbinFVZaW.jpg", "actors": ["Sri Prem Baba (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
