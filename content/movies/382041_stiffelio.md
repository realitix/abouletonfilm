'Stiffelio' is an opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi, from an Italian libretto by Francesco Maria Piave. The origin of this was the novel \u201cLe pasteur d\u2019hommes\u201d, by \u00c9mile Souvestre, which was published in 1838. This was adapted into the French play 'Le pasteur, ou L'\u00e9vangile et le foyer' by \u00c9mile Souvestre and Eug\u00e8ne Bourgeois. That was in turn translated into Italian by Gaetano Vestri as 'Stifellius'; this formed the basis of Piave's libretto.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nEpVEOhaGEikqOKYeClqhhvyrZq.jpg", "actors": ["Roberto Aronica (Stiffelio)", "Yu Guanqun (Lina)", "Roberto Frontali (Stankar)", "Gabriele Magnione (Raffaele)", "George Andguladze (Jorg)", "Lorelay Sol\u00eds (Dorotea)", "Cosimo Vassallo (Federic di Frengel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
