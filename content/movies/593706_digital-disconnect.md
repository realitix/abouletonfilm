Tracing the internet's history as a publicly funded government project in the 1960s to its full-scale commercialization today, the film traces how the revolutionary, democratizing potential of the internet has been radically compromised by the growing and unaccountable power of a handful of telecom and tech monopolies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/czYskaNvgEaIlDjtVM8QjxXPeS.jpg", "actors": ["Robert McChesney (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
