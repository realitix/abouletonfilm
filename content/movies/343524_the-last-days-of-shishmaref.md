The effects of global warming threaten the very existence of these people- so much that the entire population needs to be relocated off the island within 10 years. They have become the first tangible victims of the worldwide climate changes. The project exists of several components; exhibition, book, film, website, and educational program. In the documentary Jan Louter depicts the impending end of the traditional lifestyle on the island of Shishmaref trough the lives of three Inupiat families. Despite the alarming situation, the film has not become a political manifesto. The Last Days of Shishmaref is a moving film about identity, transience, mortality, and the clash between different eras and cultures.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eBytTQSMZngh6QKF3dSkL5rMA9i.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
