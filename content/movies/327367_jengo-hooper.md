A demonic force latches onto him and takes over his mind slowly, making the good part of him rot away. Almost like a possession by a demon. Only this demon called itself Jengo Hooper.  Expect some seriously mentally disturbing scenes, car chases, hot women, explosions, decapitated body parts and cannibalism.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jVbvUH0k7CT02bduEtBCRc2tpx3.jpg", "actors": ["Joe Wheeler (Jengo Hooper)", "Share Cherrie (Shelly)", "Jessica Velle (Lela)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [81478, 172372, 143146], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
