Few movies reach this level of crossover failure like Star Wars Holiday Special.  It's a hodge-podge of rehashed Three Stooges, clips of older episodes, and Snoopy Come Home.  I believe they were trying to see if Scooby would ever work without monsters, mystery and for the most part, the rest of the gang.  The only audience I can think of that might enjoy this is perhaps a 3-year old who likes the dog but finds regular Doo too scary.  Even still, they would get none of the supposed 'jokes' referring to old campy tv shows."}], "recommandations_id": [109167, 12903, 13351, 13355]}
