The Nazis, having a straightforward program, occupy Hungary with little or no difficulty, as the Hungarian political leadership had no unambiguous program for responding to possible steps of the Nazis. In spite of the secretly signed cease-fire agreement and proclamation, Horty gives up all plans of resistance at the news of the kidnapping of his son. The Nazis take over power and roll up the so-called conspiracy aimed at Hungary's breaking away from the German alliance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/42a39JRqsUannlFS12oWPzXGnhK.jpg", "actors": ["Ferenc B\u00e1cs ()", "K\u00e1roly M\u00e9cs ()", "Marianna Mo\u00f3r ()", "Tibor T\u00e1nczos ()", "\u0150ze Lajos ()", "Klaus Maria Brandauer ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
