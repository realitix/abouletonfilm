The mixed media featured include puppetry, CGI, hand-drawn animation, illustration, acrylics, claymation, and even 'animated' tattoos, just to name a few. This mass-collaboration approach is less about remaking Romero's film and more about viewing the classic through an experimental lens. Instead of trying to alter Image Ten's work, NOTLD:R seeks to showcase the responses that artists from around the world have had to this landmark film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kJLzL7Dtn1JV1TlDTSwYOBUdYKq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
