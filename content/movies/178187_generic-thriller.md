Or maybe not...as Steven, a handsome young theater history professor discovers when he sets out to write a stage thriller - a plain, old generic thriller - only to discover that his characters prefer a character study - and want it to be a movie, not a play. At least Steven can create the man of his dreams, right? But that character - Vertigo - named after Steven's sixth grade teacher Mr. Vertigo (Steven always dates men named Vertigo) - isn't really cooperating. Will Steven ever finish his play? Will Vertigo behave (or rather, misbehave) as Steven wishes? And what about the friends on whom Steven is basing his other characters - will they still be his friends when it's all over?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Zv9P3C0vD01azyEtEJOBThVxRq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "5xfL5E7Z7as"}
