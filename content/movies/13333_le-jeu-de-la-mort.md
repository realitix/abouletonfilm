After constantly rejecting their advances they try to kill him and fail. Lo fakes his own death and goes underground to get back at the criminal gang.\r\n\r\nBruce Lee only half finished a version of this film before he died in 1973. Five years later director Robert Clouse who made Enter the Dragon with Lee completed the film.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this, he used the existing footage with Lee, also used stock footage from previous Lee films and got a double and shot new footage with a new story line.\r\n\r\nThe result is a choppily edited film despite getting Hollywood actors such as Dean Jagger and Gig Young as well as John Barry to do the musical score. In fact Jagger gets some awful dialogue.\r\n\r\nThe new footage with the double is leaden and so are the action scenes. Only the Bruce Lee shot sequences bring the film to live."}], "recommandations_id": [12481, 11713, 9462, 9461]}
