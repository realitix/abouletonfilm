The wall looks to be about 20 feet above sea level and extend at least 100 feet into the water. A large wave rolls picturesquely along the wall toward the shore. Smaller waves follow. Then the scene changes to river water flowing. We see both shores: in the foreground a log and tree branch are visible; on the far shore, there appears to be a low wall with trees beyond it. The camera is stationary in both shots.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9kuqHJGO5r6s2iEiH0IglyExJWC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [178994, 119984, 179546, 196628], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
