A dazed crowd has gathered to gawk at the destruction. As disorienting as the situation is, the source of tension quickly shifts from the mysterious culprit to the camera operator: Who is she, what is she doing here, and whose side is she on? The startling answer is gradually revealed and unpacked in this shrewdly designed film, which quickly sheds its suspense thrills to become a provocative consideration of, among other subjects, what it means to be a woman camera operator in a war zone. Without a single cut, Flight of a Bullet captures both the harrowing and the disturbingly mundane nature of war.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
