An Athens hotel, full of refugees and expatriates of all nationalities, is captured by Allied troops in the closing days of the War. British Major David Niven has been ordered to prevent a cache of weapons hidden in the hotel from falling into the hands of renegade troops. He cannot allow himself to trust anyone--not even the most innocent-looking (or attractive) of guests. Originally titled La Citta Prigioniera. Conquered City was released in English-speaking countries outside the U.S. as Captive City.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/arAp1uprUL0ahqINYs6j7FIWw3W.jpg", "actors": ["David Niven (Major Peter Whitfield)", "Lea Massari (Lelia Mendores)", "Ben Gazzara (Captain George Stubbs)", "Daniela Rocca (Doushka)", "Martin Balsam (Joseph Feinberg)", "Michael Craig (Captain Robert Elliott)", "Clelia Matania (Climedes)", "Giulio Bosetti (Narriman)", "Percy Herbert (Sgt.
