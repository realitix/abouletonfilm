Set and filmed during the sixties, this fiction feature tells the story of a young Montrealer who edits an underground newspaper with help from his female friend and a draft dodger from the United States. Two rival philosophies of dissenting youth become evident in the choices they make: militant protest vs. communal retreat. The film includes some seminal archival footage of a speech by legendary anti-war activist Abbie Hoffman and bloody rioting during the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ypQ1iE2gy1fuEn1vGek9wUUVUSM.jpg", "actors": ["John Robbe (Jesse)", "Elaine Malus (Karen)", "Gary Rader (David)", "Christopher Cordeaux (Neil)", "Peter Cullen (Allen)", "Henry Gamer (Karen's Father)", "Victor Knight (Judge)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
