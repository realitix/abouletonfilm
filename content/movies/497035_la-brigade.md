After the war, some of them continue to have a \"resistance\" mind-set. One of the stories concerns a love relationship between a Polish boy and a French girl who are thrown together because of their war efforts. After the war, they get together and reminisce.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/38tqVec11JQkJmkcEhfUw4RCrY0.jpg", "actors": ["Brigitte Fossey ()", "Edward Wojtaszek ()", "Jean Bouise ()", "Marcel Cuvelier ()", "Piotr Szymanowski ()", "Andrzej Siedlecki ()", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Vanura ()", "Jacques Zanetti ()", "Andr\u00e9 Thorent ()", "Jacques Dumur ()", "Bogus\u0142aw Stokowski ()", "Francesco Curto ()", "Catherine Riand ()", "Jean Valmont ()", "Gilette Barbier ()", "Michel Delahaye ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
