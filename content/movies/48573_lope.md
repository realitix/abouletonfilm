It doesn't work.\r\n\r\nSecond, the main character is performed by an Argentinian actor that doesn't speak a standard Spanish from Spain, in contrast with the rest of the cast. That makes the most important part of the film not credible.\r\n\r\nMaybe this second mistake is not so important for the international audience but, for the Spanish one, which I assume is the main target, makes the film a disaster."}], "recommandations_id": [43420]}
