More and more, the trappings of street life have landed popular rap artists behind bars - and not just for a music video shoot. What happens when a rapper who has everything suddenly has his freedom stripped away and is forced to deal with the harsh realities of prison? \"Rhyme and Punishment\" takes an in-depth look at the role of prison in hip hop culture, and reveals the side of the story that is not being covered by the news and popular media. The true and personal stories of hip hop artists who are, have been, or are soon to be incarcerated, in their own words. Featuring intimate and compelling interviews with convicted rappers Beanie Sigel, Prodigy, Cassidy, Project Pat, Immortal Technique, Slick Rick and many more.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zroRLocl0xjarE1MQ0dsIOIGZnL.jpg", "actors": ["KRS-One (Himself)", "Beanie Sigel (Himself)", "Prodigy (Himself)", "Immortal Technique (Himself)", "Slick Rick (Himself)", "Project Pat (Himself)", "J-Diggs (Himself)", "RBX (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "3as_ccxxhMQ"}
