As he launches into his personal study of the complex human condition, the irregularities and uncertainties of misguided love, and his earnest attempts at farming, he is hilarious, insightful and deeply self-deprecating. Drew has been a regular guest on the syndicated Bob and Tom Radio Show and All-Star Theatre Tour, and he has years of stand up experience in clubs all across the country. His seasoned comedic talent pays off big in his first long awaited comedy special! Articulate yet acerbic, Drew Hastings is a raconteur with plenty of stories to tell. Irked &amp; Miffed will leave you anything but.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ne8oNUbgTLEm0Q10H71z3XS22NS.jpg", "actors": ["Drew Hastings (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
