It tells the story of this historical period (war, revolution, take-over by the proletariat, dictatorship) from the view of an extremely wealthy lady, Andr\u00e1ssy Katinka. The authors tried to evoke the special story during which a strange and unique woman gets thoroughly involved in history through her love and at the same time keeps her own identity and self-governance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qlBfYL2iljjnS5VNURXXIsg5ROd.jpg", "actors": ["Juli B\u00e1sti ()", "Ferenc B\u00e1cs ()", "K\u00e1llai Ferenc ()", "Temessy H\u00e9di ()", "Edit Frajt ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
