Residents of Sunset Hall are retired radicals; they have retired from work but not from protesting against injustice. Bitter Lucille considers herself a realist. Wheelchair-bound Irja is sunny and optimistic. Lucille was raised a Jew but always aspired to assimilate. Irja wants to explore all sorts of new traditions. Through the lives of these women, Sunset Story shows the life at Sunset Hall: teachers, a dancer, an engineer, a social worker, and others, all living out their golden years in a unique environment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8om7zOzKqdnX9mV2rhL0Ijo5s3u.jpg", "actors": ["Lucille Alpert (Herself)", "Irja Lloyd (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
