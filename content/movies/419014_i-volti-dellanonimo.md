I fed the images through what was probably his own movie camera that I had purchased in Rome in 1972. The frames appeared vertically and horizontally, individually and in short sequences and so I allowed them to become superimposed [by rephotographing them in several passes] and dissolves were created naturally by the shutter of the old movie camera due to the speed of manual rephotography, by improvised slowing down or stopping of the camera. To summarize, a movie camera reshoots a movie camera and its viscera through its own gate, creating the animation of an unknown experimental artist.\" Paolo Gioli", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jQleBhgLsOQRDzo6c17fK44CsRY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
