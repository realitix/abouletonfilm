The Jewel will sail more than five thousand kilometres across the Indian Ocean and do battle with the Monsoon \u2013 but for sailors it can spell danger and even death.  It took a year to build: the Jewel of Muscat \u2013 a reconstruction of a 1200 year old Arab ship, based on an ancient shipwreck. Built from more than 18 tonnes of wood, the ship is held together entirely by 100 km of rope in over 127,000 hand-sewn stitches. Now the Jewel will sail more than five thousand kilometres across the Indian Ocean and do battle with the Monsoon \u2013 the mighty rain soaked wind that turns the arid land it touches green. But for sailors it can spell danger and even death.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kq0TwQG6m3LTBDq7sTIIGmPdT3X.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
