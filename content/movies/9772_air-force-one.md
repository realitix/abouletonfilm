Some people on Rotten Tomatoes and other sites have been moaning that it was too much American patriotism. Well, that\u2019s a load of bullshit! Sure it was very American but given the name and the cast, what the hell did these morons expect? If one cannot enjoy a good American action movie because of some patriotism in it, well then do not watch them! Incidentally there are some countries in Europe, no names mentioned cough cough, that could do with some more patriotism in the first place. Anyway, for us it was two enjoyable hours and hey, it's Harrison Ford after all! It is a decent enough transfer to Blu-ray although the choice of sound codecs is a bit unusual in that it has a Linear PCM 5.1 English track on it."}], "recommandations_id": [9869, 5503, 9331, 3595], "youtube_key": "jPYnVOIfNiU"}
