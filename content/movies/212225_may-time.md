In Infanta, Quezon, locals turn each of the 31 days of May into a charming honor not only to celebrate good harvest in their agricultural setting, but also to pay tribute to the virginal virtues of the Mayohan.  Every month of May, a padasal or series of novenas commences to mark the beginning of Mayohan.  This will culminate in a Pasayaw or Tapusan in every purok of each barangay.  A system of ambagan or donation ensues for the festivities to take place.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wCLdRpIVeWgUMvGujpatVF4Ymon.jpg", "actors": ["Lovi Poe (Lilibeth)", "Elijah Castillo (Nino)", "Ping Medina (Ruben)", "Lui Manansala (Chayong)", "Chiqui del Carmen (Ising)", "Dianne Laserna (Martha)", "Jill Palencia (Melay)", "Girose Lano (Aida)", "Benedict Jhocson (Mayor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
