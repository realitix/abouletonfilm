Desperate, but keenly aware of the answer's potential effect on the public, the programmer strikes a deal with his interrogators, agreeing to re-design the software in exchange for his freedom. As they search to understand why the program answered an ethical question and try to find a way to change its response, the faith and patience of both the programmer and his captors are put to the test. Suspenseful and darkly comic, S.E.R.P. is a film about coercion, innovation, and whether it is possible to do something good in the service of something evil.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/W38kySzx3J4M2TMXwOfR7eoGzJ.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Balunis (Murdock)", "Robert Sean Campbell (Webster (as Robert Sean Campbell))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
