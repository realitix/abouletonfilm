When this year's frosty morning finally arrives, the pair eagerly sets out to find what is sure to be a wonderful addition to their stable. But when his father picks the meanest, wildest mare John has ever seen, the boy is baffled. Of all the horses his father could have selected, why choose such an imperfect one?
