This film is a desperate and loving attempt to\r keep memory of the people, knowledge and objects that coexist in this space, that risks\r closing at any time. Lab workers participated in the shoot as animators, actors and technical\r advisors.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vWh4HxfOJIOmu1dDtfOOZlOOHVU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
