He drives a semi, plays the guitar and raps. Sandman looks like Woody Guthrie but sings like LL Cool J. Roll Out, Cowboy follows the 39-year-old country/hip-hop musician as he tours the American West, performing for rural towns who might not have heard hip-hop before. We witness bank break-ups and town groupies: even a brief flirtation with truck-driving. Sandman's story is the struggle of an artist trying to make a buck. In a tough economy, can your American dream still carry a tune?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
