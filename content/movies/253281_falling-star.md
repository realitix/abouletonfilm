This intriguing episode is transformed into a plea for beauty, creativity and joy. The film functions as a metaphor for contemporary Spain and its ongoing state of crisis.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/srRlvuFlNg0N6G2BbiZu79EkyrZ.jpg", "actors": ["\u00c0lex Brendem\u00fchl (Amadeo of Savoy)", "Lola Due\u00f1as ()", "Lorenzo Balducci ()", "B\u00e1rbara Lennie ()", "Francesc Garrido ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [110956], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
