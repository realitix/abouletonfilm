He accomplishes this easily enough by arranging for a prostitute to visit his home while his parents are off on a trip. But the life lesson he learns is different from what he'd intended when he learns of his parents' death in an airplane crash. When he moves into his grandparent's home, changes schools and falls in love for the first time, he is no longer able to keep intact his earlier snobberies and childish self-importance. This Spanish-language film is set in the later period of Francisco Franco's rule ('60s and '70s) and features excellent performances by its young cast.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zjMVePO445svZBehGBSd2k3E3tL.jpg", "actors": ["Fernando Ramallo (Trist\u00e1n)", "Luc\u00eda Jim\u00e9nez (Luc\u00eda)", "Isabel Otero (Isabelle)", "Joel Joan (Claudio)", "Jordi Bosch (Padre)", "Alma Rosa Castellanos (Marilyn Arena)", "Orestes Gas (Anton)", "Eloi Yebra (F\u00e9lix)", "Alicia Hermida (Flora)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
