Apparently, unwitting parents (including a particularly proud gay couple) have hired the semi-retarded redneck nanny under the pretense that he takes good care of his toddler charges. Instead, Plop beats and humiliates the children, taking his own sad mental issues out on them. However, the cops are hot on his trail. It won\u2019t be long before the long arm of the law, or a mangled baby with a can of soup, ends Plop\u2019s cruel crime spree once and for all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fAp0UgI3rC3Zc56CLlU97mJPNho.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
