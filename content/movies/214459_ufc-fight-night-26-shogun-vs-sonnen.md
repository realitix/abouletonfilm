The main event is expected to be contested between former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion, Maur\u00edcio Rua and Chael Sonnen. The bout was first linked to UFC 161, as Sonnen was briefly mentioned as a short notice replacement for Rua's original opponent Ant\u00f4nio Rog\u00e9rio Nogueira, who had bowed out of the bout with a back injury. Sonnen's status as a felon created travel issues to get into Canada, resulting in Rua being pulled from the event altogether.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gwnR8VG3S9tb23Xs54cFbAHrz62.jpg", "actors": ["Maur\u00edcio Rua (himself)", "Chael Sonnen (himself)", "Travis Browne (himself)", "Urijah Faber (himself)", "Yuri Alcantara (himself)", "Matt Brown (himself)", "Mike Pyle (himself)", "Uriah Hall (himself)", "John Howard (himself)", "Joe Lauzon (himself)", "Michael Johnson (himself)", "Brad Pickett (himself)", "Michael McDonald (himself)", "Conor McGregor (himself)", "Max Holloway (himself)", "Mike Brown (himself)", "Steven Siler (himself)", "Diego Brandao (himself)", "Daniel Pineda (himself)", "Manvel Gamburyan (himself)", "Cole Miller (himself)", "Cody Donovan (himself)", "Ovince Saint Preux (himself)", "Ramsey Nijem (himself)", "James Vick (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
