Albert uses this to his advantage and becomes the Director of the Montan Corporation, and a member of the West German Parliament. Herr Karjanke, the real Captain, learns of Albert\u2019s ruse, and wants to claim his \"rightful\" position in Parliament. But Karjanke cannot come forward until his politicking \"Doppelganger\" succeeds in passing an amnesty law for war criminals. When Albert is finally brought before a judge on charges of fraud, he learns that this own amnesty law does not apply to him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aNENIn87jZLinVat0wbhfKH3tN4.jpg", "actors": ["Rolf Ludwig (Albert Hauptmann)", "Erwin Geschonneck (Hans Karjanke)", "Christel Bodenstein (Hannelore Ullrich)", "Manfred Borges (Max Steinmetz)", "Johannes Arpe (Dr. Seekatz, B\u00fcrgermeister)", "Hubert Suschka (Rundfunkreporter)", "Harry Riebauer (Oberleutnant Kilian)", "Trude Brentina (Klatschbase)", "Wolf von Beneckendorff (Rhetoriklehrer)", "Else Wolz (Adele Karjanke)", "Kurt Steingraf (Pferdapfel, Baron v.
