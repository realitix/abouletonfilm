Seven matches aired on the broadcast.  In the main event, three championships were on the line: Diesel's WWF Championship, Shawn Michaels' WWF Intercontinental Championship, and Yokozuna and Owen Hart's WWF Tag Team Championship. If Diesel had been pinned, he would have lost the WWF Championship and if Michaels had been pinned he would have lost the Intercontinental Championship. The British Bulldog replaced Hart in the match, as Hart with his wife at the hospital, as she was giving birth to their second child.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6dp6eFFLCj9a7akKKbixVakVZPw.jpg", "actors": ["Sidney Raymond Eudy (Sycho Sid)", "Davey Boy Smith (The British Bulldog)", "Scott Charles Bigelow (Bam Bam Bigelow)", "Troy Martin (Dean Douglas)", "Scott Hall (Razor Ramon)", "Bret Hart (Himself)", "Carl Joseph Yvon Ouellet (Jean-Pierre Lafitte)", "Kevin Nash (Diesel)", "Rodney Anoai (Yokozuna)", "Michael Shawn Hickenbottom (Shawn Michaels)", "Juan Rivera (Savio Vega)", "Daniel Eugene Spivey (Himself)", "Mark Canterbury (Henry Godwinn)", "Harry Fujiwara (Mr. Fuji)", "Robert Louis Backlund (Himself)", "Ted DiBiase (The Million Dollar Man)", "Paul Michael L\u00e9vesque (Hunter Hearst Helmsley)", "Solofa Fatu Jr. (Fatu)", "Dustin Runnels (Goldust)", "Robert Howard (Bob Holly)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "qi2Kg7wbfa0"}
