He infuriates the other woodland creatures - when he isn't baffling them with his bizarre behavior. Woody overhears a squirrel and a group of birds gossiping about him. Even though he just sang a song proclaiming his craziness, he denies their whispered accusations that he's nuts. But after they trick him into knocking his head on a statue, the poor bird hears voices in his head and decides the animals might be right. He decides to see a doctor. But leave it to Woody to choose Dr. Horace N. Buggy, a Scottish-brogue-burring fox, who is, if it's impossible, even madder than he is.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gt4iGYZXE7sJyrkqbzTgReb0lPx.jpg", "actors": ["Mel Blanc (Woody Woodpecker / Dr. Horace N.
