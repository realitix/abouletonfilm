The province of Roman Palestine is a bubbling cauldron of rebellion and control. And on this greater canvas Luke, narrates a story of wonder, amazement and impact... The world is anticipating this moment in history but no one can imagine God touching His creation in the form of a little baby named Jesus. Much is recorded in the Gospels about Jesus' miraculous birth, to a young virgin named Mary, in Bethlehem, but little is known about his quiet growing up in Nazareth. Joseph, his adopted father, seems to have died well before Jesus turns 30 and begins his ministry.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6sNpSoxEtRlmYI5QoC7ZTSRVTZe.jpg", "actors": ["Zohir Al Nobani (Zadok the priest)", "Mohammad Bakri (Herod / Devil)", "Abeer Issa (Elizabeth)", "Yussuf Abu-Warda (Luke / Narrator)", "Ashraf Barhom (Judas Iscariot)", "Shredi Jabarin (Jesus)", "Nadera Emran (Samaritan Woman)", "Ghassen Mashini (Pilate)", "Baker al Qabbani (Simon the Priest)", "Abdelkarim Qawasmi (Zacharia, John Father)", "Nisreen Faour (Herodias)", "Loutof Nousser (Caiaphas)", "Hanan Hillo (Mary Mother of Jesus)", "Adnan Tarboush (Peter)", "Nariman al Qurneh (Mary Magdalene)", "Mohammad Al Ibrahimi (Thief On The Cross #1)", "Ayman Nahas (John The Baptist)", "Milad Matar (Nicodemus)", "Mahmmod Soboh (Teacher Of The Law)", "Osama Masri (Simon The Pharisee)", "Nabeel Ahmad Alkoni (Joseph Of Arimathea)", "Ehab Salami (Annas)", "Jameel Khoury (Joseph, Father of Jesus)", "Henry Andrawes (Demoniac)", "Radi Shadi (Rabbi At John Circumces)", "Mustafa Abu Hanood (Blindfold Guard)", "Elias Abboud (John)", "Elias Isaak (Andrew)", "Ehab Hammam (James)", "Nasrin Stille (Widow From Nain)", "Maisa Abd Elhadi (Salome)", "Kamal Zaid (Roman Soldier)", "George Eskandar (Pilate's Wife Messenger)", "Kamal Awad (Roman soldier)", "Ibrahim Shehaden (Paralytic)", "Muhannad Hariri (Shepherd Beit Lahem)", "Sultan Bitro (Shepherd Beit Lahem)", "Mohannad Aljabi (Shepherd (Musician))", "Abd Alkader Abbad (Shepherd (Musician))", "Fadi Al Sabayegh (Levite)", "Mohammad Jizawee (Rich Man)", "Moataz Allabadi (Malchus)", "Hidar Kuffof (Centurion)", "Veselin Mezekliev (Servent)", "Georgi Krastev (Rabbi At Jesus Circumcision)", "Nikolai Kostov (Jesus the Baby)", "Bastien Combes (Jesus the Kid)", "Andon Raychev (Janus)", "Toni Karabashev (Canaan)", "Filip Gulyashki (Phillip)", "Daniel Peev (Bartholomew)", "Stefan Shterev (Matthew)", "Stefan Spasov (Thomas)", "Stefan Roglev (James the Son of Alpheus)", "Tsvetomir Angelov - Tsuki (Simon the Zilot)", "Ilia Atanasov (Judas the son James)", "Denis Atanasov (A Young Man Resurrected)", "Rada Velinova (Joanna)", "Maria Sotirova (Slave Girl)", "Leart Dokle (Slave Man at Torturing Area)", "Stoyan Pepelanov (Malchus' Cousin)", "Vladislav Vetrov (Barabbas)", "Miroslav Andonov (Roman Legion Soldier #1)", "Georgi Panayotov (Man at Gate)", "Stoyan Cvetkov (Simon of Cyrene)", "Biser Marinov (Thief on The Cross #2)", "Liudmila Dimcheva (Mary the Woman, Mother of Jacob's)", "Isaac Elias (Disciple (as Ishaq Elias))", "Diana Encheva (Woman in the crowd)", "Nikolay Kolev (Nikolay Kolev)", "Lutuf Nouasser (Caiaphas)", "Stoyan Tsvetkov (Simon of Cyrene)", "Kalin Yavorov (Greek)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
