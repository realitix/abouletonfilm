Would personally recommend you give it a go._"}, {"pseudo": "Wuchak", "content": "***Simple, cute and sweet***  \r\n\r\nChristopher Robin (Ewan McGregor) is in his 40s, married with a daughter, and working the joyless grind in London when his pal Winnie-the-Pooh unexpectedly shows up. He takes the stuffed animal back to his childhood haunts in Hundred Acre Wood to find Pooh\u2019s other stuffed animal friends. Hayley Atwell and Bronte Carmichael play Christopher\u2019s wife and daughter.\r\n\r\nReleased in 2018, \"Christopher Robin\" is a decent live-action rendering of A.A. Milne\u2019s popular characters with the twist that Christopher is an adult rediscovering his childhood friends and the simple joys thereof. The theme of escaping the work grind and getting your inspiration back recalls \u201cJoe Versus the Volcano\u201d (1990), \u201cCity Slickers\u201d (1991) and probably a gazillion other flicks. The stuffed animal critters are ultra-cute, the story is simple and the English cinematography is exquisite. I would\u2019ve preferred a more gripping story, but I think the creators kept it simple on purpose.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes and was shot entirely in England (London, Berkshire, Kent & East Sussex).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"}], "recommandations_id": [404368, 260513, 363088, 400650]}
