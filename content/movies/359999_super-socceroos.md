It was the night a nation came to a standstill...\r the night football in Australia came of age.  The night a proud sporting nation\\'s 32-year World Cup drought\r came to an end.  The star-studded Qantas Socceroos boasting international stars\r Harry Kewell, Mark Viduka, Marco Bresciano, Tim Cahill and\r Mark Schwarzer took on two-time World Cup winners and their\r 2001 nemesis Uruguay.  More than 80,000 fans at the Telstra Stadium in Sydney made this\r the hottest ticket in 2005. More than three million viewers made\r SBS the only channel to watch history in the making.  Fresh from a close-fought loss in Montevideo, the Socceroos would\r draw level before embarking on the most gut-wrenching penalty\r shootout Australian fans had witnessed.  This was a match for the ages and an event of national significance\r unrivalled in this country... and now this collector\\'s item will\r be a permanent record of one of Australia\\'s truly great sporting\r moments.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
