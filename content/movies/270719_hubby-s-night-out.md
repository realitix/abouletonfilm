She gets a burglar scare and insists on his staying home. However, he wants to go to a masked ball, so he gives her a powder, telling her it will make her sleep soundly. She slips the powder into his favorite decanter, hides his costume, and then retires. In the kitchen, the cook gives a policeman some of the doped whiskey. Neal takes the cop's coat, hat, and stick and starts for the ball. On the way he is called on to restrain a wife-beating husband. He gets a black eye, so decides to go home.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Betty Compson ()", "Neal Burns ()", "Eddie Barry ()", "Harry Ham ()", "Stella Adams ()", "Joe Janecke ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
