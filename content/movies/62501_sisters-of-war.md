It is a story about the Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, especially Sister Berenice Twohill and her working friendship with nursing sister, Lorna Whyte. The Australians pulled out of the mission in Vunapope outside Rabaul, leaving the nurses and wounded who took refuge there. They were captured and about to be executed when Bishop Leo Scharmach MSC bluffed the Japanese by saying that he was the representative of Hitler and his people could not be executed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ccAXP8UPrlvlP3liqKueSivtZBc.jpg", "actors": ["Claire van der Boom (Sister Berenice Twohill)", "Sarah Snook (Lorna Whyte)", "Susie Porter (Kay Parker)", "Gerald Lepkowski (Bishop Leo Scharmach)", "Anna Volska (Sister Cordula)", "Khan Chittenden (Len)", "Kuni Hashimoto (Japanese Captain)", "Kentaro Hara (Sugal)", "Helen Christinson (Cal)", "Helen Cassidy (Tootie)", "Catherine Miller (Sister Martha)", "Paulini Curuenavuli (Sister Marie)", "Ken Makio (Suzuki)", "Paul Bishop (Geoff Lempriere)", "Kathryn Marquet (Grace)", "Emma Randall (Joyce)", "Amy Humphreys (Olive)", "Yutaka Izumihara (Japanese Lieutenant)", "Marcus Guinane (Les)", "Nick Wright (Jim)", "Mitch Kennedy (Ron)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [50334], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
