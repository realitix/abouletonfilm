As the film progresses the darkness is interrupted by light or a light. A random sequence of lights ensues - theatre lights, streetlights, household lights, the lit end of a cigarette. The camera greets these interruptions in the darkness with alarm, reticence, perplexity, curiosity. The accompanying voice emits a series of grunts, moans, sighs, laughs. Nothing happens.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p9MsKzIwEqsIzbgoJPf6X57Gpey.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
