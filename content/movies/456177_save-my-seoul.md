Things get complicated when they meet Crystal and Esther, two prostitutes who reveal just how deep the problem goes and set off on a dangerous mission to capture the truth. With the use of hidden cameras and access to pimps, johns, and sex-workers, the filmmakers explore and unravel the complexity of the sex trade in Seoul. They learn that this problem is rooted in issues far deeper than exploited girls and lustful men. Instead, it's a consequence of a culture and government that condones and turns a blind eye to the biggest human injustice of our time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p5WiYSpl5zcqWBpiGPkgn78pGyL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
