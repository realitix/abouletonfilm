Actually, he's not really himself, but a federal agent, dispatched to Texas to buy horses on behalf of the government. Hale runs up against a vicious gang of horse thieves, including such veteran western hard cases as Roy Barcroft and Philip van Zandt. The romantic interest is in the dainty hands of Adrian Booth, who used to go by the name of Lorna Gray. Put together with the standard Republic efficiency, The Last Frontier Uprising benefits from the breathless direction of Lesley Selander.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pUPcYXuS7SlIKxWn9ZWDmu592r7.jpg", "actors": ["Monte Hale (Monte Hale)", "Lorna Gray (Mary Lou Gardner (as Adrian Booth))", "Malcolm 'Bud' McTaggart (Vance Daley (as James Taggart))", "Roy Barcroft (Henchman Boyd Blackwell)", "Tom London (Skillet (Ranch Hand))", "Philip Van Zandt (Liberal Lyons)", "Edmund Cobb (Sheriff Hanlon)", "John Ince (Sam Chisholm)", "Frank O'Connor (Rancher Frank)", "Robert Blair (Texan (as Bob Blair))", "Doye O'Dell  (Rancher)", "Foy Willing (Singing Ranch Hand)", "Riders of the Purple Sage (Singing Ranch Hands)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
