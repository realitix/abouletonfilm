He is sweeping the street when he anticipates a cop who is about to throw some litter into the road and dashes over to catch it in his cart. He then tries to save a drunken man from falling into the road before stopping his cart to pick up a solitary leaf which has dared to fallen upon the ground. The eccentric and obsessed street sweeper meticulously disposes of the leaf but when he turns around he finds half the tree has shed its leaves at that very moment", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["'Snub' Pollard (The Caretaker of the Estate)", "Marie Mosquini ()", "Noah Young (The Director)", "George Rowe (The Cameraman)", "Mark Jones ()", "Tiny Ward ()", "Wallace Howe ()", "William Gillespie ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
