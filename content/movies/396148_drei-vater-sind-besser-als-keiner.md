To fulfill his wish, Mother Maike first has to find out who that is. Three teenage acquaintances come into question: a farmer, a car screwdriver and the village's former heartthrob. With the eleven-year-old and his little sister Luise in the luggage, the lone parent drives to her hometown F\u00fcdrum, where she once turned her back as a pregnant woman.
