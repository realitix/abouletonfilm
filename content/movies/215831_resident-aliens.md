Thursday, November 24, Thanksgiving Day. Alex, a local newspaper photographer, gets into a \u201cgreen card marriage\u201d with her good friend James, a Guam-born Filipino.  Miriam, a former member of the Philippine press and now an established Guam journalist, longs to repair a damaged relationship with her American husband.
