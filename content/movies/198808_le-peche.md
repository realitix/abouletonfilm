Azziza (Faten Hamama) is brutally raped by a guard (Zaki Rostom) when she goes into the fields to gather potatoes for her husband (Abdallah Gheiss). She does not relate the incident to her husband who is suffering from an undisclosed illness. Azziza hides the pregnancy and strangles the baby after it is born, but she also dies soon thereafter. The migrant workers rally around her memory as she becomes a martyr to the cause of the struggling peasants.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fxOSrCsEPg0wS8mY4DBCGtmQqnp.jpg", "actors": ["Faten Hamama (Aziza)", "Abdallah Gheith (Abdullah)", "Zaki Rostom ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
