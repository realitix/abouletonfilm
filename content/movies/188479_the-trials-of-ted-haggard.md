Ted Haggard had it all: prosperity, a doting wife, five kids- and a ministry that reached out to approx 30 million followers who counted on his every word, whether on TV or in person at one of his arena sermons. In 2006, it all fell apart when Pastor Ted admitted to having sex with a male prostitute and to buying methamphetamines. He was exiled from his church and home in Colorado and became a pariah who now makes ends meet as a traveling insurance salesman.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/62161i8crzxj1Yrh2w8GUF34tJM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
