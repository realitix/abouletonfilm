She was the supermodel who became Andy Warhol\u2019s most notorious muse and the singer of legendary American rock band Velvet Underground. She had a troublesome love story with Jim Morrison and gave her son his first shot. She was a nomad, always on her way to Paris, London, or New York and stood in the center of the sixties\u2019 art revolution.  In \"Nico \u2013 Sphinx of Ice\", we are taken on a journey through the psyche of the broken and unbreakable sixties\u2019 icon.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/59IWpDgAcnJoGmXFyycMoZATJUE.jpg", "actors": ["Fanny Risberg (Nico)", "Gr\u00f6nberg Nils (The child)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
