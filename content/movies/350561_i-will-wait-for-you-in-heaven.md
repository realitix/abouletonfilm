The film is a Philippine adaptation of Emily Bronte's classic novel, Wuthering Heights. Instead of the moors in Bronte's novel, the setting is transposed to the tropical beaches and ocean cliffs. The ill-fated lovers are passionately played by Richard Gomez and Dawn Zulueta, who, at the time of the movie's release, were also involved in a real-life relationship.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A0sfKMoBFrZfD1eZmXnqzIZZHwG.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Gomez  (Gabriel)", "Dawn Zulueta (Carmina)", "Michael De Mesa (Milo)", "Jackie Lou Blanco (Sandra)", "Eric Quizon (Alan)", "Vangie Labalan (Adora)", "Joe Mari Avellana (Don Joaquin)", "Guila Alvarez (Young Carmina)", "Gio Alvarez (Young Milo)", "Jomari Yllana (Young Gabriel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "wxRYQXW-sjw"}
