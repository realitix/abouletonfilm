To get out of it, Ferdie fakes an ankle injury. When his wife spies him walking without his crutch, she writes a letter to her stern mother, inviting her to stay with them while Ferdie heals. Rather than face his mother-in-law, Ferdie admits he was faking his injury, and tears up the letter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gXWTajJtS0abvXOb8ZNFCerL9dM.jpg", "actors": ["Sidney Drew (Ferdie Crosby)", "Mrs. Sidney Drew (Ferdie's Wife - Eva)", "Ethel Lee (Ferdie's Mother-in-Law - Mrs. U.
