For a long time, they have been looking for a voice for their new cartoon feature, \"Paddy the Pig,\" and the cop is just perfect. The policeman is tickled pink at the prospect of being a star and begins telling all his friends about his good fortune (he has no idea what they plan to do with his voice). Eventually he ends up marrying one of the producers, who still hasn't told him the truth. Suddenly the night of the big premiere finally arrives and all of the policeman's old friends and colleagues are there. As it begins, the policeman is appalled and humiliated to see that he has been mocked and has become a laughing stock. He immediately spurns his new wife and goes back to the police force. Time passes, and fortunately, the two reunite and settle their differences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pEY1s0f4YS8zRA1YCCnqypY43qj.jpg", "actors": ["Phil Regan (Jimmy Duffy)", "Jean Parker (Linda Fay)", "Jerome Cowan (Bob Adams)", "Dorothea Kent (Mabel Dunne)", "Benny Baker (Sidney)", "Barnett Parker (Bekins, the Butler)", "Horace McMahon (Joe Nash)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
