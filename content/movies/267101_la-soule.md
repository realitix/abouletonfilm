It was not uncommon for players to be left on the playing field after a game, dead or maimed. In this unusual drama, Pierre Cursey (Christophe Malavoy), a former officer in Napolean's army, seeks revenge against Francois Lemercier (Richard Bohringer), one of his soldiers, who betrayed him to the English. His plan is to track the soldier (now a village cobbler) down and humiliate him completely in a game of Soule, preferably one which results in grave injuries. It seems that the soldier's whole sense of pride in himself is invested in participation in this game. Pierre has one difficulty, though, as the nefarious soldier is not only a very good Soule player, but is the captain of a championship-winning Soule team.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cYBGSLrZTDBS85k7lWq6DXnq9iW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
