Shocking and challenging, these were works in which Jesus didn't die, took revenge on his enemies and kissed Mary Magdalene on the mouth - a Jesus unrecognisable from that found in the traditional books of the New Testament.  Through these lost Gospels, Pete reconstructs the intense intellectual and political struggles for orthodoxy that was fought in the early centuries of Christianity, a battle involving different Christian sects, each convinced that their gospels were true and sacred.  Owen Jones sets out the context in which heretical texts like the Gospel of Mary emerged. He also strikes a cautionary note - if these lost gospels had been allowed to flourish, Christianity may well have faced an uncertain future, or perhaps not survived at all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tznKUA83Z13MT6WT3kqxCnHf3Wf.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Owen-Jones (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
