She is pretty and intelligent, but unable to cope with complicated relationships in which she became involved, while the professor is a person whose lectures on mass media are most visited by students at the Faculty. However, his views are not met with approval by the bureaucratic circles at the University. Vice Dean of the Faculty by means of intrigue manages to lure Una into a game with the professor. Thus, an innocent interview turns into a record of life, philosophical and ideological views of the controversial professor, and then into a malicious report about his life, behaviour, action and movement ... The Film is based on the novel Una written by Momo Kapor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eTlDw1RrDS6jqDfdAsCKduQ9FjK.jpg", "actors": ["Sonja Savi\u0107 (Una)", "Rade Serbedzija (Profesor Misel Babic)", "Milena Dravi\u0107 (Profesor's wife)", "Svetislav Gonci\u0107 (Goran)", "Du\u0161an Jani\u0107ijevi\u0107 (Una's father)", "Isabel Ines Madden (Stewardess)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
