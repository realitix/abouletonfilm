Paul Winters (35) is deputy public prosecutor in Arnhem and is working on his first major case: an investigation in to the allegations of a Bosnian girl that she was raped by three soldiers in the Dutch UN contingent and whose brother is alleged to have been killed by them. Winters suspects that the girl is telling the truth, but he can't prove it and the case is adjourned. Then one of the men gives a revealing statement that throws a different light on the case. Winters argues in favour of reopening the case, but faces opposition from an unexpected quarter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3zHu9o36VVnX6DvAwtxAZBBeRRw.jpg", "actors": ["Kees Boot ()", "Elsie de Brauw ()", "Hans Breetveld ()", "Erik de Bruyn ()", "Khaldoun Elmecky ()", "Thijs Feenstra ()", "Bert Geurkink ()", "Marc Hazewinkel ()", "Arend Jan Heerma van Voss ()", "Monic Hendrickx ()", "Marja Kok ()", "Merel Laseur ()", "Johan Leysen ()", "Jacques Luijer ()", "Willem Nijholt ()", "Roef Ragas ()", "Victor Reinier ()", "Tjerk Risselada ()", "Ronald Top ()", "Wimie Wilhelm ()", "Helmert Woudenberg ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
