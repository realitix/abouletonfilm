When I was a child, I would regularly force my poor mother and her friends to watch the opening number of The Lion King, then demand it to be rewound so we could watch it again. I made this film in a contemplative mood, with certain ideas flowing in my head and a certain nostalgia guarding me from the uncertainty of the future. As I was assembling it, I realized these ideas of analog and digital, impermanence, and the images that helped form me were not quite enough. I couldn't run away from the defining event of my life. This is for my father, overcome by life too young. Though the more I watch, I realize it is also for my mother, who has cared so deeply and profoundly for us in his wake.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1Tp4rPimSF2gWcDrwOYGQrT3hY5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
