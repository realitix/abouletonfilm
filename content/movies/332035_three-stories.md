In the first miniature, Schmitt films graves from the American Indian Wars as silent witnesses of a past that have left their traces on the collective American consciousness. Subsequently, we see blackandwhite street scenes in Hollywood, which are followed by almost familiar images \u2013 a garden bench, a bouquet of flowers. Thus history, the public and the private form a new, abstract and yet tangible unity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7UNOg5VtCmYPtbGvKZufRCUV5PX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
