Night of the Bandits of the Night from director Travis Irvine and Overbite Productions! In this hilarious horror spoof, a group of wild college kids arrive at Raccoon Creek Campgrounds with hopes for a summer full of good times, ample booze and hot pre-marital sex! But a pack of hungry raccoons, no longer content to scavenge through the garbage for their food, arrive to put a stop to the debauchery with their vicious dispositions and ravenous appetite for human flesh! As the bodies pile up, only two young lovers, with the help of a crusty hippie hermit and a bumbling park ranger, can stand up to the murderous masked menace and save the summer for drunken teenagers everywhere!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3cbiB8fA40ssYKZx47Tug0uZGCg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [38465], "youtube_key": "KriFgDuynu4"}
