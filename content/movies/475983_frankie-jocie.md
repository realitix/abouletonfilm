In an eloquent examination of desire and denial, Jocie attempts to make her brother acknowledge the violent face of homophobia recounting a time when she was attacked. Frankie candidly tells his sister about his own disempowering experiences as a Black man and recounts the time he tried to seduce her former lover.
