It\u2019s fair to say that once you lay eyes on his shorts, it\u2019s hard to shake their visceral effect in a hurry. Eleven years after first screening his work at SUFF, Umbilical World represents a curation of Firth\u2019s most popular shorts to date, each bookended by brand new transitional animations.\r Using surrealist techniques to explore depression and mental illness with some of the darkest humour this side of the twenty-first century (his work has been featured on Charlie Brooker\u2019s Screenwipe and Mitchell & Webb), Firth has become one of the world\u2019s most significant, independent animators. Umbilical World is a brain-melting celebration of Firth\u2019s short but prized career \u2014 a dog-stew of animated fancies from the scabland toybox that is his mind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3JHGu7Vv2iYo25BTRgiTgYegYA6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
