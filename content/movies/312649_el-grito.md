She covers a series of grisly murders and mutilations of well-dressed women, each of whom turns out to be a mistress of rich men, including her father-in-law. She sees patterns and shares them with Ibarra, the cop in charge of the investigations. Her editor gives her professional support, her friend Laura gives her emotional support, and her mother helps her guess when the next murder will occur.
