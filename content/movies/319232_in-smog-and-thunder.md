Animosity between Los Angeles and San Francisco had grown out of control. War was looming in the hearts of men and women from Petaluma to Pacoima. Then, in early May, General Juan Gomez de los Angeles led his Southern troops in an offensive against the Bay Area. Once the Battle of San Francisco began there was no turning back . . . In Smog and Thunder is a mockumentary about a California civil war set in a vaguely recent past.  - Written by Sean Meredith", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4nvfpuUf7A9Bmqe0gqoRWBXv5pu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
