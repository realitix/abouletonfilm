Later, Nanmura, a soldier on leave, steps on an ornamental hairpin in the public bath at the inn. Emi writes to the inn saying she has lost a hairpin and, when she discovers that it injured Nanmura, returns to apologize. The longer term visitors at the inn meet together to discuss the hairpin incident. These include a grumpy Professor, a young couple Mr and Mrs Hiroyasu, and an old man staying with his two grandsons. They hope to see a romance blossom between Nanmura and Emi, after Nanmura declares that there is something almost poetic in finding a hairpin in the bath.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yUgEmG1KHsI97FKtYwHTZP8znrD.jpg", "actors": ["Shin'ichi Himori (Hiroyasu)", "Kanji Kawara (Old Man)", "Hiroko Kawasaki (Okiku)", "Koji Matsumoto ()", "Hideko Mimura (His wife)", "Tsuneo Osugi ()", "Masayoshi Otsuka (Jiro)", "Chish\u016b Ry\u016b (Osamura)", "Tatsuo Sait\u00f4 (Professor Katae)", "Takeshi Sakamoto ()", "Kinuyo Tanaka (Emi)", "Kayoko Terada ()", "Jun Yokoyama (Taro)", "Munenobu Yui ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [81321, 184868, 128409, 79240], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
