While similar to other Tracy Anderson Method workouts, this post-pregnancy video focuses on regaining your abdominal strength and helping the skin on your stomach adhere to your muscles again. This is a restorative workout that I also recommend for older clients or people with injuries. This is a complete Tracy Anderson Method workout and is also great for beginners to the Method as they can also learn the basics and fundamentals. I recommend that you do this workout until you feel you have completely regained your strength and can begin your Metamorphosis workouts.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7ST1tjgm3FeSfk5w5luLYMGKyD4.jpg", "actors": ["Tracy Anderson (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "D7xwzP5IO6s"}
