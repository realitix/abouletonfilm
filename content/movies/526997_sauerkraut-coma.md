It\u2019s just as well his creature comforts are well catered for in the form of his grandmother\u2019s care-packages. But he has hardly had time to settle into his new post before he finds himself coming face to face with inner-city criminals. His father\u2019s car is stolen on his very first visit and although it turns up again before long, that\u2019s only the start of the trouble. The corpse of a young Serbian woman is found in the boot, and once again Franz finds himself with his work cut out.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z8w9wf8Lkc2bUUOwKTEv7IXxgek.jpg", "actors": ["Sebastian Bezzel (Franz Eberhofer)", "Simon Schwarz (Rudi Birkenberger)", "Lisa Potthoff (Susi)", "Enzi Fuchs (Oma Eberhofer)", "Eisi Gulp (Papa Eberhofer)", "Gerhard Wittmann (Leopold Eberhofer)", "Nora von Waldst\u00e4tten (Elisabeth Mayerhofer)", "Gedeon Burkhard (Karl-Heinz Fleischmann)", "Daniel Christensen (Fl\u00f6tzinger)", "Sigi Zimmerschied (Dienstellenleiter Moratschek)", "Stephan Zinner (Metzger Simmerl)", "Max Schmidt (Wirt Wolfi)", "Ferdinand Hofer (Max Simmerl)", "Thomas K\u00fcgel (B\u00fcrgermeister)", "Ulrike Beimpold (Margot Scheller)", "Philipp Franck (Damian)", "Frederic Linkemann (Karl Stopfer)", "Castro Dokyi Affum (Buengo)", "Michael Ostrowski (Pathologe G\u00fcnther)", "Goran Navojec (Onkel Dalibor)", "Markus Stoll (Verk\u00e4ufer beim Herrenausstatter)", "Eli Wasserscheid (Jessie)", "Viola von der Burg (Schmuckverk\u00e4uferin)", "Christian Steiffen (Partys\u00e4nger)", "Christo Klahr (Swingerclubbesucher)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [209232, 427027, 350160, 153518], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
