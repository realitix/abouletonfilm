Aaron, Stelios, Sakis, Galanos and Verios, \"the acrobats\", are best friends. School has closed for the summer holidays and the children spend their time playing games, running errands, and riding their bikes. Life is a game, into which they channel all their physical energy and imagination. They practice their diving abilities in a big cistern. It is a game through which their special talents and competitive spirit unfold. One is good at balancing acts, another at diving and another at somersaults. It is in this neighborhood that Aaron will spend the most important summer of his life: a rite of passage from childhood to adolescence, a time for learning about love, jealousy and friendship.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2G9IAMRIz1mpvSX1WUCUKhdlnWe.jpg", "actors": ["Yiota Festa (Koula)", "Giorgos Marinos (Mihail)", "Michalis Evripiotis (Aaron)", "Hristos Nomikos (Vangelis)", "Vana Rambota (Rodoula)", "Athina Pappa (Aunt Soso)", "Ersi Malikenzou (Anastasia)", "Paris Koutsaftis ()", "Yorgos Souxes ()", "Nena Menti (Eftyhia)", "Minas Hatzisavvas (Pentelas)", "Charis Kostopoulos (Lalas)", "Konstadina Koutsiou ()", "Achilleas Kyriakidis ()", "Alekos Mandilas ()", "Dora Masklavanou (Mother)", "Sotiriadis Miltos ()", "Sotiriadis Miltos (Verios)", "Themis Mitropoulos (Akis)", "Giorgos Pappas (Stelios)", "Dimitris Thomas (Sakis)", "Stathis Vrachas (Galanos)", "Nikos Zoiopoulos ()", "Themis Bazaka (Eleni)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
