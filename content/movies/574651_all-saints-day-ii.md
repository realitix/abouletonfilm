The film was hand processed and cut up into 2ft length\u2019s and then cut back together alternating from Joel\u2019s footage to Jon\u2019s until all the film was gone. This film is the follow up to ALL SAINTS DAY which was done using the same techniques the year prior soundtrack for this film was done the same way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8X0YBR4XtjYMZk3dqfHtT1xAfHW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
