A crew who can only trust each other in the kingdom of polar bears and sudden storms. Until now this has been an annual ritual for the obstinate, ageing skipper Bj\u00f8rne and his first mate Espen. In the beginning of the 20th century, more than 200 Norwegian sealing vessels were active, now there\u2019s only one ship left. Massive international condemnation and the EU ban on all imports of seal products has almost wiped out the industry. But the skipper and his first mate refuse to give in. With a motley crew of greenhorns and old-timers, they set out on the dangerous journey into the polar ice. They are the last seal hunters of Norway.  Sealers is a chilling feelgood roadtrip story of blood, sweat and frosted cream cakes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pdE9RVLGsCjMXh4HNjCiJRTtwQO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
