Rocking white pants, a white shirt, black suspenders, black belt, black boots and a bouffant, Monae was cool and effortless in her performance of \u2018Q.U.E.E.N.\u2019 Never straying too far from her black and white striped mic stand, Monae performed not only her vocals, but also stood in for partner-in-crime Erykah Badu\u2019s raps as well.  Not only is Monae fun to watch herself, but get a load of her backup band. How adorable do they look dancing along to the song?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pqhuh4xPhvCY91drFBPNHvSMy03.jpg", "actors": ["Janelle Mon\u00e1e (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
