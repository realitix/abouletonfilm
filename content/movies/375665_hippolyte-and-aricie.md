Rameaus inventive take on Racines great tragedy Ph\u00e8dre is brought to life by Paul Browns colourful and elegant designs and Ashley Pages playful choreography. Ed Lyon and Christiane Karg give captivating performances as the titular young lovers, while Sarah Connolly, making a welcome return to Glyndebourne, invests Phaedra with both grandeur and a desperately human vulnerability (The Independent). Leading exponent of early music William Christie sets an exhilarating pace, galvanising the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment to playing of tremendous panache (The DailyTelegraph).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/40pPiO46q8tvysJk3nGBLp6fJTw.jpg", "actors": ["Sarah Connolly (Phaedra)", "Ed Lyon (Hippolyte)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
