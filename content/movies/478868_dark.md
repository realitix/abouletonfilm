It tells the story of one Dark Freeman (Jason Bonner), a young African American man who finds himself torn between his tough urban roots - living as a resident on the impoverished, crime-ridden south side of Chicago - and his day-to-day life, in the comparatively wealthy and privileged University of Chicago, where he is enrolled as a student. Walking between the two worlds, Freeman must find a way to succeed in both, with the help of lovers, family members, close friends and acquaintances.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nTRNfA9gU8Kh4o5bU7UA24H37Uh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
