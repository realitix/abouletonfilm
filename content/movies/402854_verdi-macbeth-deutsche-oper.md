Verdi took great pains with this opera, displaying special enthusiasm for it as he concentrated on the main characters of Lady Macbeth, Macbeth and the witches. This recording of Luca Ronconi's production is conducted by Giuseppe Sinopoli, who brings fresh color to Verdi's score. The cast, headed by Renato Bruson and Mara Zampieri, are strongly supported by a fine-toned and adaptable chorus who ably meet the demands of Verdi's great \"chorus opera.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iMlg3LfYNRHnm8dUxH646NyRt2i.jpg", "actors": ["Renato Bruson (Macbeth)", "Mara Zampieri (Lady Macbeth)", "James Morris (Banquo)", "Dennis O'Neill (Macduff)", "Sharon Sweet (Dama de Lady Macbeth)", "David Griffith (Malcolm)", "Goetz Rose (Duncano)", "Claus Endisch (Fleanzio)", "Giuseppe Sinopoli (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
