When three friends set out to break the world\u2019s egg-tossing record, their relationships become increasingly entangled and complicated. In her arresting first film, director Manon Briand crafts poetic images that are striking, fresh and occasionally quirky, and elicits uncannily natural performances from her actors. Les Sauf-conduits garnered several awards on the festival circuit, including the award for Best Canadian Short Film at the 1992 Festival of Festivals (now the Toronto International Film Festival\u00ae) and Golden Sheaf Awards for Best Director and Best Film at the Yorkton Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/paRJD92NQYBAvaKuxXUPWrfd9DK.jpg", "actors": ["Julie Lavergne ()", "Patrick Goyette ()", "Luc Picard ()", "Yves Pelletier ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
