There isn't much opportunity in a small town for a teenage girl to make a living, so Yoshiko gives recorder lessons to the neighborhood kids - but when she learns that some of her pupils have caught the eye of a local pedophile, she takes up a part-time job as a vigilante! Her plans to do right by her odd array of students include brutal emasculation, but at the end of the day, the sweet young thing never forgets to reward her precious tykes with treats.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/NH5h4I5ZYQnuLKy6GeMXkJGh7O.jpg", "actors": ["Yoshimi Nozaki (Yoshiko Hayashi)", "Suzune Fujioka ()", "Michio Hisauchi ()", "Tatsunori Honda ()", "Peter Hyman ()", "Sh\u00fbji Iijima ()", "Daisuke Tajiri ()", "Junji Tamura ()", "Y\u00fbki Tokunaga ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "fOBToMO-A_U"}
