He explores a bit, then, it starts to rain. The saucer returns and drops a box to him marked \"SOS\" - it has a red button in the middle. He presses it, and the space ship drops an umbrella to him. Later he presses the button when he's hungry and when he wants companionship. The ship delivers food, a dog, a muscular companion, and finally a vivacious woman. The planet is soon populated by squalling children. Adam pushes the button again. The spaceship returns for what is probably the last time: will Adam and Eve get relief?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wfoI3VybqreiCzh0keEMtNxLzee.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
