The documentary provides a view into the compelling life histories and artistic creations of Harold Jeffries, Wayne Mazurek and Luke Tauber. While these men seem to have the odds stacked against them, they are able to turn their ideas into reality. With no formal art education or training, each of them transforms their vision into artistic works of expression free from cultural, political and worldly influences found in most art today.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
