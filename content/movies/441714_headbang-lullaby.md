Here, he is to await the expected but by no means certain visit of King Hassan II. Encounters with government supporters and the families of political prisoners; the mysterious appearance of a foreign woman and a Berber, as well as the story of a football crazy boy all prove to be a bit much for Daoud. Ever since the bloody \u2018bread riots\u2019 five years earlier, he has felt paralysed. But the euphoria and the hope he encounters here help to lift his mood. The Moroccan team\u2019s success unleashes a new self-confidence and lust for life that transcends the surreal shadow of the monarchy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nnZUbgu6JVIhRbADyXhZXCdlKLQ.jpg", "actors": ["Aziz Hattab ()", "Latefa Ahrrare ()", "Zoubir Abou el Fadl ()", "Benaissa El Jirari ()", "Salma Ed-Dlimi ()", "Adil Abatorab ()", "Zoubida Akif ()", "Jaouad Sayeh ()", "Nacer Mdaghri ()", "Saadia Marrakchia ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
