Shanna Strackbein didn\u2019t always know hers, but that all changed when her Papaw, Dewey Holden, pulled out an old box of slides that gave a window into his past she\u2019d only glimpsed before. Spurred on by this discovery, she asked her grandfather to tell more as she leafed through dusty albums in an earnest search to learn the rest of the story. Anchored follows her quest, tracing God\u2019s faithfulness in one family\u2019s life over five generations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3RbCfrvRgZVg8BudmwB8BBm0Ug9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
