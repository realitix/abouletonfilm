News footage shows her international appearances and visits with heads of state, including President Eisenhower allowing her to feel his face. The second half takes a day-in-the-(exceptional)-life approach to Keller's existence circa 1955. Made just 13 years before her death, Keller's famed tutor-translator-friend Anne Sullivan had already died, leaving her live-in replacement, Polly Thomson, to share the film's focus. From the time Keller takes her morning walk along the 1,000-foot handrail around her yard through her workday to her nightly reading of her Braille Bible, her serene acceptance of her life will amaze and inspire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p0eALU7P6kfyTO3d51Apz0wplRf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
