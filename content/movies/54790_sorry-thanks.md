Max (no emotional sophisticate) becomes obsessed, mostly with Kira, but vaguely with his curious lack of conscience as well. Kira, fighting to win a job she hates and running aimless romantic loops, faces the precarious double challenge of choosing a next step and charting a course back to sanity. Good luck leading with your heart, when your heart is an utter emotional idiot.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AanBwZSP6Q3ergM2cEE85TGSepa.jpg", "actors": ["Wiley Wiggins (Max Callahan)", "Kenya Miles (Kira Marks)", "Andrew Bujalski (Mason)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "vNrXej4hgtM"}
