This film follows Salisbury Cathedral's current choristers over Easter and through the summer term. The Cathedral's separate boy and girl choirs each contain 16 of the most musically gifted 8-13 year olds in the country. Their role, now as always, is to sing, day-in day-out some of the most sublime music ever written in one of Britain's most beautiful buildings. -", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
