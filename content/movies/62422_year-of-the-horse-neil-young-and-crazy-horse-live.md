Stitched together from archival material shot in 1976 and 1986 along with candid scenes of Young and the band kicking back between shows, this rockumentary is as ragged as it is direct. Concert performances include renditions of hits such as \"Sedan Delivery\" and \"Like a Hurricane.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3zlD32BjQhJszGXRsZJD3POshk5.jpg", "actors": ["Neil Young (Himself)", "Frank Sampedro (Himself)", "Billy Talbot (Himself)", "Ralph Molina (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "CoJicHPkPa8"}
