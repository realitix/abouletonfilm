An entrepreneur sets up a salt mine, hiring village men. When he pays only half the wages agreed upon, they sit down in a field of rocks. The boss calls the army, who encircle the strikers. The women watch, sacrifice a sheep, pray, ululate. During the second night, a young woman hides the bucket and rope of the town's well to keep water from the army. The strike galvanizes her: she's learning to read and has studied a city woman who visits the village. Now, as she removes her traditional dress and rejects a ritual to cast out her new rebellious spirit, will she gain independence as did Tunisia and the strikers?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jKFDOX37MuTVjO7S8H86o3Y7Bx0.jpg", "actors": ["Jean-Louis Trintignant (Entrepreneur)", "Leila Shenna (Rima)", "Kricheche ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
