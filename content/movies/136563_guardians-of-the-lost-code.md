Every human had his brije: The human cared for his brije and vice versa. When the human turned 13 the old shamans performed the ritual a synchronizing ritual trough which the human and the brije were able to transform into the warrior form: a physical state in which the human acquired the powers of his brije and extraordinary strength needed to perform acts of heroism.
