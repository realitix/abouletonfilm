Bateson believed that, 'The major problems in the world are the result of the difference between the way nature works and the way people think.' Seen through the relationship between father and daughter, this documentary is an invitation into 'systems thinking' and interrelationships in the natural world. 'Looking at what holds systems together is a radical step toward sewing the world back together, from the inside.'", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nm9NM0wHZZkN6QkJ6OILprhSvcX.jpg", "actors": ["Gregory Bateson (Himself)", "Nora Bateson (Herself)", "William Irwin Thompson (Himself)", "Fritjof Capra (Himself)", "Terrence Deacon (Himself)", "Ralph Abraham (Himself)", "Milton Berger (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [38764], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
