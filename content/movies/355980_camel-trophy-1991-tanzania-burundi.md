Camel Trophy is in fact all of these. 1991 and Camel Trophy travels to Africa for the second time in the event's history to tackle a 1600km route over little used tracks and traversing some of the world's most spectacular scenery teeming with precious wildlife. Travelling in identical Land Rover Discoverys the seventeen amateur teams from as many countries set off from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to fight their way through waist deep mud and two metre high elephant grass, climbing the hills of Burundi to the finish in the capital, Bujumbura. The target for the two man crew of each vehicle is to conquer natural obstacles along the way. They soon learn that only team work and determination will help them reach their final goal whilst keeping up a competitive edge through the challenging Special Tasks. Their prize is the Camel Trophy", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j5pwTvnPnQDr8EgkmF54Bk3gWkj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
