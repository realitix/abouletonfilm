On the most diverse street in the most diverse city in the most diverse country in the world, a team of National Geographic scientists swab the cheeks of some 200 random New Yorkers. The goal: to retrace our ancestral footprints and prove we are all cousins in the \u201cfamily of man.\u201d  Cutting edge science, coupled with a cast of New Yorkers \u2013 each with their own unique genetic history - will help paint a picture of these amazing journeys.
