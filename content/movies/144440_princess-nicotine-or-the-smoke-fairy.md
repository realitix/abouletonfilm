He discovers this, and imprisons them in a cigar box. He removes a flower from the box, which contains a fairy smoking a cigarette. Next, he leaves briefly while his smoking paraphenalia clears itself from the table and the flower reassembles itself into a cigar. He lights the cigar, then breaks a bottle containing the fairy, who interacts with him in various ways reeling from his cigar smoke, building a bonfire that he extinguishes, etc.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hSsBn5S2mH3EBFMbpfGy8T3L41a.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Panzer (The Smoker)", "Gladys Hulette (The Elder Fairy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [147282, 134757, 196396, 48277], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
