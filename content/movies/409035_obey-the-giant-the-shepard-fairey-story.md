Frustrated by his inability to gain respect within the confines of art school Shepard sets out to gain notoriety and acclaim by targeting the most powerful man in Providence, former Mayor Buddy Cianci. Risking expulsion and jail time Shepard plasters Andre the Giant's face over the image of Cianci on a campaign billboard. As word of Shepard's prank gets out, Shepard learns that art is a weapon and attention is both a blessing and a curse.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eNavovtButLOoygLgpOJGJtFLn.jpg", "actors": ["Joshua Wills (Shephard Fairey)", "Keith Jochim (Buddy Cianci)", "Patrick Collins (Dean Carter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
