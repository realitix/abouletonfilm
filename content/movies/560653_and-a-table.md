Through the window, we see the countryside. During the day, they remain seated at the table. The settings, light, and depth of field change: slowly we learn the vocabulary of the medium.  In the final shots, the camera is reflected in the windows, and we see lights being cleared away. The film itself, and not the man and woman at the table, has become the subject of the film.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Barbara Meter ()", "Mattijn Seip ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
