Obviously I was looking for this film, but not expected to reach at this level. The film was really brilliant despite the influence of plenty of other films. Yes, the ideas were borrowed from the movies like 'Short Circuit', 'I, Robot', 'RoboCop', Real Steel', \"Bicentennial Man', 'Transcendence', et cetera. But that did not bother me at all. I would call it an inspiration to make a new product out that already existed.\r\n\r\nIt was not completely depended on Dev Patel's role, otherwise woulda been a disaster. Its the Hugh Jackman, eventhough his character was not on the frontline, because of his presence, the movie was filled with some exciting and thrilling moment. His role was pretty much same to 'Real Steal', but showed in a different shade.\r\n\r\nSilly concept, even dialogues were so stupid. I don't know, maybe because of the South African accent. But the screenplay was very good. Fast and gets the point quickly than wasting time for buildups. One of the best robot movie and it will be remembered. Looks like the sequel will be more furious and going to be an action packed item, if there will be one. Worth to watch it at least once.\r\n\r\n7.5/10"}], "recommandations_id": [68724, 76757, 87101, 97020], "youtube_key": "HhNshgSYF_M"}
