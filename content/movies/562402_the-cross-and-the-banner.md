The popular Michel Galabru makes one of his early screen appearances as a thief who in his haste to escape from the law, stuffs a diamond necklace he has just stolen into a purse in a store. The woman who buys the handbag takes it home without inspecting its interior and leaves it where her husband notices it, opens it up, and sees the valuable necklace. Immediately jumping to the conclusion that his wife has been up to no good, his reaction leads to a separation -- and much worse.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u6uKGH5vh5AzpwqGFmzg3iMBnIj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
