Her parish priest, Father Daniel (Julian Sands) is under orders to convince her otherwise, as reincarnation does not accord with official Catholic doctrine. Instead, he agrees to journey with her to the site of her dreams of a previous life. Once there, they discover that all is just as she had dreamed it, and her former husband has remarried despite promising not to. Her arrival on the scene does not disturb the man, but it really upsets his new wife, who departs with her baby. Manika decides that it helps no one for her to remain there in Nepal, and returns to her home in the south. However, all this has caused a genuine crisis of faith for the priest who, witnessing all this, has had to grapple with some irreconcilable issues.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nPloQtYUfS40vUeTeanL5ebrcC8.jpg", "actors": ["Julian Sands ()", "Ayesha Dharker ()", "St\u00e9phane Audran ()", "Jean-Philippe \u00c9coffey ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
