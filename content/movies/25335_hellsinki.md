The wrong side of the law is seen through the eyes of Koistinen, a local police officer.\r The guys who fall into a life of crime have one thing in common: they all start by bootlegging, being sure money is an answer to all their problems. Money is a way out of a miserable life; it is a way to happiness and their modest dreams. They can stop doing criminal business as soon as they get enough money.\r When the guys start making more money with black-market booze, their hunger and their dreams grow bigger.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sx5yjvIvEs1Xc0m9oGJhfHYoqKi.jpg", "actors": ["Samuli Edelmann (Tomppa)", "Peter Franz\u00e9n (Krisu)", "Pihla Viitala (Monika)", "Kari Hietalahti (Kari)", "Juha Veijonen (Koistinen)", "Jasper P\u00e4\u00e4kk\u00f6nen (Korppu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [38821, 102249, 29670, 37988], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
