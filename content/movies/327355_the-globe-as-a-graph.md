Through melody, image, color, and natural sound, his film constructs a look at the connecting world we live in\u2014language, growth, time, man, and celebration; city, ocean, discovery, color, and light\u2014in 25 non-linear sections. The music, composed and performed by Cotten, was created simultaneously with the film, underscoring an expression of the intrinsic duality of human perception. Cotten employs a system to create an emotional compass for the viewer using three primary colors: red for dark outlook, yellow for uncertainty, and blue for optimism.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
