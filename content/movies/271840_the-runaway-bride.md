Then she becomes inexplicably locked in her hotel room, and a series of cops, robbers and kidnappers passes through. Desperate, Mary trusts the shifty chambermaid, Clara, who whisks her away to the mansion of wealthy George Blaine. There, Mary must pretend to be a lowly cook, but that seems better than sticking with the guy she was engaged to.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rBoUMuYFDVNnI3k8QCxBpCBu26p.jpg", "actors": ["Mary Astor (Mary Gray)", "Lloyd Hughes (George Edward Blaine)", "Natalie Moorhead (Clara Muldoon)", "Paul Hurst (Sgt.
