When Europeans first saw the plumes of these fabulous creatures in the sixteenth century they believed they must be from heaven and called them Birds of Paradise. The people of New Guinea make even greater claims. They say the birds possess supernatural powers and magic. But to find these birds in New Guinea is one of the toughest assignments and to witness their extraordinary mating displays is even tougher. David Attenborough introduces a young team of New Guinean scientists on a grueling expedition to find and film these Birds of Paradise; the holy grail of wildlife filmmakers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1c5W2torSDYx3IRnmEULLZpcWA7.jpg", "actors": ["David Attenborough (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [335016], "youtube_key": "bDP2csmRy00"}
