After a heady mix of American culture training and 14 hour night shifts, the job soon starts to take its toll. Counter pointing the fluorescent interiors of late night offices and hyper-malls with the uneasy currents swirling around the characters, JOHN &amp; JANE discovers a young generation of urban Indians that are beginning to live between the real and the virtual. However, this futuristic world of American aliases and simulated reality is not science fiction, these are the times in which we live. JOHN &amp; JANE raises disturbing questions about the nature of personal identity in a 21st century globalised world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bk2rOFpTMlICumGBgD5waGLGBK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [410965, 368620], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
