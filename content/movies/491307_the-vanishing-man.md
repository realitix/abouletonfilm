To his surprise and horror, he is arrested upon landing and accused of being a traitor in connection with the cargo he has been carrying - which, unknown to him, contained plutonium. Although he pleads innocent, Nick is not believed and is sentenced to a long term in prison. While in prison, he is subjected to special experimentation at a mysterious laboratory - with one unnerving, and unexpected, side-effect of the experiments being intermittent invisibility.  \u2014David McAnally", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jzhBX06HlgdJOjjzcFIPxqeoNSg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
