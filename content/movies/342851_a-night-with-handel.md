This performance-based film, A Night with Handel, stylishly dramatises some of the composer's most beautiful arias, linked together over the course of one night in present-day London. Presented by Handel biographer, Jonathan Keates, the arias are specially recorded by world-class singers, accompanied by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9HSFI3bIhVfFhJHGCnL8BUe1R0L.jpg", "actors": ["Sarah Connolly ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
