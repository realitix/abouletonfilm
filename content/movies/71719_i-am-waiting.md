Lost souls, they meet one night by a quay; she may be thinking of suicide. He invites her to his caf\u00e9, and perhaps he will rescue her from the cabaret where she's under contract to a vicious mob leader. When the boss insists on her return, J\u00f4ji is bitter. He also despairs over lost dreams. His brother has gone to Brazil to purchase a farm; J\u00f4ji planned to join him but now believes his brother abandoned him. When J\u00f4ji discovers a clue about his brother, he needs Saeko's help. Like a fighter in the ring, he pursues the truth relentlessly, without regard for his own safety. Will it cost his life?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1JINVk7OBVb3JsGfezP3Iql8g05.jpg", "actors": ["Y\u00fbjir\u00f4 Ishihara (J\u00f4ji Shimaki)", "Mie Kitahara (Saeko)", "Isamu Kosugi (Uchiyama)", "K\u00f4jir\u00f4 Kusanagi (Takeda)", "Hideaki Nitani (Shibata elder)", "Kenjiro Uemura (Police detective)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
