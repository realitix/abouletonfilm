But before, he has to go through Hell and Purgatory, facing mythical beasts and historical figures along his surrealist path with the help of his guide Virgil, a fellow poet.  Adapted from the 14nth century Italian classic, the Divine Comedy is a oniric musical trip without words, a thrilling experimental mix of animation, video art and imagination.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d5025PLW0X8hJnhNw4gVO0OVZM3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
