Director Nicole Ma spent more than a decade documenting Putuparri's journey, travelling with him and his family on numerous occasions to Kurtal, in the Kimberley's Great Sandy Desert region \u2013 traditionally a site of great significance as a place where people ritually make rain \u2013 as they fight for their native title claim over the area.  Set against the backdrop of this long fight for ownership of traditional lands, the MIFF Premiere Fund-supported Putuparri and the Rainmakers is an emotional, visually breathtaking story of love, hope and the survival of Aboriginal law and culture against all odds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bPKzPDZpdXkjlLOwQTaLXI6LNAU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
