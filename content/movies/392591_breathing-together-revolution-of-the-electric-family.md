It combines interview with famous U.S. militants of the '60s, such as Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman, with reenactments of their Chicago trials (i.e., the \"Chicago Eight,\" etc.). Other figures of cultural interest from the time, including Alan Ginsberg and Buckminster Fuller, are interviewed or featured. The filmmaker indicates his belief that powerful forces in the U.S. government worked together to suppress American radicals. This view, widely disbelieved at the time, has since been confirmed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eq8SeRcCTJQjyttkLRFsO9r9jjV.jpg", "actors": ["Don Cox ()", "R.
