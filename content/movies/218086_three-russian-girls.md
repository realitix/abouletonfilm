Set just after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the film stars Anna Sten as Natasha, a Red Cross volunteer who is dispatched to a field hospital located in an old pre-revolution mansion. American test pilot John Hill (Kent Smith), who'd been in Russia on a goodwill mission, is wounded in battle and brought to the hospital. As he slowly recovers from his wounds, Hill falls in love with Natasha. A last-act crisis develops when the hospital personnel are forced to move immediately to Leningrad as the Nazis advance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/te6pPA1ccaMZnPhYRRn4fTpo5tA.jpg", "actors": ["Anna Sten (Natasha)", "Kent Smith (John Hill)", "Mimi Forsythe (Tamara)", "Alexander Granach (Major Braginski)", "Kathy Frye (Chijik)", "Paul Guilfoyle (Trishin)", "Kane Richmond (Sergei)", "Manart Kippen (Doctor)", "Jack Gardner (Misha)", "Marcia Lenack (Shoora)", "Mary Herriot (Zina)", "Anna Marie Stewart (Olga)", "Dorothy Gray (Manya)", "Feodor Chaliapin Jr. (Terkin (as Feodor Chaliapin))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
