Along the way, she picks up Alex, the newly single friend she's always had feelings for, and her misfit younger brother Jamie, who recently was released from prison. On the road trip, the trio encounter off-the-wall characters and hilarious cameos that chew up the Texas countryside. In the end, the three must come to grips with their own issues of trust, abandonment, love, and ultimately hope.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i2IHjkEQ2xelarFsYp8LB8nkrrS.jpg", "actors": ["Arianne Martin (Rose Hewitt)", "John Elliott (Alex Doran)", "Frank Mosley (Jamie Hewitt Jr.)", "Jodie Moore (James Hewitt Sr.)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
