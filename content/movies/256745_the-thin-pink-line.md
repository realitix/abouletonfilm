Enter Chauncey Ledbetter, the quirky, potentially gay, prisoner convicted of murdering his high school show choir teacher. As filming of the documentary progresses, evidence increases that Chauncey might be guilty after all. Will the team prove Chauncey's innocence before his impending execution or will this be the end of him?
