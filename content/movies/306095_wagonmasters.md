In 2011, Volvo - the leading premium wagon manufacturer - will discontinue the sale of its last wagon model in the United States. There are some, however, who still cling to these vehicles and what they stand for in American culture. Wagonmasters, a full-length documentary film, offers glimpses into the lives of such wagon enthusiasts, and tells the story of the station wagon as it represents a changing America over the last one hundred years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ipW1O2H9dtF5N5l0NaI19a9kbL6.jpg", "actors": ["Wayne \"Spanky\" Cox (HImself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
