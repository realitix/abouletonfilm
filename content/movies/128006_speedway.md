Mac has treated Bill like a son since he took him in. One day at the track, Bill sees Pat Bannon, and tries his best to impress her, but to no avail. On his way to catch a flight, he tricks Pat into taking him to the airport and she gets even by taking him up in a plane. He hates to fly, but will not show her that he is afraid and when the plane breaks up, he is a hero for rescuing her. This gets him publicity and Renny offers him his car to drive in the Indianapolis 500. Bill breaks with Mac to drive the car and puts it on the pole for the race. Then Renny double crosses Bill and plans to drive the car himself since Bill has tuned it so well.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tKSF3iy5X9qXRwj6UY32cuGwnE9.jpg", "actors": ["William Haines (Bill Whipple)", "Anita Page (Patricia 'Pat' Bonner)", "Ernest Torrence (Jim MacDonald)", "Karl Dane (Dugan)", "John Miljan (Lee Renny)", "Eugenie Besserer (Mrs. MacDonald)", "Polly Moran (Waitress)", "Alfred Adam (Doctor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
