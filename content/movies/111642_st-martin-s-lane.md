Charles, who recites dramatic monologues, sees that a young pickpocket, Libby, also has a talent for dancing and adds her to his act. Harley, the theater patron who never knew Libby took his gold cigarette case, is impressed by Libby's dancing and invites her to bring Charles and the other buskers in his group to an after-the-play party. Libby comes alone. A theatrical career is launched.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gurlaKU0THaY36S1CFokyFLNIJ5.jpg", "actors": ["Charles Laughton (Charles Staggers)", "Vivien Leigh (Liberty aka Libby)", "Rex Harrison (Harley Prentiss)", "Larry Adler (Constantine Dan)", "Tyrone Guthrie (Gentry)", "Maire O'Neill (Mrs. Such)", "Gus McNaughton (Arthur Smith)", "Polly Ward (Frankie)", "Basil Gill (Magistrate)", "Helen Haye (Selina)", "David Burns (Hackett)", "Phyllis Stanley (Della)", "Edward Lexy (Mr. Such)", "Clare Greet (Old Maud)", "Alf Goddard (Doggie)", "Cyril Smith (Black Face)", "Romilly Lunge (Jan Duchesi)", "Ronald Ward (Jack Temperley)", "Carroll Gibbons (Himself - Orchestra Leader)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [256300, 57662, 40730, 148766], "youtube_key": "Hjvo_rH9iE4"}
