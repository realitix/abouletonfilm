Composed and arranged for a 60 piece Orchestra by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson feat. special guests Bilal, Dwele, Posdnuos, Talib Kweli and more. This premiere performance is still on the minds of many. Mixed and mastered by legendary Grammy award winning producer/mixer, Bob Power. The man behind hundreds of pop and jazz recordings for such artists as Erykah Badu, D'Angelo, De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest and more, he had also worked with Dilla while he was alive. Hiphop has never sounded or looked like this, welcome to a new era, a new scale and a new sound. Part of the proceeds of all Suite for Ma Dukes performances and recordings will go towards Maureen \"Ma Dukes\" Yancey and the heirs to the Dilla Estate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xykT9XYoyNarMSW9vZC6fDZe70P.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
