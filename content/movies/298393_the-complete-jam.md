A couple of entertaining interviews, a photo gallery, and a short (and, sadly, very poorly narrated) documentary on the band's history complete the portrait.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3kz9Tu5dPUxdsRhoELWV2PwQ2Yt.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Weller (Self)", "Bruce Foxton (Self)", "Rick Buckler (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
