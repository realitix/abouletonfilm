In the late 20th century, two singers fully met its specifications--Jon Vickers and Placido Domingo. Both were filmed in video productions of unusual quality, and a choice between them boils down, ultimately, to a question of personal taste. In this 1973 production, Vickers is given an effective context to set off his powerful, carefully considered characterization. Mirella Freni is an appealing Desdemona, Peter Glossop is a credibly vicious Iago, and the cast is solid right down to the very young future star Jose van Dam in a small supporting role. The chorus and orchestra rank with the world's best.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w4utKqEoUB8V9msGzpxbUuQQfmU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
