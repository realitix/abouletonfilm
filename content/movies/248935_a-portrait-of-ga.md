The film gathers together this elderly lady's everyday actions to offer an abstract insight into her life.  Margaret Tait described this film as follows: 'My mother seemed a good subject for a portrait, (she was there), and I thought it offered a chance to do a sort of 'abstract film', in the sense that it didn't have what you might call 'the grammar of film'. It's mostly discontinuous shots linked just by subject, in one case by colour, only rarely by movement'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wmwVXRKcXzZj2ecQEZuN4BJfpHa.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [179724, 178985, 273299, 132364], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
