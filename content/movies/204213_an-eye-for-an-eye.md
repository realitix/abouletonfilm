The scene is Lebanon, where doctor Curd Jurgens, worn out by a hard day, refuses to examine the wife of Folco Lulli. When the wife subsequently dies, Lulli holds Jurgens responsible. Stalking the doctor day and night, Lulli goads Jurgens into proving that he isn't neglectful. En route to a call at a remote desert outpost, the doctor discovers that his car has been sabotaged. Marooned in the middle of the desert, Jurgens meets his fate at the hands of Lulli in a scene straight out of Von Stroheim's Greed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hITsG8FGKjkqSW0mjqoarQKyLiP.jpg", "actors": ["Curd J\u00fcrgens ()", "Folco Lulli ()", "Lea Padovani ()", "Paul Frankeur ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
