First he moved to Brazil, and later to the USA. He never returned to Portugal. During his 20-year-long exile, he kept an epistolary correspondence with Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen. These letters are a testimony of the profound friendship between the two poets, letters of longing and of desire to \u201cfill years of distance with hours of conversation\u201d. Through excerpts and verses, a dialog is established, revealing their divergent opinions but mostly their strong bond, and their efforts to preserve it until their last breaths.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/82fNWgWy7TyuAn93m1RR99wkpVS.jpg", "actors": ["Eva Truffaut ()", "Pierre L\u00e9on ()", "Rita Dur\u00e3o ()", "Anna Lepp\u00e4nen ()", "Lu\u00eds Miguel Cintra ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
