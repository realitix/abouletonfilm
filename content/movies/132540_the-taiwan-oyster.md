Masquerading as a bender road-\u00ad\u2010movie, the darkly  comic film explores deep existentialist questions as the protagonists journey deeper and deeper into the Taiwanese countryside. Darin and Simon\u2019s quest for the perfect burial spot becomes a strange trip down Taiwan\u2019s picturesque East Coast Highway as they encounter the unique cultures of Taiwan, welcoming families, violent gangsters, and Nikita, another lost soul who joins their odyssey.
