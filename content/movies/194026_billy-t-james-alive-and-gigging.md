It was a last hurrah for James, whose transplanted heart gave out on him the following year, but it's a worthy swansong. His unique brand of humour is captured here at its affable, non-PC, best, with Billy T giving everything he's got - every gag is rounded off with his trademark 'bro' laugh - for a loudly appreciative audience. Guests include Sir Howard Morrison.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vaYMKz34SpUi0KJUnpchM95AUQ8.jpg", "actors": ["Howard Morrison (Himself)", "Billy T.
