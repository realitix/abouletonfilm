To add insult-to-injury Willie is also the store's designated 'Fired Man.\"; when a disgruntled customer demands that somebody-must-be-fired, Willie is summoned and summarily fired, only to be rehired when the now-satisfied customer has departed. Willie inadvertently adopts a four-year-old orphan at a cost of ten-dollars a week, and things go from bad to worse since Willie doesn't make ten-dollars a week. But, with the help of Mary, a beautiful young nurse, Willie manages to turn some corners and improve his lot in life, albeit with some skids along the way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vg0ewnugcj6C6y41JibBfRBdwuu.jpg", "actors": ["Eddie Quillan (Willie)", "Sally Starr (Mary)", "Frances Upton (Aggie)", "John T.
