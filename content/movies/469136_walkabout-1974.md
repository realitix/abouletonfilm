Mountford's films are an irreplaceable ethnographic record of the life of the Pitjantjatjara people of this area, before extended contact with European culture. It records food gathering and preparation, hunting, fire making and family life as well as scenes near and on the sacred rock formation, Uluru. This film was made from unrestricted footage shot by Mountford in 1940 and 1942 for his two 1946 films, Walkabout and Tjurunga.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6jEgeHpLPB7Ni1a0BsGkfLIodtW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
