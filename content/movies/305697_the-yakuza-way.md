He's going to smuggle it back to Japan, and it's to be his last score: he wants to marry Yoko, his long-suffering girlfriend, and get out of the life. But somebody sets him up, Yoko is shot, and he loses the suitcase of dope. He determines to stay in LA, retrieve the coke, and exact revenge: although he's a drug dealer, he still follows the samurai code of the yakuza. Along the way, he learns that his long-lost younger sister is in Los Angeles, and he teams up with an unlikely partner in his quest for justice: a petty thief who's trying to help a young woman get back to Japan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/txA3FOGkedF8UFm0MVAqpQgyLgX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
