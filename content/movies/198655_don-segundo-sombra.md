The author's nephew Adolfo Guiraldes, an expert on Argentine folk stories, was chosen to play the title role. The director used the book instead of a script, as he faithfully shot scenes page-by-page to insure the authenticity demanded by the writer's heirs. A handful of professional actors augment the largely local cast of this slice of Argentine life from the beginning of the 20th century.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yXK8z002YSCCRfCPpK9tOSyPtp8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
