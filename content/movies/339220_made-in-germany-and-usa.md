But even their child becomes a pawn in their egoistic power games and possessiveness. The crisis reaches a peak first then, when the husband finds out about an affair that the wife is having and sets out to claim the same rights for himself. This takes him to New York, where he settles. The wife gets her hands on all the cash reserves and follows him there. In spite of the new location, they still remain a couple with a disturbed and insensitive miscommunication, that instinctively cling even more to each other in the new and alienating environment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rZEZAEWgnxoimFpoLp0QQK9tdhX.jpg", "actors": ["Karin Thome (Liese)", "Eberhard Klasse (Karl)", "Alf Bold ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
