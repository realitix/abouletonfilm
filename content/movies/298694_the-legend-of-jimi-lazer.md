Inside, a cloaked witch presents an ordinary stratocaster. \"Is this it?\" he asks. \"This'll make me as famous as Hendrix?\" The witch smiles and Jimi takes what he came for. But there's a catch. The cost is more than he is willing to pay. Realizing she won't let him back out of the deal, he now lives under a curse. Jimi takes the guitar and disappears. No one hears from him again. Twenty-seven long years pass.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ArWHswhDRgMEKPd4sa20Ppdebqk.jpg", "actors": ["Robbie Beniuk (Jimmy Lazer)", "Patrick Mitchell (Freedom)", "Amy Landon (Zmoothie)", "Elijah Black (Righty)", "Robert Tanos (Red)", "Tanya Rigley (Hex)", "Christopher Elliott (Guitar Hunter)", "Jim Yorfido (Man In Black)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
