Ryo meets an American military solider named George, and they discover that they have more similarities than differences. The atmosphere of the film is heavily charged with discrimination and prejudice- Okinawans and Japanese (yes there is a difference-big difference in fact), US military and Japanese/Okinawans, officers and enlisted soldiers- and takes place with echoes of the civil rights movement lingering in the backdrop.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3cokU1pnUybyjJ0sPPS4cuAEuCU.jpg", "actors": ["Shogen Itokazu ()", "Mitsuki Koga ()", "Aoi Miyazaki ()", "Eri Ishida ()", "Hiroshi \u00d4guchi ()", "Katsuya ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
