This school is located only about 20 minutes away from Hanazono Stadium, the mecca of Japan\u2019s high school rugby, but it was not until 1994, 18 years after the foundation of a rugby team at the high school, that the Japanese education ministry approved the team\u2019s entry into the official league.  Since then, the team has run in the national league as a representative of the Osaka area and been considered a front-runner ever since. The team has strong players and passionate supporters, but it faces difficulties just before winning the league.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/waNQBAzm2RrQXaVPLzQIMsWmago.jpg", "actors": ["Moon Jeong-hee (narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "2fDJ0n5ZUNo"}
