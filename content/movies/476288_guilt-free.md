This Gothic, psychological melodrama follows the events that caused his descent into madness. The decision about what to do with the ashes of their recently deceased deadbeat father plays a central role in the fraternal turmoil. At 21, Esteban is the oldest son. He eventually returns to his hometown of Curerenavaca one year after his father's funeral. Esteban loves travelling around. He arrogantly calls himself a writer and considers himself among the intellectual elite. But despite his grandiose pretensions, Esteban is decidedly lacking in talent; however, his good-hearted, humble little brother Juan is brimming with it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/DLc05uiXzhrksNgDHmsnn4cMnH.jpg", "actors": ["Mart\u00edn Altomaro ()", "Natalia Barraza ()", "Rosa Mar\u00eda Bianchi ()", "Socorro Bonilla ()", "Susana Contreras ()", "Masha Kostiurina ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
