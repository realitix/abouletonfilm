With just 41 fluent Native speakers remaining, mostly Elders, some estimate their language could die out within ten years. The small community travels to a remote Island, where a language immersion experiment unfolds with the remaining fluent Elders. Young camper Sadie, an at-risk 13 year old learner and budding Alutiiq dancer, is inspired and gains strength through her work with the teachers. Yet PTSD and politics loom large as the elders, teachers, and students try to continue the difficult task of language revitalization over the next five years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/10hNotw3t1efufkyp37vR9Us8Sr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
