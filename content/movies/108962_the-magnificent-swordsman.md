One of them, as he is dying, asks Jiang to take his personal effects to his sister.  This being a Wuxia film, our hero is bound by a strict code of honour, and he agrees.  The bandit\u2019s sister, Xiu Xiu (Shu Pei-Pei), is surprisingly forgiving and tells him that he got mixed up in a bad crowd of robbers before he died.  As it happens, these self-same bandits are threatening to tear up the village at any moment, and Jiang prepares to defend it despite being despised by the town folk for killing Xiu Xiu\u2019s brother.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fTGlHCvhd0jqX5qVP4EnBjQfdnD.jpg", "actors": ["Wong Chung-Shun (Jiang Dan Feng)", "Shu Pei-Pei (Xiu Xiu)", "Tien Feng (Lei the \"Golden Snake Whip\")", "Cheng Miu (Huang Da Ba)", "Ngai Ping-Ngo (Xiu Xiu's Brother)", "Fan Mei-Sheng (villain who kills a woman)", "Ma Ying (villain in second fight)", "Chiu Hung (Merciless Bandit)", "Shum Lo (Village Chief)", "Ng Wai (Gen Sheng's mother)", "Little Unicorn (Bandit)", "Sammo Hung ([Extra])"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [61037, 64360, 65192], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
