Long desiring to help the weak, Kensuke Okochi gets a job at an attorney\u2019s office while he and his wife, also blind, look forward to their first child. When a plaintiff in a divorce case decides to withdraw from litigation, Kensuke worries at first that it has to do with his own perceived inadequacies as a lawyer, but a few days later, he is visited by the female plaintiff, Satomi, showing injuries to her body. While it appears an open and shut case of domestic violence with an audio recording as proof, Kensuke detects a \u201ccertain scent\u201d coming from the plaintiff which gives him pause as to her real intentions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lRTHfFLAqyumrNJNHw8buRA0Zox.jpg", "actors": ["Tori Matsuzaka (Kensuke Okochi)", "Nao Minamisawa (Natsumi Okochi)", "Mari Hoshino (Satomi Ando)", "Taiga (Masaki Yamanishi)", "Jiro Sato (Isao Yamaoka)", "Hidekazu Mashima (Kazuya Ando)", "Kei Yamamoto (Kenji Minagawa)", "Shigeru Izumiya (Toyoshige Shimura)", "Keiko Toda (Michiyo Tanabe)", "Satoshi Jinbo (Okada)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
