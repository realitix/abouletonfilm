Vivian Stringer is one of the most prolific coaches in the history of college basketball. She was the first to lead three different schools to the NCAA Final Four (Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Iowa and Rutgers) and received the highest honor of all in 2009 -- a place alongside Michael Jordan, John Stockton, Jerry Sloan and David Robinson as an inductee into the Basketball Hall of Fame. Coach Stringer became more well known to the non-sports world in 2007, when the words \"nappy headed hoes\" were used to describe the group of young women she led, in spite of tremendous odds, to the National Championship game that same year. Perhaps because Stringer is also a mother whose career successes have been intertwined with personal tragedy, her response to the 2007 incident showed she wasn't just a great coach, but the perfect example of grace under fire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6TQkEZMUYACv8W2GzybevUUJz9N.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
