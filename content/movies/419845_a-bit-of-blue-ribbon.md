On account of old age, Jim Hartwell, the ranch owner, orders Steve, an employee, to take the old horse into the foothills and shoot him. Kitty, Hartwell's daughter, loves old Senor and claims him for her personal property. Steve loves Kitty and refuses to shoot the horse. In anger, Hartwell discharges him. The ranch owner, mounting his horse, leads Senor to the foothills. He takes the bit of blue ribbon which Kitty had tied in Senor's foretop, and throws it aside. Just as he raises his revolver to shoot, he sees a Mexican creeping towards his horse in the act of stealing it. He turns his attention towards the thief, who shoots Hartwell. Steve appears, and fires at the Mexican, who in turn, shoots Steve and escapes. Steve, not seriously wounded, turns his attention to Mr. Hartwell. The Mexican makes his way afoot across the hills and comes across a party of range riders.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Mary Charleson (Kitty Hartwell)", "Anne Schaefer (Mrs. Hartwell - Mary's Mother)", "Bob Burns (Steve)", "Eagle Eye (A Mexican Bandit)", "Edward Elkas ()", "Charles Bennett (Jim Hartwell, Mary's Father)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
