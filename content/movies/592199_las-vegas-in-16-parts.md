The mass media reproduces and celebrates the image of Vegas based on gratuity and transgression. LAS VEGAS IN 16 PARTS proposes a flirtatious dialogue with this collective perception through an aesthetic of appropriation. The film cannibalizes the sheen of the city\u2019s voracious capacity for spectacle: from the 1950s, when atomic explosion tests became another tourist attraction, to the present, when a male stripper turns police brutality into the sensual fantasy of a bachelorette. A documentary about a concrete city, it inversely aspires to be a fiction of an improbable collective fantasy.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lbVC0h9F4ZcqiKye5CGum2vb8f4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
