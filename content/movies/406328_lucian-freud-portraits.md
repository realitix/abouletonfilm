They include several of Freud's friends and daughters, and the film becomes a depiction not only of his art, but also his private persona. Lucian Freud does not appear, with the exception of a brief shot at the end of the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v20akkXxPl54VgXlB4onZnDWD6b.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
