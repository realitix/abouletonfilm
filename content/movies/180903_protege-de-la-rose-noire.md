Ekin Cheng plays a dim-witted cab driver who wears a Robin costume and becomes Charlene's love interest. There is a bit of \"comedy\" as Rose confuses Ekin with her former lover and Gillian become jealous. A lot of time is wasted with this Three's Company-style shtick until eventually, some shred of a conflict comes forward, as the girls must battle a former protege of Rose who has taken to kidnapping to pay the bills.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/heiZFpWqMLU5m6ieYXR0W7B0uwg.jpg", "actors": ["Gillian Chung (Gillian Lu)", "Charlene Choi (Charlene)", "Ekin Cheng (Jim Lo)", "Teresa Mo (Black Rose)", "Faith Woo (Ms Wisteria)", "Chris Yen (Wisteria's assistant)", "Tats Lau (Gillian's physcology professor)", "Cheuk Wan-Chi (Social worker for single mom)", "Lo Hoi-Pang (Percy)", "Lo Meng (Mark)", "Hui Siu-Hung (Lee Shou Fu)", "Chan Man-Lei (Landlord)", "Gary Mak Wing-Lun (Fu's assistant)", "Victy Wong (Fu's bodyguard)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
