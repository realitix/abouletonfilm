I do believe that potentially licks originally was a short for liqour store (which the characters do 'hit' in this one) but not entirely sure. Mack 10 uses the term alot in his raps.\r\n\r\nAnyway the movie is decent, you can kind of tell that the director isn't the most experienced due to some pacing problems and whatnot but when all is said and done it turns out to be a pretty well thought of story.\r\n\r\nAlot of b-word and n-words thrown around if that is an issue."}], "recommandations_id": []}
