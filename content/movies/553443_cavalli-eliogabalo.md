Baroque and carnivalesque, Eliogabalo is not, however, an opera that advocates a return to order. Leonardo Garc\u00eda Alarc\u00f3n, a finder of baroque gems, and Thomas Jolly are careful not to transform Eliogabalo into a sublime icon who would abase virtue. On the contrary, the conductor and young director, who are presenting their first production for the Paris Opera, accept the character\u2019s contradictions and ambiguities", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yAMrFI5zRY1lnQdeSwlCcZdp2kv.jpg", "actors": ["Franco Fagioli (Eliogabalo)", "Paul Groves (Alessandro Cesare)", "Nadine Sierra (Flavia Gemmira)", "Leonardo Garc\u00eda Alarc\u00f3n (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
