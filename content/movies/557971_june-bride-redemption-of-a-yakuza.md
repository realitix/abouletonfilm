JUNE BRIDE: REDEMPTION OF A YAKUZA is a feature-length documentary about Tatsuya Shindo, a former mobster turned preacher, who seeks forgiveness for a life's worth of disappointment and crime in his makeshift church - June Bride - at one time a smoke-filled bar. Hanging on Shindo's every word is his loyal congregation, an eclectic mix of tattooed ex-convicts and wayward souls who want to start over. Through his journey from the criminal underworld to a mission from God, Shindo declares, \"Loyalty to my yakuza boss is the same as the one to God.\" But will his faith cost him more than just his finger?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9OpKdIocSvYkajZRiRd7aXCZTcO.jpg", "actors": ["Tatsuya Shindo (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
