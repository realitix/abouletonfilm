THE DEATH (OR POSSIBLE SURVIVAL) OF THE INDEPENDENT RECORD STORE, \"an elegy for a vanishing subculture...a lively, bittersweet film that examines - with caustic humor, brutal candor, and, ultimately, great affection - why roughly 3,000 indie record stores have closed across the nation over the past decade,\" (Johnathan Perry, Boston Globe).
