Aldo Raine.\r\n\r\nThis was my first taste of the popular director's eccentric repertoire, although I've since seen all of his movies except \u201cDeath Proof\u201d (2007). The first time I tried to watch \"Basterds\" I gave up around the 50-minute mark. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue-driven opening sequence is great but the film seemed to bog down with its focus on a French theater during the German occupation and the accompanying interminable dialogue (mostly in subtitles). I just wasn't ready for this because I was expecting a Dirty Dozen-styled WW2 film with lots of action and all that goes with it. What I got instead was a plot that focused on the aforementioned theater accompanied by long sessions of generally subtitled dialogue.\r\n\r\nI eventually gave it a second chance with the understanding that this wasn't some typical war flick. Strangely, the \"interminable dialogue\" pulled me in and I slowly became engrossed in the story, which isn't hard to follow. The drama is only occasionally interrupted by flashes of extreme violence. Until the end, that is, where all hell literally breaks loose.\r\n\r\nThere ARE elements that bring to mind \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), including a group of anti-heroes intent on mercilessly obliterating as many Germans as possible and the fact that the real action doesn't kick-in until the final act, but \"Basterds\" is hardly a Dirty Dozen clone. It may borrow a bit from notable films of the past but it absolutely possesses its own refreshing originality.\r\n\r\nAll effective films have quality characters and \"Basterds\" has several: The stunning M\u00e9lanie Laurent as Shosanna, the cinema proprietor who quietly seethes with retribution; Christoph Waltz as SS Col. Hans Landa, an articulate and suave love-to-hate villain who mercilessly hunts down Jews; Brad Pitt as the almost-comical, but no-nonsense leader of the brutal Basterds; super-sharp Diane Kruger as a German actress & British spy; and Daniel Br\u00fchl as a genial German hero with the hots for the beautiful Shosanna.\r\n\r\nLike Tarantino\u2019s other great movies (\u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d and \u201cJackie Brown\u201d), \"Basterds\" pulsates with confidence, style, quirkiness and a sense of the unexpected from beginning to end, the perfect antidote to the idiotic \"blockbuster\" syndrome that plagues modern cinema with its predictability and overKILL action & CGI, etc. Most movies seem like they\u2019re in a rush and shy away from extended dialogues because they fear losing the viewer\u2019s limited attention whereas Tarantino makes them a highlight because it\u2019s an area where he excels. Instead of pedestrian verbiage that merely advances the plot or conveys the obvious, his interchanges are rich with amusement and mindfood.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 153 minutes and was shot in France and Germany.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"}], "recommandations_id": [24, 393, 500, 1422], "youtube_key": "sE8hc4gVyGo"}
