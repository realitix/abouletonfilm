He decides to quit, but is soon lured back by one of his net-mates, Niki, who - when they meet for the first time - turns out to look strikingly like Juri. Niki has a web-address tattooed on his arm and when Juri types it into his computer, he gets drawn into a curious game that grants him the username RAT KING. As the game becomes increasingly dangerous, Niki vows to help Juri get through it. But the game triggers a series of life-threatening events and pretty soon Juri realizes that he is gaming for his life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vA1e5u5J9KO8kwuZ89plfnZDcxC.jpg", "actors": ["Max Ovaska (Juri)", "Outi M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 (Susanna)", "Janne Virtanen (Opettaja)", "Julius Lavonen (Niki)", "Niina Koponen (Mia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [79236, 20158, 78479, 18279], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
