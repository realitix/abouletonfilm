It based on their first single track, introducing the full album's release in October: a story about an eccentric football team, their dances and magical shoes set on a sandy playground surrounded by animals.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r Animated, painted & directed by the Italian artist Gianluigi Toccafondo, there is no keyframing, no filters no post production, over 5000 frames hand painted. Toccafondo has recently gained huge popularity thanks to the stunning 3 minute animation footage that opens Ridley Scott's new feature film Robin Hood.  Elephants like brasses and colorful bottomed women together with marvellous dancers are ready to enter the scene.\r Enjoy the show.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bT8lxkskEHPklGhU8yXR2Kf29gH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
