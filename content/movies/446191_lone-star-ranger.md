The first of these was Zane Grey's The Lone Star Ranger, previously filmed by Fox in 1931 with George O'Brien in the lead. Kimbrough plays Texas Ranger Buck Dunne, assigned to round up a gang of bank robbers. The leader of the gang turns out to be the \"respectable\" Judge Longstreth (Jonathan Hale), making life difficult for Dunne inasmuch as he's in love with Longstreth's niece Barbara (Sheila Ryan).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fSUeo3UUfUz0EUHdD0jEBsVvpmR.jpg", "actors": ["John Kimbrough (Buck Duane)", "Sheila Ryan (Barbara Longstreth)", "Jonathan Hale (Judge Longstreth)", "William Farnum (Texas Ranger Major McNeil)", "Truman Bradley (Phil Lawson)", "George E.
