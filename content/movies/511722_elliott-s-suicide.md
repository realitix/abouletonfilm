{"tmdb_id": 511722, "title": "Elliott's Suicide", "original_title": "Elliott's Suicide", "slug_title": "elliott-s-suicide", "date": "2007-01-01", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "A homage to the late American singer-songwriter Elliott Smith, Elliott\u2019s Suicide is a sentimental 15 minute tribute, lacking Anger\u2019s usual irony for obvious reasons. The film begins with shots of friends\u2019 and fans\u2019 last words written on Smith\u2019s memorial on Sunset Boulevard, then to footage of a Macy\u2019s parade, focusing closely on the oddly outfitted participants, some in renaissance attire, cowboys with lassos, and beauty queens. The film is scored with Smith\u2019s music, resulting in a melancholy effect, especially in the segment that follows Smith through the woods and films him as he digs up a guitar, then plays a song. This footage is repeated in the end of the film, but in a negative reversal print, suggesting pretty damn clearly that the subject matter has moved beyond the veil.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yLfr8ARJhtdA5pVbF18GymHdOcm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
