She: a photographer. He: a musician.\r Both up-and-coming. The first love. But an invisible conflict, an unnamable shame, stirs between their sheets. An insidious power game is in play, with its rules changing like music beats at the parties in Gothenburg, Stockholm and Ibiza. Behind closed doors and beautifying filters lies a raw reality where Mika\u2019s control over her mind and body is at stake. But Mika rips apart relationship prejudices and explores what really makes our pulses quicken in matters of the modern heart.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8Eu3fxdX4FYBmKVljBHrg5flItZ.jpg", "actors": ["Fanni Metelius (Mika)", "Ahmed Berhan (Tesfay)", "Leona Axelsen (Li)", "Daniella Mir (Dafne)", "Suzanne Reuter (Mikas mamma)", "Claes Hartelius (Mikas Pappa)", "Rojda Sekers\u00f6z (Nadja)", "Juliet Vergara Rodriguez (Nicole)", "Samuel M.
