This was the fourth consecutive win for the North Division champ in an odd-numbered year - Nebraska in 1997 and \u201999, Colorado in 2001 and KSU in 2003. Two of the nation\u2019s testiest defenses entering the game allowed almost 1,000 yards (917 total), but the Wildcats limited the nation\u2019s No. 1 scoring team (48.3 points per game) to a touchdown and added a defensive score to ice the game with 10:16 left to play. Sophomore linebacker Ted Sims had perfect placement for a 27-yard interception return for the fifth K-State touchdown of the night.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iNLQy50Hf2c0YfkZi8qqxN0UiUE.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Snyder ()", "Darren Sproles ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "WskyXvn17J0"}
