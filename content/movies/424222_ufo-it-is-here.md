Convinced that they've just witnessed a meteor landing the students follow the trajectory to document the event with their camera. In a forest area they discover a burned crater. Since it's too dark to film they decide to spend the night in their van. The next morning one of them is missing. The remaining students find first a trail of blood and then the torn up pieces of what used to be their friend. Soon they realize that something is hunting them - something that's not from this world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kQmCYUlj1VVt2syejZhI1dKMF6h.jpg", "actors": ["Laura Berlin (Melissa Stein)", "Leonard Hohm (Erik Greven)", "Fabio Cimpeanu ()", "Nika Cimp ()", "Olga von Luckwald ()", "Dennis Mojen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
