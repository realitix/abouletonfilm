The next thing you know, a SWAT team armed to the teeth is bursting into his house and giving him the fright of his life. This is all streamed live on camera, of course, so everyone can be in on the joke. Swatted is a cinematic exploration of this phenomenon based on 911 calls by offenders, YouTube videos of games and raids, and first-hand accounts of what it\u2019s like to be swatted.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xzqpxpo8yjPWczWQaJ3Vgi9ye00.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
