A hapless stockbroker named Charlie finds himself caught up in a twisty web where no one \u2014 no one at all \u2014 is telling the truth. Charlie isn't very good at his job \u2014 something his powerbroker boss Jay explains to him in exactly so many words. But then Jay also offers him an opportunity: a vague and somewhat shady opportunity, sure, but Charlie doesn't have much choice. And before long Charlie finds himself mixed up with all manner of dangerous characters, persistent detectives, beautiful women wearing surprisingly little, and a threatening and mysterious individual named Roland Gow.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rNrqlgWrPixy84yerex4zb8qFYr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
