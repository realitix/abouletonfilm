The disc contains a standard full-frame transfer. English soundtracks are rendered in both Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Digital Stereo. There are neither subtitles nor closed captions on this release. In addition to over 20 songs, the disc contains a photo gallery and interviews with the individual members of the band.
