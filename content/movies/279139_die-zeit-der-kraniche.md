She is on the cusp of adulthood, confronted with the challenges of the present and the pains of the past. She often feels lonely in the childhood-remote world in which she lives, in which schools are closed and people leave. Even the father, who has withdrawn from the world, is increasingly becoming a problem for Lea, who longs for fellowship.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7kfSLFB20WkSeZ9v8wOmfHJIuJI.jpg", "actors": ["Stella Kunkat (Lea Borchardt)", "Bernhard Schir (Lutz Borchardt)", "Floriane Daniel (Ines Sch\u00fctt)", "Manfred Zapatka (Kommissar J\u00fcrgen Monhaupt)", "Alice Dwyer (Eva Schreiber)", "Armin Dillenberger (Karl-Heinz Schreiber)", "Marie Gruber (Wirtin)", "Wolfgang Maria Bauer (Manfred Fuhrmann)", "Johann Hillmann (Anton Fuhrmann)", "Michael Wiesner (Mikey Fuhrmann)", "Doris Schretzmayer (Cora F\u00fcrst)", "Felix V\u00f6rtler (Georg Reitinger)", "Finn Benthin (Ines Sch\u00fctts Sohn)", "Jule Dormann (Leas Freundin)", "Evelina Sidikowa (Leas Freundin Marie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
