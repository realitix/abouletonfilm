They were given a grand name- \u201cStudents with Aspirations\u201d. These children, who face a great deal of pressure just to get by, are an enormous inspiration, with their remarkably hard work, their diligence and their self-respect. They are courageous in facing what fate has dealt them and they dance, even without music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kcpHyiWOppeiOATQSDHYaNJ9vvY.jpg", "actors": ["Fu Lei ()", "Zheng You ()", "Wu Xiaoliang ()", "Wei Li ()", "Li Kechun ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
