It's not really that funny, but enough of the characters are engaging for you to want to finish the film.  It won't set your world on fire, but you might get a few laughs.\r\n\r\n6/10 but probably deserves a 5.5/10"}], "recommandations_id": [385317, 214218, 17236, 74718], "youtube_key": "J56ahptxFNU"}
