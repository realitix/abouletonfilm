Each car not only runs on tracks but also has a set of tracks over its top, permitting an oncoming car to go over it. The camera was placed close to a platform on which the passenger-laden train ran, and the over-and-under vehicle demonstrated its unusual capabilities several times.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
