Directed by Scheme Engine, the doc is broken up into segments named for the album's tracks (\"Brooklyn's Finest,\" \"Can't Knock The Hustle,\" \"Politics As Usual\" \"Friend or Foe,\" \"Dead Presidents II\"). The film features interviews from members of the Reasonable Doubt production team (DJ Clark Kent, DJ Premier, Ski) as well as album cover photographer Jonathan Mannion, Reasonable Doubt guest artist Memphis Bleek, and Roc-a-Fella co-founder Kareem \"Biggs\" Burke. Lest you think the doc will be exclusively talking heads, the film also features footage of Jay Z performing tracks off the album in a studio and at Barclays Center.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wx43aW4OX4a8G0fPzpj0drlMkc7.jpg", "actors": ["Jay-Z (Self)", "Briant \"B-High\" Biggs (Self)", "Kareem \"Biggs\" Burke (Self)", "DJ Clark Kent (Self)", "DJ Premier (Self)", "Emory Jones (Self)", "Kyambo \"Hip-Hop\" Joshua (Self)", "Jonathan Mannion (Self)", "Memphis Bleek (Self)", "Peter Panic (Self)", "Gee Roberson (Self)", "Ski (Self)", "Tyran \"Ty Ty\" Smith (Self)", "Tone Hooker (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
