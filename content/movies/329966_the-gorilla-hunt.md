Two of these were sent to the Belgian Government and one to the Smithsonian Institution. The explorer also brought away with him three young gorillas, one of which weighed 125 pounds and put up a good battle before he surrendered. Mr. Burbridge shows some amusing scenes with these animals, one of them being that of a young gorilla who insists on getting tangled up in a drum of film.
