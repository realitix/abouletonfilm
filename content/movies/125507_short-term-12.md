Denim is the head counselor, involved somehow with Natalia, another counselor. During the day, we watch them and other staff deal with a boy who's getting into fights though he has only a week to go before his 18th birthday, a girl whose birthday it is, a foul-mouthed lad, and others. Denim uses music to calm one youth, orients a new staff member, sneaks a marijuana cigarette during a break, and by the day's end, talks to Natalia. Do any of us have it together?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5lo5z5H9w1z6AOn6vyuGf3gsN7I.jpg", "actors": ["Brad William Henke (Denim)", "Tania Verafield (Natalia)", "Lakeith Stanfield (Mark)", "Adam Shapiro (Scott)", "Phoenix Henke (Jayden)", "James J Hansen (Sammy)", "Katelin Chesna (Chelsea)", "Whitney Ball (Merrily)", "Andy Bonilla (Luis)", "Jared Callahan (Melvis)", "Joy Cretton (Sugiyo)", "Alexis Faust (Rachel)", "Ryan Fernandez (Momo)", "Christian Gutierrez (Brook)", "Maggie Jacobs (Julie)", "Mary Jacobs (Talula)", "Christopher James (Marlon Delaware)", "Rebekah Macias (Madesol)", "Hector Meza (Thomas)", "Kevin Moon (Vance)", "Brea Renee (Spring)", "Summer Stephana (Tanesha)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
