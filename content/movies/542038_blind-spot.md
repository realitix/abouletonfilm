Tuva Novotny has made a hard-hitting film that has to be described as one of the most impressive feature debuts in recent years. Blind Spot tackles the grey areas of mental illness; the blind spots that can be so difficult to detect. For 98 intense minutes we follow a mother\u2019s struggle to understand her daughter Tea\u2019s crisis as it affects the entire family. Pia Tjelta is formidable as Tea\u2019s mother, especially considering the fact that the entire film is shot in one single take. The same has to be said of Mathea \u00d8ien fantastic acting debut as Tea.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e8UfcpEEa1eTTkCLhjbhQPX5HJk.jpg", "actors": ["Anders Baasmo Christiansen (Anders)", "Pia Tjelta (Maria)", "Oddgeir Thune (Martin)", "Per Frisch (Hasse)", "Carl Munck (Johan)", "Nora Mathea \u00d8ien (Tea)", "Marianne Krogh (Mona)", "Ellen Heyerdahl (Anna)", "Hilde Linseth St\u00f8mer (Nurse Coordinator)", "Teodor Barsnes-Simonsen (Bj\u00f8rn)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
