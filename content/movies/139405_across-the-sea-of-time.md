Close to Ellis Island he gets off and thus starts his journey to America the same way as all immigrants in former times. Thomas is searching for the family of one of his ancestors, who had emigrated decades ago, but once sent a letter home together with a sample of his new profession: 3D-Photography. The boy follows his relative's traces by counter-checking the old 3D-Photographs of New York (using an antique viewer) with the same places and how they look today. This way, the audience gets to see the Big Apple in former times as well as today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lKOAyy098yjoot8cutYsStVO1WS.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Reznick (Tomas Minton)", "John McDonough (Freighter Chief)", "Avi Hoffman (Seaman)", "Matt Malloy (Wall Street Businessman)", "Abby Lewis (Julia Minton)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
