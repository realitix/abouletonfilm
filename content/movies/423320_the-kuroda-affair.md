As his clan\u2019s new leader, Tadayuki, becomes increasingly militant in his opposition to the Tokugawa shogunate, Daizen is forced to reconcile his loyalty to the clan with his loyalty to Tadayuki, who seems dead set on entangling the clan in destructive conflict. The Kuroda Affair\u2019s mise-en-sc\u00e8ne is said to have influenced future Toei director Eiichi Kudo. The film also features two of the greatest stars of Japanese period cinema, Chiezo Kataoka and Ryutaro Otomo.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/prHbYLdouYeZaTrg8v8Dz3gpVqU.jpg", "actors": ["Chiez\u00f4 Kataoka ()", "Ryutaro Otomo ()", "Eijir\u00f4 Kataoka ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
