The buildings look about right. The clothes are the same. The kids listen to hip-hop and hard rock. Birmingham's neighbourhoods are roughly the same too: Aston, Digbeth, Nechells, The Jewellery Quarter &amp; more.  But instead of a city, they are a loose collection of gangs and petty rivalries, tied together and policed by the weakened and corrupt forces of The Crown. These gangs aren't quite like our gangs though. They don't have guns.  They have swords, spears and the ancient martial traditions of the Far East. Each neighbourhood has their own power structure, their own laws and their own fighting style.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8qociKBFQFl0cvxbpnln4yi895Z.jpg", "actors": ["Zara Phythian (V)", "Beau Fowler (J)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
