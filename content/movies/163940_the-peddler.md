Armed with a camera, a lamp for night shoots, and enough charm to persuade entire towns to join in on his dreams, this tireless, jolly DIY veteran rolls in his beat up old car from one backwater Argentine town to another, where, in exchange for room and board, he turns out a feature film in 30 days. Adapting one of his ready-made scripts to each town, he temporarily transforms these sleepy villages into bustling back lots and the bored populace into avid performers. Coupling high energy with irresistible salesmanship, Burmeister keeps in constant motion. It took the combined efforts of three filmmakers to keep up with him, and their camera is there to capture his every move, recording his reflections on life, his recollections of his past, and his remarkable ability to solve a host of on-set mishaps.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ycpoxwHgBiAZa0mrpfgvuY53uoh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ME7onlnVwfU"}
