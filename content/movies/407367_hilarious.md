Hilarious presents a stand up monologue of a female comedian performing live in front of a studio audience. If humor is a mechanism set to cope in particular ways with disturbing, sometimes forbidden topics, this performance not only offsets these structures through their failure, but also offers a different manifestation of these topics, left exposed without the guise of laughter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p4o9eDh37VBdShrnYMMDoipIiWY.jpg", "actors": ["Hani Furstenberg (Roee Rosen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
