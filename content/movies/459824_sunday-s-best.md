In particular, the relationship with Christian imperialism and its impact on his tribe: the Ashanti.  Sunday\u2019s Best considers how belief systems within the diaspora are inflected by these colonial histories in the present day. The work is a confluence of the vivid sounds and images of praise and worship sessions in a Ghanaian community church married with the stark interiors of a Roman Catholic Church. Documented across a number of sites in London, Sunday\u2019s Best maps out a narrative of coming to terms with the incongruence of faith practices that straddle western and non-western influences.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
