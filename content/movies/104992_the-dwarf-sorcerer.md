This training, however, takes much less time than it would in most martial arts films, in which the kid would attain mastery at about the same time he reaches adulthood. Instead what we get is a sword-wielding 5 year old waging a bloody war of revenge against an assortment of adult-sized demons and people in heartbreakingly threadbare monster costumes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sAx7eFz9AXtFf55otN5SEK1bSfH.jpg", "actors": ["Lan Bao (Fei Tien Tung)", "Yueh Yang ()", "Cheung Kwong-Chiu ()", "Lin Yueh Yun ()", "Liu Ping ()", "Ko Hsiao Pao ()", "Chu Ga-Wai ()", "Cheung Ching-Fung ()", "Ma Cheung ()", "Ngok Fung ()", "Wong Yung ()", "Chang Ping-Yu ()", "O Yau-Man ()", "Chiang I-Chun ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
