The brash, headstrong young man is fixated on with the Second World War. He feels a sense of frustration at the irrational sacrifice of young people's lives during the war six decades earlier. Daisuke finds that he can vent his frustrations to Kimuro, who experienced the war firsthand. Kimuro's wife, Emiko, is also troubled by memories of the war. She lost a loved one in the war and has never gotten over it. And Kimuro himself also has something from the past that he has yet to face. He believes that the burden of his unresolved past will eventually be the death of him. When Daisuke's neurosis causes him to quit school, life changes for all three of them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/riDjsS8OnyFHdl5RWvkLolNSDSq.jpg", "actors": ["Hiroyuki Nagato ()", "Ineko Arima ()", "Yoshio Inoue ()", "Rie Miyazawa ()", "Masatoshi Nagase ()", "Tadanobu Asano ()", "Takako Uehara ()", "Kaori Momoi ()", "Seijun Suzuki ()", "Shingo Katsurayama ()", "Erika Oda ()", "Ichir\u00f4 Ogura ()", "Kazuya Takahashi ()", "Ginpachi Ginza ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
