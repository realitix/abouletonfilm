On the trail of the 2007 Dakar Rallye \u20187915 KM\u2019 undertakes a search, along the way encountering the variety to be found in Africa\u2019s present in Morocco, Sahrawi Republic, Mauritania, Mali and Senegal. \u20187915 KM\u2019 demonstrates the extent of this distance, which is the result of political and economic conditions, and also the ideas and  prejudices to be found in both Europe and Africa.
