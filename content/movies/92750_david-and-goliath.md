When the Philistines attack, the Israelites are hopeless against the fierce giant Goliath and don't know what to do. King Saul takes the advice of the prophets and sends an adolescent shepherd, David, into battle to conquer the oversized Philistine. David is victorious and becomes the King of Israel.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iTnBlaRc6GmFAq3hcEYqGAqcfLv.jpg", "actors": ["Orson Welles (Re Saul)", "Ivica Pajer (David)", "Hilton Edwards (Samuele)", "Massimo Serato (Abner)", "Eleonora Rossi Drago (Merab)", "Giulia Rubini (Micol)", "Pierre Cressoy (Jonathan)", "Furio Meniconi (Asrod, re dei Filistei)", "Aldo Pedinotti (Golia)", "Dante Maggio (Cret)", "Luigi Tosi (Benjamin Di Gaba)", "Umberto Fiz (Lazar)", "Ugo Sasso (Huro)", "Emma Baron (madre di David)", "Fabrizio Capucci ()", "Carlo D'Angelo ()", "Ileana Danelli ()", "Carla Foscari ()", "Roberto Miali ()", "Renato Terra ()", "Gabriele Tinti ()", "Nadia Lara ()", "Marina Riccardi ()", "Simonetta Simeoni ()"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "talisencrw", "content": "This was interesting, and I watched it only because I both love swords-and-sandals epics and am a huge Orson Welles fan. This gets huge bonus points because only Welles would insist on making sure he got to direct every scene that he acted in. That's awesome--and craftsmanship and artistry such as his should never be denied, simply for the sake of cinema."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
