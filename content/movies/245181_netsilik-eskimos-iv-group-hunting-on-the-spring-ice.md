There are sounds of running water, and melt ponds shine everywhere. The woman carries heather and moss to camp and the man makes a whirling bullroarer for the boy. Another child pretends to drive a dog sled. A woman is working sinews into bowstrings, while another is busy with a seal skin. A woman prepares to cook a meal and a man makes a bow from bone and sinews. It is a demanding task to combine such materials into a strong supple weapon; the result is pleasing to the man. The next day the men move out on the sea ice with a dog to look for seal pups.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3QTKNPXBTIL8TxSW3QfXpytOMAT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
