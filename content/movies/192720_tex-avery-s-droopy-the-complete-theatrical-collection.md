Droopy, the phlegmatic basset hound, was one of the few characters Avery used regularly: His low-key presence was the perfect counter to the extreme takes, fast cuts, frenetic action, and general mayhem going on around him. Avery is also noted for \"self-reflexive gags:\" the characters know they're in a cartoon and often comment on the fact. In \"Dumb-Hounded,\"a sprinting wolf cuts a corner too sharply, skids past the sprocket holes at the edge of the film, and onto the blank screen. Droopy frequently turns to the camera and comments, \"You now what? I'm happy.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vbbVmy62ZEDJZmfSvq6CMfcfeMC.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Thompson (Droopy)", "Frank Graham (Killer)", "Paul Frees (Joe Wolf (Most Common Antagonist))", "Daws Butler (Wolf)", "Billy Bletcher (Spike)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
