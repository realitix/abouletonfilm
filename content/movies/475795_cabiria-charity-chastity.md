We witness Chastity\u2019s journey through the eloquence of incoherence. It's about the illusion of significance in a surreal, unjust and often unintelligible world, yet finding meaning within it and retaining a form of hope in despite of it. Chastity finds an uncompromising way of realizing reality is a kind of absurdity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/izsAUhCeN83X8Iy5oLua0VG8Zh.jpg", "actors": ["Maya Rudolph (Chastity)", "Fred Armisen (Aldo the Instructor)", "Greta Lee (Nina the Showgirl)", "James Ransone (Anthony the Strongman)", "Natasha Lyonne (Jules)", "Macaulay Culkin (Spectre / Tough One)", "Leslie Odom Jr. (Jack the Juggler)", "Matt Lucas (Panhandler)", "Waris Ahluwalia (Bob the Bandleader)", "Kenna Lott (Coco)", "Alexa Lawerance (Young Chastity)", "Rocky Hinds (Casper)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "e7Mtzhymj1A"}
