Our employees in Parliament are in a madhouse. Among them they understand, but they do not know what reality is. They mixed up their private interests with party. The future are nuclear power plants, incinerators, parking lots, bridges on the close, the tunnel in the Susa Valley, DTT and the judiciary on a leash. They have delusions to \"Veltrusconi\".
