Shashbhushan, now blind, reflects on his past. Stimulated by sounds - songs, crows, traffic, and an electronic lighter - he recalls the now-vanished arts and literature scene of post independence Calcutta. The old man lives in a crumbling aristocratic mansion in the heart of town, which he shares with his teacher's daughter, Sarama, and her young son Shumon. During a vacation in the country another man enters their lives. Gangan was born blind and is a talented singer. Gangan and Sarama engage in a secret affair as Shashibhushan recalls his own wife, who he lost because of his uncontrollable sexual appetite.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jrEluZMDlLQRZl4L0Ni3BYTMlJC.jpg", "actors": ["Soumitra Chatterjee ()", "Indrani Halder ()", "Debashree Roy ()", "Roopa Ganguly ()", "Anjan Dutt ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
