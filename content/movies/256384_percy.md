Though Banubai, Percy's mother, utterly dominates Percy's life, she does so with love and kindness. Percy holds a clerical position in a small Unani pharmacy, famous for its sexual restoratives. It is only at his place of work, where he wields some power, that Percy displays a measure of authority and self-assurance. One day, Percy discovers a fraud in the office accounts, as a consequence of which one of the junior employees is sacked. This event has far-reaching consequences in the lives of Percy and Banubai. Percy's peace is soon to be shattered.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1mvuebSIP5ulU5inwYeNHXBj07p.jpg", "actors": ["Ruby Patel (Banubai)", "Kurush Deboo (Percy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
