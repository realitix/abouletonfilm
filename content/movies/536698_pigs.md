His mother has lost her baby and is so wrapped up in grief she barely takes any notice of her son. A sick piglet gives Iseng an idea: in an attempt to comfort his mother and gain her attention he places the animal in the empty cradle. But when his mother discovers the piglet, it is already dead. Revolted by the sight, she initially rejects her son. But then she recognises Iseng\u2019s need for love. Concentrating on looks and gestures rather than words and music \u2013 both of which are absent \u2013 this short film makes a silent appeal not to dwell on what is lost but to recognise and cherish life\u2019s gifts.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bjB90QuOHYlpTbnCAjsPF1sALS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
