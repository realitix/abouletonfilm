Pintilie creates a strange combination of carnival scenes which is brought to the screen as a burlesque, fast-paced, screwball comedy with a meditative undertone. This film was banned in Romania for a decade until the death of Ceausescu in 1989 and was only released after the 1989 revolution.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ezv3Epn5KVSIBL5SlDdLsyQIO8d.jpg", "actors": ["Victor Rebengiuc (Pampon)", "Mariana Mihut (Mita Baston)", "Tora Vasilescu (Didina Mazu)", "Gheorghe Dinic\u0103 (Nae)", "Petre Gheorghiu (Cr\u0103c\u0103nel)", "Mircea Diaconu (Iordache)", "Stefan Iordache (Mitica)", "Florin Zamfirescu ()", "Stefan Banica ()", "Constantin Baltaretu ()", "Ion Anghel ()", "Jorj Voicu ()", "Alexandru Dragan ()", "Tamara Buciuceanu-Botez ()", "Aurel Giurumia ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
