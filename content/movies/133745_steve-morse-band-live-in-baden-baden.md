He has received many Grammy nominations, both for his work with the Dregs and as a solo artist. He has worked with dozens of famous guitarists of various musical genres, and been a member of the Dregs, Kansas, Living Loud, and (of course) Deep Purple.  These performances come from 1990, a few years before he joined Deep Purple, when he was touring with the Steve Morse Band, a trio that included bassist extraordinaire Dave LaRue, and drummer Van Romaine. The DVD features two concerts culled from the vaults of the German television program Ohne Filter Show.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6RbYgI65YuwXmceWxcQMO0Lz0za.jpg", "actors": ["Steve Morse (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
