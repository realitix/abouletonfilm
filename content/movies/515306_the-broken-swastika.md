This film opens when Ann\u2019s swastika necklace arrives back from the jewelers. Next we see Jim and Ann spoon at a beach party, until a jealous tiff causes her to walk off into the arms of a car-owning Lothario. On a nearby heath, Ann escapes from her randy driver and walks off alone. Next day, Jim, learning that Ann is missing, grabs his pistol. On the heath, he finds Ann's swastika on the ground and sees her bound and gagged by gypsies. They get their comeuppance and Jim gets his Ann. Robert G Torrens, the producer, makes a cameo appearance as a gypsy kidnapper in the latter part of this film.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
