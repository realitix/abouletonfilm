Enjoy 40 photographs that display and change every 30 seconds, while listening to relaxing cinema/classical music. If you have toddlers, this would be a great way to play the \"What color is that tulip?\" game. If you're studying, need something to play in the background before a bridal shower, or just want something soothing to watch before you go to sleep, this may be what you're looking for. This video is a great way to wind down little ones before bedtime. Enjoy!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
