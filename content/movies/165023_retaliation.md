Emerging from a stint in prison, yakuza lieutenant Sumukawa (Kobayashi) discovers that his gang has disintegrated while he was in the pen. An ambitious type, he quickly hooks up with another gang (led by Shishido) who promise him a prominent position if he helps them deal with a rival family. But bonds are made to be broken, and pledges of loyalty soon give way to competition, betrayal and \u2014 naturally \u2014 retaliation. Tough, cynical and violent, Retaliation cheerfully overturns romanticized notions of underworld honour, paving the way for Fukusaku's revisionist yakuza pictures of the 1970s.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/288WG0yt7Plj6xVDcsZSW4iValo.jpg", "actors": ["Akira Kobayashi (Kojiro Samukawa)", "J\u00f4 Shishido (Hino)", "Tamio Kawachi (Naruse)", "Tatsuya Fuji (Shinjo)", "Hideaki Nitani (Hakozaki)", "Eiji G\u00f4 (Nakatsu)", "Jir\u00f4 Okazaki (George)", "Meiko Kaji (Saeko)", "Sh\u00f4ki Fukae (Munezuka)", "Ry\u00f4ji Hayama (Kitakata)", "Kaku Takashina (Oribe)", "Jotaro Togami (Tokuji Hazama)", "Keisuke Noro ()", "Bumon Kahara ()", "Hiroshi Ch\u00f4 ()", "Nobuo Kawakami ()", "Saburo Hiromatsu ()", "Keisuke Yukioka ()", "Kiyoshi Kamoda ()", "Sonosuke Niki ()", "Shinz\u00f4 Shibata ()", "Shir\u00f4 \u00d4hama ()", "Iwae Arai ()", "Hiroshi K\u00f4no ()", "Satoko Sato ()", "Tomoko Aki ()", "Akira Takahashi ()", "Y\u00fbz\u00f4 Harumi ()", "Kokan Katsura ()", "Jiro Hiratsuka ()", "Mitsuru Sawa ()", "Tessen Nakahira ()", "Kuniya Mizukawa ()", "Ken Mizoguchi ()", "Masahiro Yafuji ()", "Tadayuki Kitagami ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
