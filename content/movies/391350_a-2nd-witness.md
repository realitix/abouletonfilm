She heard about the blessing Wilford Woodruff gave her mother, promising that she and her children would reach their destination and experience the Lord's providential hand on more than one occasion.  But Jane was only an infant when they made their harrowing journey and is beginning to doubt her mother's fantastic stories -- until she receives a miracle of her own.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/etrlSbuXc9g8C9j3QQlXj7fkwdj.jpg", "actors": ["Emily Wadley (Elizabeth Panting)", "Adrienne Carr (Jane Panting)", "Peggy Matheson (Adult Jane Panting)", "Antonio Lexerot (Frederick Panting)", "Catherine Cook (Jane's Daughter)", "Mark Gollaher (Wilford Woodruff)", "Jasen Wade (Levi Savage)", "Bruce Newbold (The Traveler)", "Bernie Diamond (Speaker)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
