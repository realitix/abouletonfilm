In all three pieces \u2013 Littoral Zones, Landfall, and Habitat \u2013 Ratt\u00e9 uses her signature modulator technique to intricately layer a series of moir\u00e9s and checkerboards that bring depth to the otherwise flat surface of the video screen. Where others create depth through recording or simulating hallways and tunnels, Ratt\u00e9 bends the signal of the video itself to carve out corridors of an undetermined distance.\"  - Nicholas O'Brien", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eKNeV7dmjzMEV4G8HLMn6Qa5A0L.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
