But a livelier agenda is established with \"Let the Good Times Roll,\" and the program expands to include pop, blues, Broadway, spirituals, and even a touch of patriotism in \"America the Beautiful.\" Cook has the biggest show-stopper: Cab Calloway's \"Minnie the Moocher.\" --Joe McLellan", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
