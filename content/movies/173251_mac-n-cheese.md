This roughly two minute animation took about five months to make, and about a bajillion peanut butter sandwiches.  Synopsis: When you find yourself running scared and running out of energy, there's only a few options left to outrun your opponent through the southern desert. Stopping at nothing, watch these two guys wear each other out and rip through boundaries hitherto unbroken.
