This of course can mean nothing but trouble for Joel. Before you can say \"I just failed Algebra,\" Lana and Joel are back in business, and the news is spreading fast. The whole campus wants what Joel is selling, and are willing to pay for it, big time. Lana and her girls (Alektra Blue, Asa Akira, Misty Stone, and a host of other beauties) are more than happy to give the student body a taste of their \"private tutoring\" sessions. Joel is having the time of his life, or so he thinks, but he quickly learns that all good things cum to an end.
