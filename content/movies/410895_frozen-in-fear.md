The uncensored version is much more steamy and loaded with nudity in generous amounts. The serial killer theme was interesting. Too bad he was damaged goods because his father messed him up so badly. I don't know how others feel but I really liked this one. It was bold, daring, and a little more over the top than Stephen King was. The art store owner from Seattle was a nice touch. Small towns make good settings for places where a weirdo might thrive in silence, unnoticed. I especially like how the build-up started with a quaint, friendly town and rose to a crescendo as you peeled back the layers from the local town folk. Could you fall for a killer? This movie is better than people say it is."}], "recommandations_id": []}
