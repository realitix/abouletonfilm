They encounter Sylvester and chase him into a junkyard, where a black panther that escaped from a zoo just happens to be hiding out. Every time Spike goes into the junkyard to thrash Sylvester, he is clawed into pieces by the panther, which he, in a dark maze of crates, thinks is Sylvester. Chester has no problem pummelling Sylvester before Spike's eyes, which convinces Spike that Chester must be tougher than him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qZoMvWrqY8YP0x7mHzZlMh2DlBA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [40865, 204677], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
