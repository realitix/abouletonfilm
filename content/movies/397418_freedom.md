{"tmdb_id": 397418, "title": "Freedom", "original_title": "Freedom", "slug_title": "freedom", "date": "1957-08-15", "genre": ["Drame"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "Freedom, Nigeria's contribution to the 1957 Berlin Film Festival, was based on a play commissioned by the Moral Re-Armament Association. Based on a stage piece, the film is an unabashed paean to the MRA, demonstrating how the organization helped to check British colonialism and radical insurrection in Nigeria and bring peace to the troubled country. Subtlety is not the film's strong suit, and as a result the film seems at times to be a self-parody. Reportedly the first African production to be lensed in color, Freedom benefits from the cinematographic expertise of Scandinavia's Richard Taegstrom and Aimo Jaederman. The film was enthusiastically received at the Berlin festival, but fared less well when released internationally.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bs7XJM2BnBcINtbJXqpSdiA91Ac.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
