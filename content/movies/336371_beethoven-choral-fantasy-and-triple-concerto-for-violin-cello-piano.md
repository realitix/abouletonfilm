The concerto is appealing in its melodic material and the intricate interactions among the soloists and orchestra. The Choral Fantasy features a long piano solo that Beethoven wrote for himself, plus a choral melody that sounds like a preliminary sketch for the last movement of his Ninth Symphony. Both works pose unusual balance challenges, to which Barenboim and the recording engineers rise impressively.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a6P9pIKBPPUsFR6rOdHdWpBW7om.jpg", "actors": ["Daniel Barenboim (Daniel Barenboim)", "Itzhak Perlman (Itzhak Perlman)", "Yo-Yo Ma (Yo-Yo Ma)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
