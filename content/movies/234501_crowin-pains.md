After being attacked by a little old lady (for trying to steal her popcorn), he flies to the country where he notices a farmer and his pet crow, Jubilee, the latter of which is well fed. Woody makes a deal with the crow (they'll trade places) and Jubilee heads to the city while Woody disguises himself as the crow. When Woody's disguise comes off, the farmer isn't impressed and plans to stuff and mount the bird. Woody manages to talk his way out of it and is free to go only to be clobbered by a vengeful returning Jubilee who also had eyes on the lady's popcorn!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iYyIZkZ45MIsdgy0N6Lx2v7wONI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
