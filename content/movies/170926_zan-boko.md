The space in which the placenta is buried is called 'Zan Boko' - a phrase which connotes the religious, cultural and affective relations that bind the child to the land and that embraces the notions of 'rootedness' and 'belonging'. Kabor\u00e9 tells the story of Tinga, who resists the encroaching urbanization of his native territory. The specific rhythms and vision of the rural community, including its values, social relationship, and individual & collective destinies, are altered when a city is planted on the edge of an ancient native village.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/doSwGYiDqoLoCnEomD7pT5PdjRL.jpg", "actors": ["Joseph Nikiema (Tinga)", "Gady Pafadnam (Tiraogo)", "Simone Tapsoba (Tiraogo's wife)", "Colette Kabor\u00e9 (Nopoko)", "Hippolyte Wangrawa (Gardener)", "Mathias Bayili ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [99329, 43004], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
