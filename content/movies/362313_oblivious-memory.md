Young Carlos faces the forgetfulness of old Carlos, who doesn't recognize his own appearance. They get a package. But the package seems odd. The knot that ties, the smell, the handwriting on the envelope: this could only be sent by his father, Ernesto, who has been dead for many years. A father who always created unusual situations. In this time warp, Carlos is split in two: one Carlos remembers and the other forgets the moments he spent with his father.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cUe78tCYn26SJKvSSSopXMNz2XV.jpg", "actors": ["Jo\u00e3o Miguel ()", "Tony Ramos ()", "Mariana Ximenes ()", "Charles Fricks ()", "Fl\u00e1vio Bauraqui ()", "Ant\u00f4nio Pedro ()", "C\u00e2ndido Damm ()", "In\u00eas Peixoto (M\u00e3e de Maria)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
