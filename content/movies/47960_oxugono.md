The families apparently normal, bourgeois, every-day life will crack open, bringing to the surface hatred and passions of the kind that lie well-hidden in the mists of the nearby lake. An intense plot and a totally unexpected ending make up this film, which features characters who are vulnerable, innocent and ordinary, but who become ruthless and callous, worrying only about protecting their financial resources. The offences are disproportionately serious compared to the financial benefits they try to secure", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yJ5gMTxatLp50RzT2xx1qWjGdb7.jpg", "actors": ["Nena Menti (Magda)", "Maria Kavoyianni (Vicky)", "Akilas Karazisis (Giorgos)", "Joys Evidi (Gia)", "Alexis Georgoulis (Stelios Nousias)", "Jeannie Papadopoulou (Giota)", "Yiannis Tsimitselis (Hristos)", "Alexandros Antonopoulos (Manolis)", "Anna Kyriakou (Anneta)", "Giorgos Gerontidakis-Sempetadelis (Timos)", "Jenny Theona (Fay)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [387029, 173385, 383458, 392547], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
