The Black Angel is a transitional film; on one hand, it is a companion piece to Willow Springs, featuring two Schroeter regulars as characters far from home and in extremis; on the other hand, it is a film essay about Mexico and as such a harbinger of Schroeter\u2019s nonfiction work to come. While he clearly shares his characters\u2019 fascination with Mexico, the filmmaker also savages touristic exoticism \u2013 the otherworldly appearances of his protagonists and their rapturous reactions to new surroundings contrast sharply with the sober perceptions of Mexican history and economics featured in the documentary segments and in the prosaic presence of a non-professional cast of locals. - Harvard Film Archive", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kWueJYK0n6N7GFZppw2Gy6hrABs.jpg", "actors": ["Carlos De Muna ()", "Magdalena Montezuma ()", "Ellen Umlauf ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
