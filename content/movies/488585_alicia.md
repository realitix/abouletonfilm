{"tmdb_id": 488585, "title": "Alicia", "original_title": "Alicia", "slug_title": "alicia", "date": "2017-11-15", "genre": ["Documentaire / Documentaire"], "score": "8.0/10", "synopsis": "\"It\u2019s not easy to find a foster family for you,\" an orphanage supervisor explains to nine-year-old Alicia. \"After all, you are a very special girl.\" Alicia is crying. \"I\u2019m not special. I\u2019m just a girl.\" This disturbing scene sets the tone for this film about Alicia, who was taken away from her teenage mother by the Child Welfare Bureau when she was 12 months old. She\u2019s been living in an orphanage since the age of five, and they have never managed to find a foster family for her. In Alicia, we watch as she becomes a teenager, still craving safety and love. Over the course of three years, filmmaker Maasja Ooms follows her daily life up close. Alicia's yearning and powerlessness are palpable in these observations, which painfully reveal the effects of having no prospects.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nNtQz2fLNQAofcBUKK566xitaYP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
