First, the camera pans the Kremlin and Marshal's Bridge. Sleds are parked in rows. Horse-drawn sleighs run up and down a busy street. Next, we visit the mushroom and fish market where common people work and shop. In Petrovsky Park are the well-to-do. Men are in great coats. A file of six or seven women ski past on a narrow lane. Last, there's a general view of Moscow. A slow pan takes us to a view above the river front where the film began.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8JH9vwuqsOMB71ejAiyRRbQlGuf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [189587, 214952, 148168, 98914], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
