The city assigns one of its best detectives, Yan Gao to find \"the Wise One,\" the crime lord behind the murders. To do this, Yan sets up a series of surveillance sights around the city. When port guard Ye learns that he and his supervisor have been chosen to monitor one of the Wise One's main hideouts, he is delighted. It is the most exciting thing to have happened to him in years. But problems come because he must work nights and is sworn to secrecy. His girlfriend Bai Lin misinterprets his absences and this causes trouble. More trouble comes when her old lover shows up. Matters are made worse when a message for Ye and Tian to stop their surveillance does not get through.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1W2QCqkYIDEN0fqVhHClevvuEy1.jpg", "actors": ["Feng Gong (Ye Minzhu)", "Jiang Shan (Bai Lin)", "Ten Rujun (Tian Gongshun (as Rujun Teng))", "Zhang Xiaotong (Yang Gao)", "Zhenhua Niu (\u72af\u7f6a\u56e2\u4f19\u4e2d\u7684\u5934\u76ee\u201c\u667a\u8005\u201d)", "Zhang Jiayi (\u91cd\u6848\u7ec4\u6768\u9ad8)", "Chen Hao ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
