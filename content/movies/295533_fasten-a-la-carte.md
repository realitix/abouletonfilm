Hoping for a speedy recovery, Gilles moves into a fasting hotel on the island of Sylt for a while, recommended to him by his friend Risto. The isolation and peace, combined with doing without solid food is supposed to sharpen his senses and help them return completely. On the island, he not only experiences a turbulent reunion with fasting instructor Marit Hansen - but his desirous ex-lover Diana moves into the adjacent room as well.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vuSz2TAuflnDgg4AP36gf3zEUQk.jpg", "actors": ["Dietmar B\u00e4r (Gilles Demmonget)", "Maxim Mehmet (Paul Scheffke)", "Inka Friedrich (Marit Hansen)", "Martin Brambach (Zimmermann)", "Hannes Hellmann (Wolf Heine)", "Maria Ketikidou (Valerie)", "Catrin Striebeck (Risto)", "Stephan Schad (Risto)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
