As he travels, he writes letters back to those new congregations, and they become so important that those letters make up the next books in the Bible. In Letters from Paul! [Romans through Philemon], we learn about all 13 of Paul\u2019s letters and the important messages they contain for Jesus\u2019 followers. It isn\u2019t easy being a Christian at this time, and Paul\u2019s encouragement to the early church continues to prove helpful for us today. Through these little letters, we also learn some big concepts like justification, sanctification, grace, faith and the fruit of the Spirit.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bWVaTQNUlD7myc47I0FcYdHmIaB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
