Therefore, Jochen and Gerd are shocked when they meet two young ladies during their well-deserved holiday who are already dressed in two of the new pieces. And as if that was not enough, they pass the creations off as their own, even though they are employed at the competing company \"Berolina\". Naturally, the two men refuse to let the matter rest, although they do not actually want to raise a quarrel with the pretty ladies. After some turbulent entanglements they become aware of the foolishness of their squabbling and, eventually, the four of them present the disputed designs as a co-production at the fashion fair in Leipzig.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aT2DWKjb0DHxsQODYPI8rdUdnMk.jpg", "actors": ["Gerda Falk (Ursel Altmann)", "Margit Schaum\u00e4ker (Hilde Mei\u00dfner)", "Fritz Wagner (Gerd Neumann)", "Siegfried Dornbusch (Jochen Rauhut)", "Werner Peters (Hans Obermann)", "Edith Hancke (Jungarbeiterin Inge Lang)", "Karl Hellmer ()", "Herbert Kiper ()", "Trude Lehmann ()", "Hans Neie ()", "Friedel Nowack ()", "Peter Dornseif ()", "Carola Braunbock ()", "Albert Venohr ()", "Elfie Dugall ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
