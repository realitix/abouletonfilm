In this whirling, hypnotic world, dozens of tiny gymnasts leap, somersault and twist through the air. Their spirited acrobatics trigger both narrative and musical sequences that are mesmerizing and, at times, dizzying. Half-figurative and half-abstract, The Clockmakers is a playful creation that is sure to captivate and dazzle its audience.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7kb8dLYc6LAPIoxL1t2Zoiqb9ux.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
