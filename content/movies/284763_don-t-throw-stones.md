Rising to fame as frontman of \u201870s legends The Sports, he has spent more than 30 years at the forefront of the local music scene, forging a reputation both as one of Australian rock's greatest lyrical storytellers and also one of its most incendiary critics. Based on his scathing tell-all memoir Will It Be Funny Tomorrow, Billy?, Don't Throw Stones tells Cummings' story in his own words \u2013 as well as the words of those he has so gleefully skewered. Featuring interviews with Michael Gudinski, Steve Kilbey, Joe Camilleri and many more, Don't Throw Stones is a revealing portrait of three decades of rock-world gossip, larger-than-life personalities and good, old-fashioned artistic beef.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3njwzpAiXy92aGVtXl11GNFTC3O.jpg", "actors": ["Stephen Cummings (Himself)", "Michael Gudinski (Himself)", "Joe Camilleri (Himself)", "Steve Kilbey (Himself)", "Martin Armiger (Himself)", "Rebecca Barnard (Herself)", "Andrew Pendlebury (Himself)", "Shane O'Mara (Himself)", "Dave Robinson (Himself)", "Jen Jewel Brown (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "FkN8cpkoEos"}
