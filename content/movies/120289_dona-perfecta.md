Liberal farmer Pepe has arrived in Santa Fe to visit his aunt, Dona Perfecta. While he's there, Pepe is eager to teach the traditional-minded townspeople a new way of living. Unfortunately for Pepe the people of Santa Fe aren't eager to embrace change, and when the citizens begin to voice resentment Pepe is forced to seek refuge with his sympathetic aunt. Dona Perfecta is just as traditional as any of the other townspeople though, and only suffers Pepe due to the fact that he is family. When Pepe and his cousin Rosario fall deeply in love, the situation quickly comes to a head.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oiTEXjcBlHWVlrxl7D3CfNkEmUM.jpg", "actors": ["Dolores del R\u00edo (Do\u00f1a Perfecta)", "Esther Fern\u00e1ndez (Rosario)", "Carlos Navarro (Pepe Rey)", "Julio Villarreal (Don Inocencio)", "Jos\u00e9 El\u00edas Moreno (Crist\u00f3bal Ramos)", "Natalia Ortiz (Do\u00f1a Remedios)", "Ignacio Retes (Jacintito)", "Rafael Icardo (Don Cayetano)", "Manuel Arvide (Capit\u00e1n)", "Mar\u00eda Gentil Arcos (Librada)", "Bruno M\u00e1rquez (Jos\u00e9 Juan Arciniega)", "Salvador Quiroz (Pedro el Juez)", "Daniel Arroyo (Invitado a cena (uncredited))", "Augusto Benedico (Don Anselmo (uncredited))", "Ram\u00f3n Bugarini (Soldado (uncredited))", "Jos\u00e9 Ch\u00e1vez (Soldado (uncredited))", "Enedina D\u00edaz de Le\u00f3n (Guadalupe (uncredited))", "Jos\u00e9 Escanero (Pueblerino (uncredited))", "Cecilia Leger (Beata (uncredited))", "Carmen Manzano (Amparo (uncredited))", "H\u00e9ctor Mateos (Don Abraham (uncredited))", "Diana Ochoa (Inesita (uncredited))", "Hilda Vera ((uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
