She sounds like part Bonnie Raitt, part Janis Joplin, part Aretha Franklin, yet she can belt out a song without losing control in a way that gives her an edge that no other singer can compare to. Add to her vocal prowess, her guitar slinger skills and you have a rare combination in a contemporary female performer. Recorded in 2003, Tedeschi\u2019s performance is the essence of what Austin City Limits is all about, drawing from the best of blues, rock, soul and funk. But what she does best comes from deep within her heart and soul.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sI0Jo0B2vsXvlwEAXKnePKZ60Pe.jpg", "actors": ["Susan Tedeschi (Herself (lead vocalist, guitarist))", "Jason Crosby (Himself (keyboardist, violinist, backing vocalist))", "William Green (Himself (organist, backing vocalist))", "Ron Perry (Himself (bassist, backing vocalist))", "Jeff Sipe (Himself (drummer, vocalist))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
