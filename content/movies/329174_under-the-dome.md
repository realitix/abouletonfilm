Chai Jing started making the documentary when her as yet unborn daughter developed a tumour in the womb, which had to be removed very soon after her birth. Chai blames air pollution for the tumour. The film, which combines footage of a lecture with interviews and factory visits, has been compared with Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth in both its style and likely impact. The film openly criticises state-owned energy companies, steel producers and coal factories, as well as showing the inability of the Ministry of Environmental Protection to act against the big polluters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hVEVL7y6ia4MaH2Q9d7MpgLVR78.jpg", "actors": ["Chai Jing (herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "T6X2uwlQGQM"}
