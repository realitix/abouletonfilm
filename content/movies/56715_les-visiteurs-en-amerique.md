Aussit\u00f4t victime d'hallucinations, il tue accidentellement sa bien-aim\u00e9e. Un geste irr\u00e9versible qui lui vaut la peine de mort. Le duc Thibault est toutefois sauv\u00e9 par son fid\u00e8le serviteur, Andr\u00e9 le P\u00e2t\u00e9, et le magicien anglais. Celui-ci leur pr\u00e9pare un breuvage qui leur permettra de remonter le temps et ainsi de pouvoir emp\u00eacher la mort de Rosaline.

Somehow I found this, and after some research I chose this version to watch which I thought easy to understand, as well as for the reason some updates were made in this. Well, I know nothing can beat the original, but for those haven't seen the original, this is not a bad one. Quite an enjoyable film with a simple theme and a simple adventure.\r\n\r\nSeems a very familiar concept, but surely a unique product. Jean Reno was brilliant and so his sidekick and other supporting characters. Top notch jokes, felt like I had some loud laughs after a long time. Of course, there are some flaws, but minors, like relocating from Europe to the US since it is a Hollywood production. It is a time travel theme in fantasy. There's no time machine, instead a wizard behind the adventure through the time.\r\n\r\nA perfect family film. It's not about prediction, since watching the first scene you would know what follows it and how it all ends. So you're relieved from guessing stuff and can sit back relaxedly and enjoy it as much you can. It is your average film, but if you're seeking a good comedy, then it is surely above that. There are thousands of masterpiece comedies, this is not one of them, though must see from this genre.\r\n\r\n7/10"}], "recommandations_id": [10353, 11687, 248705, 39386], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
