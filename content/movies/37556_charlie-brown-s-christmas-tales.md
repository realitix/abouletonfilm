Snoopy works as a bell-ringer to raise money and tries making peace with the ferocious cat next door. Linus strives to strike the right tone in his letter to Santa - and his friendship with an indecisive girl at school. Sally's idea about gift giving and the identity of Santa may be unusual - but her strange notion about how to obtain a Christmas tree surprisingly does the job. Lucy tries awfully hard to be nice...and still coax everyone around her to buy her presents. Charlie Brown and Sally wait up for Santa (a surprisingly short man), who spreads Christmas gift cheer further than they had thought. Make merry!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bpe5PcAJdbq53PzrbjtDObUkumA.jpg", "actors": ["Wesley Singerman (Charlie Brown)", "Serena Berman (Lucy Van Pelt)", "Corey Padnos (Linus Van Pelt)", "Megan Taylor Harvey (Sally Brown)", "Christopher Johnson (Schroeder)", "Lauren Schaffel (Jezebel / Lydia)", "Bill Melendez (Snoopy / Woodstock)", "Timmy Deters (Rerun Van Pelt (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [55444], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
