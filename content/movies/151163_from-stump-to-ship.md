For more than 150 years, logging techniques remained the same. Men cut trees by hand and loaded them on horse-drawn sleds to be hauled over snow to the river. Skilled river drivers maneuvered the logs downstream, risking their limbs and lives every day. This film survives as a record of the long log business.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2yX3BXLXB2eTcOH3ShumMTfRvsD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
