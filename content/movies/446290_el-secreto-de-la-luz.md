Blomberg explored Ecuador as few others have done and created this vast and exciting work. He arrived in 1934 to study the Galapagos Islands and returned many times to film, write and photograph the natives and the fishermen, the cities and the rainforest. This film explores the explorer through his work. Developed exclusively based on the enormous visual legacy of Blomberg, we travel to a different time and find a view that, despite the passage of time, remains intact. Today, viewing his work, we see how the entire self-identity of the country might have been very different.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gwRnyPnuu585PAHK9PhE8H6VY3N.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
