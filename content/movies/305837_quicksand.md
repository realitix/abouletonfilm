He and his father make up a strong team. In the literal and figurative sense, because his father not only teaches him to milk the cows and hunt, he is also the coach of his soccer team. The happy tide turns when the boy turns eighteen and is scouted as a promising soccer talent. Suddenly, Frits's future is no longer with his father on the farm, but on the green grass of the Nijmegen soccer club NEC. His son's splendid soccer career may be the crowning glory of the farmer's hard work, but he is afraid he will also lose his only child. Desperate, he reveals the lie with which he raised his son. Frits is bewildered and makes a dramatic decision.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Johnny de Mol ()", "Dimme Treurniet ()", "Nienke R\u00f6mer ()", "Celia Nufaar ()", "Helmert Woudenberg ()", "Micha Hulshof ()", "Titus Muizelaar ()", "Angelique de Bruijne ()", "Els Ingeborg Smits ()", "Ren\u00e9 van Asten ()", "Hein van der Heijden ()", "Martijn Fischer ()", "Michiel Varga ()", "Juul Vrijdag ()", "Aat Ceelen ()", "Lieuwe Rodnoer ()", "Touriya Haoud ()", "Hans Trentelman ()", "Jack van Gelder ()", "Toine van Peperstraten ()", "Pieter Jan Hagens ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
