You'll start out learning chords and strumming patterns so you can sing and play along. The songs are demonstrated slowly, phrase by phrase with split screen close-ups so you can see exactly how to play them. Then you'll learn how to add the melody to your chord strums to create lead solo arrangements for a variety of familiar songs. By the time you're finished, you'll learn hammer-ons, pull-offs, slides, tablature, rhythm patterns, arpeggiated rhythm, endings, and more.  Bass and rhythm guitar accompaniment is provided for songs at normal speed and at a slower speed so you can play along. A handy case size booklet is included with exact transcriptions of songs and playing techniques in tablature.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iliqbWdLCPeBUEYehp3yDwB30SW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
