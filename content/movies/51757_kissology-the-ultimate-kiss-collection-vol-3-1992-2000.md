Volume three is mostly comprised of live material, with five full-length concerts included. One of these shows is a real treat for collectors, as it dates back to 1973, and is the first time the band was ever captured playing in full make-up. Also featured is an appearance on MTV's popular UNPLUGGED show from 1995, which saw the original line-up of the band performing together for the first time since 1979. With a total run time approaching 10 hours, this collection should keep Kiss fanatics more than happy until the next volume in the series arrives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rM3g1WqPe5xlUBmZZB5rnO5cAZB.jpg", "actors": ["Gene Simmons ()", "Paul Stanley ()", "Peter Criss ()", "Paul Daniel Frehley ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
