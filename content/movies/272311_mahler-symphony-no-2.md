Boulez went on to conduct a performance of Mahler's \"Resurrection\" Symphony with the Berlin Staatskapelle and the Berlin State Opera Chorus and later that same evening he performed a work of his own with his Ensemble InterContemporain.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
