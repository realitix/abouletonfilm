He created the Moon C.R.A.T.E.R. Project, the wackiest intergalactic sports circuit, where two opposing Robot armies battle it out to settle Earth's disputes using the deadliest weapon known: water!  Bolts and Blip, Central City's misfits, are accidently recruited as members of the Lunar Leagues last placed team - The Thunderbolts! They find themselves catapulted into a series of hilarious lunar battles and soon discover that all is not what it seems.  In the next instalment of BOLTS &amp; BLIP, the Thunderbolts fall under the spell of a mysterious \"Black Box\", a strange invader crash lands on the moon and threatens to destroy Lunar City and Saedee finds herself replaced as team captain, by a mysterious prototype \"Saedee-34\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/laBiLAtxoCH2ojUE9t825olvZsz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
