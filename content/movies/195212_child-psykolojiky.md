Pappy wants to smack the tot, but Popeye persuades him to try psychology instead. Popeye tells the story of how \"George Washlincoln\" chopped down the cherry tree. Inspired, Swee'Pea chops a hole in the floor, then tells the truth. Popeye rushes out to buy him a reward, leaving Pappy in charge, but Pappy believes in a rather dangerous style of parenting, introducing him to William Tell (from both ends of the gun). Pappy lies about it to Popeye.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yOIcQcsQpklLnGDCRSWB1YYDjmX.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Mercer (Popeye / Pappy (voice))", "Margie Hines (Swee'pea (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
