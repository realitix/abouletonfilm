One evening he\u2019s sitting down in a lavishly appointed private room to enjoy an elaborate multicourse dinner, when he gets a call from a crooked politician of his acquaintance. A long-meditated money-laundering deal is about to bear fruit and earn him a cool 5 billion yen. The gang boss who backed him on this deal will be pleased.  He is, understandably, in the mood for celebrating when an unexpected visitor (Izam) arrives \u2014 a tall, husky, mincing fellow in dreadlocks, with a gun. He is a hit man sent to whack Hoshino \u2014 but for what? The hit man neither explains nor kills; instead he sits down at the table and asks Hoshino when dinner is going to be served. Coolly, Hoshino calls in Chinese for the waitress, who enters, wearing a red, slit dress and an inscrutable expression, with the first course. The longest meal of Hoshino\u2019s life has just begun.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uAAU32TJEcW9eyNq4xqKuEY0Zj4.jpg", "actors": ["Toshir\u014d Yanagiba ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
