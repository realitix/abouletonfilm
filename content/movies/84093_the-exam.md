The state, shaken and insecure by the defeated revolution of 1956 and prodded by a renewed Stalinist atmosphere, has decreed that all security personnel must take an exam to challenge and verify their loyalty. But to be effective in this shadowy world of suspicion and lies, of secrets within secrets, where nothing and no one can be trusted, the subjects must be unaware they are being tested.  Focused on the secret machinations of a totalitarian state\u2019s paranoid need for absolute control, The Exam is a fascinating, Kafka-esque portrait of an era gone by \u2013 but it\u2019s a mindset still very much active today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l0GI278rhbhYppmMojudXgu4D1h.jpg", "actors": ["Zsolt Nagy (Andr\u00e1s Jung)", "J\u00e1nos Kulka (P\u00e1l Mark\u00f3)", "P\u00e9ter Scherer (Emil Kulcs\u00e1r)", "Andr\u00e1s Balogh (Doh\u00e1ny)", "Gabriella H\u00e1mori (\u00c9va G\u00e1t)", "Haumann P\u00e9ter (Rozgonyi)", "Ferenc Elek (Csap\u00f3)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
