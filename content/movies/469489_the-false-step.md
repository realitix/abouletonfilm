Inexplicably, Elisa flees the scene of the accident, stops a passing driver and tells him a made-up story about a stolen car, concealing her husband's death. Feeling sorry for the girl, the driver, Philippe Mor\u00e7ot, gives her a lift and later lets her stay at his house. The good deed, however, doesn't go unpunished, and soon Philippe is drawn into Elisa's twilight world of fantasies, lies and paranoia.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4Y9xYrdk9UmbN1Woce1YEcPzKvG.jpg", "actors": ["Dominique Paturel (Philippe Mor\u00e7ot)", "Yori Bertin (Elisa Langerot)", "Jean-Claude Pascal (Robert Langerot)", "Florence Vainer (La fianc\u00e9e de Philippe)", "Martial R\u00e8be (Le domestique)", "Pierre Marty ()", "Laurence Thielen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
