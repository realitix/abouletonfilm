Cinematography is by Russell Metty. It stars Lex Barker, Mara Corday, Stephen McNally and John Dehner.\r\n\r\nJeff Carr (Barker) is a special investigator who arrives in Tomahawk to seek out who has been holding up the local stagecoach with murderous intent.\r\n\r\nIt's your standard rank and file \"B\" Oater of the 1950s, but one of worth to the discerning duster fanatic. Beautifully photographed by Metty out of Conejo Valley and Skeleton Canyon - in Eastman Color (check out those blues) - the pic never lacks for action (dynamite play, shoot-ups, rounds of knuckles) and mysterious political intrigue.\r\n\r\nCharacterisations are boosted by the presence of McNally and Dehner (as usual), and Corday is socko beautiful enough to off-set what is - and was - often a standard Western female role. There's some neat touches in the screenplay, such as a black sheep metaphor, the fact our hero quite often is easily disarmed! And some good old false imprisonment.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't shake your boots off but it does ruffle them regardless. Good fun. 6.5/10"}], "recommandations_id": [213668, 121713, 167788, 121161]}
