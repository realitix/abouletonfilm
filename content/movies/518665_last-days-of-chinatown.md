Long known as a center of drugs and prostitution, and also once home to a thriving Chinese enclave, it\u2019s now peppered with boutique shops, new bars and restaurants and the just-debuted Little Caesars Arena. This feature from noted Detroit artist Nicole Macdonald mixes a personal, journalistic and historic approach as it looks at who and what remains in the Corridor. We hear how residents survived, and how they sometimes didn't, as gentrification redefines the space.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7eMD3Ib8Xm5z4YVhyqaQjXowuRc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
