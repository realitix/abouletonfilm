Freshly deceased, he is flown to the United States where Dr. Trenton transplants his brain into the body of a simpleton in a classic \"assistant got the wrong kind of body\" plot line. Dr. Trenton has a few nefarious plot twists of his own in mind, and then there's the thing with the dwarf and the women chained in the basement.
