And despite negotiations between Japan and the U. S. A. war is declared with the attack on Pearl Harbour. Victories follow for Japan on land and sea and her forces push forward to the borders of India. But gradually the tide turns in favour of the Allies and after the atom bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan is compelled to accept the Potsdam Declaration and by the order of the Emperor agrees to unconditional surrender. Under the supervision of the occupation forces the International Military Tribunal opens in Tokyo to try the Japanese war leaders. Established in the cause of justice, and to prevent future aggressive wars the trials drag on for two and a half years. And on December 23, 1948, General Tojo and six other war leaders mount the thirteen steps to the gallows at Tokyo's Sugamo prison.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5cbMhMT6awIYoKly4YMVHyuSKjK.jpg", "actors": ["Kanj\u00fbr\u00f4 Arashi (Hideki Tojo)", "Minoru Takada (Prime Minister Konoe)", "Masao Shimizu (K\u014dki Hirota)", "Hiroshi Hayashi (Foreign Affairs Minister Togo)", "Joji Oka (War Minister Anami)", "J\u014dji Ohara (Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan Kido)", "Toshio Hosokawa (Ambassador Kurusu)", "Toshiaki Konoe (Ambassador Nomura)", "Ichir\u00f4 Ry\u00fbzaki (Admiral Yamamoto)", "K\u00f4tar\u00f4 Band\u00f4 (Admiral Yonai)", "Takamaru Sasaki (Counsel Kiyose)", "Ureo Egawa (Counsel Shimazu)", "Y\u00f4ichi Numata (Counsel Hayashi)", "Shinsuke Mikimoto ()", "Eijiro Sakauchi (Chief Defense Counsel Uzawa)", "Shin Takemura ()", "Arata Shibata (Sadao Araki)", "Hyo Kitazawa (Shumei Okawa)", "Akira Nakamura (Priest Hanayama)", "J\u00fbzabur\u00f4 Akechi (Lieutenant Colonel Takeda)", "Masanori Takeda (Prime Minister Suzuki)", "Ky\u00f4ji Kokonoe (Admiral Shimada)", "Koji Hirose (Admiral Nagano)", "Takeo Matsushita (Admiral Sugiyama)", "Ryuji Wakamiya (Admiral Oikawa)", "Tomohiko \u00d4tani (Vice-Admiral Nagumo)", "Gen Funabashi (Vice-Admiral Ito)", "Jushiro Kobayashi (Vice-Admiral Yamashita)", "S\u00f4zabur\u00f4 Kikuchi (Captain of the Yamato)", "Shigeru Amachi (First Officer of the Yamato)", "Masao Takamatsu (Yamato Staff Officer)", "Den Kunikata (Yamato Staff Officer)", "Hiroshi Izumida (Yamato Staff Officer)", "Tadashi Ikezuki (Yamato Staff Officer)", "Jun \u00d4tomo ()", "Sh\u00f4zabur\u00f4 Date (Lieutenant Yamada)", "Tetsur\u014d Tamba ()", "Tsunemi Hirose (Seishiro Itagaki)", "Takashi Yamaguchi (Iwane Matsui)", "Eiichi Nobuo (Kenji Doihara)", "Hiroki Nakanishi (Akira Muto)", "S\u00f4ten Kuni (Heitaro Kimura)", "Nagamasa Yamada (General Umezu)", "Shusui Tsuda (Teiichi Suzuki)", "Sadao Horiuchi (Mamoru Shigemitsu)", "Takematsu Okuno (Shigeru Yoshida)", "Hiroshi Ayukawa (Hatakeyama)", "Shinji Arima (Patrolman Fujii)", "Yukio Kohama (Kakiuchi)", "T\u00f4ru Chiba (Secretary Omura)", "Hiroaki Kurahashi (Counselor Inoue)", "Minoru Asuka (Interpreter)", "Mamoru Katsuya (Emperor of Manchukuo)", "Isamu Eto (Ryukichi Tanaka)", "Sh\u00fbji Kawabe (Dr. Takikawa)", "Sanae Takasugi (Mrs. Tojo)", "Kinuko Obata (Tojo's older daughter)", "Ayame Hanazono (Tojo's younger daughter)", "Kimie Tokudaiji (Mrs. Hirota)", "Fumiko Miyata (Hirota's older daughter)", "Noriko Kitazawa (Hirota's younger daughter)", "Katsuko Wakasugi (Lady Konoe)", "Keinosuke Wada (Konoe's second son)", "Miyuki Takakura (Tokyo Rose)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
