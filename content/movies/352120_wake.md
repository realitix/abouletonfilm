This experimental film compares the vision of a \"promised land\" with the lived memory of migration and explores too, the misrepresentation of indigenous people during both these eras. The half-hour experimental film is a response to the death of the filmmaker's father, an event that ultimately led to her return to New Zealand after a decade in America.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/84ijqdw7wtpxQOKIXOfI1ioow36.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
