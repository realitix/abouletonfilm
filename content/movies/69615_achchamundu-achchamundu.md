He submerges himself in the office and eats sambhar rice at home and she never misses a bhajan at the temple and shops at Indian stores. They have a daughter Rithika (Akshaya Dinesh), 5 years old, the apple of their lives (their car's registration number carries the name of their daughter.) They have just settled down in a new, spacious home about which Malini, understandably, has fears. The couple squabble amicably about everything from her perpetual laundry and cooking; while Senthil argues with friends about the significance of viboothi (holy ash, usually applied on forehead) and takes his family on weekend trips and birthday parties. It is a normal, happy life in the US until Robertson (John Shea) arrives, to paint the basement. Now, things are never the same at home again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4CoYIkHztxF51l4kVedbjtaR0Co.jpg", "actors": ["Prasanna (Senthil Kumar)", "Sneha (Malini Kumar)", "John Shea (Theodore Robertson)", "Mark Stolzenberg (Clown)", "Andrea Harrison (Reporter Emily Barker)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
