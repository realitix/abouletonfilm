The film follows the filmmakers as they travel through eastern Slovakia to interview Warhol's surviving relatives, ethnic-Ruthenians living near the Polish border in Mikov\u00e1, and to visit the Andy Warhol Museum of Modern Art in Medzilaborce. The museum is shown to be in a poor state, with the museum director and staff openly soliciting donations from the viewer and giving out the museum's bank account details.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k7oP7P9mYJcbQMAek8ujxVkd5Im.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [36821, 67404], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
