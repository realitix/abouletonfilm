The libretto is comprised of passages from \"The Bhagavad-Gita,\" India's greatest philosophical epic, and perfectly complements Glass' ravishing score, mysteriously transporting the audience with a serene power and an all-encompassing sense of peace.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aXttttwb3UAZnxh8I1xAUCqmx0f.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
