The Reckoning follows dynamic ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo and his team for 3 years across 4 continents as he issues arrest warrants for Lord\u2019s Resistance Army leaders in Uganda, puts Congolese warlords on trial, shakes up the Colombian justice system, and charges Sudan\u2019s President Omar al-Bashir with genocide in Darfur, challenging the UN Security Council to arrest him. Building cases against genocidal criminals presents huge challenges, and the Prosecutor has a mandate but no police force. At every turn, he must pressure the international community to muster political will for the cause.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ut2hdOlxso7kZFvsOIWZr9RumvB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
