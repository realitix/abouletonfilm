It's a very simple and interesting theme, all about Kashmir where J&K and the Kashmiri people are central to certain developments taking place in the movie. In the recent past, Kashmir has been portrayed in many films for the unrest in the region, however in this film there is no violence and the movie depicts the beauty and chastity of Kashmir and Kashmiris. The film travels through lots of beautiful locations in Kashmir which have never been shown before. It's a soul searching journey for the characters where they meet different people undergoing their challenges in very difficult conditions and yet they are positive, hopeful and facing the harsh realities of life with a 'never say die' attitude.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bgFigU9FlJ34KnhMFBM1GFi1A4T.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Alter (Allan Alter)", "Aditi Bhatia ()", "Farida Jalal ()", "Shahbaz Khan ()", "Alok Nath ()", "Indraneil Sengupta ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "pvaCMLRE3dc"}
