The child is returned unharmed but then the same thing happens with a little girl, and then another. Each child attends a different nursery, and each parent contacts a different police station, so, at first, no connection is established between the incidents and the reports are filed and forgotten. Meanwhile DCI Winter is investigating a series of random attacks on strangely uncooperative university students, but when a a four-year-old boy is abducted and found injured, the forgotten files resurface and a link between the stories becomes apparent. As Gothenburg prepares for Christmas, Winter is in a race against time to prevent a horrific catastrophe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7ar1D1LWpBFtxYlvXuYDVBCPfpz.jpg", "actors": ["Johan Gry (Erik Winter)", "Krister Henriksson (Bertil Ringmar)", "Lennart J\u00e4hkel (Fredrik Halders)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
