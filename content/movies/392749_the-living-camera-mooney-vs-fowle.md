A high school football game, pitting Miami High against their rivals from Edison High. The title refers to the coaches of each, and the film follows them separately, with their real families and their clan of players, in the days leading up to the big event. And then at last it astonishingly chronicles the game from all kinds of angles you wouldn\u2019t expect from even the newly mobile tools of the Drew crew. Today\u2019s television coverage doesn\u2019t come nearly as close to capturing the spirit of the sport and its fans the way Lipscomb does here.
