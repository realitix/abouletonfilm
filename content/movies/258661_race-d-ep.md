The film traces the history of modern homosexuality through the twentieth century, from early sexology and the nudes of Baron von Gloeden to gay liberation and cruising on the streets of Paris. Influenced by the groundbreaking work of Michel Foucault on the history of sexuality and reflecting the revolutionary queer activism of its day, \"Race d\u2019Ep!\" is a shockingly frank, sex-filled experimental documentary about gay culture emerging from the shadows.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4kdmeosjHBq2z6wLOIZPfswncv5.jpg", "actors": ["Elizar Van Effenterre (Baron Von Gloeden)", "Gilles Sandier (Client 1)", "Pierre Hahn (Magnus Hirschfeld)", "Jean Demelier (Assistant de Hirschfeld)", "Yves Jacquemard (Assistant de Hirschfeld)", "Jean-Michel S\u00e9n\u00e9cal (Assistant de Hirschfeld)", "Claire Amiard (Une secr\u00e9taire)", "Adeline Andr\u00e9 (Une secr\u00e9taire)", "Michel Journiac (Un SS)", "Piotr Stanislas (Un SS / L'Am\u00e9ricain (as Piotr))", "Hunks Clements (Le joli blond)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
