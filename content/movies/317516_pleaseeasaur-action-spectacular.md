J.P. Hasson's surreal shows mix synthesized tunes, hilarious lyrics and costumes more outrageous than anything Elton John wore in the 1970s. With songs such as \"Beef Flavored Island\" and \"Droid County\" and a singer switching from a furry yeti costume to a silver spaceman suit, you can bet there's never a dull moment in this live show.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
