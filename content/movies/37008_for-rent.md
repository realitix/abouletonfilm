He has no money, job, girlfriend, friends or life plan. He's a composer that doesn't compose. The one-time \"most likely to succeed\" at Santiago's Musical Conservatory has passed from promise to failure. He feels he is beginning to wander alone. Isolated and detached. Gast\u00f3n feels that everyone judges him and see the word loser tattooed on his forehead. At the same time, an alter-ego, a sort of doppelg\u00e4nger, haunts him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eHr6ym1gPt9FEotPoU05j621IhH.jpg", "actors": ["Luciano Cruz-Coke (Gast\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez)", "Felipe Braun (Juli\u00e1n Balbo)", "Francisca Lewin (Elisa)", "Benjam\u00edn Vicu\u00f1a (Paul Kaz\u00e1n)", "Javiera D\u00edaz de Vald\u00e9s (Catalina)", "Ignacia Allamand (Cordelia)", "Diego Casanueva (Pancho Santander)", "Jaime Vadell (Gaston's Father)", "Ariel Levy (David)", "Nicol\u00e1s Saavedra (Luc Fern\u00e1ndez)", "Nayra Illic (Morgana)", "Ren\u00e9 Mart\u00edn ()", "Mait\u00e9 Pascal ()", "Natalie Soublette (Cecilia)", "Eduardo Bertran ()", "Ignacia Baeza (Argentine Waitress)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
