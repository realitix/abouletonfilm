Indisputably one of the greatest Salomes of our time, Mattila utterly incarnates Oscar Wilde\u2019s petulant, willful, and lust-driven heroine. With Strauss\u2019s groundbreaking music magnifying the degenerate atmosphere and building the erotic tension, this is one opera that is as shocking today as it was at its premiere in 1905.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tatFXRARLyt5RNnNQsgy8RpmBOz.jpg", "actors": ["Karita Mattila ()", "Ildik\u00f3 Koml\u00f3si ()", "Joseph Kaiser ()", "Kim Begley ()", "Juha Uusitalo ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
