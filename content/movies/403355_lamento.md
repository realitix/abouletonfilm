Magdalena finds herself consumed by a grief she cannot overcome. Although the event has shattered her world, she nonetheless manages to \u2018function\u2019 smoothly on a daily basis \u2013 whether this involves trying to sell Sara\u2019s dog Truls, picking up her second daughter\u2019s son from his piano lesson, eating with the family of an evening, attending a session with a spiritualist or going to a bar. These are all things she would have done anyway, and a strict routine helps prevent her pain from rising to the surface. Only when Sara\u2019s former boyfriend visits does she begin to see a path through all her denial, speechlessness and feelings of guilt.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nmzBU14jqxXOm3R6DGPVelGGHTM.jpg", "actors": ["Gunilla R\u00f6\u00f6r ()", "Hendrik Kraft ()", "Bj\u00f6rn Andersson ()", "Sandra Huldt ()", "Andreas Kundler ()", "Simon J.
