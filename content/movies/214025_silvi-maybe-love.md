Her husband has just left her. Until this point, she was fairly content with her life, but now everything is in ruins. A friend advises her to make a fresh start. But how is that supposed to work? Especially if you see yourself as a team player and there\u2019s no team in sight you would want to join. Driven by a sense of longing, helplessness and curiosity, Silvi tries to make new friends and, in her own, touchingly earnest but also na\u00efve and charmingly uninhibited way, starts to take control of her life. Anonymous sex, cosy romanticism and bondage games catapult her from one emotional disaster to the next. But, thankfully, Silvi is indestructible.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bE4XDOaHQ2fOP8g3G8rhBJ6FjRD.jpg", "actors": ["Lina Wendel (Silvi)", "Ivan Gallardo (Juan)", "Thorsten Merten (Michael)", "Harald Polzin (Uwe)", "Peter Trabner (Thomas)", "Gerdy Zint (Paul)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Xw_48FlRshA"}
