The play concentrates on an idea the programme controllers have for a new programme which will follow the trials and tribulations of a group of people left to fend for themselves on a remote island. In this respect, the play is often cited as having anticipated the craze for reality television.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fO2yy3DiCMTD7kH2YSqx80a7roH.jpg", "actors": ["Leonard Rossiter (Co-ordinator Ugo Priest)", "Brian Cox (Lasar Opie)", "Tony Vogel (Nat Mender)", "Susan Neve (Deanie Webb)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
