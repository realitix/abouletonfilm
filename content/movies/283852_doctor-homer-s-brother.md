These issues will throw him into an adventure that would be tragic for him, but still helpful for him to see the truth. The story takes place in Kosovo in 1945, in an atmosphere of uncured wounds, wandering, betrayal, burned homes, typhoid and other postwar misery. An authentic story from those days was taken as the film's basis.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4jd0OOacLytBn98MLauiG0le4vS.jpg", "actors": ["Velimir \"Bata\" \u017divojinovi\u0107 (Simon Petrovi\u0107)", "Voja Miri\u0107 (Doktor Homer)", "Jovan Mili\u0107evi\u0107 (Kapetan Vuk)", "Ljuba Tadi\u0107 (Kalu\u0111er)", "Pavle Vuisi\u0107 (Atanas)", "Zdravka Krstulovi\u0107 (Ana)", "Jelena \u017digon (Vera, bolni\u010darka)", "Petar Prli\u010dko (Lekar)", "Stole Aran\u0111elovi\u0107 (Kurte\u0161)", "Janez Vrhovec ()", "Darko Damevski ()", "Pan\u010de Kamd\u017eik ()", "Abdurrahman Shala (Bandit)", "Istref Begolli ()", "Vukan Dimevski ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
