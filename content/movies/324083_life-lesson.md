Life Lesson is a poetic and philosophic reflection on the theme of paradise lost. Some fifty persons illustrate the planet's convulsions and the world's vacillations. Trying to communicate, to commune with the invisible, they cry out, sing out, give out messages, each in their own way, in their own state of solitude. These are like multiple echoes that resemble waves in the water or stars in the sky. \" Behind these images and sounds that have been stifled by today's society, Lehman hunts for noises, cries, songs, messages that go astray. He says that if we look at the invisible we may hear the words. He invites us to look beyond the appearances of social life and to vibrate in tune with life's polyphony that is all around us.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j5PdMj0PccymmqFip3GQf9GIA7l.jpg", "actors": ["Loup Abramovici ()", "Saguenail Abramovici ()", "Blanche Ir\u00e8ne Albera ()", "Laure H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Albera ()", "Tara Beckers ()", "Andr\u00e9 Blavier ()", "Antoine Bonfanti ()", "Lola Bonfanti ()", "Isabelle Brisset ()", "Michel-Jean B\u00e9langer ()", "Jacques Calonne ()", "Raymonde Carasco ()", "Henri Colpi ()", "Marie Cordoba ()", "Jerry David ()", "Yvann Drion ()", "Monique Gelders ()", "R\u00e9gina Guimara\u00ebs ()", "Chang Ning Ho ()", "Jules Imberechts ()", "Lola Lapiower ()", "Renelde Li\u00e9geois ()", "Jean-Claude Maes ()", "Ari\u00e9 Mandelbaum ()", "Georges Miedzianagora ()", "Joseph Morder ()", "Marcel Piqueray ()", "Paule Pozner ()", "Val\u00e9rie Pozner ()", "Jacques Roman ()", "Fernand Schirren ()", "Pierre Schwarz ()", "Nina Vig ()", "Marie-Jeanne Voz ()", "Micha Wald ()", "C\u00e9cile Zervudacki ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
