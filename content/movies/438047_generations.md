Barbara Hammer, 70 years old, hands the camera to Gina Carducci, a young queer filmmaker. Shooting during the last days of Astroland at Coney Island, New York, the filmmakers find that the inevitable fact of aging echoes in the architecture of the amusement park and in the emulsion of the film medium itself. Inspired by Shirley Clarke\u2019s Bridges Go Round, both filmmakers edited picture and sound separately, joining their films in the middle when they finished making a true generational and experimental experiment.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Barbara Hammer ()", "Gina Carducci ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
