Sans le vouloir, tous se retrouvent dans les tr\u00e9fonds du Dark Web et d\u00e9couvrent rapidement que quelqu'un les observe et que cet inconnu est pr\u00eat \u00e0 tout pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer son portable et prot\u00e9ger ses secrets.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5rQiBjMUhdwpBt9QoZiijcGHR4n.jpg", "actors": ["Colin Woodell (Matias O'Brien)", "Betty Gabriel (Nari Jemisin)", "Rebecca Rittenhouse (Serena Lange)", "Andrew Lees (Damon Horton)", "Connor Del Rio (Aj Williams)", "Stephanie Nogueras (Amaya DeSoto)", "Savira Windyani (Lexx Putri)", "Chelsea Alden (Kelly)", "Alexa Mansour (Erica Dunne)", "Bryan Adrian (Jack)", "Douglas Tait (Charon IV)", "Rob Welsh (Charon V)", "Kiara Beltran (Charon VI)", "Eric Shamm Watson (Final Charon)", "Ashton Smiley (Barely 18 - 69 Girl)", "Maya Nalli (Girl in Barrel)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "Gimly", "content": "Something that I've noticed recently in horror franchises that have tried to get off the ground in the past couple of years, the second entry is actually better than the first. In ages past, a thing unheard of, but now at least as common as not. Same goes for _Unfriended: Dark Web_. Just about everything is one step up from the first _Unfriended_ movie: Acting, AV, urgency, the shorter wait times, and the new direction _Dark Web_ takes in terms of its antogonists (I won't spoil it for you, but surely you're capable of reading a title and putting it together for yourself) works better in this one too. I feel at least.\r\n\r\nNow neither of these films are perfect, but the first _Unfriended_ movie was okaaaaaaaaay, and this one has managed to push it by the skin of it's teeth over in to what I could honestly argue is \"good\".\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"}], "recommandations_id": [489999, 371608, 439015, 470229], "youtube_key": "4DJAWGXkvq8"}
