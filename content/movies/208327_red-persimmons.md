The inhabitants explain that it is the perfect combination of earth, wind and rain that makes their village\u2019s persimmons superior to those grown anywhere else, including the village just a few miles away. The film\u2019s larger subject, however, is the disappearance of Japan\u2019s traditional culture, the end of a centuries-old way of life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jAjref1f303fbCWN74Iv0j4Oqoo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
