Filmed while Dexter was living in Europe, these shows feature legendary side musicians such as Art Taylor (drums) and Kenny Drew (piano) and jazz classics \"Blues Walk\", \"A Night In Tunisia\", \"Body And Soul\" and others. One of the most influential saxophonists in jazz history (both John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins claim him as an influence), Dexter Gordon is captured in sharp form and style on this 70-minute tour de force.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2osHVNRHauEcLuWntm47GQPcqzm.jpg", "actors": ["Dexter Gordon ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
