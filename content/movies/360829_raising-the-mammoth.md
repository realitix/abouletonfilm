So he finds a buried mammoth in the vast, rock hard permafrost of Siberia, digs it out in the middle of a blizzard and flies it home. Of course he needed a little help. So he befriended an arctic nomad who knows ever rill, rock, pond and stream in the entire region. As background to the quest, National Geographic relates the migratory history of the mammoth family.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mXQLRfjqX6j6bSKdEkDvaHt6r7C.jpg", "actors": ["Jeff Bridges (Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
