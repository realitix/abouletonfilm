While in college she meets and becomes close to Rajib, a drug dealer. Developing an intense hatred for men, inspired by her violent and insensitive father, she identifies as a lesbian. Her introduction to the drug-scene engulfs her and she develops a cocaine habit which rapidly accelerates into a preference for White China heroin. She meets and falls in love with Rajibs ex drug-dealing partner, Vela, who has already become a hardcore junkie. Her and Vela's downward spiral into chronic addiction is portrayed powerfully throughout the film as is their intense attachment to each other. The plot (based on a true story) is exceptional in its depiction of the drug problems in Indonesia, the often terrible 'solutions' to these problems, and the reasons behind why they occur.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8Mms2XvbjzAHsIY1DSqB0KXfi1Y.jpg", "actors": ["Cornelia Agatha (Regi)", "Sausan Machari (Vela)", "Mike Muliadro (Rajib)", "Shanty (Helena)", "Ari Sudarsono (Papa Regi)", "Dewi Irawan (Mama Regi)", "Sujiwo Tejo (dr.
