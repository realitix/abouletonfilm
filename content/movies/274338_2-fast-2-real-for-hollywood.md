The name speaks for itself:  2FAST? - 205 mph on a bike and a 150mph wheelie is way too fast for the street!  2REAL? - It's incredible what takes place on public streets: cops, tickets and more.  FOR HOLLYWOOD? No actor or film director could capture the raw drama and thrilling reality of street racing.  The film is packed with gut-wrenchingly fast racing including a burnout in Time Square! There are also police busts galore and lots and lots of delicious American honeyz to drool over!  It's fast, scary and very illegal - you have been warned!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mZ0wlzubhLpGNdhm5OyOfxJ0qYm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
