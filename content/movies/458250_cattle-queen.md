After conning a potential buyer (Robert Robinson) into believing that Queenie's herd is diseased, nasty would-be empire builder Duke Drake (Robert Gardett) is confronted by the girl's new tough foreman, Bill Foster (Drake Smith). In retaliation, Drake frames Bill for a stage robbery, actually committed by his own henchmen, and arranges a phony trial presided over by the saloon's bartender, Judge Whipple (Douglas Wood). Queenie, however, interrupts the \"trial\" with the news that the townswomen have all elected Jim marshal. To uphold the decision, Bill has secured the release of three convicted outlaws: Blackie Malone (Joe Bailey), Bad Bill Smith (James Pierce), and Shotgun Thompson (Emile Meyer), two of whom join in the fight against Drake and his gang.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p1cuFurj82B1qDPvxEOMkBmHp7K.jpg", "actors": ["Maria Hart (Queenie Hart)", "Drake Smith (Bill Foster)", "William Fawcett (Alkali)", "Robert Gardett (Duke Drake (as Robert Gardette))", "Johnny Carpenter (The Tucson Kid (as John Carpenter))", "Edward Clark (Doc Hodges)", "Emile Meyer (Shotgun Thompson)", "James Pierce (Bad Bill Smith (as Jim Pierce))", "Joe Bailey (Blackie Malone)", "Douglas Wood (Judge Whipple, Bartender)", "Alyn Lockwood (Rosa, Saloon Girl)", "I.
