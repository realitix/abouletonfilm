The constant presence of sounds of gunfire and, in night scenes, the additional illumination by tracer bullets, adds urgency and another layer of feeling to this fairly conventional romance. In the story, Mira (Paolina Galves) has just returned home to Dushanbe from Russia to visit her father (Bokhodur Dzhurabaev), a wastrel who is completely addicted to a local gambling game called \"odds and evens,\" or Kosh Ba Kosh. Even though he has no power over her, he recently wagered (and lost) her in a game of odds and evens. Meanwhile, she has met a cable car operator (Daler Madzhidov) with whom she forms a relationship.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ew84NzBm0XGXeJh2BCuxXCm8oX7.jpg", "actors": ["Paulina G\u00e1lvez (Mira)", "Daler Madzhidov (Daler)", "Alisher Kasimov (Farhad)", "Bokhodur Djurabajev (Mira's father)", "Albardji Bakhirova (Daler's mother)", "Rahmonkul Kurbanov (Daler's father)", "Radjab Khusseinov (Ibrohim)", "Georgi Strokov (Henry)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
