For '71 it\u2019s a novel concept to bring visual life to an LP, but even more surprising are the short film\u2019s amazing visuals that director Averty crafted using a wealth of video filters, overlays, camera movements and chroma key effects. Averty applies these in tandem with the increasing tone of Gainsbourg\u2019s songs, which more or less chronicle an older man's affair with a young girl. Each song is comprised of steady, sometimes brooding poetic delivery, with refrains timed to the phrase repeats of each song, while Alan Parker\u2019s buzzing guitar accompanies and wiggles around Gainsbourg\u2019s resonant voice. The bass is fat and groovy, the drums easy but steady, and the periodic use of strings or rich vibrato makes this short a sultry little gem.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aoKT4PibHaTb912atsppjFWt5vg.jpg", "actors": ["Jane Birkin (Melody Nelson)", "Serge Gainsbourg (L'homme)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "7X5LwFCHNe4"}
