Its propulsion is towards the ecstatic \u2014 shifting and turning among tenderness, wildness, precision, abandon; qualities that could at any moment be sensual, comic, joyous, repellent. Physical equivalences are enacted as a psychic imagistic stream, in which the layered elements mesh and gain intensity by the energy complement of the audience. The original performances became notorious and introduced a vision of the 'sacred erotic.' This video was converted from original film footage of three 1964 performances of Meat Joy at its first staged performance at the Festival de la Libre Expression, Paris, Dennison Hall, London, and Judson Church, New York City.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cg35YWMrooFnoezwFy4KcKwIizi.jpg", "actors": ["Carolee Schneemann ()", "Jacques Seiler ()", "Claudia Hutchins ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
