By that I mean full-length, done with decent cameras and professional editing equipment. Has an action-adventure plot involving the Amazon, a lost band of Nazis attempting to take over the world and all sorts of craziness on that level. Thus far, also my longest movie to date and the only one with a musical number.  - Benjamin J.
