Most of the relief aid comes from a grassroots effort in America during the past five years by a courageous Air Force intelligence officer, Col. Victor Kuchar, who is the highest ranking officer to regularly travel into the tribal regions. Col. Kuchar, a Catholic from a small Michigan parish, has captured the hearts and minds of the youngsters, as well as the respect of the elders, mostly Pashtun, or Sunni Muslims, who call him \"Mullah\" (a local leader). The interaction between U.S. Forces and these forgotten family members of fighters killed or maimed helping drive out the Taliban, post 9/11, and who continue at our side in the war on terror against Al-Qaeda and other Muslim extremist groups, is both heartbreaking and heartwarming.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wET5bEnmIp7xrGwQXXwxrgw6Za1.jpg", "actors": ["Anthony Hornus (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
