An aspiring actress in Mumbai battles to break into Bollywood; two friends in Scotland take a mobile film festival across the highlands; a young crew in Hong Kong embarks on the shooting of its first film; a Tunisian director anxiously anticipates the premiere of his controversial film at a major festival. These stories are woven together with scenes from video stores, projection booths, studios, cinemas, and slums into a vivid meditation on the power of cinema to shape our world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t3rf0YI2npF7x27TXUMzbAtseNm.jpg", "actors": ["Tilda Swinton (Herself)", "Mark Cousins (Himself)", "Stanley Kwan (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
