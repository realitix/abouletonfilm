Even dating back to his early Plus 8 career, the bespectacled Plastikman was known for his network of labels and affiliate artists (not to mention his epic parties) as he was for fabled CD booklets dipped in LSD. In 2009, Hawtin brought his two decades worth of interest even closer together by teaming up with artist from his Minus label to re-define the way in which live electronic musicians, video artists, lighting designers and DJs collaborate. The result was the CONAKT series of concerts that found Hawtin, along with DJs Magda and Troy Pierce, and producers Marc Houle, Heartthrob and Gaiser creating a multi-platform performance set-up that allowed the performers to play together.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mbcoQ9eUDILHCaVyDmwILAr34ak.jpg", "actors": ["Magda Chojnacka (Magda Chojnacka)", "Ali M.
