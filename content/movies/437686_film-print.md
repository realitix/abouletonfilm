The repetitious camera movements over successive photographs are intended to function as distancing devices relatable to mechanical repetitions such as film loops. The 'subject' of the film is the material operation or, rather, it is a film in its own right and an explication of the mechanisms and technique inherent in its making. It is not a documentary of those mechanisms and techniques. Film as anonymous production, wherein (exhaustively) certain techniques are utilized, does combat with film that represents the (absent) subject, the filmmaker (forever repressed ever-present, ever-represented). Film as presentation, not re-presentation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mxX44TohQpxqKIWMph0j2302QFm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
