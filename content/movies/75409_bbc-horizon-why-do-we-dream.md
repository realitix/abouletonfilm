In a series of cutting-edge experiments and personal stories, we go in search of the science behind this most enduring mystery and ask: where do dreams come from? Do they have meaning? And ultimately, why do we dream? What the film reveals is that much of what we thought we knew no longer stands true. Dreams are not simply wild imaginings but play a significant part in all our lives as they have an impact on our memories, the ability to learn, and our mental health. Most surprisingly, we find nightmares, too, are beneficial and may even explain the survival of our species.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6hKFmVgmS66QGp9d5hajbL3qdOX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
