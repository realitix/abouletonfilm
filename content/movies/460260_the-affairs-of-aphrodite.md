She is not only to perform the expected duties of a slave but is also to take part in the depraved sexual activities the two gods constantly engage in. What they don't know is that the slave is actually Sappho, the exiled Cretan queen. They buy another female slave, Katenga, and take them back to their home on Mount Olympus. When young Paris, who is in love with Sappho, hears about it, he shows up at Mount Olympus to try to rescue her, but fails and is taken prisoner by Aphrodite and Apollo, who use him in their perverted sexual games. Paris and Sappho seemingly go along with them, but are actually plotting their escape. Complications ensue.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tTtbEbMBGmXaljWWGxgjFDpziDb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
