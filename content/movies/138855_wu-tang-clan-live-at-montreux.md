With the exception of the sadly deceased Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard, the whole Clan was present: RZA, GZA, Method Man, Inspectah Deck, Raekwon The Chef, U-God, Ghostface Killah and Masta Killa. Also joining the party were some of their extended family members: Cappadonna, Streetlife and DJ Mathematics. This rare gathering of the full clan took Montreux by storm and got the whole audience on their feet and jumping with a set featuring all their best known hits and classics plus a number of solo tracks, including a clutch of Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard hits.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/li1PPoXs12WEzaQN1LslpxKh9wU.jpg", "actors": ["RZA (himself)", "The GZA (himself)", "Raekwon (himself)", "Method Man (himself)", "Ghostface Killah (himself)", "U-God (himself)", "Cappadonna (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
