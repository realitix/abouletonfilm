If you've seen one _Mega Shark_, you've essentially seen them all. But like its predecessor, _Mecha Shark_, this entry at least has a little more effort on the part of script, acting and CGI. Those things all still suck, but they are an improvement on the origin.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing.
