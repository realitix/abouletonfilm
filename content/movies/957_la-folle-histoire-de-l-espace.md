It\u2019s consistently amusing with several laugh-out-loud bits and memorable lines.\r\n\r\nThe cast is notable, highlighted by John Candy as Barf, Daphne Zuniga as Princess Vespa, Rick Moranis as Dark Helmet, Brooks as Yogurt, and Joan Rivers\u2019 voice as Dot Matrix. The rest are good too (Bill Pullman as Lone Starr, George Wyner as Colonel Sandurz, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 36 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"}], "recommandations_id": [8005, 926, 11072, 1648]}
