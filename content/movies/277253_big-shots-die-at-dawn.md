I have no plot to share, unfortunately, so I'll just add a few more screencaps than usual to make up for it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tTncDuKWMpLxNQDd6hUEEAXcsiJ.jpg", "actors": ["Y\u00fbz\u00f4 Kayama (Jiro)", "Kumi Mizuno ()", "Mickey Curtis ()", "Akihiko Hirata ()", "Jun Tazaki ()", "Tadao Nakamaru ()", "Ichir\u00f4 Nakatani ()", "Yukiko Shimazaki ()", "Eijir\u00f4 Yanagi ()", "Sachio Sakai ()", "Ren Yamamoto ()", "Senkichi \u00d4mura ()", "Hisashi Igawa ()", "Kunie Tanaka ()", "Fuyuki Murakami ()", "Hideo Sunazuka ()", "Masanobu Oki ()", "K\u00f4ji Iwamoto ()", "Kan Hayashi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
