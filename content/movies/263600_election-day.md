What's the street-level experience of voters in today's America? In a triumph of documentary storytelling, ELECTION DAY combines eleven stories--all shot simultaneously on November 2, 2004, from dawn until long past midnight--into one. Factory workers, ex-felons, harried moms, Native American activists and diligent poll watchers, from South Dakota to Florida, take the process of democracy into their own hands. The result: an entertaining, inspiring and sometimes unsettling tapestry of citizens determined on one fateful day to make their votes count.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5QhImK4IA6KD7hu1y6Co5qWdGlG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
