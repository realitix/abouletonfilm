He\u2019s certainly not in top streetfighting form anymore, and the young thugs under his command aren\u2019t exactly an elite troop of criminals. Moreover, his wife is running out of patience with his career choice and the lack of social finesse it entails, and his dearly loved daughter is embarrassed beyond words by her often uncouth dad (but then, aren\u2019t all teenagers?). A conflict with another gang puts Kang and his childhood buddy on opposite sides of the fence. The fact is, Kang just wants everything to work out right for everyone \u2013- and we all know which road is paved with good intentions\u2026 the road to hell.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r32KWFc2jRItbAzHypGu9yHSfNs.jpg", "actors": ["Song Kang-ho (Kang In-goo)", "Park Ji-young (Mi-ryung)", "Kim So-eun (Hee-soo)", "Oh Dal-su (Hyun-soo)", "Yoon Je-moon (Director Noh)", "Choi Il-hwa (Chairman Noh)", "Choi Jong-ryul (owner of dumpling restaurant)", "Jeong In-gi (police chief)", "Kim Kyung-ik (Hee-soo's teacher)", "Kwon Tae-won (police chief of police substation)", "Lee Dae-yeon (Co.
