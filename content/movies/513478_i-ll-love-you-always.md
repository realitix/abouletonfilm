He finally acquires a position that will require him to go to Russia for a period of time, while Nora goes back to the stage during his absence. But he loses out on the job at the last minute, and rather than tell Nora he has failed again, he steals a roll of money from his prospective employer to buy some things for Nora and go out and have a good time before, she things, his departure. His departure is to jail rather than Russia and he hides the truth from Nora by having an acquaintance mail his letters from Russia. He then finds out that Nora is pregnant.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gGtnqbUusVi8xwoGU7tW72SQuHb.jpg", "actors": ["Nancy Carroll (Nora Clegg)", "George Murphy (Carl Brent)", "Raymond Walburn (Charlie)", "Arthur Hohl (Jergens)", "Jean Dixon (Mae Waters)", "Robert 'Tex' Allen (Joe)", "Harry Beresford (Mr. Clegg)", "Paul Harvey (Sandstone)", "Eadie Adams (Singer (uncredited))", "Irving Bacon (Theater Manager (uncredited))", "Lucille Ball (Lucille (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
