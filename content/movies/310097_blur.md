Disabled as a result of a home invasion that took the life of his late wife, Sarah, Raymond sits in his makeshift apartment above a run down bar, over medicated, mourning her loss and contemplating suicide. His only contact with the world, besides his close friend Paul are the three computer screens that blink emotionlessly at him twenty four hours a day, through sleepless nights. There, he sees the universe, filled with images of webcams around the world, from petty crimes and private confessions, to public tragedies and natural disasters. It is here, one night, as Raymond finishes piecing together an old video recording of his late wife, that he sees a mysterious woman, Layla. The image of her is unexpected, sexual, as she goes through a ritualistic set of gestures that leads to an emotional plea to Raymond", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1ntIXzcMEchgDsHlBnZZPw93bmY.jpg", "actors": ["Charlie Hofheimer (Raymond)", "Katharine Towne (Sarah)", "Burt Bulos (Paul)", "Emily Marie Grant (Lone Woman Tableau)", "Lila Green (Larissa (as Lila Green-Goodwin))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
