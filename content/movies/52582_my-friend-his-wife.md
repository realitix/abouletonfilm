Ye-joon has lately worked his way up to becoming a successful financier, while the unambitious Jae-moon has opted for a much less conspicuous route. He now works as a cook and is enjoying family life with his wife Ji-sook and their new-born son. Ji-sook tolerates her husband\u2019s attachment to his friend, but everything changes after the tragic death of the child, caused by Ye-joon. Ji-sook was in Paris when the tragedy occurred and isn\u2019t aware of the circumstances; she even starts an affair with Ye-joon when her husband is imprisoned after taking the blame for his son\u2019s death. Relationships which were originally crystal-clear begin to grow distinctly cloudy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5lQRRM5OSi0sjvj6TBt9Kx0BilK.jpg", "actors": ["Jang Hyun-sung (Ye-joon)", "Hong So-hee ()", "Park Hee-soon ()", "Cho Seong-ha (Director)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
