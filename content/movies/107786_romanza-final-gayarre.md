At 19, a professor at the Conservatory of Music in Madrid heard him singing for the first time and offered him a scholarship to continue his studies. His artistic life runs between continued success, becoming the world's greatest tenor. But in 1890, while singing at the Teatro Real in Madrid, a failure in his voice is like a cruel reminder of what would happen a few days later: his death at a young age. The doctors gave a diagnosis, but his friends know that Julian Gayarre died because he could not sing anymore.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oY8Uu0zY6FwS1BGhSlVmWKjUmzp.jpg", "actors": ["Jos\u00e9 Carreras (Juli\u00e1n Gayarre)", "Sydne Rome (Alicia)", "Antonio Ferrandis ()", "Mario Pardo ()", "Susana Campos ()", "Montserrat Caball\u00e9 ()", "Alexandra Delli Colli ()", "Carlos Mendy ()", "Alberto Closas ()", "Aitana S\u00e1nchez-Gij\u00f3n (Alicia)", "Walter Vidarte ()", "Gabriel Llopart ()", "Alejandro Ulloa ()", "Manuel Collado ()", "Hugo Blanco ()", "Jes\u00fas Puente ()", "Carlos Ballesteros ()", "G\u00e9rard Tichy ()", "Carlos Manuel D\u00edaz ()", "Ver\u00f3nica Forqu\u00e9 (Alicia's voice)", "Julio Gavilanes ()", "Aitor Merino ()", "Rub\u00e9n Tob\u00edas ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "x0EBvldg7_w"}
