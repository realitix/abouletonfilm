Charting the heritage and historical importance of these revered temples of learning - from their Scottish beginnings during the mid-18th century right up to present day - against a series of candid interviews with British luminaries such as Stephen Fry, Irvine Welsh, Bonnie Wright, John Cooper Clarke, Robert Montgomery and William Seighart, the documentary makes a passionate plea to save Britain's libraries from the reality of today's political and economic climate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Amli3vkXrZUGdBs1hfKzsrOxff7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
