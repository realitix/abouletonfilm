Before his death, Eamon predicted an event at work and, after his death, never stopped sending Bonnie messages of love from beyond. Soon after Eamon died, Bonnie realized she wasn't alone in her experiences; she gathered up similar haunting stories from family and friends who also lost loved ones on 9/11 and published Messages: Signs, Visits and Premonitions from Loved Ones Lost on 9/11. In this one-hour special, families of 9/11 victims share the emotional first-person stories of the messages they received from beyond.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
