At the age of 60, after forty years as a Baptist preacher and \"small motor repairman\", Finster heeded the call to \"paint sacred art\". In a tour-de-force of self styled \"talking art\", Finster describes the prophetic dreams, spiritual inspirations and visionary experiences that led him to become a painter. His work was selected in 1984 to represent the United States in the prestigious Venice Biennale", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r3Wf3lnFiNxz6lW9pudIPqZXy9n.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
