The film begins in modern times, when a pair of Beethoven enthusiasts purchase the hair at a Sotheby's auction. The story then looks at the lock's previous owners and culminates in the science that reveals Beethoven's \"medical secret\". Set to a lush score of some of Beethoven's most glorious music, the film explores the world of forensic testing in sharp relief against the romance of 19th-century Vienna and the horrors of 20th-century Nazi Germany.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yfaNLkrxv0xsJL0GXfvLsqedtQy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
