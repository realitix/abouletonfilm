From her relationships with James Dean and other Hollywood luminaries to her significant contributions to the eventual Goth craze, Nurmi was a multifaceted woman, with more than a few amazing stories to share. Having befriended Nurmi while she was still alive, Greene finds himself perfectly situated to give us the complete story on this fascinating individual, blending extensive interviews with remarkable found footage of Nurmi's long and varied career. Whether being groomed by a major Hollywood director or making a surprising foray into music, Nurmi proves herself to be so much more than a scream queen. Still, when it comes to snappy one-liners cracked at the stroke of midnight, it's certainly safe to say that no one did it better than Vampira.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a9NYXiYTZK3bqVXMlRfsfkvOsOK.jpg", "actors": ["Maila Nurmi (Herself)", "Gloria Pall (Herself)", "Dana Gould (Himself)", "Jennifer Van Goethem (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "G2qSD23gmBc"}
