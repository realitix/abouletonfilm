It is a celebration of my father\u2019s life, a meditation on his body and a visual record of mourning. When my father died, there was never a chance to see his body after life had left it. This film was made by placing his ashes directly on 35mm film in a dark room and moving the film a frame at a time. What we see in this process of photograming is not the object in the photographic sense, but instead a representation of the space surrounding an object. The photogram is a shadow charting the distance between things.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/46c5KibmKNHTkqnYJrPICapCJcZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
