Much the same thing happened in 1952. While 20th Century-Fox's Les Miserables, starring Michael Rennie as beleagured ex-convict Jean Valjean, was making the rounds, a second version, lensed in Italy, was also showing up in selected theatres. Running a fast 112 minutes (hardly enough time to do full justice to the novel), U.S. release of the Italian adaptation starred Gino Servi as Valjean, whose \"new\" life as a man of position and respect is forever threatened by dogged detective Javert. Valentine Cortese costars as Cosette, Valjean's adopted daughter. English-language prints of the the Italian Les Miserables credit the direction to \"Robert Hampton\"; in fact, direction was handled by prominent European filmmaker Riccardo Freda.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nPIHwyEgPkgSwQeALWV57q7LwwX.jpg", "actors": ["Gino Cervi (Jean Valjean)", "Valentina Cortese (Fantine)", "Hans Hinrich (Javert)", "Luigi Pavese (Th\u00e9nardier)", "Jone Romano (La Th\u00e9nardier)", "Aldo Nicodemi (Marius)", "Delia Orman (\u00c9ponine)", "Marcello Mastroianni (Un rivoluzionario)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
