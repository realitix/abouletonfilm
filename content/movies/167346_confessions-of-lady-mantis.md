Finally she seduces a professional killer, which brings a tiny bit of action into the comedy oriented film. Being a Toei production, Mantis Wife\u2019s Confession looks like real movie rather than a cheap exploitation production. Unfortunately the storyline is running circles, and there\u2019s little to get excited about. A couple of good jokes make you laugh a few times, and one surprise has found its way into the film; Ema Ryoko plays a housewife. She gets into a fight, but her shirt stays on and doesn\u2019t even get ripped.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6APJ7kQBWDbIGf68I77crUuqIkV.jpg", "actors": ["Midori Satsuki (Midori)", "Shingo Yamashiro (Tsushima)", "Yuki Morisaki (Sayuri Hoshikawa)", "Goro Naniwa (Butler)", "Tetsuo Ohshita (Yukawa)", "Ry\u00f4ko Ema (Shizuko Yukawa)", "Tetsuo Fujisawa ()", "Seiz\u00f4 Fukumoto ()", "Mieko Hoshino ()", "Yoshihiro Igarashi ()", "Eiz\u00f4 Kitamura ()", "Mineko Maruhira ()", "Hiroshi Nawa ()", "Gor\u00f4 Ibuki ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
