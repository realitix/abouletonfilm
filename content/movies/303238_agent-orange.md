But the lethal chemical proved to be a sentence worse than death for the babies born to anyone who came into contact with it. His investigations lead him to Africa and Clive Hyde, a bullying fertilizer baron whose greed for wealth far outweighs his social conscience. Posing as a journalist for an agricultural magazine, Steve suspects that it is Hyde's chemical plant that provides the crop spraying fertilizer used by the sugar cane farmers to make their crop grow taller. When the beautiful, young widow, Sarah Williams, shows Steve her stunted and grotesquely twisted vegetable crop, his suspicions are confirmed; and when he discovers Patrick and Maria's disfigured child he sets out to crush Hyde's illicit operation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/68g7YDnRM5gE76WWCkApc7JvSHi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
