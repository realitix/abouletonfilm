{"tmdb_id": 133130, "title": "World Class Kids", "original_title": "World Class Kids", "slug_title": "world-class-kids", "date": "", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "\"An Arab, a Jew, a Chinese, and a Philippine walk to school \u2026\" \u2013 sounds like the beginning of an old joke, but that\u2019s not the case. These are some of the second-grade pupils attending an Elementary School, in the heart of Tel Aviv. The film follows the class throughout one school-year, which becomes volatile as the Gaza War upsets the social dynamics in the classroom. With poignant intuition and uninhibited directness, unique to eight-year olds, the children point out basic conflicts in Israeli society, deal with painful identity issues, and experience the first cracks in their childhood naivety.
