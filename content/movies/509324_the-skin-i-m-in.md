Strangers pulled him to safety, giving him a second chance at life and propelling him on a global journey to explore the limits of body, mind, spirit and art. Spanning Germany, Canada, Japan, Kenya, and the United States, Fox's journey includes collaborations with Canadian First-Nations artist Rande Cook and African-American artist Zulu, who help him memorialize his experiences in a full back tattoo. In our digital age where personal confession and self-exposure abound, Fox instead transforms his experiences into art, making a film that is both innovative and accessible.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vJzYbh380XqTNQdubZhI0HRR4Ib.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
