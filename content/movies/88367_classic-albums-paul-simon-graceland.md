But the rise of 1980s rock and new wave saw a decline in Simon's commercial success, and the singer responded by experimenting with different musical styles--most notably, world beat--that culminated in his adventurous 1986 masterpiece GRACELAND. The album's fusion of American folk-rock songwriting and buoyant South African rhythms not only broke new ground in pop music, but became Simon's biggest-selling solo record. This episode of the CLASSIC ALBUMS series examines the making of Simon's groundbreaking work through interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, music videos, and live performances of album tracks such as \"Boy in the Bubble,\" \"Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes,\" \"You Can Call Me Al,\" and \"Under African Skies.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fbAAHNGQPszmXBCSXKA0hfTYi3C.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Simon (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
