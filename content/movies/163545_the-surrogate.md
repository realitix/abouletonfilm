His temper gets the best of him, so he's seeing a psychotherapist who finds the anger and the impotence related. She recommends that Frank and Lee hire a mysterious European woman to lead them through fantasies intended to unlock passion and help them heal. At the same time this is going on, the police are investigating a series of stabbings: as corpses pile up, we wonder if Frank's temper may be behind this; or perhaps it's Eric, a cross-dressing neighbor and friend of Lee's; it may even be the European woman, who keeps popping up with new fantasies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rG4Nh02LVtrYsgZeuUOJS4cnIqL.jpg", "actors": ["Art Hindle (Frank Waite)", "Carole Laure (Anouk Van Derlin)", "Shannon Tweed (Lee Waite)", "Michael Ironside (George Kyber)", "Jim Bailey (Eric)", "Marilyn Lightstone (Dr. Foreman)", "Jackie Burroughs (Woman at Anouk's)", "Barbara Law (Maggie Simpson)", "Gary Reineke (John Manyon)", "Vlasta Vr\u00e1na (Bill)", "Ron Lea (Salesman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
