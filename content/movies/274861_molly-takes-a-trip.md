When she arrives she finds that all the residents, other than a small, tightly knit group of Elijah's friends have left for winter. When Elijah doesn't materialize at his own party, his guests carry on in his honor, having a bacchanalian night fueled with booze and psychedelics, playing games and telling stories of their absent friend. As a storm threatens their night of fun, Molly experiences a surreal evening of emotional and sexual exploration she won't soon forget.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zpZlAWhFRORQe82UcV9oCZI6JkD.jpg", "actors": ["Angela Gulner (Hannah)", "Geri-Nikole Love (Claire)", "Jake Mann (Turk)", "Elsa Carette (Molly)", "Ken Urbina (Joe)", "Charlie Wilson (Wyatt)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
