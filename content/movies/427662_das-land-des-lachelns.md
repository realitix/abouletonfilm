There are no weak links in the cast. Too often, we think of operetta as musical fluff, tired cliches, and obligatory dance scenes when things start slowing down. Not so in this classic operetta. We feel the pain of loss suffered by the two main characters, who make their roles natural and believable. There is more to this work than \"Yours Is My Heart Alone.\" There is dramatic consistency and people you find yourself caring about as much as the music, the costumes, and the colorful sets.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6hra1euaTbuPDjbGYT372SqBx6b.jpg", "actors": ["Birgit Sarata (Lisa)", "Ren\u00e9 Kollo (Prinz Sou-Chong)", "Dagmar Koller (Mi)", "Heinz Zednik (Graf Gustav von Pottenstein)", "Gerd Frickh\u00f6ffer (Tschang)", "Teh Wei Ma (Lu-Li)", "Henry Georgy (General)", "Betty Sedlmayr (Generalin)", "Fred Liewehr (Graf Lichtenfels)", "Herbert Prikopa (Lin-Po)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
