Our journey begins at Dublin\u2019s Connolly Station. For the first few miles we proceed through the rapidly re-generating suburbs under the wires of the DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit). This is a route of great interest with double line throughout. Our 90 mile an hour express was filmed mostly in sunshine. Much of the history of this interesting and scenic route is related by TV personality Henry Kelly.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q952pjIcY5ONUadLX3FQxp6A1Lm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "cvoh9l895rE"}
