In the Second World War Finland was the only nation who brought casualties killed-in-action back to be buried at home. These actions were carried out by men and women working in assembly centres near enemy lines. Silence is a story of a group of people in a limbo between life and death, in a mental no-man's- land, where heaven and hell, horror and joy, love and fear touch each other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xLbOZKUABlYwqn4qeIpeLzPgCIx.jpg", "actors": ["Joonas Saartamo (Eino)", "Lauri Tilkanen (Antti)", "Joanna Haartti (Siiri)", "Terhi Suorlahti (Jaana)", "Ilkka Heiskanen (Korpikangas)", "Sinikka Mokkila (Kuppari-Miina)", "Kari Hakala (Sotilaspastori Hiltunen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [80382, 45694, 123964, 5063], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
