To make sure that \"those out there don\u00b4t think two nuns no longer make a convent\", they try to keep up a full range of activities. The women\u00b4s headstrong character and their stubborn insistence on autonomy and self-dependency creates situations that are both touching and funny, and entirely unexpected in a place like this.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
