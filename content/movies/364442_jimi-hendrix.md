{"tmdb_id": 364442, "title": "Jimi Hendrix", "original_title": "Jimi Hendrix", "slug_title": "jimi-hendrix", "date": "1973-12-20", "genre": ["Musique / Documentaire"], "score": "8.4/10", "synopsis": "This documentary was made three years after Jimi Hendrix's untimely death. At the time it was an example of how a visual biography should be done, but some of the information in it needs revising in the light of new information uncovered over the years. The film contains concert footage spanning the Marquee in 1967 to his last UK performance at the third Isle of Wight festival in 1970; along the way we see classic performances at Monterey (1967), Woodstock (1969), Fillmore East (1969/70), and Berkeley (1970). A double album was released to tie-in with the film, containing the complete performances in the film, along with interviews with people in the film (not necessarily the same interviews). The film is worth seeing for Jimi's performances, and to hear what his contemporaries have to say about him (Eric Clapton, Mitch Mitchell, Lou Reed, Mick Jagger, Pete Townsend, and others).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2ATzGS2nB4tb5nYZ3KcOuGyUnT4.jpg", "actors": ["Eric Clapton ()", "Lou Reed ()", "Mick Jagger ()", "Little Richard ()", "Pete Townshend ()", "Billy Cox ()", "Alan Douglas ()", "Eddie Kramer ()", "Buddy Miles ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
