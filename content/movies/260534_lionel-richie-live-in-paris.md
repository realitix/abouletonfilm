Given that this is an arena concert, it shouldn't come as a great surprise that this is a big, splashy production, designed for the eyes as much as it is for the ears. This isn't an especially kinetic live performance -- and his stage patter turns irritating on disc, especially his incessant repetition of \"either you're gonna dance on the floor\" on the intro to \"Dancing on the Ceiling\" -- but it's pleasant enough and will be a nice souvenir for those fans who care about a latter-day live performance from Lionel, although they'll like be more satisfied by this show", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oI9056UaFb5lwLmcaBdo7xwbIiX.jpg", "actors": ["Lionel Richie (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
