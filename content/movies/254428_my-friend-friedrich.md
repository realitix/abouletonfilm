Then, in a philosophy class, he almost succeeds in landing a date by lobbing an illustrated invitation at his love interest, Emma. All goes awry when a taller, more confident, bespectacled Columbia student cuts him off at the knees. So far, so very New York student film, but a conceit arrives to distinguish this story of Ivy League dating woes: the ghost of Friedrich Nietzsche appears before Nate to guide him towards self-actualization.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Nathan Gorelick ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
