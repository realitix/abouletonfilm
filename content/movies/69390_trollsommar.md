There they meet the resident country kids who's rosy cheeks and youthful antics mirror the apathy and cynicism of the children grown up in the callous and barren streets of the city. In the country, strange and mysterious things are afoot. Sudden fires, cars braking down and enigmatic sightings point to there being more than the modern man fathoms in the woods. People talk of trolls and beings in the woods, guardians of the land, but the grown ups do not believe and the cynical city children say such talk is nonsense.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cnoz6OUr5PnwuTJX276sktVntCQ.jpg", "actors": ["Teddy Rhodin (Goblin Father)", "Marrit Ohlsson (Goblin Mother)", "Stefan W\u00e5nggren (Humpe)", "Birger \u00c5sander (Old Goblin)", "Sif Ruud (The Old Woman)", "Tommy Johnson (Elis)", "Berit Persson (Mona)", "Lena Lindgren (Karin)", "Thore H\u00e4rdelin (Phan)", "Susanne Hallvares (Huldra)", "Nenne Rydberg (Huldra)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
