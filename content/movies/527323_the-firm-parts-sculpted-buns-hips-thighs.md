Three factors make these routines as effective as they are popular. 1. Performed entirely while lying down, this workout allows maximum-intensity concentration (and muscle toning) by focusing on one body part at a time. 2. Continue to grow stronger and shapelier by gradually increasing ankle weights to five pounds. 3. The FIRM's unique (but optional) trick of adding dumbbells (3-12 lbs.) to \"floor\" exercise adds the ultimate level of intensity and results-especially for the buttocks. Master Instructor Tracie Long leads these tested, proven routines compiled from The FIRM's acclaimed Tortoise & Hare Cross-Trainer workouts.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qUQYVI3sHiGfjj3Wij4iggu4xP1.jpg", "actors": ["Tracie Long (Master Instructor)", "Susan Harris ()", "Stacey Millner-Collins ()", "Dwayne Nelson ()", "April Pauley ()", "Narcisa C.
