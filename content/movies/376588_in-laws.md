It's time to meet their families and to plot the happy event. In-laws seem to understand perfectly: passion for TV series unites luxury, Romanian music of the '80s and brandy. Especially brandy. As the bottles are emptied, misunderstandings begin to appear. Three couples, three visions on marriage: fast and opulence (with white doves and Holograf Fuego), traditional wedding (with musicians and tent), or a youthful? Different options, different camps. No one fails. Moreover, the two parents-in-law remember that they met once, 25 years ago. They were in different camps. Now that miraculously brought back to life to face. Follow great challenge. It takes a miracle that this wedding is to be held.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hmIQsZmJKHouDUZjhWJnaqVexPn.jpg", "actors": ["Mircea Diaconu (\u015etefan Vr\u00e2nceanu)", "Paul Ipate (Ionu\u0163 Ungureanu)", "Lumini\u021ba Gheorghiu (Suzana Vr\u00e2nceanu)", "Ioana Blaj (Mariana Vr\u00e2nceanu)", "Marian R\u00eelea (Ionel Ungureanu)", "Gabriela Popescu (Alice Ungureanu)", "Sergiu Costache (Lucian Popoiu)", "Ana Adelaida Perjoiu (Monica)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
