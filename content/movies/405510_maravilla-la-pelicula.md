Sergio 'Marvelous' Martinez can drop the best boxers with his lightning strikes, floor the most beautiful women with his devastating looks, and has a hard-scrabble immigrant story and work ethic that make him the hero of the Latin street. But a willingness to call it the way he sees it and speak truth to power, has left him a virtual pariah in the notorious corrupt world of professional boxing. This is story of a man fighting to fight. But the clock is ticking. It may already be too late.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mNMF1HamAlZzF7XRsgsa8nObrSR.jpg", "actors": ["Darren Baker (Boxer)", "Oscar de la Hoya (Retired Boxer)", "Julio Cesar Chavez (Retired WBC Boxing Champion)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [285869, 303132, 365183], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
