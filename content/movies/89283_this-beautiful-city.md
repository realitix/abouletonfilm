Chatter from a dinner party in Harry and Carol\u2019s nouveau riche condo drifts through an open balcony door, as two freebase cokeheads, Pretty and Johnny, have a party on their own in the alley below. As the dinner guests leave, the hostess is nowhere to be found. Until, a wet thud and a sharp scream rise up to the balcony.  Pretty stares in horror at Carol\u2019s body, splayed on the alley floor, as Harry screams for help from above. The sharp burst of police sirens sends the cokeheads running as Peter, a middle aged police officer, sprints from his cruiser to check Carol\u2019s vitals.  Rocket forward three months and these five disparate lives begin to cataclysmically intersect through weaving multi-narrative story arcs that release spurts and geysers of long-suppressed sexuality and aggression.  Beautiful things can happen when you hit rock bottom.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l9SMgBTo25HWR29U0VCpOT3BOmy.jpg", "actors": ["Aaron Poole (Johnny)", "Kristin Booth (Pretty)", "Caroline Cave (Carol)", "Noam Jenkins (Harry)", "Kat Germain (Zoe)", "Tony Nappo (Crack)", "Jack Murray (Waiter)", "Christopher Cordell (Green Jacket Jock)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
