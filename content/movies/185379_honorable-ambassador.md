Israel, recognized as a leader in drip-irrigation technology, shares its expertise with countries around the world. Mickey Arbel, Israel\u2019s ambassador to Cameroon, has made it his mission to persuade the residents of rural villages to adopt this system that would finally resolve their irrigation difficulties. However, old ways die hard in Cameroon and things do not always go as planned. Director Jonathan Paz (The Galilee Eskimos, TJFF 2009) follows Arbel on a journey that is by turns surreal, funny and frustrating. For the charismatic Arbel, it is also a journey of soul searching and self-discovery.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
