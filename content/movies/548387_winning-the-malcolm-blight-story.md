Now for the first time he talks about his dazzling career.  The only man to have won the Margarey - Brownlow - Coleman and Farmer medal quadrella. A Premiership star with North Melbourne and the man who broke through to take Adelaide to back to back flags as coach. Along the way there was a short lived stint as playing coach of the Roos, a return to Woodville and three near misses as coach of Geelong.  A remarkable man - a remarkable career.  In WINNING, Melcolm Blight gives a rare insight into the footballer, the coach, the television analyst and the family man. This is a story of success by a man who has been a master at it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sogwavCAfmd7yfXMumBLjRtqGZM.jpg", "actors": ["Malcolm Blight (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
