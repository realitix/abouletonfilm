It was successfully repeated in 2011, when the production was filmed for DVD. Supporting Nemirova\u2019s powerful vision of corruption, decadence and death are the highly praised set designs by the young artist Daniel Richter. Musically, the production is led with style and assurance by the brilliant German conductor Marc Albrecht, currently director of the Netherlands Opera. Singing Lulu with allure and passion is the lauded French soprano Patricia Petibon, whose charms grip an outstanding cast of top European singers. Berg\u2019s score is performed in the completed version by the Austrian composer Friedrich Cerha.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Patricia Petitbon (Lulu)", "Tanja Ariane Baumgartner (Countess Geschwitz)", "Pavol Breslik (The Painter / A Negro)", "Cora Burggraaf (A Theatrical Dresser / A High-School Boy / A Groom)", "Michael Volle (Dr Sch\u00f6n, Editor-in-chief / Jack the Ripper)", "Thomas Piffka (Alwa)", "Franz Grundheber (Schigolch)", "Thomas Johannes Mayer (An Animal Tamer / An Athlete)", "Heinz Zednik (The Prince / The Manservant)", "Andreas Conrad (The Marquis)", "Martin Tzonev (The Theatre Manager / The Banker)", "Emilie Pictet (A Fifteen-year-old girl)", "Cornelia Wulkopf (Her mother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
