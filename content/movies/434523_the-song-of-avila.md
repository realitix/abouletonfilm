In 1967, I decided to visit Avila where I had an enlightening experience. This is a filmed record of my visit to Avila, with my voice telling how I felt there and what happened (especially with the little dogs).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gMNncHnqVPzrIy9PtyQBArUNAHX.jpg", "actors": ["Jonas Mekas (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
