Mid-winter and money is tight at Opera Australia as rehearsals begin for Puccini\u2019s perennial favourite Tosca, a story of love, betrayal and murder set amid the political turmoil of 19th century Rome. With only three weeks before the curtain goes up, not everyone is sure they will make it\u2014least of all director Cathy Dadd and renowned Scottish conductor Roderick Brydon. The drama backstage equals the soaring emotion of Tosca itself. Tension builds and comes to a head in frustration, anger, tears and laughter. Then it\u2019s opening night and they\u2019re on.
