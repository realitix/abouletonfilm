His body spins slowly, filling the frame with mesmerizing continuous motion. Ambient light at times diffuses his image to a rotating blur. He lip-syncs to a jazz rendition of the title song, Girl Talk, sung originally by Tony Bennett, a darling of 60s middle class white culture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uI418b6TbhQOYjgYQZRhACPiFmX.jpg", "actors": ["Fred Moten (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
