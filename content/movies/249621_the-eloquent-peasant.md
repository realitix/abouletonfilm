The events are set between 2160 and 2025 BC. When the peasant Khun-anup and his donkey stumble upon the lands of the noble Rensi, the peasant\u2019s goods are confiscated and he\u2019s unjustly accused of theft. The peasant petitions Rensi who is so taken by the peasant\u2019s eloquence that he report his astonishing discovery to the king. The king realises the peasant has been wronged but delays judgement so as to he can hear more of his eloquence. The peasant makes a total of nine petitions until finally, his goods are returned.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/af3d2D6NjZGOAxL8FED3e3ENu7t.jpg", "actors": ["Anan Ahmad ()", "Ahmad Hegazi ()", "Ahmed Marei ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [55192, 42164, 43976, 38311], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
