Something in the emotional charge of her performances, some fragility beneath the ballerina steel, emphasises the ephemeral nature of the art form. It reminds us that we must seize the day.\" (The Observer)\r\n\r\n\"The Royal Ballet's recent triumphs continue with this exquisite Giselle. Beguiling actress-dancer Alina Cojocaru embraces both Act I's sweet rural girl and the tragic ghost of Act II.\" (BBC Music Magazine)\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing new or revolutionary about this Giselle from the Royal Opera House but it is a beautiful production, superbly danced by a young, fresh-faced cast that dedicate themselves with heart and soul to the performance. It is expertly filmed and edited. The picture is liquid and clear, with contrasting colours, capturing the moonlit forest of Act II perfectly, wonderfully enhancing the ghostly atmosphere.\" (Musicweb International)"}], "recommandations_id": []}
