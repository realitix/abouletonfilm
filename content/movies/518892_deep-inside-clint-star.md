Clint, taking on the role of Clint Star, seeks out his far-flung buddies, young Natives like himself. They talk about sex and life... love and abuse... 500 years of oppression--with humour, grace and courage.  Deep Inside Clint Star explores issues of identity, sexuality and intimacy, while retaining the creative and playful style of a director who is not afraid of turning the camera on himself. This engaging documentary will draw you out of yourself and deep inside Clint Star.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8leR82d3rLBmLh1JXVXTfpsxnQV.jpg", "actors": ["Clint Alberta (Clint Star)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
