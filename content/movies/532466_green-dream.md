Evocative and abstract, Green Dream relies on a wide range of experimental techniques, including pixilation, optical printing, and manipulated motion to achieve a dreamlike state where the relevance of beauty and the irrelevance of use can be contemplated.  Reminiscent of the work of French experimental filmmaker Rose Lawder, Green Dream confronts modern overdevelopment with overpowering life forces.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6xtHFqs6cdkSJyzbpgsMkZVNGkd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
