An extensive collection of exotic masks is hanging on the walls while the night watchman makes his rounds. But not for long: the masks are waiting for the moment when they can reveal their imposing selves to the viewer. A collection of masks from different parts of the world shows its true face: shocking, charming or sinister. Max de Haas brings the faces to life through his camera-eye. Impressive light-and-dark effects and a chaotic music track enable the masques to tell their own stories, even when nobody is wearing them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mOlNXe59mKSfFYVRbgACwjCpguX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
