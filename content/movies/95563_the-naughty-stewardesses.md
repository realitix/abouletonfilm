The plot follows the exploits of four sexy flight attendants, and each of them disrobes in front of the camera and/or engage in intercourse at one point. There's raunchy action with a captain and a lass aboard his plane (in which a small child looks on to get a first hand sex ed class), and a wild party where a nude dude is actually a cake (he gets slobbered by one of the stewardesses!).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uHbWQNszTog1Cw7U5zZbwb5pi7W.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Livingston (Brewster)", "Connie Hoffman (Debbie)", "Richard Smedley (Cal)", "Donna Young (Margie)", "Marilyn Joi (Barbara)", "Sydney Jordan (Jane)", "Al Richardson (EV)", "Jerry Mills (Mike)", "Sandy Carey (Diane)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
