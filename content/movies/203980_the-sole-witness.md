Then an irate passenger files charges against the driver. After the driver appears on the factory worker's doorstep with his wife and three children, pleading with him not to testify, he easily agrees. However, soon he learns that the woman who brought charges against the driver is now being charged by with slander. No matter what he does, someone will suffer unneccessarily.
