Mooch's big brother Wilbert 'Wilby' is smart, shy and a promising inventor, but hopelessly clumsy when it comes to girls, and is jealous of his slick mate Trey who has no problems. Desperate Wilby resorts to a spell from the ring of Lucrezia Borgia (he accidentally got from dad's museum of curiosities), which magically turns him into Bundles and back at uncontrollable times. This is how he also knows that the diamond on loan in his father's museum is Charlie's next target.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AaHZtm07jcyeUL31cjHOEoG9Ty6.jpg", "actors": ["Scott Weinger (Wilby Daniels)", "Ed Begley Jr. (Ron Daniels)", "Sharon Lawrence (Beth Daniels)", "Jon Polito (Detective Al)", "James Cromwell (Charlie)", "Jeremy Sisto (Trey Miller)", "Jordan Warkol ()", "Sarah Lassez ()", "Natasha Gregson Wagner ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [66044, 113211, 352037, 123615], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
