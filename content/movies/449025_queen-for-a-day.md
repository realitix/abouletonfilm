Sara is the only blond and blue-eyed girl in her class, and she is completely overlooked by the kings and queens who do not have blond hair and blue eyes. She has a secret crush on one of the kings, who is way out of her league, and she doesn't have any friends either, but would like to become friends with Karen, also an outsider who aspires to a better status. One day, Sara eyes an opportunity to boost her popularity by humiliating herself and thereby become queen. Karen instantly becomes her friend, she seems to catch the eye of her kingly crush and popularity appears within her reach. However, her happiness is short-lived, and in the end she learns a far more valuable lesson than how to be queen for a day.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ptjuQU1mybDUoFRhcennlIncW2D.jpg", "actors": ["Rosalina Kr\u00f8yer (Sara)", "Mira Balloli (Karen)", "Julia Gormsen (Jessica)", "Sofia Bedjaoui (Talia)", "Josephine Perle Voss (Lisa)", "August Igor Svideniouk Egholm (Konstantin)", "Casper Buddig (Julius)", "Alex Haagensen (Adam)", "William Salicath (Bo)", "Marie Brock (Susan)", "Morten L\u00fctzh\u00f8ft (Sara's Father)", "Mehmet Karabacak (Malik)", "Alexander Hasbo (Alexander)", "Ashcon Nejad (Shahzad)", "Hassam Anwar (Raj)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "K0CaU7p9F3M"}
