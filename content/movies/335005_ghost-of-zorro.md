Mason, the head of the telegraph line work crew, assumes his ancestor's trade-mark mask (but not whip) in order to prevent a local czar (Roy Barcroft) from sabotaging the burgeoning telegraph line. Pamela Blake, a brunette starlet formerly known as Adele Pearce, played Mason's imperiled girlfriend, and the serial also benefitted from the usual competent work of Republic's great stunt-performers, including Dale van Sickel, Tom Steele, Eddie Parker, and Joe Yrigoyen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wigidYrQXpDoW7cVuEARhEYvcQl.jpg", "actors": ["Clayton Moore (Ken Mason)", "Pamela Blake (Rita White)", "Roy Barcroft (Hank Kilgore)", "George J.
