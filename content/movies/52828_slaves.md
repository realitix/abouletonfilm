It takes place in a distant corner of the sado-masochistic world that exists far beyond mere fetishes and role-playing. In this world, sex is extreme, often violent, and people sometimes die.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n3Opdxe3bdCDD0LzFJ45hEpMSLa.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
