Before night falls they build small igloos and we see the construction in detail. The next day a polar bear is seen basking in the warming sun. A woman lights her seal oil lamp, carefully forming the wick from moss. The man repairs his snow goggles. Another man arrives dragging a polar bear skin. The boy has made a bear-shaped figure from snow and practices throwing his spear. Then he tries his bow. Now, with her teeth, the woman crimps the sole of a sealskin boot she is making.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tZbMFPJc5a3jBABVUqrQky3MH0F.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
