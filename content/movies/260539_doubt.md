Cris (Andoy Ranay) is a documentary filmmaker with a well-regarded body of work and a large community of friends and admirers. Cris is also gay, and possesses a voracious sexual appetite, claiming to have had sex with over 4,000 men during his years of frequent cruising. But Cris has fallen for Eric (Paolo Gabriel), and has sworn off meaningless sex for the pleasures of monogamy. However, while Cris wants Eric and Eric alone, Eric himself isn't so sure he feels exactly the same way, and is both puzzled and annoyed with Cris' rather ironic jealousy. The tensions between the two take a heavy toll on Cris, leading to a suicide attempt, and as his friends watch from a distance, any number of them speculate on what's going on between Cris and Eric. Duda was screened at part of the 2004 New York Asian-American Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hx4YAIAVbTDs1SNk5LBFPwxsplf.jpg", "actors": ["Andoy Ranay (Cris)", "Paulo Gabriel (Erick)", "Jojo Nones ()", "Rey Pumaloy ()", "John Lapus ()", "Larry Burns ()", "Bell Clerigo ()", "Amanda Virrey ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
