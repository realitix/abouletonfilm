This movie was set in motion by a collaborative neighborhood art project (with Angelina Battais and Victoria Linhares) which was followed by the occupation of Place de la R\u00e9publique referred to as \"Nuit Debout\" that started the night of March 31st, after hours of protest under the rain.  R\u00e9publique does not cover all the converging struggles associated with living in Saint-Ouen and in the proximity of such procedures but works through the fragmented forms that were drawn from it. His aim is not to recollect and sum up all of the activities undertaken this year but stands as a remainder for future formalizations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h7o258p5yjgGzNYvkpTHqMiHe9e.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
