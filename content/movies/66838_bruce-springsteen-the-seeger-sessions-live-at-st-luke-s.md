The Boss performs songs from his new album, We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions, which consists of folk standards and spirituals popularised by the American folk legend, Pete Seeger. According to the bbc.co.uk/music album review, it's 'a fine example of a contemporary artist taking great delight in collaborating with crack musicians and mining his country's songwriting past.'
