As he listens to the old man's reminiscences of love, he thinks of his own girlfriend (both are played by Angela Molina). Eventually, the beloved eccentric's play is produced, accompanied by the boy's cello music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p0IPEiBSGdmZr2D8v6UzmiAAogV.jpg", "actors": ["Fernando Fern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez ()", "\u00c1ngela Molina ()", "Ricardo Franco ()", "Alfredo Mayo ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
