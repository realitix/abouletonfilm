Not only is something shown in this film, showing itself is shown, not only is something portrayed, portrayal itself is portrayed. A sense of space is created in a way possible only with film: seeing oneself from the front and back simultaneously, from above and below, and from outside in the center of the space. The film combines opposite parts of the space, which form the body\u00b4s imperceptible time-space continuum. Space is carried along, just like the camera.\u201d \u2013 VALIE EXPORT", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/99PXoAcibPtuI6vOZQDgyvPixDf.jpg", "actors": ["Valie Export ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
