It follows her up the stairs and into her apartment. She tries slamming the door on it, getting rid of it with a vacuum cleaner, and dumping it in someone else's shopping cart. But the cloud doesn't leave her, until she meets a young man who has his own sunshine. Is love the way she's going to get rid of her cloud? Or will change have to happen from within?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/45sziHApw5RSw3fkWkpjecCnBJ0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
