That particular love affair however does not hamper him in his pursuit of enjoyment of her simpler pleasures. For him every woman is beautiful, every wine is superior when shared with good company and every situation an opportunity for good humor. His position as School Master in a small provincial town on the island of Corfu gives him the opportunity to disseminate his own unique philosophy especially to the students that participate in his greatest passion: the choir.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n7g9lZGxdq7GZLoA70wVn3vlWxz.jpg", "actors": ["Georges Corraface (Chariton)", "Fotini Baxevani ()", "Akilas Karazisis (Dimitriou)", "Maria Nafpliotou (Eleni)", "Christos Stergioglou (Drakos)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
