The chemistry between them is electric, unrivalled in the theatre today. Russian soprano Anna Netrebko is not only beautiful but has a marvelous voice and technique; Mexican tenor Rolando Villazon, has a wonderful voice and an incredible charisma. The director not only wanted to remain steadfastly faithful to Puccini's design but also document two of the leading singers of the modern age rather than embarking on a 'trendy' contemporary re-creation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aiAPtmyFvp48wwdzAARO6EsGEhL.jpg", "actors": ["Anna Netrebko (Mim\u00ec)", "Rolando Villaz\u00f3n (Rodolfo)", "Nicole Cabell (Musetta)", "Adrian Er\u00f6d (Schaunard)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "K-gWwDYjNU4"}
