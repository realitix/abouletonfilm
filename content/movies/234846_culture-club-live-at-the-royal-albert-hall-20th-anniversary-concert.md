The show actually starts with a great joke on the audience: Boy George, looking not a day over 20, glides onstage in his once-trademark derby and beaded hair extensions, delivering a warm and welcome vocal on \"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?\" The startled crowd soon realises he's an impersonator. The real, fortysomething George O'Dowd, looking a lot less androgynous and a tad thicker than in his New Romantic days, smiles self-deprecatingly and launches into a pleasing set of white soul (\"Cold Shoulder\", \"Miss Me Blind\"), stark gospel (\"That's the Way\"), stirring raga-rock (\"Bow Down Mister\") and even a classic (a lovely cover of Bowie's \"Starman\", complete with audience participation and muscular guitar by Roy Hay). It's a fine show all around.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5krX0VlgbBe1uUdw2nDHnF8tTfd.jpg", "actors": ["Boy George ()", "Jon Moss ()", "Roy Hay ()", "Mikey Craig ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
