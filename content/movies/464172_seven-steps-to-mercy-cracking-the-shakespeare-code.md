The code reveals a treasure map where mythical objects described in the bible and controversial manuscripts are hidden. In this series of three episodes, we learn how the map functions and about the codes often hidden in Renaissance art. We discover who might have wanted to hide the treasure and how they did it and journey across the world to a tiny island in Nova Scotia in search of the treasure. We follow Amundsen and Dr Robert Crumpton, a sceptical historian, on their quest to discover the truth.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
