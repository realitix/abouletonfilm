When the dog awakes, the mouse hides in a hen's nest, and the cat disguises himself as a hen - and even does a hen imitation when the chicks hatch. The mouse then keeps pointing out the cat's hiding places, but when he points to a dump where the cat isn't hiding, the dog turns on him. The mouse paints an apple black and lights the fuse, but it explodes and sends him to mouse heaven.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qG5xLBAIaqbqMphURo7kbLsHez2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
