Davis, the company vice-president, surprisingly asks them to carry a load of merchandise to Arrowhead and offers a $1000 bonus. He tells them it is a load of lettuce. Several miles out of Los Angelese, they are stopped by a mob of lettuce-farm workers on strike. When the first crate is tossed off the truck, it explodes and the two pals learn their merchandise is a cargo of dynamite. The workers let them proceed and they crash into a car driven by Mary Stevens, whom they had met at a restaurant. She and her dog, \"Butch\" (played by a Credited dog named Stooge), join them and they deliver their cargo, and learn unscrupulous real-estate operators have jammed the locks on the dam in order to ruin the ranchers and farmers and take over their property.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lSr9D1qeO2ghvmm1qSGpHbdrneY.jpg", "actors": ["Ralph Byrd (Steve Hackett)", "Doris Weston (Mary Stevens)", "Ward Bond (Bill Purvis)", "Robert Emmett Keane (J.
