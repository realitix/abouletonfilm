Cohen uses several types of film image to add texture to the layered composition. Beautiful shades of grey, silver, black and blue echo the water, reminiscent of early photography and silverprints. Cohen says, \"The piece was constructed primarily from footage I\u2019d shot of skinnydippers at swimming holes in Georgia and rural Pennsylvania. It\u2019s about water and memory and stories just submerged. It is also, in part, a response to thinking about censorship. I would say that Drink Deep is both unabashedly and deceptively romantic. Surface, flow, and undertow. What looks like paradise is always paradise lost.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aEf4Rd9FWWjA3NCvoDk56x6Isvg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
