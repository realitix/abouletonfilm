In the 1960s, having already been a poet and a photographer, Frampton became fascinated with the possibilities of 16 mm filmmaking. In such radically playful and visually and sonically arresting works as Surface Tension, Zorns Lemma, (nostalgia), Critical Mass, and the enormous, unfinished Magellan cycle (cut short by his death at age forty-eight), Frampton repurposes cinema itself, making it into something by turns literary, mathematical, sculptural, and simply beautiful\u2014and always captivating. This collection of works by the essential artist\u2014the first release of its kind\u2014includes twenty-four films, dating from 1966 to 1979.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vy9yUXOMmgL04WG6eO5bBfEo0WF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
