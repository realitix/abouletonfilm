As a novelty, Starrett not only plays Durango and his \"alter ego\" Steve Drake, but also takes on a third identity, that of a hired gun in the employ of the film's bad guys. As one critic noted, this may be the only western in which the hero is obliged to chase himself. Jock O'Mahoney -- later known as Jock Mahoney -- plays a secondary role, and also doubles for Starrett during the riskier stunt sequences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2RFIxfEBR961Wl0Jl26iCgyAZVk.jpg", "actors": ["Charles Starrett (Steve Drake / Durango Kid)", "Smiley Burnette (Smiley Burnette)", "Lois Hall (Julia Beck)", "Jock Mahoney (Bill Beck (as Jock O'Mahoney))", "Slim Duncan (Slim Duncan)", "John Dehner (Stanton)", "George Chesebro (Kroger)", "Gregg Barton (Luke)", "Marshall Bradford (Walt Beck)", "Fred F.
