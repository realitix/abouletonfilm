Adrienne is living in New York City when she learns that the flat in Paris where she grew up (as Adrienne Markowsky) is up for sale. Looking for a key to her past, she buys the apartment and discovers a cache of letters written by her late mother. Adrienne's mother died in a Nazi concentration camp during WWII, but while she's been led to believe that her mother was betrayed while working with the resistance, the letters suggest that the truth was far more troubling. Along the way, Adrienne is romantically pursued by a young fan, William O'Hara (Josh Hamilton), though he instead finds love with Virginia Kelly (Sean Young), an American film producer eager to work with the great writer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pLaAfn6lziZiGH66ja98p4ZbVnj.jpg", "actors": ["Jeanne Moreau (Adrienne Mark)", "Sean Young (Virginia Kelly)", "Sam Waterston (Harry Bancroft)", "Christopher Cazenove (Elliott Spencer)", "Nell Carter (Millie Jackson)", "Jean-Pierre Aumont (Franz Legendre)", "Austin Pendleton (Willy Kunst)", "Charlotte de Turckheim (Judith Mark)", "Pierre Vaneck (Raymond T.K)", "Marc Tissot (Patrice Legendre)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "pP6qc3sc4II"}
