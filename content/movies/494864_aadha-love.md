The film is an unforgettable tour through the lives of five different families, who despite being the resident of the same apartment are living worlds apart, trying to untangle the threads of love and life to find meaning and contentment. This is the story of every individual, who is trying to find his/her share of love and happiness in a society, where both the things are in short supply.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3FdnDIA6PfDetFlJPDXji80bB5X.jpg", "actors": ["Biki Gurung ()", "Tika Pahari ()", "Rojisha Shahi ()", "Mithila Sharma ()", "Reecha Sharma ()", "Raymon Das Shrestha ()", "Arpan Thapa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ZcJLsklfzGs"}
