The year is 1990 and Margaret Thatcher's support within the government is wavering - her hold on the premiership hangs in the balance. Then, long-serving politician Sir Geoffrey Howe resigns over Thatcher's attitude to Europe. His resignation speech sparks a chain of events that leads to the overthrow of Britain's first woman prime minister. This modern dramatic tragedy illustrates the strengths and fatal flaws of this iconic woman more clearly than ever before and reveals how the very aspects of her character that helped her secure power are the ones that ensured her downfall. Drama starring Lindsay Duncan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1EgmJZpx7Ygiw8eDgJWr14usSWi.jpg", "actors": ["Lindsay Duncan (Margaret Thatcher)", "Ian McDiarmid (Denis Thatcher)", "Roger Allam (John Wakeham)", "Kevin McNally (Kenneth Clarke)", "Roger Ashton-Griffiths (John Sergeant)", "Michael Maloney (John Major)", "Roy Marsden (Norman Tebbit)", "Guy Henry (Tristan Garel-Jones)", "Nigel Le Vaillant (Ted Heath)", "Robert Hardy (Willie Whitelaw)", "James Fox ()", "Philip Jackson (Bernard Ingham)", "John Sessions (Ian Gow)", "Oliver Cotton (Michael Heseltine)", "Julian Firth ()", "Rosemary Leach (The Queen)", "Elizabeth Bennett (Sue Mastriforte)", "Olivia Poulet (Carol Thatcher)", "Michael Cochrane (Alan Clark)", "Dermot Crowley ()", "Nicholas Le Prevost (Douglas Hurd)", "Rupert Vansittart ()", "Tim McMullan ()", "Paul Jesson ()", "Nicholas Day ()", "Nicholas Jones (Tim Renton)", "Christian McKay (John Whittingdale)", "Charlotte Asprey (Caroline Stephens)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
