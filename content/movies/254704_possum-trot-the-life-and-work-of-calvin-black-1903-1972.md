He also built the \"Bird Cage Theater,\" where the dolls perform and sing in voices recorded by the artist. The film works on two levels. One is the documentation of the artist's legacy and commentary on women: grotesque female figures moving in the desert wind and the theater with its frozen \"actresses,\" protected by his widow from a world she views as hostile. The other is the re-creation of the artist's vision through the magic of film, as the camera enables the dolls to move and sing and brings theater to life as the artist imagined it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cQDxI29F1TGXnwn37S4bH1K48a9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
