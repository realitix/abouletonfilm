Matthew Kang, a young management consultant (Yoon) is struck by a car and sustains a serious concussion. Terminated by his employer and dumped by his vaguely leftist bohemian girlfriend, Matthew derives a wicked sense of humor from the weirdness of his own situation, and in the process slowly rediscovers himself and life's deeper meanings.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
