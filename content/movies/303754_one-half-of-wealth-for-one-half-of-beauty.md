Kristl's m\u00e9tier are borderlines. His paintings and animated films are interspersed with clear dividing lines, only for him to blur and mess them up. His graphics are scribbled over and over again until the whole surface becomes black. His oil paintings, unless someone buys them in time, are painted over and over again. He destroys any form that begins to grow. -Thomas Brandlmeier", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2mOUVNbgNbzEICfRphw0NBimOJ7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
