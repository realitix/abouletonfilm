The work is composed of two segments that are supposed to be played simultaneously: \"One 11\" contains the artistic statement, and \"103\" is a 17-part orchestral piece. Also included is a revealing documentary about Cage and director Henning Lohner.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/voLz8GkW6Ij4IrJJ7TSo6lrYard.jpg", "actors": ["John Cage ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
