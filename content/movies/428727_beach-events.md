{"tmdb_id": 428727, "title": "Beach Events", "original_title": "Beach Events", "slug_title": "beach-events", "date": "1984-01-01", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "This film completes a trilogy of landscape/poetry films, which include \u201cWaterworx\u201d (1982) and \u201cLandfall\u201d (1983), and was shot near the family home on the Northumberland Strait in Prince Edward Island. In writing the text for \u201cBeach Events,\u201d I wanted to challenge the cinema's dominant present tense by imitating primitive \u201cevent\u201d poetry, referring superficially to action present on the screen, but gradually slipping out of synchronization with its referent. This practice, together with reading a kind of sub-conscious, internal monologue (also based on the film's events, but only those past and future), helps the viewer transcend the spectacle of the present, and be aware of a larger temporal universe. In this film it informs a dialectic of internal and external nature, temporal presence and absence, the conscious and sub-conscious.
