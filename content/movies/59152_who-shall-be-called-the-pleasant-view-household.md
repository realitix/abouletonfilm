This historical documentary recreates a segment of that eventful period, focusing on the Concord years from 1889 to 1903. Much of the story is seen through the eyes of Mrs. Eddy's household, as they met challenged, grew in spiritual strength, and went about their daily activities under her guidance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6qAZMiv94mJJ1B0aCNy1MzdTwPy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
