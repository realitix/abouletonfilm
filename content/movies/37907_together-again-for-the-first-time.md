It's the first time they've all been in the same house at the same time since the parent's marriage seven years before--which wouldn't be a problem if they all liked each other. But they don't. And matters only get worse with the unexpected arrival of an ex-boyfriend, an unannounced live television broadcast, and the outing of well-kept family secrets. This is a comic, touching movie about what it means to be a family--even when you don't like each other very much", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aTpJCSvmaN4oMPxZ5i9hxu6Lrkd.jpg", "actors": ["Julia Duffy (Audrey Wolders Frobisher)", "Larisa Oleynik (Brenda)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
