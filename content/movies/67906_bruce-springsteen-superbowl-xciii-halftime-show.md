He did not really need the searchlights and the fireworks with his stalwart New Jersey troops behind him, but the extra power of 70,000 voices singing along did not hurt. 10th Avenue Freeze Out was almost a low-key opener, but once Springteen had strapped in his trademark Telecaster for Born To Run, the momentum was unstoppable. Working On A Dream, the title track of the new CD, was a nod to his stated reason for finally agreeing to do the show - \"We've got a new album out\" as he admitted last week - but a gospel choir and a stadium full of fans waving flashlights made it feel like an instant anthem anyway.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1maZCxjzNjzD4s8tohDGyiXMb3j.jpg", "actors": ["Bruce Springsteen (Himself)", "Steven Van Zandt (Himself)", "Clarence Clemons (Himself)", "Nils Lofgren (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
