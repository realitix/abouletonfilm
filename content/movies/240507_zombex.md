NOLA residents are no longer experiencing the depression and post-traumatic stress due to the trauma of the hurricane, thanks to the revolutionary ZOMBEX - a rogue, yet, \"clinically-proven\" anti-depressant pharmaceutical manufactured by a nefarious organization. For those who call the Big Easy their home, everything is just now turning around for them. Or, could it just be the drug, ZOMBEX, talking... Just as things are turning around for the city and its people, they once again must face a disaster of epic proportions. Only this time, they're dealing with the prospect of losing the people of New Orleans as they turn into the city's walking dead.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fF1EVo7li7hJhuAARYRilHgnACi.jpg", "actors": ["Lew Temple (Aldous Huxtable)", "David Christopher (Charlie Thibideaux)", "Malcolm McDowell (Dr. Soulis)", "Sid Haig (The Commander)", "Corey Feldman (Dr. Jamison)", "John Doe (Seamus O'Connor)", "Emily Kaye (Katie Ann)", "Tom Araya (Walk-away Man)", "Kinky Friedman (Staff Sgt.
