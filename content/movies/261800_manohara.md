Somasundaram. The Sivaji Ganesan-L. V. Prasad production was distinct, becoming a cult classic. Karunanidhi virtually rewrote Mudaliar\u2019s play, introducing interesting changes like the climactic sequence for which he drew inspiration from \u201cSamson and Delilah\u201d, especially the part where the blind Samson pushes the pillars down. Mu. Karunanidhi\u2019s writing was superb with a contemporary touch. His dialogue had punch, satire, wit and humour. Sivaji Ganesan was excellent in his dialogue delivery and P. Kannamba who played the queen mother was equally brilliant. Her line, \u2018Poruthathu podhum, pongi ezhu, maganey\u2019, became quite famous.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Sivaji Ganesan (Manohara)", "Girija (Princess)", "P.
