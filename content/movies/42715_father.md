Our hero (played first by D\u00e1niel Erd\u00e9ly and later, as a young man, by Andr\u00e1s B\u00e1lint) is clearly determined to find out what he can about his father who died young. All he knows is that he was a doctor and perhaps he was an honored victim of fascism. He never really finds out but his relationship with his mother, his friends and his Jewish girlfriend will make him totally independent of this need to find all about Apa or Father.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1KziDcxlrFpkg8mziqbKWeD0wE2.jpg", "actors": ["Andr\u00e1s B\u00e1lint (Tak\u00f3 Bence)", "Mikl\u00f3s G\u00e1bor (Apa)", "D\u00e1niel Erd\u00e9ly (A gyerek Tak\u00f3)", "Kati S\u00f3lyom (Anni)", "Kl\u00e1ri Tolnay (Anya)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [8776, 131586, 132136, 335202], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
