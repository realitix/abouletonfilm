On every continent, beekeepers have seen the collapse of their colonies, a phenomenon that threatens the foundations of agriculture. The Ailing Queen follows Anicet Desrochers, a young, passionate beekeeper in the Laurentian mountains of Quebec as he works through the seasons to strengthen his colonies' natural resistance and spread the word about his methods. Desrochers is a pioneer of a more ecological method of managing bees, the fields they pollinate and, ultimately, the food we live by.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
