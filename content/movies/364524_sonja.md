Being a wonder child, a star of Yugoslavian cinematography, a sex symbol, and urban legend of the eighties generation, a fighter against establishment, Sonja Savi\u0107 had always attracted attention. Simply put, she always looked, spoke and thought differently from others, she was entirely autonomous, an authentic phenomenon of Serbian culture. In the documentary SONJA, friends and colleagues of Sonja Savi\u0107 testify on many aspects of her life and work, and a special emphasis is put on Sonja\u2019s libertarian, rebellious, Don Quixote type of nature.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gVr72VgdXmNnVoV2AnaDlSJvHQm.jpg", "actors": ["Sonja Savi\u0107 (Herself (archive footage))", "Rade Serbedzija (Himself)", "Du\u0161an Kova\u010devi\u0107 (Himself)", "Dragan Nikoli\u0107 (Himself)", "Svetislav Gonci\u0107 (Himself)", "Sr\u0111an \u0110ile Markovi\u0107 (Himself)", "Milutin Petrovi\u0107 (Himself)", "Maja Weiss (Herself)", "Zoran Kosti\u0107 Cane (Himself)", "Jovan Jovanovi\u0107 (Himself)", "Nedeljko 'Ne\u0161ko' Despotovi\u0107 (Himself)", "Neboj\u0161a Pajki\u0107 (Himself)", "Stanko Crnobrnja (Himself)", "Ninoslav Ran\u0111elovi\u0107 (Himself)", "Aleksandar Gligorijevi\u0107 (Himself)", "Jan Cvitkovi\u010d (Himself)", "Drago Milinovi\u0107 (Himself)", "Petar Jakoni\u0107 (Himself)", "Georgije Mari\u0107 (Himself)", "Milo\u0161 Radivojevi\u0107 (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
