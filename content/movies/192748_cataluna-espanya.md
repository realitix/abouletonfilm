So far it seems it hasn't been found the way for Catalonia and Spain to fit together. Lack of information, ignorance and the few diffusion of the catalan reality in the rest of Spain, make it necessary, now more than ever, an effort of consideration by the civil society. The dialogue must be opened with ambitious and european prospects.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/izaQZZMoPvmy1tbstwFz3nbaVkt.jpg", "actors": ["Jos\u00e9 Alcal\u00e1 Zamora y Queipo de Llano (Himself)", "Luis Mar\u00eda Ans\u00f3n (Himself)", "Germ\u00e0 Bel (Himself)", "Alain Berset (Himself)", "Albert Boadella (Himself)", "Llu\u00eds Cabrera (Himself)", "Josep M.
