It most certainly is not a good time! Good Time is very uncomfortable, anger inducing, and depressing and I enjoyed every minute of it. Easily the highlight is the color palate with most scenes being lit by neon lights or the glow of a TV or a distant street light. As dark as the movie went tonally, seeing Robert Pattinson's face lit up by a neon red light is beautiful. Personal preference, but I'll watch a movie just for the neon lighting and Good Time uses it as a great counter to the dirty feel of everything else. The story was my least favorite part, but the acting, cinematography and score work so well that it didn't bother me that much. I say the acting it great, but really I mean that Robert Pattinson and Benny Safdie are great, everyone else is really just a way to move the plot forward and are fine (except Barkhad Abdi who just doesn't connect). If you've only seen Pattinson in the Twilight Saga (I'll admit that's the only time I've seen him) where no one acts and just recites lines with dead eyes, this is such a departure and he really delivers a believable and authentic performance. The story isn't perfect, it's got some pacing problems and a few \"Why are they doing that?\" moments, but it's a very compelling story that is just so dark and grim, but still manages to carry heart. The plot sets Pattinson as the protagonist, trying to help his mentally challenged brother after they leave home but it's really complicated whether or not you want to root for him. The ending isn't what I expected or wanted, but it is a solid ending and it works for the film. Good Time is not a movie that most people will appreciate or even want to watch if they know what it's really about, but if you can respect a fully dark and bleak film that doesn't let up it is a worthwhile film that has something to say."}], "recommandations_id": [398181, 394117, 428449, 399057], "youtube_key": "AVyGCxHZ_Ko"}
