In a wonderful mix of fiction, archival footage, processed interviews and soap opera drama, the film tells the story of Claudia Marin, a middle-class, light-skinned, lesbian Puerto Rican photographer / videographer who is attempting to construct a sense of community in the US. Confronting the simultaneity of both her privilege and her oppression, this experimental narrative becomes a meditation on class, race, and sexuality as shifting differences.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Frances Negr\u00f3n Muntaner (Claudia)", "Natalia Lazarus ()", "Zulma Gonz\u00e1lez ()", "Toni Cade Bambara ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
