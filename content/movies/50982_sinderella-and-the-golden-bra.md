Sinderella, an adopted French orphan, puts up with abuse from her stepmother and two stepsisters, and is not allowed to go to the ball. She is despondent until her inebriated fairy godfather appears and fixes her up real pretty and sends her on to the ball, with the admontion that she must return by midnight. Sinderella and the Prince get along famously, but the time flies and she leaves in a hurry, dropping her gilded support in her haste. The Prince mounts a desperate search for his loved one, requiring all the maidens of the village to try on the forgotten garment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2eOyWg1P22V7FO4joXaFZxQVeh1.jpg", "actors": ["Suzanne Sybele (Derella)", "Bill Gaskin (Prince David)", "David Duffield (King)", "Sydney Lassick (Fairy Godfather)", "Patricia Mayfield (Stepmother)", "Joan Lemmo (Fanny)", "June Faith (Flossy)", "Gerald Strickland (Adviser)", "John Bradley (First Page)", "Althea Currier (Busty Village Maiden / Lady in waiting)", "Katherine Cornwall (Village Maiden)", "Beverly Frankel (Village Maiden)", "Justine Scott (Village Maiden)", "Annette Austin (Village Maiden)", "Kay Hall (Matron)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
