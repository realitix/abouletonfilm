Witness our prehistoric ancestors as they clash with a completely different species of humans, the Neanderthals, some 30,000 years ago in Ice Age Europe. Neanderthals, stocky, powerful and able to tolerate intense pain versus their foes, the Cro-Magnons, weaker and more fragile but with a superior brain. Cutting-edge archaeological and anthropological research, including data from the ongoing Neanderthal genome mapping project at Germany's Max Planck Institute, lends up-to-the-minute realism and accuracy to this cataclysmic fight to the finish.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q9IsXMgNW3RV6uCET7wJ5JDhs68.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
