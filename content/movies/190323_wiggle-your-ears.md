Here, beloved Mary literally lets Harry Spear kick her behind, spend her money on him, and forces her to push his kiddie car, all so that she could get the occasional joy of watching Harry \"Wiggle His Ears.\" Armchair Freudians and double-entendre fans will quickly get the \"joke\" here. He quickly dumps Mary for pintsized blonde bombshell Jean Darling. What happens?
