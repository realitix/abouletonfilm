Arriving by train a few days earlier than she planned, Ellen is mistaken for Mrs. Arden, a seamstress of doubtful repute from a neighboring town. She carries on the deception for fun when her nearsighted Aunt Katie and others believe she is Mrs. Arden. Phil, her old sweetheart, recognizes her, however, and shows her his new invention, a corkscrew that turns itself--a failure because of prohibition. Ellen leaves, having heard how much store is set on her coming; she returns on the proper train, elaborately made up as Princess Delatorre, and the big reception takes place as planned. Then she and Phil return to Italy, where they expect the corkscrew to be a success.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Mary Astor (Princess Delatorre / Ellen Guthrie)", "Lloyd Hughes (Philip Lennox)", "Louise Fazenda (Aunt Katie Boyd)", "Lucien Littlefield (Uncle Joe Boyd)", "Thelma Todd (Ruby Boyd)", "Raymond McKee (Milt D'Arcy)", "Virginia Grey (Hazel Boyd)", "Aileen Manning (Aunt Meta)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
