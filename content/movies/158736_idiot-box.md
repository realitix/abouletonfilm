He meets with the Executive Director, Anekta Kapoor, and after going through various formalities - including having his Kundali/Astrological Chart approved - he is hired and instructed to increase the firm's TRP's with a good day-time soap. With all ideas already being telecast by Ekta Kapoor and Balaji Telefilms, he is at a loss and encounters writers' block. This issue resolves itself after he meets with his neighbor, Sumana Roy Chowdhury, and decides to write a story about the two of them. His work is accepted, initial episodes are telecast, and the ratings do surge upwards - but not for long - as soon Sumana finds out, confronts him, the duo find they are attracted to each other and get married. The question remains: with the two getting married, how will the show and the remainder of the episodes proceed?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vEpsYimrSAO8DSBDG5Ak2J4KP6G.jpg", "actors": ["Sushant Singh ()", "Hrishitaa Bhatt ()", "Milind Gunaji ()", "Upasna Singh ()", "Surendra Pal ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
