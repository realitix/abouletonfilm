Rocker Spyder, whose debut album was a huge hit saw his follow-on album bomb, causing him to retreat to his small hometown and give up. Seven years later, 27-year-old Spyder reconnects with his long-lost best friend and writer of his debut album Eric, son of a late great punk rock guitar legend, who has long settled into the sedate life of a suburban middle school music teacher. The reunion forces the two to recall their youthful ambitions and re-examine the choices they've made.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wff36XAWkQWNRD9pJaU9ob0zGdr.jpg", "actors": ["Kevin Zegers (Spyder)", "Jason Ritter (Eric Genson)", "Taryn Manning (Rose Atropos)", "Lukas Haas (Clifton Hangar)", "Max Rosenbaum (Little Girl)", "Aimee Teegarden (Annie Genson)", "Billy Morrison (Fashion Jones)", "Lauren Holly (Liza Genson)", "James Ransone (Chip Genson)", "Peter Fonda (August West)", "Billy Dee Williams (Ace Millstone)", "Ruby Dee (Miss Candy)", "Kelly Lynch (Maggie)", "Debra Mayer (Heidi (uncredited))", "Keren Gilbert (Teacher)", "Craig Snitkoff (Young Eric Genson)", "Michael Jeremiah (Hawks Lead Singer)", "Ron 'Bumblefoot' Thal (Hawks Guitarist)", "Alan Gary (Hawks Drummer)", "Chris Kiszka (Hawks Manager)", "Jasin Cadic (Bixx the Bass Player)", "Marty Erspamer (Bonzo the Drummer)", "Danielle Simone (Charlie)", "Michael Kenneth Williams (Sonnyboy)", "Chazz Menendez (Warren)", "Eileen Alana (Warren's Girl)", "Bobbi Jo Kitchen (Bobbi-Jo)", "Angelina Aucello (Drummer's Girlfriend (uncredited))", "Brooke Bickford (Club Attendee (uncredited))", "Courtney Charles (Blues Club Patron (uncredited))", "Aristedes Philip DuVal (Club Attendee (uncredited))", "Daniel Fainman (Punk Kid (uncredited))", "Sharon Juchniewicz (Mechanical Bull Rider (uncredited))", "Tanzeel Kayani (Rock Fan (uncredited))", "Meghan Keeler (Rocker Girl in Bar (uncredited))", "Marca Leigh (Band Groupie (uncredited))", "Joseph Longo (Ray (uncredited))", "Eve Lora (Rock Fan (uncredited))", "Jeanette Lutz (Rocker Girl in Bar (uncredited))", "Shane Lynch (Party Girl (uncredited))", "Chris Miskiewicz (Rocker (uncredited))", "Tara Erica Moore (Party Girl (uncredited))", "Danny Pennacchi (Rocker (uncredited))", "Jimmie Pinckney (Party Guy #2 (uncredited))", "Vincent James Russo (90's Grunge Rocker (uncredited))", "Usman Sharif (Party Guy #1 (uncredited))", "Uzimann (Floor Dancer (uncredited))", "Todd Travis Warrick (Club Attendee (uncredited))", "Adrain Washington (Tyson (uncredited))", "Deantre Williams (Bar Patron (uncredited))", "Anna Kuchma (Band Groupie (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
