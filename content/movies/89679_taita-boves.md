It tells the true story of Jose Tom\u00e1s Boves, a cruel man who became a legend during the Venezuelan War of Independence, the most violent in the Americas. He went from seafarer to pirate, horse smuggler to prosperous merchant, prisoner to military chief. Spanish by birth, he spearheaded a grass roots troop of slaves, mulattoes, Indians and mestizos that crushed Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar and his patriot army. Respectfully referred to as \"Taita\" by them, he fought for the underprivileged and the poorest of the poor, and curtailed three centuries of order in this colonial region. This film is about his passions and power, his loves and misadventures, and a bloody saga that rocked Venezuela.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lCtQaHPT2MBZDPno6Pyv4eWrXIE.jpg", "actors": ["Luis Abreu (Juan Palacios)", "Alberto Alifa (Juez Brice\u00f1o)", "Daniela Alvarado (In\u00e9s)", "Wilfredo Cisneros (Padre Llamozas)", "Juvel Vielma (Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s Boves)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
