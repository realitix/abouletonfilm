A man seated on the steps is approached by two men, costumed as frock-coated, stovepipe-hatted politicians who ask for and receive money. Soon a person dressed in a tiger skin appears and chases the three men away and then mounts the stairs and acts as if he were monarch of all he surveys.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
