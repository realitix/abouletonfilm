The two contrarians laugh, confide and argue, in public and in private, as they journey through three cities. And the film captures it all. The result is a magnetic conflict, a character-driven narrative that sparkles cinematically with a perfect match of arresting personalities and intellectual rivalry. COLLISION is directed by prolific independent filmmaker Darren Doane (Van Morrison: Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl, The Battle For L.A., Godmoney).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/unP1LnMctWbJpU4gccMUefmErbd.jpg", "actors": ["Douglas Wilson (Himself)", "Christopher Hitchens (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [36609], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
