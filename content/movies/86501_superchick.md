True is a flight attendant who makes a weekly swing through New York, Miami, and Los Angeles. In each city, she has a man: Edward, older and wealthy; Johnny, a beach bum with gambling debts; and, Davey, a rock musician on the cusp of success. Tara is a free spirit, faithful to each man in her own way, and so stunning that she dresses in a wig and ill-fitting uniform while she's working so men won't harass her constantly. The low-life whom Johnny is in debt to figures out a way to use Tara to help him execute a daring in-flight robbery. But will Tara stand by helplessly, or is superchick ready for action?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eZ850EYplyvesaPHxfoTtoYnB1R.jpg", "actors": ["Joyce Jillson (Superchick)", "Louis Quinn (Garrick)", "Thomas Reardon (Ernest)", "Tony Young (Johnny)", "Timothy Wayne Brown (Davy Charles)", "John Carradine (Igor Smith)", "Uschi Digard (Mayday)", "Junero Jennings (Sims)", "Steve Drexel (Pete)", "James Carroll Jordan (Marine)", "Phil Hoover (Tommy Hooks)", "Marland Proctor (Co-Pilot)", "Flo Lawrence (Party Girl (as Flo Gerrish))", "Candy Samples (Lady on Boat (as Mary Gavin))", "Myron Griffith (Nudie Producer)", "Rick Cassidy (Dungeon Master on Movie Set (uncredited))", "Dan Haggerty (Biker with Bandana (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [90342, 47345, 28676], "youtube_key": "owmRNoiPxHo"}
