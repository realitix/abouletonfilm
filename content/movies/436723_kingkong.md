The disintegration of the initial material (the windowed fa\u00e7ade of a building), which resembles a chemical process, produces the colors violet, light blue and white and dissects the urban vocabulary of forms. The dispersion of the big city\u00b4s lights carries over to the structure of time and space and ceases to conjure up an external danger. Instead, the viewer is confronted with sound and images which decompose the personal criteria employed in sensory perception.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cd0kCObyOlifjfoVNtprQeJCfNg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
