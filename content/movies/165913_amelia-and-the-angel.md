The painter ascends a ladder until he is out of shot - supposedly to heaven-and reappears to restore Amelia's joy with a pair of wings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d7dwzaYJwVNTl7OvFzB4jrck5Eq.jpg", "actors": ["Mercedes Quadros (Amelia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
