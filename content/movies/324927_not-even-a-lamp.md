'Abdu'l-Baha spoke of a day when the Bab's resting place and the entire mountain surrounding it would bask in the glow of thousands of lights. The 200 lights illuminating the new terrace gardens are symbolic of His Triumph over his adversaries and the spread of His cause throughout the world.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
