Rallies, sportscar racing, motorcycle road racing, motocross, single seaters, a caravan Destruction Derby (!), snow-scooters and European Rally Cross Championship are all featured in some not so glorious but often gloriously funny moments. And to cap it all, there's a very special dose of stuntmania running throughout. Even if you've never visited a powersport event you're sure to find Havoc 8 rivetting, funny, shocking and above all compulsive viewing!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gmwL7oVSeeUGefMu3OLRdhBT9BY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
