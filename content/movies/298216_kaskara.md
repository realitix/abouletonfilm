The place shown is a part of a house in the country. Doors and windows are continually shown, emphasizing the film's concern with framing. Other images are present: city-scapes of a particularly sinister nature, implying a sense of ruin, and shots of a chorus on a stage. These shots begin and end the film which is accompanied by a vocal chant on the soundtrack.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fd2r1uqTAUoDrLYRcwMcZl9iSGR.jpg", "actors": ["Werner Nekes ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
