This caused a wedge to open up between the two halves, which reached a maximum of about two feet at the peak of the roof. He then sawed off the four top corners of the house, which are now the only remnants of the project. The rest of the house was demolished soon after Splitting.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
