Movie Maker Tom Hovinb\u00f8le has from the start in 2001 interviewed a number of artists in the noise genre. The artists relay their thoughts on the phenomenon of noise music - what is it, where does it come from, what is the trade off when replacing traditional harmony and melody for pure audio experience, which possibilities can be explored?  The movie explains the historical context of the genre, from the movement of Futurism and Luigi Russolo from before WWI to electronic experiments in the fifties, avantgarde in the sixties, industry and punk in the seventies to the final establishment of the noise genre at the end of the seventies in Japan. Adding to the flavour are concert performances.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zxW38ei20mL5XtvmakRF6QGGVOn.jpg", "actors": ["Masami Akita (Merzbow)", "Tore Honor\u00e9 B\u00f8e (Himself)", "David Cotner (Himself)", "Lasse Marhaug (Himself)", "Toshimaru Nakamura (Himself)", "Asbj\u00f8rn Fl\u00f8 (Himself)", "Maja Ratkje (Herself)", "Kjell Runar Jenssen (Himself)", "Helge Sten (Himself)", "Otomo Yoshihide (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
