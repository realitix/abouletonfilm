Based on the model of a natural woodland, a forest garden incorporates a wide variety of useful plants, including fruit and nut trees, perennial herbs, and vegetables. Robert Hart blends history, philosophy, anthropology, and seasonal gardening wisdom, which together comprise a remarkable testament to the pleasures of \"hands-off\" as well as hands-on gardening.  Practical features include:  Design guidelines for creating your own perennial food-producing garden\r Lists of recommended plants and varieties,\r An explanation of how plants in different levels or \"stories\" --from ground covers to full-sized trees--coexist and interact in a healthy and productive landscape.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3XjNGN32yrtTkAAcmQ8dAfp5brb.jpg", "actors": ["Julia Guerra (Themself)", "Ken Fern (Themself)", "Mike Guerra (Themself)", "Robert Hart (Themself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
