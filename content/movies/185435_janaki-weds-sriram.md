With some needed twists that lend a feel-good touch, apart from a love triangle, the movie makes a bid to impress the audience. Director Sreenu, who has had some directorial experience before, takes the credit for shaping the story in such a way that it looks different. The film can be termed musical, for it deals with lots of inter-college music competitions. -- Jeevi @ Idlebrain.com", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hdb13Gqng2fRFXR5xIj2ONnl4sW.jpg", "actors": ["Gajala ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
