Lucia and her little daughter Marussia are two such people. They have been thrown out by the Russian acquaintances they were staying with and must tramp the streets with their trolley suitcases searching for somewhere else to live. A Russian Orthodox priest offers them their first night's shelter. They spend the second night in a homeless hostel and party through the third with a chance acquaintance. On the fourth night they sleep clandestinely in a cinema and on the fifth with a Russian artist in a hotel \u2026 Lucia is good-looking, dresses elegantly and is certainly not shy of men. This serves the mother and her daughter well. In spite of all the uncertainties in their lives, the two frequently share tender moments.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g0ZMR403jJtTOI29oOVrl5PB8S8.jpg", "actors": ["Dinara Drukarova (Lucia)", "Marie-Isabelle Shteynman (Marussia)", "Dounia Sichov (Anna)", "George Babluani (Claudio)", "Alexei Ageev (Aleksey)", "Madalina Constantin (Tatiana)", "Denis Lavant (Clochard)", "\u0160ar\u016bnas Bartas (Dimitri)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
