He\u2019s now got Will Ospreay tonight, and Havoc\u2019s taken exception to Will\u2019s comments\u2026 so he\u2019s decided to go all Dexter and tie someone to a table with cling film so he can murder them.  The innocent victim\u2019s face is covered with Havoc\u2019s title belt, and Jimmy asks us \u201cif you think I\u2019m doing this for fun, what do you think I\u2019ll do to someone I hate?\u201d. Cue stabbings\u2026 and if you\u2019re worried, of course it wasn\u2019t real. Tom Irvin (who was under the belt) survived.  We start with a tag title match, but it\u2019s not a tag match, as FSU faced each other for \u201csole ownership\u201d of the tag titles. I\u2019m not too sure what made FSU turn on each other, but there you go\u2026 before we can get going, the lights go out, and out come the Faceless through the crowd and attack FSU.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
