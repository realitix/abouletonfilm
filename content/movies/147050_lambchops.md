Turns out, they're looking for the audience, and when George spots the camera, they start in on their patter. Gracie wants to convince George that she's smart, not dizzy - it's an uphill struggle of which she's blissfully unaware. Midway through, they break into song: \"Do You Believe Me?\" It includes a little bit of hoofing as the chatting continues. They end on a story Gracie whispers into George's ear.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/upQByEwY58sHWdL3RZm7kmRc44s.jpg", "actors": ["George Burns (George the boyfriend)", "Gracie Allen (Gracie the girlfriend)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [383841, 189696, 285768, 154525], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
