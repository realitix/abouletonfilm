When Far Eastern fishermen save him, it soon becomes clear his memory is in a paradoxical state: he has total amnesia concerning his own past, even his real name, but has more factual knowledge stored in his brain then even the Google computer banks on every possible other subject, as if he had memorized the Library of Congress, so one rarely needs to read anything when he's around. He also is intelligent and inquisitive enough to understand and use much of that knowledge, and keeps rolling into all kinds of weird mysteries, teaming up with various characters, each of which must first be convinced he's legit, such as police detectives Frank Hayes and Jamie Avery", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9NyMWb7Xt3Y0vtEcICMdpCaWYfv.jpg", "actors": ["Dominic Purcell (John Doe)", "Jayne Brook (Jamie Avery)", "John Marshall Jones (Frank Hayes)", "Sprague Grayden (Karen Kawalski)", "William Forsythe (Digger)", "Romy Rosemont (Mrs. Nichols)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
