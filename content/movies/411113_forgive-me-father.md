From guilt ridden teacher Nick Capra who fals in love with troubled, young student Armond Rizzo, to former priest Lance Hart who left the church when his desire for parishioner Tommy Defendi became too much to bear. We also find devoted husband Trenton Ducati plagued by shameful lust for his hot young brother in law Seth Santoro, and young swaggering soldier Ty Roderick who unexpectedly falls for 'pretty boy' Casey Tanner. Real sex, real positions, real orgasms, no dissolves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3ovxK0E6de6Q00wq1pTYL10yLnQ.jpg", "actors": ["Armond Rizzo ()", "Casey Tanner ()", "Lance Hart ()", "Nick Capra ()", "Seth Santoro ()", "Tommy Defendi ()", "Trenton Ducati ()", "Ty Roderick ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
