Her grandmother is partially unable to move, and Shizuru has to care for her with her mother, who tries to keep Shizuru shackled at every opportunity. Shizuru\u2019s days are filled with endless monotony.  She works as a receptionist at her former classmate\u2019s hospital, and one day goes to buy picture books for the waiting room. It\u2019s then that she recalls a book from her childhood \u2018The Pierrot Prays to the Moon\u2019.  Wanting to read the book again, Shizuru finds it on an online auction site. Once it finally arrives and she begins to read it, a small slip of paper gently falls from its pages. On the paper are what appear to be instructions for a recipe. The recipe prompts Shizuru to contact Tobuse (Shosuke Tanihara), the man who sent her the book.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v1vVj00k37nRwamqCI1atNRBaRH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
