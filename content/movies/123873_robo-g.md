Just before they are due to present their invention, the robot is destroyed in a freak accident. With little time left, the three are forced to go for the last resort: Build a hollow robot suit and put a human being in it. After an audition, the only qualified man for the job is Suzuki, a cranky and lonely retiree who needs the job to kill time. After a public display that puts the robot on the headlines, the three engineers are forced to drag Suzuki on a publicity tour in order to keep up their fa\u00e7ade. However, their plans are complicated when passionate robotics student Yoko is thrown into the mix.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7CpYFdxGqeRbG2IHTM1DFtD1bnU.jpg", "actors": ["Yuriko Yoshitaka ()", "Gaku Hamada ()", "Junya Kawashima ()", "Mickey Curtis ()", "Tomoko Tabata ()", "Takehiko Ono ()", "Emi Wakui ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [94054, 252738], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
