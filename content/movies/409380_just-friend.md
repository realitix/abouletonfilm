He's a polite and quiet boy, and the local students always make fun of him just because he's from Bangkok. He later becomes friend with Oud, a local bad-boy who is really a good guy inside. Just like any other teenagers, Min falls in love at first sight with Fang, a pretty girl from the same school, but this love is going to be tough because of the opposition of Fang's father.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/waY3qFJkbIa3bu3dHKE7LC0RY5G.jpg", "actors": ["Phrompon Sithimongkol (Min)", "Thanamit Reuanghiran (Oud)", "Kanokwan Thananchai (Fang)", "Apichart Chusakul (Fang's Dad)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
