Portions of the video were shot in Zhuji, China, home to gargantuan pearl-making facilities, but the rest was staged and recorded in New York on a custom-designed set. As with all of Rottenberg\u2019s work, women serve as both protagonists and catalysts: the women seen here do strange things that make other strange things happen, to themselves and others, which in turn make even more strange things happen. The video as a whole is a kind of assembly line of cause and effect, reaction and response, all of which result in the production and harvesting of cultured pearls.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
