But if word were to get around that the \"Madama\" is Vito (Christian De Sica) they might even start to like the guy.  Vito is a funny sort of a cop.  For a start he doesn't like the uniform (he never wears it).  Things might even go smoothly for him, if it weren't for an incredible number of beautiful girls who always manage to get in his way.  Especially one girl Angelo (shouldn't that have been Angela?  No, the girl's name really is Angelo).  Problems arise too, with his direct supervisor, who also happens to be a relative.  But Vito puts up with it all and manages to stay his usual calm and polite self, even when he risks getting killed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/saVsYTeLz6C2GYL6wMseZhbcquw.jpg", "actors": ["Christian De Sica (Vito Militiello)", "Carole Andr\u00e9 ()", "Tom Skerritt (Jack)", "Ines Pellegrini (Irma)", "Oreste Lionello (Inspector Solmi)", "Ettore Manni (Sante Tonnaro)", "Gigi Ballista (The Venetian)", "Francesco De Rosa (Squillace)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
