A bit of an odd character, Triangle Woman has kept these stories locked up in her head for many years. The film includes stories about a man whose finger rapidly deteriorates and the impending consequences; a nice lady who really isn't that nice; an old woman who talks backwards; an employment agency that has a man-toy named Mr. Brombellarella; among other stories. Triangle Woman is the thread that binds all of the stories together, and she imprints her bizarreness throughout the entire film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6t1pRT99qbUTShBhdVWdoUfKcL0.jpg", "actors": ["Vivian Jimenez Hall (Triangle Woman)", "Richard D.
