The video beautifully weaves personal images and audio recordings of a very intimate nature, binding the personal with the political.  Reading aloud from letters sent by her mother in Beirut, Hatoum creates a visual montage reflecting her feelings of separation and isolation from her Palestinian family. The personal and political are inextricably bound in a narrative that explores personal and family identity against a backdrop of traumatic social rupture, exile and displacement.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lL8eiILJZ4JD7bc6IQdGQWO3mHW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
