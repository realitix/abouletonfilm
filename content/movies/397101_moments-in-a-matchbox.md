The kids are traveling to the countryside together. They get to two of Aneta's grandparents - one of her grandmothers was married three times. Aneta's favorite grandfather is her grandmother's third husband. He is not her real grandfather, but she loves him because he likes to fantasize. He taught Aneta a magic game - to light a match and imagine anything in flame. Her favorite grandfather dies. Aneta mourns him for a long time, lights matches but no use.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gkkE0h7pwY87MYbXyWEkFPZpBKa.jpg", "actors": ["Violeta Doneva (Maykata na Aneta)", "Dossio Dossev (Lyubimiyat dyado)", "Leda Taseva (Babata)", "Stefan Danailov (Kvartirantat)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
