The killer is caught in a moral downhill spiral with his ruthlessness increasing with every crime he commits. Meanwhile, the mother and children of the family he is living with are trapped by their conditions but refuse to give in to them. The characters seem like fragmented reflections of Iraq as it negotiates its traumas of wars and corruption, and a very uncertain future.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wBAypw0MA7e9tXEmBm8mdDotv4q.jpg", "actors": ["Asaad Abdul Majeed (Hitman)", "Alaa Najem (Kerima)", "Hattam Auda (Salih)", "Hayder Munather (Taleb)", "Rawan Abdullah (Meriam)", "Sajad Ali (Muhanad)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
