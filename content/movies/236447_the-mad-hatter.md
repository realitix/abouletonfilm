We watch her dashing to work, then sitting through a typical day, reading novels and eating candy. But that's all prelude, as she lives to shop, particularly for hats. She tries on a wide variety of hats, but her heart is set on #36, which she's told must be special ordered.

Number 36 is let out long enough to whip one up for Maisie.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fWfQKIvq72ss4IyrkTiJgrLSgag.jpg", "actors": ["Mel Blanc (Various Characters)", "John Wald (Various Characters)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
