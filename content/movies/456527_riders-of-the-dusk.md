Since the studio couldn't build an entire film around Wilson's bullwhip prowess, a plot was called for. This time around, it's the one about a U.S. marshal who searches high and low for a mysterious masked desperado. The mystery angle is minimal, since seasoned movie fans will be able to determine the mystery person's identity within 15 minutes. As always, Andy Clyde is a tower of comic strength as Whip Wilson's grizzled old sidekick.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oJOomO1szkaBjuU0BoooELzbMzH.jpg", "actors": ["Whip Wilson (Marshal Whip Wilson)", "Andy Clyde (Winks Holliday)", "Reno Browne (Nora Neal)", "Tris Coffin (J.J.
