Unsure of where she is going, she climbs into her old convertible for a trip through the desert. Along the way she meets a series of bizarre characters, including two dancing glitter girls, a crazy jogger and a heartbreaking crooner. Anna's friends and family also appear repeatedly to her in her car for imaginary conversations.
