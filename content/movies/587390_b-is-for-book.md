Some of them make a flying start, but others struggle even with the alphabet. The film takes us into their home lives, where we find that some parents are strongly aspirational, tutoring children late into the night, while others speak English as a foreign language, if at all.  As the children master the basics, they discover the magical world of stories and look with fresh eyes at the world around them. The film gives us privileged access to a profound process that all of us only ever do once in our lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pKl1ww86cvci0sEZCz0GefAQb2w.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "VK5BUKfQtZs"}
