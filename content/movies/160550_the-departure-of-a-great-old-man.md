Tolstoy must explain to them that it is his wife who has authority over their land-holdings, and she will not help them. Stung by their negative reaction to him, Tolstoy becomes increasingly preoccupied with the problems of the poor. This leads to a number of conflicts with his wife, and then to a deep despondency, as the noted writer continues vainly to search for answers to the sufferings he sees around him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8EObCy3jCmdqfvsA7fulDhiCvGI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
