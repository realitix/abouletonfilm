Four women have suffered the loss of their missionary husbands at the hands of some Native Americans along the Amazon. Now the four are making a pilgrimage to the site of the murders to pay homage to their spouses and participate in a reunion of various church groups. A journalist tags along for the story and interviews each woman in turn in order to gather background on their husbands. But when someone shows up who witnessed the deaths, the truth sends one grieving wife over the edge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5ec5B2y2iMIYRBkyTdDGCYfoOBp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
