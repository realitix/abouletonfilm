But soon she sees that her people\u2019s traditional way of life- fishing, trapping, and hunting these fragile wetlands\u2013 is threatened by a cycle of man-made environmental crises. As Louisiana is devastated by Hurricane Katrina and Rita and then the BP oil leak, Monique finds herself turning to environmental activism. She documents her family\u2019s struggle to stay close to the land despite the cycle of disasters and the rapidly disappearing coastline. The film looks at the complex and uneven relationship between the oil industry and the indigenous community of the Mississippi Delta. In this intimate documentary portrait, Monique must overcome the loss of her house, her father, and her partner \u2013 and redefine the meaning of home. Her story is both unique and frighteningly familiar.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5lt7VAeA9CajbstzDtPBPesP8V5.jpg", "actors": ["Monique Verdin (Herself)", "Mark Krasnoff (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "94VKgb1Cloc"}
