{"tmdb_id": 412546, "title": "Antrum", "original_title": "Antrum", "slug_title": "antrum", "date": "2019-11-01", "genre": ["Horreur"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "Antrum was shot sometime in the late 1970's most likely somewhere in Southern California. Many people in the cinephile community believe Antrum is cursed, since it was closely tied with a number of disturbing incidents that had occurred in both the US and Eastern Europe throughout the 1980's. Namely, a number of people have died, or been seriously injured during or shortly after watching this film. As a result of these incidents Antrum disappeared, or was deliberately buried by people who were apprehensive about its continued screening. This latest release of Antrum has been re-titled because it is preceded by a 15-minute documentary before the original, un-altered version of the film begins.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nfRmWnh9nXxr8elylCJz8UgwzfV.jpg", "actors": ["Nicole Tompkins (Oralee)", "Rowan Smyth (Nathan)", "Dan Istrate (Cassius)", "Circus-Szalewski (Hanzie)", "Kristen Elling (Mother)", "Shu Sakimoto (Haruki)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "D7iOj9sPhM4"}
