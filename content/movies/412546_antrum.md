In 1988, a movie theatre in Budapest that was screening the film burnt to the ground, killing the 56 people who were in attendance. This incident follows the inexplicable deaths of a number of film festival programmers that had received Antrum as a submission and died shortly after watching it. These events have created a belief that watching Antrum will kill you. Else Films has successfully tracked down a sole copy of the film and packaged it for public release. The film is about a young boy and girl that enter a forest and dig a hole to hell. As one programmer observed of Antrum, \u201cYou don\u2019t watch the film, the film watches you\u201d.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nfRmWnh9nXxr8elylCJz8UgwzfV.jpg", "actors": ["Nicole Tompkins (Oralee)", "Rowan Smyth (Nathan)", "Dan Istrate (Cassius)", "Circus-Szalewski (Hanzie)", "Kristen Elling (Mother)", "Shu Sakimoto (Haruki)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
