At the Op\u00e9ra Comique its plot is transported to the time of the works creation with Frances military expeditions to Algeria. It is staged by a first-rate creative team: Stage director Denis Podalyd\u00e8s and costume designer Christian Lacroix provide stunning visuals, whilst conductor Louis Langr\u00e9e leads the Orchestre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, the Chur Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments and a stellar cast of soloists in this delightful fools game. Mezzo-soprano Ga\u00eblle Arquez shines with her superlative technique (Le Monde) and Julie Fuchss Ad\u00e8le performance elicits more than just admiration, namely enthusiasm in the etymological sense of the word: inspired by the divine (Le Monde). A masterpiece! (T\u00e9l\u00e9rama), Pure pleasure! (Les \u00c9chos). Le Comte Ory at the Op\u00e9ra Comique is a true musical and theatrical celebration where everything sparkles!
