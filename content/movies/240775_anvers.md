Together with his wife, Jasmijn, and their one year-old child, they are forced to move in with Jasmijn\u2019s parents in their flat in Antwerp on a temporary basis\u2019. The love between Martin and Jasmijn rapidly deteriorates. Martin seems to be living in a world of his own and refuses to lower himself into signing on at the employment office. He wanders through town and hangs round near the flat where they used to live. He finds a happy family there. Martin can\u2019t accept that they have the happiness that he couldn\u2019t have and decides to destroy their happiness just like his happiness was destroyed \u2013 in his view.
