The main merit is the phenomenal ballet score by Tchaikovsky,(all three ballets are just timeless, and I never tire of them) and I will say that I love the story by ETA Hoffmann, it is just a magical story and perfect for a Christmas tradition. There is also some fantastic choreography, especially seen in the Pax De Deux, and the scenery is dazzling. The dancing was superb; I was most impressed with the ballerina Natalya Arkhipova, a beautiful woman of wonderfully flexible technique. Everyone else was excellent as well, the Prince was handsome, the Mouse King was scary and Droselmeyer is certainly mysterious enough. All in all, a dazzling and perfectly charming production, with a wonderful performance from the ballerina, and choreography to die for.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5Dx8CKJ31lFVy2biOCNvd11ChCh.jpg", "actors": ["Natalya Arkhipova (Clara)", "Marina Lazareva (Fritz)", "Ilse Liepa (Mrs. Stahlbaum)", "Irek Mukhamedov (The Nutcracker Prince)", "Larisa Okhotnikova (The Nutcracker Doll)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
