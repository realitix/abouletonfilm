It presents, with some inevitable, tiny technical shortcomings, a live 1980 performance in Central Park, not the 1983 movie of the same name that also starred Linda Ronstadt and Kevin Kline. Those who remember that film, which had the benefit of retakes and editing, a lavish production budget, and the spaciousness of a Hollywood studio, may find this video less polished. On its own terms, it is nonetheless thoroughly enjoyable.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dmJ2Y1erCiKJetRzjTUeqV5vtaW.jpg", "actors": ["Kevin Kline (Pirate King)", "Linda Ronstadt (Mabel)", "Rex Smith (Frederic)", "Patricia Routledge (Ruth)", "Tony Azito (Sergeant)", "George Rose (General Stanley)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
