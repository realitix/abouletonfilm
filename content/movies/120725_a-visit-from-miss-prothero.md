He lives alone except for his budgie and memories of his late wife Winnie. One afternoon his nap is interrupted by the doorbell; his former secretary, Peggy Prothero, has come to visit. A brash, charmless woman who seems to take no pleasure in anything but putting people down, Miss Prothero wants to fill her old boss in on all the changes that have taken place at work since he left. Dodsworth isn't very curious, and as the visit wears on it puts a little strain on his politeness and patience. Miss Prothero doesn't enjoy it much either, but lingers on as there's a bombshell she wants to drop. The docketing system Dodsworth introduced thirty years earlier, which revolutionised the firm, has been scrapped by her adored new boss Mr Skinner. The crowning achievement of Dodsworth's career has just become obsolete, and she wants to tell him all about it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xaAna0pYsZI6KwVfif4Gxm9J0aH.jpg", "actors": ["Patricia Routledge (Miss Prothero)", "Hugh Lloyd (Arthur Dodsworth)", "Alan Bennett (Narrator (Voice Only))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
