At the center of the story is Agnes Baltsa, whose smoky mezzo is tailor-made for the gypsy Carmen, an independent woman who glories in obeying only her own rules, but who is haunted by fate. Superstar tenor Jos\u00e9 Carreras is Don Jos\u00e9, the solider from a small town who catches Carmen\u2019s eye and is destroyed by his growing obsession with her. Samuel Ramey is the charismatic matador Escamillo, who lures Carmen away from Don Jos\u00e9 with tragic result. Leona Mitchell is Mica\u00ebla, the simple girl from Don Jos\u00e9\u2019s hometown who cannot save him.
