A corrupt cop is more interested in the money on the criminals he catches than justice; a young woman discovers she's pregnant, and her boyfriend is unfeeling; and a young man calls a prostitute it's the first time for both, and neither can go through with it. Ultimately, all the stories come together.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mPWj3LxoRXWJ2gEDXPKqopshdkU.jpg", "actors": ["Sarah Wentworth (Rachel)", "Jeffrey Schecter (Clark)", "Tony Denison (John)", "Ricco Ross (Clint)", "Jeff Wadlow (Derek)", "Elizabeth Anne Allen (Katie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
