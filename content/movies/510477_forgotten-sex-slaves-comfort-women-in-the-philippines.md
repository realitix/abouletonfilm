Some of them were still teenagers. They were raped, often beaten and abused. The Japanese called them \u201cianfu\u201d or Comfort Women. After the war the survivors struggled to continue with their lives, hiding what many considered to be a \u201cshame\u201d. After having been silent for more than 50 years they have started to tell their stories. Until today, they are waiting for an adequate compensation and official acknowledgment of their victimization. They are in their Eighties and Nineties now and time is running out for them. This intimate, touching film tells the story of nine comfort women in the Philippines and follows their efforts to find justice before they die.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yxGRimhbENaoJGG31ofSS7Xng2L.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
