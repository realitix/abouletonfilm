In October 2005, five young people were kidnapped in the Highlands of Scotland by the militant Real Animal League. Stripped and abandoned in the wilderness, never for one moment did the friends know what was coming to them. What followed was a harrowing game of cat and mouse as their weekend retreat became a deadly case of live or die. Combining dramatic reconstruction, real footage from the Real Animal League's archives and compelling interviews with the survivors of the ordeal, BLOODED finally tells the true story behind one of the most extreme internet virals of modern times. A must see!
