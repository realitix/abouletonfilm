If you were to judge the film by its cover, you might think it was some kind of mix of Revenge of the Nerds and Hardbodies, but the truth couldn\u2019t be further from that. Instead you get something more like a Southern fried American Graffiti meets Porky's lite.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9XmW8Z2RQaRwSaQqHLzHes3ZG0s.jpg", "actors": ["John Aschenbrenner ()", "Dan Byrd ()", "Della Cole ()", "Tony Freeman ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
