These are images which do not portray a process but are themselves part of a process. As early as the Eighties, cruise missiles used a stored image of a real landscape then took an actual image during flight, the software compared the two images. A comparison between idea and reality, a confrontation between pure war and the impurity of the actual. This confrontation is also a montage and montage is always about similarity and difference. Many operational images show coloured guidance lines, intended to portray the work of recognition. The lines tell us emphatically what is all important in these images, and just as emphatically what is of no importance at all. Superfluous reality is denied \u2013 a constant denial provoking opposition.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qYs2tWXyiyFnPV7k98Mu5HZ7nur.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
