Not content to stand idly by as evil walks their halls, the Sisters decide to take action. Confronted by the nuns about his wicked ways, the priest retaliates. For defying him, the Father takes the Sisters hostage and bricks them into the walls of the school's basement. The sadistic and fatal punishment shakes the faith of the women, forcing them to renounce their holy vows in the moments before their demise. How could they continue to believe in a power that would allow them to suffer such a fate when they were merely trying to do what's right? Decades later, the school is now vacated and in a state of disrepair. Selected by the community as a building marked for urban renewal, a neighborhood youth group has volunteered their afternoon to come clean up the premises and prepare it for construction.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f9XwuQMHJeocoa7DQflkc2wbulg.jpg", "actors": ["Anna Rizzo (Kat)", "Jamie Lyn Bagley (Meredith)", "Sean Leser (Halsey)", "Monica Saviolakis (Sister Millicent)", "Samantha Acampora (Sister Irene)", "Sarah Nicklin (Claudette)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
