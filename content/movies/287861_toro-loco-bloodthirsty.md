Upon arriving in a new town he finds himself trapped in a city drowning in chaos, its people firmly in the grasp of a ruthless crime boss peddling the mind-bending drug, \"El Ultimo Aire.\" This man is a legend, a hit man, the killer of killers and the people call him \"Toro Loco.\" He fights punks, crack-heads and tough guys with his trademark shooter, a Smith & Wesson 34-1, but you take that away from him and it doesn't matter. Toro Loco has another deadly weapon: his hands! Toro Loco is here and the first to die are the fucking lucky ones!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s5AzXkP7XjN9toEQZqTqEZtXa4l.jpg", "actors": ["Francisco Melo (Toro Loco)", "Mauricio Pesutic (Baldemar)", "Simon Pesutic (Jano)", "Constanza Piccoli (Siboney Lo)", "Serge Fran\u00e7ois Soto (El Italiano /Abuelo)", "Daniel Antivilo (El viejo pastero)", "Mat\u00edas L\u00f3pez (Danilo Porrasito)", "Ignacio Mu\u00f1oz (Lady Caca)", "Felipe Avello (Mateo)", "Patricio Valladares (Luchador MMA)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
