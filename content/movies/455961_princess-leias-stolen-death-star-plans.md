Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band a week later, June 1. Our new album merges both into one full-length concept album titled Princess Leia\u2019s Stolen Death Star Plans. It\u2019s the entire Beatles album as accurately as we could record it, only now it tells the story of Star Wars: A New Hope \u2014 in order. We sweat the details on both sides in an effort to do both cultural milestones justice. Writing hyper-specific lyrics that match the original songs\u2019 cadences; reverse-engineering everything the Beatles recorded, from distorted saxophone riffs to Indian tabla rhythms; recording everything from scratch and learning as we went \u2014 well, that\u2019s what takes five years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cW0fYVRZQKeI4hZg3KSn4VWZ0hw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
