The opera follows events at the home of the wealthiest man in Vienna, who has booked both a comedy burlesque act and a serious opera group for entertainment. When the dinner runs long he declares that both forms of entertainment must take place at the same time - much to the chagrin of the opera's proud young composer. Filmed live in Baden-Baden on Feb. 25 by the veteran director Brian Large, Ren\u00e9e Fleming makes her debut in the role of Ariadne together with fellow key Strauss interpreters Sophie Koch and Christian Thielemann, following on from their Rosenkavalier triumph.  Thielemann conducts the Staatskapelle Dresden, the orchestra to whom Strauss dedicated his Alpine Symphony and which premiered Feuersnot, Salome, Elektra, Der Rosenkavalier and Daphne.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oM3OJyuC0ZagAgifT0WBflVkhy1.jpg", "actors": ["Christian Thielemann (Conductor)", "Ren\u00e9e Fleming ()", "Eike Wilm Schulte ()", "Sophie Koch ()", "Robert Dean Smith ()", "Jane Archibald ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
