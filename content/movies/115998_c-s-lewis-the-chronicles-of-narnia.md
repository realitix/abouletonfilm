Lewis is a literary legend. But the story of how this one-time atheist became an influential voice in modern Christianity is as fascinating as his fantasy world of lions, witches and wardrobes. Initially seen as a failure by friend J.R.R. Tolkien, Lewis's Narnia novels went on to sell millions of copies. This documentary traces the author's spiritual journey and the literary legacy he left behind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7E18WoDfrgxBuzsHs1kMOkzqgmC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
