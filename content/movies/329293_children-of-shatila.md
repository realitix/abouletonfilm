Located in Beirut's \"belt of misery,\" the camp is home to 15,000 Palestinians and Lebanese who share a common experience of displacement, unemployment and poverty.  Fifty years after the exile of their grandparents from Palestine, the children of Shatila attempt to come to terms with the reality of being refugees in a camp that has survived massacre, siege and starvation.  Director Mai Masri focuses on two Palestinian children in the camp: Farah, age 11 and Issa, age 12. When these children are given video cameras, the story of the camp evolves from their personal narratives as they articulate the feelings and hopes of their generation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ltFuaCc0hXBNyR2Z3YwFdDF2ucX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
