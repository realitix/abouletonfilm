Little do they realize that their plucky patriarch has laid some elaborate traps for them, employing his collection of life-size automatons. The cast wanders about through dimly-lit sets for what seems like an eternity before being slain by the wind-up robots in a variety of gory ways, but the violent, bloody climax comes far too late to rescue viewers from the endless drudgery.  Never released theatrically in the USA.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3GRRKvSmeO3bBXMYp8vGoC12h6r.jpg", "actors": ["Boris Karloff (Matthias Morteval)", "Julissa (Lucy Durant)", "Andr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda (Charles Beasley)", "Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Espinosa 'Ferrusquilla' (Dr. Emery Horvath (as \u00c1ngel Espinoza))", "Beatriz Baz (Cordelia Rash)", "Quint\u00edn Bulnes (Ivar Morteval)", "Manuel Alvarado (Morgenstern Morteval)", "Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez (Fodor)", "Carmen Velez ()", "Felipe de Flores ()", "Fernando Saucedo ()", "Estuardo Mora ()", "Jos\u00e9 Luis G. de Le\u00f3n ()", "Victor Jordan ()", "Jos\u00e9 Antonio Garcia ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [27800], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
