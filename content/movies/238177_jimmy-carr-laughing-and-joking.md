Touring to over 1.5 million people and hosting hit shows 8 Out of 10 Cats, 10 O'Clock Live and The Big Fat Quiz of the Year means that Jimmy knows a thing or two about making people laugh. The show is packed with one-liners, stories &amp; jokes. Some clever, some rude and a few totally unacceptable.
