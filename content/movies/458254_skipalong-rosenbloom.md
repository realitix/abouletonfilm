As it turned out, TV was the appropriate medium for this heavy-handed satire of video westerns. Former boxing champ Maxie Rosenbloom plays a lampooned variation of Hopalong Cassidy, with all the standard western cliches in evidence. \"Skipalong\" Rosenbloom is depicted as the star of a heavily commercialized TV kiddie show, presided over by a smarmy announcer. The plot proper finds \"Skipalong\" at odds with western bad guy Butcher Baer, played by Rosenbloom's onetime ring opponent Max Baer. Others in the cast are Jackie Coogan, Fuzzy Knight and Hillary Brooke, who seem to be having fun with the dreadful material foisted upon them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eMA3s3sMwLK9VVnpUmMPKcOhwJt.jpg", "actors": ["Maxie Rosenbloom (Skipalong Rosenbloom (as Slapsie Maxie Rosenbloom))", "Max Baer (Butcher Baer)", "Jackie Coogan (Buck Lovelace)", "Fuzzy Knight (Sneaky Pete)", "Hillary Brooke (Square Deal Sal (as Hillary Brook))", "Jacqueline Fontaine (Caroline Witherspoon)", "Raymond Hatton (Granpappy Tex Rosenbloom)", "Ray Walker (TV Announcer)", "Al Shaw (Al (as Shaw and Lee))", "Sam Lee (Sam (as Shaw and Lee))", "Joseph J.
