The wafer-thin plotline concerns the misadventures of Texan Gerald Durham (Jerome Courtland), who arrives in the Big City to learn the ropes of the music business. Durham not only ends up with a recording contract, but also wins heroine Peggy Martin (Lola Albright) in the bargain. So much for the story. The principal selling card of When You're Smiling consists of the guest-star turns by Frankie Laine, Bob Crosby, The Modernaires, The Mills Brothers, Kay Starr and Billy Daniels.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lmYQ0cpX95OBkeXEvK8lt048HnH.jpg", "actors": ["Jerome Courtland (Gerald Durham)", "Frankie Laine (Frankie Laine)", "Lola Albright (Peggy Martin)", "Jerome Cowan (Herbert Reynolds)", "Margo Woode (Linda Reynolds)", "Collette Lyons (Nan Doran)", "Robert Shayne (Jack Lacey)", "Don Otis (Don Otis)", "Ray Teal (Steve)", "Jimmy Lloyd (Dave)", "Donna Hamilton (Margie)", "Edward Earle (Foster)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
