Recorded at his last ever tour.  Frankie Boyle has been pilloried, misrepresented and demonised. And for what? For Telling It Like It Is. Now he will attempt a final tour, to heal Britain's fools. To support its rioters. To offer the inchoate laughter of despair to a culture in freefall. These are The Last Days Of Sodom.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3W1YMIoEzeKJu4yxYhUK8rySqQV.jpg", "actors": ["Frankie Boyle (Frankie Boyle)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [50344], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
