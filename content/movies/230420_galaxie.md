H. Auden, Jasper Johns, Susan Sontag, Storm De Hirsch, Jonas Mekas, Allen Ginsberg, and George and Mike Kuchar, most observed in their homes or studios. Filmed in vibrant color, Galaxie pulses with life. It is a masterpiece of in-camera composition and editing, and stands as a vibrant response to Andy Warhol's contemporary Screen Tests.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sOqs1ytnNnXRxT9geQZBTHLkl1V.jpg", "actors": ["Parker Tyler (Himself)", "Storm De Hirsch (Herself)", "Amy Taubin (Herself)", "George Kuchar (Himself)", "Mike Kuchar (Himself)", "Charles Boultenhouse (Himself)", "Jonas Mekas (Himself)", "Jasper Johns (Himself)", "W.H.
