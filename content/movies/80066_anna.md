Anna refuses Yasha's offer of marriage and he therefore runs off to Siberia. After Pavel is hailed as a hero because he survives a fire accident in factory (which is in fact effect of his sabotage), Anna marries him. Pavel then becomes a reckless communist careerist, but only on surface. In fact, he is a traitor of the country and a spy, and gives Anna's party ID card to anti-communist movement. In spite of that, Anna is expelled from the communist party. Yasha returns from Siberia, only to find her love Anna desperate. They reveal the truth about Pavel (that he is a kulak who killed a kolchoz co-op leader), which means an end for Pavel.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6pLIJuihNrwF8ZPzjTBEq3VzNgA.jpg", "actors": ["Andrei Abrikosov (Pavel Kurganov)", "Anatoli Goryunov (Feodor)", "Igor Maleyev (Yasha)", "Ada Vojtsik (Anna)", "Inna Fyodorova (Tanya)", "Sergei Antimonov (Philip Maksimovich Kulikov)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
