The widow's broker has a wealthy friend, who becomes very interested in the girl, although he is twice her age. He proposes marriage, believing that he can win her love through kindness. The girl, for her mother' sake accepts and they are married. Despite his great love he is unable to overcome the great difference in their ages, so he buys the worthless oil stock so that she may be independent, and he then leaves her to go back to his oil fields.
