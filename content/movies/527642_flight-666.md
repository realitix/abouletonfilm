By going in I expected something very bad. But this movie turned out to be really enjoyable. All the actors are widely unknown but nobody felt terrible. Each one delivered what they should and on top the haunted girls looked pretty good. A little bit of CGI combined with mostly practical effects, a nice little story and a cast who obviously had fun doing this movie are the outcome. Kudos!"}], "recommandations_id": [455304, 500535, 37306, 533527], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
