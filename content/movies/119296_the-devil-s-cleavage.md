The intricate, overheated plot involves a nurse trapped in an unhappy marriage who escapes the big city in search of greener pastures in Blessed Prairie, Oklahoma. Swerving from earnest homage to dark satire, Kuchar simultaneously imitates and savages the legacy of Sirk, Preminger and Minnelli that inspired him, gleefully intertwining the suggestive and the scatological, while also pointing towards the later postmodern parodies of Cindy Sherman. The Devil\u2019s Cleavage is also a rich time capsule of 1970s San Francisco, replete with cameos from Curt McDowell and Art Spiegelman.\" \u2014hcl.harvard.edu", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xyl7FchlKTETELOOJmMKOHykYIv.jpg", "actors": ["Curt McDowell (Frank)", "Virginia Giritlian (Angie)", "Ainslie Pryor (Ginger)", "Kathleen Hohalek ()", "Michelle Gross ()", "Mark Ellinger ()", "Ilka Normile ()", "Ann Knutson ()", "Janey Sneed ()", "Al Wong ()", "Charley Thomas ()", "Barbara Linkevitch ()", "Donna Kerness ()", "Laurie Hendricks ()", "Bocko (Bonzo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "LMBuzvkl82I"}
