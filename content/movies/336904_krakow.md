Streetcars share tree-lined streets with horse-drawn carriages; people conduct business under umbrella-covered markets and arcaded market halls; parks and schoolyards host sports, games and animated discussions. Scenes of the famous Remu Synagogue and the Alte Shul, an orphanage, a hospital, the Jewish Community Council, and several schools convey the vitality of this age-old Jewish community.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Asher Lerner (Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
