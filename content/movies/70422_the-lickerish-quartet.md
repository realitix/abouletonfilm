The son is testy, so they go into town and watch a circus-like thrill ride. The daredevil woman in the show looks exactly like one of the women in the movie, so the man invites her to join them for a nightcap. Tensions among the family seem to rise. She stays overnight, and during her 24 hours in the castle, each of its three residents involves her in a fantasy. She, in turn, keeps asking, \"Who has the gun?\" Will there be violence before it's over?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/amp1u9muF4FwssQeVzwMTkX3Caq.jpg", "actors": ["Silvana Venturelli (The visitor)", "Frank Wolff (Castle owner)", "Erika Remberg (His wife)", "Paolo Turco (Her son)", "Karl-Otto Alberty (Bit Part (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [76321, 90949, 82203, 45817], "youtube_key": "PZkFmB__zQg"}
