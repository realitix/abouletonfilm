Trans woman Huang Yi braves coming out to her patronizing male roommate and her devoutly Catholic father, whose signature she needs for male-to-female surgery. Meanwhile, Huang\u2019s defiantly proud post-op friend, Liu Mann, reminds us all that the greatest challenges are of the heart, not the body. A director of passionate, socially topical films including \u201eFactory Boss\u201d (2014), Zhang Wei has created a queer-positive film that details patriarchy, heterosexism, and transphobia while following a father\u2019s gradual recognition of his daughter\u2019s struggle and his embrace of a new meaning for family.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6KJxttM1HAVpxUXiQR9jyXGTknZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
