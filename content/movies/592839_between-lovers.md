She runs off to another city, goes to the nearest bar and meets a struggling young artist, and the two strike up a romantic affair. Meanwhile the husband catches onto his wife's two-timing, checks up on her and winds up in the bar where he meets the struggling young artist, and the two of them pick up a couple of women and lay them. Complicating things even more, the wife carries on her affair while not really sure as to whether or not she should break up with her hus-band, but as in most fairy-tale romances, all ends well.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1nWeQQ7UgzEZ2ursdTMYPvpNMJM.jpg", "actors": ["Jesie St. James ()", "John Leslie ()", "Joey Silvera ()", "Georgina Spelvin ()", "Mai Lin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
