Albom makes a visit to his former home town in New Jersey, where Rabbi Lewis has served a congregation for about 50 years. Albom doesn't feel worthy, especially since he is no longer a practicing Jew and, in fact, he has married a Christian (who apparently isn't active either). Nevertheless, Rabbi Lewis says he is the one to do the job, and over the next eight years, Albom makes several visits back home and even attends some Sabbath services, where the good rabbi is determined to continue working and inspiring his flock even as his health declines.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hO6Po8laOHB19qtnPsz9BaMBFp8.jpg", "actors": ["Laurence Fishburne (Henry Covington)", "Mykelti Williamson (Donnie)", "Bradley Whitford (Mitch)", "Martin Landau (Rabbi Albert Lewis)", "Anika Noni Rose (Annette)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
