Extralarge and Dumas are appointed by the police to investigate despite the fact they have another case to solve: the protection of an important politician who has received death threats. Extralarge discovers that all the Ninja's victims were part of a team of sappers in Vietnam responsible for the destruction of a small village, Nang Ky. The death squad was headed up in fact by the politician who the detective is protecting. Extralarge also finds out that Nang Ky was the most isolated outpost in Vietnam and had become a paradise for perdition and vice run by a number of American officers who, towards the end of the war, arranged for it to be destroyed by napalm so as to cancel any trace of their abuse.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/IWCwwiMI9hq8vAz2upew4fyHjS.jpg", "actors": ["Bud Spencer (Jack 'Extralarge' Costello)", "Michael Winslow ()", "Lou Bedford ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "1sxtMExDIVQ"}
