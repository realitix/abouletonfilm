This is not one of those times... Gram Parsons was one of the most influential musicians of his time; a bitter, brilliant, genius who knew Elvis, tripped with the Stones and fatally overdosed on morphine and tequila in 1973. And from his dying came a story. A story from deep within folklore; a story of friendship, honour and adventure; a story so extraordinary that if it didn't really happen, no one would believe it. Two men, a hearse, a dead rock star, five gallons of petrol, and a promise. And the most extraordinary chase of modern times.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j0zjTSBgE7XDwNpjgEFHTckDEV3.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Knoxville (Phil Kaufman)", "Christina Applegate (Barbara)", "Gabriel Macht (Gram Parsons)", "Marley Shelton (Susie)", "Robert Forster (Stanley Parsons)", "Michael Shannon (Larry Oster-Berg)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [74395, 19033, 39497, 44015], "youtube_key": "tDx_x5X6nnA"}
