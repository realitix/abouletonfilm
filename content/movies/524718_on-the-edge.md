The young Liya is standing on the edge of the roof, ready to commit suicide. At the last minute she is pushed away from edge by a neighbour, Sergei, who for some inexplicable reason appears on the roof at exactly the same time. During the verbal sparring that ensures it becomes clear that Liya planned the jump long ago and is determined to finish what she has begun. Sergei, it turns out, is on the roof with exactly the same intentions as Liya, but is not so sure that this is the right way forward, but then he does not see any other options to resolve his problem.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Evgeny Antropov ()", "Yuliya Sorokina ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
