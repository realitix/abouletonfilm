But upon completion of the picture, the men of the guild feel duped, because they don't consider themselves flatteringly depicted in the painting.  They therefore decline to pay for the work.  During this dispute, the painter finds out his wife is close to death.  He finds himself terribly lonely after her passing and suffers from depression until he decides once more to marry.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yr8S5O9kUH6CMmJZRPsFVsQubSb.jpg", "actors": ["Ewald Balser (Rembrandt van Rijn)", "Hertha Feiler (Saskia van Rijn)", "Gisela Uhlen (Hendrickje Stoffels)", "Elisabeth Flickenschildt (Geertje Dierks)", "Theodor Loos (Jan Six)", "Aribert W\u00e4scher (Saskias Vetter Ujlenburgh)", "Paul Henckels (Radierer Seeghers)", "Heinrich Schroth (Doktor Nicolaes Tulp)", "Erika von Thellmann (Jansje Ruytenburgh)", "Eduard von Winterstein (Ratsherr van Straaten)", "Heinrich Marlow (Vorsitzender des Konsistoriums)", "Jack Trevor ()", "O.E.
