{"tmdb_id": 594304, "title": "Cuck", "original_title": "Cuck", "slug_title": "cuck", "date": "", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "Ronnie is a young white male, struggling with the pressures of life. He\u2019s unemployed, rejected from the military for being mentally unstable, and lives at home with his ailing and nagging mother. Ronnie finds an outlet for his frustration online. The alt-right community gives him a place to belong and absolves his personal responsibility. Instead, the blame belongs with weak progressives who are trying to emasculate men and impose their multicultural, feminist agenda. Ronnie becomes obsessed with this conspiratorial rhetoric, clinging to values about defending America from immigrants (literally, with guns) and preserving the dominance of the white race. He idolizes the social media stars of the \u201crevolution\u201d and soon becomes one himself, with his popular, hate-fueled video rants. With the fictional but topical CUCK, director Rob Lambert masterfully weaves the real-life climate of American politics into his raw examination of the dangers of misplaced hate.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Zachary Ray Sherman (Ronnie)", "Sally Kirkland (Mother)", "Timothy V.
