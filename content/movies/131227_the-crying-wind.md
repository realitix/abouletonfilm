He and his 12-year-old grandson Akira live in a small, tree-lined village in the northern part of the island which is surrounded by a white-sand beach and plots of pine and flowering bushes. On the cliff that skirts the shore sits an open-air burial ground containing the skull of a kamikaze pilot who was shot down during the last days of World War II. When the wind blows through the bullet hole in the skull, it produces a whistling sound. The locals call it the \"Crying Head.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lVxlIXWLzodT5JEzumjFT2rMxAs.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
