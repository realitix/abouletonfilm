Later that same evening, he comes across a bar hostess who looks identical to the woman that he has just murdered. He eventually talks her into showing up for work in Veronica's place on the very next day, and handing in her resignation. Unfortunately for him, she is persuaded to stay, and decides to continue impersonating the deceased secretary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iXb4BXlRbgw4TU5ONBJyLROESrX.jpg", "actors": ["Veronica Yip (Lo Yin Hsin / Mimin)", "Alex Fong Chung-Sun (Lin Cha-Sin)", "Kent Tong (George)", "Charlie Cho (Charlie Chau)", "Mondi Yau Yuet-Ching (Miss Ode)", "Lee Yuet-Sin (May)", "Suen Kwok-Ming (Chiu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
