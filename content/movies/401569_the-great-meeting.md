Eager to spark interest in his boss\u2019s newspaper, he published news of a colourful bird, more like a parrot than a chicken, less like an ostrich than a swan. No one could work out the origin of this strange bird and a web of sensational stories soon spun, but it burst the moment it came out that the witty journalist repainted an ordinary duck. From that moment on every lie journalists tell is called a \u2018canard\u2019. Our film leads directly to the nest of one such duck, in Bucharest, where the inform-propaganda spin doctor Pavel Judin, instructed by wise managerial orders and Moscow, overblows this featherless bird to the pleasure of ones and the derision of others.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k2uuxTXQgXXU3FIL98AbJS4jGcW.jpg", "actors": ["Dragoje \u010covi\u0107 ((voice))", "Ivan Lali\u0107 ((voice))", "Josip Sudar ((voice))", "Stevo Vujatovi\u0107 ((voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
