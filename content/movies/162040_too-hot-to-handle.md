He's tough to intimidate. So when he starts getting threats and demands for protection, he fights back. Behind the takeover plot is a competitor, Diamonds Dielli. Midnight Franklin, who's Johnny's girlfriend and one of the club's headliners, wants to get Johnny out of the business. In the background are a sadistic client, an underage chorus girl, a wisecracking siren who's not averse to rough trade, a visiting journalist, and a dancer who guards her past. Can Johnny win the struggle with Diamonds, and can Midnight get him out of harm's way?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yOielL8wSOgGqedtCx7lCcDqasS.jpg", "actors": ["Jayne Mansfield (Midnight Franklin)", "Leo Genn (Johnny Solo)", "Karlheinz B\u00f6hm (Robert Jouvel)", "Danik Patisson (Lilliane Decker)", "Christopher Lee (Novak)", "Kai Fischer (Cynthia)", "Patrick Holt (Inspector West)", "Martin Boddey (Mr. Arpels)", "Sheldon Lawrence (Diamonds Dielli)", "Barbara Windsor (Ponytail)", "John Salew (Moeller)", "Tom Bowman (Flash Gordon)", "Ian Fleming (Pawnbroker)", "Penny Morrell (Terry)", "Katherine Keeton (Melody)", "Susan Denny (Marjorie)", "Judith Bruce (Maureen (as Judy Bruce))", "Elizabeth Wilson (Jacki)", "Shari Kahn (Jungle)", "Bill McGuffie (Piano Player)", "Michael Balfour (Tourist Guide)", "Larry Taylor (Mouth)", "June Elvin (Hostess)", "Morton Lowry (Dinelli's Driver)", "Martin Sterndale (Editor)", "Harry Lane (Muscles)", "Robin Chapman (Priest)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [93754, 65002, 61298, 29121], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
