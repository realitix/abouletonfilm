Zone in Orlando, Florida. It was the third event under the Sacrifice chronology. Nine matches were featured on the event's card. On the morning before the airing of the event, the Vice President of the National Wrestling Alliance stripped Christian Cage of the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and Team 3D of the NWA World Tag Team Championships due to Cage's refusal to defend the World Title in various NWA Territories. The NWA severed all ties with TNA, although the affected champions still had physical possession of the belts. The affected champions defended their \"status\" as champions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9byhpxkRyWMOeTGcesPtNkslwTe.jpg", "actors": ["Traci Brooks (Ms. Brooks)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
