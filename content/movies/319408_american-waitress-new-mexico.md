Their views about the vocation range from realistic to romantic to existential, but the mystery of how these waitresses spend their time off -- motorcycling, welding, mountain climbing -- may be the greater revelation.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
