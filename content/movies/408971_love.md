Then, no longer in costume, he talks with the camerawoman who is filming him, he writes a date and an hour (May 1, 1985, 10 a.m.) on a blackboard and then bursts out in rage at the fact that his girlfriend, Hiromi, has been missing for three days. A few moments of their love story are retraced, before returning to the gloomy desperation of the young man, who walks into the darkness of a night illuminated by neon signs and goes into a long monologue of love, directed at the girl.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e4eaZTYw5uZeYQk8A4ejVkhkqdh.jpg", "actors": ["Sion Sono ()", "Hiromi Kawanishi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
