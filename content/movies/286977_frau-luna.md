But for the head of the city's vice police, who was invited to the dress rehearsal, the costumes for the ladies onstage are a bit too revealing. He demands the show be cancelled as offensive. The president of the Thusneldenbund has taken it upon himself to alert everyone about the growth of immorality in the capital. The theatre director Knopp has come up with an idea to convince these \"fine\" gentlemen to let the operetta go onstage again: He intends to win over the friendship of the moral police and then nothing will stand in the way of \"Frau Luna\" once more being performed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lK2znZ1DmMVdirpif09KAL3UwKE.jpg", "actors": ["Lizzi Waldm\u00fcller (Operettens\u00e4ngerin Vera Waldner)", "Fita Benkhoff (Frau Elisabeth Gerlack)", "Irene von Meyendorff (Gerda)", "Theo Lingen (Lepke)", "Paul Kemp (Max)", "Georg Alexander (Pr\u00e4sident Felix L\u00fcdecke)", "Paul Henckels (Geheimrat Schmidt)", "Will Dohm (Direktor Knoppe)", "Karl Sch\u00f6nb\u00f6ck (Paul R\u00fcdinger)", "Hubert von Meyerinck (Rat Haschke)", "Paul Westermeier (Mechaniker Scholte)", "Ursula Herking (C\u00e4cilie)", "G\u00fcnther L\u00fcders (Friese)", "Hanne Hiob (M\u00e4dchen)", "Else von M\u00f6llendorff (Traute)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
