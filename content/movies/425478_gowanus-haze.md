The footage captures a landscape known as The Gowanus Canal, an area of Brooklyn, which was once inhabited by a productive port and industrial compound. The area is now overly polluted and is officially registered as a superfund site by the US environmental protection agency. Using the Gowanus Canal and surrounding landscape as a moment for reflection on the past, this film addresses the role of landscape and how it can work to incite memory and exercise reflection.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uIjpLTwBhVDrWaJCUw04TlMC1hW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
