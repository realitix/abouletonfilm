This film goes back to its beginning and those who felt called to plant an oasis of Christianity in the North American wilderness. In an imaginative, at times almost surrealistic, way the film recalls the highborn company from France, and shows what survives of Ville-Marie in the Montreal of today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/usReUFd4u9LYd10nAjy4wJ05iCv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
