The film further  strengthens the reputation of veteran documentarian Schreiner, who's quietly and steadily established himself among Europe's most respected practitioners  of non-fiction cinema. But the film is by no means an example of an \u2018auteur\u2019  imposing his individual vision upon the world. Instead it's a remarkable example of intense collaboration between artist and subject, one so close  that such traditional distinctions and labels seem inappropriate.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
