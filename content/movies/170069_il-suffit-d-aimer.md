Daniele Ajort plays the simple 19th-century French peasant girl who insists that she has experienced a vision of the Virgin Mary. Once this sighting becomes common knowledge, Bernadette's very existence becomes a religious and political hot potato. Thousands of people flock to the grotto at Lourdes where Bernadette claims she has seen the Holy Mother, believing that the waters therein contain recuperative powers. Bernadette dies under a cloud of controversy, but is ultimately elevated to sainthood by the Vatican.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Aq0nyIyBoZ1UdJtCqpHRNmHN1s6.jpg", "actors": ["Dani\u00e8le Ajoret (Bernadette Soubirous)", "Bernard La Jarrige (Fran\u00e7ois Soubirous)", "Madeleine Sologne (Madame Soubirous)", "Henri Nassiet (Le cur\u00e9 Peyramale)", "Jean-Jacques Delbo (Le commissaire Jacomet)", "Renaud Mary (Monseigneur Forcade)", "Nadine Alari (M\u00e8re Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
