On May 26, 2009, with Canadian allies, gay American families rally at a Vancouver demonstration to protest these amendments that persecute the LGBTQ community. Demonstration organizer Roger Chin relays the California Supreme Court's infamous decision on Prop 8. Subsequent speakers talk about couples living in exile. Weaving elements of public protest and intimate interviews, four families share their stories of how they met, their decision to escape to freedom in Canada, their Canadian experience and their dreams of returning to their home country, family and friends. In the end, the organizer celebrates the freedoms to marry that exists in Canada.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zW9UoCrQ5ftDG1w48AVs0zD3bLX.jpg", "actors": ["Roger Chin (himself - protest organizer)", "Carl Meadows (himself - protest speaker)", "Donald Lim (himself - love exile)", "Steven Rowe (himself - love exile)", "Michael Smith (himself - love exile)", "Paul Holzapfel (himself - love exile)", "Terry Frost (herself - love exile)", "Kenzie Frost (herself - love exile)", "Catherine Frost (herself - love exile)", "Richard Dalton (himself - love exile)", "Luis Grisales (himself - love exile)", "Jim VanDeventer (himself - filmmaker)", "Meg Andronowska (herself - protest organizer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "dvYqpyM4-Ew"}
