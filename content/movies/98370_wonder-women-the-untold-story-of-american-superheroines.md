Heroic role models are important in childhood development, yet there are a dearth of these for girls. Wonder Woman provides a rare example of a female heroine who doesn't require rescue, determines her own missions, and possesses uniquely feminine values. Featuring Gloria Steinem, actors Lynda Carter and Lindsey Wagner, and a colorful cast of scholars, writers, and fans, the film challenges pop culture's gender biases by looking at how Wonder Woman's storyline changed over time while considering how women are rarely depicted as heroic, powerful, or world-changing", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ojB37sQIRjxj3wx2IeMAd4BYJCt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "bwuGGoNRtgE"}
