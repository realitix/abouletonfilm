One of them writes a novel while the others try to become a gang and prepare a robbery; some fall in love, or seem to be, or believe (or say) they are in love. But these two, three, ten plot lines unfold from what the characters hide or just don\u2019t know, connecting the writing of the novel and the forming of the gang, and the past of two of the characters with that of the house, and of those who perhaps were the two most bitter enemies of nineteenth century Argentine history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AfrN35qyVkEErcbJe0V48riSHJ9.jpg", "actors": ["Romina Paula (Helena)", "Mar\u00eda Villar (M\u00f3nica)", "Julia Mart\u00ednez Rubio (Isabel)", "Pilar Gamboa (Emilia)", "Juli\u00e1n Tello (Camilo)", "Juli\u00e1n Larquier Tellarini (Chas)", "Esteban Bigliardi (Iv\u00e1n)", "Esteban Lamothe (J.M.R.)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
