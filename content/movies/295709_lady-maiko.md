Eager to start her career, she approaches a teahouse in one of Kyoto\u2019s famous geisha districts to become an apprentice geisha, or maiko\u2014only to be rejected due to her lack of references, country bumpkin dialect and uncultivated demeanor. By chance, her accent catches the interest of Professor Kyono, a linguistics specialist and regular patron at the teahouse. He strikes a deal with the teahouse proprietor, promising to transform Haruko\u2019s strong dialect into ladylike speech within 6 months. But becoming a maiko is no easy feat: have the professor and Haruko underestimated the task ahead?  Based loosely on the Audrey Hepburn classic My Fair Lady, Lady Maiko is a musical comedy that provides a window into the world of geisha and the dedication it takes to achieve your dreams.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/18ScZ83SHsJK0EJNp2sSilbFK11.jpg", "actors": ["Mone Kamishiraishi (Haruko Saigo)", "Hiroki Hasegawa (Hoshi Kyono)", "Sumiko Fuji (Chiharu Kojima)", "Tamiyo Kusakari (Rishun)", "Eri Watanabe (Mameharu)", "Masahiro Takashima (Yoshio Takai)", "Fumiyo Kohinata (Kanpachiro Ichikawa)", "Gaku Hamada (Akihira Nishino)", "Satoshi Tsumabuki (Yuichiro Akaki)", "Naoto Takenaka (Tomi-san)", "Tomoko Tabata (Momoharu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "PiKdorsIfg8"}
