Proud of his work, the boy wants to impress his grandfather and journeys through the woods to find him. Along the path Maq meets a curious traveller named Mi\u2019gmwesu. Together they share stories, medicine, laughter and song. Maq begins to care less about making a good impression and more about sharing the knowledge and spirit he's found through his creation. It is only when Maq joins his grandfather that he understands who Mi\u2019gmwesu really is.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vVDjtjGpUnprq14TyppTNHm7T9S.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
