Silvestre Pantale\u00f3n follows the protagonist as he struggles to pay for a curing ceremony and provide for his family. He dedicates himself to the only remunerative activities he knows: handcrafting rope for religious ceremonies and building seldom used household objects that he alone still has the skills to produce. Silvestre Pantale\u00f3n is a simple though universal tale of aging, told with a lyrical combination of lingering imagery and quotidian\u00b4s life detail.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wiIruAXuzEoSsfhOnFFW5HwW2C0.jpg", "actors": ["Silvestre Pantale\u00f3n ()", "Alejandro Cenario ()", "Jerem\u00edas Cabrera ()", "Ezequiel Herrera ()", "Paula Pantale\u00f3n ()", "Rutilia Barrera ()", "Eugenio Santos ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
