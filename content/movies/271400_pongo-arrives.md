We see reaction shots from members of the public who look up into the sky. A man who is filming a young boy looks up at the skywriting through a telescope at the same time. The aeroplane drops a large box from the sky. It crashes on the ground and Pongo jumps out bowing, pirouetting and looking very pleased with himself. A policeman comes along and says \"Where's your Collar?\"", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
