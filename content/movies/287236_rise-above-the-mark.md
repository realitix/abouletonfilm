Legislators are calling the shots and putting public schools in an ever-shrinking box. WLCSC Board of School Trustees and Superintendent of Schools, Rocky Killion, want to secure resources and legislative relief necessary to achieve the school district\u2019s mission of creating a world-class educational system for all children. The school district\u2019s strategic plan will introduce a model of education that puts decision making back into the hands of local communities and public school teachers, rather than leaving it in the hands of legislators and ultimately lining the pockets of corporations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aTTTkIXjK6Ud4wITZSmV1xdnksn.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Coyote (Narrator)", "Dr. Diane Ravitch (former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Education and Education Historian)", "Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond (Charles Ducommun Professor of Education, Stanford University)", "Dr. Marc Tucker (President and CEO of the National Center on Education and the Economy)", "Dr. Pasi Sahlberg (Director General of National Centre for International Mobility and Cooperation in the Ministry of Education in Helsinki, Finland)", "Jamie Vollmer (Author, speaker and supporter of public schools)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "RD3wFLmmz6k"}
