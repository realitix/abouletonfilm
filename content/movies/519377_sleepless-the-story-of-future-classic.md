It quickly became an incubator of local talent and launched the careers of genre-bending artists like Nick Murphy (formerly known as Chet Faker), Flight Facilities and Flume. This documentary traces the label's growth from a small DIY collective to an unstoppable force in contemporary music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ocbXwk4KURyHvBrw2eR9CgUDliF.jpg", "actors": ["Regan Mathews (Ta-ku/Himself)", "Alex Cameron (Member of 'Seekae'/Himself)", "John Hassel (Member of 'Seekae'/Himself)", "George Nicholas (Member of 'Seekae'/Himself)", "Thomas Lefran\u00e7ois (Himself)", "Daniel Askill (Himself)", "Nathan McLay (Himself)", "Chad Gillard (Himself)", "Jay Ryves (Himself)", "Michael Di Francesco (Touch Sensitive/Himself)", "Touch Sensitive (Himself)", "James McInnes (Himself)", "Ben Marshall (Himself)", "Hugo Gruzman (Member of 'Flight Facilities'/Himself)", "James Lyell (Member of 'Flight Facilities'/Himself)", "Hayden Luby (Himself)", "Hayden James (Himself)", "Harley Streten (Flume/Himself)", "Toby L (Himself)", "Claire Collins (Herself)", "Thaddeus Rudd (Himself)", "Steve Goodgold (Himself)", "Nick Murphy (Chet Faker/Himself)", "Julian Hewitt (Himself)", "Jono Ma (Himself)", "Jagwar Ma (Himself)", "Chris Tabron (Himself)", "Wafia Al-Rikabi (Himself)", "Jonas Kenton (Member of 'Kenton Slash Demon'/Himself)", "Silas Moldenhawer (Member of 'Kenton Slash Demon'/Himself)", "Charles Murdoch (Himself)", "Ayo Olatunji (Himself)", "Latane Hughes (Himself)", "Ed Sholl (Himself)", "Harry White (Himself)", "Theo Bark (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "qkIFO5oca8s"}
