Using his body and his own life, he created the Tougen Flute and sealed Higari shortly after his death. However, through a special ritual, those who seek Higari's power can resurrect her by replaying eight notes on the Tougen Flute to undo Sougen's seal. In the present, while Kouga Saezima has travelled to the promised land (Garo: Soukoku no Maryu), two fallen priests,Jabi and Rekka, will attempt to return Higari.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nfoJZTiSknOI5WWd4XiFQy0p8CC.jpg", "actors": ["Yasue Sato (Jabi)", "Mary Matsuyama (Rekka)", "Kanji Tsuda (Kengi)", "Kumi Takiuchi (Agi)", "Miku \u014cno (Magi)", "Yuzumi Shibamoto (Rin Yamagatana)", "Masahiro Kuranuki (Shiguto)", "Hitomi Takahashi (Higari)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [257171, 227366], "youtube_key": "FpxsH6CI-oc"}
