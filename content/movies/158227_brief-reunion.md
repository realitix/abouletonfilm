Aaron Clark has it all: financial security, a beautiful wife, and a close-knit circle of old friends. But this cozy life is shattered by the arrival of Teddy, former classmate and proverbial snake.  Teddy worms his way back into their lives, \u2018befriends\u2019 Aaron\u2019s wife and hijacks Aaron\u2019s 40th birthday surprise. He systematically stalks them \u2014 at home, at work, and in cyberspace. Bitter over Aaron\u2019s success, Teddy pries into his business affairs and hints at improprieties, threatening extortion and revenge.  He relentlessly pushes, until Aaron snaps. And suddenly the question on everyone\u2019s mind: Is Aaron really the man he appears to be? Or is it true that \u201cNobody really knows anybody, least of all themselves?\u201d This deep, dark question goes at the heart of human nature, and in Brief Reunion, finds some disturbing and even fatal answers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9jvMlwA0xHBfx09ANJ0rEYjpJ3e.jpg", "actors": ["Joel de la Fuente (Aaron)", "Alexie Gilmore (Lea)", "Scott Shepherd (Teddy)", "Francie Swift (Gitta)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
