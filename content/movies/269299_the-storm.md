One of the best of these was Arashi, directed by Hiroshi Inagaki of Rickshaw Man fame. Anticipating Hollywood's Table for Five by nearly a quarter of a century, the film concerns the efforts by a recently widowed high-school teacher to raise his four children alone. Chihu Ryu is terrific as the central character, while Izumi Yukimura is even better as Ryu's eldest daughter. For reasons unknown, Arashi is often omitted from \"official\" lists of Inagaki's films.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zhsh7qibOGYSGIYrNmR1hRo3tpW.jpg", "actors": ["Chish\u016b Ry\u016b ()", "Kinuyo Tanaka ()", "Daisuke Kat\u00f4 ()", "Akira Kubo ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
