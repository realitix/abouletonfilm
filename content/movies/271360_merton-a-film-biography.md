For nearly 27 years he was a monk of the austere Trappist order, where he became an eloquent spiritual writer and mystic as well as an anti-war advocate and witness to peace.  Merton: A Film Biography provides the first comprehensive look at this remarkable 20th century religious philosopher who wrote, in addition to his immensely popular autobiography The Seven Storey Mountain, over 60 books on some of the most pressing social issues of our time, some of which are excerpted here.  Merton offers an engaging profile of a man whose presence in the world touched millions of people and whose words and thoughts continue to have a profound impact and relevance today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jcfT6rOmGqprJBSLSUROW6Pgp9d.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
