However, her husband Cheung Ching is impotent, yet clever enough in developing a drug that can heal his shortcoming;  \"Prodigal\": Yin Ching is a martial arts master who knows how to achieve victory with each part of his body, except for his most private part, until a prostitute teaches him a most important good lesson;  \"Black Whirlwind\": Li Kwai is thwarted by his own fame. Faked whirlwinds are everywhere looking to take advantage. A lustful girl is wise and fortunate enough to play dirty, with both impostors, as well as our genuine hero.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bydDuwsVgXiAQYtUU0XPZwu3vVZ.jpg", "actors": ["Elvis Tsui ()", "Teresa Mak ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
