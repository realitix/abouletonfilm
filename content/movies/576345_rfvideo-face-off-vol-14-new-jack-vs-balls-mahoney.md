Every once in a while you have two very strong personalities that just don\u2019t like each other. Someone might start something and usually it ends up in a fist fight inside the locker room which is the case we have had here between New Jack and Balls Mahoney in Philly at the ECW reunion show in June of 2012.The only thing about this feud is it never ended the night they fought. It was left unfinished, until the night RF VIDEO brought them together for one of the most unforgettable DVDs of all time and you can watch it unfold like never before.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jerome Young (Himself)", "Jonathan Rechner (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
