Farmers are having to kill calves which it is uneconomical to keep, paying token amounts to the local fox-hunt as unofficial knackers to dispose of the carcases for feeding to the fox-hounds. Why should society seem to care so much about the fate of hunted foxes and yet apparently so little about what happens to unwanted cattle which are cross-breed or the wrong sex? There is great resentment (as typified by the Countryside Alliance marches in London) to changes that are being imposed by a government that people in the country feel is neglecting their wishes in preference to those of the city-dwellers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q0jriU4f3gSDYoztReATDLJbP4o.jpg", "actors": ["Molly Dineen (Herself/Interviewer/Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
