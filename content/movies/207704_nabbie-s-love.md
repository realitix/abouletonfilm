Especially it focusses on the story of a grandma named Nabbie, but although it's her story told in the film's centre there are some young people, the grand-daughter of Nabbie and a young Japanese who just came to visit the little island. As the film evolves with the more or less ordinary events of the little island's inhabitant's more or less ordinary life, the story behind Nabbie's life gets more and more obvious. It's a surprise to most everyone involved in one or the other way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oaCYQaVUxVjb4gW5HOb1qCOtuxQ.jpg", "actors": ["Naomi Nishida (Agarikinjo, Nanako)", "Jun Murakami (Fukunosuke)", "Tomi Taira ()", "Reiko Kaneshima ()", "Rinsh\u00f4 Kadekaru ()", "Misako \u00d4shiro ()", "Rinji Kadekaru ()", "Ashley MacIsaac ()", "Shinei Nakamine ()", "Seijin Noborikawa ()", "Masahiro Shimanuki ()", "Susumu Taira ()", "Shinichi Tsuba ()", "Satoe Uza ()", "Y\u00fbkichi Yamasato ()", "Taeko Yoshida ()", "Morikuni \u00d4ta ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
