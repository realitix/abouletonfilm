{"tmdb_id": 263884, "title": "Cast", "original_title": "Cast", "slug_title": "cast", "date": "2000-01-01", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "Cast creates a claustrophobic and haunting space where people and things invade worlds in which they do not normally belong. Lifeless dolls are heaped inside drawers, dolled-up life size figures lie motionless on a windy beach at the water\u2019s edge; a chair rocks in an empty room, a mirror reflects and observes, and a chest of drawers is caressed by the sea. The film has a dramatic sensibility that sets up a false promise of narrative. Its structure, instead, is akin to that of dreams where different scenic spaces collapse and the inanimate and animate interchange. Wide-angled perspectives, shifting points of view and juxtapositions of sound and silence force inner and outer realities to collide, creating an unsettling psychic world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fW52JKJBHu25gnokvdcnTt9yAwW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
