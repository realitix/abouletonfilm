Where the only rendezvous is a lurid one and the only thing cheaper than a trip around the world is the soul of the pretty young thing selling the ride. Enter Daisy (Mia Zottoli), a small-change stripper with dreams of an empire who will not stop until she holds the city in her silken fist. Assembling a crack team of next level super-hookers and moving their action out of the alley and onto the hill, Daisy's syndicate takes aim at the wealthy elite. But when the scandal heats up, Vice Detective Angie (Holly Sampson) hits the case hard while whetting her own appetites and ducking an Internal Affairs (CC Costigan) investigation into her partner's nasty habits, proving that no one is what they seem in Vice City, unless they seem real naughty.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1c7rlDojhnYQzPEzwZ7hmYt24yh.jpg", "actors": ["Holly Sampson ()", "C.C.
