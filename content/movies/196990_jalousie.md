For whatever reason, Camille (Lio), an artist in her own right, finds him entrancing and easily succumbs to his devious efforts to get her into bed. Soon she is trying to hold him to her with her oh-so submissive love, and he is playing some games with her head by pretending (usually) to have been playing around with others. Eventually, he encounters another woman who is not so sticky and tells her to buzz off. When they meet some time later, it becomes clear that the relationship meant different things to each of them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ifijZ7WrtWebmGlSiTbPqp6Nzhs.jpg", "actors": ["Lio (Camille)", "Christian Vadim (Pierre)", "Odette Laure (Gis\u00e8le)", "V\u00e9ronique Delbourg (Claire)", "Caroline Lecoyer (Sabine)", "Abel Jafri (Abel)", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Berthelot (Kevin)", "Sylvie Loeillet ()", "Sophie Dalezio (Marie-Paule)", "Yves Berger (Leporello)", "Gabriel Dussurget (Directeur du festival d'Aix)", "Fran\u00e7ois Gautier (Le Commenduer)", "Eric Martin-Bonnet (Voix de leporello et de commenduer (voice))", "Catherine Millot (Donna Anna (voice))", "Nicolas Rivenq (Don Juan (voice))", "Gilles Robert (Don Juan)", "Caroline Tarrit (Donna Anna)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
