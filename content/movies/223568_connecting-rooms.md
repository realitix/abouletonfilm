The screenplay is based on the play The Cellist by Marion Hart.  The plot explores the relationships shared by the residents of a seedy boarding house owned by dour Mrs. Brent. Among them are busker Wanda Fleming, who is flattered by the attention paid her by rebellious pop songwriter wannabe Mickey Hollister, and former schoolmaster James Wallraven, who has been accused of pedophilia and reduced to working as a janitor in an art gallery.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ir2k9rd9jMFkhpLrSUuZNAVKbt6.jpg", "actors": ["Bette Davis (Wanda Fleming)", "Michael Redgrave (James Wallraven)", "Alexis Kanner (Mickey Hollister)", "Kay Walsh (Mrs. Brent)", "Leo Genn (Dr. Norman)", "Olga Georges-Picot (Claudia)", "Richard Wyler (Dick Grayson)", "Mark Jones (Johnny)", "Gabrielle Drake (Jean)", "Brian Wilde (Ellerman)", "Tony Hughes (Lew)", "John Woodnutt (Doctor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
