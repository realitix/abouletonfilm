It could be called pre-programmed chaos or the beginning of a common vision. After nearly two years of work, the film is finished, pure soul has come out! Camera and direction show boulders in a unique style. The philsophy and climbing art of Bernd Zangerl set the crown on the film. The locations were Ticino, Magic Wood and the mountains of the Silvretta. Each area has its own character, its own style and ambience. 'Every centimeter has its meaning. As with Humbold's natural vision, thought and feeling merge, and here the symbiosis of man and rock, man's stone, humanized petrified. \"  The film shows Bernd Zangerl, Barbara Zangerl and Thomas \"Steini\" Steinbrugger during bouldering at Magic Wood, Silvretta and Ticino. The best and most beautiful first visits by Bernd Zangerl are documented as well as spectacular highballs and low water soloing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8KUZbcxszWWYFldTwEX3ArwQvCD.jpg", "actors": ["Bernd Zangerl (Bernd Zangerl)", "Barbara Zangerl ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "0zK3ySs2UVU"}
