The title character, played by Zidra Ritenbergs, is the restless wife of a provincial village fisherman. Unwilling to dedicate herself to her husband, Malwa seeks out love from every man she meets. This results in a romantic triangle that is at once disarmingly simplistic and intensely dramatic. Malwa was the final directorial effort of Vladimir Braun, who died in 1957. Star Zidra Ritenbergs won a \"Best Actress\" award at the Venice Film Festival; co-stars Pavel Usovicenko and Anatoll Ighnaliev also earned praise for their realistic performances.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eBGpRw8c8Te9hQibiTQqDkY407H.jpg", "actors": ["Dzidra Ritenberga (Malva)", "Anatoliy Ignatyev ()", "Arkadi Tolbuzin ()", "Arkadi Tolbuzin (Ignaty Fomich)", "Pavel Usovnichenko ()", "Gennadiy Yukhtin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
