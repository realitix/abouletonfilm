The gates of hell are opened to free the hungry ghosts who wander the world seeking food. During this month, Chinese pay tribute to their ancestors and offer food to the deceased to appease them and ward off bad luck.  In Hong Kong, besides staging ceremonies to honor the dead, many Taoist organizations also give away rice to the elderly and the poor. The rice distribution depicted in this film was one of the largest events, and attracted over eight thousand people.  The event was scheduled to last from nine in the morning to six in the evening. In order to ensure a place in the line, most of the participants arrived before dawn.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/25H4woJExnCzwtBxWklqSWV6tp2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
