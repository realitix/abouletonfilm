I have broken apart the story and set it as a mechanical game with a series of repetitions where CINDERELLA is projected back and forth like a ping-pong ball between the hearth and the castle. She never succeeds in satisfying the requirements of the \u2018Cinderella Game\u2019. The film was shot MOS, the dialogue is lip-synched, and along with the out-front score and effects track magnifies the film\u2019s sense of alienation.\u201d \u2014 E.B. 1984", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wduGzjNRroY5meZW6Y0PJY1MSht.jpg", "actors": ["Gigi Kalweit (Cinderella)", "Mike Kelley (Accordian Player)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
