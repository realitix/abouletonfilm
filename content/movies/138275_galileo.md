Stirring up controversy with his theory that the Earth is not the center of the Universe, Galileo is given a going-over by the Vatican legal system.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ihETdEROtB0bGkjrD3Ds2vsJBeg.jpg", "actors": ["Cyril Cusack (Galileo)", "Georgi Kaloyanchev (Giordano Bruno)", "Nikolay Doychev (Belarmin)", "Miroslav Mindov (Kardinal Bordzhiya)", "Georgi Cherkelov (Toskana's ambasador)", "Mikhail Mikhajlov (Sarpi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [156135], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
