In 1973 concerts, the band left the stage after Act Two and a filmed version of 'The Hare...' was shown.\r A spoken-word comedic interlude (narrated by Jeffrey Hammond with an exaggerated Lancashire accent) backed by instrumentation. Presented as an absurd fable, the interlude details (with much wordplay) the failure of a group of anthropomorphic animals to help a hare find his missing eyeglasses.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eTDRIEH5OUJYolrzYrssNqTaC1E.jpg", "actors": ["Ian Anderson ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
