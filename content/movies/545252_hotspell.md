Social interactions blend more smoothly than the clash of air masses which threaten to clobber a prairie town in a vortex of violence.  Flashbacks and flashpoints flare-up along with thunderheads that loom and boom with vibrations of doom, their every move charted with vivid vibrancy on videographic maps which detail developing devastation.  Desire and death are in the air along with some aromatic wisps of ethnic edibles, so be sure to sniff it all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fnC6TTWetGTl0CwIrwASJStsHH9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
