He has already hired Turkoman tribespeople for his film and selected his filming location. Meanwhile his wife, who is working on her Ph.D. dissertation about the Mongol invasion of Iran, attempts to dissuade him from accepting the assignment. One night, while working on his history of the cinema series, the director fantasizes a diagetic world that consists of clever juxtapositions of his different worlds: the history of cinema, the history of the mongol invasion, his own film idea and his imminent assignment to the desert.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9lIdLrQgoPMSbI19qFU4lBxegC5.jpg", "actors": ["Fahimeh Rastegar (Director's Wife)", "Parviz Kimiavi (Director)", "Aqa Seyyed ()", "Ali Mirza ()", "Edris Chamani ()", "Darvish Abbas ()", "Bahman Farmanara ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
