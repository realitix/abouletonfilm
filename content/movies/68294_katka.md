Following on from the European Film Academy Award winning RENE (2008), Trestikova brings us KATKA \u2013 14 years in the life of a drug addict. KATKA is an extraordinarily raw and uncensored character portrait of a troubled young woman living on the edge of human existence, desperately searching for love and salvation. Will she find it in the rehab? Will she find it in the arms of the man she loves? Or in the first cry of her long-desired baby? Tagging along with her through the back streets and squalors of Prague, Trestikova gets deep under the skin of a person most of us would cross the road to avoid, and shows us Katka\u2019s profoundly human face. You might be angry with Katka, or your heart may go out to her. One thing is certain \u2013 you will never forget her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pzerZZab0idqiPeaMyELS9bemwK.jpg", "actors": ["Kate\u0159ina Brad\u00e1\u010dov\u00e1 (Kate\u0159ina Brad\u00e1\u010dov\u00e1)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
