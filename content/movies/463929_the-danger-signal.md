Instead, he convinces her to hand over her new baby to his care so that the child will be brought up with \"everything money can buy.\" Unbeknownst to the grandfather, we learn that there are twin sons and our heroine keeps one baby to raise herself. The narrative jumps ahead to the boy's twenty-first birthday and we see what's become of them. Not surprisingly, the wealthy son has grown up spoiled and greedy while the poor one works hard and loves his mother.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jane Novak (Mary Browning)", "Dorothy Revier (Laura Whitman)", "Robert Edeson (Cyrus Browning)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
