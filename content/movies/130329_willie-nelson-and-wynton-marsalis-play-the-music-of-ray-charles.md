Rose Hall on February 10, 2009.  Once in a while the stars align and something magical happens...as on the night Jazz at Lincoln Center presented a salute to the late, great bluesman, Ray Charles. Two musical iconoclasts, Willie Nelson and Wynton Marsalis, along with the stunning songstress Norah Jones, collectively brought their unique musical perspective to the legendary artist s hits such as Hallelujah I Love Her So, Hit the Road Jack, and Unchain My Heart. The evening s musicians are supported by insightful and vibrant performances from saxaphonist Walter Blanding, pianist Dan Nimmer, bassist Carlos Henriquez, drummer Ali Jackson, and harmonica great Mickey Raphael.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oWdyMwJhYfOjH2HUEBuBWOteKDi.jpg", "actors": ["Willie Nelson (Himself - Vocals and Acoustic Guitar)", "Wynton Marsalis (Himself - Trumpet and Vocals)", "Norah Jones (Herself - Vocals)", "Mickey Raphael (Himself - Harmonica)", "Dan Nimmer (Himself - Piano)", "Carlos Enriquez (Himself - Bass)", "Ali Jackson (Himself - Percussion)", "Walter Blanding (Himself - Tenor Saxophone)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "MCj96k1A95g"}
