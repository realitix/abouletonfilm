Xapiri is an experimental film about Yanomami shamanism that was filmed during a meeting of 37 shamans at the Watoriki Reserve, Roraima, in March of 2011. The film was designed to take into account two different notions of image: those of the Yanomami and ours. Therefore, it does not set out to explain shamanism, its methods or procedures, but to allow different cultures to visualize and feel the way in which the shamans \u201cembody\u201d the spirits, their bodies and voices.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/af0IPOLYN0hgBRPZGSNtp8YhFVW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
