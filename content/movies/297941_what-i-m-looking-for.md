On an Internet dating site she writes: 'I'm looking for people who would like to be photographed in public revealing something of themselves...' What I'm Looking For, a 15-minute high definition video, documents this adventure; the connections formed at this intersection between virtual and actual public space. The video is a rumination on the nature of photography and the persistence of vision. It is a short tale of desire and control.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Shelley Silver ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
