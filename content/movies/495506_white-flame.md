Dekeukeleire transformed him into a butcher who commits an act of rebellion during a political demonstration at the foot of the Yser Tower (with authentic images of the 1930 meeting) which is being suppressed brutally by the authorities. White Flame secretes a drifting air of unreality straight out of Bu\u00f1uel, born out of 'carnal' close-ups and an editing style which owes a great deal to Soviet films of that period.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nwf2hiP1drvFgp8C5MnD4sdcJQd.jpg", "actors": ["Willem Rombauts ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
