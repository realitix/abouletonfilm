The film calls forth the spirit of one who was larger than life as recounted by those who knew her. Teiji Ito's family, Carolee Schneemann and Judith Malvina, float through the homes recalling in tiny bits and pieces words of Deren's architectural and personal interior space. Clips from Maya Deren's films are projected back into the spaces where they were originally filmed appearing on the floorboard, furniture, and in the bowl of her former sink. Fluid light projections of intimate space provide an elusive agency for a filmmaker most of us will never know as film with its imaginary nature evokes a former time and space.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8Fu5omGlkBSQOdcyzs4E1uq919i.jpg", "actors": ["Bekka Lindstrom (Maya Deren)", "Carolee Schneemann (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
