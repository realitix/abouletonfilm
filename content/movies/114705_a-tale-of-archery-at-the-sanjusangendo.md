Possessed of much raw talent, Kazuma is also very much a coward, holing himself up in an inn run by the kindly Okinu (Kinuyo Tanaka) and generally avoiding confrontation of any sort. Despite his clandestine manner, enough of the locals know of Kazuma\u2019s purpose and an attempt is made on his life. He is saved by Karatsu Kanbei (Kazuo Hasegawa), a samurai who offers to help Kazuma hone his archery skills, though it soon becomes clear that this apparently selfless stranger has several potentially shady ulterior motives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hSz32S9YqJNEVm2fMRorNZVD7hr.jpg", "actors": ["Kazuo Hasegawa (Kanbei Kanzamon)", "Kinuyo Tanaka (Okinu)", "Sensho Ichikawa (Daihachiro)", "Akitake K\u00f4no (Kazuma Hochino)", "Fumiko Katsuragi (Hoshino's mother)", "Haruo Tanaka (Seijiro)", "Unpei Yokoyama ()", "Tamae Kiyokawa (Omatsu)", "Kimiko Hayashi ()", "Sachiko Mitani ()", "Y\u00f4nosuke Toba ()", "Sabur\u00f4 Sawai ()", "Ryusaku Nagai ()", "Tokue Hanazawa ()", "Zenichiro Kito ()", "Taiz\u00f4 Fukami ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
