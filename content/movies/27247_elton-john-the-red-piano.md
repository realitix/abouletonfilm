One of the finest songwriters of the 20th century is well showcased on this DVD. The Red Piano's set list features some of Sir Elton John's best-known crowd pleasers and he delivers each performance with gusto. One can't help but get enraptured by his enthusiasm, and I found myself tapping my toes to a few tunes that I wouldn't even count among my favorites, ie: Benny and the Jets. There's something about seeing the songss performed live that makes them that much more engaging. Vocally, Elton is in excellent form, and though he modifies a few melodies (he doesn't hit the high notes like he used to - he leaves that to his back-up vocalists), his voice sounds rich and full.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jjVzVQIxI7PfWD2NosB6xupKJuO.jpg", "actors": ["Elton John (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
