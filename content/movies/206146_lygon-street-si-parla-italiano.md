Narrated by Anthony LaPaglia.  After the disaster of World War II, a wave of Italian immigrants found their way to Melbourne - a strange place, suspicious of outsiders and completely devoid of a good cup of espresso. Congregating in a then run-down stretch of Carlton known as Lygon Street, these irrepressible restaurateurs, entrepreneurs and sometime mafiosi would come to define not only a street, but an entire country.\r 'Lygon Street - Si parla Italiano' brings to life the people, places and, of course, pastas that have made up one of Australia's most remarkable communities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nKU5KE1w4xNz6DK1pSOkfyd1O5f.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
