Why did they wait until their 50's, 60's, or 70's to come out? And what was the turning point that caused each of these people finally to openly declare their sexuality? From Canada to Florida, to Kansas, we find out what ultimately led these dynamic individuals to make the liberating choice to pursue fully integrated lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zqQorSXoRtFvsPMUzU6uzuofar4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
