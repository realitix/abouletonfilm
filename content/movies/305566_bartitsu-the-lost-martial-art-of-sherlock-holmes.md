W. Barton-Wright combined jiujitsu, kickboxing, and stick fighting into the \"Gentlemanly Art of Self Defence\" known as Bartitsu.  After Barton-Wright's School of Arms mysteriously closed in 1902, Bartitsu was almost forgotten save for a famous, cryptic reference in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Adventure of the Empty House.  Hosted by Tony Wolf and featuring interviews with Harry Cook, Emelyne Godfrey, Mark Donnelly, Graham Noble, Neal Stephenson and Will Thomas, Bartitsu: the Lost Martial Art of Sherlock Holmes relates the fascinating history, rediscovery and revival of Barton-Wright's pioneering mixed martial art.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tc7e37bJSqa8hevYAkdDKCKIrXr.jpg", "actors": ["Neal Stephenson (Himself)", "Tony Wolf (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
