She must go through steps of happiness and sorrow, bonding and separation, having her hopes fulfilled and losing something she loves. Nevertheless, Kati has learned through these steps that the sorrow from her losses cannot take away her happiness she has received from her mother's love and bonding.

She knows who loves her, and who her love ones are.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8pNUHRR743TgFrX8sjggcNB4UBE.jpg", "actors": ["Passorn Khongmeesuk (Kati)", "Sa-Ard Piempongsan (Grandpa)", "Ratchanok Saeng-Xuto (Mom)", "Michael Shaowanasai (Uncle Tong)", "Kemapsorn Sirisukha (Aunt Chada)", "Krissada Sukosol (Uncle Kant)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "5bi5E5li-Vc"}
