Life has dealt his friend Hmida hard knocks. A countryside boy who moved to the city after his father repudiated him, he turned to petty larceny to survive, for which he served a sentence in prison. Hmida is jobless yet boisterous, while Miloud is skittish and disheartened by his friend\u2019s objectionable activities. When a wealthy entrepreneur who wields power in the neighborhood manages to evict the barber and his wife from the shop to build a centre for Koranic instruction, Hmida incites his friend to fight back. Deemed one of Moroccan cinema\u2019s underrated masterpieces, the film is infused with disarming realist grit. Adapted from a play by Youssef Fadel, a celebrated playwright, novelist and screenwriter, the film was Mohamed Reggab\u2019s only narrative feature. He incurred so much debt to finance the production that he even spent time in prison.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iG7ps2dXvmZin5E33Qg29npTQRO.jpg", "actors": ["Mohamed El Habachi ()", "Khadija Khamouli ()", "Omar Chenbod ()", "Hamid Najah ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
