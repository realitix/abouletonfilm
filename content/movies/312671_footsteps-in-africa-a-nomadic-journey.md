This film reveals their lives through their music, dance and culture. Using little dialogue or interview footage, the film instead shines a light on the rituals the Tuareg use to keep their culture alive and to remain in harmony with their environment.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
