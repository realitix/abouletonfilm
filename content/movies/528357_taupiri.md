Using a photographic still taken in 1992, of a lone cabbage tree, a custom-made filter was placed in front of the lens and maneuvered to bend and shape the light entering into the camera. The end result is a clustered, kaleidoscope effect of pixels moving like a comet across the screen, and illuminating the original photographic image.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
