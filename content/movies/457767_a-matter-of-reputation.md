A brilliant young pianist who in his youth expected him to climb to the top of world music and is now a dangerous and wanted criminal. A senior doctor in the hospital, a drug addict, who must wait patiently for surgery until his hands stop shaking. A young nurse whose parents, in which she nursed, abused her and lamented that she had to die in the place of her soldier brother. Everyone meets when a poor film producer arrives and invites the director out of the gutter and write a script for him. The film, as well as the screenplay written by the director, track these lost souls crossing each other's paths in the no-go paths in which they roam.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iEgRNmjVJle7D82blIfRBRNFFn1.jpg", "actors": ["Assi Dayan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
