The star runs the emotional gamut as Gabriela, who rises from the depths of poverty to the heights of Mexican society as a much-sought-after courtesan. Eventually, however, Gabriela proves that she is still true to her peasant heritage by casting her lot with the rebels in the 1916 Mexican civil war. Pedro Armendariz co-stars as Felipe, the charismatic rebel leader who wins Gabriela's heart - and inadvertently causes her downfall. La escondida is stunningly photographed by the late, great Gabriel Figueroa.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1ED4bYeWVZ1ZBA3qDjgbbCdtexk.jpg", "actors": ["Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix (Gabriela)", "Pedro Armend\u00e1riz (Felipe Rojano)", "Andr\u00e9s Soler (General Nemesio Garza)", "Arturo Mart\u00ednez (Don Cosme)", "Domingo Soler (Tata Agustino Rojano)", "Jorge Mart\u00ednez de Hoyos (M\u00e1ximo Tepal)", "Carlos Agost\u00ed (Coronel Octavio Moreno)", "Sara Guasch (Hortensia)", "Miguel Manzano (Don Chente)", "Carlos Riquelme (Doctor Herrer\u00edas)", "Eduardo Alcaraz (Se\u00f1or Ariza)", "Rafael Alcayde (Amo de hacienda)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
