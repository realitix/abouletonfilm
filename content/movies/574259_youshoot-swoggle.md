Join Swoggle as he fields your questions about everything from Vince, to The Muppets. This guy may be known as a \"bully\" to others, but he certainly learns to laugh at himself through the course of this appearance...especially as he begins to realize a bunch of these questions are coming from the boys with whom he spent his time in a certain large federation.  We will let you in on all the inside jokes that the boys have sent in to rattle Swoggle! Plus, the YouShoot games are here too, from the Ho Bag to Measuring Up!  Swoggle was a big YouShoot fan in the past...but can he watch THIS edition?!?!?!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Sean Oliver (Himself)", "Dylan Postl (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
