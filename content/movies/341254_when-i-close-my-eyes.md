Jump 20 years: the girl, now grown, lives with her aunt and has a job with the post office only because her dead uncle was a respected party leader. She's subbing at a small station when a robber strikes. He takes the loose cash; after he leaves, she finds lots more money in a metal box. She takes it. Suspicious police assign Ivan, who's from the council, to follow her. He does, trying to seduce her nightly during his surveillance. She sees the thief again by accident and makes contact.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aZwwzDtDQwht1l3sHanMXyKBrYp.jpg", "actors": ["Petra Rehar (Ana kot pun\u010dka)", "Petra Govc (Ana)", "Du\u0161an Sandak (Anin o\u010de)", "Ludvik Bagari (Mo\u017e iz govorilnice)", "Mario \u0160elih ()", "Berta Bojetu ()", "Drago Pavli\u010d ()", "Pavle Ravnohrib (Inspektor)", "Jo\u017eef Ropo\u0161a (Mili\u010dnik)", "Peter Musevski (Mili\u010dnik)", "Boris Trobec ()", "Dare Vali\u010d (Taksist)", "Mira Sardo\u010d (Teta)", "Jo\u017eica Avbelj (Tajnica na po\u0161ti)", "Du\u0161an Jovanovi\u0107 (\u0160ef po\u0161te)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
