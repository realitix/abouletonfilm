Having nowhere to turn in the wake of the Mexican revolution, they decide to raise him in the monastery, they name him Marcelino. The child grows into a rambunctious boy, fond of playing jokes on the friars but yearns for a mother as he observes the deep bond his best friend Eleuterio shares with his mother.
