Opposing himself to the current nature films that tend to highly compress time in order to end up with a concentrated sequence of action-elements Kristersson leaves rhythm and tempo almost completely up to the magpies themselves. With great integrity he filmed the daily, social and emotional life of a species of birds that has many points of contact with human life. Thus, the movie offers us the oppurtunity to view our own everyday existence through other eyes, from a world right above our heads, but yet so far away.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/acwkY9FMGWPSwSziiuY36ryEPY2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
