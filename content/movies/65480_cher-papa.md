Risi paints his portrait against a backdrop of an Italy where the new permissiveness has run rampant, traditional socio-cultural values have been usurped by consumerism, and the streets have become an open battleground for politically extremist groups (the '70s were dubbed \"The Years of Lead\" due to the great number of terrorist acts, and politically motivated assassinations).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p5PoZ2XqeY4QCVoMjfTA2EJyE1J.jpg", "actors": ["Vittorio Gassman ()", "Andr\u00e9e Lachapelle ()", "Aurore Cl\u00e9ment ()", "Stefano Madia ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [272008, 60225, 47449, 59088], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
