This film depicts the Battle through the eyes of Japanese and American soldiers who fought each other on the same battlefield, along with Okinawa civilians who were swept up in the fighting. The film also depicts the history of discrimination and oppression forced upon Okinawa by the American and Japanese governments. Carrying up to the current controversy over the construction of a new base at Henoko, the film explores the root causes of the widespread disillusionment and anger expressed by many Okinawans.  This ambitious documentary was directed by the American John Junkerman, long-term resident of Japan and Oscar-nominated documentary filmmaker. Okinawa: The Afterburn is a heartfelt plea for peace and an expression of deep respect for the unyielding spirit of the Okinawa people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3QFNHo5TeyUkD5u1j0aoeLtI3sr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "0D03LeeZe-U"}
