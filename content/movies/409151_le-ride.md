Many considered the entry of these courageous underdogs, racing as a team of 4 against teams of 10, a joke. One French journalist called their attempt nothing short of murder. 168 riders started the more than 3,500-mile race, only 41 finished. Surprisingly this remarkable story about the achievements of these brave athletes has never been told on film, until now. Phil Keoghan - television personality, adventurer and cycling enthusiast, retraces the 1928 Tour de France route, bringing history to life. Following the original course and schedule, riding a vintage bike, Phil and his team will average 150 miles a day for 22 stages.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s01m1ApPdsczyax1x1GgVfngLb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
