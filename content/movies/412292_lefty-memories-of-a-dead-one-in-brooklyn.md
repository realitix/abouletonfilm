Rehbein and his crew actually lived in the basement of a Brooklyn house owned by the parents of 'Brother Lou' [Louie Morales], the leader of 'The Sex Boys' (named after the street they hung out on, Essex -- after dropping the first two letters), filming many of that gang's most private moments.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2VmNbJWj5OUgdlpG9idjLDZ5ps7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
