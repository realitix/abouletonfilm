He strikes up a conversation with a good-looking young woman named Nisha, and tells her that there is a possible violation of Suppression of Immoral Trafficking Act taking place on this street. He witnesses several women soliciting men, and decides to call in the paddy wagon, and get them arrested. Alas, one of the men frequenting the prostitutes is none other than Ratan's superior officer, who immediately summons Ratan, and has him removed from service on corruption charges. Nisha takes pity on a homeless and unemployed Ratan, and asks him to live with her. He does not want her to sell her body, and so he decides to work at night, and during the day he takes on the guise of a rich Nawab and spends time with her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qPpR9W5Bee7sNapoGe4ECpEgaSI.jpg", "actors": ["Shammi Kapoor (Dhoop Chhaon)", "Sanjeev Kumar (Constable Ratan 'Sheru')", "Zeenat Aman (Nisha)", "Dev Kumar (Balram)", "Faryal (Lolita)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
