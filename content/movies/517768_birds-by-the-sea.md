AUgustin's (Philosopher and church teacher who lived during the transition from the Antique to the Middle Ages) words about the art of the Sequence, which at the time were refered to by the singers as a work of music, inspired me to undertake the attempt to produce a film, one which essentially reflects what Augusrin heard.
