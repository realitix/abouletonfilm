But when Tomomi announces her plans to marry - a man - Natsuko becomes inconsolable. While all this is taking place, Natsuko's straight male roommate is grappling with his own feelings for her, and a young high school girl comes to Tokyo searching for the mother that long ago left her for a female lover. Each character - queer, straight, male, female, young, old, and in-between - struggles to make peace with him/herself as all their lives overlap. This story captures the power of young love, and the web of the city.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qIlqhywe4yqCKCx4Hfs2zJKcVxT.jpg", "actors": ["Erika Okuda (Tomomi)", "Mina Shimizu (Natsuko)", "S\u00f4 Sakamoto (Koji)", "Ry\u00fbnosuke Kawai (Kenta)", "Aya Omasa (Kana)", "Maki Sawa (mama)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [62390, 74175], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
