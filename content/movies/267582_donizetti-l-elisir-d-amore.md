Felice Romani wrote the Italian libretto, after Eug\u00e8ne Scribe's libretto for Daniel Auber's Le philtre (1831).  Written in haste in a six-week period,[1] L'elisir d'amore was the most often performed opera in Italy between 1838 and 1848[1] and it has remained continually in the international opera repertory. Today it is one of the most frequently performed of all Donizetti's operas: it appears as number 13 on the Operabase list of the most-performed operas worldwide in the five seasons between 2008 and 2013.[2] There are a large number of recordings. It contains the popular tenor aria \"Una furtiva lagrima,\" a romanza that has a considerable performance history in the concert hall.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qvVOsvDksSTWxdFIfdns8Yzb6WS.jpg", "actors": ["Roberto Alagna (Nemorino)", "Angela Gheorghiu (Adina)", "Simone Alaimo (Dulcamara)", "Roberto Scaltriti (Belcore)", "Elena Dan (Gianetta)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
