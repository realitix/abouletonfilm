When their goofy pal Daisy Baker (Joan Davis) passes off a discarded Portuguese play manuscript as her own, producer Rupert Shannon (Emory Parnell) agrees to bankroll the production. With stars in their eyes, Gloria and Maria pretend to be a pair of Portuguese musical comedy stars, thereby winning parts in the new production. The fun begins when the play's original authors sell the same manuscript to a rival producer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rK34Jw3zush9zFsR4C4YhvhcmQp.jpg", "actors": ["Joan Davis (Daisy Baker)", "Jinx Falkenburg (Gloria)", "Ann Savage (Maria)", "Leslie Brooks (Lena Worth)", "Ramsay Ames (Louise Hotchkiss)", "Bob Haymes (Jeff Kenyon)", "Emory Parnell (Rupert Shannon)", "Douglas Leavitt (Sam Grohman)", "Muni Seroff (Gilberto Garcia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
