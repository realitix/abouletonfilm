Anyone who has ever had the distinct pleasure of seeing the band live knows that the virtuoso musicianship and incredible vocals are on full display in this setting. By this time, drummer Pat Torpey's battle with Parkinson's Disease had been made public, but Pat toured with the band regardless and sat behind the drum kit for select songs, while also providing background vocals, tambourine, etc. on other tracks when Matt Starr was taking his turn on the kit.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/17O4Bz0x3leqe9OjkONHS6UidnK.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Gilbert (Guitar)", "Billy Sheehan (Bass)", "Pat Torpey (Drums)", "Eric Martin (Vocals)", "Mr. Big ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
