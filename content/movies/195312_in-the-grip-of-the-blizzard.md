The camera was stationed at the corner of Broadway and Fourteenth Street, and was swept in almost a complete circle, showing the tremendous drifts of snow and the blockade at 'Dead Man's Curve' in Fourteenth Street. This picture was taken during the busiest time of the day, and shows to what extent New York City was tied up by this tremendous fall of snow.\" (AMB Picture Catalogue (1902)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lX54qqesXnoTnflA885B6uP9ybz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [331194, 211244, 156532, 257906], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
