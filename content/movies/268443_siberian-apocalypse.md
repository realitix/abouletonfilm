At 7.15 am, on 30th June 1908, a giant fireball, as bright the sun, exploded in the sky over Tunguska in central Siberia. Its force was equivalent to twenty million tonnes of TNT, and a thousand times greater than that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. An estimated sixty million trees were felled over an area of over two thousand square kilometres - an area over half the size of Rhode Island. If the explosion had occurred over London or Paris, hundreds of thousands of people would have been killed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aoC5YL0i8zEccPzyHoHjJTJ4gJb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
