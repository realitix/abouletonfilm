I got to know the women, took my Bolex (a wind-up camera) and after a while I felt comfortable enough to start filming. It made me aware of the way in which documentaries can be a form of control. On the one hand, it was a straightforward documentary and, on the other, it questioned my role as maker. It took a long time to make and was extremely rigorous.\u201d (Alia Syed)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/huwkmB209en8sr1PMzt6GZ367cC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
