Starting at the bottom, just as a real trainee would have done on BR, Arfon first becomes a cleaner then gradually progresses up the ladder with ex-Fireman Ray Martin teaching him the art of firing.  Ex-BR Driver Bill Gwilt then takes over to explain how to oil and prepare the loco followed by how to drive. Arfon then takes the controls of Clun Castle in charge of a seven coach \u201cexpress\u201d running from Loughborough Central to Rothley.  If you have ever wondered how a steam engine works or how they are maintained or driven, this best selling video is for you.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6nhxsnvkbOa4YfpMYRVKeY8FAEg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
