Outsourcing of the subcontractors for a poor country to another are not without consequences. With the awareness of workers and soaring prices, social stability of these countries is no longer guaranteed. The protests and walkouts multiply. Facing the dull anger but rising of these workers, the authorities can not remain inert. This documentary describes the increasing power of a new protest generation of workers, younger, and less docile. To discuss this problem, this film survey examines the question of social relationships in Chinese companies, including Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics giant, which is the largest employer in China.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gOtAWuY9nTfVWaxtsisMNSOQSsn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
