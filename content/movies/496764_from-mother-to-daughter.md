As the film unfurls, it reveals an astonishing and colorful truth: a number of the women subsequently formed a singing ensemble during their golden years, and decided to tour Italy in that outfit, regularly performing the folks songs of their youth that majestically re-evoke that time. As the women congregate and talk on-camera, revealing their colorful, magnetic personalities, they tell detailed and evocative tales of the past and of the emotions they initially experienced.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f4mIodyUVeClcs5tDlAeIeJAflM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
