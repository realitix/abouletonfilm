In 1936 he purchased a sound-on-film 16mm camera and began to make talking pictures. The result is that we can not only see what Archie saw but hear what he heard. Stewart primarily focused on his family, watching them grow and mature as the years passed. Here we partake in four years of family activities, trips, and holiday seasons, as well as technical experiments. The record, intimate and endearing, shows people comfortable in front of the ever-present camera and microphone.\u201d \u2014 Bruce Posner", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gRAPO8VzRJ74hXNbNxFvhIMBEvm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
