The film was made using only the timing tapes that corrected the color for a Hollywood feature, the identity of which Honda does not know. Devoid of images and deeply meditative, Color Correction offers a timely insistence on the indispensable nature of this great medium.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iudVRP95fwJPAhwsraXEH5nk9vd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
