Among the topics Bill discusses in his ninth HBO solo special are: Whether the \"Great Recession\" is really over; the fake patriotism of the right wing; what goes on in the mind of a terrorist; why Obama needs a posse instead of the secret service; the drug war; Michael Jackson; getting out of Iraq and Afghanistan; racism; the Teabagger movement; religion; the health-care fight; why Gov. Mark Sanford will come out looking good, and how silly it is to ask \"Why do men cheat?\"; and why comedy most definitely didn't die when George Bush left office.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dAPT89WS1Lx81tfqHQMNqxlQKJx.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Maher (Himself)", "Maureen MacDonald ()", "Caitlin Mathis (Burqa Girl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [17229, 68370, 21576, 158846], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
