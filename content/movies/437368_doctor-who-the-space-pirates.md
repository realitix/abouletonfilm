The travellers find themselves trapped in a sealed section of the beacon. It is blown apart and flown to where the pirates will plunder it of the precious mineral argonite. They witness a conflict between the pirates and the Interstellar Space Corps, led by General Hermack and Major Warne.  The ISC are convinced that the pirates' mastermind is an innocent yet eccentric space mining pioneer named Milo Clancey, while their true leader is a man named Caven. Caven has a secret base on the planet Ta. He is assisted by Madeleine Issigri, daughter of Clancey's ex-partner Dom, who - unknown to her - is now his captive.  When Madeleine discovers Caven's full treachery, she helps to bring him to justice. The time travellers are given a lift back to the TARDIS by Clancey in his rickety old ship, the LIZ 79.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nZZgarHPGz2bTMFy57gtEYKfclr.jpg", "actors": ["Patrick Troughton (The Doctor)", "Frazer Hines (Jamie McCrimmon)", "Wendy Padbury (Zoe Heriot)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
