We see the tale through the eyes of a modern young girl, the oldest child in a large rural Tex-Mex family. During a surrealistic dream, which brings to mind \"The Wizard of Oz,\" the young chicana makes a fantastical journey with the shepherds and along the way; witnesses the triumph of God's Angels over Satan's diablo's. Full of drama, comedy, fantasy and wonderful music; this is a rare film the whole family can enjoy together.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AmhI4VDzZ46hJNRYWQumOotorqB.jpg", "actors": ["Cheech Marin (El Cosmico)", "Linda Ronstadt (San Miguel)", "Paul Rodr\u00edguez (Satanas)", "Robert Beltran (Luzbel)", "Le\u00f3n Singer  (El Hermitano)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "MJ-r058w5OY"}
