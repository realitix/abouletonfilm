That's fortunate for Misao, because her onimitsu talents may be all that keeps her alive when a journey in search of the leader of the clan, Aoshi Shinomori, leads her instead into a face-to-face encounter with an even more dangerous man and a plot to overthrow the Meiji government!  Quickly enmeshed in the affairs of the legendary assassin Hitokiri Battosai, now known as Kenshin Himura, wielder of the reverse-blade sword, Misao finds herself pulled into the middle of a deadly intrigue against Makoto Shishio, who is orchestrating the conquest of all Japan - beginning with Kyoto!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m70FuHpIOdyijPaMpKEKTqArS1N.jpg", "actors": ["Mayo Suzukaze (Kenshin Himura)", "Yuji Ueda (Sanosuke Sagara)", "Miki Fujitani (Kaoru Kamiya)", "M\u00eena Tominaga (Yahiko Myoujin)", "Masanori Ikeda (Makoto Shishio)", "Tomo Sakurai (Misao Makimachi)", "Ken Narita (Hajime Saito)", "Yoshito Yasuhara (Aoshi Shinomori)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [210227], "youtube_key": "STh1zljsEdU"}
