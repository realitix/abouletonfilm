Originally titled, \"Close The Door, I'm Shooting...Dead Is Dead,\" this was Cambridge's labor of love. He famously took a detour in his career to speak at colleges, poaching the evils of heroin.  The content of Dead is Dead is as coldly matter-of-fact as the title. Produced by actor Godfrey Cambridge, this informational video discusses drug addiction: its causes and its possible cures. Several real-life addicts are shown fighting their addiction by going through rehab therapy. This 21-minute reality dose is not designed to be pretty: Cambridge deals with a tough subject with commensurate toughness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uWHy1V138lQcy2uHfA4G6mbuoiQ.jpg", "actors": ["Godfrey Cambridge (Host - Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
