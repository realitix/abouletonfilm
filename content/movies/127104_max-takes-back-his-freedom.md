He is ecstatic, dancing a jig at the prospect of new-found freedom, but after a series of disasters as he washes up the dishes, shops and cooks, makes his bed and tries to get a night's sleep, then looks unsuccessfully for his tie in the morning, he's at his wit's end and the place is in shambles. Will his better half return?
