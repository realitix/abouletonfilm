This peeking into their homes begins when Shir, Noy's younger sister, comes to visit him from the Kibbutz, when he'd rather throw her onto Mike - the perfect host. At his apartment, she is introduced to his anonymous blog on the Internet - an ongoing story in the first person, about a special air-hostess who lives in the shadows of the city, a bit like the author who invented her. Shir suggests giving her face to the storyteller, thus forcing Mike out of his self-afflicted anonymity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/586QJKI6oAHbBUYFQemb2j0ZRNA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
