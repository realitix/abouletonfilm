Their Sgt Major is not happy about this and orders them to take the balloon down, but a freak heavy wind accidentally carries the gang away to Nazi Germany. They are captured and placed in a detention camp where they meet an elderly prisoner named Jerry, who possess a map  for the location of a secret weapon which will win the war! Fortunately Teddy Knox's impersonation of Hitler lands him the spot of pretending to be the Fuhrer at a gala dinner and the gang are allowed out of the camp. However the Nazis have other ideas for their substitute leader.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e4VQOwiZlEWQdt706HrWYTjK72N.jpg", "actors": ["Bud Flanagan (Bud)", "Chesney Allen (Ches)", "Jimmy Nervo (Cecil)", "Teddy Knox (Teddy)", "Charlie Naughton (Charlie)", "Jimmy Gold (Jimmy)", "Moore Marriott (Jerry)", "Wally Patch (Sgt Major)", "Peter Gawthorne (Commanding Officer)", "Frederick Valk (Sturmfuehrer)", "Eric Clavering (Sturmfuehrer)", "Anthony Eustrel (Gestapo Officer)", "Carl Jaffe (Gestapo Chief)", "Manning Whiley (O.P.
