Upon learning that a local catskin dealer intends to buy up all the local felines, the boys organize a boycott against the man. It's a uphill climb, since the dealer has the law and the government on his side, having spread a rumor that the cats were diseased and needed to be killed off. Thanks to the boys, who aren't above a little larceny and duplicity themselves, the villain is foiled and the world made safe for meowers and mousers once more. Kampf der Tertia is based on a popular children's novel by Wilhelm Speyer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eujErO5dodfYhStjl0raOEoP3NQ.jpg", "actors": ["Brigitte Rau (Daniela)", "Wolfgang Jansen (Borst)", "Rolf Weih (Dr.Frey)", "G\u00fcnther Jerschke (Dr.Grau)", "Charles Brauer (Tertianer)", "Helmuth Rudolph (Schuldirektor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
