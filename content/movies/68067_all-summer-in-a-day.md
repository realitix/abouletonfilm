Set on a planet where the sun shines for just a few minutes once every nine years, this is a classic tale of suffering and forgiveness. A classroom full of young children are excited to hear that today the rain will stop. However, they are also resentful of a new classmate from Earth who remembers what it's like to see the sun.  \"This gripping, unsettling production softens the original story\u2019s abrupt conclusion without diminishing its punch. A masterful work.\" - Booklist. Winner of a CINE Golden Eagle, and honored by Instructor Magazine as one of the 25 Best Films of the Year.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/25xUUsX89M97vVpsyxOBWSh1CJh.jpg", "actors": ["Reesa Mallen (Margot)", "Tammy Simpson (Paula)", "Jerry Marshak (Michael)", "Bridget Meade (Lisa)", "Edith Fields (Mrs. Callaghan)", "Keith Coogan (William)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "veKSWIGHa6Q"}
