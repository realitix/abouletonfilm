Today, however, Kabir is no longer a cop. In fact, he seems to be doing rather well for himself, driving a Mercedes, working out of a plush office and living in a lavish villa. Naturally, the lads are keen to have some of that, so they promptly bribe Kabir into making them his business partners. What they don't realise is that Kabir has a hidden agenda, shared only with his sexy wife Kamini (Mallika Sherawat) and lovely sister, Kiya (Kangana Ranaut). Before long, the two sides are locked into a game of one-upmanship, with loads of cash at stake. But who will have the last laugh?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ysGYrjeAdIXZULLVdGzwliqGHyU.jpg", "actors": ["Sanjay Dutt (Kabir Nayak)", "Arshad Warsi (Adi / Ghanta Singh)", "Ritesh Deshmukh (Roy / Lee / Heera Bhai / Tukya \"Kale\" Ram)", "Aashish Chaudhary (Boman / Barbara Hori)", "Javed Jaffrey (Manav / Jojo)", "Mallika Sherawat (Kamini / Jalebi Bai)", "Kangana Ranaut (Kiya Nayak)", "Satish Kaushik (Baba Batanand Swami)", "Harry Josh (Johnny Banzola)", "Zakir Hussain (Mohsin Bhai)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [20413, 20359, 117784, 20971], "youtube_key": "zkIfgcl0sG0"}
