The camera documents a group of 20 people gathered in a hall to perform. The cast includes real-life performers whose skills range from the mundane to the extraordinary: a hula hooper, a singer, a pizza dough thrower, speed skippers, tap dancers, gymnasts and dog trainers. Two men make salami, a woman gets a haircut and someone eats too many hotdogs. Hrabluik\u2019s editing creates an exquisite corpse, connecting the performers as their bodies tap out a spellbinding rhythm.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
