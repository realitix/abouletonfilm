George arrives but his manager Dolan is nowhere to be found. But Ma and Pa Karlsen, owners of Karlsen's Kozy Kottages motel and restaurant take him under their wing. He meets Miss Gormley who is also there to meet the no-show manager who is blackmailing her brother. Dolan still hasn't arrived by the date of the fight but, to the surprise of sports-promoters Tom Healy and Dominic Guido, George shows up and wins the fight. This wins him the friendship of trainer Al Muntz and the enmity of Willie Foltis, a punchy ex-fighter and a Healy henchman. This leads George to a fight with \"Soldier\" Freeman, whose manager Scotty Cameron has made arrangements for the favored-Freeman to take a dive, so he and Healy and Guido can clean up betting on the underdog. But Honest George has other plans.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9jzGNABNUk8i9v4ba125yCscKMb.jpg", "actors": ["Alex Nicol (George Wilson)", "Audrey Totter (Miss Peggy Gormley)", "Charles Winninger (Pa Karlsen)", "Hope Emerson (Ma Karlsen)", "Joseph Wiseman (Dominic Guido)", "Barry Kelley (Tom Healy)", "Harry Morgan (Al Muntz)", "Jesse White (Willie Foltis)", "Horace McMahon (Sam Benton)", "Grant Withers (Scott Cameron)", "Dick Wessel ('Speedtrap' Calhoun)", "Hal Baylor ('Soldier' Freeman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
