With the steady shot of a Gotham-like cityscape, Lukas Marxt guides us between vestiges of visionary architecture and narrow planted apartment buildings. As we\u2019re searching for our relational point within it, the overwhelming murmuring of the human, car, and boat traffic, at the same time marginalises our position.
