While the seemingly low-key band takes to the road in some fairly exotic places, it demonstrates during live performances of the jangly \"Quicksand,\" the hard-rocking \"Megalomaniac,\" and dramatic \"Anna Molly\" that vocalist Brandon Boyd, guitarist Mike Einziger, bassist Dirk Lance, and drummer Jose Pasillas are close to mastering their ever-developing penchant for radical tonal shifts within songs.  A novel element on this disc is travel footage from the band\u2019s tour, including images from Israel, Dubai, London, and peculiarly beautiful, surreal shots of Iceland.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/crWEk7iuqsXlYPXo9UjuJCHRg3o.jpg", "actors": ["Brandon Boyd (Lead Vocals, Rhythm Guitar, Percussion)", "Mike Einziger (Lead Guitar, Piano, Backing Vocals)", "Jose Pasillas II (Drums)", "Chris Kilmore (Turntables, Keyboards)", "Ben Kenney (Bass Guitar, Backing Vocals)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
