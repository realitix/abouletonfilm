Seven long years later, Hayabusa achieved its goal and was the first of any kind of craft launched from Earth to safely return samples of this kind to home base. The story was one of such great national pride for Japan, and in the wake of the tsunami and resulting tragedies in Japan it\u2019s strong nationalistic message became the subject of no less than three rival films. Yukihiko Tsutsumi\u2019s high-profile effort, simply titled Hayabusa (2011) starred the incomparable Toshiyuki Nishida.  Most recently, Welcome Home, Hayabusa (2012) was released to Japanese audiences. Slipping in between those two was Hayabusa: The Long Voyage Home, concentrating on the people on the ground who helped return the probe safely.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ndeP5YnTbfjr5EULibERhfZnkF3.jpg", "actors": ["Ken Watanabe (Junichiro Kawaguchi)", "Yosuke Eguchi (Hitoshi Fujinaka)", "Yui Natsukawa (Mari Inoue)", "Yukiyoshi Ozawa (Etsuya Kamata)", "Yuri Nakamura (Natsuko Matsumoto)", "Hidetaka Yoshioka (Yasuo Moriuchi)", "Renji Ishibashi (Haruo Kinoshita)", "Tatsuya Fuji (Yasunobu Marukawa)", "Tsutomu Yamazaki (Hiroshi Higashide)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
