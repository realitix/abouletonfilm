Three elementary school pals, separated during the post-Tiananmen wave of emigration, reunite after 20 years, only to find themselves in totally different places. When each of them gets involved in an unlikely and at times illicit romance, their disparate lives intertwine and take a dire turn. The simmering ennui of post-handover Hong Kong is insightfully captured in this original and hardhitting drama about love, deceit and betrayal.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6imVYa9VsHUaaOpThYyA1T3Sz9Y.jpg", "actors": ["Kelvin Kwan (Sing)", "Chui Tien-You (Lok)", "Christopher Goh (Adam)", "Candy Law Lum (Linda)", "Mandy Lieu (Julie)", "Joy Sheng (Snowy)", "Michael Chugani (Himself)", "Snow Suen (Teacher)", "Mimi Kung (Lok's mother)", "Cheung Kwok-Keung ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "_v16qYGcbmU"}
