The intention of the film is to share through the eyes of the girl, the sequences shot by the father, which showed his patriarchal and colonialist point of view, his images of himself and his sexual fantasies. In this sense, it is a film about the problematic relationship, libidinous as well as critical, between a father and his daughter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/28zyni7ecaOXXX70ukaaaFr33Mi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
