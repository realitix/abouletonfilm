It is as much \"What could have been\" as it is \"What really happened.\" In other words, it is historical fiction - fiction being the keyword. It spans a few genres; it is slick, fast-paced, realistic and, importantly, very funny.In this \"smart comedy\" set in 1999, all the characters are found by a common feeling of being stuck at 99 in life - just one short of a 'century' - that elusive thing called \"making it\" in life!99 is an unpredictable and hilarious ride spread over two cities with colorful characters, unbelievable circumstances, small-time crooks, big-time conspiracies, fateful car crashes, loads of coffee, a briefcase full of money, a budding romance....... And a historical controversy brewing in the background!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cvhM9kk26zkVGUrd147aITrx2qi.jpg", "actors": ["Kunal Khemu (Sachin)", "Boman Irani (Rahul)", "Soha Ali Khan (Pooja)", "Cyrus Broacha (Zaramud)", "Simone Singh (Jahnavi)", "Mahesh Manjrekar (AGM)", "Amit Mistry (Kuber)", "Vinod Khanna (JC)", "Sudesh Berry (Sunil Mehta)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [61271, 25510, 19620, 20092], "youtube_key": "ZXXSWxg-D4k"}
