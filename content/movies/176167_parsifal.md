The action is centered around Wagner's death mask. Kundry (played by the German actress Edith Clever and sung by Yvonne Minton) is the main character - one might read the film as the story of her redemption rather than that of Amfortas.  Made entirely in a studio (in 1981 and released in 1983), it is characterized by long takes, slowly moving camera that breaths with the music and varies between close-ups and long shots to emphasize the drama.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cAicVndmwUKym9SNGeE1Zwa5qES.jpg", "actors": ["Armin Jordan ()", "Wolfgang Sch\u00f6ne ()", "Martin Sperr ()", "Hans Tschammer ()", "Robert Lloyd ()", "Michael Kutter ()", "Karin Krick ()", "Reiner Goldberg ()", "Aage Haugland ()", "Edith Clever ()", "Yvonne Minton ()", "Gertrud Oertel ()", "Paul Frey ()", "Gilles Cachemaille ()", "Tamara Herz ()", "Hanna Schaer ()", "Christer Bladin ()", "Michael Roider ()", "Britt-Marie Aruhn ()", "Jocelyne Chamonin ()", "Eva Saurova ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
