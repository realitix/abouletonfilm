When Orlando enters, he is a man clearly torn between his love of fame and his love for Angelica. \"Orlando teaches all of us that love is often responsible for our loss of reason,\" runs a line from Act 3 of the opera. It is a modest moral, and perhaps one not demanding of the dramatic finesse and musical diversity that Handel serves up in Orlando - for the opera's complex of problems is rather more complicated than that. Beneath the fabric of this masterfully woven constellation of characters and values is a score of such independence and vivacity as to give Orlando a special position among Handel's works - indeed among opera literature in general.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s45ZeeMXbWAeJAN9d0ZD7qCpWHY.jpg", "actors": ["Katharina Peetz (Medoro)", "Marijana Mijanovic (Orlando)", "Christina Clark (Dorinda)", "Martina Jankov\u00e1 ()", "Konstantin Wolff ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
