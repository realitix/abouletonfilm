Legendary performers Mike Ranger, Serena, Bill Margold, Uschi Digard and Leslie Bovee bring all their bad jokes and hot cavorting right to your seat, up close and personal. (There's even a cameo by the impossible-to-overlook John Holmes.) If you're interested in a plot, it's a thinly veiled satire of Casablanca, from the jilted lover still carrying a torch to a happening nightclub with a house singer\u2014all with a sexual spin on the action, of course. 3-D glasses provided. Also known as Blonde Emanuelle. Directed by Stephen Gibson (credited as Norm De Plume).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yHE4XW0wg1dli5OtfEoXqvszUUo.jpg", "actors": ["Serena (Jennifer)", "Ingrid Irvin (Mona)", "Mike Ranger (Chick Weed)", "Lesllie Bovee (Laura)", "William Margold (Harry Baulls)", "Uschi Digard (Anna)", "Con Covert (Inspector)", "John Holmes (Orgy Guy (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
