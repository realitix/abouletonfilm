In the course of devising this scent, Zazel variously paints pictures, views photographs, and wanders among the flowers of her garden, each experience inspiring her to envision a powerful sexual fantasy. The film consists of nearly a dozen individually themed sequences which reference and recreate iconography drawn from mythology, religion, literature, film and even Jungian psychology. These include sirens, water nymphs, mermaids, flowers, the jungle, The Three Musketeers, classic old Hollywood movies, angels and demons, and the Jungian duality of male and female.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ypErY8wcKQQdERAXtMhNhKcx55S.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
