The actors share wild stories from the set that you'll have to hear to believe. Inter-cut with clips from the film, it follows Hobgoblins' journey from low-budget straight to video feature, to Mystery Science Theater 3000 hit, to becoming voted one of the worst films of all time. Hysterically funny, the actors don't hold anything back.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
