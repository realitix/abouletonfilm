The burning of the peat forests throughout tropical Southeast Asia creates pollution, and this posed significant challenges to human health and the economies of the region during the second decade of the 21st century. The problem of peat haze pollution has been somewhat mitigated in recent years but in spite of this positive progress a few of the critical issues are yet to be solved. A complete solution to this complex issue will not be a simple one.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yfdzdu7hGO1BNcSiLzsEeaPqCyf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
