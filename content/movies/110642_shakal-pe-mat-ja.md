The four suspects are Ankit Sharma, his school-going brother, Dhruv; Rohan Goverdhan Malhotra, and Bulai. The suspects ridicule them and mockingly ask the guards to let them go. A check of their belongings, including a video camera, shows pictures of prominent places, prompting Om Prakash to summon Vijay D. Chauhan, from the Anti-Terrorist Squad. The latter shows up, is initially skeptical, but after he overhears a rather incriminating conversation between Ankit and a woman named Prachi, is convinced that the four may be terrorists and interrogates them. The four steadfastly deny their involvement in any terrorist activity - but must face up to the situation when a fifth suspect, a woman named Diana, claims that they belong to her group - which has already made plans to blow up the airport today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pE0SFeO09BuSFI9YpRHxU8tx1Wu.jpg", "actors": ["Umang Jain (Prachi)", "Aamna Shariff (Diana)", "Saurabh Shukla (Vijay Dinanath Chauhan)", "Raghuvir Yadav (Om Prakash)", "Zakir Hussain (Omama)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "OQlsQgcNMJs"}
