A legendary Drag King Night in New York is the point of departure for an odyssey to transgendered worlds, where women become men - some for a night, others for their whole lives. What motivates them? What changes take place? What do they dream of? The drag kings of New York meet in clubs and change lustfully into their male alter egos, parodying them and exploring male eroticism and power strategies. In London we see women experiment with hormones to become new men and 'cyborgs'. Masculinity and transformation as performance, subversion or existential necessity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5aOpGyZxcFwkL3449nih3zpjtTh.jpg", "actors": ["Diane Torr (Him/Herself)", "Dr\u00e9d Gerestant (Himself/Herself)", "Del La Grace Volcano (Himself)", "Queen Bee Luscious (Himself/Herself)", "Mistress Formika (Himself/Herself)", "Mo Fischer ()", "Philly Abe ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
