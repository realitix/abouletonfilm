Add to that: ever-younger boys with 24-7 access to hard-core Internet porn. It saturates their lives - from skate parks to the school bus - 80 percent of boys 10 to 18 are watching porn on smart phones. Toss social media into the mix: and kids not only can consume X-rated images, but produce them. Sexting has become a grade seven right of passage. The powder keg that is porn culture has exploded in our kid's lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bUvzl8hLh9xZnBN7sIYeDRKr5Ak.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
