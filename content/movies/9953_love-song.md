As the story progresses, the truth is slowly revealed.\r\n\r\n\u201cA Love Song for Bobby Long\u201d (2004) is a sluggish, sometimes humorous drama set in The Big Easy with lotsa poetry & prose, as well as jazz, blues and folk. It\u2019s very literature-quoting in the manner of flicks like \u201cDead Poets Society\u201d (1989), \u201cFinding Forrester\u201d (2000), \u201cThe Squid and the Whale\u201d (2005) and numerous Woody Allen flicks.\r\n\r\nWhile the story is lethargic and lacks the drive of \u201cDead Poets Society,\u201d there\u2019s something to be said for an intelligent American film that dares to take its time and is filled with verbiage that assumes the viewer is well-read. Plus the story perks up in the final act and cutie Johansson is always a pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 59 minutes and was shot in New Orleans & Gretna, Louisiana.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"}], "recommandations_id": [11671, 3877, 1901, 15184], "youtube_key": "4ve-nxuX_sg"}
