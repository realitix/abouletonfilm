The government deployed its troops, and at least 145 people died in the ensuing battle. Fighting for indigenous Mexicans to regain control over their lives and the land, the Zapatistas and their charismatic leader, guerilla poet Subcomandante Marcos, began sending their message to the world via the Internet. The result was what THE NEW YORK TIMES called \"the world\u2019s first postmodern revolution.\" Years into the uprising, filmmaker Nettie Wild traveled to the jungle canyons of southern Mexico to film the elusive and fragile life of the rebellion. Her camera effectively and movingly captures the personal stories behind a very public clash of traditional culture and globalization.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4j9U7QMT5D5HhUoIsoAI1niVqz8.jpg", "actors": ["Subcommandante Marcos (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [16423, 58772, 68200], "youtube_key": "qsYO2x5RSaw"}
