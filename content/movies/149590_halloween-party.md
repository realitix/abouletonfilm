Not only has she dated everyone there; unbeknownst to her, Ben has invited her lame ex-boyfriend in hopes of reuniting them. As she spends the night avoiding her ex, and the other undesirable guys in attendance, she interacts with a colorful assortment of party peeps. Between disappearing fortune tellers and over crowded jacuzzis, she questions if real love is even possible. The irony; the only person she's the least bit attracted to, is the homeless man!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b4C3G36icIj1pfdD3I6QON6A2iq.jpg", "actors": ["Elle Newlands (Erin / Studfinder)", "Frank Gangarossa (Mason / Homeless Guy)", "Chris Pentzell (Ben / Dr. Ben Dover)", "Christine Blackburn (Julie / Dryad)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
