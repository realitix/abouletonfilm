Alors que la plupart de ses copines de lyc\u00e9e passent leur temps sur Internet ou au centre commercial, Juno ne fait rien comme les autres. C'est ainsi qu'un jour o\u00f9 elle s'ennuie, elle couche avec Bleeker, gar\u00e7on aussi charmant que peu pr\u00e9tentieux.Mais quand elle tombe enceinte accidentellement, elle d\u00e9cide de trouver le couple de parents adoptifs id\u00e9al qui pourra s'occuper de son b\u00e9b\u00e9.

She is not like disrepectful or anything, she just knows who she is and what she likes, even though she thinks that she haven't figured it out yet. She totally has.\r\n\r\nJuno gets pregnant with Bleeker. She thinks about getting an abortion, as it will be the responsible thing to do, but can't get herself to do it (I mean, the kid already has fingernails!), instead she finds a cool couple to adopt the child (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman).\r\n\r\nJuno is a movie about being a kid and growing up, about taking responsibility for your life and doing the right thing, even though it's damn hard. I mean, imagine being a pregnant teen on your school... you think people would talk about you? Well, they do... a lot. Also, imagine how your parents would react and how you would react to giving it up, whether its abortion or adoption.\r\n\r\nAnyways, Juno is cool and takes everything as it comes. She'll figure it out eventually, we know this the minute we see her. Nothing will break Juno.\r\n\r\nEllen Page is amazing as Juno, and the rest of the cast is so carefully casted that it's not even funny. Everyone understands their part and while the dialogue is a little movie-ish all the way through, it is also terrible believeable. These people speak this way because they... know themselves and don't give a damn what anyone else thinks.\r\n\r\n_Last words... if you haven't yet, go watch this movie. You don't even need to be a teenager to get it... this is a movie for everyone, boy or girl, man or woman, age 12 or 68. Don't miss out on Juno, she is worth every minute._"}], "recommandations_id": [773, 4964, 401, 1262]}
