You\u2019ll see more or less normal, hardworking people, not so different from you or me. You\u2019ll laugh along with Jasmine Arabia, Nikita Bellucci, Jessie Volt and their fellow actresses. Because believe it or not, the world of porn can be fun. It goes without saying you\u2019ll be a voyeur, but that\u2019s perfectly natural. Along the way, you\u2019ll gradually start questioning your own relationship to sexuality. The film shows everything, avoiding judgment, pathos and big moral issues, a first for this type of film. The answers to your questions will come naturally, without the slightest prompting from the filmmakers. Like a feel-good movie strictly prohibited to minors that will appeal to your adventurous side.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lV970dE2mtK4bZVxeA6p2buz2i0.jpg", "actors": ["Jasmine Arabia ()", "Nikita Bellucci ()", "Jessie Volt ()", "Tiffany Doll ()", "Titof ()", "Mike Angelo ()", "Tristan Lust ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
