Little Edie, in her 50s, who wears scarves and bright colors, sings, mugs for the camera, and talks to Al and David Maysles, the filmmakers. Big Edie, in her 70s, recites poetry, comments on her daughter's behavior, and sings \"If I Loved You\" in fine voice. She talks in short sentences; her daughter in volumes. The film is episodic: friends visit, there's a small fire in the house, Little Edie goes to the shore and swims. She talks about the Catholic Church. She's ashamed that local authorities raided the house because of all the cats. She values being different.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eWnlLimzh9y8TdsYemMJ1da9XiS.jpg", "actors": ["Edith Bouvier Beale (Herself)", "Albert Maysles (Himself)", "David Maysles (Himself)", "Jerry Torre (Himself)", "Lois Wright (Herself)", "Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [43858, 35986, 86956, 17346], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
