In this hilarious DVD, Strassman truly ventures down the rabbit hole. Alternate realities? Parallel universes? It\u2019s a mind-bending journey into a world where nothing is as it seems. Chuck Wood and Ted E. Bare have been cracking up audiences for years, but this DVD is an even funner, darker, all-new creation from the dark and twisted mind of David Strassman.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iBywyewUMtjiezpFCRvCJH7ufWX.jpg", "actors": ["David Strassman (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
