The dramatic real story of a Italian princess, born and raised in the comforts of a golden court, who will be forced by war to share the fate of ordinary people in a concentration camp. Mafalda di Savoia was chosen to represent the decline of nobility and the errors of war, which separate and destroy even noble families. Mafalda is a victim of political strategies that overlook her, and her tragic death shows the levelling power of war, that forces poor and rich alike to share the same destiny.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fFVY89pJ4pn9I7dgIxLe44kSxrf.jpg", "actors": ["Stefania Rocca (Mafalda di Savoia)", "Johannes Brandrup (Filippo d'Assia)", "Franco Castellano (II) (Aldo Maggio)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
