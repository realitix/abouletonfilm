Where to go to work? After working as a stand-by in a local recreation-and-entertainment park, he tries himself as a proof-reader in typography, a laboratory assistant in a plant and exhausts all his stock of photos for passes.

A work which brings so much happiness both to him and to other people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/npbnA0GCRiXwkhwZwIx9VmkxOHg.jpg", "actors": ["Aleksei Mokrousov (Sergey)", "Aleksandr Shirvindt (Father)", "Eve Kivi (Mother)", "Yuri Puzyryov (Kirill)", "Mariya Mironova (Olga)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
