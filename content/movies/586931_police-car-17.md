Motor patrolman Tim Conlon (McCoy) and his partner Bumps O'Neill (Ward Bond) vie for the attentions of Helen Regan (Evalyn Knapp), daughter of a fellow cop. Our hero not only wins Helen but also the undying admiration of his fellow lawmen through a series of incredible acts of heroism. All things considered, Police Car 17 is a western in modern dress. All that's missing is the final shootout at High Noon, but this is neatly compensated for by a climactic fistic battle in an abandoned garage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uhooQAPRU5VavYTMiJVTsNbdOsw.jpg", "actors": ["Tim McCoy (Tim Conlon)", "Evalyn Knapp (Helen Regan)", "Edwin Maxwell (Big Bill Standish)", "Ward Bond (Bumps O'Neill)", "DeWitt Jennings (Captain T.
