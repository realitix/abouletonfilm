He and his fellow pirates kidnap the beautiful girl. When singing cat pirates decide to kill all the mice on board for the buried treasure, the natives call to Mighty Mouse for help. Singing his way from the skies, Mighty Mouse flies to the pirate ship, fights buccaneers to the death, and saves the young beauty. He returns her to her people, to their thunderous applause. Lots of opera singing in this one.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gW7CNqC9PKSRXzvDGvSS7MufgKV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
