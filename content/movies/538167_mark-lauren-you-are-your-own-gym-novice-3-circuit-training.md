These workouts are short but highly intense. At the same time, they train strength, endurance and agility and stimulate the burning of fat, which persists very long after the end of training. There are three different difficulty levels (novice, intermediate and advanced) and 3 different training plans, which I describe in the next chapter. So the workout plan is: 3 workouts per week, each workout contains 4 body weight exercises.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jyGD3dX2i2GndNU3GcjQ02VIBie.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
