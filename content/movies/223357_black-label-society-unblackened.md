The concert showcases the band's songs with a greater use of acoustic instruments but without losing any of their power and intensity. Zakk Wylde leads from the front as always, performing here on both guitar and piano and demonstrating the subtler side of his music alongside the blistering solos that his fans know and love. This is definitely a live concert not to be missed!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8vbVj1BBVzvyLjePzuQf3oz95OK.jpg", "actors": ["Zakk Wylde (Vocals, Guitars)", "Nick Catanese (Guitars)", "John DeServio (Bass)", "Derek Sherinian (Piano)", "Chad Szeliga (Drums)", "Greg Locascio (Backing Vocals)", "Black Label Society ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
