Join Michele Alboreto, Stefan Johannson, Niki Lauda, Nigel Mansell,  Nelson Piquet, Alain Prost, Keke Rosberg and Ayrton Senna, to get fascinating insights from the personalities behind the wheel.  The themes are endless and power-packed: Hear about Lauda\u2019s retirement, Nigel Mansell\u2019s first race wins, the emergence of new talents like Senna, the disappointment of mechanical failures, turbo teething problems, and what it\u2019s like to race on some of the most famous circuits in the world - all from the horse\u2019s mouth, so to speak.  The review of the 1985 season has all the main action from every round and the inside story on all the major players, all complemented by their own telling insights on the season as it unfolds.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
