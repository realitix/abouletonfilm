It remained unfinished due to the death of Sergei Parajanov. The Confession (1990) was his favorite screenplay, which was written in the 1960s and was his film-memory of the childhood, student years, marriage, imprisonment and more as the fantasist Parajanov perceived it. Parajanov gifted the screenplay to Mikhail Vartanov, made a drawing on the cover and wrote: \"The Confession will only be made by a director born in 1924 in Tiflis, Georgia.\" He predicted that he would not finish it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pgqAI4ONV3NV5A0cHqv7EwZj9Ju.jpg", "actors": ["Sofiko Chiaureli (Mother)", "Yuri Mgoyan (Relative)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
