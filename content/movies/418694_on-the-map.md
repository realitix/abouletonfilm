Featuring interviews with the Jewish American athletes who made history, \"On the Map\" combines the pulsepounding action of a high-stakes game with an incendiary political situation at the height of the Cold War to deliver a film that honors Israeli heroes, mesmerizes fans of the game and captures the spirit of a nation triumphant and victorious against all odds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/epU87URPoWLoDEF4n07PuHhyVWW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "0xUGknkk-Yc"}
