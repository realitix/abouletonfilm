It wasn't my idea, I was made to do it by that lot what pull all the strings. I went everywhere, up north, down south and I even had to go to Scotland, but you have to do these things you see. If I'd have had my way I wouldn't have gone, I'd have stayed at home with my feet up watching Dragons Den with a box of Magnums, but it wasn't my way..So in the end what happened was, I got to this one place in Digbeth, which is in Birmingham and they've got a load of video cameras there and they say right we're gonna film this and I shrugged my shoulders and said OK. So they did and this is what you've got in your hands, the DVD of it, so have a look at it and see what you think. OK bye, From Angelos", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bP219sb5rVSgfXhp7E7AuIJ5EDq.jpg", "actors": ["Daniel Renton Skinner (Angelos Epithemiou)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
