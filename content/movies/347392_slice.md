And that aspect of _Slice_ totally worked for me. But there was other things that didn't. Things like this playing out more like a couple of back-to-back episodes of a TV show than movie, a TV show we didn't get to watch the first or last episode of. Things like half the actors not being very good at their job. Things like a veritable cornucopia of dropped plot threads. You know, important \"good movie\" stuff.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"}], "recommandations_id": [583046, 461928, 472226, 449535], "youtube_key": "dYt4AeiU-Vc"}
