What can we do to wake up? Catharina Roland explores this crucial question, inviting us to share in her deeply enriching journey to discover how we can be whole again, how we can heal ourselves and the environment we live in, and how we can leave the cocoons of our perception to face our own selfishness and fears.  Through lessons from visionaries and spiritual teachers as well as numerous exercises, Awake in the Dream gives us the tools to break down the walls of the person we have created for ourselves. Complete the transformation from caterpillar to butterfly. Tap into the potential that has existed since the beginning of time, and wake up to the wholeness that awaits each and every one of us.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/spNDkDeC7X66nD74rfJM8qdtaRt.jpg", "actors": ["Catharina Roland (Woman on a journey)", "Barbara Marx Hubbard (Spiritual messenger)", "Tom Kenyon (Sound Healer)", "Eric Pearl (Energetic Healer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "bNmNyEgVZoc"}
