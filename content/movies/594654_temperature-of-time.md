Though this piece starts out with live action filming, the eventual appearance of the \"phenakistoscope\" animation composed with live action images is a true gem. Yamamoto always has been acknowledged for her skill in blowing in \"anima \u2013 spirit\" and boldly tries out a new experiment of blending it in with the live action image. What is awesome is that the huge phenakistoscope that appears in the live action shooting with no composites has power to nullify virtual distance and existence within what is called the image. There, a \"composite-like reality\" emerges.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zgqcyZcfreXc1ROWSOJkrUJC3W7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
