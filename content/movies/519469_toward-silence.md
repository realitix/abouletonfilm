WALLSTREET, the director dived into the universe of the Op\u00e9ra national de Paris to film his documentary about this major centre for musical creation. During this shoot, he met Philippe Jordan, musical director of the Op\u00e9ra national de Paris. \u201cFilming Philippe Jordan is like a waking dream. He occupies the frame, he bursts from the frame, he is simultaneously totally present in the music, and elsewhere, connected to some invisible forces,\u201d says the filmmaker about the conductor, whom he was able to film close up during rehearsals for Gustav Mahler\u2019s Ninth Symphony. This invisible aspect is what the camera explores in this short film: by focusing on this piece in particular, entirely given over to listening and immerged in the very heart of creation, Jean-St\u00e9phane Bron reveals a fragment of work that we imagine to be titanic, and allows us to see and to hear, in a whole new way, a work whose interpretation is profoundly marked by silence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1S7DPqxCnk4lph3rSXaQZtZrxHr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
