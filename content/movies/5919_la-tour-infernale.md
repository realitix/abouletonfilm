Paul Newman plays the architect, Steve McQueen the fire chief, William Holden the wealthy contractor and Richard Chamberlain his arrogant cost-cutting son-in-law.\r\n\r\nThis overblown disaster flick has a great all-star cast and was a huge success at the box office, but it pales in comparison to \u201cThe Poseidon Adventure,\u201d released two years earlier. It lacks the compelling story, the great human interest and iconic score (even though John Williams composed both), plus it\u2019s 48 minutes longer than \u201cPoseidon,\u201d which gives it a tedious vibe; that is, until the engrossing last half hour.\r\n\r\nOn the female front there\u2019s the striking Faye Dunaway, the architect\u2019s babe; Susan Blakely, who looks great in tight slacks; and Susan Flannery, who\u2019s smokin\u2019 in a shirt & panties. Unfortunately, whereas \u201cPoseidon\u201d knocked it out of the ballpark with its women, \u201cTowering\u201d fails to capitalize on its resources.\r\n\r\nThe film\u2019s has its attractions and is still worth seeing if you favor the cast and 70\u2019s disaster flicks. It\u2019s just a letdown considering its streamlined predecessor and potential.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 45 minutes and was shot in San Francisco and Los Angeles. WRITERS: Stirling Silliphant wrote the script based on the books \u201cThe Tower\u201d by Richard Martin Stern and \u201cThe Glass Inferno\u201d by Thomas N. Scortia & Frank M. Robinson. ADDITIONAL CAST NOTABLES: Fred Astaire, Jennifer Jones, O.J. Simpson, Robert Vaughn, Robert Wagner and Mike Lookinland (aka Bobby Brady).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"}], "recommandations_id": [551, 11123, 10671, 5924]}
