Within a colorless city of walls, corridors, and small rooms, a man makes his way from home to work, then to a bar, and then, by a stroke of luck, into an outdoors of space, fresh air, and color. Along the way, he changes his face to fit his surroundings, interacts with his dog, argues with co-workers, and gossips at a bar. His altering of his visage suggests a two-faced nature, and his stepping into the outdoors provides the ultimate test of his real identity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4dg9Jst70AN8T66CkHH9k4Lo6i6.jpg", "actors": ["Phil Nice (Voice)", "Arthur Smith (Voice)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
