If that is the case, they're must be a much different view on the subject from the ghost's perspective. David Harrison was just a regular guy until he tragically was killed during a robbery, but now knows the irritating struggles of roaming the earth as an unseeable spirit. Day in the Life of Death is a documentary style comedic narrative (or mockumentary) taken from the ghost's point of view of roaming the earth after death.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7qbHmNqw8OugbL24MClbHee4RIx.jpg", "actors": ["Kyle Hartford (David Williams)", "Eric Willner (Jared Stone)", "Aidan Mead (Dale (Pencil Neck Guy))", "Timothy Kandra (Frank)", "Maylia Noda (Kayla)", "Wayne Degen (Jeremy)", "Jacob Benton (YouTube Kid)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "kylehartford1999", "content": "A funny, well paced documentary.
