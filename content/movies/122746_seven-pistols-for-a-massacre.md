Typical revenge western with an overlong saloon brawl including showgirls, who add nothing to the movie except filler. Good performance as usual by Fajardo and a great shot of Hill's pistol near the end (similar shot the following year in Hill's \"I Want Him Dead\", a much better spaghetti.) Obvious cuts with about 8 mins. total missing."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "9evzise3Kj0"}
