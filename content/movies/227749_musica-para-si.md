The only company she has is the radio, tuned to a station of popular music hits that the audience can ask for by telephone. There is a single hint that she may have breast cancer. Then, she sets the table for a large dinner - for one - including a champagne bottle. She commits suicide by pills overdose, before she utters a word.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Isabel de Castro (The woman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
