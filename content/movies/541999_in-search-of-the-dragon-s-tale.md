In the process we go on a journey back in time to the Walled City of Kowloon.  Once dubbed the 'sleaziest' place in Hong Kong, it was an island of Chinese sovereignty within the British colony. As a result of a secret political compromise between the Chinese and British Governments the Walled City was destroyed in 1992. This decision resulted in the displacement of the Walled City's 40,000 residents. The documentary gives the story of modern day Hong Kong from a personal viewpoint and shows historical links to a place the authorities preferred to forget.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
