This is the last straw for his loving, but fed up parents, who eventually kick him out of the house. Sitting at a restaurant not knowing where to go, he watches car guards in the parking lot and decides that he will also become a car guard just to stay afloat until the next big stand-up competition, which he firmly believes he can win.
