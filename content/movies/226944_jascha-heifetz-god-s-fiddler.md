Jascha Heifetz was the first truly modern virtuoso, a man about whom Itzhak Perlman said, 'When I spoke with him, I can't believe, I'm talking to God'. Heifetz was a legendary but mysterious figure whose story embodies the dual nature of artistic genius. The paradox of how a mortal man lives with immortal gifts - gifts he must honor, but which extract a life-long price. Is the man and the artist the same person? What is the price each pays? And who was the man behind the music?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7uohAGiyPfB8RQm5XfOZxXJRVhO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
