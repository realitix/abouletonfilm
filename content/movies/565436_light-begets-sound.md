Light Begets Sound is a durational performance focussing on the controlled phasing of both projector and LED lights articulated through custom software and custom built light sensitive instruments. Interrogating aural and optic as well as physiological senses through integrated feedback systems, the performance entices the audience into a state of hallucinogenic perception created through mixing desk input and feedback, and analogue and digital light combinations on a prepared screen.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
