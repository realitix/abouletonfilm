And yet contrary to all expectations our heroine cops out. She refuses to take the university entrance exams is left behind in the country town selling fruit tarts. No one can figure out how come that whiz kid got left behind. Neither can anyone understand why Maraki isn't mad at fate for having wronged her so flagrantly.

She appears to understand something that all the others ignore.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y5FyrwUjq0djHymJqtQcfo97V05.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
