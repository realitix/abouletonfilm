Law enforcement agents can not deal independently with the investigation of this case. News of these acts quickly spread across the country - the arrival of the royal family in Moscow is in danger. It was then that a detective investigator Erast Petrovich Fandorin, who achieved certain professional successes in his business at such a young age, takes over the investigation. The provincial secretary of Aniasiy Tulips, for whom this business is a chance to prove himself in a favorable light, is taken to help Erast. The detectives are born an incredible and seemingly incredible version - Jack the Ripper visited Moscow, as bloody kisses were found on the girls' necks. The Ripper is also a personal threat to Fandorin, as the maniac is approaching his lover", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Danila Kozlovsky (Erast Fandorin)", "Elizaveta Boyarskaya ()", "Viktor Verzhbitskiy ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
