With limited speech, Tracy Thresher, 42, and Larry Bissonnette, 52, both faced lives of mute isolation in mental institutions or adult disability centers. When they learned as adults to communicate by typing, their lives changed dramatically. Their world tour message is that the same possibility exists for others like themselves. At each stop, they dissect public attitudes about autism and issue a hopeful challenge to reconsider competency and the future. Along the way, they reunite with old friends from the USA, expand the isolated world of a talented young painter and make new allies in their cause.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k9iaiQbY3cG9TRcaLcQ8rdQWHMh.jpg", "actors": ["Larry Bissonnette (Himself)", "Tracy Thresher (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "mYJ-xlvUvz4"}
