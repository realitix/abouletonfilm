Mehta has mellowed a bit in that time, and the program seems to reflect that.  The orchestra plays with its usual style and finesse, though the fireworks are kept to a minimum. There's a lot of beautiful legato playing to be had here, which is enjoyable to hear when so many ensembles feel the need to punch and pull at music these days. In a word, \"tradition\" is on display, and that's a good thing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iD1StSKmF7X4m2Yye5r9u7oKnGG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
