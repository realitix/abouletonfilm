During their stay, the film uses an extensive flashback structure to reveal the various criminal acts that each have perpetrated. The man leading the seance (Luciano Pigozzi, the \"Italian Peter Lorre\") seems intent on holding them responsible for their various crimes, and his seemingly supernatural knowledge of their past gradually cracks the facade of each one. A classic Italian Gothic from Antonio Margheriti. German/Italian co-production, 'old dark house' style.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3zs2AdAq7N2zd9hztmKVPZYYatB.jpg", "actors": ["Joachim Fuchsberger (Ben Taylor)", "Marianne Koch (Vivian Taylor)", "Helga Anders (Elisabeth)", "Claudio Camaso (Alfred Sinclair)", "Dominique Boschero (Margarete)", "Luciano Pigozzi (Uriat)", "Marianne Leibl (Uriat's Mother)", "Giuliano Raffaelli (Archibald Barrett)", "Marco Morelli (Richard Wright)", "Gudrun Schmidt (Diana)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
