Franz, a journalist, maintains relationships with four women. His three mistresses are introduced with television dreams of intense emotional violence (in the first dream, a mother shouts at her daughter, explaining that as a girl, she does not deserve a room of her own), and the fourth is his wife. He is desperate to have each to himself. Franz never offers a substantial sign of love, but is willing to say anything and make any promise for affection. His dependence on women for fulfilment is explained through arguments with his wife. He claims \"I am my own sound. The women produce voices within me.\" An understandable and sometimes sympathetic antagonist is one of the films greatest strengths. The emotional damage he causes becomes believable.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sunVk0OKgukfyNuSJJaL9171FII.jpg", "actors": ["Elly Naschold ()", "Lukas Resetarits ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
