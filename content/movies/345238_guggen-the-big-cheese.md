He hates the sewers and loves the fresh air on the roof, where he has emigrated. His mom is worried. What will become of this fresh-air-loving, guitar playing son of hers? She forces her husband, Roger Rotten to take Guggen on a father-and-son trip down the sewers to hunt for cheese. On their adventure they must conquer sewercats, gigantic spiders and alligators.
