A confident woman, she first countered racist resentments and remarks with irony and wit. Jokingly, she even referred to herself as a \"K\u00fcmmelt\u00fcrkin\", a derogatory German term for Turkish migrants. Yet after fourteen humiliating years, her fighting spirit has given way to resignation: Melek Tez is returning to Turkey. Blending documentary, interviews and re-enacted scenes, director Jeanine Meerapfel chronicles Melek Tez' life experience.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x8OmeTSOdRgMbUVCQOWl9esrKPv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
