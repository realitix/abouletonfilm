Composed of community-generated performances, re-enactments and extemporaneous recordings, this film functions doubly as an examination of a rapidly changing material culture in the present and as a historical document for the future. Whether the resultant record is directed towards its subjects, its temporary residents (filmmakers), or its Western viewers is a question proposed via the combination of long takes, materialist approaches, selective subtitling, and a focus on various forms of cultural labor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pJIKhO9QjnBYPJcq8dcQjXAtq3J.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
