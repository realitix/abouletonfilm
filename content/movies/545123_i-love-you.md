Both Iimuras play individually as well as a unit. In \u201cDouble Portrait\u201d they are never together, but one by one in three points of view, front, side, and back, assigned to the words \u201cI\u201d, \u201cYou\u201d and \u201cHe/She\u201d respectively. The pronouns rotate with every repetition, for instance, in front view with \u201cYou\u201d, then \u201cHe/She\u201d and back to \u201cI\u201d. Often the words are destroyed acoustically making them unintelligible. \u201cI Love You\u201d is not a style of confession, but the words, and a linguistic practice using a sentence and shifting the pronouns.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jqh6k6CyPp3SWDjrf0l5TG6MV6R.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
