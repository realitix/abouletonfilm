It is a unique and invaluable historical document\u2014a jewel not to be missed\u2014that offers us a different, more intimate and personal, perspective on the life of Ernesto Che Guevara than other films about him that have emerged recently. Presenting brilliantly edited archival material, including private documents and intimate recordings that have never been made available to the public before (including recordings of Che reading poems by Vallejo and Neruda to his wife, intimate family gatherings on 8mm, a speech given by Che in French), Bauer allows us to see the iconic figure as a hero but also as the larger-than-life passionate and idealistic human being that he was.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/43q2qC2F3y08Ajr4iCn76JxNMwZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
