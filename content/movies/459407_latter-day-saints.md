They discuss matters of faith, family, demureness, religion and being. Their quest is personal, it is about proving themselves, an initiation that lasts for the two-year period they spend away from home. The Elders and the Sisters, young Mormon missionaries, leave their country, study a different language and culture and become immersed in a spirit of mission. They aspire to be role models for the perfect boys and girls.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kxkqtDN7hEcRqIteHub0XnzE2vE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
