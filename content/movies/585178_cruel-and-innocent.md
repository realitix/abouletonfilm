In order to avoid dealing with other competitive players of the same kind, he settled a deal for himself to do time at a low security detention facility. He can still be in charge of his deal from prison with the help of his wife Rada. Yet, he bets and loses Rada to another prisoner at a game, which gives that man the right to spend a night with her, as well as to join the elite of players he is part of. Rada has feelings for Ponko's cousin but when she brings some money she has won at a game to him, she learns that he made a deal with Ponko to take care of her while he is in prison. She tries to get out of the vicious circle of crime but fails to do so. The corrupt world of blurred concepts of good and evil has engulfed them all and turned them into predators and victims of its poison.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j5dnkb6r1qlhYrSZPaki9rniCpJ.jpg", "actors": ["Lilyana Varbanova ()", "Bogdan Glishev ()", "Ivan Savov ()", "Alexander Doynov ()", "Peter Krastev ()", "Valya Bankova ()", "Kunka Baeva ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
