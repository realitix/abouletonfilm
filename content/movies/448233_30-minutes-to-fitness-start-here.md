The first program begins with a varied mix of athletic-style cardio favorites (always offering a \u201cbase\u201d move if you get tired or distracted). That's followed by an aero/tone segment that builds muscle as it burns fat. The toning workout features alternating sets of proven body-sculpting classics (e.g. curls, lunges, push-ups). It starts with standing routines and ends with floorwork.
