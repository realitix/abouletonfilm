They finally said, \u201cOK, OK, you can come. But only as tourists.\u201d At the airport, the North Korean consulate brought us to a restaurant and these women came out and started singing North Korean nationalist songs. We were thinking, \u201cLook, we were just on a plane for 20 hours.

If you don\u2019t act excited then you\u2019re not going to get your visa. So we got drunk and jumped up onstage and sang songs with the girls. The next day we got our visas. A lot of people we had gone with didn\u2019t get theirs. That was our first hint at just what a freaky, freaky trip we were embarking on\u2026", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/56WjIbZWztl6CziYjXgXK1a7TIM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
