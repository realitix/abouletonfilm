During World War II, just off Chicago\u2019s shoreline, the US Navy trained over 15,000 carrier pilots on two makeshift \u201cflattops,\u201d both former, coal-fired, side wheel passenger steamers.  Not every pilot landed successfully on the pitching decks of the USS Wolverine and USS Sable and many aircraft went to the Lake bottom.
