Only 10 people managed to escape. Faraj climbed out from amongst the dead and was taken to the USA by 'Human Rights Watch'. Realizing that few people were aware of the genocidal 'Anfal' massacres, Faraj formed the 'Iraqi Mass Graves Survivors' group. He returned to Kurdistan where, with four other survivors, he bought 1001 red apples and cloves and distributed them to families who had lost members. These apples and cloves became symbols of reconciliation and peace.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/glQzVE9dxwJztOWb3Uj7fk6LxpO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
