After years of severe failure, Dr. Docatto is about to throw in the towel all together, when he comes up with an idea so wild, so nutty, and so hair-brained, that he is sure it will secure his place in the history books!  The theory: Cats always land on their feet, so if one were to take two cats, and attach them together, back-to-back, one cat wouldn't be able to do so, thus, the cats would fly, and he would have invented the worlds first Anti-Gravity Propulsion machine!  He attaches two cats together but doesn't bother testing the theory before inviting, colleagues, the media, and the citizens of Jamestown to witness the unveiling!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
