Once Marquard gets a prize of a considerable sum of money, his artistic creativity wanes. While Mary works in a series of paintings, Marquard visits his friend Gregor, a horse breeder and philosopher, sleeps with Angie and visits repeatedly her daughter Lucia. Marquard and Lucia, who have begun a tender and compassionate father-daughter relationship, spend two days in a seaside hotel, deciding not to speak in words. The feelings and communication emerge from a very special way. Mary, who does not know the whereabouts and the reason of the absence of Marquard, realizes it by herself: their love is over. Then, she abruptly interrupts her work so far and starts a new painting entitled \"The visible and invisible.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7UyTJ4nhuU5xioga2VTmIWoW8yp.jpg", "actors": ["Hannelore Elsner (Maria D\u00f6bereiner)", "Guntram Brattia (Marquard von Polheim)", "Rufus Beck (Leo Barnstein)", "Hansa Czypionka (Gregor)", "Michael Dorn (Wachschutzbeamter)", "Oliver Elias (Pedro)", "Henk G\u00f6bel (Hotelier)", "Christine Knispel (Kellnerin)", "Anna Kubin (Lucia)", "Anne Lebinsky (Elenore)", "Stefanie Ro\u00dfe (Angela \u201eAngie\u201c Angler)", "Rebecca Rudolph (Sonja)", "Michael Scherff (Portier)", "Cornelius Schwalm (Polizeibeanter)", "Johanna-Julia Spitzer (Frau im Publikum)", "Katia Tchemberdji (Katharina Simonesco)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "DJePPpJkl7k"}
