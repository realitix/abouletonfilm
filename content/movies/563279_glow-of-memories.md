The film unravels his memories using archival photographs and Shammout\u2019s own paintings to tell the story of Palestinian experience and resistance.  By simply using a montage of visuals and sounds and avoiding narration, Shammout adopts a style that was used by early Soviet filmmakers who wished to communicate across language boundaries, creating a film that offered an non-verbal narrative of the Palestinian cause. The film was screened at a variety of festivals in the former Soviet Union and won a prize at the International Leipzig Documentary and Short Film Week for Cinema and Television in 1973. Recently restored and digitized.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a7baYLLdrCUUVDOj2cta522RHgw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
