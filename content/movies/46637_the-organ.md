A young Polish deserter and gifted organist finds shelter from the fascists in a Slovak Franciscan monastery. He gets into a conflict with the local organist and choir leader, a man limited in his world views and spiritual values. The collision of talent and beauty with pettiness and closed-mindedness leads to envy and ill will, which draw young Felix away from his temporary hiding place and back to the dangers of war.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cehjTnzQfFICO0mkbjB32h8vF8Z.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
