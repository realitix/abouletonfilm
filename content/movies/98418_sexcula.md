Shot in Vancouver, British Columbia, it was screened once before disappearing and sought after by cult aficionados for decades. Now, Impulse Pictures is proud to bring you the world premiere of SEXCULA.  Sex film fans can finally get a look at this elusive crazy Canadian erotic/horror hybrid for the first time ever. Starring a Marilyn Chambers lookalike in dual roles as Countess Sexcula, a buxom cutie with no qualms about lying nude on a table for the entire movie, and a horny bride who can\u2019t wait for her ring.  The nudity and sex are delivered nonstop in this campy horror romp. Watch in amazement at the naked picnic, the \u201cgirl-on-gorilla\u201d strip tease, and stare in awe as a female pleasure-robot puts the plot into a time warp!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AddSjkqthlHAp0TkZN21f4xHwml.jpg", "actors": ["Debbie Collins (Countess Sexcula / Picnic Woman / Woman in Field #2)", "Jamie Orlando (Dr. Fallatingstein / Woman in Carriage / Woman in Field #1)", "John Alexander (Frank)", "Tim Lowery (Orgie)", "Bud Coal (Gorilla / Lumberjack)", "Marie McLeod (Benchtest / Hooker)", "David F.
