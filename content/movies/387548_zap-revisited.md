What started as an off-beat idea for a party ended with National Guard troops expelling the revelers from Zap and the nearby towns of Beulah and Hazen, creating a national media sensation.  Zap Revisited, a film by West Fargo native Christ Breitling, recalls the strange-but-true story of the \"Zip to Zap\", aka the \"Zap-In\", through the memories of people who were there and took part in this uniquely infamous episode in North Dakota history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w1DgrIugFRvjkKwtEEBz0hIEUC3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "p7LjNcwqqCQ"}
