It would appear that together these filmmakers go by the name of P.S.Y.C.H.O. Productions (you can't help but notice that half the cast is wearing that company's t-shirt). I wouldn't have thought that a low budget comedy about cannibals that runs close to 120 minutes would be something I'd enjoy, but it turns out I was very wrong.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qhQd19pxrSHFVk98UzZi566CSYK.jpg", "actors": ["Jim Aal (Markus)", "Bemo B.
