On separate channels, the viewer sees Acconci and Kathy Dillon sitting alone in wooden boxes in different rooms, each facing a static camera. Although they can only see and hear each other on separate monitors, they attempt to interact and respond to one another directly, as if their communication were unmediated. Through language and gesture, Acconci tries to manipulate Dillon's actions from his box, as though by remote control.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Vito Acconci (Himself)", "Kathy Dillon (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
