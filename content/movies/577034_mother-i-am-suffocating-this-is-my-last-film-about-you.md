She is followed by sellers, beggars and passersby, outraged voices, pity and curious glances. Parallel to her, among a herd of sheep, a lamb toddles its way from the far away mountains into the heart of the city, only to find itself dangling, skinned and headless, on a butcher\u2019s shoulder. In the meantime, under the scorching sun, in a roofless house, a woman is persistently knitting a garment, unwinding a thread coiled over her son\u2019s face. \u2018Mother, I Am Suffocating. This is My Last Film About You\u2019 is a symbolic social-political voyage of a society, spiralling between religion, identity and collective memory. \u201cI saw in you what they saw, mother. You deserve your war\u201d.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gLzhfHM4ao65BtzwpYm2ciuit2T.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
