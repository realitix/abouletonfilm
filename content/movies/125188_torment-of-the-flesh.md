It concerns a man who kills women because, as his lawyer says, he was not loved by his mother and in his puberty he was dismissed by girls as sexually unattractive; in short: it all broke the poor man's heart. And when ever he meets too inviting women now, showing their attractions, well, you see, it is the urge then, he just cannot control himself; it is, as the title says, the torment of the flesh.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/80vhREHz7h68AENBtPkp8ohGial.jpg", "actors": ["Herbert Fux (Alexander Jablonsky)", "Hermann Laforet (Vorsitzender)", "Hanns Obonya (Verteidiger)", "Peter Janisch (Staatsanwalt)", "Josef Loibl (Kriminalkommissar)", "Thomas H\u00f6rbiger (Kriminalassistent)", "Hans Baldauf (Barbesitzer Joe)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
