He is stricken with overpowering tiredness, everything is too difficult, the world an insurmountable obstacle course. The young man is suffering from a syndrome that used to be called neurasthenia and is today known as burn-out. He can't sleep, has neither strength nor courage and spends the night in his car. Life parked in a dead-end. Visually stunning and with an almost documentary feel, the film shows the man's life as a parable for the young generation in Iran.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2M9yxUfwlEmq9Ib7Co74GZrCpg6.jpg", "actors": ["Omid Tootoonchi (Director)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
