{"tmdb_id": 373949, "title": "Kr\u00f3l Roger", "original_title": "Kr\u00f3l Roger", "slug_title": "krol-roger", "date": "2015-05-01", "genre": ["Musique"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "The story concerns the enlightenment of the Christian King Roger II by a young shepherd who represents pagan ideals.  Kasper Holten\u2019s production (The Royal Opera\u2019s first) of Kr\u00f3l Roger (King Roger) brought the opera back to the London stage after an absence of almost 40 years. Karol Szymanowski\u2019s masterpiece powerfully presents the dilemmas of culture versus nature and man versus beast, and movingly depicts King Roger\u2019s inner struggles as he moves from an impossible life of repressed desires to the other extreme, giving in to his own demons. Meanwhile, Roger\u2019s people, seduced by the promises of the mysterious Shepherd, are drawn towards totalitarianism and repression. Antonio Pappano conducts Szymanowksi\u2019s opulent and beautiful score, with a cast including Mariusz Kwiecie\u0144 as Roger (one of the greatest interpreters of the role today), Saimir Pirgu as the Shepherd, and Georgia Jarman in her Royal Opera debut as Roger\u2019s loving queen Roxana.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qBeuvKTVkMzEEKwyEmJ95lA8ph3.jpg", "actors": ["Antonio Pappano ()", "Mariusz Kwiecien ()", "Georgia Jarman ()", "Saimir Pirgu ()", "Kim Begley ()", "Alan Ewing ()", "Agnes Zwierko ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
