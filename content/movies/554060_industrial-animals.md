Weighing in at roughly 61 minutes, this low budget, found footage film from the UK features a cast of just three people who also cover many of the behind the scenes credits as well. In fact, the entire story takes place over a three-day span, mostly in one simple setting. But while all of the factors add up to a \u201csmall\u201d film, when all is said and done, Industrial Animals ends up packing a fairly strong and somewhat unexpected punch.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6i45g8HtqCzuulbHO3xL4ku2tpi.jpg", "actors": ["Thomas Davenport ()", "Tamsin Howland ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
