His wife Nelle, who sometimes abuses drugs, spoils his ingrate teenage stepdaughter Sandy, who is kind only to her sweet, mentally handicapped brother, Jimmy Vandevyver. After a class on sexual abuse from feminist teacher Lydia De Beule, Sandy pretends Rob abused her. Lydia, Rob's ex, eagerly helps her fabricate 'proof', which a female police commissioner eagerly believes. A frustrated judge (and father) shamelessly ignores the legal benefit of the doubt, even tricks Rob while in jail. Nelle discovers more then one sick truth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4lGwUTI5NO48oVvKyWPPCXCPHCq.jpg", "actors": ["Eugene Bervoets ()", "Karlijn Sileghem ()", "Elias Mentzel ()", "Ellen ten Damme ()", "Zo\u00eb De Roovere ()", "Joke Devynck ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
