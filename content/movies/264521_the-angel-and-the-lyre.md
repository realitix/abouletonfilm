Vera wants to celebrate with friends, while Achim wants to go off to a lonely mountain hut. And so, he goes off alone into the mountains. In the hut, he meets the student Susanne, with whom he spends New Years' Eve; gets to know well; and falls in love with. Unfortunately, through misfortune, they lose sight of each other afterwards. They didn't even bother to exchange names and addresses! And so, with Craigslist not yet in existence, it seems very unlikely they'll ever see one another again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pFDQ1Dp3G6tO55tUmhFnI2s156c.jpg", "actors": ["Hertha Feiler (Susanne Maria Henrici)", "Hans S\u00f6hnker (Achim Strengholt)", "Hans Nielsen (Bernhard Zoller)", "Lina Carstens (Maria Theresia, seine Schwester)", "Erich Ponto (Barnabas, Diener bei Strengholt)", "Susanne von Almassy (Vera Schellhorn)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
