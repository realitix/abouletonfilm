The only way he can figure to do this is to inform on the group to the authorities in as harmless a manner as possible. Unfortunately, these betrayals cause the group to lose many men, and the traitor grows fearful of the authorities. He gives officials every scrap of information he has in return for a full pardon, and he returns home. His wife, when she hears of these events, is infuriated. Such betrayal is far in excess of anything she can condone, and she kills him. ~ Clarke Fountain, Rovi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7NwS1hpHiQDb3wQWC0Fq3iC1dNq.jpg", "actors": ["Mari Kiss (Kat\u00f3, Soromfain\u00e9)", "J\u00e1nos Derzsi (Gelencs\u00e9r J\u00f3ska)", "Gy\u00f6rgy D\u00f6rner (Soromfai J\u00f3zsef)", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szab\u00f3 (\u00cdrnok)", "\u0110oko Rosi\u0107 (Hegyessy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
