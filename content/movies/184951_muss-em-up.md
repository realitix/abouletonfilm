Paul admits his dog was shot by extortionists to show they mean business, and shows Tip some threatening notes they sent. That night, Paul's ward, Corinne, is kidnapped by two gangsters and her driver is found dead the next morning. The kidnappers contact Tip demanding $200,000, which is delivered according to instructions. Awaiting the return of Corrine, Tip learns her fianc\u00e9, Gene Leland, is an ex-convict, and he also investigates why a thug, Maratti, was found prowling around the grounds, and why Paul's brother-in-law, Jim Glenray, was seen leaving the estate late the night before. And when the chauffeur is murdered with Amy's gun as he was about to confess some complicity, Tip has to piece together various clues to pinpoint the culprits.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vffotKKcz57a4RJpjxAvYQ3CQfK.jpg", "actors": ["Preston Foster (Tip O'Neil)", "Alan Mowbray (Paul Harding)", "Ralph Morgan (Jim Glenray)", "John Carroll (Gene Leland)", "Molly Lamont (Nancy Harding)", "Ward Bond (John Doe, a Gangster)", "Maxine Jennings (Cleo)", "Robert Middlemass (Inspector Brock)", "Margaret Callahan (Amy Hutchins)", "Clarence Muse (William)", "Florine McKinney (Corinne)", "Lucille Ball (Departing Train Passenger (uncredited))", "Noel Madison (Tony Spivali, Gambler)", "Harold Huber (Maratti)", "Paul Porcasi (Luigi Turseniani, Head of the Mob)", "John Adair (John Doe, Jr.-a Gangster)", "Florence Lake (Tony's Girlfriend)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
