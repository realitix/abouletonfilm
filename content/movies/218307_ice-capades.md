The many subplots center around a performance of the real-life Ice-Capades skating troupe, featuring such luminaries as Belita, Red McCarthy, Megan Taylor, and future Republic film queen Vera Hruba Ralston. James Ellison plays the nominal leading character, a hotshot newsreel cameraman named Bob Clemens. Assigned to film an international skating star in action, Clemens inadvertently wastes miles of celluloid on aspiring skater Marie (Dorothy Lewis) rather than the real star, the unphotogenic Karen Vajda (Rene Riano). But not to worry: With the help of slick showbiz promoter Larry Herman (Phil Silvers), Marie becomes an Ice-Capades headliner in her own right. In addition to Silvers, the comedy relief in Ice-Capades is in the capable hands of Vera Vague (Barbara Jo Allen), Jerry Colonna and Gus Schilling.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tWGaHrh4y44Igmux2zat97o7BMV.jpg", "actors": ["James Ellison (Bob Clemens)", "Jerry Colonna (Colonna)", "Dorothy Lewis (Marie Bergin aka Anderson)", "Barbara Jo Allen (Vera Vague)", "Phil Taylor (Ice-Capades Skater)", "Alan Mowbray (Pete Ellis)", "Phil Silvers (Larry Herman)", "Gus Schilling (Dave)", "Tim Ryan (Jackson)", "Harry Clark (Reed)", "Renie Riano (Karen Vadja)", "Carol Adams (Helen)", "Lois Dworshak (Ice-Capades Skater)", "Megan Taylor (Ice-Capades Skater)", "Vera Ralston (Ice-Capades Skater)", "Red McCarthy (Ice-Capades Skater)", "Joe Jackson Jr. (Tramp Bicycle Act, Ice Capades)", "Al Surette (The Straw Man, Ice-Skating Comedian)", "Serge Flash (Ice-Skating Juggler)", "Jack Heasley (Twins Skating Act)", "Robert Heasley (Twins Skating Act)", "Rod Bacon (Audition Sign-Up Man)", "Belita (Ice Capades Skater)", "Sally Cairns (Audition Girl)", "Lois Collier (Audition Girl)", "Billy Curtis (George)", "George Davis (Waiter)", "Harry Depp (Reporter)", "Edward Gargan (Joe, the Bouncer)", "Robert Haines (Reporter)", "Marilyn Hare (Audition Girl)", "Howard C.
