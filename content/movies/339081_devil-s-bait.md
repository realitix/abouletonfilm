When one bakery pan and one loaf of bread become accidentally poisoned, a hunt for that loaf ensues.  The story is engaging, if somewhat predictable. The telling of it mixes humor, gentility and genuine fear somewhat uneasily. I find that this kind of mixture detracts from the overall impact. I prefer a tighter and more monochrome focus. This mixture, however, seems to crop up in a good number of British pictures and be a generic aspect of them.  The most memorable moments are those depicting a terrified blonde who realizes that the bread is poisoned and races to warn her companion, discovering poisoned geese along the way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4vVi0F4XrlLgHx8SQy7or1y9Ud9.jpg", "actors": ["Geoffrey Keen (Joe Frisby)", "Jane Hylton (Ellen Frisby)", "Gordon Jackson (Sergeant Malcolm)", "Dermot Kelly (Mr. Alfred Love)", "Shirley Lawrence (Shirley Gordon)", "Eileen Moore (Barbara Farrell)", "Molly Urquhart (Mrs. Tanner)", "Rupert Davies (Landlord)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
