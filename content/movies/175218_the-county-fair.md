While she's dead set against it, the niece is a sweet thing and would do anything to help her aunt--even marry the rich jerk. However, a possible way out is presented. When a poor young man is taken in and fed, he turns out (naturally) to be a jockey and thinks he can win the $3000 prize at the fair and save the farm.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jUG6oa2fGsh40DVElVj7RYwDE9Q.jpg", "actors": ["Helen Jerome Eddy (Sally Greenway)", "David Butler (Joel Bartlett)", "William V.
