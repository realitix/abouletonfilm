G\u00f6ran is not altogether in harmony with himself or his work situation and is trying a little bit too hard to please everyone around him. Unlike his best friend however, he is not prepared to compromise with love and settle for the less than perfect girl. In pursuit of love he sails out to a Midsummer party in the seductive Swedish archipelago. Unexpected love lurks in the bright Swedish summer's night ready to rock the raft of romance. Comedy and romance are the main ingredients when a story unfolds about young urban self conscious people in a high society setting.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aSFF0Qs9PKOQ5CfLylJgihcrgK4.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Magnusson (G\u00f6ran)", "David Hellenius (Alex)", "Mirja Turestedt (Grynet)", "Moa Gammel (Linnea)", "Alexandra Rapaport (Sofia)", "Peter Dalle (Hans Kj\u00e4ll\u00e9n)", "Christine Meltzer (Elin)", "Tanja Lorentzon (Anne)", "Dan Ekborg (Greger Bengtzon)", "Ruth Vega Fernandez (Mikaela)", "Niklas Engdahl (Dodde)", "Carl Anders Stjernl\u00f6f (Niklas)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [187628, 49874, 93222, 33494], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
