He drinks some of their mysterious brew and passes out. When he wakes up under a tree he is astonished to find that 20 years have passed and things are a lot different. This is a charming story about how America changed due to the Revolutionary War, only in a different and more subtle way than ever told before.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b8zCjTssnTJSPSOg1GJuzxzqQtm.jpg", "actors": ["Joseph Jefferson (Rip van Winkle)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [196598, 139873, 190641, 159905], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
