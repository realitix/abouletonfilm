There's hot Japanese track action, the requisite visits to the tuning houses, and we watch Ketzal and some crazy import hardcases hit 300kph! This time round we modify a $3000 car that we found in a garage and race it against an Aston Martin DB7, an M3 and a host of GTRs! Along with our Battle Day and the madness that is High Octane.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lf5iFhDMf6dVh83IxOHof7uAIJ7.jpg", "actors": ["Ketzal Sterling ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
