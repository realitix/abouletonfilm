Beethoven thought she was a bad influence on the boy. Sadly, the nephew isn't receptive to Beethoven's \"overtures\", and resents his boorish uncle's efforts on his behalf. The nephew is a complete nonentity, lacking in both interest and talent. He seems to wish only to be left alone.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y7hMMt7pFLYF8awISfAHxdtAy1y.jpg", "actors": ["Wolfgang Reichmann (Ludwig van Beethoven)", "Dietmar Prinz (Karl)", "Jane Birkin (Johanna)", "Nathalie Baye (Leonore)", "Mathieu Carri\u00e8re (Archduke Rodolphe)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
