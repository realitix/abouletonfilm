The 34 minute long film is fast paced and shows different types of dances at several key locations in Belgrade, Serbia. The performances are cut by the interviews with the artists and athletes, addressing the viewer, who talk about their beginnings and the road to success. The third segment of the film are young people, transitioning into adulthood, who talk about what their own dreams are. The idea that the film \"Fulfill your dream!\" carries is to show young people, through the movie itself, through the testimonies of successful artists and athletes, and finally through the example of the author, that it is possible to start an independent career, thanks to their creativity, ambition and perseverance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kPtIzYL3wN1UR7vXfEauPKfegiS.jpg", "actors": ["Ivan Bosilj\u010di\u0107 (Himself)", "Bo\u0161ko \u0106irkovi\u0107 (Himself)", "Katarina Devi\u0107 (Herself)", "Fe\u0111a Dimovi\u0107 (Himself)", "Vlade Divac (Himself)", "Zvezdan Gavrilovi\u0107 (Himself)", "Nikola Jani\u0107evi\u0107 (Himself)", "Pavle Kne\u017eevi\u0107 (Himself)", "Dunja Lazi\u0107 (Herself)", "Vlada Markovi\u0107 (Himself)", "Nevena Mili\u0107evi\u0107 (Herself)", "Milica Mil\u0161a (Herself)", "Stefan Naerac (Himself)", "Milena Popovi\u0107 (Herself)", "Tatjana Pu\u0161kar (Herself)", "Vladimir Radivojevi\u0107 (Himself)", "Tijana \u0160i\u0161ovi\u0107 (Herself)", "Ana Tadi\u0107 (Herself)", "Johnny Tarzan (Himself)", "Sergej Trifunovi\u0107 (Himself)", "Andrea Vukoj\u010di\u0107 (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
