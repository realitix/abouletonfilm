Through the words of the master architect Eero Saarinen, and the ambient chorus of mallets beating metal sheets into graceful curves, the film reveals the innovative structural techniques and the brilliant design of this avant-garde monument, presenting one of this century's greatest civil engineering achievements as a metaphor for the struggle to win the West. This film went on to be nominated for an Academy Award\u00ae for Best Documentary Short in 1967.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eHYnGIxk73IZJyUkQ4gV13eHRNq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
