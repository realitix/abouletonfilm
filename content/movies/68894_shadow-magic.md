Liu's work with Wallace brings him conflict with tradition and his father's authority, complicated by his falling in love with Ling, daughter of Lord Tan, star of Beijing's traditional opera. Liu sees movies as his chance to become wealthy and worthy of Ling. When the Shadow Magic pair are invited to show the films to the Empress Dowager, things look good. But, is disaster in the script? And, can movies preserve tradition even as they bring change?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eHbA0xV9grPrEya8332oTVY1viB.jpg", "actors": ["Jared Harris (Raymond Wallace)", "Xia Yu (Liu Jinglun (Liu Zhonglun))", "Yufei Xing (Ling)", "Liu Peiqi (Master Ren (Ren JingFeng))", "L\u00fc Liping (Madame Ren)", "Jingming Wang (Old Liu)", "Yusheng Li (Lord Tan (Tan Xinpei))", "Yukui Zhang (Lao Chang)", "Chuang Cheng (Mi Hu)", "Zhongwei Zheng (Fu Guan)", "Qi Mu (Jewelry Tower)", "Bin Li (Empress Ci Xi)", "Fang Qing-Zhuo (Widow Jiang)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
