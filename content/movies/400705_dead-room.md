An otherwise ordinary flat in London, owned by its lively but untrustworthy Nigerian Landlord, No. 2 is a room that was born bad. It attracts the wrong people, and something weird always happens there. A young and sensitive writer goaded beyond endurance by an old enemy, an actress who is the victim of a crazed, bomb-making Stalker, a late night seance which goes gruesomely wrong, and a dangerously insane assassin on a gleeful killing spree. Four examples of just how macabre and downright odd Room No. 2's history is.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dFSGerlw5pE2C6Szqc21X8NWlvO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
