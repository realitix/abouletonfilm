Within the Soviet system, a colorful crowd of artists, musicians, freaks, vagabonds and other long-haired drop-outs created their own system, which connected those who believed in peace, love, and freedom for their bodies and souls.  More than 40 years later, a group of eccentric hippies from Estonia take a road trip to Moscow where the hippies still gather annually on the 1st of June for celebration that is related to the tragic event in 1971, when thousands of Soviet hippies were arrested by the KGB. The journey through time and dimensions goes deep into the psychedelic underground world in which these people strived for freedom.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oQgrdNCA7RkmLPWGaT8asfVq9bC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ZKRgZiyQvZU"}
