He dresses himself neatly, he sweats perfume, he respects the female species in a way that he refuses to see them as sex objects, and he lives with his grandmother. People around him deem him gay. Gina, on the other hand, looks like the typical bimbo, whose appeal lies mainly on the bulk between her shoulders and waist. Her reputation among men precedes anything she may have to prove about herself. Both knew that the other exists, but not worth pursuing amid piles of work and not to mention their unfavorable first impressions of each other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oVeW8Wn3OnIdJhFUFCmfSPXKc35.jpg", "actors": ["Aga Muhlach (Popoy)", "Joyce Jimenez (Gina)", "Gloria Romero (Lola Meding)", "Tessie Tomas (Miren)", "Mandy Ochoa (Alvin)", "John Prats (Bong)", "Julia Clarete (Cathy)", "Don Laurel (Egay)", "Bernard Palanca (Steven)", "Don Escudero (Vince)", "Jay Espa\u00f1o (Marlon)", "Dick Israel (Hector)", "Gabe Mercado (Dennis)", "Joy Ortega (Doris)", "Carlo Mu\u00f1oz (Kit)", "Ogie Diaz (Nestor)", "Andrea Del Rosario (Karen)", "Ricky Rivero (Chad)", "Baba Pharma (Carla)", "Maritina Romulo (Sandy)", "Mel Kimura (Shirley)", "Ian Galliguez (Noemi)", "Madeleine Nicolas (Wilma)", "Kimberly Diaz (Evelyn)", "Alvin Aguilar (Dodie)", "Georgina Sandico (Jessica)", "Jessette Prospero (Alice)", "Wamachill Guangco (Baby)", "C.J.
