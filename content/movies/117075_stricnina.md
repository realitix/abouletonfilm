Now everything is sweetness, what continues is death: the voyage into death \u2013 the transfiguration \u2013 the images that return, only to disappear from memory, emerge from the recollections in a purifying vortex that take them back to their essence. It\u2019s the gradual breaking down of the image into form and then into colours and then into light and finally it\u2019s the beginning: the vibration that is the matrix of sound of light of life. It\u2019s the cosmos that makes that meat good to eat for a million years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/70ENrzn4mf5nit8L6g7gEh9JQZj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
