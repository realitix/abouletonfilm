Her newly hired driver is Christy Hollis, a woman who has no problem seducing a traffic cop to take her from behind, only to get a ticket anyway. Molly's other driver is Casey, Christy's occasional lover, who likes to seduce Molly's racing mechanic. Molly's previous driver, the mechanic's sister, died after rival sponsor Orson McKnight of McKnight Tires sent his helper Dutch to tamper with her car. While Molly and Casey fool around in Molly's shower, the mechanic's foiling of another car tampering gets him sent to the hospital.
