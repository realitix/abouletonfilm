I knew about the precarious conditions for those whose lives depend on the manual cutting of sugar cane, but what I wanted to film from this world was the sense of frenzy that imbues these men's survival. I meant to observe the rhythm of their movements in their daily struggle, cut by cut. My interest laid on the discovery of a documentary language written on the basis of the swinging movements in their work. My aim was to approach weariness through hypnotic extenuation and tension from a cinematographic form based on such alliteration.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g3YAi4xN17iCYW5wub3qeTpmsLW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Xe9O5qMUDfI"}
