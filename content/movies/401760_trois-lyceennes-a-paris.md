Then there's a slow tune and the only young male guest at the party (Pjotr Stanislas) asks her to dance. During the dance they sneak into an alcove and have sex, hidden (but not very well) by some flimsy strands forming a curtain. Her mother discovers them in flagrante and Iris is thrown out of her home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/DcafPGEXW9cuGBI7TaVZrS8C4n.jpg", "actors": ["Marilyn Jess ()", "C\u00e9line Galone ()", "Mika Barthel ()", "Piotr Stanislas ()", "Maryse Sandra ()", "Raymond Gil ()", "Tony L\u00e9veill\u00e9 ()", "Jacques Marbeuf ()", "Jean-Paul Bride ()", "Marl\u00e8ne Simon ()", "Ghislain Van Hove ((as Claude Loir))", "Carmen Heredia ()", "Ren\u00e9 Marquant ()", "Monique Pascual ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
