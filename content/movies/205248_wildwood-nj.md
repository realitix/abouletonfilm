Wildwood, NJ moves beyond gum-cracking, big hair, and press-on nails to look into the souls of women raised on the boardwalks rides, lights and come-ons. Grandmothers and go-go girls; girls who work as vampires in boardwalk haunted houses. Tween girls stretching out on their first trip without their parents: young, rangy a little drunk on Bud, dukes up, nose open, with a couppla\u2019 bucks to burn. A Wildwood honeymoon, virginity lost to a boardwalk stranger, fistfights, madness, babies \u2014 and no matter what \u2014 returning to Wildwood year after year as they grow up and grow old. \u2014Ruthlessfilms.com", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3RF5vZitDSdnmRWQyLLrT6hVV9j.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
