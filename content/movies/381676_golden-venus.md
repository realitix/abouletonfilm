Mirielle Balin stars as Judith, the mistress of ruthless oil magnate Harfstrong (Jacques Copeau). What Harfstrong doesn't know is that Judith is a spy for his hated business rival. When he does find out, he cannot get rid of her because she knows too much about his own crooked dealings. After several more reels of mutual betrayal and recriminations, the story suddenly shifts to the \"good\" characters, clean-limned young pilot Andre (Daniel Lecourtois) and his sweetheart Michelle (Andree Giuze). Set up as a fall guy for the villains, Andre somehow emerges from the experience none the worse for wear.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1mKuXTrogVbyeDCJgonj7wq0qcH.jpg", "actors": ["Mireille Balin (Judith)", "Jacques Copeau (Harfstrong)", "Daniel Lecourtois (Andr\u00e9 de Saint-Guillon)", "Andr\u00e9e Guize (Mich\u00e8le)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
