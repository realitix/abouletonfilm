The zeitgeist exhibited at these conventions was not lost on the band and in 1996 they responded, rising up like a grease painted phoenix into a new era of success. On the surface, KISS fans got exactly what they longed for, but for some the return of their idols brought unexpected consequences. KISS Loves You follows a few KISS fans along the way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ecepSXBI3KIbB25yGgx4mbOy9ie.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Criss (Himself)", "Gene Simmons (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
