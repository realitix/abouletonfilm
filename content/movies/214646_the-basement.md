The murder of James Fusaro had gangland signs, the newspapers shouted. As the news continued and rumors spread, the humiliation, shame, and fear of more violent attacks by Mafia, silenced the Fusaros. This silence was not without consequences; it became malignant and destroyed the family.  By the time Darrell was 18, his close-knit Italian-American family, who celebrated so many good times together in their grandparents basement kitchen, was no more. In the documentary, The Basement, we witness this regular guy do extraordinary things through his acceptance, generosity and sense of humor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/BDDVtucy824NoKpK7pqHFC38pr.jpg", "actors": ["Darrell Fusaro (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
