Despite being physically and mentally abused, Wei unbelievably escaped the heavily guarded 'Comfort Station' pregnant, shamed, and unsure of what fate awaited her return home. This documentary presents the true legendary story of Wei Shaolan and follows her traumatic and courageous journey from forced prostitution to life today with her Japanese son. 'Real Heroes' are people who can face life bravely even after a tormented life, and Wei's story offers inspiration to those faced with seemingly hopeless adversity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2xeqqrLRzOfFFuQgLFbDXZzud0l.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
