For some reason, he believes that his larcenous ways will bring him prosperity in the country which at one time or another has had rulership over a large portion of the globe. While there, he meets Rosie McCratchit (Pamela McMyler), a lovely Irish gal who could do with some improvement in her fortunes as well. Together, they have a series of legal, quasi-legal and definitely illegal adventures, including Duke's cow-roping and Rosie's response to the mud-wrestling challenge of the Amazon Lady, as well as an attempted armored-car robbery.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/duRUmKsl6yFnNWN52yWJBYejKsF.jpg", "actors": ["David Soul (Duke Turnbeau)", "Pamela McMyler (Rosie McCratchit)", "Michael Balfour (Sam)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
