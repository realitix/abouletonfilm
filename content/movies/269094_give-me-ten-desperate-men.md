Set in the period just before Israel gained its status as an independent nation, the drama shows the occupants of the kibbutz engaged in typical hard work. They have to find a source of water, construct their buildings, and do all the chores needed to stay alive, and these pressures as well as the times in which they live cause tensions to rise. The mix of kibbutzim covers a wide range of personality types, from the deeply religious to the ingrained soldier.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vjSEbZYNa4blkb2gSw1LzI94ZB9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
