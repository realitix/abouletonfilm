The subject of the film is suggested by the spanish title. From \"roda\", I kept 2 connected meanings : the circular motion and movie shooting. As for \"Morfosis\", it is linked to the idea of metamorphosis. With the whole word, I wanted to suggest a metamorphosis of reality (places and characters) in a motion where everything is going round circles : what is on camera, camera itself and film inside.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tMmwlXQCDO1edmMalRIrnUz0ZcM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
