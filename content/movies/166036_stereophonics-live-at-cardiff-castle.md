There\u2019s no rubbish going on--no nice haircuts or leather trousers. They\u2019re a proper band.\" More than that, they come across as indie\u2019s answer to the classic power trio--assuming anyone remembers the question--belting out an amazing set to a 10,000 strong audience in the gorgeous grounds of Cardiff Castle on a glorious summer\u2019s day in 1998. Fans will find all their favourites here, and the perfectly captured atmosphere is effectively the band\u2019s fourth member", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k82kO5Y0gUnZtPmNbbOYrgHZR7L.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
