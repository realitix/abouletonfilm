Dunham wrote a short film for Sunday night's YouTube Music Awards about a heartbroken guy (Nick Lashaway) whose ex-girlfriend (Hudgens) is hooking up with a daft DJ (Shannon). Things start to look up for the protagonist when he meets an impetuous young woman (Dree Hemingway), but the pleasure is only fleeting thanks to the film's finale, which was chosen by the viewing audience: \"a double tragedy\" in the vein of \"Romeo &amp; Juliet\" set to the beat of Avicii's \"Wake Me Up\" and played for laughs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/keziETmZQ2gZYUQ0Ulj3zbk1LMX.jpg", "actors": ["Nick Lashaway (Guy)", "Dree Hemingway (Girl)", "Vanessa Hudgens (Ex-Girlfriend)", "Michael Shannon (Avicii)", "Jason Schwartzman ()", "Joel Garland ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
