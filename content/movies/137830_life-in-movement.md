However before she could take up the position, she was struck and killed by a truck in the middle of the night. Admired internationally as a dancer and celebrated for her fresh choreographic voice, she was known as a dedicated artist, intelligent, dorky, funny and generous. 18 months after her death her collaborators embark on a world tour of her work, and in the process they must deal with their grief and explore the reasons for her death. Interspersed with intimate footage of her artistic process and previously unseen interviews, Life in Movement is a film about moving creatively through life and loss. Filmmakers Bryan Mason and Sophie Hyde give us a powerfully rendered take on art and artists, creativity and our own mortality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w5nosfSlZPZRtuCra1hoNDEM25w.jpg", "actors": ["Tanja Liedtke ((archive footage))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
