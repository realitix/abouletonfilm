This 10-minute anti-war film lost to posterity was a very loose adaptation of Franz Kafka's short story In the Penal Colony. Vesely presents the execution of a prisoner of war as a serial event that happens over and over again, ad nauseum. As of this project, Tichat worked as set designer and occasional co-author for Vesely, here also appearing in front of the camera as an actor together with H.C. Artmann. Gerhard Ruhm contributed his Musique concrete to the soundtrack.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
