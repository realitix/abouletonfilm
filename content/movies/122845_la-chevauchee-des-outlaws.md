It's just after the American Civil War, and a former Confederate officer, Mike Summers (Don Taylor) has taken refuge in a small town in the valley. He has married and is hoping to live in peace the rest of his life. Instead, he and his wife and the rest of the town are suffering the depredations of a brutal gunman, Danny Pose (Alex Nicol), and his gang of outlaws. Summers holds off picking up a gun because of his personal vow of non-violence. But the situation deteriorates and a new ally comes into the picture, Steve Fallon (Richard Basehart), a wandering gunslinger who may not be able to handle the bad guys alone.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2MpdN4O3JMFKA22GfBUePdWi9Gf.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Basehart (Steve Fallon)", "Paquita Rico (Franchea)", "Don Taylor (Mike Summers)", "Alex Nicol (Danny Pose)", "Jos\u00e9 Nieto (Ortega)", "Fernando Rey (Don Hern\u00e1n)", "Mar\u00eda Granada (Juana (as Manolita Barroso))", "F\u00e9lix Fern\u00e1ndez (Paco)", "Francisco Camoiras (Manolo)", "Sergio Mendiz\u00e1bal (Mayor of Buenavista)", "Rafael Albaic\u00edn (Gonzales)", "Jos\u00e9 Manuel Mart\u00edn (Segura)", "V\u00edctor Bayo (Sanchez)", "Pilar Caballero (Sanchez' Wife)", "Xan das Bolas (Cantinero pedro)", "Manuel Pe\u00f1a (Gomez)", "Alfonso Rojas (Ruiz)", "Rafael Vaquero (Sacerdote)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
