Soo-myung has been institutionalized since he was nineteen after the trauma caused by his mother's suicide, and has a phobia of scissors. Seung-min is sane and a champion paraglider, but was forcibly committed by his greedy half-brother to get Seung-min's share of the family inheritance. Soo-myung is a model patient, peacefully and passively spending his days in the hospital despite its abusive nurses, unlike Seung-min, who is a walking time bomb. Soon, Soo-myung gets roped into Seung-min's reckless plan to break out of the hospital.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wWjxNWzDyQXZjsrcpBStDLfCpqR.jpg", "actors": ["Lee Min-ki (Seung-min)", "Yeo Jin-goo (Soo-myung)", "Yu Oh-seong (Choi Ki-hoon)", "Kim Jung-tae (Kim Yong)", "Shin Goo (Mountain teacher)", "Han Hye-rin (Yoon Bo-ra)", "Kim Bo-ra (Eun-yi)", "Yun Yeong-keol (NIS agent)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [453127], "youtube_key": "bSyCT4jqO80"}
