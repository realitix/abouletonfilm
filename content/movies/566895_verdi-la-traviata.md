This new production features J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Rhorer, conducting his ensemble Le Cercle de l\u2019Harmonie, who has decided to perform Verdi\u2019s work - probably for the first time in Paris - in the original 432 Hz tuning in which it was composed and which Verdi consistently proclaimed was its \u201cnatural harmony\u201d. The cast assembled here brings together the pick of the talented crop of \u201cthirty-something\u201d French singers which has blossomed in recent seasons. British director Deborah Warner, who is steeped in Shakespearian theatre tradition which is unrivalled for its exploration of the world of passions, treachery and the whole gamut of human situations, stages this production.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u6BdKmXOc3R5cvoxzXpgcgeSz7V.jpg", "actors": ["Vannina Santoni (Violetta)", "Saimir Pirgu (Alfredo)", "Laurent Naouri (Giorgio Germont)", "J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Rhorer (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "wozOGQFXqpo"}
