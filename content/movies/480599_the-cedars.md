The story is a gradually unfolding spiritual crisis, juxtaposed through two central characters: a young child, full of curiosity and wonderment, and a hard-working, 32 year-old butcher struggling to begin his own family life. It ultimately exposes the harsh social difficulties in sustaining a modest, middle-class life within the contemporary American culture of systemic decay.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/64592sIetIR0Wm1kS7SOmw6nEGv.jpg", "actors": ["Sean Adams (Sean)", "Daniel Bittleston (Homeless Man)", "Steve Capasso (Butcher Boss)", "Lindsay Castillo (Pooh)", "Judy Cerda (Butcher Customer 2)", "Shara Free (Woman in Car)", "Sierra Joy Long (Child)", "Kalikata M'Bula (Healer)", "Lauren Anderson (Clara)", "Rubin Ramirez (Pedro)", "Susan Shay (Evelyn)", "Jonathan Thymius (Ron)", "Yahel Ben Levi Townsend (Man in Car)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
