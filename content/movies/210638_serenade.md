During his stay he rediscovers the music of harana - a long-forgotten tradition of Filipino serenading when men sang under the window at night to fearlessly declare their love for a woman.  Intent on unearthing these unheralded songs, Florante travels to the remote provinces where he discovers three of the last surviving practitioners - a farmer, a fisherman and a tricycle driver. Astounded by their golden voices, Florante asks them to travel with him to perform and record these unknown songs. During their travels, the haranistas meet Brian, a shy young man who for years has been secretly in love with a schoolmate. The haranistas, who have not serenaded in the last thirty years, offered their services to serenade Brian's object of affection, resulting in one of the most tender moments of genuine harana captured on film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/89EUYkebepo54Ho1cm6YeZGR6QK.jpg", "actors": ["Florante Aguilar (Himself)", "Celestino Aniel (Himself)", "Romeo Bergunio (Himself)", "Felipe Alonzo (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "r-1U1a3p3N8"}
