Published in 1731, it is the seventh and final volume of M\u00e9moires et aventures d'un homme de qualit\u00e9 (Memoirs and Adventures of a Man of Quality). It was controversial in its time and was banned in France upon publication. Despite this, it became very popular and pirated editions were widely distributed. In a subsequent 1753 edition, the Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost toned down some scandalous details and injected more moralizing disclaimers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qYGLhQOtb4Q20p6xOrmu7Wi4Y1Q.jpg", "actors": ["Renata Scotto (Manon Lescaut)", "Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (Des Grieux)", "Pablo Elvira (Lescaut)", "Renato Capecchi (Geronte di Ravoir)", "James Levine (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
