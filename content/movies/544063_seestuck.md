Conversations meander from Caspar David Friedrich to Copernicus, Rousseau and Kant, or simply life itself. Present concerns address the sea's threatened ecosystem and political frictions among the neighbouring countries. One universal truth applies for the small Baltic Sea too: The landscape is a window to the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7Q3bMhMO9DgLAcQdWDaXjhY5EOv.jpg", "actors": ["Volker Koepp (Himself (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
