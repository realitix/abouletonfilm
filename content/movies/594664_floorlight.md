The camera does not take its focus off the underpass ground. In the beginning of the piece, Ohtani films the floor as he walks, and the paving looks like any ordinary paving. When he stops and repeatedly zooms focus on the floor, the pale floor reflected by fluorescent light starts to transfigure into some cosmic form; a field of clouds or an ocean surface. Eventually, when the humming of the film particles vibrate the light on the floor like a mysterious organism, we encounter the power of minimal gaze that can only be expressed with 8mm film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/35BSD4hooHNWAz8p3fhUbxfLN7O.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
