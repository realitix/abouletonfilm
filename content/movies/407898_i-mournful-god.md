The girl, however, prefers famous men and Adolf thus does not have a single chance with her. One day in a hospital, he meets a Greek partisan named Apostolek (Pavel Landovsk\u00fd) who impresses him with his spontaneity and ease in solving all problems, especially those with women. Adolf has an idea for a revenge. He makes Apostolek familiar with social manners, dresses him after the latest fashion and introduces him to Janicka as a Greek conductor. Janicka instantly falls in love with the made-up composer and Apostolek does no better.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p1m8WOc1RR0wH24rCvJI9D5jEsP.jpg", "actors": ["Milo\u0161 Kopeck\u00fd (Adolf)", "Hana Lelitov\u00e1 (Janicka Mal\u00e1tov\u00e1)", "Pavel Landovsk\u00fd (Apostol Certikidis)", "Ji\u0159ina Jir\u00e1skov\u00e1 (Mrs. Stenclov\u00e1)", "Ivana Mixov\u00e1 (Cantatrice)", "Kvetoslava Houdlov\u00e1 (Oculist)", "Pavla Mar\u0161\u00e1lkov\u00e1 (Mrs. Mal\u00e1tov\u00e1 - mother)", "Zden\u011bk Kryz\u00e1nek (Mr. Mal\u00e1t - father)", "Ilona Jirotkov\u00e1 (Girlfriend)", "Daniela Pokorn\u00e1 (Girlfriend)", "Boleslava Svobodov\u00e1 (Ruzena)", "Milivoj Uzelac (Conductor)", "Helena Bendov\u00e1 (Housekeeper)", "Vladim\u00edr Klemens (Music-master)", "Jan V\u00ed\u0161ek (Doctor)", "Otakar Chaloupka (Conductor Orechovsk\u00fd-Bursk\u00fd)", "Anton\u00edn Kachl\u00edk (Director of the operetta)", "Franti\u0161ek Kub\u00ed\u010dek (Waiter)", "Marie Fingerov\u00e1 (Women)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
