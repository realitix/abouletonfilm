Nearby, people sit in a crowded restaurant. Detached from those around them, they eat, mumble and fantasize without any passion or engagement. A waitress apathetic recites the specials. Two men literally pass through each other near the toilets. These people have shelter and food, but they aren't alive. The restaurant almost becomes a security blanket, a place to hide from their crazy, mundane and trapped existence. The mad street preacher is a lone voice of conviction and delusion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/90wHTiQrhNT3GLgx0D8ebPeX37u.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
