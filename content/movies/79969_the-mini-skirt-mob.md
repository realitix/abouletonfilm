{"tmdb_id": 79969, "title": "The Mini-Skirt Mob", "original_title": "The Mini-Skirt Mob", "slug_title": "the-mini-skirt-mob", "date": "1968-05-23", "genre": ["Action / Thriller"], "score": "5.0/10", "synopsis": "Diane McBain, who'd been a sort of star at Warner Bros. in the early 1960s, is the leading lady of The Mini-Skirt Mob. She's in charge of a fearsome (and toothsome) gang of biker chicks, even though she herself looks as though she'd go into conniptions over a broken nail. McBain's mob gets its kicks terrorizing a sweet young married couple. The film is a veritable roll-call of fading TV icons, including Jeremy Slate and Sherry Jackson; only cycle-flick veterans Ross Hagen and Harry Dean Stanton seem truly comfortable in these low-octane surroundings. The Mini-Skirt Mob is the sort of picture that used to be described as \"ideal drive-in fare\" back in Days of Old when there were drive-ins.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2jvMtU7bSq7lAE281Mt7pGaTIvF.jpg", "actors": ["Diane McBain (Shayne)", "Jeremy Slate (Lon)", "Sherry Jackson (Connie)", "Ross Hagen (Jeff Logan)", "Patty McCormack (Edie)", "Harry Dean Stanton (Spook)", "Ronnie Rondell Jr. (L.G.)", "Barbro Hedstr\u00f6m (Bea)", "Sandra Marshall (Fran)", "Steve Balazs (Hank)", "Robert Shelton (Carl)", "Jacquie Rohr (Biker Gang Member)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "62DGcaHL7B8"}
