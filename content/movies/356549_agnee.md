The making, action sequences, drama,photography, music, background score are simply astounding.It's a giant leap for the commercial Bangladeshi movie into a new era. The plot and sequences are crisp and devoid of any redundancy. The plot though sometimes reminded me of the 2011 French-American action film \"Colombiana\". A girl prepare herself for the revenge of the gruesome murder of her parents and train herself for the same and ended up killing them all.But, the narration of the story in celluloid was very masterful and drew a huge Bangladeshi crowd to the theaters after such a long time.Certainly the kudos goes to the whole teams and crews of \"Agni\". The tile song \"Ami Agni\" was a rock number and well-suited for such an action thriller.We want to see such entertaining and well produced movies from Bangladeshi Film Industry in the days to come."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
