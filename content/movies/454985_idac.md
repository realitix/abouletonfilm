We shared classes and had friends in common but for some strange reason I never introduced myself. All during college, and then into the real world, through a decade of overlapping connections, we never met. This film is an examination of that hesitation and an attempt to understand why I never made the easiest connection in the world\u2026 until it was too late. Through archival footage and re-enactment of the era in question, IDAC is ultimately a documentary about what was happening on an unconscious level and how distant a relative can be even when they\u2019re right in front of your face.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Casimir Nozkowski (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
