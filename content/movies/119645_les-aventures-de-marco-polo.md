Sherwood and N.A. Pogson. It stars Gary Cooper, Alan Hale, Binnie Barnes, Basil Rathbone,Sigrid Gurie, George Barbier and Ernest Truex. Music is by Hugo Friedhofer and cinematography by Rudolph Mat\u00e9 and Archie Stout.\r\n\r\nAdventurer Marco Polo (Cooper) travels to China, where he finds the Emperor Kublai Khan (Barbier) and a wshole bunch of revolutionary intrigue.\r\n\r\nThe legend of Marco Polo has proven to be spurious, so it's no surprise to find that a 1938 filmic production of the man is wholly fanciful. This is not a bad film, in fact it's a pleasant enough way to spend an hour and 40 minutes with. Problem is is that it's pitched more at gentle comedy then anything remotely dramatic.\r\n\r\nCast are having fun performing in a costumer (Rathbone on villain duties owns the pic), but you have to cringe at some of the era foibles that sees various races playing the wrong race. The action is competently staged, particularly the final siege and battle, though the speeding up of some sequences is too daft.\r\n\r\nLikable cast make it worth staying with, but really they could have just made a character up and made this film as it is. 5/10"}], "recommandations_id": []}
