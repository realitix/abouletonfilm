Our tastes may be groomed by the media, but how we feel about how we look brings our self-image into focus. Armed with something more potent than lip gloss - a mouth so shocking and raunchy it should be stamped with a warning - Cho toured America with her manifesto: \"This show is really about how we should feel beautiful,\" says Cho. \"When you feel beautiful, you're going to have more of a willingness to use your voice to speak.\" Shot at the Long Beach Terrace Theater, Cho's latest stand-up concert film, Beautiful, explores the good, bad, and downright ugly in beauty, and the unattractive politicians and marketers who shape our world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v0d0SJRFLYGkFIBI5ONmaKGdZuj.jpg", "actors": ["Margaret Cho (Herself)", "Bruce Daniels (Himself)", "Selene Luna (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
