Large blotches of ink fall on the sheets of paper, and become wild African warriors and Harlem jitterbugs as the wind howls outside. Comes the dawn, the storm ends, and the inky figures return to the inkwell. The maid comes in to clean the workroom, and finds nothing by ink smudges on scattered sheets of paper.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Walter Lantz (Cartoonist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
