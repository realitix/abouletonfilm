She is compliant, which makes her an easy target for men. She's religious, believing she is God's favorite child; she searches for Jesus. She has sent a letter to a filmmaker suggesting her life as the subject for a movie. We see her raped than take up with a series of men she believes are Jesus, each willing or insistent on sex. A young man with his own crisis of faith invites her to join a cult. We see her involuntarily committed to an asylum from time to time where medication and constraints await. Her wealthy parents are helpless. Will a medical professional ever talk to her? If one did, would it help?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qMuFuckRtqI9voDt8qL724kB4NS.jpg", "actors": ["Elisabeth Stepanek (Veronika Christoph)", "Nguyen Chi Danh (Der Erste)", "Karl Heinz Reimann (Kind Gottes)", "Jorge Reis (Demba)", "Carola Regnier (\u00c4rztin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
