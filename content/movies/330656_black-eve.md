The department store was the site of a grizzly murder/suicide years before and now... it's the perfect location for a wild Halloween party. Two floors, fifty thousand square feet, loud music, booze, sexy Halloween costumes, and one uninvited guest. It's one hell of a night and by morning the only survivor, a woman with psychic abilities, is pitted in a cat and mouse game with the killer, running from room to room and using her powers to retrace the final steps of the other guests.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vAEWWPouYkxxkXCE1NJFiRzvclU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
