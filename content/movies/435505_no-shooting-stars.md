Dream-like scenes drift in dissonance with a narration that has no beginning or end. It unfolds like a poem that is affected by the ocean\u2019s secrets but offers no explanation about who is living under the water\u2019s surface, instead meandering through loops of imagination. The image of who exactly the narrator is slips away as soon as it takes shape, reflecting the logic of the unstable grounds of water space.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zSBxAgoSadPcKZuBGhjnLxusLIh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
