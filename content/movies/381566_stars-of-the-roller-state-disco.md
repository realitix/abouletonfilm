Unemployed youngsters spend their days at the roller disco of the title, circling round and round, before being called to take up low-paid jobs as they become available. They leave the building in a wash of light, though we do not go through that door with them. For others it's a subsistence existence of vending machine food, video games, with sex and drug freely available as distractions.
