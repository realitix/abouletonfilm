Raw concrete and cold clean lines in a functionalist style were in line with society's development, but in stark contrast to what the church had previously represented. The film portrays 25 of these churches from all over the country", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iwqAaGkMWg4gHs2I6tfqIC8ytxG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
