The question is only if that was the meaning or a tragic accident. Through Ronny's regret of what he has done and his struggle to defend himself from a long prison sentence, we will follow the Danish legal system from within in a completely unique and extraditable way. For the first time ever, cameras will follow a whole trial in Denmark.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
