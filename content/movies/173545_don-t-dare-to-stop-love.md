An abstract exploration of her relationships with both her young lover and teenage daughter, the film shows us the tortures of a self-indulgent mind. In a plea for affection, she devotes the last months of her life taking care of \"Pet,\" her boyfriend. This, however, turns sour when her excessive need for pity becomes too much for him to bear.  Intercut with sketches of her teenage daughter gossiping about her mother\u2019s strange behaviour, we develop a compassion for the lead. Will she succumb to the darkness of her own mind or will she be inspired to overcome her fate?  \u00a9 Julia Wiese", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
