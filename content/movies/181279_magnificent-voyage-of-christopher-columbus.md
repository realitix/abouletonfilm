Yet remarkably, the great explorer went to his grave ignorant of his great accomplishment, unaware that he had discovered two vast continents. The forces that Columbus unknowingly set in motion brought about a profound transformation in America, Europe, and, in short order, Africa and Asia.  His voyage initiated a tremendous transoceanic migration of peoples, plants, and diseases that, for better and often for worse, affected everyone on the globe.  It also made him a legend, turning Columbus into a powerful symbol of both exploration and exploitation. The Magnificent Voyage of Christopher Columbus recounts the history and epic adventure of Columbus' first Atlantic crossing, as a modern-day crew retraces Columbus' course, sailing replicas of his fleet.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oQjqfYeFAoPupnuHxa8YgFjjuAT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
