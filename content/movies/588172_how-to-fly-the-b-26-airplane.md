Dick, the captain charged with pilot instruction, leads Jim through every aspect of preparation to fly the bomber, going through a detailed checklist of pre-flight procedures, long before he allows Jim to turn an engine over. Once preparations are completed, Dick shows Jim the process of starting the engines, followed by take-off. In the air, further instruction helps Jim understand the various limits and capabilities of the aircraft. When one engine fails, Dick must simultaneously guide the limping plane back to a safe landing and explain to Jim each step of the procedure.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Don Porter (Captain Dick)", "Craig Stevens (Lieutenant Jim Anthony)", "Frank Wilcox (Colonel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
