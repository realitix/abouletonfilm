Images of frames and framed materials recur. Pages of a dictionary flip by, and it is here that the viewer can see a reference to Will Hindle. Entry words echo his film titles - Billabong, Chinese Firedrill etc. A soft-focus female nude, reminiscent of an Edward Weston photograph, becomes increasingly scratched as the footage runs, a memento mori of the plastic material itself. Much, the film tells us, is beautiful, and much will be forgotten.\u201d (Tom Whiteside)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n0CjXvMVGhv6eqrMdr6T88BuchN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
