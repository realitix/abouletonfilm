Reagan saw first-hand the brutality, destruction and oppression that defined the communist party as it attempted to overtake the unions to convert them into propaganda mills for the Soviet Union. The strike incited in him a call to action and an unshakeable belief that communism was a \"form of insanity\" which must be wiped from the earth. From SAG President, to GE Spokesman, Governor of California and finally, to President of the United States, this film chronicles the rise of Ronald Reagan, his unwavering conviction that America was the world's last best hope of man, and shows why he is hero to over a billion people who he helped free from the bonds of Soviet domination.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5AeaZ6agMfpU67IsDHKTSTASyz5.jpg", "actors": ["Irene Ziegler (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
