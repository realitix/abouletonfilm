The six-voice a cappella group was formed in 1996 and comprises graduates from the Norwegian Academy of Music and the Norwegian Academy of Opera, who, in addition to their singing backgrounds, have a broad range of experience from choral conducting to teacher training and composition. It is perhaps this range of interests that leads them to explore a wider than usual spectrum of musical expression, from plainchant to new works commissioned from leading Norwegian composers; from the most sacred of religious texts to the definitely profane. Nordic Voices  are an unusual blend of sophisticated music-making and stylish performance, more often than not with more than a dash of humour.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/70ezjQ04wUY15FFgYvkF5b3uJdJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
