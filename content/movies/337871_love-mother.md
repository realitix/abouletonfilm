The scene is the villa apartment almost finished, where the tourist guide mother, father who also works for the second economy and the lonely big girl preparing for her maturity examination turn up alternatively. It is only the teen-ager boy who really \"lives\" in this place: instead of attending school he stays home all day and observes the life of the surrounding by a self-made periscope. Internal communication of the family is accomplished in writing, on the pin-up board in the kitchen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3SG86l8WjRCFPRzPoIlH3W0YQsl.jpg", "actors": ["R\u00f3bert Koltai (Kalm\u00e1r G\u00e9za)", "Dorottya Udvaros (Kalm\u00e1r Joli)", "Katalin Lajtai (Kalm\u00e1r Mari)", "Simon G\u00e9vai (Peti Kalm\u00e1r (as G\u00e9vai G.
