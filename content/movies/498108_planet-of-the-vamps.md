The tale is brought to life with all the opulence that an $800 budget can produce and the young cast of non-actors live up to their fullest foibles as the plot thickens with a mix of romance and wartime action intertwined with a musical number or two. The ambitions were high and the necklines low in this effects-laden tribute to pulp fiction fantasy and intergalactic intercourse.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hZra7OmT3UOB3Fmvi5Q3wHKApXH.jpg", "actors": ["Devendra Banhart ()", "Damen Corrado ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
