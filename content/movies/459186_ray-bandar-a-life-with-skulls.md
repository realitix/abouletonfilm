Usually dressed in tattered \"field-trip\" clothes, Ray Bandar has been a fixture at the California Academy of Sciences and the beaches around the San Francisco Bay Area for more than 60 years.  \"A Life with Skulls\" captures Ray's obsession for collecting skulls from local beaches, road kill, zoo animals and on field trips to Mexico, Australia and in the United States. This humorous movie investigates Bandar's history as a skull collector, showing many of the thousands of skulls he has accumulated over the years, talking to Alkmene, his resilient wife, and touring the awe-inspiring Bone Palace.  \"A Life with Skulls\" is an inspiring look at a man who has a special tie to the natural world. You will be motivated to go out and explore it for yourself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yXkAUEfFFnHEpJgal7pLlvuOIoW.jpg", "actors": ["Raymond Bandar (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
