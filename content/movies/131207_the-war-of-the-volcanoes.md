Meanwhile, Anna Magnani, one of Italy\u2019s biggest stars and Rossellini\u2019s longtime lover, was furious. When the Rossellini/Bergman project was announced as a tale set on Stromboli, one of the volcanic Aeolian Islands, Magnani quickly set up her own Aeolian project, financed by Hollywood, to be called Volcano. Italy\u2019s tabloids simply went wild: the prospect of these two great divas battling it out with rival productions was breathlessly followed, especially as it became clear that the Rossellini/Bergman relationship was more than professional. Francesco Patierno has created an engrossing, revealing and highly entertaining chronicle of this cinematic battle royal.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oAJEWcIFnmRubEs2d4anHRM8njQ.jpg", "actors": ["Ingrid Bergman (Herself (Archive footage))", "Roberto Rossellini (Himself (Archive footage))", "Anna Magnani (Herself (Archive footage))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
