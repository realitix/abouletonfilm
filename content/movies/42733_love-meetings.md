He periodically checks in with Alberto Moravia and Cesare Musatti. Bersani is intrusive and judgemental, prodding those who answer. The film's thesis: despite the booming post-war economy, Italians' attitudes toward sex are either rigidly Medieval (the poor and the South) or muddled and self-censoring (the bourgeoisie and the North).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p7qyozv2VI2dAnZkpE2tiprEcm4.jpg", "actors": ["Pier Paolo Pasolini ()", "Alberto Moravia ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [19930, 84512, 101021, 114246], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
