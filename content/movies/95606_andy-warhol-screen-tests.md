Subjects were captured in stark relief by a strong key light, and filmed by Warhol with his stationary 16mm Bolex camera on silent, black and white, 100-foot rolls of film at 24 frames per second. The resulting two-and-a-half-minute film reels were then screened in 'slow motion' at 16 frames per second.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9I1HXDqTks5Q9Q5xbAGtjiJqvFN.jpg", "actors": ["Edie Sedgwick ()", "Bob Dylan ()", "Nico ()", "Lou Reed ()", "Ann Buchanan ()", "Salvador Dal\u00ed ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
