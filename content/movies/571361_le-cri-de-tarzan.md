One day he visits a local pub and meets barmaid Saliha, the Arab daughter of the bar owner. The two feel an instant connection that is only strengthened by their first kiss. Immediately after their lips part, she trills an Arab cry while he yells like Tarzan. Now, she is everywhere he turns. Eventually, he takes off from his barracks and they have a luxurious tryst on the Isle des Oiseaux. Upon his return he is promptly arrested. Meanwhile Saliha's stern father shuts her safely up in a room. Later, she makes her little brother inform Frederic that she is pregnant. He refuses to acknowledge her, so she threatens to publish explicit details of their weekend in the local paper.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xbrWfw1oTFWWOEpMZebEFRf24YK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
