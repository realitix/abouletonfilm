The dramatic pivot is the conflict between the king who banned animal sacrifice, and the priest who calls for the king's own blood. Emotionally, the film revolves around the childless queen and a beggar girl whose pet goat has been taken for the sacrifice and who loves a servant in the temple.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Master Vithal ()", "Sulochana ()", "Zubeida ()", "Sultana ()", "Jal Khambata ()", "Jani Babu ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
