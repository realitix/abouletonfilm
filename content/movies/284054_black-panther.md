Allow me to disagree (almost) entirely. _Black Panther_ is a great film, not because it breaks the mould, but because Marvel Studios has a successful pattern and _Black Panther_ adheres to it completely. Obviously the importance of a lead who is not just black but actually African is not to be understated, we have the least white cast of any superhero movie to date and they absolutely killed it, all very important socio-political stuff, to be sure. But the bones of _Black Panther_, the plot, the script, the events, the turns, all of that, it's a carbon copy of what's worked 17 times before. It works again, don't get me wrong, _Black Panther_ truly was an experience, both important and fantastic, but to say it re-invented the wheel here, is, to me, an outright lie.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"}, {"pseudo": "hankster3000", "content": "Overrated and overhyped. Definitely avoid. Watch on redbox if you must."}, {"pseudo": "Movie Queen41", "content": "This is definitely one of Marvel's best because the story is compelling and the characters are well developed. Black Panther and his friends and family must defend themselves and their homeland of Wakanda from the clutches of Klau (Andy Serkis) and Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). Not only is the lead actor great as T'Challa/Black Panther, but the supporting cast does a fine job as well, especially the female actors. T'Challa is surrounded by smart, strong women. Marvel seems to break its villain curse with Klau and especially Killmonger. Killmonger is very well developed and even sympathetic at times, despite his villainy. He sort of reminded me of Tom Hiddleston's Loki. The action scenes and special effects are outstanding. Highly recommended if you enjoy comic book movies."}, {"pseudo": "Crenor", "content": "Really good movie. Good story, lots of fun. This is what DC is missing."}, {"pseudo": "Per Gunnar Jonsson", "content": "It was with some hesitation that I went to see this movie. I was afraid that it would be burdened with too much political and social preaching. Especially knowing how much the movie is praised amongst certain factions in our society today. Sure enough there were indeed some of that nonsense but luckily it was much less than I feared.\r\n\r\nI actually found the movie fairly entertaining. It is far from great, certainly very far from the insane hype surrounding it, but pretty okay. It is more or less a standard issue super hero movie on a big budget. Of course this means a fairly mediocre underlying story beefed up with lots of action and special effects.\r\n\r\nThe story itself is a traditional revenge story with some black power stuff. Nothing to write home about but it works as a vehicle for the action and special effects which is what makes this movie. There are the usual nonsense and plot holes in it of course. Like Shuri claiming that Vibranium (silly name but never mind) is instable at high speeds yet they have no problem making flying ships and other fast moving stuff with it.\r\n\r\nThe characters are a wee bit disappointing as far as the main characters are concerned. I felt that the main protagonist has little in terms of charisma. Killmonger, the main bad guy, was downright disappointing. To me he looked like the stereotype of a dumb thug and mostly he behaved like one. Bloody hell could they not have found an actor that looked less\u2026well\u2026stupid!\r\n\r\nPersonally the character I liked best was actually Klaue which was pretty cool, insane but cool. The female warriors, which were both kick-ass and smart, and Shuri is also fairly high up on my approval list.\r\n\r\nSpecial effects! This is of course where this movie shines. Overall I think the special effects were good. The design of the various gadgets, ships etc were very nice. The rampaging rhinos in the final fight really made me laugh. I should have seen that coming. I definitely liked all the sonic effects. Obviously this movie would have been more or less null if the special effects would not have been a success.\r\n\r\nOn the whole Black Panther is a quite enjoyable special effects and action movie. Nothing more, nothing less. Some social preaching nonsense but less than I feared, hum ho story, lots of action and lots of special effects."}, {"pseudo": "OblateSphereDroid", "content": "I was really surprised how much I liked this movie.  There was so much going on; immigration concerns; the fight between saving the world and protecting your own country(sound familiar); the fear of an African country\u2019s resources being pillaged; how best to handle the problems black people face worldwide; and many great authentic feeling cultural nods.  All this while not being heavy or preachy.  You can definitely eat popcorn to this.  The villain; Killmonger, is great.  Not great in that he is scary, though he is, but because he is more complex than some shadowy figure you should just trust is a bad guy because of visual effects or dramatic music.  \r\n\r\nThis movie isn\u2019t just explosions and one-liners in an exotic location.  This is a great movie in general.  It\u2019s always interesting.  There are great relationships between all the characters.  Finally; Wakanda is really a place.  It feels alive and lived in; not just impressive buildings used as a backdrop.  They did a wonderful job of worldbuilding; from the rituals, to the clothing, fancy tech, and scenery.  This movie is definitely worth a watch. \r\n\r\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606-1/2\r\n\r\nI also have to add that; you get to actually see Andy Serkis!  When I saw his name I thought we was going to be some kind of CGI monster.  I\u2019m just happy to see him get actual screen time."}, {"pseudo": "Dsnake1", "content": "The Black Panther is a fun romp, but it definitely has some issues. First, the good.\r\n\r\nThe action is fun, the emotions hit home, and the story isn't dirt-poor. \r\n\r\nWhile the CGI gets ripped on from time to time, I thought it was solid enough for a Marvel movie. The fight scenes were relatively well-choreographed, as well. The ritual combat scenes were exciting and visually appealing. The fights in Korea were also fun to see, and while I'm not a fan of car chase scenes as a whole, I did enjoy this one. It was reminiscent of a James Bond movie. \r\n\r\nIn fact, that's another appeal, at least to me. The secret technology base and the fun action scenes were a great callback to James Bond-type movies. I do think the movie would have been complemented by giving T'Challa a similar vice as Bond's, although Marvel probably wouldn't veer down that line for the seemingly morally absolute King of Wakanda.\r\n\r\nThe story, well, it's a mixed bag. Everything seemed crammed together with major emotional keys being rushed through or somewhat ignored. The concept is fine though. A long lost relative comes to challenge the new king, wins, and shows his colors, becoming something amoral. The king comes back and takes down the usurper, realizing something about themselves/their kingdom in the process. It's tired, but not so tired it damages the movie. \r\n\r\nThis is where the issues begin to rise, though. The movie is really a movie and a half or two movies crammed into one. Wakanda has a ton of wonderful mythology, but almost none of it is explained. The movie never really explains how the Wakandans used vibranium was used to make themselves wealthy. It touches on it in some exposition, but there was much more that was just glossed over. \r\n\r\nIn addition, W'Kabi became radicalized by Killmonger much too quickly for such a pivotal relationship to flip. Some of the emotional aspects of the movie fell flat because they weren't given enough screen time. \r\n\r\nDespite its flaws, Black Panther is a fun movie that adds to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It should have been two movies, but I doubt this is the last we'll see of Wakanda."}, {"pseudo": "DanDare", "content": "The character of T'Challa made his debut in Captain America 3: Civil War.\r\n\r\nIn Black Panther, T'Challa returns to his homeland of Wakanda after the death of his father who has been hiding a secret about his brother who lived in the USA. He now inherits the throne after a challenge from a rival.\r\n\r\nWakanda is an african country with wealth, power and immense technology that it hides from the outside world.\r\n\r\nT'Challa's uncle wanted an uprising in the USA. Now his son Killmonger comes to Wakanda and challenges T'Challa for the throne.\r\n\r\nKillmonger wins and leads the struggle for black power.\r\n\r\nBlack Panther is a well made efficient film from Marvel who really have nailed down their formula.

It simply is not that good with a very predictable story."}, {"pseudo": "Wuchak", "content": "Overrated due to political correctness; it\u2019s noble and has its points of interest, but it\u2019s also kinda meh\r\n\t\r\nRELEASED IN 2018 and directed by Ryan Coogler, \"Black Panther\u201d details events when T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman) takes over kingship of the hidden African nation Wakanda after his father passes (John Kani). The kingdom is technologically advanced due to its secret resource Vibranium, a priceless, almost magical metal. Unfortunately, T\u2019Challa\u2019s reign is challenged by an angry American former-black ops soldier, Erik \u201cKillmonger\u201d (Michael B. Jordan).\r\n\r\nWith its black director and mostly black cast (with a couple of token white dudes), \u201cBlack Panther\u201d was overhyped and overrated upon release. Critics were apparently afraid of being called \u201cracist\u201d by liberal fascists if they dared to be honest and say anything negative (rolling my eyes). The movie\u2019s likable and certainly has its points of interest, but the characters are rather dull, except for Killmonger, and the story isn\u2019t all that involving. It\u2019s basically a mediocre superhero movie that has some blatant Bond-isms and is set apart by its primarily black cast and African locale. It fails to rise to the entertainment level of even \u201cAnt-Man\u201d (2015).\r\n\r\nStill, it\u2019s respectfully noble and the story provokes interesting questions, like isolationism vs. internationalism and African-American culture vs. Native African culture. But there\u2019s some eye-rolling bits, like when Shuri (Letitia Wright) calls CIA agent Ross (Martin Freeman) a \u201ccolonizer,\u201d which isn\u2019t even accurate. Maybe it was supposed to be a joke.\r\n\r\nThe waterfall fight between the Black Panther and Killmonger was an homage to the first issue of The Black Panther series in Jungle Action: Issue #6, September, 1973. At the end of that comic\u2019s story T'Challa and Erik fight at the top of a waterfall culminating with Killmonger throwing Black Panther over the cliff. This issue was the beginning of the \"Panther's Rage\" storyline by Don McGregor (featuring artists Billy Graham, Rich Buckler and Gil Kane), which ran for over two years in 13 issues of Jungle Action #6-18 and 209 pages, including the Epilogue. Many consider it the first graphic novel. Of course, this wasn't the first appearance of the Black Panther (who debuted in 1966), but it was the first issue where he was the starring character. \r\n\r\nAnd it was this series that provided the intriguing exposition on T\u2019Challa, Wakanda and its citizens, visitors & enemies. It\u2019s a travesty that McGregor, who created the characters of Killmonger & W\u2019Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) and conceived this exposition, wasn\u2019t acknowledged in this movie; shameful.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 14 minutes and was shot in Georgia (Atlanta, Fayetteville), South Korea (Busan) and Iguaz\u00fa Waterfalls, Argentina. Ironically, nothing was shot in Africa.

Not long after he\u2019s challenged for the throne and war looms over his homeland.\r\n\r\nBlack Panther isn\u2019t your typical hero because let\u2019s face it\u2026 He\u2019s black. And apart from Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and Smeagol (Andy Serkis), everybody\u2019s black. And that\u2019s the way it should be.\r\nThe entire cast delivers. Boseman is excellent as king T\u2019Challa who struggles with his new role. It doesn\u2019t get any easierr when Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) shows up. Killmonger is a mean SOB yet you care for him (some good writing right there). He\u2019s a worthy adversary and one of the better Marvel villains. Jordan portrays him perfectly. Director Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan are a match made in heaven. This is their third collaboration after \u2018Fruitvale Station\u2019 and \u2018Creed\u2019 and again they\u2019re successful. The movie itself gets better as Jordan\u2019s role gets bigger.\r\n\r\nThe female characters and actors are equally impressive. Especially Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) and Okoye (Danai Gurira) steal the show.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s less humour in \u2018Black Panther\u2019 than we\u2019re used to seeing in Marvel films but that\u2019s not a bad thing. The movie doesn\u2019t need it.\r\n\r\nThough it\u2019s set in (fictional) Africa there wasn\u2019t any filming done in Africa. Nonetheless the movie looks right. The makers did a great job of creating Wakanda. Huge props to costume designer Ruth E. Carter and composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson who help bring Wakanda to life.\r\nOn the downside there\u2019s a lot of CGI. Sometimes it\u2019s too obvious (rhinos say hi). Despite that the battle scenes are beautifully choreographed. Especially Okoye wielding her spear is a thing to behold.\r\n\r\nAll in all \u2018Black Panther\u2019 is another wonderful addition to the MCU and we can\u2019t wait to see what role T\u2019Challa and his sidekicks are going to play in \u2018Avengers: Infinity War\u2019."}, {"pseudo": "tmdb44006625", "content": "Black Panther will probably be remembered as a culturally significant film more so than a great one, but that shouldn't take away from the movie's deeper theme of inclusivity.
