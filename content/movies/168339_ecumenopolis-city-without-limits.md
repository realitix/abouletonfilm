It follows the story of a migrant family from the demolition of their neighborhood to their on-going struggle for housing rights. The film takes a look at the city on a macro level and through the eyes of experts, going from the tops of mushrooming skyscrapers to the depths of the railway tunnel under the Bosphorous strait; from the historic neighborhoods in the south to the forests in the north; from isolated islands of poverty to the villas of the rich. It's an Istanbul going from 15 million to 30 million. It's an Istanbul going from 2 million cars to 8 million. It's the Istanbul of the future that will soon engulf the entire region. It's an Istanbul nobody has ever seen before.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bVa6Alv9MI5Vt98jGV2p5q4Kulv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [215653, 215525, 79682, 163857], "youtube_key": "XEzqu_z9fRo"}
