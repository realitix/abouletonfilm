During the day he is in a shelter. He spends the weekend with his father. Because of his autistic disorder, Jeroen is very sensitive to stimuli and he always needs care and guidance. Directors Peter Lataster and Petra Lataster-Czisch follow the life of the adolescent, his mother Anita and his regular companion Kevin for four months.
