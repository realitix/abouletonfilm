This is a typical very early silent film with flimsy sets, a few outdoor scenes (a rocky shore line, dunes), and jerky editing. The acting is all silent exclamatory style and it resembles more a tableaux than a narrative. As was typical of this period, title cards merely explain the action that is about to take place.
