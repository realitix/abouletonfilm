Renzo Montagnani basically plays the same part in both films, but in this one it is Edwige Fenech, not Paola Senatore, who goes sunbathing while he does his gay butler act. Giacomo D'Amato (Renzo) is picked up by widowed countess Magda (Juliette Mayniel) the moment he's released from jail and promptly leaves his girlfriend standing there (remember-her-for-later-on alert). Magda wants Renzo to pose as a butler/chauffeur and seduce her brothers new wife Ines (who is Renzo's ex lover), so Magda can have the inheritance all for herself.\r\n\r\nInes (Susan Scott) is already having late night rendezvous with Magda's teenage son Marco (Roberto Censi and his trademark bad hair cut) and sees through the new Major Domo's gay disguise immediately. Finally Edwige arrives in green hot-pants on her scooter, proving to be an illegitimate love child of the crippled Count by showing the mole on her behind (the other blood relatives join her in the buttock line). As usual, Fenech waists no time and takes off her top for the aforementioned sun bathing scene, arousing the interest of Giacomo and Marco and objections from Ines.\r\n\r\nAs if all this wasn't confusing enough, the whole family keeps double and triple crossing each other to get into good graces with the Count. There is photographic evidence of adulterous affairs, a kidnap plot is foiled before the ransom note is dry, the blonde girlfriend from the start is suddenly the new maid, and a young cook who only appeared once or twice in the background suddenly moves in to seduce Edwige into a lesbian encounter (implied, not shown). Meanwhile Renato's gay act keeps getting more obnoxious (cringe as he hilariously vacuums Freddy Mercury style). When the time comes to go into the accusing parlour for the not so surprising final will and testament, most viewers will have stopped caring about these characters already."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "d3F8jBPpMDM"}
