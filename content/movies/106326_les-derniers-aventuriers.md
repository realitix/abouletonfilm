Much later, as an ambassador\u2019s son in Rome, he\u2019s an emotionally cold playboy who marries solely for wealth (Candice Bergen), but he\u2019s haunted by Corteguay and maintains relations with the dubious dictator (Alan Badel). Ernest Borgnine plays Dax\u2019 spiritual guardian, Fat Cat.\r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s based on Harold Robbins\u2019 book of the same title, which was loosely based on the real-life Porfirio Rubirosa, an oft-married wealthy playboy, diplomat and polo player who had a relationship with the dictator of the Dominican Republic, Rafael Trujillo.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Adventurers\u201d is a curious amalgamation of Hollywood soap opera (e.g. 1967\u2019s \u201cValley of the Dolls\u201d) and Italo-Western-like slaughter with a Euro-robot as the leading man.  The movie vacillates between starving children in South America, disco-a-go-go fashion shows in Rome or New York, machine-gun massacres, hedonistic sex romps and the disingenuous courting of rich women. It\u2019s basically a wannabe \"Doctor Zhivago\" (1965), but lacking that iconic picture\u2019s surreal and compelling artistry.\r\n\r\nThe spectacularly engineered battle sequences were created by the James Bond stunt-genius Bob Simmons, featuring hundreds of real men (played by actual Columbian militants), real tanks, real trains and real planes, all getting blown to pieces before your very eyes with absolutely no CGI.\r\n\r\nThe above reveals many points of interest, but I was well into the second half of the almost-3-hour flick when I realized that none of the characters interested me, particularly the protagonist. I\u2019m not sure if the problem was the script, the story or the actor (Fehmiu), but the drama came across consistently flat. Another problem is the women. While there are several notables besides Bergen (Olivia de Havilland, Leigh Taylor-Young, Delia Boccardo, Jaclyn Smith, etc.) the camera either never captures their beauty or they\u2019re too anorexic to fascinate in the first place. \r\n\r\nOn the positive side, the action-packed conclusion is gripping and the message is timeless: Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 57 minutes and was shot in Colombia (Cartagena & Bogota), Puerto Rico, Italy (Rome & Venice) and New York City.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C"}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
