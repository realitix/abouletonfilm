But then along came John du Pont, an eccentric heir to the family fortune with a passion for wrestling.  His 800-acre Foxcatcher Farm outside Philadelphia became the hub of the sport, with state-of-the-art training facilities, free accommodations, generous stipends and the support of America\u2019s best freestyle wrestlers, brothers Mark and Dave Schultz.  It all seemed too good to be true \u2013 and tragically it was, with a savage ending.  Featuring fresh testimonials and never-before-seen footage, \u201cThe Prince of Pennsylvania\u201d is the story of a paradise lost to the madness of its creator, a man who had the means to buy anything except for the one thing he truly wanted.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8oXAKPmxOiWfmrgl4S4csahr3vG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [270487], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
