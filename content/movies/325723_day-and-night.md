Two close images were taken, with the subject -a heather plant- on a turning platform. The heather blossoms are tiny, on average less than 1/8 inch in size. Color was augmented and transformed via computer. Movement was computer-created by way of an editing-formula of my invention (patented) by which 3D films can be made from 2D imagery exploiting similarities and differences between two adjacent film-frames. Active 3D events appear that impossibly continue in one direction without change, my name for them is both silly and fitting: eternalisms.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
