Naruo Ryuuji was a fearless killer who eventually got into heroin and, exactly like Ishimatsu Rikuo in Takashi Miike's Graveyard of Honor, eventually leaps to his death from the top of a prison, claiming he'll be back.  I'm assuming this is a reference to real life crazy Yakuza Ishikawa Rikio, whom the original Graveyard of Honor was based on.  It's established that the corpse of the fierce Yakuza Ryuuji is buried in the graveyard beneath a marker with the Japanese characters \"Jingi\" (Honor), and then we are taken to the modern day.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cIP2JLcg1J83Nkjq7Ee0qNVamlV.jpg", "actors": ["Hitoshi Ozawa ()", "Hideo Murota ()", "Osamu Ebara ()", "Shun Kanda ()", "Esaku Shindo ()", "Mia Matsura ()", "Sakae Kimura ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
