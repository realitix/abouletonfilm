It captures the distance between Jir\u00f3n Azangaro, one of the most dangerous streets in Lima, immersed in a deep economic crisis since the 1980s, and the nearby, and apparently impassable, building of the Palace of Justice. Lama selected La Monte Young\u2019s four-pitch musical piece The Second Dream of the High-Tension Line Stepdown Transformer (1962) to accompany the images. This work received the Best Experimental Film/Video Award at the Lima International Film Festival.\" - M\u00f3nica Savir\u00f3n, Museum of the Moving Image", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
