Before he was an auteur du sexy with Wild Orchid and Red Shoe Diaries, Zalman King starred in a number of Seventies underground dramas such as tonight\u2019s film, in which he\u2019s an angry young man in a wintery Colorado resort town, trying his best to avoid the ski-bummer that lies dead ahead if he complies with the sinister wishes of the burg\u2019s local plutocrat. Co-starring Charlotte Rampling, this highly unusual tale is awash in expansive, snow-capped \u2018scope cinematography and a whirlwind of spacey vibes.
