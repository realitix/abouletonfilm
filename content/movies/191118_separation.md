{"tmdb_id": 191118, "title": "Separation", "original_title": "Separation", "slug_title": "separation", "date": "2013-04-15", "genre": ["Thriller"], "score": "5.3/10", "synopsis": "Separation opens with an absolutely innocent shot of a young girl riding a bicycle. It isn\u2019t until later in the film that we learn exactly what we were watching. And that is exactly what Separation is all about. This is a film that masterfully uses sleight of hand like a highly-skilled magician to show us one thing while setting up something completely different. And writer/director Greg White brings it all together in a tense film with an exciting climax that pulls back all the curtains.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4bU5eOcquRAklYKUeFlP9u1l3mk.jpg", "actors": ["Sarah Manninen (Liz)", "Peter Stebbings (Jack)", "Dmitry Chepovetsky (Geoffrey)", "Al Sapienza (Elliot)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "n4DTHK1TJFA"}
