The album includes a mixture of original material by the band and covers of classic folk, rock and country songs, including the band's most famous single, a cover of The Velvet Underground's \"Sweet Jane\", based on the version found on 1969: The Velvet Underground Live, rather than the later studio version from Loaded.[4] Also included is \"Blue Moon Revisited (Song for Elvis)\", which is both a cover and an original, combining a new song by the band with the pop standard \"Blue Moon\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2qZoQH33SyPV5KFEdKVs4NgNPuI.jpg", "actors": ["Alan Anton ()", "Margo Timmins ()", "Michael Timmins ()", "Peter Timmins ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
