The main character of the first journey is the author himself, who, while sitting in his customary caf\u00e9, suddenly realises that he has hallucinations. The psychologist reassures him that all this is merely repression. The symptoms, however, appear again. Soon it turns out that the author has a brain tumour. Professor P\u00f6tzl in Vienna suggests operation right away. The intervention, through which he is awake, is carried out in a Stockholm clinic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dQ8XrNFodamUweIqwAls0o4jB1Q.jpg", "actors": ["Zolt\u00e1n Latinovits (Karinthy Frigyes, az \u00edr\u00f3)", "\u00c9va Ruttkai (Karinthy feles\u00e9ge)", "T\u00f6r\u0151csik Mari (Szonya)", "Samu Bal\u00e1zs (P\u00f6tzl professzor)", "Sinkovits Imre (Cirkuszigazgat\u00f3)", "K\u00e1llai Ferenc (Pszichoanalitikus)", "Mens\u00e1ros L\u00e1szl\u00f3 (Bar\u00e1t a k\u00f6nyvt\u00e1rban)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
