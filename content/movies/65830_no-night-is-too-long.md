Blessed with extraordinary good looks, Tim enjoyed much attention and cared little of broken hearts. At University he was a favored student in a prestigious creative writing course, but a chance meeting, a stolen kiss and a sudden flare of passion sets Tim on a journey of betrayal, heartbreak and murder. In a flashback, he tells his story of cruelty, love and a soul-destroying guilt that offers little chance for redemption.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/81uNqDEDFrM9NmdOigwQIjXNF2w.jpg", "actors": ["Lee Williams (Tim Cornish)", "Marc Warren (Dr Ivo Steadman)", "Mikela J.
