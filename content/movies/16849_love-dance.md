She is cultured and used to the finer things in life, including theater and fine dining. He is gruff on the outside but sweet on the inside - a Sabra; and looking to make his young son a man rather than the wimp his mother is raising. One day, Chen stumbles upon a ballroom dance class for young people and sees Natalie, a stunning Russian young girl he falls in love with immediately. His interest in Natalie leads him to taking ballroom dancing and to ultimately bridging the cultural divide of his own family - through the Cha Cha and the Tango. The teachers are a pair of former Russian world champions who never quite fulfilled their potential, but find themselves battling their demons through the instructions of the kids.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uumbWobg4ipzw3ZoDBGklAQniJ4.jpg", "actors": ["Avi Kushnir (Rami)", "Evgeniya Dodina (Yulia)", "Oksana Korostyshevskaya (Lena)", "Kirill Safonov (Roman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
