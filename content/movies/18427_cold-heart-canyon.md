She's a writer, and she's soon met several men - Marcus, who helps her the day she moves in, neighbors Daniel and Marisa for whom she cooks dinner, and Michael her landlord who cleans her pool weekly. Daniel warns her away from Marcus even as he makes a play for her and invites her to participate in sexual escapades - some enjoyable, some not. Then it becomes clear that Karen's anxiety dream was prescient. Who can Heather trust, and does she figure it out too late?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mw6TR0CAlZDmV5gbXFmM3hhC0pS.jpg", "actors": ["Aubrey Caldwell (Heather)", "Will Lupardus (Daniel)", "Paul Howard (Marcus)", "Lee Anne Davis (Marisa)", "Barbara Suiter (Karen)", "Joshua Coleman (Michael)", "Holly Morgan (Call Girl)", "Andrew C.
