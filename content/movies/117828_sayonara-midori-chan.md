Attracted to her manager there, the shallow but charming Yutaka, she willingly succumbs to his lascivious advances only to discover afterward that he already has a girlfriend by the name of Midori. Even so, Yuko's feelings for Yutaka continue to grow regardless of his aloofness. Before long she finds herself reluctantly cajoled into working as a hostess in a small karaoke bar. Fatalistically accepting his dalliances with flames old and new, she perseveres not so much in hope of a more substantial relationship, but rather out of fear of losing him. There are other men out there waiting for her -- kinder, more considerate and eagerly available. But for Yuko, there is only the non-committal, yet torridly magnetic Yutaka. Why him? Not even Yuko seems to know the answer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sGuqj03fk7O1mvI7JlcSIKbxUdQ.jpg", "actors": ["Mari Hoshino (Yuko)", "Hidetoshi Nishijima (Yutaka)", "Mayuko Iwasa (Maki)", "Sayuri Oyamada ()", "Toshinobu Matsuo (Taro)", "Taigo Fujisawa ()", "Tetsuya Chiba ()", "Taro Suwa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
