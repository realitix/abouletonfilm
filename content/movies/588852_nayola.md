Three generations of women: Lelena (the grandmother), Nayola (the daughter) and Luana (the granddaughter) deeply plagued by civil war. The imagination of an orphan girl reinvents her mother as a heroin on the sheets of a journal, where memories and masks, utopias and cruelties, reality and magic emerge, mesh together and fall apart. A suspended love, a fearless quest on a military landscape, a lacerating regret, an initiatory journey. In the end, a tragic reunion during peacetime, in a country undergoing a true metamorphosis, pregnant with hope.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/suaystPS2S8d10Wwj5EbOWYJu6r.jpg", "actors": ["Ciomara Morais (Rapariga)", "\u00c2ngelo Torres (The Boy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
