Their suspicions are confirmed when Renfrew finds the control stick has been jammed, forcing the plane to fly in one direction until the gas ran out. Mine owner Louise Howard (Louise Stanley) reports that her superintendent is missing. The Mounties find him murdered and that too has been made to look like an accident. A new mail service pilot, Bill Shipley (Warren Hull), arrives. He had gone to training school with Renfrew but had been cashiered for misconduct. The Mounties discover that Raymond (Karl Hackett), who had been working for Louise, really owns the flying line managed by Yuke Cardoe (William Pawley.) They find proof that all the gold from the mine isn't being turned over to Louise, and suspect that Raymond and Yuke are stealing the gold and shipping it to Seattle by plane.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gMRCJgFwNSys19rxpPWHs99IUay.jpg", "actors": ["James Newill (Sergeant Renfrew)", "Louise Stanley (Louise Howard)", "Warren Hull (Bill Shipley)", "William Pawley (Yuke Gradeau)", "Dave O'Brien (Constable Kelly)", "George Humbert (Nick - Cafe Owner)", "Karl Hackett (Raymond - Airline Owner)", "Jack Clifford (Whispering Smith)", "Roy Barcroft (Henchman Lodin)", "Bob Terry (Henchman DeLong)", "Earl Douglas (Henchman Smokie Joe)", "Ernie Adams (Henry)", "Eddie Fetherston (Pilot Rufe George)", "Jack Rutherford (James Benton)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
