They inevitably broaden, as their momentum builds into a celebration of the game itself - its vigour, its humour, its spirit and perhaps above all, its friendships. No-one knows how to celebrate these things better than Max.  Max Boyce holds a unique place in the affections of rugby followers as someone whose love for the game \u2013 and for Welsh rugby in particular, however it happens to be faring - helps define the kind of entertainer he is and the very special world he invites us to enter.  It\u2019s a world audiences have embraced with total delight over three decades of best-selling albums, hit television shows and sell-out live performances. You name it and Max has done it. Now he can add the Sydney Opera House to his list of conquests.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6reAe1w7w7YzSbkSWQkIVh5MCiv.jpg", "actors": ["Max Boyce ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
