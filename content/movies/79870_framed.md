He proposes that the entire collection of priceless paintings should be removed from London and stored in an abandoned slate mine inside a Welsh mountain, as they were during the Second World War. Soon after Quentin is settled in North Wales admittedly more at home in a cave among his paintings than he is with other people he unwittingly sets in motion a series of events that wake up this sleepy, charming town. After mistaking local boy Dylan Hughes for an art history genius, Quentin finds himself in the middle of mayhem.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7spTXq9JDvV8OGPTa3kdMswv4mz.jpg", "actors": ["Trevor Eve (Quentin Lester)", "Eve Myles (Angharad Stannard)", "Robert Pugh (Mr Davis)", "Mark Lewis Jones (Daffyd Hughes)", "Nina Sosanya (Marnie Pope)", "Guy Henry (Reynolds)", "Mari Ann Bull (Minnie Hughes)", "Sam Davies (Dylan Hughes)", "Nicola Reynolds (Bethan Hughes)", "Margaret John (Edith Sellwood)", "Gwenyth Petty (Edna Sellwood)", "Gwyneth Keyworth (Marie Hughes)", "Matthew Aubrey (Tom Ellis)", "James Woolley (National Gallery Director)", "Aneirin Hughes (Petrol Rep)", "Tim Treloar (PC Gary Evans)", "Olwen Medi (Mrs Porty)", "Jodi Bird (Jade Evans)", "Melanie Abbott (Reporter)", "Livia Hughes (London Schoolchild)", "Sian Boudreaux (Florida Terrible Jones)", "Frank Cottrell Boyce (Car Boot Dealer)", "Ruby Lewis (Max Hughes)", "Ella Lewis (Max Hughes)", "Anton Saunders (Gary (uncredited))", "Matthew Rohman (Passer By (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
