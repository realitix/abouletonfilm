One evening in June, two boys, Clarinet and Piano, say goodbye. Clarinet leaves and Piano stays. They are almost eighteen years old. For twelve years, they find themselves at irregular intervals during the return of Clarinet in the city. \"Mont-de-Marsan is the image of a past that has learned to hide but built me \u200b\u200bwhatever I say. For its part, Mont-de-Marsan sees grow and sees go, see return and leave, unalterable guardian of a story, like the statues arranged throughout the streets of the city center. Cinema is also there to take the place of what has not been lived in childhood and adolescence, to finally make possible an incarnation, the figuration of a missing image.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gb1iPUnNHWEWyvxmgEUFqCr4GFa.jpg", "actors": ["Adrien Dantou (Clarinette)", "C\u00e9sar Domboy (Piano)", "Christine Leroy (Cor)", "Elise Lhomeau (Violon)", "Th\u00e9o Ribeton (Basson)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
