It is not a historical documentary, but a collection of stories shot in 1999 while Coan and Rick traveled from southern California to Seattle and around the east coast in search of pools to ride. FRUIT OF THE VINE profiles the people who search for, find, break into, and ultimately glean some use out of these pieces of the American suburban wasteland.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bitsqD7VCQqVfZAMDXVcIXhzelY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
