These elements and more emerge and re-emerge like musical motifs, continuously and meticulously altered through processes like bleaching, staining, and multiple print generation, dramatically extracting the formal particularities of the Kodachrome reversal print.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/govPtmJ0pi95C285V6Bguztc0Fa.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
