Bruce talks about his work with The Dead C, other projects, and life in the Dunedin scene. I made it for school, and did all the shooting myself; except for the live music shots, which I give credit to whoever owns them. I know its long, but I would really love to hear what you think :)\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2A0F5LSEDQd2tHkBNUwax3WJ89p.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
