For years he lived in this cave, without electricity or running water. Today the \u201chome\u201d that he built out of anything and everything \u2013 rocks, trash, sand \u2013 contains countless caves and tunnels, and Nissim insists on continuing to work on it every day. His work never ends. Nissim\u2019s son, eighteen-year-old Moshe, who was born in the cave and will soon join the military, is moving in with him.
