Its libretto was by F. Zell and Richard Gen\u00e9e based on Le Ch\u00e2teau Trompette by Eug\u00e8ne Cormon and Richard Gen\u00e9e. The farcical, romantic story involves several cases of mistaken identity.  The piece premiered in 1883 in Berlin and then Vienna. It became one of Strauss's three most famous stage works and has been seen in New York, London and elsewhere, and has been adapted for film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9lanOrCJHFjNXGDTOne6dXHr0Kt.jpg", "actors": ["Anton De Ridder (Herzog von Urbino)", "Sylvia Geszty (Annina)", "Jon Piso (Caramello)", "Cesare Curzi (Pappacodoa)", "Erich Kunz (Delacqua)", "Trudeliese Schmidt (Barbara)", "Karl Doench (Barbaruccio)", "Kurt Sowinetz (Testaccio)", "Erich Fiedler (Balbi)", "Michael Lenz (Enrico)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
