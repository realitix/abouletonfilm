An alarm clock wakes her in a dorm; she gets ready for work and travels to a large bakery. We see her with friends, chatting and laughing, as well as working. They go out, seven of them jammed in an old Pontiac: bowling, then to an amusement park, then driving around. Car trouble may put her at risk. Is she going to be okay?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ceZuvg7A03pGqEwOagbA2ng19LQ.jpg", "actors": ["Miki Irie (Ako)", "Teruko Hasegawa (Ako's Boyfriend)", "Yoko Matsushita (Ako's Friend)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [203100, 128939, 105581], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
