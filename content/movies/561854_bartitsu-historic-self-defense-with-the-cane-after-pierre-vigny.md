Back in London, he founded a club where he taught the upscale society in self-defense. He combined the most effective martial arts of his time: Canne Vigny, Boxing, Savate and Ju-Jitsu. Barton-Wright became such an early pioneer of mixed martial arts (MMA). He called his self-defense art Bartitsu .
