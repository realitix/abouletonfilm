The staging and mis-en-scene is traditional and very well done. Everyone seems to be enjoying this presentation. Although not to the same standard as today's HD productions, this is still a wonderful way to get to know this delightful opera.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wrPhkjEfqLIsuA9VO2H43ufycgU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
