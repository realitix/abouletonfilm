Danuta knows exactly what she wants and delegates her wishes to those around her. Her German niece Alexandra, the maker of this film, has travelled to Warsaw to take part. Barely has she sat down at the kitchen table when a heated discussion ensues. Be it abortion or migration, it soon dawns on Alexandra that her view of the world could not be more different from that of her right-wing conservative relatives in Poland. Alone in her \u2018liberal\u2019 view Alexandra is mocked as a victim of western propaganda\u2026  Filmmaker Alexandra Wesolowski uses a family gathering as an opportunity to portray her own family and allows us intimate insight into Polish society and the populist national-conservative Europe of today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q1Lr1WEsrnAIpEPhb5mJ10fXUfF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
