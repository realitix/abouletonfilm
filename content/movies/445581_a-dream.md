Mark works as 'an international employee'. One night he meets three local girls in a bar: Besa, her girlfriend Hana, and Shpresa. Mark is attracted to Shpresa's extreme passion, but the romance is soon shattered. Her mood swings from passionate love to hate and death threats in a matter of seconds. For Mark this is hard to handle. He believes Shpresa might suffer from borderline personality disorder. As he wants to confront her, she starts pushing him away. Hana and Besa's relationship is also in danger, but for a completely different reason: Hana is afraid of the social stigma that love between two girls carries in the deeply conservative and patriarchal Kosovo.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bOXMmr1jzuazKtgnEDtDb0BD69J.jpg", "actors": ["Aude Le Pape (Shpresa)", "Aleksandar Rajakovi\u0107 (Mark)", "May-Linda Kosumovic (Hana)", "Alketa Sylay (Besa)", "Luan Jaha ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
