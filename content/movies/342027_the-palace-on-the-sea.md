A man (favourite actor Wang Shin-hong) meets a woman (standard actor Wu Ke-xi) on a moored ship, a sort of floating palace decorated like a Buddhist temple. The woman or her spirit struggles with her memories and the man takes on the form of a Buddhist monk in his next life. Complex and yet simple. The man, the woman and the camera move gracefully 'dancing' through the space. Only the thought of escape.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r357gvqwKJlljx5DyN05nEjlOB8.jpg", "actors": ["Wu Ke-Xi ()", "Wang Shin-Hong ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
