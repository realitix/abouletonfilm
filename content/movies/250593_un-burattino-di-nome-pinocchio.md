During production, Carlo Collodis grandchildren Mario and Antonio Lorenzini were consulted. The subtle movements made by fidgeting children whilst speaking or under scrutiny were incorporated into Pinocchios movements, particularly when he lies to the Fairy with the Turquoise Hair over the fate of his gold coins. For the design of the Fairy, Italian portrayals of the Blessed Virgin Mary in art were used as starting points.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nUWBJgn2gNGYUxPtqL7pZ4DqAIg.jpg", "actors": ["Roberta Paladini (Pinocchio)", "Roberto Bertea (Geppetto)", "Lauro Gazzolo (Grillo Parlante)", "Vittoria Febbi (Fata Turchina)", "Sergio Tedesco (Volpe, Arlecchino)", "Manlio De Angelis (Gatto)", "Flaminia Jandolo (Lucignolo)", "Michele Gammino (Mangiafuoco)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "3a3CMvAR1W8"}
