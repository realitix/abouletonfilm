The inner city landscape of Prague, its beautifully integrated accretion of structures, 1000 years history repressed but un-bombed, is viewed through the rhomboidal electricity-catchers on the tops of its moving trams. Trams define the rhythm of the city, &amp; so their looped noises define the rhythm of this film. As contrapuntal fixed point, the Zizkov Tower--built by the Soviets for signal-jamming broadcasts from the West &amp; looking like an about-to-launch ICBM--is accompanied by actual Cold War shortwave spy broadcasts.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zvG142vM2yDc171wEOl5vEFidMf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
