A single stationary camera was mounted inside the center of a large rotating platform. As the platform rotated around the camera, a scene would come into view of the camera. The wheel would stop and a sketch would play out in the scene, which was often framed by some piece of appropriate artwork or prop (for the purposes of forced perspective). At the end of the scene, the wheel would rotate, carrying one scene out of the camera's view and bringing another in, and a new sketch would begin in the new scene. Some scenes were self-contained on the platform, while others were open to the studio beyond the platform (and additional action would take place in the background).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rXrHtYURA31h4VcCH1K4PbDezEO.jpg", "actors": ["Joel Hodgson (Himself)", "David Cross (Various)", "Andy Kindler (Various)", "Fred Stoller (Various)", "Dave Allen (Various)", "Doug Benson (Various)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
