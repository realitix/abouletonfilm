But his happiness is short-lived. Marina only wants Gideon to pretend to be her boyfriend so she can investigate a s\u00e9ance as an undercover reporter. It turns out that Gideon and Marina aren\u2019t the only ones with something to hide. Ramona, the not-so-typical medium, suspects there are hidden cameras and her creepy sidekick Errol keeps disappearing when the lights go out. Something\u2019s unsettling about Marina\u2019s editor, Trevor, and his timid wife, Helen. A dead woman\u2019s daughter, Lily, is an unbalanced mess, and her boyfriend, David, is less of a rock and more of a stoner. When the s\u00e9ance turns south, a mournful spirit will ensure all of their buried secrets are brought to light.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9QWwoeqjR5k4F03XlkkOxcByevs.jpg", "actors": ["Jun Naito (Gideon)", "Marian Brock (Lily)", "Marina Franklin (Marina)", "Mina Sands (Ramona)", "Mickey Ryan (Trevor)", "Mary Micari (Helen)", "Paul Herbig (David)", "Joseph Francini (Erroll)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
