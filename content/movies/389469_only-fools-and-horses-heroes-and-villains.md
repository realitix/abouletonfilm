After giving Rodney a bracelet for his birthday inscribed 'Rooney', Del drives Rodney to a fancy dress party where they are dressed as Batman and Robin. However the Reliant Robin breaks down and, as the brothers are running through the fog in costume, they scare off a gang of muggers about to rob a female councilor. At the party they are the only guests in costume because the birthday boy has actually died and the party is now a wake. But there is good news next day when Del catches one of the muggers as he is about to rob an old lady and knocks him unconscious. He gets a medal AND his council grant as a reward for helping the female councilor. Good news for Rodney too as Cassandra announces that she is pregnant.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4mQJO3dEc6G9APUDbmo8eQtEdJn.jpg", "actors": ["David Jason (Derek 'Del Boy' Trotter)", "Nicholas Lyndhurst (Rodney Trotter)", "Buster Merryfield (Uncle Albert)", "Tessa Peake-Jones (Raquel Turner)", "Gwyneth Strong (Cassandra Trotter)", "John Challis (Boycie)", "Roger Lloyd Pack (Trigger)", "Paul Barber (Denzil)", "Kenneth MacDonald (Mike Fisher)", "Douglas Hodge (Adult Damien Trotter)", "Angela Bruce (Councillor Murray)", "Roy Heather (Sid)", "Steve Weston (Kenny)", "Scott Marshall (Gary)", "Dan Clark (Scott)", "Fuman Dar (Kevin)", "Sheree Murphy (Dawn)", "Bay White (Old Lady)", "Robin Meredith (Mayor)", "Richard Hicks (Photographer)", "Jamie Smith (Damien Trotter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
