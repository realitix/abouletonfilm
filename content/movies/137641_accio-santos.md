The first is made up of a couple of fixed shots of the pianist, Carles Santos, playing the Prelude Op.45 in C sharp minor by Frederick Chopin. The second segment shows him listening to this own recording from a loudspeaker until he dons the headphones, therefore letting silence take over the film and consequently also over the audience in the movie theatre. The lenght of the silent shot is for the duration of the prelude.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eVuDc2NCKdWuBi7DIkO8WiAeWkl.jpg", "actors": ["Carles Santos ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
