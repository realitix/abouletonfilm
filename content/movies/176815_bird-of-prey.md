His only company is Luisa, the cleaning lady, with whom he plays cat and mouse.  To escape the sleep of reason \u2013 which creates monsters -, Hugo exercises his lyrical vein by writing, with his friend Manuel, songs about their neighbourhood.  The quiet dilettantism of our protagonist is shaken by Catarina, a young and beautiful translator who\u2019s starting her professional life as a freelancer.  Hugo is hooked and wavers. High above, a kestrel falcon hovers.  It\u2019s not the only bird of prey that can do it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bp0Gz7ebCqkLn7FtbmnbC3UvLqD.jpg", "actors": ["Hugo Leit\u00e3o (Hugo)", "M\u00e1rcia Breia (Lu\u00edsa)", "Lia Ferreira (Catarina)", "Manuel Mesquita (Manuel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "at0LaUzwqtI"}
