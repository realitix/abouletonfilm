She flashes back and remembers her coming-of-age. Her recollections are sometimes less than sweet, particularly those of her troubled and alcoholic step-father. Her memories of Robin, her first-love, are much happier and she also recalls her colorful Aunt Starr -- who's visit is fun but also detrimental to her family's health. The setting of 1950s Las Vegas' bomb testing is increasingly significant to the development of the story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dpt2v32ZBe6QYd9UaHyph1HFhXe.jpg", "actors": ["Annabeth Gish (Rose Chismore)", "Jon Voight (Jack Chismore)", "JoBeth Williams (Lily Chismore)", "Ellen Barkin (Aunt Starr)", "Jay Underwood (Robin)", "Allen Garfield (Mr. Mosol)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [79888, 84655, 49314, 55819], "youtube_key": "7ebhPCjzmWk"}
