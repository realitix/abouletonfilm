The heat of August in Paris brings forth memories and at the same time the adult Morder is involved in a love affair. There are no scenes from Ecuador here, and none of the images in the film are used to carry the narration; instead they vaguely illustrate what Morder happens to be saying at the moment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tK8QG70zFHY3wUAUKAVn2cfj9Sr.jpg", "actors": ["Joseph Morder (Narrator / Himself)", "Fran\u00e7oise Michaud ()", "Vincent Tol\u00e9dano ()", "Nicole Tuffeli ()", "Yvette Chalom ()", "Paul Fogel ()", "Dani\u00e8le-Eilse Chalom-Fogel ()", "Philippe Fano ()", "Juan Loyola ()", "Yves Rollin ()", "Vivien Marchal ()", "Elissa Marchal ()", "Sylvain Marchal ()", "G\u00e9rard Fridman ()", "St\u00e9phanie Bri\u00e8re ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
