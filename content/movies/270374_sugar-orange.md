Together, they are two ten-year-old boys who are inseparable. More than just playmates, they share a unique bond which seems predestined to last a lifetime. Until, that is, powerful emotions come to the fore and a misunderstanding leads to a rift which tears both them and their world apart. Twenty years later, Lukas is still terrified of being abandoned. He survives by forming loose relationships which don't threaten him. Then one day he meets Lena who turns his feelings upside down and awakens his inner child, the one still searching for unconditional friendship. While there is never a guarantee of security, there is a bond of trust, and through Lena, Lukas again makes contact with Clemens. After years of silence, they are finally able to exorcise their ghosts in an explosion of emotion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ky5EIjSMwvrJhfoCSew2dHkb1TL.jpg", "actors": ["Sabine Timoteo (Lena)", "Lucas Gregorowicz (Leo)", "Hyun Wanner (Orange)", "Kai Michael M\u00fcller (Sugar)", "Bruno Cathomas (Frank)", "Barnaby Metschurat (Basketballspieler)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
