Writes Jordan, \"I must emphasize that I do not know the exact significance of any of the symbols in the film any more than I know the meaning of my dreams... I hope that the symbols and the episodes set off poetic associations in the viewer. I mean them to be entirely open to the viewer's own interpretation.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aBNoSGHHtpStJoH3rt5QSHzRUDA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
