Mili and Noam are high-school students who intend to celebrate their six-month anniversary by losing their virginity. What begins as an innocent pedal boat ride full of raging hormones, becomes a struggle against monstrous cats out for blood. This self-parodying low, low budget, independently produced feature is filled with surprises as well as hilarious oddball charm.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mzN6jYueUnc5Pkw3XoY4t5j5CPJ.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Moshonov (Noam)", "Dana Frider (Milly)", "Shmuel Vilozni (The Admiral)", "Michael Hanegbi (Dov Dov)", "Gidi Gov ()", "Shmuel Wolf ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
