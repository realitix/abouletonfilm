This isn't the first time the company has made something of a splash with the bel canto repertory. Some will remember their CD release, a few years back, of Bellini's Norma, also featuring Bartoli. That set got very mixed reviews, and those who hated that will probably hate this too, no doubt before they even watch it. But for those not initiated in the trench warfare that music loving often attracts, this disc will be most welcome. The world class cast, led by Cecilia Bartoli and tenor John Osborn, are (mostly) young, committed and talented. They deliver, here, an intense performance that makes a very strong case for this neglected opera.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ywBso7OPXfVN9igitKbEld2Xgtl.jpg", "actors": ["John Osborn (Otello)", "Cecilia Bartoli (Desdemona)", "Edgardo Rocha (Jago)", "Liliana Nikiteanu (Emilia)", "Javier Camarena (Rodrigo)", "Peter K\u00e1lm\u00e1n (Elmiro)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
