Assumed to be a man because of the name, Freddy creates a sensation appearing at a dance in the newest creation from Paris, and later incurs the ire of all when she accidentally causes a stampede. Ranch foreman Bruce Elwood (Arnold Gray) eventually wins the heart of the leading lady when he rescues Freddy from a villainous cattle rustler. A year after this light comedy, Dean began to wind down her career, and played a foil to Laurel and Hardy in Slipping Wives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2lyxC73Y2uCzjL6qI21EotfYu9m.jpg", "actors": ["Priscilla Dean ('Freddie' Hayden)", "Arnold Gray (Bruce Elwood)", "Majel Coleman (Muriel Styles)", "Walter Long (Bad Willie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
