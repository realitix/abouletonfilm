The Canadian songstress broke out in 1993 wit her third album, Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, inspired by her experience working on a documentary about poverty and child prostitution. Then came Mirrorball, which gave rise to enchanting songs like \"Building a Mystery\" and \"I Will Remember You.\" And we\"ve got them right here in rock's most intimate setting, so sit back, relax, and get ready to go one-on-one with the artists you love \" and the songs you only thought you knew.
