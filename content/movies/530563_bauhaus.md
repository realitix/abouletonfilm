The life of 20-year-old Lotte Brendel seems to be predetermined. Her father sees her as a future wife and mother on the side of a man who is to take over the parental carpentry business. But the idiosyncratic Lotte joins a group of young artists against the will of her family, applies at the Bauhaus and is accepted. The Weimar Bauhaus, under the direction of the visionary Walter Gropius, aspires not only to combine arts and crafts, but also to find the place for the \"New Man\". In the student Paul Seligmann Lotte finds a supporter and her great love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/japnrkBj6BcqVtedVim2UtyFSq8.jpg", "actors": ["Alicia von Rittberg (Lotte Brendel)", "Christoph Letkowski (Johannes Itten)", "Ulrich Brandhoff (Juppi Albers)", "Nina Gummich (Friedl Dicker)", "Tom Mikulla (Herr Ludwig)", "Julia Riedler (D\u00f6rte Helm)", "Noah Saavedra (Paul Seligmann)", "J\u00f6rg Hartmann (Walter Gropius)", "Marie Hacke (Anni Fleischmann)", "Torsten Ranft (Gustav Brendel)", "Claudia Geisler (Alma Brendel)", "Lina Hoppe (Irm Brendel)", "Julia-Maria K\u00f6hler (Frau Ludwig)", "Petra Bu\u010dkov\u00e1 (Die Frau)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
