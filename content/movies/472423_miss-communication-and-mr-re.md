Moten and Tsang left each other voicemail messages every day over a two-week period, never actually making contact, but often riffing off of the other\u2019s previous message. The recordings of these messages serve as voiceover for footage of the faces of Moten and Tsang looking directly at the camera with deadpan expressions.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Fred Moten (Himself)", "Wu Tsang (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
