This new machine seems like a sure-fire hit, which has attracted the attention of Richards' less-than-scrupulous assistant Martin, who wants to steal the new invention and sell it himself. In order to make it easier for Martin to do just that, he uses the machine to create a duplicate of Richards, which will do his evil bidding. The professor's son, Jack, and wife, Barbara, learn about Martin's underhanded doings, and Barbara uses another one of her husband's gimmicks to get revenge against Martin -- she turns herself invisible.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hqCXuDkH4ZkOAHFYXpm3zwawEU0.jpg", "actors": ["Hannes Jaenicke (Dr. John Richards)", "Mary Elizabeth McGlynn (Barbara Richards)", "Harrison Myers (Jackie Richards)", "Steve Scionti (Dr. Carl McGavin)", "Robert Quarry (Robert Secord)", "Robert Donavan (Victor Alexander)", "Ariauna Albright (Angie Cornell)", "Arthur Roberts (Mr. Price)", "Calista Carradine (Miss Caine)", "Kimberly A.
