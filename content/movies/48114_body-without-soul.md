After the boys talk about how they got in the game, the camera follows them to the home of Pavel Rousek. Under the name Hans Miller, he makes gay porno videos, primarily for German distribution. Intercut with a movie shoot chez Rousek is an interview that follows him to his day job at a morgue, where he performs an autopsy as he talks about his work. The sex is without protection; the boys are without family. They talk about their bodies and souls, money, their sexual orientation, AIDS, their dreams, and death.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nNSih8pW2ltc2c0zY5eJpqc2FXX.jpg", "actors": ["Pavel Rousek (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [43940, 149349, 327175], "youtube_key": "vvjNDKiR3dU"}
