Forcing myself to watch it further, it actually improved, and considerably.\r\n\r\nThe plot of this basically is a janitor in a hospital has a date with a girl in the morgue. She's dead of course and died of radiation exposure resulting in him getting some super-STD, turning into a zombie, seeking out vaginal blood, and infecting several others. Along comes a group of high schoolers on their way to a beach weekend and pulling over at a roadside hotel in the town to stay over the night. But they didn't plan on the horny dead making an appearance.\r\n\r\nAn experiment in excessive gross-out this movie is, but as disgusting as it is, it is actually well scripted, well lit for a nighttime movie and briskly paced. It is funny, though some of that humor is off-color and offensive.\r\n\r\nI give it a 6/10, but do bring your own vomit bag, or more preferably a bucket.\r\n\r\n**Toxic Fletch**"}], "recommandations_id": [214464, 44224, 325186, 297472]}
