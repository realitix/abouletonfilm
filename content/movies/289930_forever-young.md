Each generation faces its own unique set of challenges. Up against corporate corruption, the trials and tribulations of the cultural revolution, and one's duty to nation in time of war, they are faced with choosing their individual paths through history. But as the challenges and turmoil of each generation may differ as time changes, what was learned in the past cannot help but effect the choices that are made in the future as it is passed down from generation to generation. And that is the universal message that being true to yourself is precious. It is the source of strength that empowers one to become the person they want to be, to march forward as far as their hearts desire, into the future.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/juvPPgd1iZPJlxrRvWABgUPxNY3.jpg", "actors": ["Zhang Ziyi (Wang Minjia)", "Huang Xiaoming (Chen Peng)", "Leehom Wang (Shen Guangyao)", "Chang Chen (Zhang Guoguo)", "Chen Chusheng (Wu Linglan)", "Zu Feng ()", "Zheng Tie ()", "Michelle Yim ()", "Russell Wong ()", "Han Tongsheng ()", "Lin Mei-Shiu ()", "Wu Jinyan ()", "Paul Philip Clark ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [486898, 457251, 460555], "youtube_key": "9WqplNR9Rp8"}
