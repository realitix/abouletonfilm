Not just an eye-opener, but a game-changer. Richard Williams demanded nothing less, investing nearly three decades into his movie masterpiece. From as early as 1964 he ploughed most of the profits right back into his pet project, a feature inspired by the Arabian Nights and provisionally known as Mullah Nasruddin. He assembled a team of inspired young artists\u2014and brought in the best Hollywood craftsmen to teach them\u2014and devised what would be the most elaborate, kaleidoscopic, mind-boggling visual sequences ever committed to celluloid. Years passed. Potential financiers came and went. Work continued. But it was only after Roger Rabbit that Williams had a studio budget to corroborate the munificence of his imagination.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rGQoBcaPnqUgxFInzrEEq9dfG10.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Williams (Himself)", "Omar Ali-Shah (Himself)", "Charles Fleischer (Himself)", "Robert Zemeckis (Himself)", "Robin Williams (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Uv33FDnRkn0"}
