Burke decides to ask Higgins to close his business on Sunday, but Higgins only concern is to find a baritone to sing in the saloon's quartet, and has his henchies toss Ted out into the street. Ted decides to fight fire with fire, so he gathers up the down-and-out vaudeville act of Chase &amp; Chase (who don't take long to show why they are down and out) and knife-thrower Steve Clemente, and a dozen or so western musicians from Gower Gulch as the before-the-sermon at his tabernacle. Higgins sends his rowdies over to bust up the Sunday morning competition.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4Agghc1okQSBbrY6u3v8Mllbzls.jpg", "actors": ["Dick Foran (Parson Ted Burke)", "Linda Perry (Mary Lou)", "Jane Wyman (Butte Soule)", "Edmund Cobb (Jack Higgins)", "Glenn Strange (Master of Ceremonies)", "Fritz Hubert (Mr. Chase)", "Jean Hubert (Mrs. Chase)", "Steve Clemente (Steve Clemente - Knife Thrower)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
