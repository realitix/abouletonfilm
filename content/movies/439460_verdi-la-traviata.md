It also has some flaws: strangely variable volume level of the recorded sound sometimes coming on so loud as to make one reach for the volume control, and the uneven performance of the Violetta, Eva Mei who, for all her merits, gives a dramatically effective performance marred by occasional difficulties with vocal production. Still, overall I felt this was a moving production, one that I would recommend, although perhaps not as an only DVD of one of Verdi's most popular operas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vbKZ3wn93rkfRkSQlJsXWsJoxyI.jpg", "actors": ["Eva Mei (Violetta)", "Piotr Beczala (Alfredo)", "Thomas Hampson (Germont)", "Katharina Peetz (Flora)", "Miroslav Christoff (Gastone)", "Valeriy Murga (Baron Douphol)", "Ir\u00e8ne Friedli (Annina)", "Giuseppe Scorsin (Doctor Grenvil)", "Richard Mayr (Marqu\u00e9s D'Obigny)", "Franz Welser-M\u00f6st (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
