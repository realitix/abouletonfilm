That film was extraordinary then for having multiple scenes and a semblance of a narrative; additionally, the use of dissolves as transitions in it influenced other filmmakers for years to do the same. M\u00e9li\u00e8s was the cinema world's preeminent leader then. By 1912, however, that was no longer the case; frankly, as evidenced by this feature, his style had become dated. Moreover, M\u00e9li\u00e8s had begun to adopt techniques from other filmmakers, such as direct cuts instead of dissolves, and there's even a match on action shot during the slipper trying-on scene.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1JBIx3Rv9PxiHgOd7RDlOOUiPXA.jpg", "actors": ["Louise Lagrange ()", "Jacques Feyder ()", "Marthe Vinot ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [119974, 144450, 120013, 119979], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
