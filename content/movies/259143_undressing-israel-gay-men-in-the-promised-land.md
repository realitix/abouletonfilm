But there is much more to the Jewish state then missiles and prayers. In his debut as a documentary filmmaker, adult-film entrepreneur and political columnist Michael Lucas examines a side of Israel that is too often overlooked: its thriving gay community. Undressing Israel features interviews with a diverse range of local men, including a gay member of Israel's parliament, a trainer who served openly in the army, a young Arab-Israeli journalist, and a pair of dads raising their kids. Lucas also visits Tel Aviv's vibrant nightlife scene-and a same-sex wedding-in this guided tour to a country that emerged as a pioneer for gay integration and equality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wh9Tini2psk1Vcsmdkw2rhsgDZe.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
