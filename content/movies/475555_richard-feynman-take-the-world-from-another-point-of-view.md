The resulting film, Take the World From Another Point of View, was broadcast in America as part of the PBS Nova series. The documentary features a fascinating interview, but what sets it apart from other films on Feynman is the inclusion of a lively conversation he had with the eminent British astrophysicist Fred Hoyle.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pMuxpwrzK3TdGUpK3Nw0RrrhIqj.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Feynman (Himself)", "Fred Hoyle (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
