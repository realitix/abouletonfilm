On the first day of his vacation to visit friends, Melpomenus somehow stays and stays until, on the last day of his holiday, he finally departs in an unexpected way. Based on the Stephen Leacock short story, the film is set to toe-tapping ragtime music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qP89qRZZvHasSOcQf89mYfXzvND.jpg", "actors": ["Mavor Moore (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
