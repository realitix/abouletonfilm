In this live performance of Giuseppe Verdi's opera, Violetta, a courtesan much wooed by Parisian society, organises a grand party that is attended, amongst others, by the young Alfredo Germont. He confesses his feelings to Violetta, who is already suffering from consumption. She vacillates between genuine affection and a realistic assessment of her situation as a \"fallen woman\", which precludes any lasting relationship with a man.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sq634kMqtkOeXlpIkQ0kP7o0u3A.jpg", "actors": ["Angela Gheorghiu (Violetta Valery)", "Ram\u00f3n Vargas (Alfredo Germont)", "Roberto Frontali (Giorgio Germont)", "Natascha Petrinsky (Flora Bervoix)", "Tiziana Tramonti (Annina)", "Enrico Cossutta (Gastone)", "Alessandro Paliaga (Barone Douphol)", "Piero Terranova (Marchese d'Obigny)", "Luigi Rocchetti (Dottor Grenvil)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
