This performance featured the cast of the 1960 original, with Nadia Nerina in a role that Ashton created with her in mind. Nerina's \"joyous, soaring skill, which is Lise's signature (Financial Times) and David Blair's technical and interpretative genius in the role of Colas are perfectly offset by Stanley Holden's hilarious travesti turn as Widow Simone, and Alexander Grant, who brings pathos and humour to the character of Alain.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q4f1IJouNQYX9nSBkpwA3i6eWMQ.jpg", "actors": ["Nadia Nerina ()", "David Blair ()", "Stanley Holden ()", "Leslie Edwards ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
