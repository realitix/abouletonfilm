It is the third film of a trilogy by Spheeris depicting life in Los Angeles at various points in time. The first film dealt with the punk rock scene during 1980-1981. The second film covers the Los Angeles heavy metal movement of 1986-1988. The film involves hardcore street punks called \"gutter punks\" who take the anti-establishment message with extreme seriousness, and tune out society completely. Spheeris talks to homeless teenagers living on the street or squatting in abandoned buildings in Los Angeles, as well as an unstable mother, Los Angeles Police Department officer Gary Fredo, and a paralyzed youth living on a disability.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4kpkYrhXmIfoFnnKs28oFwx1m67.jpg", "actors": ["Rick Wilder (himself)", "Flea (himself)", "Stephen Chambers (himself)", "Gary Fredo (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [21137, 54642, 26803, 36746], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
