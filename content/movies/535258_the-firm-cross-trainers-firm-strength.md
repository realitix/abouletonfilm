PHA sequencing also strengthens the heart by repeatedly making it pump blood back and forth between distant muscle groups. When used on alternate days they sculpt your body by preventing muscles from adapting to predictable exercise sequences, and maximize aerobic endurance and fat burning.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yh6aAWLs3t7ILxUrXuk79HAnUGW.jpg", "actors": ["Pam Cauthen (Master Instructor)", "Anne Bailes ()", "Kelsie Daniels ()", "Allie Strickland ()", "Patti Graves ()", "Juli Harris ()", "Teri Rouse ()", "Narcisa C.
