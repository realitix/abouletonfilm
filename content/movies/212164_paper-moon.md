Their innocent and young love eventually evolves into an infinite regret and a poignant love story. Many years later, suppressing his feelings of guilt, Tian Song expresses his painful longing for Shi Qin through the making of (WAU) kites, until that fateful meeting with Gao Man Hua (Chrissie Chau)\u2026.  In search of Gao Shi Qin\u2019s first love, Gao Man Hua travels all the way to Kelantan to learn about the man who has wounded her mother. The appearance of Man Hua evoked apprehension in the quiet and reserved Tian Song, bringing back yesterday\u2019s memories. Tian Song is uneasy about Man Hua\u2019s constant clinging, but at the same time, he finds himself attracted to her because she carries an uncanny resemblance to her mother, Gao Shi Qin, his teenage sweetheart.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yPbsnU50Nah6GuIjdrGaHf2tfdF.jpg", "actors": ["Tedd Chan ()", "Chrissie Chau ()", "Gordan Lam ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "5DMaI93ODTM"}
