Paco Sanchez and Dede Gallice are childhood friends who share a passion for karate. When forced to face Dede in a decisive match, Paco refuses to fight his best friend. Dede becomes the champion by default, but he cannot get over the bitterness of this inglorious victory. Paco moves on with his life. Unjustly accused of a robbery and chased by his employer, Dede unwillingly drags his wife Claire and Paco into a frantic nocturnal escape through Paris. Emotions culminate during an apocalyptic game where imagination and reality blend. The film tries to reflect certain social questions of our time using common images.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lrbtVUJXkW7fNSpuYCVieJCiyDm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
