The program argues that because of the island's key location - sandwiched, as it is, in-between Southern Europe and Northern Africa - it inevitably impeded Axis and Allied reinforcement deliveries time and again. As a result, the Maltese people found themselves caught in the middle of a crossfire when they had virtually nothing to do with the war itself, and suffered immensely for their geographic placement. In telling this seldom-heard story, the program draws on first-person interviews, CGI animations, and dramatic recreations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cbIkKUi0Omr42DwFt3boTW9oIHX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "JXS__98tszs"}
