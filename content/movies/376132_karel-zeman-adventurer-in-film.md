It reveals the inspiration sources of his work and looks into the kitchen of the film tricks pioneer. As an absolute solitaire in his field, he created his own world based purely on his imagination. He was a complete autodidact and is therefore not easily classifiable into any film wave or direction. This extremely hardworking, resourceful man and a perfectionist, yet always preserving the ability to see the world from a child's perspective is without any doubt one of the most successful and celebrated Czech filmmakers in the world. Thanks to their inner poetry and sincerity, his films do not age.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1P2EMckDZqnCEL3HUivJmMOgn6w.jpg", "actors": ["Tim Burton (Himself)", "Tony Dalton (Himself)", "Kamil Fila (Himself)", "Terry Gilliam (Himself)", "Petr Herrmann (Himself)", "Zden\u011bk Hust\u00e1k (Himself)", "Karel Hutecka (Himself)", "Zdenek Krupa (Himself)", "Josef Luk\u00e1\u0161 (Himself)", "Boris Masn\u00edk (Himself)", "Kosei Ono (Himself)", "Michal Posp\u00ed\u0161il (Himself)", "Valentina Thielov\u00e1 (Herself)", "Em\u00edlia V\u00e1\u0161\u00e1ryov\u00e1 (Herself)", "Magda V\u00e1\u0161\u00e1ryov\u00e1  (Herself)", "Paul Wells (Himself)", "Karel Zeman (Himself)", "Ludmila Zeman (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
