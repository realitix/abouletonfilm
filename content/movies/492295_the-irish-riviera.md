Made by the Irish Tourist Association, the film briefly visits Cork City showing that from the busy shopping centre of Patrick\u2019s Street, to the Bell tower of Shandon, Cork is an eclectic, vibrant city. It then lingers at the remote outposts of Mizen Head, Garnish, and Dunquin, as the province of Munster is further explored. The viewer discovers the variety of cultural influences the Spanish Armada had on the south of the country, and learns that only a few miles off the shore of Kinsale, Lusitania \u2013 the ocean liner destroyed by a German submarine in World War1 \u2013 sank 20 years prior to this film being made.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
