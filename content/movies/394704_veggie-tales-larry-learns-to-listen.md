When his friends do their best to tell him, Larry refuses to listen! What happens? His game goes KERPOW! That's when Larry learns a valuable lesson (through song!) in listening as his friends come to the rescue.  Kids will discover, right along with Larry, that God gave friends and family to help us through each day so when we listen we don t miss what others have to say!  Also includes the classic stories of Pistachio and Josh &amp; the Big Wall!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sjH1E7YLCZdEikx5pGbNHKCmPTy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
