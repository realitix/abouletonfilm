In 1988, thousands of activists hold the Food and Drug Administration under siege, demanding speedier drug approval. In 1990 AIDS activists converge on the National Institute of Health, calling for a more equitable clinical trial system and expanded research into new drugs and treatment. Voices From the Front, the first feature-length documentary on AIDS activism in America, makes clear the emotional and political effects of community activism using the voices of those directly engaged. It is a powerful distillation of pictures and words from events organized to change public consciousness, expose the failure of the health care systems, and challenge government inaction and neglect concerning AIDS.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cu5HZa1eScBSogA3IAoTEaRonla.jpg", "actors": ["Vito Russo (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
