The French-born, New York\u2013based artist has spent the majority of her artistic career creating work that deals with women\u2019s bodies and female fertility. A recent breast cancer diagnosis led Nourry to create Serendipity\u2014now in the form of a stunning first-person documentary\u2014which captures the subsequent evolution of her body, her work, her soul, and her mind. This impassioned, beautiful film embodies the artist\u2019s belief that everything is connected, coincidence is an illusion, and \u201cthe essentials to life really are health, love, and art.\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sSOKHB9Ji7ZxPQuNTQlYVnbTRJH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
