Going beyond mere shots of skin, the film strives to honestly capture its subjects through in-depth interviews that discuss how each woman got started in the business and how she thinks of herself when it comes to her chosen profession.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/byFbuIM4Q9QjSRaoRQbOrQyDlgV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
