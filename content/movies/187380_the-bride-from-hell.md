But Yunpeng chances into something far more dangerous! He accidentally happens upon the comely Anu naked in bed, and to make up for his rudeness he has to marry her. Because of her beauty, the request is not too difficult to fulfill...until she is introduced to his aunts and uncles, who notice her ghastly green glow and deduce that she's a spirit from the netherworld.
