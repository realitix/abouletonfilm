His rope companion sounds the alarm. And, from the other side of the world, the biggest rescue attempt in the history of the Himalayas gets underway. For four days a dozen men including some of the best mountaineers in the world, from ten countries, set out to try to rescue their stricken comrade.  Even beyond his peaks I\u00f1aki is an exceptional man. As exceptional as the rescue attempt itself and the men who risked their lives to save him. Exceptional because their one driving rule is to live.  To live in the only way possible: with pure intensity and honesty.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tP2JDpfR2sZi4KXLLPwUePXe5CP.jpg", "actors": ["I\u00f1aki Ochoa de Olza (I\u00f1aki)", "Denis Urubko (Denis)", "Ueli Steck (Ueli)", "Alexei Bolotov (Alexei)", "Nancy Morin (Nancy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "yseF20xI01U"}
