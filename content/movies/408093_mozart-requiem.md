He conducts with vigor, strength, and total musical solidity. I believe Bohm to be a better Mozart conductor than Herbert von Karajan (1908-1989) although Karajan is more famous and has had more recordings released in the US than Bohm. Karajan also recorded Mozart's \"Requiem\" at least three times for DG during the stereo era, the final one in DDD sound.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pOwchnaRLEAk4ky8wEE2ENLy9fq.jpg", "actors": ["Karl B\u00f6hm (Conductor)", "Gundula Janowitz (Soprano)", "Peter Schreier (Tenor)", "Christa Ludwig (Mezzo)", "Walter Berry (Bass)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
