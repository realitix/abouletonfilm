BalikBayan, which means \u201creturnee\u201d in Filipino, is partly about the homecoming of the historical figure Enrique of Malacca, a Malay who Tahimik first played and brought to the screen in 1979. As the slave of the 16th-century Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan he circumnavigated the Earth, before returning home as a free man. Old footage of Enrique, played by the young Tahimik, is mixed with the fictional story of a mysterious old man, played by the present-day Tahimik, and documentary footage of a contemporary artist community in Baguio, in northern Philippines. In this version, Redux VI, Tahimik continues his quest to reconsider the Philippines\u2019 colonial legacy. Shot on 16mm (1979\u20131980s) and video (1990s\u20132017).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ucIZJXxz7ZYD5FpxonZvYUtVNMJ.jpg", "actors": ["Kidlat Tahimik ()", "George Steinberg ()", "Kawayan de Guia ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
