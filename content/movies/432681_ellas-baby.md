Tijan Marei plays the teenage girl whose \"first time\" messes up the already fragile family structure. In the role of her single father, who is planning to make a new offspring with his new girlfriend - played by Katharina Sch\u00fcttler - Benno F\u00fcrmann can be seen. Director David Dietl tells the story in a humorous way, without losing sight of the seriousness of the topic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2w0OOcx1srOSCqV5bUQ5518f3mC.jpg", "actors": ["Katharina Sch\u00fcttler (Ariane)", "Benno F\u00fcrmann (Roman)", "Olli Schulz (Lehrer)", "Peter Franke (Karl)", "Tijan Marei (Ella)", "Milena Drei\u00dfig (Susanne)", "J\u00fcrg Pl\u00fcss (Thomas)", "Stephan Grossmann (Pr\u00fcfer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
