It tells the tale of a group of artists and a scientist who decide to retire to a house immersed in the beauty of the Abruzzo National Park, an Italian national reserve. It plays with the language of television and transforms it into pure cinema.  Artists, researchers and intellectuals, instead of soubrettes, the ignorant and TV stars!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xNTdycjGMSnd0tyg71fZ6MW7LkT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
