City planners designed the urban environment around the idea of mobility, and the social and work life of the population followed. The car became a necessity rather than a  luxury; our environment demanded that we drive. So what does it mean, living in a car-based society, to make a conscious choice not to drive? In this new film, a number of Winnipeggers speak of this choice and the effect it has had on their lives. From mothers with young children to social activists, from artists to human rights workers, they share their reasons for choosing not to drive and the practical consequences in terms of work and social relationships.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
