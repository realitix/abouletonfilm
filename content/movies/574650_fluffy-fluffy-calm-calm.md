The viewer sees the eyeball darting around and also sees what the eyeball sees as well. The week has been condensed down to 9 min. This film was an experiment that worked. I shot all the eyeshots using my friend Letitia Tyler on 200ft of film and shot all the other shots on another 200ft. I then cut the negative together without ever seeing what the film looked like projected. I just wanted the editing process to be all part of the eye theme. I was hoping that it would all say something, and it does.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vpX8df2wDfIBf9V6kshdMt9Tk99.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
