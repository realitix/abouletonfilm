For years, there has been whispers, rumors and gossip about who are her real parents. When Tom Bates returns to town, he takes over the house and practice that Judge Merrivale left him when he died. As Tom has been away a number of years, this leads to more gossip and Mary believes that he is her father. The popular and rich Ken loves Mary, but his family and friends constantly remind him that she is 'not one of us'. Julia, a teacher at school encourages Mary but Mary cannot get a break in anything she does, or is accused of doing. Tom knows the answer to her true identity, and he is silent.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Z035NDo9XbVtzyUiDJzO6eQo1H.jpg", "actors": ["Ronald Reagan (Thomas J.
