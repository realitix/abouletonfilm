The story is an allegory. As the kids climb a mountain and encounter various troubles along the way we learn to let God be our strength and put our Whole hearts into what we do (as Unto the Lord). We discover that our limitations can be an opportunity for God to be glorified through our weakness. We also learn the valuable lesson that we solve problems and face challenges one step at a time...with Jesus by our side.\" We pray that you would encourage your children to apply these truths in their everyday lives. Watch them grow as you help them discover their God-given potential...and learn to \"glow\" and give the glory all to God.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uC005yFBgdAMDV57w1ZFPtO3Rye.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
