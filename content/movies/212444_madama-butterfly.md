Her voice and acting are stunning. Nazzareno Antinori is also a solid Pinkerton with a pleasing voice, and Eleonora Jacovic is a wonderful Suzuki. To top things off the scenery is quite well done, and the staging is effective. I can't imagine any other filmed \"Butterfly\" being better than this one.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cQFOW80m5odH7LFQcevZValp6nB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
