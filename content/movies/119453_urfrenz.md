But is he a suitor or a stalker, a friend or foe? The mystery of his existence fuels obsession, denial and deceit, sending her to the point of no return. In the midst of cliques, boyfriends, and digital drama, Catharine is trying to make sense of a world of uncertain identities. The film was inspired by the writer-director's own experience parenting his teenage daughter in the world of cyberspace. @urFRENZ was made to serve as a talking point for the subject matter of bullying and cyberbullying, the number one hot button issue between parents and teens today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/anLKnW6ZrhZheWfmx62odYYUQqh.jpg", "actors": ["Gayla Goehl (Debbie)", "Lily Holleman (Catharine)", "Michael Robert Kelly (Jacob)", "Najarra Townsend (Madison)", "Bree Essrig (Hannah)", "Paul Carafotes (Terry)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
