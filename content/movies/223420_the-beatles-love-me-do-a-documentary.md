It was a moment that changed music history and popular culture forever. It was also an extraordinary year in social and cultural history, not just for Liverpool but for the world, with the Cuban missile crisis, John Glenn in space and beer at a shilling a pint. Stuart Maconie explores how the Beatles changed from leather and slicked back hair to suits and Beatle mops, and how their fashion set the pace for the sixties to follow. Pop artist Sir Peter Blake, Bob Harris and former Beatles drummer Pete Best join friends to reflect on how the Beatles evolved into John, Paul, George and Ringo - the most famous band in the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zwc2CaKzikFGI3boFmq7meNShE0.jpg", "actors": ["John Lennon ()", "Paul McCartney ()", "George Harrison ()", "Ringo Starr ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "X3jO1OAEPzo"}
