When he was a kid.\u2019 \u00b7 \u2018A monster?\u2019 \u00b7 \u2018Yeah, a monster. It moves between this world and the next.\u2019  Ao lives with his mother and little sister Kii on Sado Island in Japan. He misses his father, who recently disappeared without a trace \u2013 although not much is spoken about it. While their mother tries to deal with the loss in her own way, Ao and Kii run across the island and scream at the ocean. In the mysterious Sayoko, who inconspicuously swipes books from the school library, Ao finds a confidant. Few words are needed between the two reticent, dreamy children: together, they at once feel less alone. Against the striking backdrop of an industrialised coastal town, Tetsuya Tomina's poetic film tells a tale of dreams, loss and monsters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yzOJ7YYkVS2aEu8LQEv0wlXDSZp.jpg", "actors": ["Hizuki Tanaka (Ao)", "Yayako Uchida (Midori)", "Tsubaki Tanaka (Kii)", "Masato Hagiwara (Asano)", "Yuya Uchida (Michio Mukoda)", "Kaiji Moriyama (Kimura)", "Ninon ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
