Diagnosed in 1995 with the most lethal cancer known to medicine, a primary brain tumour called glioblastoma multiforme, he was given just a few months to live. But a natural born maverick, and rigorous scientist, Ben decided he woud not go down without a fight. Nineteen years later his story is an inspiration to patients the world over, whilst his case is dismissed by the medical community as just one of a handful of statistical outliers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9bZhE1F9fEFpnZIygRDRVjzuYSN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
