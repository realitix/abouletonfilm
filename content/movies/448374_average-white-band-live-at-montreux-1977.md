From the opening bars of their signature tune \"Pick Up The Pieces\" through to a storming version of \"I Heard It Through The Grapevine\", they hold the audience in the palm of their hand. In between, they sprinkle hits such as \"Work To Do\", \"A Love Of Your Own\" and \"Cut The Cake\".", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
