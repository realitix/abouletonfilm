The farmer is outraged and banishes Sugarfoot from the farm. Sugarfoot is determined to make the money needed to buy his master a new tractor, and he becomes a movie-double for a screen Wonder Horse of the Movies, and makes enough money to buy a new tractor. The farmer forgives him and, as a reward, takes him to the movies, where Sugarfoot sees the star-horse getting all the credit for all of Sugarfoot's stunt-doubling.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9ktqefSAv7LjCVTG2Zn4g726Xn4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
