Full of nostalgic songs and acts, some with the original artists. Reissued in 1950 as \"Atlantic City Honeymoon\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mFrob7Hzkszb8UBAalikJO9RCMT.jpg", "actors": ["Constance Moore (Marilyn Whitaker)", "Stanley Brown (Brad Taylor)", "Charley Grapewin (Jake Taylor)", "Jerry Colonna (The Professor)", "Paul Whiteman (Himself)", "Louis Armstrong (Himself)", "Robert B.
