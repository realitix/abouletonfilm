The film reflects on his life through interviews with family, colleagues, and his own cinematography, including the moment of his death while filming for the Unit in 1976.  Although the film has later been attributed to Mustafa Abu Ali, the Unit\u2019s method of work was to describe everyone as a collective of \u201cworkers,\u201d and we see this in the film titles, which collectively list the names of all those who participated as a non-hierarchical collective.  Through this reflection on Jawharieh, we are offered an understanding of the workings of the Palestine Film Unit and its international connections.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pNOfrAyntSxvB8349v7kd93AjWF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
