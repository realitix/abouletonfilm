The robot lands and does some exploring of his own, gulping up rock samples and photographing the Cat, Nick, Sally, and Fish before blasting off back into space. What was that thing? Where did it come from? Where is it going? The Cat in the Hat fires up his Space-ama-racer and whisks Nick, Sally and Fish off on a cosmic adventure in search of the robot. Together, they survive a dust storm on the surface of Mars, rocket through an asteroid belt, and then narrowly escape being sucked into Jupiter by its huge gravitational pull. Ultimately, they hitch a ride on a comet that leads them all safely back to the Space Station, along with plenty of space samples, and stories and even a small souvenir that follows The Cat in the Hat and our crew back to Earth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qVT5kUwAb9InXWJ48BBp3N29Oon.jpg", "actors": ["Martin Short (The Cat in the Hat)", "Alexa Torrington (Sally)", "Jacob Ewaniuk (Nick)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "l4Mb8K2rM1c"}
