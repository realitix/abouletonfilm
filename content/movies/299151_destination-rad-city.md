When his 80s-inspired lifestyle results in him being the laughing stock of his small town, Rick sets out to fulfill his late father's wish to attend Rocklahoma, an 80s-themed music festival in the United States.  Getting there proves to be much more difficult than Rick imagined; shady club owners, untrustworthy friends, and a lack of money threaten to crush Rick's dreams, and leave him forever stranded in a town that ostracizes him for being different. To reach Rocklahoma, Rick will be forced to make the most important and potentially heartbreaking decision of his life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6l99Qmd5a0IJzwIJui0xJtpx2z3.jpg", "actors": ["Boris Godzinevski (Rick Trickanovsky)", "Keren Ray (Vicki Rubinsky)", "Paul Gallina (Payne Stukkenfaagenburger)", "Rocky Paulino (Rocky)", "Ryan Treftlin (Trevor Mereel)", "Chris Warren (Derek McMurphy)", "Brent Baines (Donnie)", "Matthew McManus (Marcus McManus)", "Emma Sutherland (Michelle)", "Gabrielle Pillon (Jessica)", "Alexandra Isenor (Tiffany)", "Jessica Lynch (Cindy)", "Heidi Spicer (Brittany)", "Claire Stollery (Samantha)", "Lydia Riding (Gloria)", "Brando Hare (Brando)", "Max Eden (Max Eden)", "Josh Fogarasi (Hobo)", "Nathan Redburn (Parker)", "Matthew Paulino (Jeremy Mitchell)", "Maggie McMichael (Ashlyn)", "Alexena Whiting (Harmony)", "Natasha Adams (Stacy)", "Conor Murphy (Blayne Robinson)", "Andre Chretien (Chad)", "Chris Sakaili (Chris Bromsted)", "Grace Fournier (Kendra)", "Katie Buitendyk (Tanya)", "Sean Gardhouse (Swinger)", "Natalie Fu (Swinger's Girlfriend)", "Areej Rashid (Escort)", "Michael Braham (Walker)", "Nicolas St. Amour (Bartender)", "Teigen Berry (Young Rick Trickanovsky)", "Tyler Misner (Chrysander)", "Phil Akwell (Jamspot Guitarist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
