He's due to ship out, but hits it off with her, so he sticks around. Trouble brewing on many fronts - singer's best friend doesn't like the sailor, and singer has another suitor anyway. Rich guy takes her to all the fancy Cuban sports events - jai-alai, horse racing. Much more glamorous than spending time with Sailor. Can he win her over before he gets in trouble for letting his ship sail without him?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6D2o6v5xcPlmUcGlFyWXwA7zTqP.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Whalen ()", "Doris Dowling ()", "Tommy Wonder ()", "Dee Tatum ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
