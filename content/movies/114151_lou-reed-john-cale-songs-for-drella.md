Drella was a nickname for Warhol coined by Warhol Superstar Ondine, a contraction of Dracula and Cinderella, used by Warhol's crowd. The song cycle focuses on Warhol's interpersonal relations and experiences, with songs falling roughly into three categories: Warhol's first-person perspective (which makes up the vast majority of the album), third-person narratives chronicling events and affairs, and first-person commentaries on Warhol by Reed and Cale themselves. The songs on the album are, to some extent, in chronological order.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/55bQaSLPnBGqbDefb7nWfNE9dli.jpg", "actors": ["Lou Reed ()", "John Cale ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
