It warms a man\u2019s body down to it\u2019s roots. Passion rises in the heat. And when Buckshot Men are involved, it doesn\u2019t take long for the Big Rigs to come out and play. The wide-open spaces of the desert country of California serve as the backdrop for the action as ten masculine and muscular men respond to the heat and do what comes naturally with each other. Using several fan favorites, award-winning producer/director John Rutherford has put together a cast that will make viewers feel the heat no matter where they are. Recent discoveries are teamed with seasoned performers to make a memorable group of men who drive their Big Rigs to deliver the goods.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ApXkbEfQP0rLd6qHI2qdbKyPb58.jpg", "actors": ["Jason Crew ()", "Gus Mattox ()", "Colby Taylor ()", "Tamas Eszterhazy ()", "Brad Patton ()", "Blake Nolan ()", "Brian Hansen ()", "Kristian Alvarez ()", "Eddy Mataro ()", "Omer ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
