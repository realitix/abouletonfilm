Staring directly into the camera, he first places multicolored gels on the lens, then projects slides of pure color. Exploring video's electronic color system, he points the camera at a monitor and adjusts the color switches, creating a chain reaction, a video \"hall of mirrors.\" Finally, he totally immerses his figure in saturated fields of electronic video color, his body ultimately submerged in the technology.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4b43e9BI0ROyPa9cykZu44FxKcQ.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Campus ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
