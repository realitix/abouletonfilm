{"tmdb_id": 228255, "title": "Zero Degrees", "original_title": "Zero Degrees", "slug_title": "zero-degrees", "date": "2008-12-01", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "ZERO DEGREES is a remarkable collaboration between four of today's most respected artists.  Moroccan-Flemish SIDI LARBI CHERKAOUI is well known for his work with Les Ballets C. de la B. while AKRAM KHAN is world renowned for developing his own 'contemporary Kathak' style, winning numerous awards. For ZERO DEGREES they bring their unique styles together in this spellbinding piece of dance.  Mercury Award winning composer/producer NITIN SAWHNEY adds his own East-meets-West sound with a specially commissioned score played live by four musicians, and Turner Prize winner ANTONY GORMLEY has contributed the staging - two life-size casts of the dancers.  ZERO DEGREES explores borders - between countries, cultures and, most importantly, between life and death. It challenges, prompts and inspires, in a seamless fusion of dance styles, music and contemporary art.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
