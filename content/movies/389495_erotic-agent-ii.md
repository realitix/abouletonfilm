Tin Gin found an ancient box while he was cutting wood in the forest. Tin Gin brought the box home and opened it. A beautiful genie was released and granted them 3 wishes every month. All they can think of were some stupid wishes (related to sex of course). Tam and Kam Chi were a rich couple living in the same village. They heard about the box and stole it.
