On his own now, Dakota winds up in trouble in a small Texas town and finds work at the Diamond Thoroughbred Horse Ranch. Although out of his element, he begins to build a life for himself. He comes to know the Lechners: Walt, a horseman of unexpected wisdom; Molly, a spirited and independent girl who captures Dakota's heart; and Casey, a persistent 12-year-old boy who stirs memories he would rather ignore. When his past inexorably catches up with him, Dakota must choose to keep on running, or face his enemies with the beautiful woman he has come to love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/inB5oEjF2GFbL0D07xv2FquCh3X.jpg", "actors": ["Amanda Plummer (Laura Vaughn)", "Richard Jenkins (Bobby Pate)", "Hallie Foote (Elizabeth Vaughn)", "William Converse-Roberts (Horace Robedaux)", "Horton Foote Jr. (Steve Tyler)", "Tonea Stewart (Aunt Charity)", "Rochelle Oliver (Mrs. Vaughn)", "Steven Hill (George Tyler)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
