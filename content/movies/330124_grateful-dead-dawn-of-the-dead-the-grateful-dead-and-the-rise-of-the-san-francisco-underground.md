Known as 'psychedelia', it was pioneered by a close-knit community of local bands who merged traditional American forms such as folk, country, blues and rock &amp; roll with new sounds often developed under the influence of psychedelic drugs. Bound up with the social and cultural changes for which San Francisco was also the focal point, it was a combination that made for a radical re-imaging of youth culture. This film traces the movements, events and sounds of those heady days, and traces the story of the definitive band of the psychedelic age, The Grateful Dead. Giving time too for the involvement of Frisco's other lead players such as Big Brother &amp; The Holding Company, Jefferson Airplane, The Charlatans and Quicksilver Messenger Service.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vnQ2f2JRLiWOcdEXJya9FhwniB4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
