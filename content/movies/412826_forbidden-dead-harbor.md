Work was filmed in Asylum for adults in Bidru\u017eica. Without any real care or therapy, under hard sedatives and drugs, inhabitants of Asylum wasted their days without any meaningful activities \u2013 walking in circles in the yard, sitting on the benches or in the best case drinking in local pubs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xgxisO4CT3TGYGNft2kioyLOZn8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
