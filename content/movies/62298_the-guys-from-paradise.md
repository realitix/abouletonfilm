Young up-and-coming salaryman Kohei Hayakawa is sent to Paradise prison on false drug charges, and assumes his lawyers will clear up this misunderstanding fairly quickly. However, he soon comes to the realization that his innocence means less than how much bribe money he\u2019s able to come up with for his release. It becomes apparent that Kohei is going to have to get to know his fellow inmates a little better, as he\u2019s obviously in this situation for the long haul; but meeting a female inmate from a nearby jail certainly makes his transition to the criminal life a little easier to take.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5xVN15xRyPyuN0MUXRAkGxvaFu4.jpg", "actors": ["K\u00f4ji Kikkawa (K\u00f4hei Hayasaka)", "Tsutomu Yamazaki (Katsuaki Yoshida)", "Ken'ichi End\u00f4 (Toshiyuki Umino)", "Hua Rong Weng (Jun Sakamoto)", "Kenji Mizuhashi (Filipintaro)", "Kazuhiko Kanayama (Koji Sugimori)", "Nene Otsuka (Namie Mishima)", "Mai Oikawa (Miyuki Hayasaka)", "Monsour Del Rosario ()", "Toshiyuki Kitami ()", "Mitsuhiro Oikawa ()", "Hideo Sako ()", "Naoto Takenaka ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
