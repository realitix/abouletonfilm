A new group of patients arrive at a hospital to be treated for tuberculosis where they all take a fancy to one of the nurses. The film was adapted from the play Ring for Catty by Patrick Cargill and Jack Beale. Carry on Nurse from 1959 was based on the same play.  The cast and production team of Twice Round the Daffodils create a noticeable similarity with the Carry On films, but the film is not an official member of the Carry On series.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sht8mFQau0ipf5XHxvKcLzcByEp.jpg", "actors": ["Juliet Mills (Catty)", "Donald Sinden (Ian Richards)", "Donald Houston (John Rhodes)", "Kenneth Williams (Henry Halfpenny)", "Ronald Lewis (Bob White)", "Andrew Ray (Chris Walker)", "Joan Sims (Harriet Halfpenny)", "Jill Ireland (Janet)", "Lance Percival (George Logg)", "Sheila Hancock (Dora)", "Nanette Newman (Joyce)", "Ren\u00e9e Houston (Matron)", "Amanda Reiss (Dorothy)", "Mary Powell (Mrs. Rhodes)", "Barbara Roscoe (Mary)", "Peter Jesson (Joyce's Young Man)", "Frank Forsyth (Dorothy's Father)", "Olwen Brookes (Dorothy's Mother)", "Nora Gordon (Cleaner)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [97103, 208374, 163848, 226124], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
