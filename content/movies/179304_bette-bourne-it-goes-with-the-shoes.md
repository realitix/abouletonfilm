This is a richly enjoyable exploration of the life of a born performer with some great archive footage and rare photographs. A highly successful career on the London stage was put on hold when Bette discovered gay liberation. But out of a gay drag commune in Notting Hill, Bette fashioned a glorious theatre troupe Bloolips, bringing together a unique blend of costume, camp and musical theatre leavened with sexual politics. The film offers an insight into a passionate and gifted actor who has made a great contribution to gay life, art and politics.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/abhNpCXsmH931mxyLI7NZ7ChA39.jpg", "actors": ["Bette Bourne (himself)", "Mark Ravenhill (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "IWwNqFMYH9g"}
