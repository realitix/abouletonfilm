His peroxide blond hair sticks in all directions; he's dressed in a skin-tight, short, off-one-shoulder, sparkling dress that he says he got from the Queen, who wouldn't wear it. The set includes Gang Bang (the name-game song), Jungle Jezebel, Born To Be Cheap, Alphabet Rap, Native Love, Shake It Up, and, for an encore, Shoot Your Shot. The band, whom we never see, is techno-rock. Between songs, Divine chats up the audience, usually talking about sex.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qQJGnKCmwFASEMFHrNXpXYymzbz.jpg", "actors": ["Divine ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
