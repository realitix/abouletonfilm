This colorful and courageous activist of the Civil Rights era casts his vote, celebrates Obama's victory and proudly unfurls the American flag as he is inducted into the Foot Soldiers Hall of Fame. Mr. Armstrong links the magnitude of the present paradigm shift with challenges he faced in the past: from his sons' integration into an all white school to the Bloody Sunday march for voting rights. The documentary raises questions about democracy and patriotism in the face of adversity, and the vigilance and action required to ensure continued forward movement to end racial injustice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pJR2fGp5ZrdLZ3YxNrAFBcBddic.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
