With roots in a tribal past, this movement attempts to format the future of a truly global community by combining elements of electronic/percussive music, the psychedelic imagination, and mass dancing. From warehouses to mountain retreats to the deserts of the Mojave, an unseen world comes into clear focus; with kinetic camera work and candid interviews, this slice of visual anthropology probes the underbelly of a worldwide subculture with the help of some of electronic music's most acclaimed DJs, a technomusicologist, and a county sheriff. Open your mind to this moving entertainment experience and intimate portrait of a modern counter-culture that follows its own electronically induced beat.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x4KbvYUaB2QMVbzGXexvBO7GzNa.jpg", "actors": ["Jason Bentley ()", "Carl Cox ()", "Jonathon Moore (Coldcut)", "Sven V\u00e4th ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
