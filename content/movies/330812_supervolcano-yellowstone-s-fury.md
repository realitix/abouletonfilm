But, beneath all this beauty lurks a beast. Yellowstone sits directly above one of the largest volcanic systems on Earth. For the past two million years, this supervolcano has erupted roughly every 600,000 years. The last major eruption occurred 640,000 years ago. So, is it overdue for another eruption? There have been disturbing signals...  Supervolcano: Yellowstone's Fury examines the cataclysmic effect an eruption would have on the world. It would be the largest natural disaster in recorded history. NYU Earth Scientist Michael Rampino warns, \"An eruption like Yellowstone could trigger the end of civilization as we know it.\" For experts, the question is not if there will be another eruption, but when. University of Toronto geologist John Westgate agrees: \"There will be a very large-scale supervolcanic eruption from Yellowstone. That's a fact.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9xGXoYTrNkpzFJtHvEmX4B0ZqYN.jpg", "actors": ["Ann-Marie MacDonald (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
