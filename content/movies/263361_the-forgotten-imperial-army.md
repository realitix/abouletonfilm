The documentary uses TV to problematize the apathy of the Japanese people. According to Oshima\u2019s 'The Idea of Evil and Cruelty' and Sato Tadao\u2019s 'History of Japanese Documentary Film', the actual situation was much more serious and harsher than the documentary depicts.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uBlFCKSXG3xVLkkSz8skxJCrhQt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
