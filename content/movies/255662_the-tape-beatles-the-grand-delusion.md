In addition to taking the usual form of a Tape-beatles release (a CD), The Grand Delusion was also delivered in the form of an \u2018expanded cinema\u2019 presentation involving three-screen motion picture projections and sound. The screen space for this production is intended to be three times the width of the normal 3 to 4 \"Edison\" aspect ratio of 16mm. The presentation only uses the full width intermittently, so transitions from one form to the next has been translated here by means of a video effect.  As a live performance presentation, The Grand Delusion has been screened in dozens of venues across North America and Europe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lu7ZPpzqgIr7yHyHolLEwGoa8dL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "NcxLP_RAV80"}
