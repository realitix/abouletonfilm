One night they hear a voice calling for help in the forest. Although they are scared that it is a spirit trying to trick them, they follow the voice and discover that it is coming from a bamboo tree. The bamboo tree is wounded, and asks them to pull out the arrow that is stuck in it. They comply, and the bamboo transforms into a young woman, who explains that she is a supernatural spirit. She thanks them and gives them each a magical item. Do receives a magic carpet that can fly, Re receives a telescope that can see anything the viewer asks of it, and Mi receives a harmonica that can give them any wishes they want.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1eiy8jEG43aNLToU3PNy6X6VCcL.jpg", "actors": ["P.
