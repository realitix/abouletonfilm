The hall was packed, and the crowd experienced the tremendous power of the full orchestra, full choir, superpumped rock band and dynamic and diverse lead vocalists. The Globus sound is the emotional, powerful and rousing music often heard in Hollywood film trailers, and this performance is the first ever live show featuring music from popular trailers such as \"Spiderman 2\", \"Da Vinci Code\", \"Ghost Rider\", \"Kingdom of Heaven\" and many more. The concert film delivers stunning visuals and a thunderous 5.1 digital surround sound experience, bringing the explosive sonic power of the 120 member orchestral rock band from the stage to the screen!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cOilFrE8BdlgzS7jFpQEtSsf7gs.jpg", "actors": ["Yoav Goren (Himself)", "Lisbeth Scott (Herself)", "Jeffrey Fayman (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "iTEppbm16yg"}
