But when Liszt takes Josy, a young violin virtuoso, under his wing, he awakens his own creativity. Features music from Carnival in Pest, The Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2, and The Mephisto Waltz. Historically accurate and musically adept, this video is a valuable resource for music appreciation programs.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
