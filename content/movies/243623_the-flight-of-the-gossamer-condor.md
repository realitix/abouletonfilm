Renowned inventor Dr. Paul MacCready and his team were filmed creating the world-famous pedal-powered airplane as it happened. Producing this film which documents the development of a man's dream into a scientific and historic achievement was, in itself, an extraordinary effort. There was an immense risk involved in making a commitment to film a scientist's effort at achieving something which had never done before successfully.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4j10MFbjGFgJissZKrwrzGnYV49.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
