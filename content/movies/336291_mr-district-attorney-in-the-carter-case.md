Like the first entry, this one is played mostly for laughs, with Radio's Mister District Attorney. James Ellison replacing Dennis O'Keefe as feckless assistant DA P. Cadwallader Jones. The publisher of a tony fashion magazine is murdered, requiring Jones to sift through a colorful array of suspects. He is helped (?) along by snoopy girl reporter Terry Parker (Virginia Gilmore), who by default is the brightest character in the picture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aFniJjo6ixLUsy6AfqlsXK9PTA9.jpg", "actors": ["James Ellison (P.
