We learn where the name came from and why the Directors Guild of America (DGA) first allowed his name to be used on Richard Widmark's western Death of a Gunfighter. The film follows the numerous problems that director Tony Kaye had during the production and post-production of the film American History X and why the DGA refused to allow Alan Smithee to be credited for that film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ohsr48fcAA40WIoe0p3WsApDZ3e.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
