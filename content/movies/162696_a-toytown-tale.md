The toymaker goes up to bed, leaving his wind-up policeman to guard the shop, and the other toys come to life. First order of business: throw that pesky cop into the glue pot. The wind-up soldiers march around. They pass a doll, and the lead soldier stops them so he can go woo her. He has some success, until they are threatened by an elephant; he sucks up the other soldiers, and our hero cowers in fear. Then a monkey attacks, and our soldier continues not to be brave.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/efs9gGzbxJJd0hF4QzouxFfn3Mn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
