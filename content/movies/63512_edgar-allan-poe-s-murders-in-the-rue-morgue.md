In watching, I quite agree that as fine an actor as Robards was, his heart wasn't in horror and thus his tone is off here. Still, Herbert Lom is great as the antagonist and there are many enjoyable wonders to behold.\r\n\r\nI strongly feel that had Price acted in Robards' place, this film would have joined the fine string of minor masterpieces Price starred in during that purple patch of his career."}], "recommandations_id": [62947, 31561, 77173, 42452]}
