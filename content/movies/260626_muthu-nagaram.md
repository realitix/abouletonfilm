Viswa and his friends are accused of a crime not committed by them. The elders sit in judgment and award punishment to them without giving them a chance to be heard and to prove their innocence. As an expression of resentment, the boys commit a petty crime, albeit playfully. It lands them in serious trouble. How they manage to come out of it unscathed is the crux of the story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qMvXwbCyJgsy2MPLRPjlCQDTWAy.jpg", "actors": ["Visvaa ()", "Asrik Banu ()", "Chaams ()", "Kadhal Thandapani ()", "Nandha Saravanan ()", "Muthukalai ()", "Kadhal Sukumar ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
