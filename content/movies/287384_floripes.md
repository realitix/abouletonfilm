Enchanted moors are one of the cornerstones of Portuguese mythology.  They are often seductive and being temptresses, they can offer a powerful reward, but also a terrible curse.  Left in Portugal during the Reconquista while her family went back to North Africa, beautiful Floripes was condemned to roam her ancient kingdom in the Algarve until a man could undo her curse. Then she would marry him and give him her fabulous treasure. But if the man fails, she must eat his heart.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3hRWzkas0EXbO21sHU0JaX0gsiJ.jpg", "actors": ["Selma Cifka (Floripes)", "Catarina Barros (Aninhas)", "Jo\u00e3o Salero (Quinzinho)", "Jo\u00e3o Sancho (Juli\u00e3o)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "8_cHq2qRR08"}
