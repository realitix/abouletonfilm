While most of them enjoy the meal, one man has a strange reaction: Taking a set of horns off the wall, he attaches them to his head and sets off on a rampage. After destroying the house and terrifying his hostess, her guests, maid, and neighbours, he takes to the streets. The police sends a telegraph to Spain asking for help, and in response a parade of matadors arrive in Paris, ready to slay the crazy beast-man. However, soon after the man-bull fight begins, the errant guest comes to his senses and is taken into custody by waiting policemen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A1JCMhbyA2JCoD9ec775psRVrvi.jpg", "actors": ["Ren\u00e9e Carl ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
