Riding hard, Clay's horse goes lame and he is forced to pull-up at a nearby farm. He soon discovers that the place belongs to local preacher Hollis Jarret, his new wife, and a son from a previous marriage. Clay, posing as a weary traveler, tries to insinuate himself into a secure hideout, but the reverend isn't fooled. He agrees to allow Clay to remain at the farm for a few days, but his motive isn't the preservation of his family's safety. Hollis reasons that, with time, patience and a lot of faith, he can convince the outlaw to turn over a new leaf. But Clay's criminal tendencies may run deeper than the preacher had imagined", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d1JYuY5xE7CFjgvnYJ9MWpRs6OI.jpg", "actors": ["Macdonald Carey (Hollis Jarret)", "Patricia Medina (Peg Jarret)", "Skip Homeier (Clay Anderson)", "Stephen Wootton ('Dodie' Jarret)", "Louis Jean Heydt (Sheriff John Tatum)", "Howard Wright ('Doc' Parks)", "Slim Pickens (Ben Silas)", "Malcolm Atterbury (Rev.
