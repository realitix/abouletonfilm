Using their experiences to ease the paths of others, each works in public health in their old neighbourhood while struggling to maintain their newly-found stability. Told over five years, The Stairs defies stereotypes about drug use, sex work and homelessness through an intimate portrait that is by turns funny, surprising and moving.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4n5CoGK2lbQW8mTZ0zEzMJVYk6F.jpg", "actors": ["Martin Thompson ()", "Roxanne Smith ()", "Greg Bell ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
