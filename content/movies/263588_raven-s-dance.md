The young husband goes out hunting but only to support himself and his wife, not to kill off hordes of animals. He sets traps, and that gets him in trouble with the police who proceed to ticket him for using the devices. The forest cycles themselves are intimated when an old tree is shown falling to earth -- perhaps a reflection on the old man's passing years. In contrast to these few people living off the land and basically keeping the ecological balance intact, a highway construction crew is shown at work felling trees. Soon the antagonism grows between encroaching civilization and the quiet life of the young couple and elderly man.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5HkTcI6mBxGOiToxjM2bEFSwiIc.jpg", "actors": ["Pertti Kalinainen (Petteri Jokiaho)", "Paavo Katajasaari (Paavo)", "Hilkka Matikainen (Hilkka Jokiaho)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
