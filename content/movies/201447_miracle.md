For Dennis P. there's only one way out - pray. In this musical adventure the miracle comes in the shape of an angel clone looking suspiciously like Dennis P.'s late father. The angel issues Dennis P. with a license to perform medium grade miracles, but there's a string attached - Dennis P. must stop using swearwords. Dennis P. throws himself into readjusting his existence. But one miracle leads to another, and the 'adjustments' lead to grotesque consequences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vdslIUUISjOD4ZwFzNhH0HotsPL.jpg", "actors": ["Stefan Pagels Andersen (Dennis)", "Sidse Babett Knudsen (Mona Pedersen)", "Thomas Bo Larsen (The Angel)", "Sebastian Jessen (Michael 'Mick')", "Peter Fr\u00f6din (Sandstr\u00f8m)", "Stephania Potalivo (Karen Elise)", "Zeev Sevik Perl (Grillejer Giorgos)", "Olaf Nielsen (Tjener)", "Signe Fabricius (Micks mor)", "Mette Berggreen (Micks mors veninde)", "Andreas Andersen (Verner)", "Regitze Stenderup (Dansepige uden partner)", "Sasia M\u00f8lgaard (Julie)", "Magnus Rudbech (Lille Dennis P)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [191293, 121530, 60469, 20661], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
