By some, this Ring is known as \"The designer Ring\", due to the striking sets and costumes by designer Rosalie, which in many ways make up the most striking aspects of this Ring Cycle.  Kirchner and Rosalie publicly stated a desire to depart from the political Ring productions of previous Bayreuth Ring directors such as Kupfer and Ch\u00e9reau and free Wagner\u00b4s work from all the \"ideological and philosophical\" ballast. Do they succeed? Well, in a way yes. But what they create instead is an environment reminiscent of a Japanese version of Star Wars, devoid of dramatic interaction between the main characters, who often stand still and just sing to the audience oblivious of the characters the singing supposedly is directed towards.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/96D5aK7TeghCIOAGRoG1tXDRo1P.jpg", "actors": ["Wolfgang Schmidtke ()", "Deborah Polaski ()", "Eric Halfvarson ()", "Anne Schwanewilms ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
