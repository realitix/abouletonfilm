Following this is a match between two giant negro wrestlers, who first fence with slicks and then grapple with each other. The start of a caravan is next pictured, the handling of the huge camels being well demonstrated. A British courier next comes into view and the African, presumably sheiks, attack him. A short sham fight takes place, and he escapes. Now a religious procession of natives is shown, with their tom-toms and curious devices for making curious music. The last is a photo of a comical looking African infant playing with a kitten.\u201d (Moving Picture World)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qjGUAXlB1T8KnWWyR0vYutgUHuo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
