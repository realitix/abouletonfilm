The differences between national Republicans however are revealing: The fascist side has the unconditional support of arms and men facilitated by Hitler and Mussolini while the Republican army is ignored by a Europe more concerned of a possible World War than the fate of Spain. Thousands of young people between 17 and 18 rows are called by the republican army. These are the main characters, four young for whom the Battle of the Ebro will be the first direct contact with the war. This film tells the story of these young people forced to leave behind innocence and into whistling bullets.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d2tT1erZXLNoQjVzRUIJJuzQXZX.jpg", "actors": ["Oriol Pla (Pere Puig)", "Enric Auquer (Ferm\u00ed Quintana)", "\u00c0lex Monner (Valent\u00ed Godall)", "Emilio Palacios (Jaume Comelles)", "Roser Tapias ()", "Artur Busquets ()", "Manuel Mor\u00f3n (Manuel Aza\u00f1a)", "Adolfo Fern\u00e1ndez (Juan Negr\u00edn)", "Kimberley Tell (Nan Green)", "Ann M.
