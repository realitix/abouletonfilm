The 16-year-old Mette is always off with her friends at the disco or skating, and the father does not mind until he discovers that young J\u00f8nne has taken some semi-nude photos of Mette and clearly is intending to go further in their relationship. Suddenly the father starts hanging out with Mette and her friends as they practice winter sports together - and there is hardly anything stranger, or more embarrassing, as far as Mette is concerned.
