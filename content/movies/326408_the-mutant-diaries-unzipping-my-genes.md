Superpowers stem from incredible sacrifices in 'The Mutant Diaries: Unzipping My Genes', a feisty and frank solo musical from performer/composer Eva Moon. Upon learning she had the BRCA genetic mutation, which spikes the risk of breast cancer to 87% and ovarian cancer to 55%, Moon had to make a life-altering choice: remove her healthy breasts and ovaries or face terrifying odds of cancer. Live music, warmth and generous amounts of humor are all expertly woven in this story of her decision -- and the extraordinarily empowering results of that choice. The Mutant Diaries: Unzipping My Genes - a musical about telling cancer to take a hike - was filmed live on stage at Rogue Machine Theatre in Los Angeles.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
