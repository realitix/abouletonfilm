After feeling abandoned by her love (The Boy), Amianto finds shelter in the presence of her dead friend, Blanche, that will protect her against her pain - at least as far as she can. Her inner universe collides with the reality of a world that does not accept her, a world to which she doesn't belong and that invariably she comes back with her playful delusions, mixing reality and fantasy. With the help of her Fairy Godmother, Amianto gathers strength to continue living in the hope of being happy someday.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pE9htT0dCzBhiW64adAvfHWkTOd.jpg", "actors": ["Deynne Augusto (Amianto)", "Uir\u00e1 dos Reis (Blanche)", "Dario Oliveira (Rapaz)", "Rodrigo Fernandes (Herbbie)", "Rafaela Di\u00f3genes (Gl\u00f3ria)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "td0HwtQH9TI"}
