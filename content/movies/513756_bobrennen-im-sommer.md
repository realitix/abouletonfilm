On a summer Alpen meadow, he patiently constructs a track of about ten thousand wooden slats. Thanks to the stop motion technique, his camera takes us on a thundering journey through the mountain landscape. The soundtrack provides an Olympic atmosphere.

And a curious example of land art.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/chWImiATIAdmWE1Tic8ARauElg1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
