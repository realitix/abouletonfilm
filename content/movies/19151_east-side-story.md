The arrival of the Anglo newcomers rocks the quiet world of Diego Campos (Rene Alvarado), a handsome young local who is tired of being played for a boy toy by his closeted real estate agent lover Pablo (David Beron). Will Diego stay at home and fulfill his Mexican grandmother\u2019s desire for him to inherit the family restaurant - or will he follow his heart and become a chef in the big city? Award winning producer Carlos Portugal makes his directorial debut with a winning combination of quirky characters, rich storylines and suggestive situations that will appeal to fans of Latino telenovelas and popular series such as \"Sex and the City,\" \"Ugly Betty\" and \"Queer As Folk.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vAnj0nIESOt6agbm3uB6pln9XVt.jpg", "actors": ["Luis Accinelli (Don Rogelio)", "Ren\u00e9 Alvarado (Diego Campos)", "David Ber\u00f3n (Pablo Morales)", "Steve Callahan (Wesley Henderson)", "Michael Cassady (Dennis)", "Dominic Ceci (Adam)", "Irene DeBari (Sara Campos)", "Yelyna De Leon (Tiffany)", "Carl Donelson (AA Guest #2)", "Anthony Fitzgerald (Jimmy)", "Gladys Jimenez (Bianca Campos)", "Shannon Kemp (Steve)", "Cory Schneider (Jonathon Webber)", "Andrea Zafra (Janice Morales)", "Ruben Rabasa (Efrain Morales)", "Luis Ra\u00fal (Salvador)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [151772, 79913, 21486, 19797], "youtube_key": "KhlK6KzRe1w"}
