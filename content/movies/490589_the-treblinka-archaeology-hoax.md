This film exposes Dr. Sturdy Colls\u2019s investigations as a massive fraud.  For instance, her research actually included digging near clearly marked Christian graves; she also falsely assigned homicidal intent to a normal life-saving bath and disinfection complex.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xMc4XkmM7UcJ3Qtvd42jXYmKThO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
