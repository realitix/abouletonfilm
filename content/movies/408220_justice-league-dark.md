It's also cool to see the oft-shunned Deadman get some attention, and I'll always give Batman-starring media a chance. But I have not been a fan of DC's more recent animated offerings. I feel they are simply going through the motions, and _Justice League Dark_ is no great exception.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}], "recommandations_id": [379291, 408647, 366924, 297556], "youtube_key": "cddLDL_kKOU"}
