These include Kevin Patterson, Tim Nice-But-Dim, Wayne and Waynetta Slob, Dragons' Den, The Scousers and Smashie and Nicey. Harry and Paul also take it in turns to play the host of celebrities that have joined them to celebrate their anniversary, such as Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell from BBC Drama Wolf Hall; Rob Brydon, Ricky Gervais, Prince Charles, Miranda Hart, Stephen Hawking, Boris Johnson, Melyn Bragg and Jimmy Carr as they take viewers on a trip down memory lane.
