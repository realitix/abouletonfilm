It almost immediately became a symbol of the resistance to Serbian nationalism and all that Slobodan Milosevic decreed.

They also describe their own contribution, despite all the authorities' efforts to suppress them, to the liberation of their city and their country.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Teofil Pan\u010di\u0107 (Himself)", "Uro\u0161 \u0110uri\u0107 (Himself)", "Borka Pavi\u0107evi\u0107 (Herself)", "Filip David (Himself)", "Sr\u0111a An\u0111eli\u0107 (Himself)", "Maja Atanasijevi\u0107 (Herself)", "Dragan Ambrozi\u0107 (Himself)", "Gordan Paunovi\u0107 (Himself)", "Vladimir Bra\u0161anac (Himself)", "Mi\u0161ko Bilbija (Himself)", "Ninoslav Jovanovi\u0107 (Himself)", "Zoran Kesi\u0107 (Himself)", "Branko Ili\u0107 (Himself)", "Milivoje \u010calija (Himself)", "Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 (Himself (archive footage))", "Vuk Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 (Himself (archive footage))", "Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107 (Himself (archive footage))", "Vesna Pe\u0161i\u0107 (Herself (archive footage))", "Vojislav Ko\u0161tunica (Himself (archive footage))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
