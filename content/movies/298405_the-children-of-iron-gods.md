Its a great cheerless environment; life is arduous and dangerous; conditions at the plant are nearly subhuman. The only excitement in the grimy industrial town is provided by robbing a train at gunpoint or stealing sheep from the Bashkiri tribe. The most renowned diversion, however, is the annual fist fight between the strongest metal worker and the strongest miner from the region. Against his better judgment, but with the support of his co-workers, Ignat decides to take part in this perilous venture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6qP5jj7wClX1dE1Cfnp2BTH55TU.jpg", "actors": ["Evgeniy Sidikhin (Ignat)", "Aleksandr Kalyagin (Foreman)", "Yuriy Yakovlev (General)", "Aleksandr Feklistov (Mityai)", "Mikhail Golubovich (Nasekin)", "Valentin Smirnitskiy (Filipp Ilyich)", "Yuriy Kutsenko (Fyodor)", "Sergey Garmash (Man in drinking-house)", "Nikolai Karnaukhov (Old man)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
