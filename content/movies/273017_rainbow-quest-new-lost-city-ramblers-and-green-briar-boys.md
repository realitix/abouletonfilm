A retro act before the term was even coined, John Cohen's band looked backwards for inspiration, and found much to love in the distinctly old fashioned sound of old- time string bands. The unclassifiable Greenbriar Boys also put in a good showing, weaving their inimitable magic that encompasses elements of country, blues, and bluegrass styles.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
