Does every man possess a \"special something that makes him irresistible to women?\" That\u2019s the question answered in this crackpot flick from the depths of \u201970s Soft-X Smut as it follows the unlikeliest candidate for super-stud the world has ever seen: Finster Fahrquart, The Sexpert.  Finster doesn\u2019t know the first thing about seducing and satisfying a woman and, instead, mugs and pratfalls his way through a series of sexual episodes involving a titty bar, a computer date with a blonde bombshell, a hayseed honey, a lonely virgin in the park, a married woman in a grocery store, three massage parlor girls, and even an orgy complete with shag rugs, body painting, reefer, and snakes. Each encounter plays like an old stag joke and Finster, like the silent-screen comedian he\u2019s imitating, never utters a word.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5224QUCNostAKD8Yn0knOXFlOb0.jpg", "actors": ["Stan Ross (The Sexpert)", "Jeane Manson ((as Jean Manson))", "Jaime Lyn Bauer (Farmer's Daughter)", "Marvin Miller (Michael Anthony)", "Rene Bond (Dessert Girl)", "Sandy Carey (Party Girl in Hat)", "Margie Lanier (Massage Girl #1)", "Ric Lutze (Dessert Guy)", "Antoinette Maynard (Massage Girl #2)", "Steve Vinovich (Brain Surgeon)", "Lois Mitchell (Limo Girl #2)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
