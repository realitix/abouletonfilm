In between the rampant foliage are thousands of stones \u2013 large and small, some artistic-looking, others simple, some magnificent and crumbling; some nameless and others with indecipherable inscriptions.  Wei\u00dfensee is the largest Jewish cemetery still in use in Europe. It is so large that it could contain approximately eighty-six football pitches. Walking through the cemetery is like taking a walk through history and the list of famous artists, philosophers, lawyers, architects, doctors, teachers of religion and publishers who are buried here is long indeed. Not many are aware that in a few years\u2019 time, this protected area will officially be listed as one of UNESCO\u2019s world heritage sites.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zcQf1tG5808gxLz1mRBH8Os30rh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
