From then on he was determined to live as a castaway on an uninhabited Pacific Island with a girl Friday.  When he realised his dream in 1989 he was just 18 years old. The adventure became a media sensation with journalists flying halfway round the world to cover the story. Martin kept a video diary of his experience.  In 2001 he returned to the Pacific to make a critically acclaimed documentary. The Real Castaway reunites the two castaways on their desert island 12 years after their experience. It\u2019s a story about adventure, growing up and the pursuit of an impossible dream.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6083I2tBjjsfH0YrWLDvBSZKcgi.jpg", "actors": ["Martin Popplewell (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "-qSXyz3he3M"}
