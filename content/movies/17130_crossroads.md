For what I can recall as I vaguely remember it, the story was all over the place, actually it was more like a film about \"nothing\". You got these 3 friends (Britney included) going on a road trip together (I know I'm just reading off from the plot lines here) and then they come across this guy who is your typical handsome guy at which point is where the film becomes a load of nonsense with nothing interesting happening, this is where the film pretty much gives up trying to be a movie and goes into soap opera territory but is worse.\r\n\r\nWhat I actually find most baffling is that this film is supposed to be a \"romantic comedy\" film yet there was nothing in this film that was remotely funny. And Britney Spears thought she could have a good crack at movie acting, huh, I don't think so.\r\n\r\nAlthough I don't remember everything from the film since it was years ago since I last saw the film, but then again why would you want to remember an awful movie like this? Really bad movies such as this are best left buried away from the mind to be made forgotten forever."}], "recommandations_id": [6116, 11812, 9266, 17414], "youtube_key": "vb398BOlv0Q"}
