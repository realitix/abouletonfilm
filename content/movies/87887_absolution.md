While on Earth, this spirit becomes involved in terrorism, drug deals, and pornography. Chemicals used in a new super-bomb are to be melted down in VHS tape shells and secretly shipped out of the U.S. as part of a porn film deal. Overseas, the porno tapes will be melted down again so that the chemicals can be extracted and used for mass destruction. The angel wants to stop these evils, though it is the law of the angels to not interfere in human history. The angel jumps from one human host to another, sinking deeper and deeper into the nightmare, becoming more involved. The angel begins to feel the darkest of human emotions: fear... anger... hate... and it all leads to bloodshed, depravity, and intense violence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yoGU0XdJjIu6iryJNcGLxIQFMCI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
