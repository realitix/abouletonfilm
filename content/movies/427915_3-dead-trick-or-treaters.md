Penned by a deranged pulp author driven mad by his craft, the stories chronicle grisly tales of Halloween rites, rituals and traditions. Absent of dialogue and heavy on atmosphere, 3 Dead Trick or Treaters is a horror anthology unlike any you've seen before.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/serFaZpK11QqpWCMruVymnaGA8x.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
