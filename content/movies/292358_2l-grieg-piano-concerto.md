Edvard Grieg himself bears witness to the validity and authenticity of Grainger's interpretation through his own enthusiastic endorsement: \"I had to become sixty-four years old to hear Norwegian piano music interpreted so understandingly and brilliantly. He breaks new ground for himself, for me, and for Norway. And then this enchanting, profound, serious, and childlike naturalness! What a joy to gain a young friend with such qualities!\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xdoH03cD6chZ1YR0H7ZhwUFssTP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
