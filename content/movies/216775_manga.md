Alik, responding to Alisa\u2019s pleas, eventually confronts the pestering Kiwi; a misunderstanding (did he rape her? did he not?) erupts into violence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kmiZuaaDQrCpWfw8yGIRUUAzLNx.jpg", "actors": ["Vasilisa Petina (Alisa)", "Pyotr Khazizov (Alik)", "Yaroslav Zhalnin (Kiwi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
