Pianist and Schnabel devotee Markus Pawlik (in collaboration with baritone Dietrich Henschel and the Szymanowski String Quartet) brings Artur Schnabel's greatest compositions back to Berlin with a filmed commemorative concert. Along the way, Pawlik visits the places, landscapes, and history that shaped Schnabel's life and music. \"Artur Schnabel: No Place of Exile\" rediscovers an essential artist displaced by the catastrophe of the two World Wars and the Holocaust and inspired by the possibilities of modernism.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l65GNcDfupFebh2xgb8SvhYkxc9.jpg", "actors": ["Walter Arlen ()", "Jeanne Bamberger ()", "Rodolfo Augusto Faistauer ()", "Leon Fleisher ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
