By systematically scrutinising the industry that capitalises on the love for man's best friend, Moullet has made an absurdist film that shows how the love of animals has become a kind of surrogate religion for many people. He takes us to canine beauticians and beauty contests, and explores the field from dried dog food to advanced super-duper pooper-scoopers. By showing in great detail all those gadgets and gimmicks to make the lives of pets as agreeable as possible, Moullet vents his barely concealed criticism of consumer society.
