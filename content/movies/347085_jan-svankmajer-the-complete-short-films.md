Technically and conceptually astonishing in their own right, these films are also as remarkable for their philosophical consistency as for their frequently mind-boggling imagery. This package also includes a bonus short, Johanes Doktor Faust (1958), the longer cut of 'The Cabinet of Jan \u0160vankmajer' with a new introduction by the Quay Brothers, the documentary Les Chimeres des \u0160vankmajer (2001), interviews with Jan and Eva \u0160vankmajer and examples of their work in other media. There's also a chance to see some \u0160vankmajer special effects, created when he was banned from directing his own films.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
