Getz possessed an unerring sense of melody and a proficient technique, but it was his rich and distinct tone that branded him as unique -- or so said countless musicians and critics. Getz's last, peerless concert recording, presented on this disc, was captured live in 1990, one year before his death.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
