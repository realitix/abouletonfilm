The most modern 'Gatling Gun' has been stolen from its warehouse in Edo Castle by burglars targeting the very Shogun himself, Tokugawa Ieyoshi (Oide Shun in a masterful performance).  Leading the investigation is the newly appointed chief magistrate of the Arson &amp; Robbery Division, Mayazumi Kuranosuke (Takahashi Hideki, in a powerful role).  Takahashi Hideki stars as the manly, mounted magistrate! This brawny, tremendous sword fight drama is geared towards an adult audience. Co-starring Meguro Yuuki (\"Omi\" in Shogun mini-series), younger brother of superstar, Matsukata Hiroki. And son of screen-legend Konoe Jushiro!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6zSwCSIzzK5yD6pmxY4LG5OyMH5.jpg", "actors": ["Hideki Takahashi (Mayazumi Kuranosuke)", "Y\u00fbki Meguro ()", "Nagisa Katahira ()", "Tetsur\u00f4 Sagawa ()", "Shun \u00d4ide (Tokugawa Ieyoshi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
