Moe and Larry put Curly on a leash and take him to the insurance doctor and have him act like a dog. Unfortunately, the insurance doctor wants to perform a brain operation (Cerebrum decapitation). The boys try to escape by hiding in the dog catchers wagon, but are caught and taken to the hospital. They escape again, this time by rigging a sheet to a gurney and sailing down the street, where they run into Jerry and knock him into wet cement.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Curly Howard (Curly)", "Dorothy Appleby (Dr. Lerious' Receptionist (uncredited))", "Moe Howard ()", "Larry Fine ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [115934, 115920, 116057, 115990], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
