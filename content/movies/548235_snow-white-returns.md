The Seven Dwarfs are returning home from the mine, as they receive a message from Snow White saying that she plans to make her annual visit to their cottage. The dwarfs were excited over the news, and they try to figure out what would be the best gift to give to her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4CBj1DQXEgQJwsmkO74WjeVOBfB.jpg", "actors": ["Don Hahn (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
