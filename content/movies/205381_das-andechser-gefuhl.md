While flies drown in his mug of beer, he confronts a life of failure: the wife he ignored, the child he neglected, the teaching duties he has shirked, and his doomed efforts at winning tenure from school officials. Only a dream from the past-the memory of a former liaison with a film star with whom he shared \"the Andechs feeling, a feeling that we are not alone\" - provides sustenance. Despite an unexpected series of events, longing in Achternbusch's world ultimately remains stronger than fulfilment and thirst better than beer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bTxKs2NAFIpQtNUK8rm7rnPymxI.jpg", "actors": ["Herbert Achternbusch (Teacher)", "Margarethe von Trotta ()", "Barbara Gass (Wife)", "Ingrid Gailhofer (Kellnerin)", "Alois Hitzenbichler (Alois)", "Heinz Braun ()", "Walter Sedlmayr ()", "Reinhard Hauff ()", "Judit Achternbusch ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
