In this fast-paced documentary from the director of the popular films Finger of God, Furious Love, and Father of Lights, Darren Wilson sets out to make a movie that is completely led by the Holy Spirit. No plan, no script, no safety net--just go wherever he feels the Spirit leading him to try and discover the adventure God has for him. Whether it's the riches of Monte Carlo, a heavy metal concert, or the oldest city in the world, the result is a film that not only challenges and excites, but also reveals a God who is far more alive and active than you ever imagined.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qDER6XczDZQTodSs44ouPdDgLkR.jpg", "actors": ["Lenny Kravitz (Himself)", "Phil Vischer (Himself)", "Michael W.
