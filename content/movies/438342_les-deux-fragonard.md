He was a painter during the final decades of the French monarchy. In this story, he and his brother Cyprien (Robin Renucci), who is an early pioneer in medical anatomy (he dissected corpses and made drawings of what he found in them), have fallen in love with the same woman, Marianne (Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu), a laundress. This attraction has not escaped the notice of Salmon d'Anglas (Sami Frey), a conniving nobleman, who has his heart set on getting revenge on Jean-Honore (Joachim de Almeida) for refusing his patronage and becoming the darling of the French court.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wK2DzRjOwGTkfkRv8MEp8ntuWK9.jpg", "actors": ["Joaquim de Almeida ()", "Robin Renucci ()", "Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu ()", "Sami Frey ()", "Jean-Louis Richard ()", "Philippe Cl\u00e9venot ()", "Nada Strancar ()", "Roland Amstutz ()", "Mich\u00e8le Oppenot ()", "Pierrick Mescam ()", "Christiane Cohendy ()", "Sandra Faure ()", "Marc Rosenstiehl ()", "Jean-Pierre Bagot ()", "Fran\u00e7ois Chattot ()", "Judith Magre ()", "Christine Fersen ()", "Isabelle Nanty ()", "Josiane Stol\u00e9ru ()", "Jos\u00e9phine Fresson ()", "Jean-Jacques Scheffer ()", "G\u00e9rard Hardy ()", "Diane Pierens ()", "V\u00e9ronique Choquet ()", "Christine V\u00e9zinet ()", "Nathalie B\u00e9cue ()", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Charbonneau ()", "Marianne Groves ()", "Claire-Marie Magen ()", "C\u00e9line Samie ()", "Caroline Simonet ()", "Max Roire ()", "Louis-Marie Taillefer ()", "Marief Guittier ()", "Vincent Filliozat ()", "Bernard Kudlak ()", "Michele Sigal ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
