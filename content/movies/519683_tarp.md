Tarp represents my interest in more simple/basic visual themes: Color, shape, and \u201cfound object\u201d filmmaking. I began \u201crecording\u201d all of the tarps in my immediate neighborhood and surrounding cities \u2013 tarps over cars and boats and campers, tarps as tents, on trucks and hanging from overpasses on freeways. The fragmented result still maintains a dream-like tone, yet speaks about the mysterious way we Americans cover-up and protect things and the strange locations in which we do it.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
