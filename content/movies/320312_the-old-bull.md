Thelma lets Zazu drive. When she brakes to avoid a bull pulled along by three rustics, her foot gets stuck and the car crashes through a barn. The barn's owner won't let them leave without paying damages. The gals hoof it, walking in a large circle to arrive back at the farmer's house after dark. While outside his door, they hear a radio broadcast to beware a lion escaped from a wintering circus. Can Thelma and Zasu reclaim the car while avoiding the angry farmer, his prize bull, and the renegade lion?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Zasu Pitts (Zasu)", "Thelma Todd (Thelma)", "Otto Fries (Mr. Bailey - Farmer)", "Bobby Burns (Farm Hand (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
