From re-enacting the arrival of the First Fleet and the birth of John Macarthur's wool-producing enterprise, the film then turns to the present, focusing on rural production, industrial efficiency and the splendid urban landscape of Sydney. As the introductory title grandly proclaims: \"From so small a beginning has sprung the virile Australian Nation.\" Frank Hurley, at the peak of his fame as a photographer, film maker and adventurer, was the obvious choice to direct the film and he delivered spectacular imagery and patriotic commentary with gusto.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5Cdy5ByOF4J3tOUo6LIxSZTjm7J.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
