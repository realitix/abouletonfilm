Jacob (Gottfried John), from Hamburg in West Germany, falls in love with Elisabeth (Angelica Domr\u00f6se) in East Germany. When they secretly meet in East Berlin, it seems the Stasi (secret police) knows about it. When Jacob visits her village, someone informs on him and he is deported. Elisabeth knows who begrudges her this love and takes her revenge. Critics note that in this film, director Heiner Carow revisits the themes of his 1972 smash hit, The Legend of Paul and Paula, which became a cult film throughout Germany.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uVFrTXIOBHwhzA7ihtbnsRCfBZW.jpg", "actors": ["Angelica Domr\u00f6se (Elisabeth Bosch)", "Gottfried John (Jacob Alain)", "Dagmar Manzel (Regina Bosch)", "Katja Paryla (Lilo Utikal)", "J\u00f6rg Gudzuhn (Reimelt)", "G\u00fcnter Schubert ()", "Dirk Kummer ()", "Christine Harbort ()", "Gertraud Kreissig ()", "Erika Stra\u00dfburger ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
