Unaware, they have unleashed the cursed warrior(halimaw) character in the book upon reading. The bloodthirsty demon went on a killing spree in the darkness of night. Discovering that the murders were done by the halimaw in the book, Kokoy, the protagonist, must act fast to put an end to the unwanted trespasser and protect his home and family. Subsequent to this is a variant story of an ancient jar which dated to a period when the dead were buried in jars. This particular jar was cursed as, a lady believed to be, a witch was killed and buried in it. The witch(halimaw) pledged vengeance in her awakening, thereby freeing her spirit gradually from the jar as it traps anyone who unluckily chances upon the jar.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yhZi0f7Y6AM3G6wSfgkjvJhljr4.jpg", "actors": ["Ian de Leon (Cocoy)", "Gina Pare\u00f1o (Mommy)", "Michael De Mesa (Arganox)", "Liza Lorena (Margarita)", "Lotlot De Leon (Toni)", "Mario O'Hara (Abe)", "Mary Walter (Lola)", "Nora Aunor (Regina)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
