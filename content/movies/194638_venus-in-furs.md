He falls asleep while reading \"Venus in Furs\" and dreams of Venus herself, speaking to him in poetry while he caresses her feet and waits on her as a servant. He also stares at women on the subway and imagines kissing and making love to them. After spending his day waiting on beautiful flirtatious women on his knees, he picks up Marna, a mysterious woman in the library, who invites him to her secluded mansion to join her assorted other guests for a weekend of sensual depravity.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hFYvKW5vywG7OXlJ8JJh2EgqlaK.jpg", "actors": ["Barbara Ellen (Marina)", "Shep Wild (David)", "Yolanda Signorelli (Lorile)", "Joseph Marzano (Guy on Bed)", "Janet Banzet (Woman on Subway)", "Bhob Stewart (Screaming Fetishist)", "Bella Donna (Woman with Muscle Man)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
