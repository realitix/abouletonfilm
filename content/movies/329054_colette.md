Yannick Bellon\u2019s captivating postmodernist film, as much a study of evanescence as any poem by Dickinson, segues into the film that Colette, a few years before her end, has just said she doesn\u2019t want to do. Giving voice(over) to her own commentary, she goes back, first, to the home in Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye, Yonne, where she was born.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/90QV95qg9fGxgry67otTIGEDYQv.jpg", "actors": ["Colette ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
