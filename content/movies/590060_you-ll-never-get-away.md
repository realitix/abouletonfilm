Situations progress from 'deadpan' to funny to  ludicrous as she refuses to have him buried and upholds their routines  while he decomposes. James Coco as a beleaguered coroner  and Hayley  Mills as the hipster-next-door who complains of a 'nasty odor' shine.  May penned the piece in one evening as a parody of LOVE STORY, and the  notorious score of YOU'LL NEVER GET AWAY--Smithee's idea--is actually  the score of LOVE STORY played upside down and backwards.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Diane Keaton ()", "Hayley Mills (The Neighbor)", "James Coco (The Coroner)", "Bud Cort ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
