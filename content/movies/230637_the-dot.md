The words of her teacher are a gentle invitation to express herself. But Vashti can\u2019t draw - she\u2019s no artist. To prove her point, Vashti jabs at a blank sheet of paper to make an unremarkable and angry mark. \"There!\" she says.  That one little dot marks the beginning of Vashti\u2019s journey of surprise and self-discovery. That special moment is the core of Peter H. Reynolds\u2019s delicate fable about the creative spirit in all of us.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fLMJlv47sYHib5TQwnxDr2GCzMJ.jpg", "actors": ["Thora Birch (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
