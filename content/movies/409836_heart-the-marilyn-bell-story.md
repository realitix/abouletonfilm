She won the Toronto Canadian National Exhibition prize after Florence Chadwick, a then-famous American swimmer who was widely expected to win, dropped out in the middle of the race. Half of this heart-warming movie is devoted to the 21 hour swim in which the 16-year old Bell is exhorted by her pushy coach Gus Ryder not to give up.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n3I0QMLfmw6jDioMiS8yqE0fvXr.jpg", "actors": ["Caroline Dhavernas (Marilyn Bell)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
