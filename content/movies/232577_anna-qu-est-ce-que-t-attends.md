Edison envisaged combining the phonograph with motion pictures even before they had been perfected and there is a test sequence from 1895. By the time this 'phonoscene' had been made, Alice Guy had been directing a series of them and there was a series in production in Germany, too. Yet true synchronization remained a problem, what with records wearing out and film breaking until the perfection of sound on film itself.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Fragson (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
