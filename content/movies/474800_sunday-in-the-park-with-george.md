The musical begins with the story of George and his model and lover Dot. As George struggles to find his artistic voice, he becomes more and more distant from the one woman who truly sees him for who he really is. A century later, George and Dot\u2019s descendants, themselves struggling artists, grapple with the same issues of artistic ingenuity, and a public who just doesn\u2019t understand.Through melodic and heartbreaking music, poetic lyrics, and quick, jaunty wit, Sunday in the Park with George reveals universal truths about the nature of art, love, and passion, with the breadth and depth of art\u2019s most enduring masterpieces.  Filmed live at the Ch\u00e2telet in Paris in 2013 and broadcast on Mezzo.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bvz6376eDJNRDjsIJv639Oecmj9.jpg", "actors": ["Julian Ovenden (Georges / George)", "Sophie-Louise Dann (Dot / Marie)", "Rebecca de Pont Davies (Old Lady / Elaine)", "Jessica Walker (Nurse / Harriet)", "Nickolas Grace (Jules / Greenberg)", "David Curry (Soldier / Redmond)", "Rebecca Bottone (Celeste 1 / Betty)", "Francesca Jackson (Celeste 2 / Billy)", "Beverley Klein (Yvonne / Blair)", "Nicholas Garrett (Boatman / Dennis)", "Damian Thantrey (Franz & Randolph)", "Jonathan Gunthorpe (Louis / Homme / Alex)", "Christine Buffle (Frieda / No\u00e9mie)", "Elisa Doughty (Mrs)", "Scott Emerson (Mr)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
