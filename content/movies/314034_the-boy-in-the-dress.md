Dennis feels different - an ordinary boy in an ordinary house in an ordinary street, playing football with his mates and living with his dad and brother, but frustrated by the boring grey world he inhabits. Life has never really been the same since his mum left.  However, transformation can happen in the most unexpected places. Aided by Lisa, the coolest girl in the school, Dennis creates a whole new persona and puts it to the ultimate test - but can a boy wear a dress, and what will the headmaster, his dad and his friends on the football team think if they find out?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kaG84vtBEmJx9xY5Ud1ZYZxOBjd.jpg", "actors": ["Billy Kennedy (Dennis Sims)", "Jennifer Saunders (Miss Windsor)", "Tim McInnerny (Mr Hawthorn)", "Meera Syal (Jaspreet)", "Steve Speirs (Peter Sims)", "David Walliams (Referee)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [245739, 152347, 57558, 39307], "youtube_key": "xrBQXxu5Qy8"}
