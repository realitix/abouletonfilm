By gathering together to get their hair done, share stories, and support one another, they find a way to rebuild their lives. The documentary-which was work-shopped at the Salon over the course of four years-is also part of the recovery process, and the subjects of the film played an active part in shaping their own narratives and determining their unique individual styles.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ulEa6aOJwy6QCEAw8jcEx4kMOa6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "rOxs30yqplo"}
