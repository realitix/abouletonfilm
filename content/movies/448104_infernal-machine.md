After their first encounter, Holden's attempt to return Green's thought-to-be stolen purse ends up rendering him a stowaway on board a ship bound for America. Also aboard is a collection of characters, including Green's banker fianc\u00e9, a famed scientist, and an opera singer. Romance begins to blossom between Holden and Green, just as a radiogram claims that an \u201cinfernal machine,\u201d or bomb, is aboard the ship. Quickly each passenger accuses the others of planting the bomb until eventually Holden, jealous of Green's attention to her undeserving fianc\u00e9, falsely admits to being the culprit.  In his role as assumed perpetrator, Holden tests the group further.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qRr4XX5VpUhvfqdHcqpSLbD8hNd.jpg", "actors": ["Chester Morris (Robert Holden)", "Genevieve Tobin (Elinor Green)", "Victor Jory (Alfred Doreen)", "Elizabeth Patterson (Elinor's Aunt)", "Edward Van Sloan (Professor Gustabve Hoffman)", "Josephine Whittell (Mme.
