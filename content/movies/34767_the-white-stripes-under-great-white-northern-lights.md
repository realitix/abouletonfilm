Besides playing the usual venues they challenged themselves and played in buses, caf\u00e9s and for Indian tribal elders. Music video director Emmett Malloy followed the band and managed to capture both the special tour, extraordinary concert versions of the band's minimalist, raw, blues-inspired rock songs and the special relationship between the extroverted Jack White and the introspective Meg White - a formerly married couple who for a long time claimed to be siblings. The film makes striking use of the band's concert colors: red, white and black.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sZUxoFhhZsyU2bk3d22KmgmYSrK.jpg", "actors": ["Jack White (as himself)", "Meg White (as herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [51444, 61445, 57573, 22492], "youtube_key": "eYGt3i1DjFA"}
