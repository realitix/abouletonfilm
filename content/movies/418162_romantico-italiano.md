Cinema within cinema, like an endless Russian doll. Shot during the last Mar del Plata Film Fest, the film\u2019s images range from close-ups of the woman giving a ghostly interview to her love flings as she goes through the city sharing her experiences. A great compilation of the things driven by the experience of watching, making, and feeling films, either from inside or outside of it, as protagonists, directors, or spectators.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mww1kwOrqcZ14RNwa8S2auH3MDB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
