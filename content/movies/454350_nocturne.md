It takes place in a suburb populated by children playing and indistinct parental figures. The narrative plot might suggest that it was a boy's night-time plays; The flashes of a torch in a dark room evoke fights and aerial bombardments. An impression of hostility and a feeling of horror interferes in all the movements ... The fantasy is tinged with nightmare, a storm of repressed emotions hides behind the calm facade of this house. In Nocturne, found footage blends so well with the threat that its perception produces a discharge from the unconscious.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h69toHsEmevixubE1qff4ktcrJq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
