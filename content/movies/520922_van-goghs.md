He's 52, but personal and professional success has escaped him. Many years ago, Mark moved from his native Riga to Tel Aviv to get away from his oppressive father, Viktor, who still supports him financially. Victor Ginzburg is a famous conductor. His work is his life. He never cared about Mark's feelings and tried to mold his son in his own image. Their highs and lows turned long ago into a love-hate relationship. More hate than love. Father calls his son by his childhood nickname Birdie, which infuriates the son. Son calls his father Your Majesty, which infuriates the father. After Viktor is diagnosed with a fatal illness, the father and son set off on a difficult journey that leads from hate to love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/476lNCwVI9efucQFrGAJFMAede8.jpg", "actors": ["Aleksey Serebryakov (Mark)", "Daniel Olbrychski (Viktor)", "Yelena Koreneva (Irina)", "Polina Agureyeva (Masha)", "Aleksandr Sirin (doctor)", "Natalya Negoda (Tanya)", "Svetlana Nemolyaeva (Toma)", "Olga Ostroumova (Lyudmila Vasilyevna)", "Evgeniy Tkachuk (young Viktor)", "Avangard Leontyev (Veniamin)", "Anna Kamenkova (Masha's mother)", "Sergei Dreiden (Masha's grandfather)", "Yola Sanko (Valentina Prokofyevna)", "Saveliy Kudryashov (Viktor in the childhood)", "Igor Pronin (Seva)", "Larisa Udovichenko (Svetlana)", "Dainis Gr\u016bbe ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
