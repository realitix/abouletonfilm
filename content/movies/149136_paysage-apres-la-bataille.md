Men are trying to grab food, change clothes, bury their tormentors they find alive. Then they are herded into other camps as the Allies try to devise policy to control the situation. A young poet who cannot quite find himself in this new situation, meets a headstrong Jewish young girl who wants him to run off with her, to the West. He cannot cope with her growing demands for affection, while still harboring the hatred for the Germans and disdain for his fellow men who quickly revert to petty enmities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z3knr1I9xBjvDnBogEPg12ITeDL.jpg", "actors": ["Daniel Olbrychski (Tadeusz)", "Stanislawa Celinska (Nina)", "Aleksander Bardini (Profesor)", "Tadeusz Janczar (Karol)", "Zygmunt Malanowicz (ksiadz Redaktor)", "Mieczys\u0142aw Stoor (Chorazy)", "Leszek Drogosz (Tolek)", "Stefan Friedmann (Cygan)", "Jerzy Oblamski (Wiezien)", "Jerzy Zelnik (American Commander)", "Malgorzata Braunek (German woman on bicycle)", "Anna German (American)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [396485, 121455, 78786, 29828], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
