After the contest, Taylor will likely be getting a promotion to a position in another city. The firm teams her up with Isabelle, a renowned French pastry chef with whom Taylor instantly locks horns. When Isabelle backs out, Taylor stumbles into a local bakery and meets Adam, a baker and single dad. In an act of desperation, Taylor convinces Adam to partner with her for the contest, arguing that winning would give the bakery and his designs much-needed exposure. For years Taylor has been resistant to call anywhere \u2018home\u2019 for fear it will only be temporary. But the time she spends with Adam and his daughter in their cozy home, decorating for the holidays and exploring the town at Christmas, fills her with a longing for a place to call home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6AayxzjY5n8f8mgV2aHS4kKuDWR.jpg", "actors": ["Duane Henry (Adam)", "Tia Mowry (Taylor)", "Jocelyn Ott (Wendy)", "Melody Niemann (Brooke)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
