Starting out as healthy athletes (or so they thought!), 10 individuals embark on a six-week experiment of continuing their typical training and racing regimen, but with one major difference: they are drinking a quart of green smoothies every day.  You'll be astonished at the results that begin to emerge. From a decrease in injuries to feeling supercharged to run for hours on end, there might be a bit more to smoothies than just tasting delicious.  If you like to exercise, you need to see this film!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qUb6hkYokF7nZEAMd9v5vYrlD5Z.jpg", "actors": ["Sergei Boutenko (Himself)", "Geoff Houghton (Himself)", "Ross Pelton (Himself)", "Jennifer Slawta (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "UNKdVBJAJO8"}
