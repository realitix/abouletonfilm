But the site manager has no idea who to thank \u2013 one thing is for sure; her jealous husband, Ander, is not the unknown cavalier. As these gallantries increase, always on a Thursday and always with an anonymous sender, Ane\u2019s life takes on a new direction. The life of Lourdes is also sent into turmoil by beautiful bouquets of flowers: Since the death of her husband in a traffic accident, flowers have been deposited regularly at the scene. Lourdes\u2019 mother-in-law, Tere, is determined to get to the bottom of the anonymous flowers. Jon Gara\u00f1o and Jos\u00e9 Mari Goenaga\u2019s feature film debut pays charming homage to three headstrong women and the power of flowers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aA1jPEHTCkahDWzfc3KhJg18BFg.jpg", "actors": ["Josean Bengoetxea ()", "Itziar Aizpuru ()", "Itziar Itu\u00f1o ()", "Nagore Aranburu ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [63596, 228719, 517207, 37405], "youtube_key": "HwIv_3GTYbo"}
