Diamond Fuyu is less ethical, and allows the idiotic Tetsu to trick a schoolgirl he fancies, Hanako, into a type of bonded prostitution. Because of gang conflict, the Izu family (to whom Katsuta belongs) has their last gambling den taken over, and he seeks revenge. This brings him back into contact with a former lover who is also a card trickster - she is also Diamond Fuyu's sister, and is now married to Okaru-Hachi, who has mastered a clever card cheating trick called Okaru, which involves the deft use of mirrors.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7Ye9dH5iXLy4AT55QBlvU259xrK.jpg", "actors": ["Akira Kobayashi (Katsura)", "Chieko Matsubara (Tokiko)", "Daizaburo Hirata (Daiyamondo no Fuyu)", "Hiroko It\u00f4 (Mrs. Hachi (Katsura's lover))", "Chikako Shin (Ishikawa Matsue)", "Sanae Nakahara (Yamada Hanako)", "Kaku Takashina (Yakami)", "Eimei Esumi ()", "Ichiro Kijima ()", "Keisuke Noro ()", "Hiroshi K\u00f4no ()", "Kazuo Kinugasa ()", "Hiroshi Ch\u00f4 ()", "Keiko Sasaki ()", "Shir\u00f4 Yanase ()", "K\u00f4ji Seyama ()", "T\u00f4ru Sumikawa ()", "Akira Hisamatsu ()", "Hiroshi Takao ()", "Shiro Tonami ()", "Hiroshi Chiyoda ()", "Terue Shigemori ()", "Masako Urushizawa ()", "Kiyoshi Matsuoka ()", "Y\u016bnosuke It\u014d ()", "T\u00f4ru Abe ()", "Kinz\u00f4 Shin ()", "Taiji Tonoyama ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [42721, 39506], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
