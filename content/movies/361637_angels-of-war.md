Caught up in a war they could not understand or influence, they had no choice but to obey whoever held the gun. Their homes were bombed. They starved as refugees in the bush. They were conscripted as carriers. They fought as infantrymen and guerillas. In Japanese-held areas, they were forced to collaborate or risk execution; some were later hanged for treason by the Australians.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s2Nv5QvY1I1W3QjRHbqs9I7np7N.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
