Matsuzaki (Eiji Okuda) is a racing tipster for a sports paper, a lowlife who spends half his time drunk, hangs out with yakuza and other riff-raff and complicates his sex life by succumbing to advances from his girlfriend's sister. As played by Okuda, he's also a figure of considerable hangdog charm. Less a plot-based movie than a guide to the several forms of high stakes gambling in Japan, this centres on his attempt to help a friend swindled in a bent mahjong game.  Hakuryu appears (memorably) as an inscrutable yakuza in a black leather jacket. The film's success led to two sequels.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fy1HTtivXLFULXTomSuIFAHsAjt.jpg", "actors": ["Eiji Okuda ()", "Hakuryu ()", "Ren Osugi ()", "Toshiyuki Kitami ()", "Maiko Kawakami ()", "Reiko Ikegami ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
