A small yellow light transforms one of the monsters. Scared of this unknown transformation, the other two monsters resist the same fate. But as the second monster is also transformed by a mere touch by the previously transformed monster, the third monster may not be able to resist the fate of his two comrades, as hard as he tries to escape from also being transformed.
