The Swiss, born in 1928, created more than thirty fonts, including the world-famous M\u00e9ridien, Univers and Frutiger type families. Less well-known are his extraordingary freely conceived works. This film is a straightforward, sensitive portrait of the designer and his work which presents Adrian Frutiger's achievements and his relationship to nature in a new way. All the cinematography is done in High Definition, stills of the well-known Swiss cameraman Pio Corradi and the music composed by famous Swiss songwriter Hanery Amman add to the very personal portrait.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7YVfE7R7kKqHKjCcBlhpuznZPTF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
