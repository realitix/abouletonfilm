Davey\u2019s father whips him with a belt for saying that he saw a bear, though he really did see a bear, while his sister looks on in glee. His dog Goliath, actually a leopard-skin footrest with a grotesque tail, tries to help but gets whipped too. Oedipal dream sequences and Davey\u2019s revenge are also highlights in this unforgettable and darkly hilarious suburban nightmare.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hslaEEj1CHFtzd3O8UDyvkoCUut.jpg", "actors": ["Todd Adams (Davey)", "Salvador Barone (Dad)", "Susan Norman (Sally)", "Emma Strahs (Mom)", "Melissa Gardner (Shirley)", "Todd Haynes (Randy)", "Julia Haltigan (The Bear)", "Cyril Autun (Goliath (voice))", "Rob LaBelle (Dad (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
