What he finds is a complicated mix of tragedy and inspiration in the various ways climate change is affecting our value systems. How to Let Go of the World delivers a sobering portrait of the state of climate change, and takes stock of what makes humans survivors, and our societies so creative and resilient.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eZEOvacyC5Bfl7eX1D5umNr8E8R.jpg", "actors": ["Bill McKibben (Himself)", "Tim DeChristopher (Himself)", "Van Jones (Himself)", "Ella Chou (Herself)", "Michael E.
