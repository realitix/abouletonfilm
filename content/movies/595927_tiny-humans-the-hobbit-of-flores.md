A full-grown adult would have been as tall as an average four-year old child today. Researchers believe this ancient race lived at the same time as modern humans, sharing the earth for at least 80,000 years. National Geographic delivers the world's first in-depth documentary of this groundbreaking find.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cQvfpAP0rgmP7qnpErS292sEBjg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
