When the stranger tries to make a run for it, a fight ensues between the two men, and they accidentally tumble down several flights of a concrete stairwell. One hurried ambulance ride later, the copywriter finds himself in a private teaching hospital equipped with the latest gleaming gizmos. Meanwhile, a young internist (Hiroko Yakushimaru) girds herself for her first emergency room case -- the battered copywriter. After giving a curt bow and a nervous \"Good Evening,\" she accidentally jams a syringe into his bloody wound. Soon the absurdity of their situation, along with their medical misery, binds the two men and their blundering nurse together.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kVBwlJDdQ46s5ZyPPO91lRN2Krz.jpg", "actors": ["Hiroyuki Sanada ()", "Hiroko Yakushimaru ()", "Yasuo Daichi ()", "Keiko Saito ()", "Atsumi Hiraguri ()", "Tsuyoshi Ihara ()", "Yoshihiro Kat\u00f4 ()", "Toshinori Omi ()", "Kyusaku Shimada ()", "Yukijiro Hotaru ()", "Eisuke Tsunoda ()", "Bengaru ()", "Chu Arai ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
