Meanwhile, Popeye, with a boat full of \"spinach fer Britain\", rams into the sub by accident. The sub cuts Popeye's ship in half with machine-gun fire, separating him from the spinach; it then sends a torpedo into the remains, which Popeye collects in a rowboat. Popeye spins the sub upside down, then ends up in a mine field.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aD0zwnm8MAxQw7SIfB4NdE7SkX8.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Mercer (Popeye)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
