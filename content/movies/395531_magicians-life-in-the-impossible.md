In this utterly charming showbiz chronicle, four stellar magicians will amaze even the staunchest of skeptics. But for each of these virtuosos, true success seems illusory. Among them: Brian Gillis was Johnny Carson\u2019s favourite close-up magician and a regular on The Tonight Show; David Minkin can levitate almost anything with his mind; and Jon Armstrong might be the best card trickster in the world\u2014but none of them are satisfied. Each can captivate a crowd, but how long can they chase their dreams and at what cost? Following the artists on and off the stage, Magicians: Life in the Impossible captures the sacrifices, the obsessive drive, and the very real possibility of losing everything for the one true love of their lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1ldin8HpIDjDpCyXVcWsFTFf5pR.jpg", "actors": ["Jon Armstrong (himself)", "Brian Gillis (himself)", "David Minkin (himself)", "Jan Rouven (himself)", "Frank Alfter (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [173165, 381080, 390409], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
