The woolly mammoth, the dire wolf, the saber-tooth cat and others disappeared as a result of severe climatic changes that engulfed the planet. And yet other animals persevered. Today, they go on in dwindling numbers as the last of the Ice Age survivors. Scientists are piecing together their past while others work to safeguard the future of these living relics. Despite climate changes over the past 15,000 years and human predation, their descendants persist in a few unspoiled regions of the globe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AgRccjwGuxAQgN3BKzUb3JhtFxO.jpg", "actors": ["Armand Assante (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
