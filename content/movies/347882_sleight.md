Would personally recommend you give it a go._"}, {"pseudo": "Vulco1", "content": "I saw this movie last year when it came out. I thought it was very cool and a nice take on the superhero origin story, along with \"young black man makes it out of the ghetto\" story.  Not very believable towards the end, but the acting and the rules they established earlier on made it work.  \r\n\r\nAll the actors in here were great and the movie looked very good too."}], "recommandations_id": [429733, 341006, 405775, 386825], "youtube_key": "lVAwc1Ll7t4"}
