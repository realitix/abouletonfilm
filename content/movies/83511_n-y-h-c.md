Drawings its roots from punk rock, hardcore evolved into a dedicated, self-contained movement, unconcerned with success in the mainstream. The documentary follows seven bands in the summer of 1995, ranging from Bronx inner-city youth to Long Island suburbanites to Hare Krishna devotees. N.Y.H.C. is a surprisingly in-depth and non-exploitive look into a vital and often neglected music community.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pyMy4fvGVFAzsRmXgd7vhpLGNq4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
