FAR END OF THE MILKY WAY is a trip to the periphery of society. Wealth and jobs are scarce around here, but people want to stay regardless. With stubbornness and a sense of humor, they make the best of their situation. FAR END OF THE MILKY WAY is a film about work and love, your garden as your pub, ashes in the snow and slaughtering pigs", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sePNath3jjVd6TS4tdlgqdA3BzX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
