That is the so-called \u00abBalkan\u00bb. Today the \u00abBalkans\u00bb stand for a Europe that hardly exists elsewhere. The mountains of Montenegro harbour one of Europe's last primeval forests with trees over 400 years of age. In the difficultly accessible hinterland we find the Tara National Park with the deepest gorge in the Karst Mountains - the 1.300 meters deep Tara gorge. Nearby Lake Skadar is home for 270 species of birds; no other lake in Europe can claim such diversity. Europe's last coastal forest area can be found in Albania and in Bulgaria and Romania huge bat colonies live in the cave-dotted mountains. In Serbia one can cross the \u00abEuropean Sahara\u00bb, a desert covering a surface of 30.000 hectares.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s6P6GvmqTMfEaFsOe5WMcLRQYXp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
