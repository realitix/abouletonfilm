Unique and harsh are their destinies during the  World War I and the revolution, at the opposite fronts of civil war, in 1930s. The victories of the Riflemen, their courage, confidence, pain and tragedy. The authors of the film have been able to save these tales from the relentless flow of time and make everyone realise the role of the Latvian Riflemen in history and nation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bLetx9oXYHL5N8ocVQ2UQkTHz0O.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
