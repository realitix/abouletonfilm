The film is a trenchant, realistic study of the ravages and displacements, socially, physically, and mentally, that are visited upon a once-proud, sensitive, and still highly intelligent woman who is declared mentally incompetent by her children. She is subjected to a hearing, where her blurred responses prompt the judge to put her in a nursing home, and she begins to deteriorate. However, her granddaughter who loves her rouses her back to life and helps her learn how to live again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eOAL0T3od6LGBdQn16rcNhuCPmu.jpg", "actors": ["Bette Davis (Esther McDonald Cimino)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
