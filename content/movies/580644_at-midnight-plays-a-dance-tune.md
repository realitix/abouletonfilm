Sex, drugs, roaming through the night: his life transforms into a bundle of energy, grief and detachment. At the same time, he can\u2019t help thinking of Antoine, the strange neighbor from his youth. Antoine the non-conformist, who was eventually thrown out of his home and ended up on the street. Without putting it into words, Seerden draws an obvious parallel between Antoine and himself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d0genrZEbGYhjt48KWc2tFAzvDd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
