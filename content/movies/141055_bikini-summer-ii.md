In return, the bum teaches them about the real world and helps them start a rock-and-roll band. Meanwhile, the rich family has problems: the husband likes S&amp;M with women other than his wife, while the wife likes to watch a sexy home shopping TV channel. The comedy has a happy ending, of course, with the girls putting on a rock-and-roll concert at the beach. The movie has lots of girls running around in bikinis and French maid outfits.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1sOWjmILLS7rc7AvjKrhCYVgyuB.jpg", "actors": ["Jessica Hahn (Marilyn)", "Maureen Flaherty (Bridget)", "Melinda Armstrong (Venessa)", "Robert Miano (Joshua)", "Richard Arbolino (Harry)", "Michele Conaway (Noreen)", "Brian Cassidy (William)", "Alicyn Sterling (Sandra (as Carrie Bittner))", "Tammy Marcel (Sandy)", "Tracy Dali (Anita)", "Jason Clow (Mark)", "Adrian Yvonne Black (Athena)", "Archie Gibson (Edward)", "Joey Cruz (Jim)", "Patrick Askin (Joe)", "Avalon Anders (Clarice)", "Jeff Conaway (Stu Stocker)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
