She sews the eels on to a sheet, then cuts them away and they fall to the ground. A dilemma. Jayne Parker discovered film as a medium when she was a sculpture student at Canterbury College of Art (1977-80). In early works, objects, performance and gesture were combined by the camera to explore space, duration and the physical body. The images in these early films were both literal and metaphoric, depicting exact events but also creating physical and personal associations for the viewer. Ideas are evoked in images rather than words; ordinary actions are also enigmas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fvUPQzSqUpsfVZjzPvIQnZdEBpn.jpg", "actors": ["Christina Mackie ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
