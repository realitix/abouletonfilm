A film of the show itself. So, when Gary toured those albums around the UK again last year we fixed that mistake and filmed the Liverpool Olympia show on September 16th.  Gary remembers the show this way: \u201cWhen it comes to playing in front of a great crowd who are with you on every beat of every song, this show would be right up there with the best. The crowd were amazing, just an incredible atmosphere for the whole night. But, as a band, I gave up counting how many mistakes we made. I think we gave up accuracy for the sheer joy of running around and having fun. It really was fun though.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/OI524fKHPaGTiPwJ4spnOZblUA.jpg", "actors": ["Gary Numan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
