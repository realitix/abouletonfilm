She\u2019s dropped 5 dress sizes and 3 stone using 30-Second Slim. Personal trainer James Stark created this Short Sharp Slim workout based on the latest science of High Intensity Interval Training. It\u2019s just 30 seconds of sweat, followed by an active rest.  \"Laboratory tests show it burns fat faster than any other form of exercise,\" says James.  Plus, Josie reckons, \"it\u2019s great if you\u2019re a bit lazy like me \u2018cos the hard bit only lasts 30 seconds at a time!\"  Three 20-minute workouts build in intensity from Level 1 to Level 3. In each there\u2019s\u2026  WARM-UP: 4 minutes of easy calorie-burning moves.  MAIN WORKOUT: 12 minutes of fat-burning intervals &amp; moves to tone up the bum, arms and belly.  COOL DOWN: 4 minutes of stretches to lengthen the muscles.  \"Let\u2019s face it I was a real porker,\" says Josie. \"But this did it for me--so go for it. All you\u2019ve got to lose is your love handles!\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/49a2mHvQQA0i2OOwFXV07iauXej.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
