It is a \u201cdocumentary-tale\u201d of how Slovenian society has been disintegrating in an invisible way. The story will unveil a Slovenian Oedipus archetype of the possessive martyr mother type and her relationship with her son, in which she through emotional manipulation, by constantly creating feelings of guilt, burdens her son to such a degree, that he remains dependent on her for the rest of his life. In order to put this relationship to its best use, all Slovenian governing structures have elevated mother figure on the level of a saint and have assigned to it the cultish role. The result of the Slovenian maternal cult is a typical Slovene male, who is pathologically obsessed with his mother.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Martina \u017dmuc Tomori (Herself)", "Tatjana Kne\u017eevi\u0107 (Herself)", "Andrej Perko (Himself)", "Svetlana Makarovi\u010d (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
