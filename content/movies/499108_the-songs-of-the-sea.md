They hear rumors that a Russian ship with a festival talent scout will be arriving in the port of Constanta. The band sets up for a performance at the harbor, in hopes of attracting the scout\u2019s attention immediately upon arrival. A case of mistaken identity leads to a series of complications involving a suitcase, two small-time gangsters, a blonde tourist, and the band\u2019s drummer. This attempt at a plot conforms of course to the conventions of romantic musical comedies, resulting in a film full of song and dance.  With memorable song titles like \u201cYes, I am an umbrella\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s play my guitar\u201d, this Romanian-Soviet co-production is as silly as it is irresistible.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lqjMmvP7HJEBVD8R5GWswJmi7xk.jpg", "actors": ["Natalya Fateeva (Nina)", "Dan Spataru (Michai)", "Ion Dichiseanu (Ganea)", "\u0412\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0443\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
