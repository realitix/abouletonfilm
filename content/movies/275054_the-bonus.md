The team accuses its construction company HQ with artificially reducing the targets, so they can be easily exceeded. It makes the management looks good, yet leads to frequent downtime reducing earnings for common construction workers even with fake bonuses. On a hastily organized meeting the management tries to subdue the \"unruly\" gang leader charging that he cannot know all details. It turned out that Potapov and his team prepared a detailed business analysis, which proved their point. Managers, who had different interests and positions, have to decide how to deal with the real problem leading to unexpected results.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ymUXIESpVmgKlggfIeKNgcIEXY3.jpg", "actors": ["Evgeni Leonov (Vasily Potapov, gang leader)", "Vladimir Samoylov (Pavel Batartsev, managing director)", "Oleg Yankovskiy (Lev Solomakhin, Communist party boss at the company, second-in-command)", "Mikhail Gluzskiy (Boris Shatunov, head of planning department)", "Nina Urgant (Dina MIlenina, economist)", "Armen Dzhigarkhanyan (\u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0424\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)", "Viktor Sergachyov (Roman Lyubaev, safety engineer)", "Leonid Dyachkov (Victor Chernikov, division manager)", "Borislav Brondukov (Alexander Zyubin, foreman)", "Svetlana Kryuchkova (Alexandra, hoistman)", "Aleksandr Pashutin (Oleg Kachnov, gang leader)", "Michael Semyonov (Tolya Zharikov, concrete worker, team's komsomol leader)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [158725, 159996, 103307], "youtube_key": "2bUu7DKo_P4"}
