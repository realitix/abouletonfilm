Photographed by Academy Award\u00ae nominee Ce\u0301sar Charlone (City of God), the film travels from war-torn Eastern Europe to the color and light of South America and is told through the voice of Willer\u2019s father Alfred (as narrated by Tim Pigott-Smith, Quantum of Solace), who witnessed bureaucratic nightmares, transportations and suicides but survived to build a post-war life as an architect in Brazil. As the world struggles with the current refugee crisis, RED TREES is a timely look at a family besieged by war who finds peace across an ocean.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4yqjfwTmDrFrBo1VLkPgV0tmCCM.jpg", "actors": ["Tim Pigott-Smith (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
