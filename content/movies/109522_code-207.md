But they really did a good job with what they had. The story would have been amazing if made on a big budget. The lead actor Tino Struckmann did a great job leading it, solid humor and acting, a little touch of Die Hard humor, he will do great in Hollywood. Great supporting cast and some funny little smart comments with a humor ties it together well."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
