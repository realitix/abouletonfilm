However the port was miles up a well defended  estuary. To deliver an explosive charge big enough to demolish the massive lock gates, an old ship HMS Campbeltown was converted to look like a German destroyer, so as to bluff their way into the heart of the port where it would ram the lock gates.The Commandos were to fan out across the dock to demolish pumps and winding gear to comprehensively deny the dock to the Kriegsmarine for a significant period of time. Under cover of dark the bluff worked well, up to a point, Campbeltown rammed the gates but the Commandos found that the Germans were alert and had great difficulty in reaching their objectives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aPnIIOkP6Uk1wwWps0PjrdNpTC1.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Oldfield (Presenter)", "Tim Saunders (Presenter & Director)", "Andrew Duff (Presenter And Producer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "2T23f3ph8Tk"}
