The specters do a song-and-dance routine from the gay-90's era of show-business. They all fade away at dawn, leaving the mouse and the cuckoo bird less-convinced skeptics than they were before the witching hour.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qGtYhuUNoNtbsER4jwNflxlyJLK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
