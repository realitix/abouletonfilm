Louis Quilico was never quite in that league, and he sounds a bit spread and woofy in places here, but he works hard and effectively to bring Rodrigo to life. Placido Domingo recorded his first Don Carlo, for EMI with Giulini, about 15 years before this production, but he looks and sounds fine here -- in the early 1980's he was doing very good Otellos and Lohengrins too, and Furlanetto, still in his 30's, brings a rich, young voice to an old part and succeeds in making the Grand Inquisitor vocally as well as expressively formidable. Levine brings both weight and energy to the score, and that reading fits well with the overall \"traditional\" design and production -- the Met's wardrobe budget must have been severely taxed, but everybody looks splendid.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kdae1E9tEQc0mLQIvUuetjmlGiQ.jpg", "actors": ["Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (Don Carlo)", "Mirella Freni (Elisabeth de Valois)", "Nicolai Ghiaurov (Philippe II)", "Louis Quilico (Rodrigo)", "Grace Bumbry (Princesa de \u00c9boli)", "Ferruccio Furlanetto (El Gran Inquisidor)", "Betsy Norden (Thibault)", "Julien Robbins (Monje)", "Marvis Martin (Una voz celestial)", "John Gilmore (Conde de Lerma)", "James Levine (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
