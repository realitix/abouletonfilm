But I think that this one can be liked by fans that aren't big fans of hip hop either because it boasts of such great quality and director Ernest Dickerson definitly knows his horrors with plenty of homages to old Italian horror, as well as serving as sort of a NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET in an urban setting.\r\n\r\nSnoop Dogg plays the 'boogeyman' and he does so really well, it was written with Snoop Dogg in mind so it works really well.\r\n\r\nNever aging Khalil Kain has one of the leads, he was also one of the leads in Dickerson's 1992 movie JUICE starring Kain, as well as Tupac Shakur and Omar Epps.\r\n\r\n'Scream Queen' Katherine Isabelle plays his sister, and yeah overall not a whole lot to complain about. It certainly is a whole lot better than the IMDb rating would suggest."}], "recommandations_id": [14033, 49877, 128655, 70024], "youtube_key": "-8Eb2YqU3TY"}
