Director Honda uses this film to ask the question \"What is war?\", showing the human bonds between Japan and America, Japanese military tactics which had little regard for life, and the attitude of Japanese military personnel who treated their actions as if they were just doing a job. This film contains few battle scenes, concentrating instead on the love stories of young officers and female members of the community in this lonely air base.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hLdkOIBEoCzOeJXeqomUiOEcDne.jpg", "actors": ["Ry\u00f4 Ikebe (Captain Wakabayashi)", "Mariko Okada (Sumiko Komatsu)", "Rentar\u00f4 Mikuni (Captain Katase)", "Chieko Nakakita (Michiyo)", "Akihiko Hirata (First lieutenant Noguchi)", "Akemi Negishi (Kimu)", "Akira Kubo (Shimada)", "Y\u00fb Fujiki ()", "Kenji Sahara ()", "Haruo Nakajima (Soldier)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
