THE MAN WHO MADE ANGELS FLY is a poetic story about a master of his craft that has inspired audiences to reflect upon common issues of suffering and the mortal coil. Visionary and un-biographic, imaginary tribute to the puppeteer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/46EsuH47My5ZyfUmAsm5SiSlTqr.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Meschke (Himself)", "Ir\u00e8ne Jacob (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "3_QuFx8YAwk"}
