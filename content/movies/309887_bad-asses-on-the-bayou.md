But it's fairly obvious that the Asian jungle from the stockfootage is not New Orleans where our Bad Asses are at.\r\n\r\nAnyway so yeah expect stockfootage and poor CGI explosions, but also Trejo and Glover poking fun at themselves which is the main reason to still watch it."}], "recommandations_id": [255268, 94380, 262474, 55336], "youtube_key": "OIyriNPGDPQ"}
