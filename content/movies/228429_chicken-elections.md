Reports on the upcoming parliamentary elections drone from the radio while a local traffic policeman tries to teach his old grandmother how to use a mobile phone. Glimpses of this old lady, who lives a lonely life on a remote farm, become the red thread running through the film with its snapshot-like portraits of everyday life in the tiny community. There\u2019s the grocer\u2019s shop the men visit to talk about money and politics. Or the postman who delivers on his moped the ballot papers for the forthcoming elections. The policeman who stops cars as he fancies. The school with a handful of children in the overlarge classroom. The pub in which something approaching merriment occasionally arises. And the recurrent visits to the old peasant woman: Her matter-of-fact inventory of aches and pains delivered to the local doctor, her worries about increasing thievery confided in the village priest.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qf6RDejKW3CDQlPwYFGhxCAobLQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "UiRXyYrrLnE"}
