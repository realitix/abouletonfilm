The young man, now very emotionally distraught, dresses in women's clothes and eventually joins a passing gypsy caravan, who think him a young girl... as well as a kind of seer, or 'rawney'. In time, however, he regains some composure and becomes attracted to one of the gypsy girls, which only leads to problems within the gypsy band, especially when the wounded commanding officer finds him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/re5zrSHH3zdcz1LKNhNVQRv2NZL.jpg", "actors": ["Bob Hoskins (Darky)", "Dexter Fletcher (Tom)", "Zo\u00eb Nathenson (Jessie)", "Zo\u00eb Wanamaker (Elle)", "Timmy Lang (Simon)", "Ian McNeice (The Farmer)", "Gawn Grainger (The Officer)", "Jim Carter (The Soldier)", "Ian Dury (Weazel)", "J.G.
