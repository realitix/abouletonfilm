The fact that these gold bars are emblazoned with \u201c666\u2033 could probably be seen as foreshadowing, but I don\u2019t want to read too much into it. Li advises his buddies to drop the gold back into the lake, as it could mean trouble; perhaps this gold was dropped here for someone else to pick up. Of course, Li\u2019s right, but feisty student Ah Kune (who later appeared in a few Alexander Liu films) goes back on his own and gets the bars. The crooked businessman whom was the gold\u2019s original recipient sends waves of henchmen out to find who\u2019s taken the gold, and so begins one of the most noirish and brutal kung-fu films of the 1970s.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s2prBybcNoBJv6SNqKCY8Ez603U.jpg", "actors": ["Ho Tsung-Tao (Ah Wai)", "Hon Gwok-Choi (Ah Keung)", "Phillip Ko Fei ()", "Wai Lit ()", "Chiu Chi-Ling ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
