If i was Mr. Mahesh Bhatt & someone asked me what is the most satisfying thing that you did in life, I'd say it was making ZAKHM.\r\n\r\nEvery single thing about this movie is top notch be it the story, dialogs, direction, editing, music, songs and the top most - acting. Ajay Devgan, Kunal Khemu, Pooja Bhatt, everyone played their parts to perfection. Even the supporting cast of Ashutosh Rana, Saurabh Shukla, Sharat Saxna, Sonali Bendre and everyone else was equally good.\r\n\r\nThe sensitive topic of communal tension was so beautifully captured in the movie, that I felt ashamed of being a part of the same species that don't hesitate to take someone's life just because they don't share the same religion.\r\n\r\nThis movie has reinstated my belief that faith is bigger than any religion. We just gotta have faith in humanity, otherwise the insanity that resides within all of us will prevail & that will be the end of 'US'.\r\n\r\nI just wish everyone in the world can have the sensitivity towards others faith as Pooja Bhatt's character had in every religion.\r\n\r\nExcellent movie, can be watched by anyone anywhere in the world & be felt moved emotionally!"}], "recommandations_id": [266038, 230435], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
