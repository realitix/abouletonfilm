You'll see the area in Bethany where Jesus went to visit His beloved friends at the house of Lazarus. You'll hear the story and see the traditional place where He raised Lazarus from the tomb. Visit the ancient gnarled monarch olive trees, and hear Dr. Skousen's moving description of Jesus Christ's great suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane. Some of these ancient trees were probably there during the time of Jesus.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xXdS7xeizfdlE9gvKGul5wbfQ30.jpg", "actors": ["Daniel A.
