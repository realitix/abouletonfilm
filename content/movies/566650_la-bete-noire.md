Seventeen-year-old Daniel grew up in foster homes in a rural area and those years contrast with his later youth in Paris. A filmmaker opts to interview Daniel for a documentary on delinquency, and that is how the young man's past and precarious present start coming to light.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nwFJzUnKs6FSAjWWxxw7myghcD1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
