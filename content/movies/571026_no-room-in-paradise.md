Hawaii has the highest per capita homeless population in the nation, and more than half of Hawaii's homeless are unsheltered.  Filmmakers Anthony Aalto and Mike Hinchey of Green Island Films say it's no secret what's driving Hawaii's growing homeless population: A lack of affordable housing and services. The question they set out to answer is why more affordable housing isn't being made available.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pQLl4LJhWgU4ZgzMK6LVHlU5226.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
