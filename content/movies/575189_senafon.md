Seventy. No one knows the exact age, because he was recently found on the beach in Thailand without feelings. Apparently, they robbed the day before - neither money nor documents. The name was learned thanks to the engraving on the old Soviet clock. Ksenophon quickly found himself in new circumstances. Without knowing a word in Thai, he gathered a company of his friends, started a business, but through fragmentary memories his past is oppressed. Looks like he's not what he seems. And where the hell does he know Turkish curses ?!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bJu6QgnTrDaHegDQStg8GfG7VDs.jpg", "actors": ["Mikheil Gomiashvili (Ksenofont)", "Evgeniya Dmitrieva (Irina)", "Vladimir Mishukov (Alexey)", "Evgeny Sangadzhiev (\"Lom\")", "Roza Khairullina (Zima)", "Anastasiya Somova (Katya)", "Polina Pushkaruk (Mila)", "Charay Mueanprayun ()", "Amporn Pankratok ()", "Patchrida Paykaew (Pim)", "Alina Astrovskaya (Lena)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
