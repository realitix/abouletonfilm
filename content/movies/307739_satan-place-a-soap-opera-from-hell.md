But the best story on the tape, \"Too Much TV,\" stars Lisa Hatter as a girl who watches a slasher-movie host on cable all day, figuring out ways to kill her sarcastic mother Sonja Etzel, while we watch B-movie parodies like \"Don't Go Into the Kitchen,\" \"Bathroom Bullies,\" \"Pretty Girl Floyd,\" \"Nursing Home Revenge,\" and \"Missouri Mop Massacre.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zNLnEGdH3IJzaJYaPwkmzovgEXi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
