Featuring the stark and iconic photography of Thrasher Magazine\u2019s Ken Salerno, the film chronicles the rise of several different music scenes in a venue for underground music that traversed the entertainment spectrum; from the comedy of Henny Youngman to Nine Inch Nails, New Order to Nirvana. It is the story of musical champions, underdogs and how hoards of misfit kids found an unlikely home and above all, the freedom and liberation of having complete creative control. - IFF Boston", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1QrE40wN2tZmwOuXc4CD3pcjDjd.jpg", "actors": ["Henry Rollins ()", "Jello Biafra ()", "Ian MacKaye ()", "Jon Stewart ()", "Harley Flanagan ()", "Dean Ween ()", "Milo Auckerman ()", "Rat Skates ()", "Al Jourgensen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
