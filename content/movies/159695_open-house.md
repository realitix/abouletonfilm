We meet Barry (Anthony Rapp, Rent) - the eager-to-please real estate agent desperate to sell a house. There's Debbie and Joel (Kellie Martin, ER and James Duval, Donnie Darko) - two \"Sexy Swipers\" who spend their Sundays making quick love in open houses and then stealing trinkets to put in the next house. Down-on-his-luck jewel thief Dave (Jerry Doyle, Babylon 5) has a broken-down getaway car, so he pretends to be an endocrinologist interested in buying a house. There's Ron and Gloria - a couple of adulterous cops trying to break a big case.
