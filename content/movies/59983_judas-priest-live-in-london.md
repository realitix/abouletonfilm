It was recorded at the legendary Brixton Academy show in London in December 2001. The live show track listing features quite a few songs that haven't been played live for quite a while including Turbo Lover and Desert Plains. On top of that, the DVD features tons of behind-the-scenes material, rare footage, interviews, soundcheck footage, and lots more!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ldureqZsshbo4bUhn6gWSYo2LSP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
