Traditional number DVDs teach children to recite sequences of numbers, but fail to teach math or quantitative reasoning skills. BumbleBee's 123s focuses on the presentation of mathematical reasoning skills. Volume 1 of this two DVD set introduces the numbers 1 to 5 as well as the one-to-one correspondence of an object and number when counting. The second volume of this set introduces numbers up to 10 and helps build logical ordering skills. Both volumes of BumbleBee s 123s include interactive games. This set includes two early learning DVDs. BumbleBee s 123s features a fun cast of kids to provide important peer modeling. Supporting materials including flashcards and posters are available FREE on our Website. The set has a 60 minute approximate running time plus interactive games.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8G68uNUWjlabTC5EuNUXnTBENEz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
