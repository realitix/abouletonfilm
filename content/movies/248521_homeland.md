It became the documentary HOMELAND, the fourth of a series about two Palestinian families he followed since 1974 in \"Land of the Fathers\", \"A Reason to go\" and \"Adios Beirut\". HOMELAND is also a personal film about his motivation, his relationship with the members of the two families who became very close. They are now scattered around the world, unable to return to the homeland. It is also an historical saga about the Palestinian people and their struggle for land and dignity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/irNyaKrumFUl3eEq7XgeEfPYHX2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
