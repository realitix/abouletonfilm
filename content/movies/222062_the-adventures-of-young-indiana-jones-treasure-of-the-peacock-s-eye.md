The war in Europe ends but a new adventure begins for Indy when a mysterious man's dying words, \"The eye of the peacock!\" send him and Remy on a thrilling treasure hunt for one of Alexander the Great's most prized possessions. Pursued by a dangeroud one-eyes man, Indy follows the trail of the diamond from London to Alexandria to the South Seas, where he has a run-in with a murderous band of Chinese pirates. The shipboard battle that ensues is a spectacular display of swords, guns and flying fists. Marooned by the priates on a remote desert island, Indy is captured by savage headhunters, but before they can turn him into a shrunken head and cannibal stew, he is rescued by anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski, and makes a life-altering decision.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nii3UJc08GxkN5qupp1hCnjYLGy.jpg", "actors": ["Sean Patrick Flanery (Indiana Jones)", "Ronny Coutteure (Remy Baudouin)", "Adrian Edmondson (Zyke)", "Jayne Ashbourne (Lily)", "Tom Courtenay (Bronislaw Malinowski)", "Pip Torrens (Howard Carter)", "William Osborne (E.M.
