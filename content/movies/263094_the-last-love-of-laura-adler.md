Laura Adler is a big star of one of these troupes. She is attractive, middle-aged and quite content to spend her days performing obscure theater in her backwater town. One day, however, she learns that she is being considered for a part in a major U.S. film, and, while she is absorbing that news, she has an affair with a young man. Later, when she learns that she has terminal cancer, she decides to spend her remaining days onstage with her theatrical friends and family.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rJnq6ZJxlPdnyZV0SpJ8TN1VlWP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
