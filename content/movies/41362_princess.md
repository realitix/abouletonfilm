As he falls for her innocent charms he discerns that something decidedly peculiar is going on.  \r\n\r\nThe protagonist has the agreeable appeal of Richard Thomas (aka John Boy in The Waltons), albeit taller. But I found it odd how he just rolled with the weird lingo and other things while dating the princess, like the perpetual talk of some mysterious \u201csearcher.\u201d If you can get past that, this is a mildly enjoyable TV fantasy flick with some magic. \r\n\r\nThe noble manner in which William (Pardue) courts the princess is beautiful and heartwarming \u2014 the express opposite of picking up a dubious chick at some sleaze joint. Zehetner is certainly winsome, but doesn\u2019t do much for me personally, but there are worthy females on the periphery. The film\u2019s decent, but limited by its TV budget and inferior to \u201cPrince Charming\u201d (2001).                                        \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hours & 28 minutes and was shot in Toronto.
