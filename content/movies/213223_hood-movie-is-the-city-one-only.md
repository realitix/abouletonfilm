However, neither the workers hired to pursue this project, nor the constant migratory flow that took place from the beginning, fitted in the government\u2019s plan. In 1971, began what was known as the \u201cCampaign to Eradicate Invaders\u201d. The parents of director Adirley Queir\u00f3s were amongst the thousands of people displaced towards Brazilian outskirts, into a suburb that borrowed the campaign initials and was named Ceil\u00e2ndia. Queir\u00f3s, member of the first generation of the \u201cceilandeses\u201d, was \u201can offspring of the contradiction that resulted in being a part of Brasilia without being from Brasilia\u201d. Together with other locals, the director reflects about the history, the transformations, and the future of this place where the hypocritical official jingle \u201cA cidade \u00e9 uma s\u00f3!\u201d is no longer heard.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i0Ks2DIZ0zleHrEzYpBkFJHnPWM.jpg", "actors": ["Dilmar Dur\u00e3es (Dildu)", "Nancy Ara\u00fajo (Nancy)", "Wellington Abreu (Z\u00e9 Bigode)", "Marquim do Tropa (Marquim)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
