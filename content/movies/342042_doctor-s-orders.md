He tells Mickey how he can't get close to the girl of his dreams; he's overheard by Dave, a smooth operator, who insists that Alabam leave everything to him. He contrives to have Alabam and Mickey wreck Alabam's car in the girl's front yard, then he arrives, posing as a doctor, asking the residents of the house if they'll let the injured boy come inside while the doctor examines him. Meanwhile, Mickey gets a look at the girl's cousin and feigns injury so that now both lads are in beds upstairs while Dave, the doctor, conjures foul-tasting treatments. The fly in the ointment is the girl's crusty uncle, who may stand between the lads and their true loves.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["David Sharpe (Dave / Dr. Sharpe / Nurse)", "Gertrude Messinger (Gertie)", "Mary Kornman (Mary)", "Mickey Daniels (Mickey)", "Dorothy Granger (Dorothy, the Maid)", "Grady Sutton (Alabam)", "Edgar Kennedy (Mary's Father / Gertie's Uncle)", "Betty Mae Crane (Introductory Titles Speaker)", "Beverly Crane (Introductory Titles Speaker)", "Tiny Sandford (Cop)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
