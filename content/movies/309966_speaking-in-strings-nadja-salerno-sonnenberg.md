Though widely considered eccentric, wild and unorthodox, this \"bad girl\" performer clearly plays with passion and emotion. Speaking in Strings delicately and lovingly handles her often painful life.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
