Linda, the girl's leader, fears she may be pregnant from her window cleaner boyfriend, an aspiring pop singer.\r Desperate, and unable to confide in her parents, she must wrestle with her conscience and decide what course of action to take.  Meanwhile, a concerned teacher learns the significance of the yellow teddybears, and in trying to help the girls in question, puts her own career in jeopardy.\r While dated and corny in many ways 'The Yellow Teddybears' is interesting as a snapshot of pre-\"Swinging Sixties\" England before The Beatles and The Pill changed young people's lives forever..", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kcPoPc6I3miPaRiXa6eZbLFGKlI.jpg", "actors": ["Jacqueline Ellis (Anne Mason (Teacher))", "Iain Gregory (Kinky)", "Georgina Patterson (Pat)", "John Bonney (Paul)", "Annette Whiteley (Linda)", "Douglas Sheldon (Mike)", "Victor Brooks (George Donaghue)", "Anne Kettle (Sally)", "Jill Adams (June Wilson)", "John Glyn-Jones (Benny Wintle)", "Raymond Huntley (Harry Haliburton)", "Harriette Johns (Lady Gregg)", "Noel Dyson (Muriel Donaghue)", "Richard Bebb (Frank Lang)", "Ann Castle (Eileen Lang)", "Caron Gardner (Carol)", "Shirley Cameron (Gloria)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
