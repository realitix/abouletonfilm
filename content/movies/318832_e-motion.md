That\u2019s the world we live in.  Now imagine a world where everyone is manifesting from their heart the perfect creation that\u2019s inside each of us. Imagine a world where abundance, inner peace, longevity and loving relationships abound. Imagine emotion experts from around the world sharing their wisdom and negative-emotion clearing techniques to light a new pathway for humanity. Imagine we are sacred, spiritual beings here for a much larger reason, serving a much higher purpose, a divine purpose. That\u2019s where we\u2019re going.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zbH2muCfXqlJaYZlBCvkmmEtfJU.jpg", "actors": ["Neale Donald Walsch (Himself)", "Bradley Nelson (Himself)", "Joe Dispenza (Himself)", "Sonia Choquette (Herself)", "Darren Weissman (Himself)", "Nassim Haramein (Himself)", "Don Tolman (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
