She has been going through IVF treatments to get pregnant by her network executive husband (Diedrich Bader), but discovers on her birthday, that her husband has knocked up his younger, skinnier, co-worker (Haylie Duff) and wants a divorce. Happy Birthday! She goes on to find a more authentic version of who she really is, despite the delights of being suddenly single in Los Angeles, where low self-esteem for women is our number one export to the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sDMdEFvCZvUNTYZH9z3AYSwCzEC.jpg", "actors": ["Cathryn Michon (Suzanne Nicholson)", "Marissa Jaret Winokur (Elise)", "Diedrich Bader (Michael Nicholson)", "Jill Holden (Dr. Nadja Borman)", "Haylie Duff (Jessica)", "Jane Morris (Dr. Khalsa)", "Wayne Federman (Hayes Greenberg)", "Michael Hawley (Jarod)", "Melissa Peterman (Kim)", "David Arquette (Cameron Scott)", "Retta (Leah)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
