Little Henery attaches a rope to the cement-laden Foghorn and drags him home for a tough-to-chew chicken dinner.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v2OJoqEhVdccelBctjVhKX0e6Ms.jpg", "actors": ["Mel Blanc (Foghorn Leghorn / Henery Hawk / Barnyard Dog (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
