Crashing into jungles known to be inhabited by head hunters, pilots Bill and Joe race against time to fix the engines and attempt a take off. The situation brings out the best and worst in the stranded dozen as they create a makeshift runway and prepare to escape before the natives attack. But damage to the plane and low fuel reserves means that only 5 people can be carried to safety.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lg5ADlTMjSb6y47JowklE4V0QRr.jpg", "actors": ["Chester Morris (Bill Brooks)", "Lucille Ball (Peggy Nolan)", "Wendy Barrie (Alice Melbourne)", "John Carradine (Mr. Crimp)", "Allen Jenkins (Peter 'Pete')", "Joseph Calleia (Vasquez)", "C.
