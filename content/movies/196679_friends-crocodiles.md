He persuades Lizzie Thomas, a secretary at a local estate agent's, to come and work for him as his assistant, to bring some order to his chaos. He inspires her with his enthusiasm and imagination, and frustrates her with his apparent carelessness and destructiveness, which culminates in her calling the police as one of his parties is attacked by local troublemakers, seemingly with his tacit approval.  But their paths are destined to cross again and again as Lizzie, with the help of some of the people that she met at Paul's house, rises through the changing landscape of corporate Britain. This is the tale of a meaningful and powerful relationship that isn't a love story; it's about those rare people who profoundly influence and shape our lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sQWxfwUz8k82tSM1u7ZxIyMx6Vf.jpg", "actors": ["Damian Lewis (Paul Reynolds)", "Jodhi May (Lizzie Thomas)", "Robert Lindsay (William Sneath)", "Patrick Malahide (Anders)", "Eddie Marsan (Butterworth)", "Allan Corduner (Marcus)", "Chris Larkin (Redfern)", "John Warnaby (Coyle)", "Paul Hickey (Albert Brother)", "Tim Plester (Albert Junior)", "Murray McArthur (Soup Man 1)", "Sophie Hunter (Christine)", "Olivia Poulet (Carol)", "Isabel Brook ()", "Harry Melling (Young Oliver)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
