Lassila's early years are briefly shown, then the film richly details his active and paradoxically reclusive adult life, beginning with his sojourn in St. Petersburg, working as a businessman. Unable to stay away from politics, he caused the assassination of a high-ranking Czarist and as a result, had to run back to Finland to hide. Once established in the comparative safety of a small village, he taught school in order to support his real vocation as a writer. Always living on the edge of poverty, if not square in the middle of it, Lassila continues to avoid public contact - he keeps his identity low-key and camoflages it by publishing under a variety of pseudonyms.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tRMgsV6wjQvOsZmqfHSum35tkrb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
