Braun's inspired direction and virtuoso camerawork, along with a bravura performance by Seth Gamble as Mr. Hyde and a tremendous supporting cast including Reagan Foxx, Kenna James, Charlotte Stokely, Victoria Voxxx, jessica drake and adult industry legend Tom Byron as Dr. Jekyll, contribute to making The Possession of Mrs. Hyde a groundbreaking erotic masterpiece.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cIVZAWskFDn5flRqc2nF38AR3Wp.jpg", "actors": ["Reagan Foxx ()", "Jessica Drake ()", "Kenna James ()", "Avi Love ()", "Charlotte Stokely ()", "Victoria Voxxx ()", "Tom Byron ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
