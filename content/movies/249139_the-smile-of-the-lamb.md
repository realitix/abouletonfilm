Military governor Makram Khouri tries to flush out some fugitive PLO activists by hanging the rotting, stinking carcass of a dead donkey in a village square. Israeli doctor Rami Danon forgets his animosity towards the PLO and, out of compassion, cuts the carcass down. For disobeying Khouri's orders, Danon becomes as much a fugitive as the Palestinians. While in hiding, Danon befriends Arab hermit Tuncel Kurtiz, whose adopted son is a member of the PLO.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6kbDAiuHtatuCdMyw2cf7XTzk0v.jpg", "actors": ["Tuncel Kurtiz (Hilmi)", "Rami Danon (Dr. UriLaniado)", "Makram Khoury (Col.
