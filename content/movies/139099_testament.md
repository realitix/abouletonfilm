{"tmdb_id": 139099, "title": "Testament", "original_title": "Testament", "slug_title": "testament", "date": "1974-01-01", "genre": [""], "score": "6.0/10", "synopsis": "\"TESTAMENT is James Broughton's exquisite self-portrait. A major figure in avant-garde filmmaking and poetry since the 1940s, Broughton views his life and life's work with irony, charm, humor, and a combination of joyous self-love and gentle self-depreciation. Scenes from his earlier films mix the elements of humor, magic, slapstick, melodrama, and romance which mark his aesthetic. A plethora of rich personal symbols is woven throughout the film, tied together by verbal games, Zen poems, anecdotes, songs, a child's prayer, dreams, and visions.\" - Karen Cooper \"James Broughton's TESTAMENT is one of the most remarkable films ever produced within the American independent cinema. It is the most moving and most sublimely detached of the recent trend of filmic autobiographies - by Jerome Hill, Jonas Mekas, and Stan Brakhage, to name only the masters, and Broughton's peers.\" - P. Adams Sitney \"A beautiful, important, mysterious work.\" - Amos Vogel", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4J4pJar1VwdNSpz6IbQxilZxLIk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
