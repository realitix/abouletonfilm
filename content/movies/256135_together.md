As if it wasn\u2019t bad enough being infected by HIV, their suffering is compounded by the fact that in the People\u2019s Republic of China the disease is hushed up and people living with AIDS are ostracised. In China, the public at large knows very little about the disease and most people associate the virus with promiscuity. This fear of discrimination forces most patients to hide the fact that they are positive. The AIDS sufferers in Zhao Liang\u2019s film were willing to share their experiences with him. The filmmaker was able to make contact with them via internet support groups; he also visited children with Aids at a \u2018red ribbon\u2019 school; but above all, he talked to AIDS sufferers during the making of Gu Changwei\u2019s film. It is their presence which lends Changwei\u2019s film its particular authenticity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2D9WfeQdfcNnYs9qS800zoPnvuu.jpg", "actors": ["Zhang Ziyi (Herself)", "Aaron Kwok ()", "Gu Chang-Wei ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
