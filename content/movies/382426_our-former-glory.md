The film proposes visual similes between impersonal architecture and the language of mass production that define America's most pervasive global export: a living aesthetic culture of utility. Just as we can conceive of sentimental or spiritual offerings as disposable, so too are we led to identify our selves within that aesthetic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o4De81oSHek83YgQfHoJIuHqqvj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
