The Italian baritone brings a powerful, versatile voice to his role, but also brings his character a hilarious buffo quality. Daniele Gatti, one of the most acclaimed opera conductors working today, leads a stunning cast of singers including Barbara Fritolli as Alice Ford.  Genuinely warm italianita in all of the music-making, combined with a boisterous production by stage director Sven-Eric Bechtolf, turns Verdis commedia lirica into a fireworks display of high spirits as well as what the Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung called musically and dramaturgically a feast of life and of love of life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mUioqImaZskdxDeAfFDf9aEW4yB.jpg", "actors": ["Amrogio Maestri ()", "Barbara Frittoli ()", "Massimo Cavalletti ()", "Eva Liebau ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
