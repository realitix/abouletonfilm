Ace also has his eye on Judy, but Judy only has eyes for Clay. Since Ace is a crook, he holds up the stage and has his cronies swear that Clay was the bandit which gets Clay 10 years in jail. After he gets out in 5 for good behavior, Clay sets out to find who framed him and stole the stage strongbox. Since the sheriff does not like Clay, he takes his guns away as part of his probation and it makes Clay a target for the Ace gang.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k69uSRsQl3qSTh7eP5WHAOzQKCC.jpg", "actors": ["Dick Foran (Clay Brent)", "Patricia Walthall (Judy Ware)", "Emmett Vogan (Ace Cain)", "Glenn Strange (Tex Roberts)", "Smoke (Smoke, Clay's Horse)", "Anderson Lawler (Buck McGovern)", "Wilfred Lucas (John Ware)", "Tom Brower (Dad Brent)", "George Chesebro (Cutter Smith)", "Charles Le Moyne (Tom Raines)", "Edmund Cobb (Sheriff Cal Hardin)", "J.P.
