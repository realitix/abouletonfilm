Miss Andrews and the two Americans cavort in some very funny slapstick, including a \u201cCinderella\u201d take\u2010off of traditional English pantomime.\r Even a tender, dramatic vignette, with Miss Andrews and Mr. Van Dyke in a fogshrouded meeting during World War II, Works appealingly.  The songs flow almost continuously, enhanced by the muscular leaping of the Paddy Stone Dancers, clad as Covent Garden street workers. The ensemble finale is dandy, with a cavalcade of excerpts of songs from American hits at the Drury Lane, from \u201cRose Marie\u201d to \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d Miss Andrews sings as beautifully as ever.  Blake Edwards produced, Dennis Vance directed, and Marty Farrell, Frank Waldman and Dick Hills wrote the program.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eXhihkc0Ii3pvGZyj58SMxDC1dY.jpg", "actors": ["Julie Andrews (Herself)", "Dick Van Dyke (Himself)", "Carl Reiner (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
