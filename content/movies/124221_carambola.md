The first order of business: El Vago enlists the aid of ambitious assistant El Perro (Luna) in shooting an instructional billiards video.

As an impressive array of billiards champs descend upon the pool hall for a high profile tournament, El Mexicano comes into possession of the steamy sex tape and flies into a vengeful fury.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m4wDgfPS1YJvo0oujGXuCBDm87a.jpg", "actors": ["Diego Luna (El Perro)", "Jes\u00fas Ochoa (El Mexicano)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
