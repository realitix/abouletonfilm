Each of the ten classic cover versions has its own particular tale, tied not only into its musical and cultural context but also the personal testimony of the artists, producers and songwriters whose lives were changed in the process.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A6MBKiZN6MI7qYhctkwViIdfpyO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
