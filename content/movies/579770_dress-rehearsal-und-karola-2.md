Her way of dealing with clothes and jewelry, her specific talent of using whatever she wears or touches as a means of self expression, informs the images of both works. But although they were edited out of the same material, even using identical footage now and then, they differ considerably in structure and pace. It is important to see that the films do not attempt to unfold an argument: they are not a statement of any particular feminist issue. What we tried o do while shooting was to concentrate on our own visual pleasure rather than work in opposition to existing stereotypes. the fact that our tastes and needs did not entirely correspond added an element of communicative tension between us. It also added a slight note of incongruity: Karola's creative narcissism and ironic resourcefulnes becomes to me a metaphor for all kinds of mental and actual activities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/goMEGeEKJaJjiE3qd79P2TWzuQ3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
