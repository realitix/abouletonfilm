Take a film like \u2018Incubus\u2019. Just cause the director\u2019s nephew died, the production company went belly up, and Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate attended the premiere....Those could all just be coincidences. Shit happens. But with \u2018Virgin\u2019, you could just smell the vapor of evil clouding the set. It didn\u2019t help that our chief investor was a ranking member of the Church of Satan. In the end, we tallied three OD\u2019s, a maimed-for-life set designer, bankruptcy, and a car bombing (sort of). Even the film itself disappeared. Not just the prints. The film lab burnt down and we lost the negative. All I\u2019ve got left is the nine minute opening to the main feature and the sound-sync is fucked.\u201d \u2014JXW", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/NauuyUisH4ngGzPxq19FWQ687k.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
