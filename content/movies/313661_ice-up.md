The water that once ran from the summits in torrents and waterfalls is immobilized for a few weeks. The thing is to be there, in time, just at the moment when they become solid, just before they return to water. A question of balance. Around seven top-level climbers who represent all the richness of the activity, these images will highlight different techniques and different approaches. Although the athletic performance is impressive, it is there only to emphasize the dazzling shapes, the warmth of friendships, the stories of teamwork.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/38cQICV0MlYdc5X66BFqeidXT1n.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
