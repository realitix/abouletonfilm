Marker went to Israel as an outsider, looking to discover the spirit of the young country through its \"language of signs.\" He found a place whose unique moral and political obligations could provide a new, humane model of nationhood to the world.  In DESCRIPTION OF A MEMORY, director Dan Geva, an Israeli, explores what has happened in his homeland in the years since with a more critical eye, asking whether the promises Marker identified have been fulfilled. Structured by thirteen memories, the film is an open-ended, essayistic meditation on the distance between the ideals that fueled the creation of Israel and the realities of its history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5r02RibOV5QqJKU6iA73ELWWXfN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "bWi6lOxJMuY"}
