On the one hand it's an interesting insight into the shady world of evangelism and the mind of a man who doesn't believe what he's preaching. But the film doesn't really go anywhere or tell much of a story. It just seems like a lot of footage of Marjoe evangelising inter-cut with interviews, all of which ends rather abruptly without making any real point or coming to much of a conclusion."}], "recommandations_id": []}
