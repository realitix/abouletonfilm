With no official documentation they find themselves unable to cover the medical fees and Dorj must pawn their wedding belongings before signing up to a local karaoke contest. A heart- warming and feel-good road movie about the clash between nature and the urban world. Out of Paradise is as much a love story as a reflection on our modern ways of living.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oNnEZxaBINe2Ct9kcs1gmAmrEGR.jpg", "actors": ["Bayarsaikhan Bayartsengel (Dorj)", "Oyun-Erdene Jamiyan (Mother)", "Bayanmunkh Purevjav (Ganbaa)", "Adiyabaatar Rina (Jack)", "Erdenetsetseg Tsend-Ayushh (Saraa)", "Enerel Tumen (Suren)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "318085318"}
