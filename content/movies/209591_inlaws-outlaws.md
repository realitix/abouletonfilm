At the top of the film, we meet a variety of storytellers one on one. We don't know who's gay or straight or who's with whom. As their stories unfold and stereotypes fall by the wayside, love conquers all - and we find ourselves rooting for everyone. With remarkable honesty, good humor, great music and real heart, Inlaws &amp; Outlaws weaves together true stories of couples and singles, gay and straight, to embrace what we all have in common: we love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/itLvfoFWXQA0mX185jaso8Wv07N.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
