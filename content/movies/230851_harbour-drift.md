A sordid tale of poverty and greed set within a quayside milieu of crime and prostitution, the narrative centres on the quest for a sparkling pearl necklace stolen by a beggar under the gaze of a prostitute, who persuades her unemployed friend to steal it back, with tragic consequences. The story unfolds in flashback, without irony or a hint of redemption: life simply goes on. The film is remarkable for the innovative camerawork of Friedl Behn-Grund, which manipulates light and shadow to create a nightmarish atmosphere of fear and premonition.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/paDqdwpuKmNq9vHLA8INyLU5N8Y.jpg", "actors": ["Lissy Arna ()", "Paul Rehkopf ()", "Fritz Genschow ()", "Friedrich Gna\u00df ()", "Sig Arno (Der Hehler / The Receiver)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
