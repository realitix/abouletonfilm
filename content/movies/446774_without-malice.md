To appease his future wife, Paul tries to mend fences with Marty by inviting him along for a camping trip in the Canadian wilderness. While looking for elk, Paul sees a large bear that's heading towards Marty; thinking the animal is about to attack, Paul fires several shots at the bear, but one of them manages to kill a nearby forest ranger on patrol. Afraid that no one will believe the truth -- especially given Marty's past arrest record -- Paul and Marty cook up a fraudulent story to explain the ranger's death, but when park warden Samantha Wilkes (Jennifer Beals) looks into the case, their web of lies begins to unravel, with dangerous consequences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7zpGuNqwQ2BRNyxPA1iMh2vle3l.jpg", "actors": ["Jennifer Beals (Samantha Wilkes)", "Craig Sheffer (Dr. Paul Venters)", "Corey Haim (Marty)", "Gabrielle Anwar (Susan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
