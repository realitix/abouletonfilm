The patient, 15\u00adyear\u00ad old Arlette, doesn\u2019t understand German. Her knee was injured in the war, and unknown wealthy Germans have helped pay for her trip to have surgery in Europe.  The camera follows Arlette on her journey, from her worried family in Central African Republic to the desolate rooms of the hospital and the rehabilitation centre. The girl\u2019s gaze is captivating but impenetrable, and the easily bored teenager surrounded by adult strangers is only cheered up by an interpreter who knows her mother tongue. The story takes a gloomier turn when it transpires that rebel forces have taken up arms in Arlette\u2019s home country.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1j4Nw8TYBAGxEP35fwMLyv1Zlhw.jpg", "actors": ["Arlette Wali-Kette (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
