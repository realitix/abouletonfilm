This film features Terry 'Coyote' Murphy representing the Native American influence of the isle of Manhattan. Coyote, a Shaman Trail Scout, takes a journey which transcends time, weaving from Inwood Park (where the island was traded for beads &amp; booze), down a long native path (now called 'the great white way', more commonly known as 'Broadway'), to the lower reaches of Manhattan into 'ground zero' (which is now a sacred burial ground for not just the American Indian &amp; the slaves of yesteryear, but for the newest natives of this island empire as well).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aTvU5emQJmgNElhqxF4y7csrPc0.jpg", "actors": ["Terry 'Coyote' Murphy (Shaman Trail Scout)", "John 'Pope' Paul (Native Scout)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
