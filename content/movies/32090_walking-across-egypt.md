The film explores the lonely qualities of life for senior citizens after their children leave as adults. Judge Reinhold and Gail O'Grady play Mattie's children who live in a deep southern town.  Mattie soon finds a likable friend in the local dogcatcher, Lamar Benfield (Mark Hamill). It is through this relationship in which she meets the dogcatcher's nephew, a troubled, foul-mouthed, orphaned juvenile delinquent, Wesley (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), currently serving time in juvenile detention for a recent car theft. Mattie finds that this young man is just missing direction and believes that with a little insight on Christianity he can straighten up and fly right.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pFiYtOWQCQvFKQkuOZsecRLIXub.jpg", "actors": ["Jonathan Taylor Thomas (Wesley Benfield)", "Mark Hamill (Lamar N.
