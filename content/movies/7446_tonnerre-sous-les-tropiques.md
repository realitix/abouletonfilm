En t\u00eate d'affiche : Tugg Speedman, la star du film d'action, en chute libre depuis ses trois derniers navets. \u00c0 ses c\u00f4t\u00e9s : Jeff Portnoy, sp\u00e9cialiste des com\u00e9dies (tr\u00e8s) bas de gamme, avide de prouver ses qualit\u00e9s de com\u00e9dien ; Kirk Lazarus, acteur \"M\u00e9thode\" multi-recompens\u00e9 et 100 % givr\u00e9 ; Chino, superstar pop et fan d'Al Pacino ; et Kevin Sandusky, le fringant petit jeune tout heureux de faire partie de la bande. Cinq egos surdimensionn\u00e9s au service du \"plus grand film de guerre de tous les temps\".

C'est alors que Damien a l'id\u00e9e \"g\u00e9niale\" d'entra\u00eener sa petite troupe au c\u0153ur du Triangle d'Or pour une exp\u00e9rience de \"cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9\" d'un genre in\u00e9dit.
