The animation style, while dated, was awesome, and I just fervently wish this sort of thing was still being done. Though I have refused to have cable or watch anything but movies since my son was born in 2003, because to paraphrase 'Network', I 'just wouldn't take it anymore', because I was so perplexed of the huge drop-off in the quality of programming, I know for a fact that TV stations would never have this sort of thing today because they want every available second of spare time for commercials, so that they can make as much money as possible. They couldn't possibly care less about the consumers, their hearts, minds or souls. Anyway, I found this as an extra on my DVD of 'East Side West Side' (which I hope to see soon, I was simply being lazy) from my awesome Barbara Stanwyck TCM 4-pack."}], "recommandations_id": []}
