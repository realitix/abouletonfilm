The (very few) action scenes are a complete mess. The film is basically an over-the-top melodrama and makes very little sense. I was too frustrated to even enjoy the beauty of Cheryl Yang and Annie Wu.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cyt29qfzDtWN5Qg1XKEkFtVAF5Z.jpg", "actors": ["Annie Wu (Porsch)", "Cheryl Yang (Gucci)", "Shu-shen Hsiao (Pigeon (as Liliy Hsiao))", "Yi-Fei Chen (Captain Lee Chun Kwon (as David Chen))", "Chih-kung Tou (Star (as Bobby Duo))", "Alvin Tseng (Ya Yang)", "Shih-Lun Kuo (Pao (as Darryl Kuo))", "May Liu (Solio)", "Gigi Lin (Gigi)", "Tien-Fa Kao (Pigeon's Dad)", "Chien-hui Hsieh (Cheung Lai Wah)", "Anne Huang (Little Pigeon)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
