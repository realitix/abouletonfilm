Sullivan, Saranac Lake, N.Y. 12983.)  \"The Guide\" is the Sullivan family album, a grandiose home movie focused on the days and nights, life and times of \"Adirondack\" Fred. And you thought Molly Dodd was a schlemiel. Fred, the most self-obsessed creature since Garfield the Cat, produces, directs, writes, edits and stars in this offbeat, low-budget work. Fred's four children, Fred's tiresome wife Polly, Fred's business partners, psychiatrist, internist, teachers, neighbors, creditors, sommelier and so forth comment on the 42-year-old ne'er-do-well.  -- Rita Kempley, Washington Post, 10 February 1989 http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/beerdrinkersguidetofitnessandfilmmakingpgkempley_a09fa8.htm", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hSqw5KEF6bkV9n5GS6S7g3qFdsR.jpg", "actors": ["Fred G.
