Not much happens plotwise: Acuff, playing \"himself,\" is a tenderfoot who somehow manages to come out on top when he heads westward. The villains (who aren't all that villainous) try to promote a phony stock deal, but Roy and his pals foils their plans. The comedy honors go to Guinn \"Big Boy\" Williams as a blowhard sheriff. Smoky Mountain Melody was scripted by Barry Shipman, the son of pioneering female filmmaker Nell Shipman.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kz5CkM4HjNRnCh6fMSM4xIakxHf.jpg", "actors": ["Roy Acuff (Roy Acuff)", "Guinn Williams (Saddle Grease Williams)", "Russell Arms (Bruce 'Kid' Corby)", "Sybil Merritt (Mary Files)", "Tommy Ivo (Tommy Durkin)", "Jason Robards Sr. (Josh Corby (as Jason Robards))", "Harry Cheshire (Doc Moffitt (as Harry V.
