Some tough guys from the square have been angry with Albert Zoli, a boxer since he started living a decent life, passed the final examination at high-school, and entered a job as a bank clerk. About his illegal activity, however, they do not even have the slightest idea. With the help of Zsizsi, a young actress, and Diogenes, an extravagant tramp, he persuades the guys to join the movement. They distribute anti-Nazi handbills and paint pacifist slogans onto the walls of houses.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nYy4VUuVx4Nmk3RRRjlegNXga7g.jpg", "actors": ["Darvas Iv\u00e1n ()", "Istv\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs ()", "\u00c1gi Margitai ()", "Zolt\u00e1n V\u00e1rkonyi ()", "Bujtor Istv\u00e1n ()", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Tahi T\u00f3th ()", "P\u00e9ter Huszti ()", "Zolt\u00e1n Latinovits ()", "Hilda Gobbi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
