The great Emil Jannings stars as Mathias Clausen, a self-made businessman who is forced to do a great deal of soul-searching when his wife unexpectedly dies. Determining to start life anew, he falls in love with his secretary Inken (Marianne Hoppe) and impulsively takes a vacation to Italy. Clausen's selfish grown children, not wishing to share their father's affections -- nor his money -- with his new wife-to-be, go to court demanding that Clausen be declared mentally incompetent. Upon finding this out, Clausen flies into a rage, leaving the audience to wonder whether or not he really as gone off his trolley. Der Herrscher was directed by Veit Harlan, more famous (or notorious) for his viciously anti-Semitic Jud Suess (1940).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/70LDb7OVYM2HEJj7xXI9aGbL03i.jpg", "actors": ["Emil Jannings (Matthias Clausen)", "Marianne Hoppe (Inken Peters)", "Hilde K\u00f6rber (Bettina Clausen)", "K\u00e4the Haack (Ottilie Klamroth)", "Herbert H\u00fcbner (Direktor Erich Klamroth)", "Maria Koppenh\u00f6fer (Klothilde Clausen)", "Paul Bildt (Diener Winter)", "Heinrich Schroth (Direktor Hofer)", "Max G\u00fclstorff (Sanit\u00e4tsrat Geiger)", "Harald Paulsen (Rechtsanwalt Hanefeld)", "Paul Wagner (Professor Wolfgang Clausen)", "Hannes Stelzer (Egert - sein j\u00fcngster Sohn)", "Rudolf Klein-Rogge (Direktor Bodlfing)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
