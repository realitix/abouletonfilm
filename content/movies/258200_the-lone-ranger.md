In one of his first actions, he captures and assumes the identity of Texas' new Finance Commissioner, Colonel Marcus Jeffries, after having the real man murdered. When a contingent of Texas Rangers enters the territory, Snead, one of Smith's men, leads them into an ambush by Smith's \"troopers\". The Rangers are apparently wiped out, although one injured survivor is left. The survivor, nursed back to health by Tonto, swears to avenge the massacre and defeat \"Colonel Jeffries\" and his men.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Atw9fAmRuJzZcZDELbUd1i6g30z.jpg", "actors": ["Bruce Bennett (Bert Rogers)", "Lee Powell (Allen King)", "Chief Thundercloud (Tonto)", "Lynne Roberts (Joan Blanchard)", "Stanley Andrews (Captain Smith aka Colonel Jeffries)", "George Cleveland (George Blanchard)", "William Farnum (Father McKim)", "Hal Taliaferro (Bob Stuart)", "Lane Chandler (Dick Forrest)", "George Montgomery (Jim Clark)", "Sammy McKim (Sammy)", "John Merton (Henchman Kester)", "Tom London (Henchman Felton)", "Ray Bennett (Henchman Taggart)", "Maston Williams (Joe Snead)", "Frank McGlynn Sr. (Abraham Lincoln)", "Billy Bletcher (Lone Ranger (voice))", "Silver King the Horse (Silver)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
