Besides combining the elements of the risqu\u00e9 'blue' movies of the era with the popularity of movies about fires, it also attempted to use the combination to get extra mileage out of it.  The movie's title summarises the setup, and most of the footage shows firefighters using ladders to rescue stage girls, clad in portions of their costumes, from an upper level. Although it all seems pretty tame by today's standards, it no doubt provided its male viewers with some brief moments of excitement as the various women hurried down the ladders with their costumes in disarray.
