Rabi (Abdellah Didane), a female impersonator who dances with traveling fairs, teams up with Kacem (Hassen Essaklli), who hires him to ballyhoo his gambling concession. While Rabi's lack of romantic interest in women befuddles Kacem's son (Med Bastaoui), he does strike up a friendship with a schoolteacher (Nezha Rahile), who in her way is as much of a misfit as Rabi. Deliberately paced, Adieu Forain is dominated by the stark beauty of life at the side of the Moroccan highway.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cIlq3esuoxxxhLGJlhRPLTehllD.jpg", "actors": ["Hassan Essakali ()", "Mohamed Bastaoui ()", "Abdellah Didane ()", "Mohammed Miftah ()", "Nezha Rahile ()", "Abdelatif Khamouli ()", "Zohra Sadok ()", "Zineb Smaiki ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
