With an introduction and narration by hooper (of basketball and hulaalike) Shaquille O\u0092Neal, the film illuminates eight extraordinary stories of hoop devotees who have embraced it as an art form, a teaching aid, and even an instrument of redemption.  From the streets, to intimate clubs, to giant arenas, the film alternates between self-filmed video diaries, verit\u00e9 documentary footage, and spectacularly filmed performances. Filmed over six years, and featuring an appearance by late hoop-promoter and TV personality Art Linkletter, the film celebrates the healing power of movement and the spirit of human inventiveness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gjCfXnILnN2tZdWDujbkBWNdgO.jpg", "actors": ["Shaquille O'Neal (Himself)", "John Cameron Mitchell (Himself)", "Art Linkletter (Himself)", "Sandi Schultz (Herself)", "John Savage (Himself)", "Garry Marshall (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
