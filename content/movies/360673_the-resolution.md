This film, which he made with Judit Ember, another alert and sensitive director, was banned for ten years. In it, a rural community is in financial trouble and an expert from Budapest is sent to advise and reorganize. He is successful but his manner angers the local committee. Despite their own management failure, they feel his arrogance should be the subject of a reprimand at least. The story is more than just true: so sure was the community of its cause that Gazdag and Ember were invited to film the actual debate, and the reality makes us protagonists in the case. It is a situation that could happen anywhere but seldom has such a subject been treated in so absorbing and striking a way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/14qQUoZ9xolYPkFdOHYrqIZPk0V.jpg", "actors": ["Istv\u00e1n B\u00f3ka ()", "Gyula Est\u00e9lyi ()", "Gyula Farkas ()", "Istv\u00e1n Gr\u00f3f ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
