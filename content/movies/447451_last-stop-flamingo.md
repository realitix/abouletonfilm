Koszulinski investigates a region defined by imaginary histories and landscapes, from the drained and dredged river known as The Everglades to the man-made white sand beaches that make up Florida's coastline. Early visions of Florida landscapes are revealed, from the early 20th-century Koreshan utopian community, founded by Cyrus Teed in the swamplands of Florida, to the world's largest planned subdivision--Golden Gate Estates--which projected a population of over 400,000 residents. Five-hundred years after Ponce de Leon's discovery of Florida, Koszulinski reflects on the many ways in which Florida's landscapes have been irreversibly shaped by human desires.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
