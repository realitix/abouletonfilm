Many of the great films of the modern era are seen as such specifically **because** they don't give the audience answers, _Cactus_ however feels more like it has straight-forward missing pieces, the ones that would get us across the line to fully invested in the story.\r\n\r\nEven so, it's a watchable piece, with no more hideously glaring faults than memorable moments.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
