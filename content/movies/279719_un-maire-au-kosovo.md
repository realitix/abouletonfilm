Once removed their image of poor refugees on the roads, the Kosovars have strangely disappeared from the media world and Kosovo is again an abstraction. Bajram Rexhepi is entirely concrete. Surgeon by profession, he's a surgeon that fought the war in the ranks of the KLA, the Kosovo Liberation Army. With the upcoming of peace, his unquestioned authority made him the elected mayor of Mitrovica. The use made of this authority may undermine some misconceptions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mkIKgmVKGEgkWecADgG08eokyCj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
