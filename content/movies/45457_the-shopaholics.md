Into the mix come Kung Fu (Richie) Ho, a wealthy man who is stingy but also will buy anything someone else wants, and Ding Dong Ding, Lee's binge-eating bargain-shopping ex-girlfriend who reappears in hopes Lee will now choose her. Both men propose to both women who say yes to both. Family and friends are inept at helping to sort it out, and even if the four get the wedding vows straight, will anyone be cured? Does Hong Kong need more than a Prozac?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3mcvp3ZGCQbEwt7Yj2GPpat5o5.jpg", "actors": ["Lau Ching Wan (Dr. Choosey Lee)", "Cecilia Cheung (Fonda Fond / Fong Fong-Fong)", "Jordan Chan (Richie Ho Kung-Fu)", "Ella Koon (Ding Ding-Dong)", "Law Kar-Ying (West Ho)", "Paula Tsui (Dr. Phoenix Luk)", "Ha Chun-Chau (South Ho)", "Wong Tin-Lam (Uncle Fatty)", "Perrie Lai Hoi-San (Restaurant cashier)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
