The girls have been abducted and locked up in a horse stable, forced into sexual slavery and depravity, which leads to a fight to their final breath. Electric ear devices are planted to prevent escape with electric shock therapy. The diabolical family is an incest ridden tribe of an obese woman that never stops eating and a midget with a voice box for parents. Their two sons are repulsive, drooling inbreds with speech problems and a scabbed head. The daughter is a beautiful, young woman that is covered in scars, mentally and physically. Dead Girls Don't Cry is an Exploitation/ Revenge film that combines much more into one and pushes the boundaries of today's Horror.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Lynn Lowry ()", "Eileen Dietz (Diane Thomas)", "Stacey Dixon ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
