His geeky roommate Nate proposes they start a dance crew, but their search for other freestyle dancers proves fruitless. So they expand their search across town, finding a break-dancer, a performance artist, a Bhangra dancer, an animator, a ballerina, and a ballroom dance mom willing to join the new crew. A national dance battle headlined by Brandon's previous crew, Levelz, provides the first opportunity for Brandon to prove to himself and his family that he and his crew have what it takes to make it as dancers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nHwGKBD6YneE1gejRP4X2z4gZWM.jpg", "actors": ["Dushaunt Fik-Shun Stegall (Brandon)", "Keon Motakhaveri (Nate)", "Tetona Jackson (Lark)", "Heather Morris (Elizabeth)", "Hokuto 'Hok' Konishi (Xavier)", "Kevin Davis Jr. (Dante)", "James Moses Black (Vernon)", "Emilio Dosal (Levelz Crew)", "Anthony Marble (Professor Schmidt)", "Taylor Pierce (Celeste)", "Nasty Ray (Dunk)", "Taylor Thomas (Sabby)", "Maho Udo (Levelz Crew)", "Jaja Vankova (MonStars Crew)", "James Derrick (MonStars Crew)", "Makenzie Dustman (Zumba Instructor)", "Victoria Hazboun (Maddie)", "Lyric Heck (Margot)", "Michael Hinson (Marco)", "Jasmine Johnson (Kate)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
