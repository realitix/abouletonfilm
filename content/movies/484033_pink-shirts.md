A \u2018Plas Newydd\u2019 drama with a (tenous) 007 connection - it was scripted by travel writer Peter Fleming, brother of James Bond creator Ian Fleming! A detective posing as a footman infiltrates the \u2018Pink Shirts\u2019 (satirising Britain\u2019s Blackshirts) and plots their downfall. They must have had a ball, the family, friends and staff of the 6th Marquis of Anglesey, pretending to be fascists (waders came in useful here) or defenders of democracy armed with a catapult and drawing pins.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
