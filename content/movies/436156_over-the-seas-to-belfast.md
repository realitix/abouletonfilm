The Scythia is a cruise ship that was converted to a troop transport during World War II; in 1940 it carried children from Liverpool to New York as part of an evacuation program set up by the Children's Overseas Reception Board. The present voyage is among the first to carry civilian passengers from North America to the British Isles following the end of the war. Among the passengers are 150 child evacuees, who have spent several years growing up in Canada or the USA.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bxpMGe6jVrjlftBA2PXwYsHm9mi.jpg", "actors": ["James A.
