It begins when Soichiro Kaji (Terao), a retired detective, walks into police headquarters and confesses to the murder of his wife. We learn that the victim had prematurely developed Alzheimer's after the tragic death of their son, and in her suffering, had asked to die. The police chiefs would be far more content to take him at his word if it were not for a conspicuous hole in his story: 48-hour gap between the alleged murder and his confession. Fearing a public relations nightmare, they are eager to bury the incident and keep the press in the dark.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uUarFAeZBa6MsH46fU9McAumdRz.jpg", "actors": ["Akira Terao (Soichiro Kaji)", "Mieko Harada (Keiko Kaji)", "Hidetaka Yoshioka (Keigo Fujibayashi)", "Mayu Tsuruta (Yoko Nakao)", "Jun Kunimura (Manabu Uemura)", "Tsuyoshi Ihara (Morio Sase)", "Kyusaku Shimada ()", "Yosuke Saito ()", "Ikuji Nakamura ()", "Takashi Sasano ()", "Yasuhito Shimao ()", "Kosuke Toyohara ()", "Masaki Terasoma ()", "Mitsuru Kato ()", "Toshiaki Ogawa ()", "Tetsuhiro Sai ()", "Saburo Tamura ()", "Daisuke Nagakura ()", "Toshiyuki Nishida ()", "Shir\u00f4 Namiki ()", "Hoshi Ishida (Toshiya Kaji)", "Anzu Nagai (Manabu Uemura's daughter)", "Takako Ariyasu ()", "Sayuri Murase ()", "Tomoko Kubota ()", "Hirotaro Honda ()", "Ry\u00f4sei Tayama ()", "Kaoru Okunuki ()", "Masuyo Iwamoto ()", "Seiichi Tanabe ()", "Renji Ishibashi ()", "Hisashi Igawa ()", "Reiko Takashima (Akiko Uemura)", "Kirin Kiki (Yasuko Shimamura)", "Tomoko Naraoka (Dr. Takaki)", "Kyohei Shibata (Kazumasa Shiki)", "Issey Takahashi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
