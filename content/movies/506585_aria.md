It is through a series of portraits, of people leaning their faces over her belly that the artist proposes a diversity of stories and reflections on motherhood, parenthood, the desire or not to have a child, descent, and childhood. Entirely shot using smartphones, the film proposes an intimate journey, told via sensitive, fun or moving words, a contemporary family album.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["\u00c9milie Jouvet (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
