All Padstownians participate in the event, which has now become a tourist attraction drawing over tens of thousands of annual visitors. Folklorists Alan Lomax and Peter Kennedy and filmmaker George Pickow collected footage at the festival in 1951, producing a pioneering work in the use of sound, low-light photography, and conversational presentation of narrative. A favorite of Margaret Mead, who used it in her classes, the film circulated widely and continues to have influence today, especially in the neo-Pagan community.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ajb5QVhQvyvqnWzMKYbQHbA0LEM.jpg", "actors": ["Charlie Chilton (Himself - Narrator)", "Charlie Bate (Himself - Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ISO1QmG_VE4"}
