Located in the quiet Calgary neighbourhood of Bridgeland, the Margaret Chisholm Resettlement Centre is the starting point for government-assisted refugees who arrive in the city. During the 19-day timeline established by the federal government, an initial assessment is done and refugees are assisted with everything from airport reception and orientation to referrals, documents, and counselling. 19 Days reveals the human side of the refugee resettlement process. A unique look at the global migration crisis and one particular stage of asylum, it lays plain the realities faced on the difficult road towards integration.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aB4MIkKT0mZth9lNNhf8rUcZppg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
