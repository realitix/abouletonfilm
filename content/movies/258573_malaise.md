It's quite obvious thanks to the chunky retro-futuristic look he captured with the interior design of the ships, which pay homage to that era of scifi. Beaulieu chose to marry a more stylized look for the characters with more realistic animation, which actually ended up working pretty well within the confines of this mini narrative.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8MvsMMwDQDHmG79w8I9caXmLxgU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "fsTZTyUyNnU"}
