Her parents came to this megacity 25 years ago from their agricultural background, hoping to leave behind a harsh reality for a land of dreams. But in a whirlwind that sweeps them off their feet, they realize that the ground they stand on is an illusion in the first place, and wonder if their dream is after all to be found with ploughs and sickles, underneath the very piece of land they left behind.
