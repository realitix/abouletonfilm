It was all unbeknownst to the artist himself -- his music was even unknown to those living in his hometown in Ghana. Years of tireless searching ensued, and eventually the Los Angeles-based label owner found a lead. Ata Kak - Time Bomb follows the search that Shimkovitz undertook as well as the visit to Ghana that took place once he found him. It is a celebration of great tunes and how, when it hits the right audience at the right time, music can touch people in a way that you never imagined.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/85XeZ08gzCTbE9tHhYkunN2XS1A.jpg", "actors": ["Ata Kak (Himself)", "Brian Shimkovitz (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "pn0_s9gJ6CI"}
