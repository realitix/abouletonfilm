In one sequence Jefferson Airplane's Lather asks the question, \u2018Is it true I'm no longer young?\u2019 Time makes us prisoners locked in ourselves, like the a small yellow bird who slips behind the back of a playing card, then comes back out in front of it. In rapid alternation, they make a kind of thaumatrope, that spinning parlor trick that suggests a sense of movement in the flapping wings of a caged bird. Here the birdcage has been replaced by chance, underscoring the momentary illusion that the bird is free.\" - Genevieve Yue", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [306216, 86282, 199177, 155006], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
