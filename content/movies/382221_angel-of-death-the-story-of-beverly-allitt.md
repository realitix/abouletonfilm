The judge gave her a sentence of 30 years imprisonment, one of the longest sentences given to a woman in this country - exceeded only by those of Rosemary West and Myra Hindley. In the role of Allitt herself, giving an excellently controlled performance, is former  \"EastEnders\" actress Charlie Brooks.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Charlie Brooks ()", "Joanna Bending ()", "Ian Kelsey ()", "Georgie Glen ()", "Hajaz Akram ()", "Tegwen Tucker ()", "Rob Dixon ()", "Helen Baxendale (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
