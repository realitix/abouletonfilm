It is one designer\u2019s personal experience of issues that face all designers, expressed with sympathy and encouragement, and illustrated with examples of Inge [Druckrey]\u2019s own work and that of grateful generations of her students. There are simple phrases that give insights into complex matters, for example that letterforms are \u2018memories of motion.\u2019 Above all, it is characteristic of Inge that in this examination of basic principles the word \u201cbeautiful\u201d is used several times.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1kLBm997DXiTz4XpVdC9P3DAewd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
