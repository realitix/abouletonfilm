Three individuals living together in a large house and they don't always see eye to eye. Did I mention they were also hitmen? Butting heads becomes the least of their worries when an evil curse is placed on them that will raise the corpses of the people they have killed after their toll hits one-hundred. When the clock strikes midnight, the bodies re-animate and the three must fight for survival from their undead foes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8h6wtyab0pHxuHUHIoz3TgqWAUM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
