Puce Moment resulted from the unfinished short film Puce Women. The film opens with a camera watching 1920s style flapper gowns being taken off a dress rack. The dresses are removed and danced off the rack to music. (The original soundtrack was Verdi opera music; in the 1960s, Anger re-released the film with a new psychedelic folk-rock soundtrack performed by Jonathan Halper.) A long-lashed woman, Yvonne Marquis, dresses in the purple puce gown and walks to her vanity to apply perfume. She lies on a chaise lounge which then begins to move around the room and eventually out to a patio. Borzois appear and she prepares to take them for a walk.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jSplPGdMxM7e0YgsCbCTditU8Ct.jpg", "actors": ["Yvonne Marquis (Hollywood Star)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [46784, 126197, 144943, 104407], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
