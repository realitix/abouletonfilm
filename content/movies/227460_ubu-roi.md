The story follows Ubu on his journey to overthrow the current ruler and become King of Poland. Along the way he betrays many of his followers, taxes the civilians to an unreasonable degree and eventually slaughters everyone. Along his side, is the equally crude but somehow more likable Mere Ubu, who's like a foul mouthed Lady Macbeth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j2cQVkaWJV3cmCVt1rvdQsgw48i.jpg", "actors": ["Jean Bouise ()", "Rosy Varte ()", "Hubert Deschamps ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
