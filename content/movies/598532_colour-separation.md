High contrast film stock was run three times through a stationary camera; once for each of the light primaries. In the composite image, anything moving is represented in primary or secondary colour whilst anything still, having been filmed through all three filters, is represented in \u201ccorrect\u201d colour.  When projected the film resembles a moving impressionist painting but the passing of time is not represented by the coloured marks of a painters brush but by the colored emulsion of the film stock.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vN5seremhay78RmFmoQFUf5q3Tm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
