From the youthful air of the Modern Literature magazine, which he helped launch at the age of 22, to the humanistic sincerity in his recent works My Father and the Republic and Healing the Pain, Pai looks back on his 29 years teaching at Santa Barbara, a four-decade relishing of Guilin rice noodles, and a return visit to the gardens of Suzhou after 10 years. Through the darkened realm of the stage, to the countless lectures and courses he taught, Pai has been at the forefront of literature for multiple generations, with his unique blend of resilience and tenderness reverberating through the film, and bringing audiences closer to his warmth as a novelist.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/picEeovpzKAfSanR2XHiVeVW4vr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
