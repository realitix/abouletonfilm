During their eventful pilgrimage the carefree fun-loving (and seeking) protagonists encounter a mixed bag of folks who include a perky middle-aged lady who wrecks cars for a living, two sexy swinging babes, a friendly farmer, and a hotshot aspiring motocross rider teen who challenges Dancer to a race. This latter episode ends in tragedy, with the kid taking a fatal spill off his bike. So the kid's gung-ho militant gun fanatic father decides to hunt Dancer and Mitchell down in his sinister souped-up truck.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/exxMXYg2waO2k3Gp9BfEnv55J4g.jpg", "actors": ["Marc Alaimo ()", "Ernie Garrett (Ernie)", "John Hoyt ()", "Perry Lang (Jim Dancer)", "Michael MacRae ()", "Michael Sullivan (Steve Mitchell)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
