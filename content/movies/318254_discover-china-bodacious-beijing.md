Not content with a tourist-only view of Beijing, this documentary hangs with the locals in roadside food stalls and antique flea markets. But the big landmarks -- such as the Great Wall and the Forbidden City -- are showcased amply as well. Like any good vacation, this whirlwind of culture, history, shopping and food will leave you satisfied and reluctant to return home.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
