The film reels are supplied to the projectionist with a die with each of the colors on a side. The projectionist rolls the die to determine the running order of the reels. The story is designed so that each ordering creates different implications to the film as a whole.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
