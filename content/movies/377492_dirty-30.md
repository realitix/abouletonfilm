Kate spends her days at a middling job and her nights alone or on failed dates. Evie is married with the in-laws from hell, wandering from one charitable cause to the next. Charlie has the girl of her dreams but just can\u2019t seem to pull her business (or her act) together. On the eve of Kate\u2019s 30th birthday, she agrees to let Evie and Charlie throw her a party. But what\u2019s supposed to be a simple celebration becomes a wild who\u2019s who of past and present, and things quickly spiral out of control.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1FQeEvE4vjwuiiuND1ljc9Ndj3k.jpg", "actors": ["Grace Helbig (Evie)", "Mamrie Hart (Kate)", "Hannah Hart (Charlie)", "Matt Dellapina (Dan)", "Adam Lustick (Richard / Raven)", "Andrew Ridings (Todd)", "Anna Akana (Ashley)", "Katherine Hughes (Kinsey)", "Mikey Murphy (Oliver)", "Link Neal (Dude #2)", "Rhett McLaughlin (Dude #1)", "Chester See (Ben)", "Flula Borg (DJ)", "Joselyn Hughes (Waitress)", "Drew Monson (Rufus)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [251227, 254170, 61016, 469799], "youtube_key": "We5kzVJcSic"}
