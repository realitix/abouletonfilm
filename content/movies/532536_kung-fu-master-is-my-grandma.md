When Gucci (Isabel Chan) was tossed into lock-up, her father had already been dead for years. Gucci always thought that her mother would live forever, but upon getting out of prison she discovers that her mother, too, has passed away. Now Gucci's sole guardian is Wong Fei Hung (Helena Law), an old fashioned woman who isn't accustomed to change. At first aghast at the prospect of living with the crusty old woman, Gucci soon finds her life changed for the better thanks to grandma's wisdom and compassion. Later, when Gucci lands in trouble once again, grandma Wong Fei Hung leaps into action.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2aLxqa5vEtGhnCADnU84FaRBpUO.jpg", "actors": ["Helena Law Lan (Granny Wong Fei Hung)", "Wayne Lai (Probation Officer Ming)", "Lam Suet (Internet Cafe Boss)", "Marco Ngai (Cool Man)", "Samuel Leung Cheuk-Moon (Kee)", "Josephine Lam (Ms Wong)", "Isabel Chan (Gucci Wong)", "Gloria Cheng Gung-Jing (Dior)", "Yoyo Yiu Wing-Man (Kay)", "Kitty Chung Kit-Yee (Cool Man's wife)", "Tong Law-Man (Little Kim)", "Kong Hon (Hung's doctor)", "Hui Fan (Porky)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
