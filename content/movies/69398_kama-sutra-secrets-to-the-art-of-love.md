The primary set is a large bedroom, with the bed in the center; the walls are yellow, the lighting soft; mirrors sometimes provide additional angles. Music plays. The silent couples move rhythmically and keep their cool.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/19IJOmy8X1ciutTkrgV6bjW8xCE.jpg", "actors": ["Brigitte Lahaie (Voice)", "Asia-Kiss ()", "Georges Brasero ()", "Estelle Desanges ()", "Carla Paris ()", "Philippe Visconti ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
