Ince, as Roller McCray, a steelworker turned ruthless tycoon whose tough business methods leads a rival (Philip Strange) to commit suicide. The widow (Aileen Pringle), believing she can ruin Ince by using his own methods, conspires with her husband's former partner (Sam De Grasse), but a strong friendship between Ince and Pringle's young son (Freddie Burke Frederick) changes things dramatically. According to future Three Stooges director Edward Bernds, who worked as a sound mixer on Wall Street, Ince's reaction to his rival's suicidal jump from a window ledge was changed from a sneering \"I didn't think he had the guts\" to the more respectful \"I didn't think he'd do it\" due to derisive laughter from the film's crew.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3Y8cXVMSYQEcE8Ns8p5SOKGyEd0.jpg", "actors": ["Ralph Ince ()", "Aileen Pringle ()", "Philip Strange ()", "Sam De Grasse ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
