Even though he's had little to do with his daughter Rita, he begs her to take him to Denmark to find this lost love. She agrees and unceremoniously drops her baby off at her husband Steff's office where he's been working overtime to avoid bankruptcy. Rita and Bob pick up a hitchhiker, Erik, who plays to Rita's longing for freedom. Steff, with baby and teenage daughter, sets out in pursuit of his wife, jealous and also feeling pangs of love. On the road, Bob and Rita bond as do Steff and his children. On the Danish coast, Bob and Sabine, Rita, Steff, and Erik must sort out their dreams.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gkVbsoWH17sj1yLT3iVarVkXf6P.jpg", "actors": ["Marika Lagercrantz (Rita)", "Philip Zand\u00e9n (Steff)", "Per Oscarsson (Bob)", "Gert Fylking (Rolling)", "Michael Segerstr\u00f6m (Motorcycle Patrol)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
