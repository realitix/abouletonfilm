Full of local color and great background music, it follows Adela, a fictional flamenco costume designer, on an important day in her life. Adela's activities are intercut by scenes from the two streets that intersect near her front window. We see that just as there a rhythm to Adela's life, each street also has its own rhythm. Background music includes the cante (flamenco singing) of well-known flamenco artist Antonio de la Malena, plus original compositions by guitarist Malena Hijo", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
