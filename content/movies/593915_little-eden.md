Several million years later, we follow the mishaps of Simon Moog, a former High Energy Astrophysicist and Edena, a world renowned psychic healer who suffers from an inoperable brain tumor. The lives of both characters revolve around the premise that everything that exists evlolved from stardust, and beyond that there is a great, mysterious force that governs the universe.
