He turns to the several women in his life for succor: his wife (Marion Cotillard), his mistress (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz), his costume designer (Judi Dench), his star actress (Nicole Kidman), his mother (Sophia Loren), a fashion journalist (Kate Hudson) and a prostitute from his boyhood (Fergie).\r\n\r\nThis is an adaptation of the 1982 Broadway musical, also dubbed \u201cNine,\u201d which itself was based on Federico Fellini's semi-autobiographical 1963 film \u201c8\u00bd.\u201d It\u2019s very similar to director Rob Marshall\u2019s \u201cChicago\u201d (2002), but with a different story, cast and location (Rome and points nearby).\r\n\r\nDuring the first half I wasn\u2019t so sure about the story, but I eventually found myself absorbed into the life of the tormented director and his mid-life crisis. His unfaithfulness to his beautiful wife, Luisa (Cotillard), is off-putting of course, but maybe we should have mercy for a man who has scores of gorgeous women offering themselves to him practically every day. It helps that he WANTS to be free from his adulteries and be true to Luisa.\r\n\r\nYet I have a hard time picturing Guido (Day-Lewis) seeking the amorous attentions of Carla (Cruz) above Luisa. Carla is decent, as far as all-around physical beauty goes, but Luisa has better curves. Both of the characters\u2019 have imaginative dance sequences, but Luisa comes out on top even though her routine is less tantalizing.\r\n\r\nDay-Lewis is fascinating as the guilt-stricken director who hasn\u2019t let his fame go to his head. When he asks a cleric for advice about God and his troubles, the vicar responds: \u201cImagination is God\u2019s garden, don\u2019t let the devil play in it.\u201d\r\n\r\nI generally don\u2019t favor musicals where the characters suddenly jump into song & dance while walking at the park or eating dinner. My wife & I sometimes poke fun of these kinds of musicals by mimicking them while doing mundane activities. For me, musicals only work, generally speaking, when the singing/dancing sequences are legitimate, like a performance at a nightclub or one's imagination, both of which were used in \"Chicago.\" Of course it\u2019s more challenging and takes more creativity to incorporate song & dance routines in this manner and keep the movie seamless & realistic. \u201cNine\u201d does this.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 58 minutes and was shot in Italy and England.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"}], "recommandations_id": [27585, 3902, 1574, 590], "youtube_key": "cSAmAP_yWpY"}
