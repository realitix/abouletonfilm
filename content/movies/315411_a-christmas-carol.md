Since that time it has been the subject of countless adaptations for theatrical productions, radio, film, television, and even the opera! This musical version, adapted by Maxwell Anderson for the television show Shower of Stars, features Fredric March (The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit) as the misanthropic Ebenezer Scrooge, who's redemption comes after a ghostly night-time journey through his Christmas Past, Present and Future, and March received an Emmy nomination for his portrayal. The great Basil Rathbone (The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes) co-stars as the ghost of Scrooge's dead partner Jacob Marley, in what many consider to be the best and most chilling portrayal of Marley ever.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cD8bYTbiu94LLPR6H4PQJHjjWHI.jpg", "actors": ["William Lundigan (Host)", "Mary Costa (Co-host)", "Fredric March (Ebenezer Scrooge)", "Basil Rathbone (Marley's Ghost)", "Bob Sweeney (Bob Cratchit)", "Christopher Cook (Tiny Tim Cratchit)", "Craig Hill (Young Scrooge)", "Queenie Leonard (Mrs. Cratchit)", "Rex Evans (Solicitor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
