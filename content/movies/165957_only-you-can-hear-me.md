Though she wants to make friends, she has trouble speaking up and holding a normal conversation like everyone else. It seems that whenever she talks, the words just don't come out correctly. Gradually, Ryo has gotten used to living life in silence as a lonely and introverted student. With no one to talk to, Ryo also has no need for a cell phone. Longing for friends to talk to, she creates a cell phone in her mind for imaginary phone conversations, and much to her surprise, one day Shinya picks up on the other side. For the first time in her life, Ryo has found someone she can talk to.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/itDvZvgL5wlkbfmWu0rnFkchzIU.jpg", "actors": ["Riko Narumi (Ryo Aihara)", "Keisuke Koide (Shinya Nozaki)", "Nana Katase (Ryo Harada)", "Hideo Nakano (Tetsushi Aihara)", "Y\u00fbko Kotegawa (Nobuko Aihara)", "Kaoru Yachigusa (Sachi Nozaki)", "Mika Hada (School Doctor)", "Shinichiro Ishikawa (Yoshida)", "Koichi Iwaki (Toda)", "Rikako Sakata (Miki Aihara)", "Nobuhiko Takada (Mr. Yamaguchi)", "Ryouji Sugimoto (World History Teacher)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
