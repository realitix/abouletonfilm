Looking more like a mellow, mid-life surfer than hairy rock icon from the 1980s, the ever-expansive Hagar leads the Waboritas through a long, hot 2002 tour, sharing a bill with David Lee Roth, Hagar's co-outcast from Van Halen. Despite their shared ignominy, Roth rebuffs Hagar's efforts at collaboration, or at least camaraderie, resulting in a competitive and entertainingly catty atmosphere.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Sammy Hagar (Himself)", "Michael Anthony (Himself)", "Vic Johnson (Himself)", "Mona Gnader (Herself)", "David Lauser (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
