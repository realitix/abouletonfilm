The resulting conflicts between the hitchhiker, who respects no rules or boundaries, and the family, provide the substance for most of the humor in this sincere but not especially well-thought-out film. Reviewers who saw the film at the 1967 Mannheim Film Festival expressed the opinion that it was an unformed work by a promising talent.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kPQlu49f3FGnQwrJ1pcrYITA1tJ.jpg", "actors": ["Wies Andersen ()", "Hetty Verhoogt ()", "Ramses Shaffy ()", "Henk Molenberg ()", "Lyda Lobo ()", "Stijntje Portegies-Zwart ()", "Karina Heuff ()", "Petra Hopman ()", "Mila Jansen ()", "Ati van der Lingen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
