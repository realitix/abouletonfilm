Stephanie, an optimistic girl with bright pink hair, comes to live in LazyTown and meets a zany mix of townspeople, including the world\u2019s laziest super-villain, Robbie Rotten.  Fortunately for Stephanie, LazyTown is also under the watchful eye of Sportacus, an athletic, super-active, slightly-above-average hero, who runs, jumps, flips and flies to the rescue in his futuristic AirShip. Sportacus always manages to save the day and to help the kids of LazyTown foil Robbie\u2019s latest lazy schemes.  The citizens of Lazytown learn the importance of things like eating right and exercising from the ultra-athletic superhero, Sportucus, who must stop the evil plots of Robbie Rotten, who hates physical activity, among other things.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ogRo0hjNDAVI1Optb33SBLu8fQg.jpg", "actors": ["Stef\u00e1n Karl Stef\u00e1nsson (Robbie Rotten)", "Magn\u00fas Scheving (Sportacus)", "Julianna Rose Mauriello (Stephanie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [69291, 410010, 31392], "youtube_key": "IUMecbBXCcA"}
