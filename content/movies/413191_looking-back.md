He meets with the novel's female author, a University professor and writer named Olga Machov\u00e1 (Jirina Trebick\u00e1), approximately ten-years-older than him. In the beginning, they do not understand each other at all. Frantisek is a skeptic experiencing a moral crisis, unsatisfied with both his work and his private life - he lives separated from his wife and has no deeper feelings for his numerous lovers. He even gets drunk from time to time and breaks the public peace. Olga is lonesome, too, but considers her life fulfilled.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y2P8yKjZ8CKf0oGzDAK0C17tMgn.jpg", "actors": ["Jirina Trebick\u00e1 (Olga Machova)", "Petr \u010cepek (Franti\u0161ek \u010cern\u00fd)", "Miroslav Noh\u00fdnek (Lojz\u00ed\u010dek)", "Pavel Moskalyk (M\u00edta)", "Pavel Simko (Mi\u0161a Barecnyj, bizto\u0161)", "Jaroslav Vondr\u00e1cek (Kvapil)", "Jan Dzub\u00e1k (Vaska)", "V\u00e1clav Kankovsk\u00fd ()", "Ladislav Vicar (Gestap\u00e1k)", "Ivan Kheil (Fel\u00fcgyel\u00f5)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
