Franz is leader of a mercenary group that fights against native rebels, but Rudy only wants some money from his next of kin (on one occasion, he says: \"You know I can't stand violence\"). But Franz, a racist who sees Africans merely as animals, just wants him to leave again immediately. Then, Franz gets abducted and imprisoned by the rebels. Rudy joins forces with the other mercenaries, who are as fascist as Franz and like to kill Africans and rape their wives. He does so to make a deal with Franz as soon as they have freed him, but the mercenaries get attacked on more than one occasion by the natives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2YeYN664j58nh7oM1yqbKwQjudF.jpg", "actors": ["Bryan Rostron ()", "Thomas Kerr ()", "Anthony Freeman ()", "Charles Borromel ()", "Karin Well ()", "Pierluigi Giorgio ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
