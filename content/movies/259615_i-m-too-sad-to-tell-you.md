The film was initially ten minutes long, and included Ader rubbing his eyes to produce the tears, but was cut down to three and a half minutes. This shorter version captures Ader at his most anguished. His face is framed closely. There is no introduction or conclusion, no reason given and no relief from the anguish that is presented.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qboA4r7nnvzip6CtsbxrcOjja6Y.jpg", "actors": ["Bas Jan Ader (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
