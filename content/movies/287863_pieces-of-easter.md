After a deal is struck the mismatched pair sets out on a three day odyssey of misadventure along the highways and byways of America where they encounter rat infested hotels, convenience store hold ups, rural rabbit stalkers and a starstruck couple from a local trailer park. Best of all, they are forced to encounter each other as the two worlds of the princess and hermit collide at each and every turn. A humorous retelling of The Story of The Prodigal Son, told through the eyes of a young woman looking to make amends while she searches for the road back home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kGStLoVAZEaAuCdiraGorYWZoWV.jpg", "actors": ["Christina Marie Karis (Alza Reese Bennett (as Christina Karis))", "Jefferson Moore (Lincoln James)", "Nakia Barney (Kelly Reese)", "Sylvia Boykin (Waitress)", "Phillip Cherry (Reverend White)", "Melissa Combs (Joy)", "Rodney Cox (Alza's Cousin)", "Pattie Crawford (Phylicia Reese)", "Ron DeSoto (Police officer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
