It is about fame and our culture of obsession. Actor Darren McWarren (Jason Gann) starred in soap, mini-series and film before destroying his career with a series of indiscretions. Now McWarren is out of the industry and living in a small town in Western Victoria he can do whatever he wants. When a journalist decides to write a \"Where are they now\" profile on McWarren, he finds the former star has become a modern day Errol Flynn. The local girls want to fornicate with him and their fellas want to fight him. He mightn't have found love - but it's the next best thing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xUuxMiYSE6RPPZjK0Qw4YpwtBVn.jpg", "actors": ["Jason Gann (Darren McWarren)", "Adam Zwar (Ben)", "Anya Beyersdorf (Cindy)", "Paul Denny (Bruce)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
