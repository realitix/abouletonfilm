It packs a punch of theological and emotional power gloved in all the soft, warm fuzzies that make family viewing so enjoyable. The movie opens with a glimpse of the nativity scene portrayed in a very touching and human way and then quickly jumps into the drama of the closing hours of the life of Christ.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
