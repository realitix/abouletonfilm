Arriving there, the prince not only is charmed by the young lady (who wouldn't?), but also mistakenly believes her to be the famous singer who is to be the female lead in the opera. What Willy does not know yet is that the real singer has cancelled her appearance, and as the state ministers hope to distract him from politics with the performance of the opera, they indeed want Ronny to appear in the show\u2026.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tUSdv4ldTN5qD7zMtxbfBCpzGB4.jpg", "actors": ["K\u00e4the von Nagy (Ronny)", "Marc Dantzer (Rudolph, Prince of Perusa)", "Lucien Baroux (Theater director)", "Georges Deneubourg (Minister of Justice)", "Gustave Huberdeau (Minister of State)", "Charles Fallot (Finance Minister)", "Monique Casty (Lisa)", "Guy Sloux (Bomboni)", "Lucien Callamand (Anton)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
