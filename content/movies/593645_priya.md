The footage was buried in various organic materials deteriorating the initial image in an attempt to shift cultural specificity and linear narratives of time and space. Rituals of burial expound successive memories of entombment; the skin of the film becomes the body of the dancer, fracturing time into a darkly evocative, psychological space.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hvMIRn8WVrEFsfDeOs48BGZFLHP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
