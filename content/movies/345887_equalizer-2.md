Though I certainly liked _The Equalizer_ more, I am a fan of both movies (so I guess the whole franchise at this point) and if Denzel is up for making more of these Defender-of-the-Downtrodden, ass-kickin' super soldier Action movies with human-interest stories peppered in via the supporting characters, then I'll sure as Hell keep watching 'em.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"}], "recommandations_id": [347375, 353081, 447200, 400535]}
