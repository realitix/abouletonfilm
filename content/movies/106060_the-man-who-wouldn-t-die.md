At the house, Wolff's daughter Catherine arrives unexpectedly and tells her step-mother Anne Wolff that she has just been married to Roger Blake who will be along in a few days. Cathy retires and is awakened by a mysterious assailant who fires a shot at her, but her parents tell her she was just dreaming. Wolff goes to the cemetery and finds the body missing. The scared Cathy calls in fast-talking private detective Mike Shayne and, since her father doesn't like detectives, she introduces him as her husband. That evening Shayne hears a shot and finds that Haggard has been killed. While the police are questioning the family, the lights go out and a shot is fired from outside.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pF98gI57x1VK87V6ZYcEFKGhHuC.jpg", "actors": ["Lloyd Nolan (Michael Shayne)", "Marjorie Weaver (Catherine Wolff)", "Helene Reynolds (Anna Wolff)", "Henry Wilcoxon (Dr. Haggard)", "Richard Derr (Roger Blake)", "Paul Harvey (Dudley Wolff)", "Billy Bevan (Phillips, the Butler)", "Olin Howland (Chief of Police Jonathan Meek (as Olin Howlin))", "Robert Emmett Keane (Alfred Dunning)", "LeRoy Mason (Zorah Bey)", "Jeff Corey (Coroner Tim Larsen)", "Francis Ford (Caretaker)", "Dorothy Malone (Bit)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [121992, 28425, 106239], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
