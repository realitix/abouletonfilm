In outline, the film could not be more straightforward: it offers a recitation of one of Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s most celebrated and complex poems (it was his last published work in his own lifetime, appearing in 1897, a year before his death) and proposes a cinematic equivalent for the author\u2019s original experiment with typography and layout by assigning the words to nine different speakers, separating each speaker from the other as she or he speaks, and using slight pauses to correspond with white spaces on the original page.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4AXbMizGp3ehhgIQXaMru2ecX9c.jpg", "actors": ["Helmut F\u00e4rber ((Re)citer)", "Michel Delahaye ((Re)citer)", "Georges Goldfayn ((Re)citer)", "Dani\u00e8le Huillet ((Re)citer)", "Manfred Blank ((Re)citer)", "Maril\u00f9 Parolini ((Re)citer)", "Aksar Khaled ((Re)citer)", "Andrea Spingler ((Re)citer)", "Dominique Villain ((Re)citer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
