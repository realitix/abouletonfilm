PRC and Monogram started churning them out in the mid-forties as part of their let-this-be-a-lesson-to-you genre, preceded by the zoot-suiter and jitter-buggers films, which was better than the social guidance films teen-agers were being overdosed on at school. PRC did at least use card-carrying members of SAG. This one is a sermon against speeding, and Darryl Hickman has it brought straight home to him when he side-swipes a car and causes a collision in which his best friend is killed---the fate of all best friends in juvenile-theme movies including \"Rebel Without a Cause\"--- and his mother is injured. Lots of lecturing precedes and follows.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/643tvJGBgysD3DS7i1KzkVemm26.jpg", "actors": ["Noreen Nash (Sue Tanner)", "Darryl Hickman (Michael 'Micky' Clark)", "Terry Moore (Rusty Davis (as Jan Ford))", "James Cardwell (Jeff Clark)", "Damian O'Flynn (John Clark)", "Lenita Lane (Mrs. Clark)", "William Forrest (Judge Roger Tanner)", "Sue England (Peggy Andrews)", "Robert Arthur (Todd Powell)", "Ann Burr (Judy Clark)", "John Hamilton (Mr. Davis)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
