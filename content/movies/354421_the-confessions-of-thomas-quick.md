Held for decades in a psychiatric institute, Quick's confessions emerged after years working with a group of touchy feely therapists, convinced that the recovery of memories would cure patients of their criminality. In a country with a low crime rate, the nation watched with horror as Quick's confessions mounted, accounting for many of the country's unsolved murders. With testimonials from a range of people whose lives have been dominated by this story - including Quick himself - and dramatic reenactment, Brian Hill weaves a stylish noir thriller that works a treat on the big screen. What appears at first to be a tale of unimaginable evil evolves into something much more layered as Hill digs deep into the motivations behind those working closely with Quick.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/41d2miYUuPQM8E78l7rsLlhXJJu.jpg", "actors": ["Sture Bergwall (Himself)", "Mimmi Kandler (Wife of Bank Manager)", "Oskar Thunberg (Thomas Quick)", "Patrik Dufwa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [318052, 103198, 455479, 423611], "youtube_key": "yM56OQM9BCU"}
