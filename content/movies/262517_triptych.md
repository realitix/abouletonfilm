The first is an old woman trapped in a forced marriage; the second is a schoolteacher imposing progress on the remote region; the third, and most important, is Khalima (Kambarova), an illiterate but determined young woman who resolves to build her own house without either her husband's or the state's approval. The film's harsh vision of life in postwar Uzbekistan, as well as its ambivalent attitude toward the conflicting demands of individualism and collectivism, made it the object of official disapproval.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/adj82UHCL6mKR0NqDu8FDp1E8Vn.jpg", "actors": ["Dilorom Kambarova (Khalima)", "Gulya Tashbayeva (Zanobar)", "Zukhra Abdurakamanova (Khadicha)", "Anvara Alimova (Khalima's Mother)", "Saidmurad Ziyautdinov (Abdulla)", "Z.
