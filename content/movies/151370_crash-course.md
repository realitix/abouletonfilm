Among the students is Riko, a cocky guy; Chad, a guy from a privileged background, who's terrified to get behind the wheel; Vanessa, who's over protective mom who wouldn't allow her to take the course, who went behind her back; and Maria, a spoiled foreign student. Now the principal wants the students to pass so he tells the instructor, who's still not over his wife leaving and is not exactly up to the task, that it's important for the students to pass so he brought in a special instructor, who's very tough. And the principal also tells one of his teachers to let, one of the students Maslanski who's the school football star, pass the test he failed so that he can concentrate on driver's ed. But the teacher, seeing this as an opportunity to expose the principal as not doing his job and thus paving the way for him to be the new principal, makes Maslanski take a make up test", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mzFUPZuBGWsUegJ1UzVRlQ6hWGK.jpg", "actors": ["Jack\u00e9e Harry (Edna Savage)", "Alyssa Milano (Vanessa Crawford)", "Tina Yothers (Alice Santini)", "Dick Butkus (Ed Konner)", "Brian Bloom (Riko Konner)", "Harvey Korman (Abner Fraser)", "Olivia d'Abo (Maria Abeja)", "BD Wong (Kichi)", "Ray Walston (Principal Paulson)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "yRd6sHVVTIg"}
