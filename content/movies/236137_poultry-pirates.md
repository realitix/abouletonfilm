The Captain, armed with a board, is standing guard (but not fixing the fence). He falls asleep, and the poultry attack, stripping the garden methodically. When the Captain comes after them, they lock him into a shed. He gets out, and fetches his shotgun. That stops them, and they drop their booty, until the Captain sets his gun down to collect the veggies; the birds all rush in, snatch them back.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kOWMGVrhd2EX0hdnPxiX46Nxu2a.jpg", "actors": ["Billy Bletcher (Captain)", "Mel Blanc (Duck)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
