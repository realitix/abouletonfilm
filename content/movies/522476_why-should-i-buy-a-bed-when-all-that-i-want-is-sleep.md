Known in the U.S. primarily as Merton\u2019s best friend and in Europe as a daringly original avant-garde poet, Lax lived a life of simplicity, humility and grace that continues to encourage and motivate readers and followers.  This film is a portrait of Robert Lax as he was to those who were fortunate to visit him during his thirty years of living on the Greek island of Patmos.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qxGKOx1vK1q24OCeW1W7dDKR5ug.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Lax ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
