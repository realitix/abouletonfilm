Some of the newcomers were legal immigrants. Some were not. A blogger named Greg Letiecq began to write about his unhappiness with hearing Spanish spoken in public places. Finding an audience, he fomented about rising crime rates, rising taxes to pay for services for the newcomers, overcrowded dwellings, music played too loud, fast driving, and so on. He included Latino crime reports from the local police blotter. He even claimed armed members of the Mexican revolutionary group Zapatistas were moving to Prince William County.\" - Roger Ebert", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oQuSJvzQtIEirPY7VcRwEapdS8O.jpg", "actors": ["Alanna Almeda (Herself)", "Charlie T.
