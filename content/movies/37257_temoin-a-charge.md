C'est \u00e0 ce moment que Leonard Vole, accus\u00e9 du meurtre de Mme French, vient lui demander son aide. Bien que l'affaire paraisse passionnante, Sir Wilfrid refuse de s'en occuper pour pr\u00e9server sa sant\u00e9 et conseille un autre avocat, Mr Brogan-Moore, un de ses anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9part de Leonard Vole du bureau de Sir Wilfrid, Christine Vole, la femme de Leonard, fait son apparition. Elle est son seul alibi pour le soir du meurtre. Son attitude tr\u00e8s froide et son r\u00f4le crucial dans l'affaire font changer Sir Wilfrid d'avis, qui d\u00e9cide malgr\u00e9 les recommandations des m\u00e9decins de s'occuper de cette affaire fascinante.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nM0L28AL9NfK7Ru3cBFzrhZVzMW.jpg", "actors": ["Tyrone Power (Leonard Vole)", "Marlene Dietrich (Christine Vole)", "Charles Laughton (Sir Wilfrid Robarts)", "Elsa Lanchester (Miss Plimsoll)", "John Williams (Brogan-Moore)", "Henry Daniell (Mayhew)", "Ian Wolfe (Carter)", "Torin Thatcher (Mr. Myers)", "Norma Varden (Emily Jane French)", "Una O'Connor (Janet McKenzie)", "Francis Compton (Judge)", "Philip Tonge (Inspector Hearne)", "Ruta Lee (Diana)", "Bess Flowers (Courtroom spectator)", "Leoda Richards (Hat Store Sales Clerk)", "Patrick Aherne (Court Officer (uncredited))", "Eddie Baker (Courtroom Spectator (uncredited))", "Brandon Beach (Juror (uncredited))", "Colin Kenny (Juror (uncredited))", "Fred Rapport (Juror (uncredited))", "Danny Borzage (Courtroom Spectator (uncredited))", "George Bruggeman (Courtroom Spectator (uncredited))", "Steve Carruthers (Courtroom Spectator (uncredited))", "Stuart Hall (Courtroom Spectator (uncredited))", "Art Howard (Courtroom Spectator (uncredited))", "Paul Kruger (Courtroom Spectator (uncredited))", "Jeanne Lafayette (Courtroom Spectator (uncredited))", "Wilbur Mack (Courtroom Spectator (uncredited))", "John Roy (Courtroom Spectator (uncredited))", "Scott Seaton (Courtroom Spectator (uncredited))", "Cap Somers (Courtroom Spectator (uncredited))", "Bert Stevens (Courtroom Spectator (uncredited))", "Arthur Tovey (Courtroom Spectator (uncredited))", "Glen Walters (Courtroom Spectator (uncredited))", "Marjorie Eaton (Miss O'Brien (uncredited))", "Franklyn Farnum (Barrister (uncredited))", "William H.

But _Tyrone Power_ and _Marlene Dietrich_ were convincing too in their portrayal of an _innocent, afraid for his life man and a disloyal, unloving, poker faced wife_ respectively.\r\n\r\nSome people might say that they predicted the ending half way down the movie but i am not quite sure as to how they predicted the **ACTUAL ENDING** before it really unfolded before their eyes?\r\n\r\nThis movie is great not only in the part played in court but also in the scenes shot in _Sir Wilfrid Robarts's_ office(also due to _Miss Plimsoll's caringly lovably irritating character!_).\r\n\r\nPerhaps the people(the minority I'd like to believe) who don't think this movie deserves the high ranking and rating that it's got saw this brilliant piece of art as more of a suspense thriller.But I loved this movie as a delightfully ENTERTAINING, MYSTERIOUS, DRAMA !\r\n\r\nI rate this 10 just because I haven't seen any other CLASSIC courtroom drama that was intense throughout(barring some light hearted scenes with Sir Wilfrid Robarts) and yet in the end I somehow felt light-hearted and had a smile on my face rather than a thought provoking look on it.\r\n\r\nThe commentary in the ending credits was innocently adorable for our times of social networking _\"The management of this theater suggests that for the greater entertainment of your friends who have not yet seen the picture you will not divulge to anyone the secret of the ending of Witness for the Prosecution!\"_\r\n\r\nAnd mind you I am a _big fan of 12 Angry Men and How to Kill a Mockingbird!_ But this movie too is equally good in a different way altogether!"}], "recommandations_id": [996, 599, 93, 3090]}
