Reversing the usual procedure in late-1960s films, Dixon decides to quit school and enlist in the Army, even though he's already run afoul of the law as a Vietnam protestor. It is our hero's intention to use love, rather than bullets, to combat the Viet Cong. Needless to say, his idealism is no match for the harsher realities of war, but this doesn't stop him from endlessly spouting the sort of agit-prop rhetoric so beloved of filmmakers of the era. In addition to Michael Douglas, co-star Peter Strauss likewise makes his first film appearance in Hail, Hero! Dated in the extreme, the film is saved by the musical score by Gordon Lightfoot.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rQB4Br9Jc39grZ7fyQm1DzcLTKj.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Douglas (Carl Dixon)", "Arthur Kennedy (Albert Dixon)", "Teresa Wright (Santha Dixon)", "Peter Strauss (Frank Dixon)", "Louise Latham (Miss Mirabel)", "John Larch (Mr. Conklin)", "Charles Drake (Senator Murchiston)", "Virginia Christine (Eleanor Murchiston)", "John Qualen (Billy Hurd)", "Carmen Zapata (Juana)", "Deborah Winters (Becky)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
