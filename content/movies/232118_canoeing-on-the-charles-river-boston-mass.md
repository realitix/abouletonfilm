A flotilla of canoes passes by. Some have one occupant, some two, a few three or four. Some men wear ties, a few wear boaters. Only a handful of the canoes have more than one paddler. None go quickly. There are more than 40 canoes packed close together. Off camera, down left, they seem to make a circle and head back to enter the frame from the left.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
