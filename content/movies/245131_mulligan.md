The largely unknown cast features Steve Lattery, Alex Cole, Cedric Yabrough and Joshua Will.  The foursome play a free-wheeling, competitive style of golf, frequently making use of the \"mulligan\" ( golfing for 'do over'), a technique each of them, not surprisingly, begin to regularly utilize in their everyday (non-golfing) comings-and-goings, with predictably disastrous results.  Eventually, the foursome has difficulty separating golf from their real lives, along with the realization that they really don't like each other that much. A shared enemy serves to reunite the once-happy group however, and they drive off into the sunset on golf carts.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Steve Lattery (Jordan)", "Joshua Will (Langer)", "Cedric Yarbrough (King)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
