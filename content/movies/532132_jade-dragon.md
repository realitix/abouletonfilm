He goes on a drunken rampage on the streets of Hong Kong. Polly, an aspiring artist and language teacher, runs into him and ends up a victim. The experience shatters her confidence, turning her into a hopeless wreck. Encouraged by Kyra, a teenage girl, she reluctantly begins to learn kung fu, training under Ming Yu, who herself hopes to be taught by legendary Wing Chun Grandmaster Wan Kam Leung. Polly's life improves, but learning a few self defense moves somehow isn't enough. Unaware of the connection between her attacker and Ming Yu, Polly sets out to claim back what was stolen from her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8EdMz8X9ryqhxuRkJJhwSTBHzMK.jpg", "actors": ["Kalina Benhamou (Kyra)", "Minna Cheung (Polly)", "Rita Ho (Ming Yu)", "Wan Kam Leung (Himself)", "Marc Ngan (Danny)", "Jeffrey Truong (Jimmy)", "Vimal Vaz (Rufus)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
