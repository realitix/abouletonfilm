It is in the peaceful quiet that follows a crash that the banal becomes beautiful and mundane monumental.  As the woman hangs injured and suspended from her seatbelt in the upside down car, she observes beautiful wildlife in the landscape around her and her tragic situation seems at once disconnected from and yet interwoven with the beauty surrounding her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/teIwOow4nCHqHWiziWyYnWioCjC.jpg", "actors": ["Amanda Dawn Christie (Person hanging upside down in car)", "Moncton Fire Dept.
