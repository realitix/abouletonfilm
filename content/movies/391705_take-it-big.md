When he heads to the Great Outdoors to take possession, Jack winds up at the wrong place: a swanky dude ranch. He immediately begins running things, at it's quite a while before his error is discovered. By the time he shows up at his own ranch, he's up to his ears in unpaid debts-which naturally requires a fund-raising musical show as a bail-out. Harriet Hilliard handles the romantic portion of the proceedings, occasionally dueting with her real-life husband, bandleader Ozzie Nelson.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7kKxrdwrv5llZBheKimxJKIvGtn.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Haley (Jack North)", "Harriet Hilliard (Jerry Clinton)", "Mary Beth Hughes (Gaye Livingston)", "Richard Lane (Eddie Hampton)", "Arline Judge (Pert Martin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
