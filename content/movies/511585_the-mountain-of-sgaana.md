Haida filmmaker Christopher Auchter\u2019s dream-like gem brilliantly entwines traditional animation with formal elements of Haida art, which are brought to life by a rich, evocative palette and stylized effects.  As a young fisherman cruises along a rugged shoreline, a tiny mouse in Haida regalia appears and starts to knit a blanket. A story unfolds on the blanket as it grows longer, illustrating the ancient tale of Haida master sea hunter Naa-Naa-Simgat and his beloved, Kuuga Kuns. When a sGaana (the Haida word for \u201ckiller whale\u201d) captures the hunter and drags him down into a supernatural world, the courageous Kuuga Kuns sets off to save him.  Will the lovers manage to escape the undersea Mountain of SGaana, or will they, too, become part of the Haida spirit world forever?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nWiqG7ULtbunRNmmr3wgRzD6hjY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
