Sculptures, drawings, text, and original music are used to explore the late 19th century\u2019s evolution of painting, literature, and theatre into early photography and moving pictures. The piece probes the interplay of art and science and in exploring these ideas certain lives and themes are touched upon \u2013 the relationship between John Ruskin and Lewis Carroll, Ruskin\u2019s theories on drawing, Thomas Eakins\u2019 painting and his use of photography, the burgeoning of early cinema with Eadweard Muybridge and Etienne-Jules Marey, notions of amateurism and professionalism in art and the archetype of the condemned artist. The work is presented in two acts, remaining faithful to the musical\u2019s original construction based upon Carroll\u2019s narratives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7zKOHqU1VFZB0FwhsrrBjtlTXJ0.jpg", "actors": ["Sarah Evans (Alice)", "Lauren Goode (White Rabbit)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
