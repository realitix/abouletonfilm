The husband, although saved from drowning, loses his memory. A child is on the way, and soon a daughter is born to his wife. We watch the passage of time, as his daughter matures and his wife ages. The daughter becomes a lovely young woman, herself ready for marriage. One day on the beach, the familiarity of the sea and the surroundings triggers a return of her father's memory, and we are reminded that although people age and change, the sea and the ways of the fisherfolk remain eternal.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hKzeqkgnCvnWwNv0dvc3YqRKk1u.jpg", "actors": ["Arthur V.
