Inside, it is like a small city, with businesses and services abound. The prisoners make their living inside the enclosure as they would outside. There is a strong self-organization that plans every-body's lives. As if it weren't enough, there are hundreds of women, wives of the inmates, and almost 300 children, who chose to share their captivity. They are non-convicted beings that accepted living behind bars with the only purpose of preserving a united family. The documentary shows the life of a family inside the jail of La Paz.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iUfQoOAhrzU3IotVonQb1TQbvTC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
