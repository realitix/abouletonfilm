Inspired by this fact, the movie investigates the theft of the author\u00b4s identity in a ghostly Rio de Janeiro and in deep transformation. If in fiction and in crime sections of newspapers it\u2019s common to read about people who steal the identity of someone dead to start a new life, what we have here is the opposite case: someone who steals the identity of a living man to die in his place.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gKBnkBIaOBkzuwrkQ4OzMdiHwgh.jpg", "actors": ["Jo\u00e3o Paulo Cuenca ()", "Ana Flavia Cavalcanti ()", "Leonilce Torato ()", "Geraldo Margella ()", "Fabio Roque ()", "Paulo Pires ()", "Ivo Raposo ()", "Marilza Solange de Carvalho ()", "Renisson Raimundo Santos ()", "Willian Alves ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
