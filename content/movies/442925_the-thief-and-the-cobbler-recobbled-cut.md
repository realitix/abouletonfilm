Still a work in progress, this has been \"cobbled\" together from the many existing cuts to bring the film closer to its original form.  Nearly the entire film has been carefully restored frame by frame in Photoshop, After Effects, Final Cut Pro and other programs, with scenes recreated to tell the story like never before. Dirt and splices have been removed and new special effects created.  The aim of the Recobbled Cut is to provide the most complete and watchable version that is faithful to Richard Williams' vision, using the best available quality audio and video.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5xRt9x3HKqtsgeR5Jh35PST6xas.jpg", "actors": ["Vincent Price (Zigzag (voice))", "Anthony Quayle (King Nod (voice))", "Hilary Pritchard (Princess Yumyum (voice))", "Felix Aylmer (Narrator)", "Joan Sims (Nurse/Witch (voice))", "Windsor Davies (Chief Roofless (voice))", "Paul Matthews (Mighty One Eye (voice))", "Clinton Sundberg (Dying Soldier (voice))", "Donald Pleasence (Phido the Vulture (voice))", "Kenneth Williams (Goblet/Tickle (voice))", "Stanley Baxter (Gofer/Slap)", "George Melly (Dwarf)", "Eddie Byrne (Hoof (voice))", "Stanley Baxter (Gofer/Slap (voice))", "George Melly (Dwarf (voice))", "Thick Wilson (Hook (voice))", "Frederick Shaw (Goolie (voice))", "Miriam Margolyes (Maiden from Mombassa (voice))", "Sean Connery (Tack the Cobbler (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "fJry5ReXZVM"}
