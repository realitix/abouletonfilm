Two love bugs head off to a more private area. But their fun is interrupted when a crow comes by. He bottles up the male bug and chases the female into her home. The male bug escapes in the nick of time, and another bug notices the battle and rallies the rest of the bugs to attack, which they do, using false teeth, an eggbeater, a mousetrap, castor oil, and other things.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/79ygTfVL2qbQlEekyiSZHpjE8lJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [67573, 67585, 67602, 93627], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
