Soon, she's on the trail of a cruel gang that specializes in white slavery, and she's not the only person trying to bring them down.

The first and second act move at a snail's pace with drawn-out dialogue / exposition scenes that really don't add up or go anywhere. The camera work is boring, being shot in the typical bland, \"flat\" look of 90's action films. Only this was made in 2003, so there's little excuse for that. And Burt Reynolds' bizarrely random cameo only added to the incoherence.\r\n\r\nDaniel Bernhardt is always awesome, though he's not in the movie much. He does have a cage fight with Matthias Hues at one point, but it's done pretty poorly so there's nothing much to see.\r\n\r\nHowever, the climax is fairly well done for this budget and genre and definitely helped save it from being a complete waste of time."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
