If he could feel in the past as one of the most influential writers of his generation, he has long lacked ideas and impetus for a new great work. His reading tours are becoming more and more a sad affair with too much alcohol and too little public. Then Paul overflows in a drunken hitchhiker, flees first scared and later removes the body, without talking to anyone about the experience. But something is flowing in its interior. Paul starts to write again. The criticism is done, but the story about the death of a hitchhiker also arouses suspicion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nAX7CrOgpnBLDxH9uL29XgDTsdW.jpg", "actors": ["Henry H\u00fcbchen (Paul Bacher)", "Patrycia Ziolkowska (Teresa Fl\u00f6\u00dfer)", "Jenny Schily (Hannah Komarek)", "Jordan Elliot Dwyer (Daniel Becker)", "Michael Schenk (Wolf Kommarek)", "Tom Sommerlatte (Navin Flagel)", "Nora Hickler (Tatjana)", "Carolin Wiedenbr\u00f6ker (Alvara Hollerbach)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
