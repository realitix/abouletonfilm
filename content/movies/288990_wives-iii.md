This episodic film begins with flashbacks to the 1975 film Wives and scenes from 1985's Wives: Ten Years Later. Now ten more years have passed and they are comfortably ensconced in middle age. They have gathered to hold a surprise birthday for Kaja aboard an Oslo streetcar. The three haven't seen each other in ages and much of the story focuses on their discussions of their disparate lives. Every word, smile and tear they share affirms the depth of their lasting friendship.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f9Yk4RI93zEqSRz8KarEOxCNgMe.jpg", "actors": ["Anne Marie Ottersen (Mie)", "Fr\u00f8ydis Armand (Heidrun)", "Katja Medb\u00f8e (Kaja)", "N\u00f8ste Schwab (Kaja's mother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
