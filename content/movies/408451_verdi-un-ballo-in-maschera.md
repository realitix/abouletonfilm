With Reri Grist (Oscar), Placido Domingo (Gustavus), Katia Ricciarelli (Amelia), Piero Cappucili (Renato), Patricia Payne (? - the booklet or DVD fails to credit the singer) (Ulrica) and Claudio Abbado in the pit: all at their peak, you just simply cannot go wrong when purchasing this DVD. This performance made me realise why I had fallen in love with opera: beautiful (today one should be thankful) and convincing sets and costumes, and fiery conducting and singing from all the above soloists which leaves you breathless. Domingo as the King (not the Governor of Boston) is simply ravishing! He is so convincing and dashing as Gustavus - I think very few tenors nowadays can even attempt such a convincing vocal and dramatic performance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fprZ7FAW6twgYfkXv48DBhbZmD3.jpg", "actors": ["Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (Gustavo III)", "Katia Ricciarelli (Amelia)", "Piero Cappuccilli (Anckarstroem)", "Reri Grist (Oscar)", "Patricia Payne (Ulrica)", "Elizabeth Bainbridge (Mlle.
