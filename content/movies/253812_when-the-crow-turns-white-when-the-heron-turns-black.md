It is more than a love story. It is also a commentary - a satire rich with humor injected into a moral, psychological, sociological, and cultural aspect, outlook, and values of the said bygone era. It is a poignant rich-girl-meets poor boy love story of Julie Monserat and Candido Ventura - two love-struck starry eyed youths who fought for their right to love each other, here is a story that touches social conflict - the perennial clashes and discrimination between the rich and the poor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jaSbmKolAyrLHPVW0v3aNjbZJR8.jpg", "actors": ["Vilma Santos (Julie Monserrat)", "Bembol Roco (Dido (as Bembol Roco Jr.))", "Robert Talabis (Claro)", "Joonee Gamboa (Maestro Roque)", "Angie Ferro (Miguela Monserrat)", "Olivia O'Hara (Cristy)", "Mona Lisa (Diding)", "Mario Escudero (Hepe)", "Adul de Leon (Beatrice Monserrat)", "Fred Panopio (Dido's Friend)", "Bino Garcia Jr. (as)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
