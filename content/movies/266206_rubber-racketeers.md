With rationing in effect the black market tire business is booming. Gillen's mob sets up car lots around town where they peddle stolen tires and \"new\" tires milled in the gangster's factories from cheap faulty materials. People begin to die in crashes as the defective tires fail. Bill Barry leads his fellow defense plant workers on a crusade to uncover the source of the black market rubber and bring the guilty to justice.  Although clearly intended to warn the public about black market tire smuggling, Rubber Racketeers holds it own as a saga of mobsters versus an irate public.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pi7hhJETQcg93mJ9Gv1ColcZHOx.jpg", "actors": ["Ricardo Cortez (Gilin)", "Rochelle Hudson (Nikki)", "William Henry (Bill Barry (as Bill Henry))", "Barbara Read (Mary Dale)", "John Abbott (Dumbo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "_qGoW-vKiFQ"}
