He has a very ill child to take care of who requires expensive and special treatments that are not covered by the state medical system. When he loses his job in the inevitable downsizing, he is approached by a sinister rich man to perform various off-the-books services for him, including spying on the rich man's wife. Reluctantly, he accepts the role of \"friend\" to this untrustworthy fellow. His child is becoming steadily worse, so when the requests of his \"friend\" include violent and unlawful actions, he does not feel able to refuse him outright.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oT2tbddDEb6kS3tmLXsWvls72id.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
