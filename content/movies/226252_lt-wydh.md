The landlord is desperately trying to force them out to the point of enlisting the devil\u2019s help. Like \u201cAl-Ins wal Djinn,\u201d the film\u2019s opening scenes establish a sense of tension that continues to mount until, for some reason, a goat shoots a star-shaped laser out of its forehead, and everything quickly falls apart. Furniture spontaneously combusts, an invisible presence settles in Mahmoud\u2019s apartment, and the devil rapes his wife and she thinks it\u2019s an earthquake. Things reach their peak when, for the second time on this list, Yousra is drenched in actual chicken blood.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pQjSIZ6kAj9WOlRJPRk2alAit3f.jpg", "actors": ["Naima El Soghier (Sorceress)", "Abla Kamel (Faten)", "Mahmoud Yassine (Mahmoud)", "Taheya Cariocca (Om Mahmoud)", "Fouad Khalil ()", "Yousra (Rawya)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
