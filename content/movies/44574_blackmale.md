{"tmdb_id": 44574, "title": "Blackmale", "original_title": "Blackmale", "slug_title": "blackmale", "date": "2000-05-11", "genre": ["Action / Com\u00e9die"], "score": "4.4/10", "synopsis": "The Plot is actually pretty crafty and full of (surprisingly) unsuspecting twists. The special effects are actually quite realistic which is surprising for such a low budget movie. Bokeeem Woodbine plays his role with a serious emotion that only adds to the hilariousness of the movie. Justin Pierce (R.I.P) is hilarious as a guy who has possibly the worst day of his entire life. The comedy of the movie culminates in the final 10 minutes that have had me and everyone else watching the movie rolling on the floor for hours. This movie is a classic and deserves more respect.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4Z6xnqx1lSrikXRklsOWi1R7rVd.jpg", "actors": ["Bokeem Woodbine ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
