Since 2009, he has been incorporating synthesized electronic sounds into his compositions alongside his fluid piano parts, drawing comparisons to Radiohead. Support tonight comes from Agnes Obel, a Danish singer-songwriter who makes haunting, intricately harmonised, piano-led songs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w0rFQGi9DYKLtircjsxawioJPNY.jpg", "actors": ["Ludovico Einaudi (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
