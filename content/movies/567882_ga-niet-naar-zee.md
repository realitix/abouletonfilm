When a lone wolf finds a balloon with a note attached, he seizes the opportunity to pass on his hard-learned life lessons to the unknown infant that sent it. Lessons that do not necessarily line up with a pre-schooler\u2019s experiences, but which may be valuable to him or her at a later age. In the process, unconnected generations find each other in this moving short film, based on a story by Tommy Wieringa.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lJ3PUZgcVVrmsqR7t0ZzYI74LJa.jpg", "actors": ["Julia Akkermans ()", "Johan Leysen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
