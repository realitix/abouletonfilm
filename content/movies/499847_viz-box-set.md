Making a successful leap from the pages of the infamous comic to the small screen, Northeastern misogynist 'Sid the Sexist' is out to abuse and verbally batter the female sex, utilizing every clich\u00e9 chat-up line in existence, labeling all non-takers as lesbians. 'Oh Lordy, It's The Fat Slags,' follows Tracy and Sandra - two portly young women who wear nothing that is less than cling-film tight, are forever on the lookout for sex and chips and are, essentially, Sid The Sexist's female alter ego. 'Roger Mellie, The Man On The Telly,' features the star anchor man of Fulchester Television, a foul-mouthed lecherous alcoholic trying to make it as a smooth-tongued TV presenter. 'Billy The Fish,' features another Viz favourite - a spoof on the old Victor and Hotspur comics' football heroes - only this one is a tiny fish with a soccer player mullet.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AqmQ7QDH0tmcJshtvBzg8OSo0O5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
