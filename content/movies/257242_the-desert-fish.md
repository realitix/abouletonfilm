As in classic childhood stories, we witness the fusion of magic, tragedy, young love, and the trials of adolescence woven into a powerful tale of redemption. With subtle notes of man\u2019s responsibility to nature, in a world where nature is turning against us, The Desert Fish ultimately reveals how much a child will sacrifice for a chance at happiness, and how much we will have to sacrifice for our future.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wFkCqLKGjOJZObCx6kstnBGI3i9.jpg", "actors": ["Iman Afshar (Ahmad)", "Ayoub Afshar (Abbas)", "Ronak Younesi (Mahi Khatoon)", "Mohsen Hosseini (Toufan)", "Bahar Adi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
