And this, even though Baron von Wehrhahn, who is loyal to the prince, does everything possible to make \u201chis Highness\u201d popular. The only problem is, he\u2019s always using his zeal on the wrong crowd. He always seems to see free-thinkers or revolutionaries in the harmless of citizens; but the really bad ones get to go on their way unmolested! For example, the old woman Wolff: she steals everything that isn\u2019t nailed down, while her husband pursues unhampered poaching.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/GSUBE8hg7jb5b0AgHLXkWqW3Zx.jpg", "actors": ["Heinrich George (Amtsvorsteher Baron von Wehrhahn)", "Ida W\u00fcst (Auguste Wolff)", "Blandine Ebinger (Frau Kr\u00fcger)", "Fritz Odemar (F\u00fcrst August Sigismund)", "Walter Bluhm (Schreiber Glasenapp)", "Heinz von Cleve (Konstrukteur Dr. Fleischer)", "Sabine Peters (Leontine Wolff)", "Rotraut Richter (Adelheid Wolff)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
