If you\u2019re not familiar with the drummer, producer, composer, francofunkateer amongst countless other titles and roles, he\u2019s kind of a god, on par with Giorgio Moroder, Nile Rodgers and the like. Pitchfork has gathered raw concert footage and interview with Rodgers, Bob Sinclar, Dave Haslam and the man himself (who chalks-up his fascination with electric music numbers to seeing Jimi Hendrix perform live in Paris as a teenager) to delve into the mans incalculable contribution to the DNAs of dance floor freakers and pop music alike (sampling years before it was adopted as hip-hop\u2019s hammer and nail) and how he came to be so cherished by the greater funk cannon.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Marc Cerrone ()", "Nile Rodgers ()", "Bob Sinclar ()", "Dave Haslam ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "8sbJ-oZmkrw"}
