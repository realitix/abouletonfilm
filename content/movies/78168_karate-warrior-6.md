For instance, what happened in the first five Karate Warrior movies? This dude acquired a super powered punch that allowed him to beat up a cow. What now? Clearly, we have a lot of catching up to do with Karate Warrior Anthony!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6kS9JOm3ShaCC2xHjbUFyARCfLZ.jpg", "actors": ["Ron Williams (Larry Jones)", "Gabriella Barbuti (Elena)", "R.
