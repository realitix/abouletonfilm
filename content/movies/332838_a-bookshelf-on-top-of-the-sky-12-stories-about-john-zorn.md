Filmed over a ten year period, this documentary includes live footage of Masada, Naked City, Cobra, as well as improvisations, his classical work and rare interviews. A prize winner at European festivals, this film documents Heuermann's very personal, fifteen year odyssey with the music of John Zorn. At times frightening, at times hilarious, at times frighteningly hilarious.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uObWraouKK7O1b3Ttrl2QVP7Dv8.jpg", "actors": ["John Zorn (Himself)", "Fred Frith (Himself)", "Mike Patton (Himself)", "Ikue Mori (Herself)", "Yamatsuka Eye (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
