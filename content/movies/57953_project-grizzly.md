The film documents Hurtubise's diligent work to improve his homemade \"grizzly-proof\" suit of armour, his efforts to test its resilience, and his forays into the Rockies to track down the grizzlies he dreams of meeting. The film manages to capture the humor of the project as well as its sincerity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wZTa0PbXstTOZAbbOeWUUdiwZp.jpg", "actors": ["Troy Hurtubise (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [243866, 25637, 162873, 57217], "youtube_key": "sLUdtF7aG7o"}
