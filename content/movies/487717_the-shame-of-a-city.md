In 2003 filmmaker Tigre Hill chronicled the Philadelphia mayoral race between Democrat incumbent mayor, John Street and Republican challenger Sam Katz. Early polls showed Katz with a small lead. Hill had inside access to the Katz campaign and although rebuffed by the Street campaign, managed to get footage. Twenty-seven days before the election an FBI bug was found in the mayor s office. It looked like 1904 all over again-blatant corruption. The discovery of the bug at first seemed like a death knell to the Street campaign and a near certain victory for Katz. How did the mayor react to the bug? This powerful documentary shows how-drum up support by polarizing the electorate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lBNvTnKUQzjMqcZnGqz69d6wyRJ.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Clinton (Himself)", "Bill Cosby (Himself)", "James Carville (Himself)", "Rudolph Giuliani (Himself)", "John F.
