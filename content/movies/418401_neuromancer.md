The Matrix is a world within the world, a global consensus- hallucination, the representation of every byte of data in cyberspace . . .  Case had been the sharpest data-thief in the business, until vengeful former employers crippled his nervous system. But now a new and very mysterious employer recruits him for a last-chance run.
