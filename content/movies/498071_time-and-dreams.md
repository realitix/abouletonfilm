The filmmaker has described \u201cTime and Dreams\u201d as a personal journey back to his Alabama home, where he contrasts two societies: the nostalgia some residents have for past values versus the deferred dreams of those who are well past waiting for their time to fully participate in the promise of their own dreams. Through vignettes and personal testimonies, the film portrays Greene County, Alabama, as its people move toward understanding and cooperation in a time of social change.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nkbs2URkWIMs2iPljbaemtZHYOs.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
