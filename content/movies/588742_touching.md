He was injured seven years ago, and has been with his partner for the last three years. There are only two areas below his shoulders in which he can experience any feeling; one is underneath the coronal ridge of his penis and the other is the area immediately around his anus.  The relationship of the couple is warm, full, intimate, and satisfying. It is clearly a film of effective sexual functioning, and is one of the warmest films we have had the opportunity to make. The man manually and orally stimulates the woman, helping her move through the sexual response cycle several times to orgasm. Body changes such as breast enlargement and development of the vascular trees in the breasts are quite evident. She pleasures him by orally and manually stimulating his penis and anus.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
