It consists of a live concert recorded at the Ice House in Fullerton, California, as well as interviews with the band members and an overview of their history. The original version was released both on CD and VHS. With most of their back catalogue out of print, the album and video were seen as a retrospective of the band's past, as performed by its most recent stable lineup.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bM1wEJng38npc7HGnLLgES5FIq8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
