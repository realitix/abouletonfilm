He calls on her, and although she will not talk to him about her life, his visit sends her to her chest of Bol\u00edvar's letters. As she reads them, the sepia-toned present gives way to flashbacks in color: she meets 'the Liberator' in 1822, becomes his lover, and also becomes a colonel in his military movement to realize the 'Gran Colombia', one nation across South America. As plague (brought by the ship) closes in on Manuela's household, so does her tempestuous story move toward Bol\u00edvar's betrayal and death.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bhVKP0iMZq5e13dhShXOSmihO4E.jpg", "actors": ["Beatriz Vald\u00e9s (Manuela)", "Mariano \u00c1lvarez (Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar)", "Erich Wildpret (Herman Melville)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
