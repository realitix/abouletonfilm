He's retrieved a letter she dropped and wants to return it to her, but it's pretty clear that his interest extends beyond mere politeness. (She's the adorable young Bebe Daniels, so this is easy to understand.) The movie studio setting provides Harold with lots of opportunities to do what comedians do in comedies like this one: flirt with actresses, anger the studio brass, and dash through sets disrupting everything.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Harold Lloyd (The Boy)", "'Snub' Pollard (The New Director)", "Bebe Daniels (The Leading Lady)", "William Blaisdell ()", "James Blyler ()", "Jane Blyler ()", "Corinne Bradford ()", "Florence Brewster ()", "Sammy Brooks (Short Prop Man)", "Harry Clifton ()", "Lige Conley ()", "Genevieve Cunningham ()", "Billy Fay ()", "William Gillespie (Actor)", "Helen Gilmore ()", "Max Hamburger ()", "Estelle Harrison ()", "Lew Harvey ()", "June Havoc (Child)", "Maynard Laswell ()", "Gus Leonard (Bearded Actor)", "Marvin Loback ()", "Chris Lynton ()", "M.J.
