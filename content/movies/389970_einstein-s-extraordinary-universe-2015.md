Black holes, time travel, and the Big Bang beginning of our universe are all consequences of Einstein's great theory.  To celebrate, we visit three 'big physics' facilities: CERN's Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland; the vast dark matter laboratories under a mountain in Italy; and two three-kilometre rooms where scientists are hoping to prove a prediction Einstein made over a century ago - that gravitational waves exist. Don't miss this celebration of Einstein's Extraordinary Universe", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/29ayXQdX2Qpjgsgh51JhFuEFgcE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
