Katie Lee was a spitfire activist, river goddess and folk-singing warrior for wild places. And when she passed away at the age of 98, she left behind a legacy as big as the Grand Canyon. This short film pays homage to a life shaped by redrock canyons, sinuous rivers, monkey-wrenching mischief and uninhibited passion.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
