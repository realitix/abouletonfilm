Despite the serious subject matter, there's wit and humor in this brave film's recounting of the ups and downs of the relationship, which are depicted with admirable honesty. And, perhaps most importantly, there's a happy ending.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5KXnAKlEcZJoPFNQYQgElq1tGu7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
