Remarkably, the society they create is pure communist. Interviews with the show's creator and some of the surviving actors, as well from professors from Harvard, reveal that Gilligan's Island was deliberately designed to be dismissed as low brow comedy in order to celebrate Marxism and lampoon Western democratic constructs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f7SF0xFThT9c0dz4IsOytkaKc4l.jpg", "actors": ["Russell Johnson (Himself)", "Dawn Wells (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
