The small operation struggles to compete with the ornate sidewalk diner run by Leonard's father. Leonard is too engrossed in his comic book to pay attention to waiting customers, and when they leave he whines to his father, who gets a policeman to force Gus and Scotty from their corner. Buckwheat's father, a boot black, offers Gus room to set up his stand, while Spanky, Alfalfa, and the other kids stage a parade and an impromptu talent show to draw customers to Gus's booth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4HOZQU9b1STG0mhw858OLxZqufJ.jpg", "actors": ["Scotty Beckett (Scotty)", "George McFarland (Spanky)", "Carl Switzer (Alfalfa)", "Billie Thomas (Buckwheat)", "Pete the Pup (Pete)", "Gloria Browne (Gloria)", "Alvin Buckelew (Alvin, drum player)", "Marianne Edwards (Marianne)", "Leonard Kibrick (Leonard)", "Billy Mindy (Boy in Sailor Suit)", "Donald Proffitt (Our Gang member)", "Merrill Strong (Our Gang member)", "Harold Switzer (Harold)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
