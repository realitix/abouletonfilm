At the end of the 50s he got to know Oskar Sala (1910-2002) and took advantage of the composers electro-acoustic and musical skills in many of his subsequent black and white motion pictures. Thus, Durniok could concentrate on images and editing sequences of his movies without having to worry about live sound. The soundtrack subsequently created by Sala has always been a free, electronically-abstract composition with a strong rhythmic and tonal reference to sequence and image content.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
