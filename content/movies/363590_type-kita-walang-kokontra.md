Primo, on the other hand, asked his cop cousin Victor to pretend to be him for he lacks enough confidence to woo his foreign lover. Victor, who is very much focused on doing his job perfectly, thoughtlessly granted his cousin\u2019s request. However, as Victor gets to spend time with Isabel, he finds himself diverting his concerns in finding out if Isabel is the right woman for him. Isabel, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t help but fall in love with Victor too.
