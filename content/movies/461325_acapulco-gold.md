{"tmdb_id": 461325, "title": "Acapulco Gold", "original_title": "Acapulco Gold", "slug_title": "acapulco-gold", "date": "1973-01-01", "genre": ["Documentaire"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "A flighty, dull peek at the underground marijuana distribution system of the early 1970s, complete with tie dye, VW buses and a soft-focused romp through fields of hemp at sunset. Stereotypically '70s in almost every fashion, it's shot on cheap stock with a bad soundtrack, boring subjects and jumpy editing. It's interesting in a purely historical sense, as we get a pretty good idea of where law enforcement stood in regards to the substance a decade before Nancy Reagan instituted the war on drugs, but viewers out for a bit more insight are due to be sorely disappointed. It's cool to see the narrator reach out of a moving car to grab a fistful of buds off of a roadside plant, but that's about the extent of the excitement.
