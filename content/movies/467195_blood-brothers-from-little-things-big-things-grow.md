He has performed with Paul Kelly and Billy Bragg, both of whom appear in this film. When Kev released his first album, Pillars of Society, in 1989, music magazine Rolling Stone described it as \"the best album ever released by an Aborigine and arguably the best protest album ever made in Australia\". Kev was propelled onto the national stage as a voice of protest for black Australia. This film looks at Kev up close - cattle mustering in southern Queensland, making music in suburban Sydney and playing Long Bay Jail.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o1Hg0BtKeKAoerHBblTCseKpLfS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
