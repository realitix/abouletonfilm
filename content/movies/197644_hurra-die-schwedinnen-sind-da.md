He gave him money to buy a hotel, and for this Nikki should marry his daughter Marianne. And the catch is not even that the daughter of the Bavarian city head is a mulatto, but the fact that Nicky does not want to be bound by marriage to anyone. Buddy Tony throws the poor guy the idea of \u200b\u200btaking a loan, giving money to the burgomaster and sending him away with his daughter. However, to say is not to do. To knock out a loan is a complicated matter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a9cmbQTxZfAIRL3i7qOpbUDlUEI.jpg", "actors": ["Scarlett Gunden (Marianne)", "Corinne Brodbeck (Betty)", "Bea Fiedler (Iris)", "Renate Langer (Antje)", "Erich Padalewski (Oskar)", "Wolf Goldan (Niki Moser)", "Rosl Mayr (Josefa)", "Werner R\u00f6glin (Eginhardt Kuehl)", "J\u00fcrgen Schilling (Tony)", "Margot Mahler (Wilma)", "Heinz Reincke (Heinz)", "Corinna Genest (Olga)", "Jacques Herlin (Hugo Wiesinger)", "Marie Luise Lusewitz (Rosl)", "Otto Retzer ()", "Josef Moosholzer (Sepp Huber)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
