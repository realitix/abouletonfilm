We are in familiar territory here, a bunch of annoying teenagers go out in the woods today and head for a big surprise. In fact the story twists quite early on and has great potential, landing the narrative in a sort of torture porn revenger universe, but the makers then rely far too heavy on this aspect and the dialogue is only matched in banality quotient by the plot holes. \r\n\r\nEven the brutality factor quickly gets boring, it\u2019s like covering for inadequacies elsewhere by thrusting the violence to the front to try and save the movie. However, it\u2019s not a total washout. There\u2019s a trio of jumping-bean performances that remain entertaining throughout their respective stays, and a flip-flop device has some worth even if we have absolutely no affinity for any of these people at all.\r\n\r\nA tough film to recommend to anyone but the staunchest torture porn/revenger fan, because ultimately it\u2019s failings elsewhere are hurtful to the audience\u2019s viewing experience. 4/10"}], "recommandations_id": [27588, 101669, 132064, 55861], "youtube_key": "gJuuz1LHhRM"}
