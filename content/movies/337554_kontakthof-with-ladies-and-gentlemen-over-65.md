They rehearsed for over a year and the premiere took place in the early 2000s in Wuppertal. Lilo Mangelsdorff has accompanied this exceptional project with a camera. The result is a touching film, which focuses on the dancers' stand with their fears and inhibitions, their enthusiasm and passion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hHxbD7EnS7wLaeVeZ2RhPFSP9oe.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "6cyNC8uvzBg"}
