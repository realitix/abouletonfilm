The case was one of the first that shined a spotlight on what many called the \"legal lynchings\" that occurred in the South whenever blacks were accused of crimes, especially against whites and most especially against white women.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jTvcOnMq95UbZ5julOXTD0l0oAt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [113377], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
