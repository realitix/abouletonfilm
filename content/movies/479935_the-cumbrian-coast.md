Firstly, we board a North West Regional Railways Express (class 156) which traverses the former Furness Railway via Grange-over-Sands and Ulvertston to Barrow-in-Furness.  There we change to a class 153 for the most scenic section of the route along the coast from Bootle to Maryport, filmed in what can only be described as 100% perfect weather - not a cloud in the sky! Apparently you only get one day a year like that along the coast and we were there!  As signalling expert David Allen says in his script; \"this line is a mecca for semaphore signalling enthusiasts\".  Filmed in 1997.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p1RoWdIRVvTcHazhtUbYdfQnWXv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
