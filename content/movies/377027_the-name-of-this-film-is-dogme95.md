The film tells how a 'brotherhood' of four Danish directors armed with a radical Manifesto, has inspired, outraged and provoked filmmakers and filmgoers the world over. The rules of Dogme95 take filmmaking back to its brass-tacks - stories must be set in the here and now; the films must be shot on location, with a handheld camera, using natural light, and direct sound; the rules forbid murders and weapons (staples of the much-loved action-movie genre); and, most amusingly, the director must not be credited (that holds also for the director of The Name of this Film is Dogme95...).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ef8S5y5acfOVPqfQ3DOQMdomASP.jpg", "actors": ["Lars von Trier (Himself)", "Thomas Vinterberg (Himself)", "Jean-Marc Barr (Himself)", "Ewen Bremner (Himself)", "Anthony Dod Mantle (Himself)", "Harmony Korine (Himself)", "S\u00f8ren Kragh-Jacobsen (Himself)", "Kristian Levring (Himself)", "Paprika Steen (Herself)", "Richard Kelly (Himself - Host)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
