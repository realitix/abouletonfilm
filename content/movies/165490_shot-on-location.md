Sexploitation vets RENE BOND, RIC LUTZ, EVE ORLON, and SANDY DEMPSEY are on hand to convince you otherwise.  But don\u2019t make up your mind before considering the boners offered up here in the spirit of poetic licentiousness, as the story of a randy group of moviemakers plays itself out with characteristic early-Seventies panache. Suffice it to say that \"shooting on location,\" in more ways than one, is the order of business in this excessively un-metaphysical epic.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Rene Bond ()", "Sandy Dempsey ()", "Suzanne Fields ()", "Ric Lutze ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
