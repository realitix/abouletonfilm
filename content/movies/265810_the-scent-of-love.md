Kim Min-kyu climbs telephone poles scattered in the dismal neighborhood. Recently released from prison, he works as an electrician under the watchful eye of his probation officer. His only joy is carving the Namsan Tower out of soap bars, on those poles. He notices one day that there is an intruder in his private world. Someone has started posting missing person leaflets. Min-kyu begins to remove them one by one. But to his consternation, the stranger keeps replacing the ones he has removed. Da-hae's only goal in life is to find her missing brother. She lives hand-to-mouth but that is the least of her problems. She is also slowly losing her sight. Min-kyu and Da-hae find themselves drawn to one another by their pain and loneliness to somehow find a way to heal each other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gRlZLQo3zTBoQBCktzuG4Uqrshw.jpg", "actors": ["Park Jung-chul (Kim Min-kyu)", "Choi Yu-Jeong (Jang Da-hye)", "Bang Eun-jin ()", "Jin-su Ahn ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
