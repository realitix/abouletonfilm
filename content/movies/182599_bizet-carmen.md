The opera spurred mixed emotions amongst critics and casual operagoers. As a result, numerous planned performances were canceled. Bizet died on June 3, 1875 firmly believing that Carmen was a failure. Since the early 1880s, however, Carmen has been one of the most frequently performed operas in venues around the world.
