While Marcela is there, Jarda is jailed, because he is part of a gang steeling cars and they get caught in the act. Benes, the urbane man whose car got stolen by Jarda and his gang, befriends Marcela. Soon she feels drawn to Benes and all of a sudden she must make up her mind: Jarda is still sexually attractive to her, but Benes offers security, and her own body and mind may not pull at the same strand.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1ihoiykPMxrRmnsPjJjbQTcrFAb.jpg", "actors": ["Anna Geislerov\u00e1 ()", "Jana Brejchov\u00e1 ()", "Ji\u0159\u00ed Schmitzer ()", "Em\u00edlia V\u00e1\u0161\u00e1ryov\u00e1 ()", "Josef Abrh\u00e1m ()", "Roman Lukn\u00e1r ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [146361], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
