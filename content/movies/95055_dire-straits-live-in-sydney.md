Promoting their hit album Brothers in Arms, the tour included a thirteen-night residence at Wembley Arena (featuring Eric Clapton helping out) and a brief jaunt at Live Aid (featuring Sting), before winding up in Australia in the Spring of 86. They ended with a 21-night stand at Sydney's Entertainment Center, packing the place every night, and wrapping it all up with one final show on April 26th. Featuring the one-off calypso version of \"So Far Away\" and an impromtu version of the Australian folk anthem \"Walktzing Matilda\" (with the whole stadium providing the vocals), it is truly a show for the ages.  This show represents a band at their very finest, a band that has perfected the art of transitioning from structured verse/chorus parts to solos and back, bringing the audience along on an emotional and gorgeous journey for each and every song.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h4dVBk4ZIksIPQy8G9HLj0JAjhL.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Knopfler (Guitar, Vocals)", "John Illsley (Bass, Vocals)", "Jack Sonni (Guitar, Vocals)", "Alan Clark (Keyboards)", "Guy Fletcher (Keyboards, Vocals)", "Chris White (Sax, Flute, Drums)", "Terry Williams (Drums)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
