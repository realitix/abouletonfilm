Vilnius Trolleybus Park is sold to a young investor,  who wants to change trolleybuses to more convenient high-tech, wireless, pilotless vehicles. Needless to say, that this high-tech wonder will require very little maintenance, so the drivers and supporting staff will be fired. But it is way more than that. Without the old trolleybuses the city is never going to be the same.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1WCs8arnNFLONvsosIRRVDEZQfw.jpg", "actors": ["Liubomiras Laucevicius ()", "Karina Stungyt\u0117 ()", "Gabija Siurbyt\u0117 ()", "Vytautas Kup\u0161ys ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
