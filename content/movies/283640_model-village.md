From South Korea it can only just be seen and looks like a film set. The brightly painted concrete flats are empty shells, the flagpole is one of the tallest in the world and the loudspeakers blast nationalist slogans and songs. Model Village envisages a visit to this forbidden zone.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o32uuO5gxjAdxNQB7jgT3GkDnHK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
