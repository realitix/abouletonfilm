She composes a series of audio letters to him, begins saving money for a plane ticket to Los Angeles in hopes of visiting him, and has imaginary conversations with Depp (in his various film roles). Meanwhile, the talk among Fili's friends is of boys and sex. When Fili discovers that Johnny is only interested in girls with some experience, she is in a hurry to lose her virginity -- but with whom? Trying to find the right guy for her initiation turns out to be a bit more complicated than Fili imagined; the fellow she picks is twentysomething Ike who already has a girlfriend and isn't too interested in Fili.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Lavinia Wilson (Fili)", "Benno F\u00fcrmann (Ike)", "Hannes Jaenicke (George)", "Eva Ha\u00dfmann (Nina)", "Andreas Herder (Johnny Depp)", "Oriana Schrage (Becky)", "Anne Kasprik (Helga)", "Emma Hipp (Millie)", "Camilla Schmid (Sandra)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
