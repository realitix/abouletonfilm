On the eighth floor of a new Dutch apartment block, 12-year-old Duch lives with his family. His hobbies are space travel and Mary, the pretty woman next door. Duch\u2019s father prefers to watch the neighbour who recently moved in two doors down. Her arrival makes the residents aware of the free-sex morality. Up until now it had left the eighth floor untouched, but that is clearly not to everyone\u2019s satisfaction.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dsxvxIMaPU7lZBq1s4RfEVqqJcp.jpg", "actors": ["Marcel Hensema (Bob)", "Elise Schaap (Mary)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
