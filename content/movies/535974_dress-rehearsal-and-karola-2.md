Her way of dealing with clothes and jewelry, her specific talent of using whatever she wears or touches as a means of self-expression, informs the images of both works. But although DRESS REHEARSAL and KAROLA 2 were edited out of the same material, even using identical footage now and then, they differ considerably in structure and pace. This is achieved by the different functions of music in both works, and also by color movement, grouping of images and patterns of duration and repetition.\" (Christine Noll Brinckmann)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/goMEGeEKJaJjiE3qd79P2TWzuQ3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
