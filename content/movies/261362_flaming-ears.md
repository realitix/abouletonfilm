It follows the tangled lives of three women -- Volley, Nun and Spy. Spy is a comic book artist whose printing presses are burned down by Volley, a sexed-up pyromaniac. Seeking revenge, Spy goes to the lesbian club where Volley performs every night. Before she can enter, Spy gets into a fight and is left wounded, lying in the streets. She is found by Nun--an amoral alien in a red plastic suit with a predilection for reptiles, and who also happens to be Volley\u2019s lover. Nun takes her home and subsequently must hide her from Volley. It\u2019s a story of love and revenge, and an anti-romantic plea for love in its many forms.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dKW4iosxHsmCbeZIGoYK9DDm2qG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
