They disguise themselves as Shocker soldiers and infiltrate the main headquarters, but it doesn't take too long for Ambassador Hell to find their whereabouts and trap them. Before he detonates a bomb within the base, Ambassador Hell tells Kamen Rider 1 and Taki that Shocker is preparing a giant laser capable of destroying cities. Our two heroes must escape from the base's self-destruction and stop Shocker from arming their latest weapon. Not only that, they must rescue Tachibana and the racing club, who have been abducted by Shocker's minions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dKWLP6Mbqkf8U3QN505AW2w9FD4.jpg", "actors": ["Hiroshi Fujioka (Takeshi Hongo / Kamen Rider 1)", "Jir\u00f4 Chiba (FBI Agent Kazuya Taki)", "Akiji Kobayashi (T\u014dbei Tachibana)", "Kenji Ushio (Hell's Ambassador)", "Gor\u014d Naya (The Great Boss (voice))", "Tadao Futami (Kamikiri Kid (voice))", "Mahito Tsujimura (Zanjiou (voice))", "Shinji Nakae (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "EP-xdEsUa6k"}
