One respite to Raouf's dreary life is a recent film assignment -- to shoot an autobiographical film about his childhood. While working on the script, Raouf recalls his childhood home life under the strictures instituted by his devoutly religious father. The polar opposite of Raouf's father was his uncle Mansour, a jolly, life-loving soul who introduced Raouf to cinema through his work as a wandering film projectionist, which angered and shocked his father to no end but proved to be the most pivotal development in the youngster's life. Through cinema, Raouf found his place in this world and came-of-age -- something he may have to revisit in his adult life if he wishes to salvage his marriage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7CTelCxXtwguv6c01BnWcnLoTiP.jpg", "actors": ["Marianne Basler (Lou)", "Abdellatif Kechiche (Raouf as Adult)", "Hichem Rostom (Mansour)", "Lotfi Bouchnak (Father)", "Medhi Rebii (Raouf as Child)", "Myrna Maakaron (Daughter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
