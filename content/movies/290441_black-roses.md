The Czar\u2019s soldiers have been close on the heels of the leader of the rebellious Finns, who have been fighting the Russian occupiers since the end of the 18th Century.  His flight leads him to the chambers of the dancer Marina Feodorowna, in whose house a party is taking place at that very moment.  Marina discovers the intruder, hides him from his pursuers and soon falls in love with him.  But hiding Erkki forever is not an option; so she presents him as her music teacher.  The swindle fails and Prince Governor Abarow, who\u2019s long had a thing for Marina, discovers the real identity of the man, but doesn\u2019t have him arrested.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xecMK81QGI6kXLh4aMYvqL2Gy0g.jpg", "actors": ["Lilian Harvey (Tania Fedorovna)", "Willy Fritsch (Erkki Collin)", "Willy Birgel (F\u00fcrst Abarow)", "Gerhard Bienert (Niklander)", "Wolf Ackva ()", "Klaus Pohl (Polizeiagent)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
