It's poorly edited, poorly written and just poorly constructed. There may be those who would argue that the intentions of the makers was met, but we are not talking a case of so bad its fun territory here. It's painful, period.\r\n\r\nA number of screwy inconsequential scenes are stitched together in the hope of entertaining somebody, with a musical score fresh out of nursery school for accompaniment. The odd scene briefly raises a modicum of interest, as our two lead protagonists screwball their way to retrieving finances they lost, but come the end, if you have managed to stay that far, you may want to set fire to your TV set. 1/10"}], "recommandations_id": []}
