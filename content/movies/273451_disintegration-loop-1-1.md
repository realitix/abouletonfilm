Shot from Basinski's roof in Williamsburg Brooklyn, this is an actual documentary of how he and his neighbors witnessed the end of that fateful day. It is a tragically beautiful cinema verite elegy dedicated to those who perished in the atrocities of September 11th, 2001.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iK3kYceib1GOAbk0gw7ZEvCue1Z.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
