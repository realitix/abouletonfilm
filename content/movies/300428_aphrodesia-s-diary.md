From that day forward, she kept her most intimate thoughts and salacious experience in a locked diary. Now after many years and many lovers, she's opening that diary just for you! A real movie-movie that emphasizes the performances, both in bed and out. It has a deliberate pace, plot twists, and genuine heart. More romantic than nut-busting, it is a film which women will find especially satisfying, as Adrienne is transformed from sexually naive to cynically carnal.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/11N6CBr0NtvQi9zKuKPYpzJgwbN.jpg", "actors": ["Dominique Saint Claire (Adrianne)", "Daniel Clair (Alain)", "Patricia Bouvier (Porn actress in Paris (uncredited))", "Andr\u00e9 Kay ()", "Kevin James (Jeff)", "Ron Jeremy ((uncredited))", "Lisa Cintrice ()", "Joanna Storm (Mrs. Triad)", "Alan Adrian (Mr. Triad)", "Alan Adrian (Cassandra - The Erotic Spirit)", "Morgane (Alice)", "Vanessa del Rio (Therapist)", "George Payne ((uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
