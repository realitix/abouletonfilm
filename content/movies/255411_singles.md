I particularly see it as some sort of throwback to the surreal cartoons from the early nineties (The Ren & Stimpy Show and the first Rugrats episodes)\r\n\r\nIt is mostly an exercise of style over substance, with the visual elements being more important than the narrative, but I honestly think that the final result is good enough to be worth-watching. The design of the main character reminded me a little the works of John Kricfalusi.\r\n\r\nI think that anyone who enjoys surreal and strange animations will find this to be interesting."}], "recommandations_id": []}
