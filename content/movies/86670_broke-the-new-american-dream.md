Michael Covel traveled 75,000 miles over the course of 2007 and 2008 to visit with hundreds of people from America to Europe to Asia from London to Tokyo to Macau to Singapore to New York City - Covel went everywhere. He interviews single moms facing foreclosure, Nobel Prize winners, professional poker players and US Congressmen. How did we dig such a big hole when it comes to our retirement, money and investments? We all want to retire, we all want to provide for our families, but Covel's film paints a picture that trusting the government, TV shows, big brokerage firms and mutual funds is not the way to go. There are ways for all of us to break away from the fear and confusion so many of us feel about our money, but the world has changed and it is time for straight talk.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7MR4pbilpKfEhx75gRQASyLtzeo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "UPWXnlILRrg"}
