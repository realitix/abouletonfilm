This was the starting point for Lukka, for, unlike Mustafa, who didn't deal in ammunition, fire-arms, and drugs, there was no limit. And soon Lukka had his own followers, who eventually other-threw Mustafa, making him the uncrowned king of the underworld. People who were foolish enough to oppose Lukka were easily disposed off. For instance, Mustafa had his arms cut off; Tandya was shot dead; Police Inspector Shankar was dismissed from service, and imprisoned; Air Force Pilot Arjun was dishonorably discharged and then court-martial-ed. Now there is no one left to oppose Lukka and his followers, who are all set to do what they like - no limits whatsoever.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cpmJeHsjF9rZ80tjj0NwBXYuCYP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
