Aided by rancher Frank Farrell and his sister Juanita \"Nita\" Hodges, Gentry consistently foils \"The Recorders\" schemes, which are carried out by \"The Recorder's\" henchmen, Krendon, Allen and Chandler, including an attack on the Panama Canal.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Tom Neal ()", "Judy Clark ()", "Ralph Hodges ()", "Forrest Taylor ()", "Hugh Prosser ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
