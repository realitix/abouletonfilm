One of the bestselling albums of all time, RUMOURS' impeccable songwriting, lush vocal harmonies, and polished production stand as testament to the band's cohesive powers--a fact made even more remarkable by the romantic tensions roiling amongst its members at the time (Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks were ending their long-term romantic relationship; Christine and John McVie were getting a divorce). This episode of the CLASSIC ALBUMS series recounts the making of Fleetwood Mac's career-making opus through interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, and live performances of timeless gems such as \"Don't Stop,\" \"Dreams,\"\"Go Your Own Way,\" \"You Make Loving Fun,\" \"The Chain,\" and more.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eul4vORAAt2YK88GhJlcA9oWElw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
