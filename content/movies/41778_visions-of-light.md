Themes: the DP tells people where to look; changes in movies (the arrival of sound, color, and wide screens) required creative responses from DPs; and, these artisans constantly invent new equipment and try new things, with wonderful results. The narration takes us through the identifiable studio styles of the 30s, the emergence of noir, the New York look, and the impact of Europeans. Citizen Kane, The Conformist, and Gordon Willis get special attention.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xc5xQXJGTcpyiiMP5gDduVcdhKN.jpg", "actors": ["Vilmos Zsigmond ()", "Sven Nykvist ()", "N\u00e9stor Almendros ()", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs ()", "Vittorio Storaro ()", "Haskell Wexler ()", "Gordon Willis ()", "Michael Ballhaus ()", "Sandi Sissel ()", "Robert Wise ()", "Charles Lang ()", "John Bailey ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [51182, 33823, 30856, 84643], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
