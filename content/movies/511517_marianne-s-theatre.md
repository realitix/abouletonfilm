The ringmaster waves her baton at three shadowy acrobats that climb one by one out of her hat. Each performs his number, although not without some difficulty. The clumsiness of the first, the mischievousness of the second, and the fieriness of the third trigger a few clashes that ultimately lead to chaos. How can Marianne create harmony without losing control? Will her show flop? Who's really calling the shots, the little puppet or her acrobats?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qP3PS1djKiXznAlYWviCEfsRc9W.jpg", "actors": ["Sylvie Chartrand (Puppeteer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
