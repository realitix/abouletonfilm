The camera, circling around or brushing close to constructed sets, props, faces, and bodies, caresses these material elements, intimately describes their sculptural surfaces, and yet, paradoxically, when these images are projected as a beam of light, they become transparent, their heft subtracted. I want to play at seducing the viewer while allowing escape routes from the game. My implementation of certain ideals \u2013 primary colors, mechanical or athletic bodies, geometric sets, smooth skinned faces \u2013 is always tempered by the presence of something a little more awkward: shadows, seams, aging, exhaustion.\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rlJLVSpJnFOhitkUKm8ZfyIwF7O.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
