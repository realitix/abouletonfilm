In fact, despite a title card that reads, \"Tex Ritter and Dave O'Brien as the Texas Rangers,\" Ritter actually works on Lorraine Miller's ranch. Peggy Barlou (Miller) is the young rancher who refuses to sell her spread to greedy stage-line proprietor John Rankin (Edward Howard). Tex Haines (Ritter), meanwhile, is accused of killing Bill Dugan (Art Fowler), Rankin's bodyguard, but eludes capture long enough to hook up with Dave Wyatt (O'Brien) and Panhandle Perkins (Guy Wilkerson), a couple of rangers in disguise.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aSMJn303hORbtX2Fmbd3LlyAzvN.jpg", "actors": ["Tex Ritter (Tex Haines)", "Dave O'Brien (Dave Wyatt)", "Guy Wilkerson (Panhandle Perkins)", "Lorraine Miller (Peggy Barlow)", "Charles King (Bart Rawlings (as Charles King Jr.))", "Edward Howard (John Rankin)", "Ed Cassidy (Jim Manning (as Edward Cassidy))", "Bud Osborne (Sheriff Backley)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
