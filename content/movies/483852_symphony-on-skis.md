He conquered the major glaciers of the Southern Alps and crossed 40km and 4000 vertical meters, from the heart of the South Island to the Pacific in just 18 hours. A route of astonishing beauty, immense freedom, breathtaking vistas and the danger of the uncontainable nature. He called this route \u201cSymphony on Skis\u201d.  Now, his daughters Carla, Elke and a small team of adventurers embark on the same adventure. This film is a homage to their late father who found a love and home in New Zealand's Southern Alps.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qvhlhfrjJZE0K9XOwAjvirBdcRk.jpg", "actors": ["Carla Braun-Elwert (Self)", "Elke Braun-Elwert (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
