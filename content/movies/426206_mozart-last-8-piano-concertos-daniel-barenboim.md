The music of Mozart has quite literally been an essential driving force of Daniel Barenboim\u2019s entire life. It remains central to his performing career both as a pianist and as a conductor.  These illuminating performances of Mozart\u2019s last eight great piano concertos admirably demonstrate Barenboim\u2019s dictum that even when a true musician has already performed a familiar work hundreds of times, he or she \u2018never accepts that the next note will be played the same way as it was played before.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wnqHyqGty8obERfpvVEKe9K9hnc.jpg", "actors": ["Daniel Barenboim (Pianist/Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
