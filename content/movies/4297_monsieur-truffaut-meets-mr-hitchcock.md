Not only in France but all over the world, Truffaut's Hitchcock interview developed over the years into a standard bible of film literature. In 1983, three years after Hitchcock's death, Truffaut decided to expand his by now legendary book to include a concluding chapter and have it published as the \"Edition d\u00e9finitive\". This film describes the genesis of the \"Hitchbook\" and throws light on the strange friendship between two completely different men. The centrepieces are the extracts from the original sound recordings of the interview with the voices of Alfred Hitchcock, Francois Truffaut, and Helen Scott \u2013 recordings which have never been heard in public before.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8x8fcQYqndGFH32OVWsxkb1YUqV.jpg", "actors": ["Claude Chabrol (Himself)", "Patricia Hitchcock (Herself)", "Madeleine Morgenstern (Herself)", "Jean-Louis Richard (Himself)", "Laura Truffaut (Herself)", "Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut (Himself (archive footage))", "Alfred Hitchcock (Himself (archive footage))", "Helen Scott (Herself (archive footage))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
