No Logo is the warning on the label.  In the last decade, No Logo has become a cultural manifesto for the critics of unfettered capitalism worldwide. As the world faces a second economic depression, No Logo's analysis of our corporate and branded world is as timely and powerful as ever.  Equal parts cultural analysis, political manifesto, mall-rat memoir, and journalistic expos\u00e9, No Logo is the first book to put the new resistance into pop-historical and clear economic perspective. It tells a story of rebellion and self-determination in the face of our new branded world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lh7Zy2pcAf56wRIQiGq523zPqJr.jpg", "actors": ["Naomi Klein (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
