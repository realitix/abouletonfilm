Dalisay struggles to journey from the Philippine countryside to New York City to marry Dean, a disillusioned ex-merchant marine. She's hoping to buy a cure for her dying sister and, ultimately, a future for her debt-ridden family, while he hopes to escape his disintegrating American family through love and a family of his own. A powerful, controversial film that quietly builds to a shattering collision of aspirations and cultures.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p9ITtOd9iG6Wnlv6JuDMPTHsyur.jpg", "actors": ["Woody A.
