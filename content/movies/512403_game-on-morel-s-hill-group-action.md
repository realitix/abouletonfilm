Przemys\u0142aw Kwiek suggested continuing the debate the following day through a conversation of \u201cvisual tactics\u201d between two teams who each had 1.5m long sticks as well as white and red canvas. Each team watched as the other made a move, and fourteen were made in total over three hours. Documented through photographs and text, Kweik and Kulik presented this material as a narrated slideshow in the 1970s-80s, and in 2006 recreated this in the form of a digital video.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7LtEZOJismFLuVvaKGlcu6XBd13.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
