She took the rap of being a class traitor because she was in love with the boy who had betrayed his classmates when they were bunking off and going to cinema instead of a literature lesson. The class is penalized for that, not being allowed to go to Moscow for fall holidays with the rest of the school. Lena is being ostracized, \"boycotted\" however not telling the truth, waiting that the boy himself would confess to be guilty.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bFTaX5RGOY0K4yC2o3bNENnCEv2.jpg", "actors": ["Kristina Orbakayte (Lena Bessoltseva)", "Yuriy Nikulin (Nicolay Bessoltsev, Lena's grandfather)", "Yelena Sanayeva (\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430)", "Svetlana Kryuchkova (\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043c\u0430\u0445\u0435\u0440)", "Rolan Bykov (\u0434\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0436\u0435\u0440 \u043e\u0440\u043a\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [65713, 83437, 70965, 84821], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
