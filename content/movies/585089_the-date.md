Their initial encounter ends well, when Mike \u201cgets the number\u201d. As time goes by the relationship blossoms and they make a tradition of always coming back to the same place they met every year for their anniversary. Year by year, at the same burger joint, we see them evolve, from doting on each other, to supporting, to tolerating and eventually to bickering and fighting. Will the maturity that time brings to every couple be enough to save their relationship? Or will they both end up heart broken like so many other twenty something\u2019s trying to get a handle on the delicate balance between love and life?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
