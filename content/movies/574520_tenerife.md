At 2:00 in the afternoon, a thick fog rolled into the usually quiet Los Rodeos Airport in Tenerife, in the Canary Islands. On the runway sat two fully loaded jumbo airliners. An explosion at a nearby airport had redirected air traffic to the undermanned airfield at Tenerife. Within three hours 583 people would be dead. This film reconstructs the moments leading up to the tragedy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tFR8Xs8NL9AALpgOHFWWMzib0fX.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Bandey (Bragg)", "Anne Cart (KLM Purser)", "Lee Delong (Erma Schlecht)", "Mike Dineen (Pan Am Flight Engineer George Warns)", "James Gerard (Walter)", "Lexie Kendrick (Robina Van Lanschot)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
