After some savage heavy petting they meet a sinister fakir who offers to sell them Truth for six sous. A set of uncanny events follow. At worst 'avant-gardist' in the extreme, at best the counterpart to C\u0153ur Fid\u00e8le's 'f\u00eate foraine' sequence after the abolition of melodrama. Excellent black screen cutting and chaotic camera shaking characterize the style.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/heuckTqbpi7gkAl4AfUagEJa65Z.jpg", "actors": ["Hubert Daix ()", "Valentine Gragowska ()", "Josette Perdriat ()", "Fran\u00e7ois Viguier ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
