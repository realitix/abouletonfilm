During this period, Ruhmann falls in love and gains a whole new lease on life. Frantically, he seeks out the man whom he has hired to bump him off -- only to find out that the latter has sold his \"contract\" to another fellow -- who in turn has sold it to a third party. Eventually, the whole mess is wrapped up with a Keystone-like car chase. Famed composer Friedrich Hollander shows up in a minor role, complete with patently phony mustache. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x7ginnCHD0Fwaoq4I23cJ7H0tYc.jpg", "actors": ["Heinz R\u00fchmann (Hans Herfort)", "Lien Deyers (Kitty)", "Raimund Janitschek (Otto Kuttlapp)", "Hans Leibelt (Adamowski)", "Friedrich Hollaender (Vorsitzender der \u201eWei\u00dfen Weste\u201c)", "Gerhard Bienert (Schupo)", "Hermann Speelmans (Jim)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "2947qad_OoA"}
