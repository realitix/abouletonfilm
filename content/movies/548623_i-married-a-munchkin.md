Self-described as \"normal, but little,\" Mary Ellen details her early start in show business as a performer in an all-dwarf vaudeville act, her brief appearance in 1946's THREE WISE FOOLS, her 1948 marriage to former Munchkin Parnell St. Aubin and their subsequent retirement from entertainment to run a bar (called the Midget Club) in the South Side of Chicago. Two other former Munchkins (Margaret Pellegrini and Clarence Swensen) briefly appear among the day's revelry. Also included is a postscript (shot some time after the initial film) featuring Mary Ellen briefly describing the original size of her role in THREE WISE FOOLS, which originally featured a line and an ill-fated \"flying\" effect. - Tom Fritsche", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p2ewGL24VcQq0c6us2lukJAusCy.jpg", "actors": ["Carla Beesbor (Dorothy Braid Contest Winner)", "Amy Garvey (Dorothy Braid Contest Winner)", "Tom Palazzolo (Himself)", "Margaret Pellegrini (Sleepyhead)", "Mary Ellen St. Aubin (Herself)", "Patty Swenson (Herself)", "Elizabeth Barrington (Herself)", "Karl 'Karchy' Kosiczky (Himself)", "Ozma Baum Mantele (Ozma)", "Jerry Maren (Himself)", "Nels P.
