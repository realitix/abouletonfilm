This ultimate prize is named for 9/11 hero, Mark Bingham, a passionate gay rugger and a passenger on Flight 93 who courageously stormed the cockpit and prevented the hijackers from turning their flight into a terrorist weapon. Character driven, emotionally charged and socially compelling; Walk Like A Man is a real life drama about real life issues punctuated with blood, sweat and queers!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cdnqr6msUfn2zIBCII18cHLhLE5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
