But it can be so much more, even sinister, as in Sunset Boulevard. In Leyenda dorada a rather unglamorous swimming pool of diminished charm forms the focal point of the story. A lazy summer\u2019s day in the Spanish village of Mont\u00e1nchez, and people of all ages enjoy themselves at the outdoor pool. It is an almost utopian depiction of community, under the lofty, watchful gaze of Our Lady of Consolation. While conflicts, aggression, rivalries and animosities have a siesta, the villagers take a well-deserved break. Formally, the film draws on the tradition of New Objectivity. But unlike Robert Siodmak\u2019s Menschen am Sonntag (1930) and its lido sequence, this is a wee summer fairy tale.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xuLgCpnVts1v5iNxDsyhFyxZix2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
