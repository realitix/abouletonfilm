While being followed by nebbish journalist Bob (Michael Chow Man-kin) and coping with their own personal issues, the three are being targeted by Andy, a crazed arms-dealer who is seeking vengeance on Charlie for the death of his wife following a particularly ugly FBI raid years previous. Since Charlie's a hard man to find, the villain takes his wrath out on his friends and employees -- especially his three angels.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Paulyn Sun ()", "Christine Ng ()", "Jade Leung ()", "Lam Lap-San ()", "Michael Chow Man-Kin ()", "Yeung Hoi-See ()", "Ching Fung ()", "Lam Wai ()", "File Yip Gwok-Wing ()", "Kenny Wong Tak-Ban ()", "Mau Kin-Tak ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
