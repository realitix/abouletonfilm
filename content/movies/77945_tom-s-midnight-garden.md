Because he may be infectious he is not allowed out to play, and feels lonely. Without exercise he is less sleepy at night and when he hears the communal grandfather clock strangely strike 13, he investigates and finds the small back yard is now a large sunlit garden. Here he meets another lonely child called Hatty, who seems to be the only one who can see him. They have adventures which he gradually realises are taking place in the 19th century. And each night when Tom visits, Hatty is a different age, chronologically out of sequence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9flBPLbXqiU6VyDsYUvF9Lp4c4H.jpg", "actors": ["Nigel Le Vaillant (Thomas Long (Adult))", "Marlene Sidaway (Doris Schuster)", "Serena Gordon (Melody Long)", "Greta Scacchi (Aunt Gwen Kitson)", "James Wilby (Uncle Alan Kitson)", "Anthony Way (Tom Long)", "Alfie Lawrence (Harriet Long)", "Mel Martin (Alice Long)", "Nick Robinson (Peter Long)", "Liz Smith (Mrs Willows)", "Arlene Cockburn (Susan the Maid)", "Tom Bowles (Mr Ferguson)", "Joan Plowright (Mrs Bartholomew)", "David Bradley (Abel)", "Stuart Piper (Hubert)", "Rory Jennings (James (12 years))", "Florence Hoath (Hatty (12 years))", "Penelope Wilton (Aunt Melbourne)", "Laurel Melsom (Youngest Hatty)", "Noah Huntley (James (20 years))", "Caroline Carver (Hatty (Young Woman))", "Daniel Betts (Barty)", "Robert Putt (Tower Keeper)", "Arthur Cox (Mr Batsford)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [101279, 228187, 104153, 87417], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
