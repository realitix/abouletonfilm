Struggling to reconcile the evidence with his once held religious views, Peter turns to his uncle, Josh Sanders, a retired scientist and a man of strong Christian faith. Meanwhile, Sarah Pennington seeks protection for her young daughter, Kara, believing the extraterrestrials are bent on abducting the gifted nine-year-old as they did Sarah's husband three years earlier. When the four are brought together by Ethan, a mysterious stranger, Peter and Sarah wrestle with their own beliefs as Josh seeks to convince them of the truth. It becomes clear that Kara has a very special gift-one that can expose the true nature of the extraterrestrials.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pWVJJxGTG3fyowJzPb3vIc99f4A.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
