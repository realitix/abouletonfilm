Mayweather is coming off that controversial victory over Victor Ortiz last September. That was the first time he stepped in the ring in 16 months due to various issues, but he looked like the \"Money\" of old before the ending tainted his performance.  Cotto might not be the opponent everyone wanted for Mayweather, but he is certainly capable of holding his own against the undefeated challenger. He has looked impressive in winning his last three fights via TKO following a loss to Manny Pacquiao", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vtkEJdN9JVVU1kb3gsCAz38UFXA.jpg", "actors": ["Floyd Mayweather Jr. (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
