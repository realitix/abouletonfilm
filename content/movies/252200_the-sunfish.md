Life trudges along without surprises, but all this is about to change. The fishing industry is hit by financial crisis and the small fishing boats are swiftly put out of competition by big corporations. In desperation, Kesse tries to find a way out of his hopeless plight and has to resort to dishonest means, on top of having to fire his best friend and lone employee. As if this wasn't enough, he gets an unwelcome guest on-board in the form of marine biologist Gerd from Copenhagen, sent to study the fishing. S\u00f8ren Balle's debut feature is a funny and touching film about love, friendship and the difficult art of dealing with change.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2Kq8IASNhGFCdHrsgPKsnmi1pWT.jpg", "actors": ["Henrik Birch (Kesse)", "Susanne Storm (Gerd)", "Lars Torpp Thomsen (Lille Lars)", "Mikkel Vadsholt (Sorte)", "Kresten Andersen (Henning)", "Mikkel Vadsholt ()", "Lone R\u00f8dbroe ()", "Allan Helge Jensen ()", "Hanne Laursen ()", "Jytte Kvinesdal ()", "Ole S\u00f8rensen ()", "Michael Derlev Harbo ()", "Lars Ditlev Johansen ()", "Martin Ringsmose ()", "Bjarne Eilers ()", "J\u00f8rgen Bing ()", "Alf Gundersen ()", "Per Kristensen ()", "Kjeld \"Jolle\" Kristensen ()", "Normann Jensen ()", "Lotte Storgaard ()", "John \"Gumbas\" Jensen ()", "Katrine Stein ()", "Melissa Pedersen ()", "Tine Ketilsson ()", "Keld Hahn ()", "Jacob Ulrik Lohmann (Carsten)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [104733, 155714, 322664], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
