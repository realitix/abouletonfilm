Franz Hinkelammert, a German-born liberation theologian, economist and philosopher, brings religion front and center to the discussion in a unique way. The emptiness and senselessness felt by those at the margins of a free-market Utopian ideology has been filled by an extreme millenarian Christianity and other fundamentalist religions that justify murder and torture as preemptive self-defense. In place of a suicidal theology of death based on defeating or marginalizing others, Hinkelammert advocates an economics that promotes coexistence by looking towards liberation theology and the preferential option for the poor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/krE4dPG1dKSD0QAjsO3jZK3gpob.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
