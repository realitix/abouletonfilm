He reveals the story of the pursuit of AI, the emergence of machine learning and the recent breakthroughs brought about by artificial neural networks. He shows how AI is not only changing our world but also challenging our very ideas of intelligence and consciousness.  Along the way, we'll investigate spam filters, meet a cutting-edge chatbot, look at why a few altered pixels makes a computer think it's looking at a trombone rather than a dog and talk to Demis Hassabis, who heads DeepMind and whose stated mission is to 'solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else'. Stephen Hawking remarked 'AI could be the biggest event in the history of our civilisation. Or the worst'.  Jim argues that AI is a potent new tool that should enhance our lives, not replace us.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cnJokOmYMaXXlrgN5Zh0NvH9lnO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
