Even more significantly it heralds the emergence of the feature film format.  The Story of the Kelly Gang, directed by Charles Tait in 1906, is the first full-length narrative feature film produced anywhere in the world.  Only fragments of the original production of more than one hour are known to exist and are preserved at the National Film and Sound Archive, Canberra.
