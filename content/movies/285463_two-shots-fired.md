Then he gets out and mows the lawn, where he accidentally cuts the mower\u2019s power cord when he runs over it. Set on fixing it, he goes to find tools but stumbles across a gun that he brings back to his room to shoot himself twice. But Mariano survives: one bullet just grazed his head and the other one, he believes, is stuck somewhere inside his body even if the doctors can\u2019t find it anywhere, nor any exit wound for that matter. The only aftereffect he seems to have is a mysterious double-note when he plays music with his friends, which according to him is probably the result of the bullet still being inside him. But Mariano\u2019s impulsive act will have other consequences on the people surrounding him\u2026", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lhhpYD8iJiSoFgvlgIK9Fnm5eaD.jpg", "actors": ["Susana Pamp\u00edn (Susana)", "Rafael Federman (Mariano)", "Laura Paredes (Margarita)", "Mariel Fernand\u00e9z ()", "Benjamin Coelho (Ezequiel)", "Manuela Martelli (Luc\u00eda)", "Camila Fabbri (Ana (as Camila Fabri))", "Daniela Pal (Liliana)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
