Compared to the likes of David Lynch, Larry Clark, Harmony Korine and John Cassavetes, the film dares the audience to watch it, confronting issues with kids and teenagers often sugar-coated by Hollywood. The movie tackles hard-hitting subjects like self mutilation by teen girls, bullying, rape, bulimia (showcasing the actual damage it does to a girl's body) and, of course, the murder.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/848zL3hVeXeSCl5SXFi4crEUK09.jpg", "actors": ["Katie Marsh (Alyssa)", "Demi Baumann (Sidekick)", "Teona Dolnikova (Performer)", "Alexis Damianos (Angst)", "Kaliya Skye (Elizabeth)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "a1GyyoiXVew"}
