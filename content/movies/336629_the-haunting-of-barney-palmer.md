Young Barney fears that he has inherited the Scholar family curse; a suite of 80s-era effects ramp up the supernatural suspense. The film was a co-production between PBS (United States) and Wellington's Gibson Group, which resulted in Ned Beatty (Deliverance, Network) being cast. It was written by Margaret Mahy, based on her Carnegie Award-winning novel The Haunting, and an early fruitful collaboration between her and director Yvonne Mackay.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nbnYbCia5xyc3JbporYXrL6aPu9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
