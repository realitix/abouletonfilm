As he begins preparing the Cafe, he turns to and regards the camera as a would-be customer, saying that they aren't open yet and to watch a summary of what's happened so far while waiting. This special, also referred to as episode 46.5, serves as a summary of the previous few battles against the Gurongi as they get stronger and stronger, as well as a build-up to the last three episodes and Kuuga's battle with Daguva. It is a clip show of past episodes (specifically 32-46) which features very little new footage, most of which is revealed to simply be a dream.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/do6g4SkboYKK2uelrRnfuvwj0C3.jpg", "actors": ["Joe Odagiri (Yusuke Godai / Kamen Rider Kuuga)", "Shingo Katsurayama (Kaoru Ichijo)", "Kazumi Murata (Sakurako Sawatari)", "Wakana Aoi (Minori Godai)", "Yoshitaka \u00d4tsuka (Shuichi Tsubaki)", "Mitsuru Fujio (Gooma (human form))", "Masayoshi Okawa (Jaraji (human form))", "Nobuyuki Ogawa (Badaa (human form))", "Mie Nanamori (Baruba (human form))", "Sumire Arai (Jaaza (human form))", "Kensho Sakurai (Baberu (human form))", "Masato Gunji (Gadoru (human form))", "Kenji Urai (Daguva (human form))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "OeXbbcg7YCw"}
