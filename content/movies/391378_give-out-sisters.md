They play the lead act at a popular nightclub. The trouble begins when they hire a few students from a financially foundering dance school for their newest production. One of the dancers, a rich young socialite, desperately wants to be in it too, but her prurient maiden aunts refuse to allow her to disgrace their family by becoming a common chorine. She and the club owner (who must have the aunt's permission because the girl is underage) try to convince them, but it's not easy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uvLLU7aG3wPrMDatdWgLWZXiEAi.jpg", "actors": ["Laverne Andrews (Laverne Andrews)", "Patty Andrews (Patty)", "Maxene Andrews (Maxene Andrews)", "Grace McDonald (Gracie Waverly)", "Dan Dailey (Bob Edwards (as Dan Dailey Jr.))", "Charles Butterworth (Prof. Woof)", "Walter Catlett (Gribble)", "William Frawley (Harrison)", "Donald O'Connor (Don)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
