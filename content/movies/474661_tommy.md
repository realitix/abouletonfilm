He was one of the best heavyweights of his time; a handsome, charming, yet unsettled young star. Born into a troubled family in America\u2019s heartland, Morrison\u2019s initial emergence as a fighter was bolstered by a starring role in \u201cRocky V.\u201d  A few years later he beat George Foreman for the WBO heavyweight title, and seemed primed for more stardom, even in the face of blown opportunities and upset losses. But everything changed in early 1996 when he tested positive for HIV, abruptly forcing him into retirement at age 27. From there, Morrison\u2019s life spiraled further and further downward, plagued by drug problems, jail time, and an eventual denial that he had the virus at all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rbwsU5Uwn55kET0Zhuyuag26TRD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
