On a field trip to a museum, Tye meets NoNo, a deaf girl with bionic ears who is working as a museum docent. The two grow closer, until Tye discovers she has a boyfriend and demands she chooses between them. NoNo tells him to come and see her again in twenty years and then disappears from his life, leaving him only with a photo of her in front of a signpost saying Elsewhere. Tye uses the magic stone to go to Elsewhere, but he discovers a desolate world full of discarded things, among them an attractive blind girl, Ya-hung. Two worlds, two realities, two girls, what will Tye\u2019s choice be ?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/neqDMECDhpuR6xdJyQkedhi0B9c.jpg", "actors": ["Yung-Cheng Chang (Tye)", "Chia-ying Lee (NoNo)", "Jozie Lu (Ya-hung)", "Leon Dai (Tye Adult)", "Lee Lieh (Tye's mother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "zLC7vm0H8PQ"}
