At night, from a higher point of view, traffic evokes lava flowing down a volcano.\r Like a giant ant colony, humans have made this planet their own. But what about the Earth? Can we continue to take without consequences?\r The City Limits tries to show that even though humans are the dominant species on the planet, there is something bigger than us.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bJTa0akcB6ScCPFc6ZUGM7sa20.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
