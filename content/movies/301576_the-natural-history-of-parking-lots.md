Lance is in the underworld, running guns, so caring for Chris starts out as a good cover. Then, he warms to his brother, and the two develop a strong bond; Chris gets serious about school and starts to come out of his shell. But, will the relationship be strong enough to weather pressures from Lance's business, Chris's discovery that dad is paying Lance for the care, and Lance's enjoyment of female companionship?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7XRE1tGxdSftVDwgNASlZSPcH9l.jpg", "actors": ["Charlie Bean (Chris)", "B.
