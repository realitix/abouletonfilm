In charge are two magnificent specimens, the butch champion Chigusa Nagaya, still venting her hurt at the hands of her army father as she tries to whip her surrogate daughters through the pain and commitment barriers; and her sophisticated and slightly menacing Chairman. It's a gruelling, physical film, as you would expect, but the makers don't make heavy weather of it. And it certainly disposes of any idea that the game is faked.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mh1Zn1Q3V7CJcIEe6lPJub6XQEj.jpg", "actors": ["Chigusa Nagayo (Herself)", "Meiko Satomura (Herself)", "Yuka Sugiyama (Herself)", "Saika Takeuchi (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
