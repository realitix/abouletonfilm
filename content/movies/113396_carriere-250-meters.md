Carri\u00e8re predicts that between the house he was born in and the cemetery in which he will end there is a life journey of just 250 meters. \"Carri\u00e8re: 250 Meters\" follows him as he reflects on the wealth of global traditions of storytelling, travelling through past and present, across countries and cultures from Paris to New York, Mexico and India and joined by his family, friends and collaborators. A testament to the life and work of an extraordinary man and a key architect in contemporary cinema.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pwg14vtqmQwwpAGwE33pww9fRAO.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Brook ()", "Iris Carriere ()", "Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re ()", "Kiara Alice Carriere (Herself)", "Nahal Tajadod ()", "Phillipe Bathr\u00e9s (Himself)", "Maya Gros ()", "Darius Gros ()", "Enrique Barraza (Himself)", "Pierre \u00c9taix (Himself)", "Mary Ellen Mark (Herself)", "Milo\u0161 Forman (Himself)", "Raghu Rai ()", "Suresh Jindal ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "N0o38_TMz-M"}
