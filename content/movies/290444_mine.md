Throughout the film the imagery shifts between the geological landscape underground inhabited by innumerable black miners and Soho's world of white luxury above ground. When Soho, breakfasting in bed, pushes down the plunger of his cafeti\u00e8re, its movement is transformed into a rapid descent through the tray, through the bed and into the mine-shaft. Here the miners' world of overwhelming misery is depicted in claustrophobic tunnels where they are trapped digging, drilling and sleeping, embedded in rock. Above ground, Soho sits at his desk in his customary pin-stripe suit and punches adding machines and cash registers, creating a flow of gold bars, exhausted miners, blasted landscapes and blocks of uniform housing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o8NuXjzApwunSFIn82L7w69AXet.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
