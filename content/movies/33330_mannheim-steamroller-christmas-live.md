This 56-minute Christmas concert features many favorite numbers from the album Christmas in the Aire, but \"Joy to the World\" perhaps best epitomizes that distinctive Mannheim Steamroller sound: powerful synthesized melodies and harmonies, an intense drive and pathos, and skillful ornamentation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qrt79dYd7xQZpL7tXubfP3gs46D.jpg", "actors": ["Jackson Berkey (Piano)", "Chip Davis (Drummer)", "Arnie Roth (Concertmaster)", "Ron Cooley (Guitar)", "Roxanne Layton (Recorder)", "Chuck Pennington (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
