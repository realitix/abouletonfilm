It also features critical commentary on his intense and ground-breaking conceptualist practice from three of North America\u2019s leading voices on avant-garde poetics. Shot on location in New York in 2007, the lively conversations featured in sucking on words are an ideal introduction to Goldsmith\u2019s witty and provocative works, which are already regarded as hallmarks of 21st-century literature. The film showcases readings from some of his notorious books: No.111 (found phrases ending in the \u2018r\u2019 rhyme and filtered alphabetically by syllable count); Soliloquy (a transcription of every word Goldsmith spoke for a week); Day (a retyping of one day\u2019s New York Times newspaper); Traffic (one day\u2019s worth of hourly radio traffic bulletins); and The Weather (one year\u2019s worth of radio weather bulletins).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dR2LBXMb3SsWY2AIFt9vDjnMMZ9.jpg", "actors": ["Kenneth Goldsmith (Himself)", "Robert Fitterman (Himself)", "Barbara Coles (Herself)", "Bruce Andrews (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
