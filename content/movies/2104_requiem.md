Hunted down, with nowhere to run, they seek refuge in the only place the police cannot follow, a Cistercian monastery. Cut off from the outside world, a nightmare stand off develops between the fugitives, ready to kill in defence of their dearly purchased freedom, and the monks they' re holding hostage.

Requiem' s a violent and fast paced French film that really delivers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aZblXulCCrJsbatuXJoT2bRxHDu.jpg", "actors": ["Jo Prestia (Gipp\u00e9)", "Jean-Louis Loca (Rafik)", "Marc Chapiteau (Poupousse)", "Moussa Maaskri (Marcus)", "Patrick Dell'Isola (Christian)", "Julie-Anne Roth (Carla)", "Simon Eine (Henri)", "Mathieu Busson (Boris)", "Jacques Seiler (Koloustion)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
