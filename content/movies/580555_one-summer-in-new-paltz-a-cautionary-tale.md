The film goes on to document civil disobedience same-sex marriages and demonstrations across New York State, the Nyack Ten legal suit against New York state and the first day of legal same-sex marriages in Boston Massachusetts in May 2004. \"One Summer in New Paltz\", probes into the debate on same-sex marriage examining the intersection of same-sex marriage, war, the Constitution, race and the family. A strong work about grass roots organizing, straight/gay alliances and confrontation with state repression.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tSTTTeoKkBKAAIJOwV3W1VQr2R1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
