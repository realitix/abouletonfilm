He brings the creature home and hides him in his room. Babula takes care of him and the two develop a loving bond. However, when his parents discover the alien, they try to kill him thinking it could harm their child. Babula is deeply upset by this reaction and tells his friend to escape the violence of his world and go back to his own planet. The film contrasts the suspicious nature of adults versus the trusting perspective of children, hinting that be it in this world or another, the most important emotion is compassion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/33mzwH7FzkZgUc0D52znF4huF2i.jpg", "actors": ["Debu Bramha ()", "Anita Das ()", "Gadi ()", "Dada Nathuram ()", "Sarat Pujari ()", "Basant Samal ()", "Sanghamitra ()", "Swastik (Babula)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
