He is a closet homosexual and like many gay men at that time, lives in secret as homosexuality is against the law. One evening he meets Eddie McNally, who is on leave from the air force and the pair embark on an affair together. However, it is their weekend at the estate of Lord Edward Montagu which eventually leads to a scandal which rocked modern Britain and led to a reconsideration of, and the eventual decriminilisation of homosexuality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gPwnHGgnGUzdSvdQfTsankngl6e.jpg", "actors": ["Nicholas Le Prevost (John Wolfenden)", "Harriet Eastcott (Mary Cohen)", "Barny Clevely (Goronwy Rees)", "Sam Heughan (Edward McNally)", "Martin Hutson (Peter Wildeblood)", "Roger Barclay (Stan)", "Eric Carte (Lord Hailsham)", "Orlando Wells (Lord Edward Montagu)", "William Chubb (Chief Constable)", "Karl Davies (John 'Johnny' Reynolds)", "Richard Lintern (Peter Rawlinson)", "Roger Ashton-Griffiths ('Khaki' Roberts)", "Steven Mackintosh (Narrator)", "Kevin Colson (Judge Ormerod)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [23431, 164804, 32700], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
