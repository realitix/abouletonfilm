In debt, he goes to the city to ask the tenants to leave his house, as he intends to sell it and repay his debts. A woman (Suhasini Mulay), her two daughters, Jyoti, Saraswati (Mahima Chaudhry), and one son, Chotu (Master Aditi) are living there. When Dayashankar asks them to vacate, they refuse. What results is Dayashankar's hilarious attempts to force them to vacate - from seeking legal advice; filing police reports; asking goons to remove them - moving in himself.
