The property had recently been left to rot, held in lien by a bank. Hurricanes washed away the sculpture. I learned about the artist who created this landmark, Lewis Vandercar (1913-1988), who began as a painter. His practice grew along with his notoriety for spell-casting and telepathy. Inspired by Vandercar\u2019s interest in parallel possibility, I combined these images with text from local newspaper articles in a haunted-house film that both engages with and looks beyond the material world.\u201d\u2014Mike Stoltz", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xSKB5LBSqTkurFQ6oL25b69Ukvs.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
