Veronica has an unusual companion - Ronnie who is the exact opposite of Veronica. Her friend Niki is a fun loving person and cannot at all understand Veronica's prudishness. At Niki's suggestion, she and Veronica go shopping for some new, sexy clothes for Veronica's changing personality - which becomes the catalyst for a film revealing many layers of sexual denial and redemption.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1dZIEx6wjcCIazSZtNumbhXzbHY.jpg", "actors": ["Lesllie Bovee (Veronica / Ronnie)", "Samantha Fox (Nikki)", "Jamie Gillis (Mark)", "Candida Royalle (Melissa)", "Eric Edwards (David)", "Veri Knotty (Party Girl - Tall Boots)", "Robert Kerman (Ed)", "Bobby Astyr (Dan)", "Michael Gaunt (Party Guy - Purple Shirt)", "George Payne (Guy in Leather Straps)", "Alan Adrian (Pizza Delivery Guy)", "Christine DeShaffer (Submissive Girl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
