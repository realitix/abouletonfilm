It includes extremely rare, never before seen archival footage from the entire spectrum of his career. Featured are scenes from early club dates when Darrell was in his mid-teens during the \"Metal Magic\" days, and continuing through the meteoric rise of Pantera and the final days of Damageplan. Dimebag's offstage antics and his appetite for a great joke and laughter are also on prominent display. It brings back the raw emotion and fond memories of one of metal's truly great musicians! The DVD will be a must have for the huge legion of fans that Pantera and Damageplan amassed over the years. Running time is 73 minutes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/go2skgA2SQ2iC62ft09KyHd8N77.jpg", "actors": ["Dimebag Darrell (Guitarist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "uAcBJTS7Dvk"}
