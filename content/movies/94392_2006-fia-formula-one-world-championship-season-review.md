It was a titanic battle between two of the sport's true greats, Michael Schumacher - in his final F1 season - and Fernando Alonso. Eventually the drivers' championship was decided at the very end of a gripping season.  Three \"new\" teams appeared on the grid in 2006 - Scuderia Toro Rosso (formerly Minardi), Midland F1 (formerly Jordan) and BMW Sauber (formerly Sauber BMW). Super Aguri Honda were a genuinely new team who just barely made it to the first grand prix.  Rule changes included engine limitations (2.4 litre and 8 cylinders), a new qualifying format and the return of tyre changes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/92ePdjjjQ92hyLCy5XKejEM9mAV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
