This is a journey into the dark heart of Native women's experience in Canada. From Vancouver's Skid Row to the Highway of Tears in northern British Columbia, to Saskatoon, this film honours those who have passed and uncovers reasons for hope. Finding Dawn illustrates the deep historical, social and economic factors that contribute to the epidemic of violence against Native women in this country.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/FJZ7r1PDqpNhJnUC2W3VQ208cE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
