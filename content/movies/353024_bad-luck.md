The security company calls one resident, who begins his hunt for the intruder; two other residents are also alerted by the sounds of flatulence, so they too are on the hunt, one armed with a gun, one with a golf club. A noisy toilet-roll holder adds to the burglar's problems.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bgj3heDbdOHIVO55Alb9xekYxOj.jpg", "actors": ["John Buijsman ()", "Karen van Holst Pellekaan ()", "Jop Kappelhoff ()", "Dic van Duin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
