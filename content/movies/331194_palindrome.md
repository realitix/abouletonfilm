For Palindrome, Frampton selected images which he described as \u201ctending towards the biomorphic,\u201d resembling abstract surrealist painting.  However, the rigid palindromic structure that Frampton imposes on the images\u2014a motorized sequence based on \u201ctwelve variations on each of forty congruent phrases\u201d\u2014deviates from the subjective aesthetic of the expressive, demonstrating Frampton\u2019s interest in the \u201cgenerative power\u201d of films composed by rules and principles.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jr2ji4MNPpf1qztIadbwvHTyLBG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [211244, 257906, 359457, 183108], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
