One single woman. Both are in their 40\u2019s. They sleep together on the day they first meet.  \"Camel(s)\" is a one-night story of a middle-aged couple who visited a small port village named 'Wol-got' in the west coast. Unlike the classical love story, \"Camel(s)\" offers you a different taste of how a love affair can grow between two complete strangers in a black-and-white tone. The man (Lee Dae-yeon), as a chauffeur, brings the woman (Park Myung-shin) to 'Wol-got', a used-to-be village but now a small town full of motels, sashimi and karaoke bars. Having no idea of who each other is, the two middle-aged people sit in the corner of a sashimi bar and start chatting. They have dinner together.  They sing karaoke together. They head for a motel together and finally they sleep together?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/30NZT3tZnyOy2YzaeLjo34p9cpL.jpg", "actors": ["Lee Dae-yeon (Lee Man-sup)", "Park Myung-shin (Myeong-heui)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [153423, 292818, 123997, 203927], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
