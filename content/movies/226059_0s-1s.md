Life is Easy 2.0 for James Pongo. He has a cushy job, a busy social life and an alluring love interest all through the click of a mouse. But when he wakes up after a night of reckless partying to discover that his computer is missing, James' hyper-connected reality takes a nosedive. This sends him on a picaresque journey of interrogations and humiliations with the suburban losers he left behind. Told entirely through the websites, programs, games and social networks that make up our daily lives, 0s &amp; 1s uses James Pongo's nihilistic adventure to question our growing dependency on these alternate digital realities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ekaxBSuu7PAwuwV26tCBSMaETQu.jpg", "actors": ["Ahna O'Reilly (Caitlin)", "Alexi Wasser (Becky)", "Morgan Krantz (James Pongo)", "Jeremy Blackman (Sam)", "Ryan Reyes (Cole)", "Matthew Cardarople (Donny)", "Sara Swain (Kasey)", "Mara LaFontaine (Sammy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "hOZManPpaVE"}
