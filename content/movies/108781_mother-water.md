In this tranquil setting, three women join the flow of a small community with the subtle presence of a spring breeze. Setsuko , the proprietor of a whiskey-only bar; Takako, the owner of a coffee shop along the waterway; Hatsumi, a maker of tofu so delicious it seems to spring forth from the clear water. Under their subtle influence, other townspeople gradually begin their own streams too: Yamanoha, a local worker for a furniture workshop; Otome, the owner of a neighborhood public bath; Jin, a young man who assists him at the bath; Makoto, a wayfarer about the town. Among their daily lives, there is Poplar, a small child with a perpetually friendly smile.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e4bKQgGJs3qd9TB960YCXVEwpkp.jpg", "actors": ["Satomi Kobayashi ()", "Mikako Ichikawa ()", "Kyoko Koizumi ()", "Ryo Kase ()", "Kento Nagayama ()", "Ken Mitsuishi ()", "Masako Motai ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
