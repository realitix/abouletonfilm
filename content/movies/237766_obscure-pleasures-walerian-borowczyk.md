While he had used both encyclopedias and dictionaries to order chaos in his own films, this list saw Borowczyk putting his own life in order. Using the list as a starting point, \u201cObscure Pleasures\u201d offers a portrait of Borowczyk that encompasses all facets of his artistic personality, including his post-impressionist paintings, socialist realist drawings, film posters, groundbreaking animations, and revolutionary short films, not to mention the taboo-busting films of the 1970s.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Walerian Borowczyk (Himself)", "Freddy Buache (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
