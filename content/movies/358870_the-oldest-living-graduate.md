Henry Fonda stars as Col. J. C. Kincaid, crusty patriarch of a Texas family. Kincaid's weak-willed son Floyd (George Grizzard) wants to get into the old man's good graces so that he, Floyd, can develop the Colonel's vast land ownings. Floyd arranges a city-wide celebration lauding Kincaid as the oldest living graduate of nearby military academy. The festivities serve only to make the already sour Kincaid even more truculent and miserable.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lU2e5VVll06qqKAHMPSfpweg9Mk.jpg", "actors": ["Henry Fonda (Colonel J.C.
