At the famous Puccini Festival in Torre del Lago (2014), where Puccini composed his main operas, La Boh\u00e8me is directed by one of Italy\u2019s greatest film directors: Ettore Scola, the creator of a high number of award-winning seminal films. As he explains in the programme notes, as soon as he was approached to stage La Boh\u00e8me he had to fight hard to resist the temptation to give life to his \u201crevolutionary\u201d ideas; in the end, he decided for a traditional looking, rich, grandiose and detailed Boh\u00e8me. Together with the exceptional cast of Daniela Dess\u00ec, Fabio Armiliato, Alessandro Luongo, Marco Spotti and Alida Berti, this production makes for an incomparable great performance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2O8VeshbGlUwFo77EjZzPgGKoIG.jpg", "actors": ["Daniela Dess\u00ec (Mimi)", "Fabio Armiliato (Rodolfo)", "Alessandro Luongo (Marcello)", "Alida Berti (Musetta)", "Valerio Galli (Conductor)", "Marco Spotti (Colline)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "I1vl1XwHX_Q"}
