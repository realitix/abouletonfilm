Then he talks about how he became writer and than director at Film Studious in Stokholm and about the movies he made during this period. Then he describes how he discovered the island of Faro and come to live and work there later. Particularly interesting because of it's autobiographical aspect: we see Ingmar Bergman\u00b4s life and how he made his films through his own eyes and described with his own words.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
