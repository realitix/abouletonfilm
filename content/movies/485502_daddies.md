It\u2019s more than just a question of age. Leather Daddies, Daddy Bears and Daddies that don\u2019t fit into the usual categories. They talk about their Daddy identity, gay relationships, polyamory, and appetite for sex. Monogamy and open relationships co-exist in San Francisco as they do everywhere, but nowhere else has so many polyamorous men, men who embrace multiple love in their own personal way within the community. It is not just daddy/son, there are also guys in a number of relationships, or men in triads or foursomes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nJ8ds1UVtiAjphEnqoymj1mRPnP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
