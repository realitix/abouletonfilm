His latest fling is Yoshino (Matsushima Hikari), who is only stringing Yuichi along until she finds someone better. After an unpleasant encounter between the two, Yoshino is found dead, and Yuichi quickly becomes the main suspect when the police determine that arrogant college student Masuo (Okada Masaki) was not the last person to see her alive. Meanwhile, Yuichi meets lonely shop clerk Mitsuyo (Fukatsu Eri), and the two begin an intense love affair. As Yuichi's grandmother becomes the victim of brutal con artists, and Yoshino's father finds out that Masuo is more responsible for Yoshino's death than he seems, perhaps Yuichi isn't the biggest villain of the case after all.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
