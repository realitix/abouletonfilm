In all Doubt on Loan focuses on the dysfunctional librarians of Shawcross Library and Interactive centre, as they navigate their way through running a failing library in our increasingly hyper-modern technology based world, relationships and their pasts. Making matters worse their warped views, and precarious judgments often lead them to trouble, creating a myriad of uncomfortable situations that usually only get worse before they get better (which doesn't often happen).", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Louise Ford (Mia)", "Christian Brassington (Nic)", "David Fynn (Eddie)", "Sophie Colquhoun (Charlie)", "Bentley Kalu (Philip Dunleavy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
