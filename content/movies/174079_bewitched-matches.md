Leaving their matchbox, they line the film in circular, concentric movements.  In an almost aquatic momentum, the squadron of little bits of wood mould the contours of a character, a run-of-the-mill smoker, before transforming into a funny harness.  The film ends when the matches, again transformed, take on the appearance of a distinguished man who, after several attempts, finally finds a way of lighting his cigarette.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kpHfn6KL9XzXxbNCGHNyblhHx2v.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
