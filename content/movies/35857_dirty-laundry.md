His mother Evelyn, a laundress who is stubborn, ornery, opinionated, mean-spirited, insulting, and inflexible, has sent a ten-year-old boy who says he's Sheldon's son up to see Sheldon. Sheldon comes home to straighten things out. Old arguments flare up - between mother and son and between brothers. Sheldon wants no part of fatherhood or family. Then, someone else from New York shows up at Evelyn's door, bringing a new set of challenges. Will this family ever stop airing its dirty laundry? And what of Sheldon: where is his pride? Can he, in the words of James Baldwin, go where his blood beats and live the life he has?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dr5KL1ic9UhfkdvOy3Rs7OBaT1S.jpg", "actors": ["Rockmond Dunbar (Patrick / Sheldon)", "Loretta Devine (Evelyn)", "Jenifer Lewis (Aunt Lettuce)", "Terri J.
