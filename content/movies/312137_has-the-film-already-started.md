During these 60 minutes of waiting, people on the first floor of the building will shake out very dusty carpets, and someone else will throw ice water on the heads of those spectators waiting for the screening. Some actors who have infiltrated the crowd will insult other actors on the first floor. At this moment only, and to stop the beginning of a scandal, the doors of the theatre will open\u2026\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vzg8m4H2JHiQsCP82vBEjrWnw0r.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
