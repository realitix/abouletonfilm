Mostly told from the point-of-view of a young, sexually aggressive woman, named Chance, whom according to her: \"we're all out there looking for true love\", which turns out to be a very elusive thing indeed, and Chance is no exception. She's desperately on the prowl for a man, but since she's more mouse than cat, she gets herself into scrape after scrape in her screwball pursuit of love. Surrounded by a bevy of adoring but completely wrong-for-her men (and one dead girl from Manchester, England), Chance has to pick her way through her messy life in order to figure out which guy is \"it\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7lDbZ2YpdD0wQWJLVu2c2mgNgPq.jpg", "actors": ["Amber Benson (Chance)", "James Marsters (Simon)", "Christine Estabrook (Desiree)", "Andy Hallett (Jack)", "David Fury (Pizza Delivery Guy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
