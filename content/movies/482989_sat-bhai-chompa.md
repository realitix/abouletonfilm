This, the 1968 version directed by Dilip Shom, is one of the most delightful. A king has three wives. The two elder wives connive to throw the pregnant third wife out of the palace. The third wife gives birth to eight children - seven sons and a daughter. The enraged elder wives, with the help of a sorcerer, turn the seven sons into flowers. It is now up to the daughter to turn her brothers back into humans and regain their rightful place in the palace.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k9lRVQm4vMAV6P21UvP4VZA3Wow.jpg", "actors": ["Azim ()", "Anwar Hossain ()", "Khan Ataur Rehman ()", "Kabori Sarwar ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
