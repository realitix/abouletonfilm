In reality, the roll was to be awarded to Lu Panther, the untalented girlfriend of the theatre's owner, Wildner.  After a series of accidents and little disasters, Wildner shuts down the theatre before the Revue can take place.  But the Revue's director, Ernst Eder, decides shortly thereafter to present the Revue on an ice skating rink belonging to Liesl's uncle.  After a successful run, at first at the Wiener Prater, the performers move on to Spain, Hungary, and a night club with a Jazz orchestra.  The Revue becomes a huge success ... and, of course, Ernst and Liesl end up together, too.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qsRRc0OBnVRcyGbkHk0GYLV7ARq.jpg", "actors": ["Olly Holzmann (Liesl Strolz)", "Wolf Albach-Retty (Ernst Eder)", "Fritz Imhoff (Meister Strolz)", "Oskar Sima (Josef Wildner)", "Rudolf Carl (Toni)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
