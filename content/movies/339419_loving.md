L'\u00c9tat de Virginie o\u00f9 les Loving ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de s'installer les poursuit en justice : le couple est condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 une peine de prison, avec suspension de la sentence \u00e0 condition qu'il quitte l'\u00c9tat. Consid\u00e9rant qu'il s'agit d'une violation de leurs droits civiques, Richard et Mildred portent leur affaire devant les tribunaux. Ils iront jusqu'\u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame qui, en 1967, casse la d\u00e9cision de la Virginie. D\u00e9sormais, l'arr\u00eat \"Loving v.

The message was awesome, but it's more like a personal. At least from the film's perspective about a couple and their struggle. Also the personalities of those two, who are so quiet, hence seems it was like a documentary film with a feature film touch. That does not mean Ruth Negga deserved the Oscars nominee. She got it only because of the black quota, otherwise there are many great performances to be considered who are not white, black or even American.\r\n\r\nSo coming to the film, I like this kind of drama, It was so realistic and I won't mind if it runs past two hour mark. The first appreciation must go the two lead actors, they were the soul of the film. Surely awards worthy performances, but like I said not the Oscars. Especially I loved the Joel Edgerton's part. It is one of his, maybe the best I have seen so far, For many reasons the people should watch this. Jeff Nichols of 'Take Shelter' fame did good in writing and direction, especially after his slightly disappointing previous film. One of the best biopic of the year and I recommend it not to miss, particularly for the family audience.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"}], "recommandations_id": [342737, 393457, 376866, 339408], "youtube_key": "33g-ZHBQdNU"}
