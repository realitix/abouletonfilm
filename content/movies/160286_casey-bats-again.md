Eventually, a child is born but, to Casey's dismay, it's a girl, not a boy. His wife suggests they try again several more times but each time, it's still another girl. Casey is depressed but his pals tell him that in spite of everything, they still make a powerful baseball team. Casey likes the idea and accepts. However, the day of the big game, he is nervous that one of them will strike out and attempts to make the last home run himself disguised as one of his own daughters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6b1XHxKIJc386odmMqzuq63htnl.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Frees (narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [67585, 53178, 34711, 234393], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
