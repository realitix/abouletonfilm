He's alternatively sensitive and brutal with Kristen, who wants a sexual relationship that he explosively rejects. Late one night, as he's closing the cafe where he works, a young Black man attempts to rob him at gun point but faints from illness. Seth takes the man, Knowledge, an escapee from a nearby prison, to a family cabin where he nurses him and they begin a tentative friendship. When the sheriff learns of Seth's harboring a fugitive, a confrontation looms. Relationships between fathers and their children dominate the subplots.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pmaJCkKTiH7YOkF822mLeaSDgur.jpg", "actors": ["Gabriel Mann (Seth Carlson)", "Laurence Mason (Knowledge Johnson)", "Murphy Guyer (Sheriff Mott)", "Graham Alex Johnson (Peter Carlson)", "Heather Gottlieb (Kristen Mott)", "Josh Hopkins (Marty)", "Maureen Shannon (Francine)", "Julia Weldon (Sally Carlson)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "LuvNJVbNqG4"}
