From Sheffield the landscape changes from one of hills and heavy industry to the rural flatlands of North Lincolnshire.  One of the highlights of this journey of contrasts, is the much photographed array of semaphore signals at Wrawby Junction, viewed from the Driver's cab just weeks before abolition. Threading our way through the back streets of Grimsby Town on a single line, we finish our journey at the popular seaside town of Cleethorpes.  Filmed in the summer of 2015.  Narrated by Alan Hardwick.  Written by Peter Middleton.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/erEMlZMsEaKyJDrNanIOqeksWhA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
