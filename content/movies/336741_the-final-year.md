There is no escape from the pressure on children to score as high as possible on tests to get into the best secondary schools. Parents who can afford it pay for as many private lessons as possible; other parents put pressure on the teachers. This documentary shows pupils and parents from very different backgrounds going through this process. They struggle anxiously for the same goal: the best possible start in life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6LM3syvCg1v1KdAhyUeJ549w2KX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
