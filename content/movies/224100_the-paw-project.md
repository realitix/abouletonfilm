She starts a grassroots movement that is fueled by passion, but appears to be losing the battle. Then, unexpectedly, she realizes that the corporations accidentally left her a giant loophole. In a scramble to take advantage of this unforeseen gift, she leads the crusade passing legislation protecting animals from de-clawing in seven cities in just six weeks.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2APDMz9l55lYjTjEIlbunhX1Gba.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Qw8OJN4ctyo"}
