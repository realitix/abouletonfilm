Given he is not very knowledgeable about soccer, Ugo tries -several times but in vain - to obtain an appointment from Sivori. Forced to fall back upon persons being or having been in contact with the elusive star, he gets to know young forward-center Moretti and soon becomes friendly with him. The young man confides in him and tells him the whole truth about his own \"career\" : the training in a small provincial team, the promising debut alongside Sivori, the desertion of his fianc\u00e9e, the premature decline due to a dissolute life. When Sanfelice finally meets Sivori, he finds that the star is no match - humanely at least - for Moretti and he gives up writing the book at all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jBxaDZma47ciHvTt1UnQ7nxfnbl.jpg", "actors": ["Massimo Girotti (Ugo Sanfelice)", "Omar Sivori (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
