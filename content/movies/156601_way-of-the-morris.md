And yet to your average man on the street, its seen as little more than a national joke. And a bad national joke at that. Something to ridicule. Something to be embarrassed about.  A heartfelt docu-ballad in praise of birthplace, bloodline and rural brotherhood, WAY OF THE MORRIS follows Tim on a deeply personal journey from the barleyfields of his childhood to the killing fields of The Somme, as he traces the poignant link between the spirited folk revival of the mid-1970s and the true story of the young Adderbury Morris side so decimated by the carnage of the First World War.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ajqVZ6aQpwVeJk3sonfHdXgfVpY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
