In 1943, a 24-year-old maths student and a GPO engineer combined to hack into Hitler's personal super-code machine - not Enigma but an even tougher system, which he called his 'secrets writer'. Their break turned the Battle of Kursk, powered the D-day landings and orchestrated the end of the conflict in Europe. But it was also to be used during the Cold War - which meant both men's achievements were hushed up and never officially recognized.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Ap8HzzGmEjQfTehCt9KUoPA5Uog.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
