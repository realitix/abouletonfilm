As a hatamoto (bannerman, or direct retainer of the shogun) Mondonosuke has a crescent scar on his forehead, which is a license to go above the law in order to protect the shogunate. In this exciting entry in the series, a vicious plot using ninja to curse the shogun leads to a showdown with the Owari clan, one of the 3 branch families of the Tokugawa.  Will Mondonosuke be able to discover who is behind the conspiracy in time to save His Excellency from a hideous death? Starring the great Ichikawa Utaemon in his signature role, this film is a high point in the long-running series.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1sYc7Ul2aQypuW2LMIQckgTVWPt.jpg", "actors": ["Utaemon Ichikawa (Saotome Mondonosuke)", "Kotaro Satomi ()", "S\u00f4 Yamamura ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
