The city, oddly enough, spawned the grunge movement in the early '90s and killed off many of the '80s metal bands. A career-spanning selection of material in this concert includes early classics such as \"Barracuda\" and \"Crazy on You,\" alongside more recent material.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9xE4AS7qMmbSLbCOcGjTWDEqNNe.jpg", "actors": ["Ann Wilson (Herself (lead vocals))", "Nancy Wilson (Herself (lead guitar))", "Scott Olson (Guitar)", "Mike Inez (Bass)", "Ben Smith (Drums)", "Tom Kellock (Keyboards)", "Steve Fossen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
