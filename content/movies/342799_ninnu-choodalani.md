Here is a good example of how the infrastructure can be played around and can be ill utilized without yielding any results. Poor screenplay adds up to the poor emoting by the lead pair giving a torrid time to the visitors despite of having a good music. This film offers nothing except for satisfying the curiosity level of audience about NTR."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
