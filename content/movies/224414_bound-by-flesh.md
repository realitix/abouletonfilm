Taught to sing and dance at an early age, the winsome duo ascended through the early 20th-century vaudeville circuit as a side attraction (working alongside Bob Hope and Charlie Chaplin as well as a memorable turn in the Tod Browning classic \"Freaks\") before a cascade of unscrupulous management and harsh mistreatment brought their careers (and lives) tumbling down. This engrossing glimpse into a bygone era is filled with fascinating interviews and rare archival footage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wUl7g0NhYaWRZ2WgWytzHFscPdi.jpg", "actors": ["Lea Thompson (Voiceover)", "Nancy Allen (Voiceover)", "Tim Stack (Voiceover)", "Blake Boyd (Voiceover)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [284550, 105379, 253265, 325758], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
