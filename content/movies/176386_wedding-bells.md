In fact, he has the marriage license just about in hand. Apparently, he's had a bachelor party the night before and when his fianc\u00e9e rings him, he can't find the phone, but there's several other guys sleeping it off. The landlady suspects that some hijinks have gone on and looks to investigate. Monty figures things out pretty quickly. Luckily for him, one of the gentlemen sleeping it off is in a policeman's uniform and Monty has him pretend he's arrested everybody in the room.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Monty Banks (The Groom)", "Ena Gregory ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
