He puts his helmet on a shrunken old woman whom he meets by chance in a shop. As soon as he presses the buttons on the helmet one by one, she suddenly remembers forgotten happy moments and is rejuvenated. This is just the beginning. Kanjaki goes on to make the village people recall their happy pasts, but his face is lined with worry and a sadness that deepens. What is the secret of this helmet? And what is he trying to do with it?  Director Sabu\u2019s Happiness suggests happiness and suffering are intertwined through the unusual scenario of a helmet reminding people of the happiest moments of their lives. Sabu convincingly portrays the notion that memory is the source of both happiness and suffering, and how memory affects our lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nHlr9dK0orrZwtx1ACbXn8sJYz2.jpg", "actors": ["Masatoshi Nagase (Kanzaki)", "Erika Okuda ()", "Hiroki Suzuki ()", "Tetsuya Chiba ()", "Arisa Nakajima (Ryoko Inoue)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
