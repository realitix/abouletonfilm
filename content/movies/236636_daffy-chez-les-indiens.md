He falls for an Indian maiden with a Brooklyn accent, but her very large boyfriend catches them. Daffy dresses in drag, which fools him for a while until Daffy's wig falls off. The boyfriend chases Daffy into the Petrified Forest (where Daffy freezes and breaks tomahawks). The Indian sends smoke signals from a phone booth and his tribe attacks Daffy, trapping him under his house trailer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/am2UFPzMPbnCWHxqsLpcW7lwZNx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
