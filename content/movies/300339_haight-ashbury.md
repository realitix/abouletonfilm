What would come to be coined \"the San Francisco Sound\" served as the soundtrack for a counter- culture revolution that would forever challenge the perception of the American ideal. This movement climaxed in a single California season known as the Summer of Love, in a neighborhood that provided a canvas for this artistic burst of imagination: Haight-Ashbury.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
