Drawing on my own extensive Super 8 archive and a growing body of Mini DV footage the film portrays a fragmented and nostalgic view of a part of the world that has proved vital to the very fabric of my existence.  Amongst the sonic flotsam and jetsam lie littoral truths, half-truths and coastal myths. Both melancholic and absurd the \u2018coastcard\u2019 is a confusing missive from a place of hope.  It is a reminisce and flawed celebration. Hastings as a place where both memories and people are pulled towards the sea in a strange state of \u2018reverse evolution\u2019.\" \u2013 Andrew K\u00f6tting", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Iain Sinclair ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
