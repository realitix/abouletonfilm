EPICA seemed to have found the perfect musical mixture between classical and heavy music. With every new album the Dutch band pushes the boundaries by reinventing their distinctive style, and nothing seems to stop them on their rise to the top. From Simone Simons' angelic opera vocals to Mark Jansen's death grunts and the classical composition playing alongside the rocking riffs and great drumming, it\u2019s all top-notch.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/urgSr7MJZ4OGWHkiR4O6X7imZk3.jpg", "actors": ["Simone Simons (Herself)", "Mark Jansen (Himself)", "Coen Janssen (Himself)", "Ari\u00ebn Van Weesenbeek (Himself)", "Isaac Delahaye (Himself)", "Rob van der Loo (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
