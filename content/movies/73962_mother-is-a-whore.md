Do-all filmmaker Lee Sang Woo writes, produces, directs, and stars in this shocking drama about an impoverished HIV-positive man forced to pimp out his 60-year-old mother (Lee Yong Nyeo) to make ends meet. Angry about his mother's suffering and his own sickness, Sang Woo rages against his father (Kwon Bum Taek), who left them for a younger woman (Kim Ji Hee). It turns out his father's life isn't doing so well either with a fanatically religious wife and her dysfunctional children. A notable rising name in Korean indie cinema, Lee Sang Woo has drawn comparisons to early Kim Ki Duk with his dark family dramas Mother is a Whore and Father is a Dog.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nGuYYLJIRGyp1wtIhwLFQcgUdij.jpg", "actors": ["Lee Sang-woo (Son)", "Lee Yong-nyeo (Mother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
