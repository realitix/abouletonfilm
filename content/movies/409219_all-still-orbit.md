Everything about Brasilia was devised and designed, but not on the basis of some cold urban design concept: the plan proves to originate from 19th-century priest Don Bosco\u2019s dream. The chaos and disorder of the adjacent construction workers' village Vila Amauri long stood in stark contrast to the grandeur and majestic regularity of Brasilia. Now the village has disappeared beneath the reservoir\u2019s surface, the necessary order has been restored. All Still Orbit examines both these histories.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/129TmhwYlvgjOWn7PnBCgEwRPUi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
