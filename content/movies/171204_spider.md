She visits his studio and finds herself swept up into the bizarre world of the artist and his bohemian friends. She seems to see his paintings come to life and is pursued by strange shadowy figures. Later she has nightmarish visions of the artist visiting her at night in the form of a huge spider. The next morning she finds marks on her body that look like the bites of a large insect. Vita\u2019s mother becomes worried about her and sends the girl off to stay with relatives in the countryside, believing that the change of environment will help her to recover. However, it seems the dark forces that threatened Vita in the city have followed her and an ancient evil is being awakened that feeds off Vita\u2019s burgeoning sexuality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hdFNi5hKk0Do9Vou6T56z841DpK.jpg", "actors": ["Aurelija Anuzhite (Vita)", "Mirdza Martinsone (Mother)", "Liubomiras Laucevicius (Albert (as Liubomiras Lauciavicius))", "Saulius Balandis (Young Man)", "Algirdas Paulavi\u010dius (Priest)", "Romualds Anc\u0101ns (Old Man)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
