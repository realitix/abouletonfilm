He gets onto the team, only to find that he must dive the high platform in order to compete. His problems are further compounded by social issues out of the pool. His sister is being taken advantage of by the local tough-guy, and his coach writes him off as a loser. To aid in his overcoming of his phobia, he enlists in a previous women's olympic coach, whom he falls for and crosses the line between business and pleasure.

He ignores these warnings, and enters the competition.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8qZomyT8eJw1t6neb1T5EFMLSv.jpg", "actors": ["Matt Lattanzi (Jerome Colter)", "Matt Adler (Wayne Hopkins)", "Kristy Swanson (Terry Hopkins)", "Burt Young (Coach Mack)", "Richard Johnson (Richard Anthony)", "Abraham Benrubi (Rick)", "Yolande Jilot (Amanda Lansky)", "Carey Scott (Ryes Wallstien)", "Thomas Callaway (Jim Hopkins)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
