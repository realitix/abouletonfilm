Jan had successfully bred dogs and birds and believed she could do the same with a different animal \u2013 though she knew nothing about racing and had never been on a horse. Convincing a handful of locals to part with ten pound a week for her scheme, she found a thoroughbred mare with a terrible racing record for \u00a3300, a stallion past his best, put them together and \u2013 against all the odds \u2013 bred a winner.  It\u2019s an audacious tale of luck and chance and beating the odds; a story of how a gaggle of working class folk from the Welsh Valleys took on the racing elite, broke through class and financial barriers, and brought hope and pride back to their depressed community.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b0hyVLGAD31L0yzjB4eKSavVc7f.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [333319, 358923, 118491, 217057], "youtube_key": "DulrxbnzF2U"}
