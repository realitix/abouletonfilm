The film navigates 'truth' by engaging twenty-six witnesses with diverse experiences into conversation. By facilitating a voice for individuals whose lives have been tragically affected, with observations and recommendations by experts who have worked directly with the agency (such as doctors, social workers and lawyers), the film reveals a child welfare system plagued by systemic and bureaucratic abuse that urgently requires public attention. Financed by tax dollars and wielding extraordinary power, the Children's Aid Society is deconstructed to reveal a broken system where employees have been heard to describe their influence over children and families to be as powerful as god.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AoR14Q8zyl3t8ajGllDDHMIGqTu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
