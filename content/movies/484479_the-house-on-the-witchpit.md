No plot synopsis, cast list or trailer was issued. The only image released was the teaser poster. Subsequent to the screening, director Pat Higgins physically destroyed both the master copy and the only back-up live on the stage, effectively destroying that version of the film.  Higgins made a new version of the film available to rent through Vimeo On Demand--for only one day-- on Halloween 2017.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6w7CkjhxG3njQ4k9isoWMzQPLrP.jpg", "actors": ["Melissa Coyne (Toni/Tonya)", "Cy Henty (John Canning)", "Liza Keast (Rebecca Woods)", "Mike Reddihough (Damon Reid)", "Les Cannon (Ralph Horton)", "Pat Higgins (James Trick)", "Melany Dantes (Callie)", "Paul Cousins (Fletcher)", "Tony Sweeney (Harry)", "Ken Mortimer (Lanky 414)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
