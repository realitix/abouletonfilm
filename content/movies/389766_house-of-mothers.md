At the centre of this small community of teenagers and their new-borns, the exclusively female staff see to it that the residents, whose family situations are chaotic, obey the rules. Keeping off-screen an often-mentioned violence, the film focuses on the daily lessons in mothering. What then emerges is everything that cannot be taught and which creates a fine dividing line between having a child and becoming a mother.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9QXFR5vaWntApJ7hTJ0HFrel8Pk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
