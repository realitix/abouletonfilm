A mother of three, the wife of a relatively prosperous bank executive, and a woman who enjoys a comfortably middle-class existence, Mi-ae grows increasingly frustrated by her two sons\u2019 demeaning behavior towards her, her boorish husband\u2019s unforgivable cheapness, and her own sadness at never having felt for herself the joys of true love \u2014 something she becomes acutely aware of when observing her estranged daughter\u2019s loving relationship with another woman. After abruptly leaving a disastrous anniversary evening arranged by her thoughtless husband, Mi-ae meets the shy and kind Soo-nim, her youngest son\u2019s schoolmate. Choosing to spend a long evening with Soo-nim rather than return home to the male members of her family, Mi-ae finds herself irresistibly drawn to this gentle young woman as a flood of emotions sweeps Mi-ae away on an unexpected journey of self-discovery.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Cho Joo-kyoung ()", "Lee Joo-ah ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
