It\u2019s about the renaissance which jazz has experienced over the past few years. It\u2019s also about friendship, community and the influences of the city that these musicians call home. The film tells the journey of these young, gifted players, many of whom have trained and come up together, and whose sounds are now becoming an integral part of London\u2019s musical landscape \u2013 as well as representing the city around the UK and the rest of the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/erdTVIBQBYqTGKKoKIsqrX921sJ.jpg", "actors": ["Sheila Maurice-Grey (Herself)", "Theon Cross (Himself)", "Shabaka Hutchings (Himself)", "Dominic Canning (Himself)", "Moses Boyd (Himself)", "Jake Long (Himself)", "Nubya Garcia (Herself)", "Adam Moses (Himself)", "Femi Koleoso (Himself)", "Joe Armon-Jones (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "NwCCfWiYk2s"}
