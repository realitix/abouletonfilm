Since its patenting in the early 1960's, the compact audio cassette has changed the way that we listen, think, and communicate. From its humble origins as a transcription aid to its eventual loss of popularity after the invention of the compact disc and MP3 player, the cassette tape has come to be regarded a major cultural artifact, both in terms of its lasting impact on society and its current relevance in the Third World and the international independent music scene. Although the cassette tape has mostly faded from mainstream relevance in the Western world, it remains an important cultural touchstone for a generation of music listeners, and its less-direct influence is still felt today.  Produced in the Media Artists Studio program at The Evergreen State College 2011-2012.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
