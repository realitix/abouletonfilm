In the first two reels, which have been lost, a woman caught in an abusive marriage runs away with her infant son from her drunken husband. He falls on a knife and dies and she collapses in the bush. The child wanders off and is found by one family; the mother is rescued by another family and is unaware that her son lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pxcpQ1l5p8hUhciRdz9Rp5HApGF.jpg", "actors": ["Lottie Lyell (The Daughter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
