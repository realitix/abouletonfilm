Their relationship is hardly conventional: in fact, it is unconsummated. Dino gets out of it, gratifying himself with prostitutes and swingers. He reaches his nadir when he looks up Anna\u2019s old boyfriends to ask about their sexual relations with her, and even begs them to take her back, as a way to end their relationship. Anna can\u2019t find a way out herself; she can\u2019t bring herself to end this one-of-a-kind, tormented love affair. In the end, Dino\u2019s angst is what makes her feel loved, feel unique. No solution seems to be waiting in the wings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7rNnvmmLsEWFgWY7xSHfHvFQ93j.jpg", "actors": ["Isabella Ferrari (Anna)", "Jean-Marc Barr (Dino)", "Luca Argentero (Alessandro)", "Filippo Nigro (Mauro)", "Eva Riccobono (La prostituta sfregiata)", "Anita Kravos (L'altra prostituta)", "Jean-Pierre Lorit (Ing.
