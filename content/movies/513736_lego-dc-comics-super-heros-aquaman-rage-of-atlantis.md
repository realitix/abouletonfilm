Let's hope it is worse than the other _Aquaman_ movie coming out this year though.\r\n\r\nIt's bad, but having a definitive lead character, and the rest of the heroes as a supporting cast is working better than the ones where they try to make everyone share the spotlight equally.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"}], "recommandations_id": [504997, 487670]}
