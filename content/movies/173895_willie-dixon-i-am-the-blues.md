Among the highlights of the gig are a spunky rendition of Built For Comfort and the stirring, little-known composition Peace; its simplistic lyrics and heartfelt sentiments make it a bluesy first cousin to John Lennon's Give Peace A Chance. Interspersed with the great music are warm recollections from Dixon as he covers topics ranging from composing to his mid 1960s re-emergence in England via cover versions of his best material courtesy of The Rolling Stones and Cream (which featured long time admirer Eric Clapton).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cKF9aT4tEQ4HefmpWsbbF3RHzP5.jpg", "actors": ["Willie Dixon (Vocals, Stand-Up Bass)", "Baby Doo Casten (Vocals, Piano, Organ)", "John Watkins (Guitar)", "Arthur \"Butch\" Dixon (Piano)", "Carey Bell Harrington (Chromatic Harmonica)", "Mike Morrison (Electric Bass)", "Clifton James (Drums)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
