These youths were the rebel generation who were also searching for an identity. They created a music - a sub genre of reggae known as Lovers Rock. This music became a global brand through artists like UB40 and Maxi Priest. The music brought a level of intimacy between young people that was unique. It was also 'girl power' music that empowered a generation of young women. Through comedy, live performance, dance, interviews and archive the film takes you back to an untold era of British cultural, music and political history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9swaGoRpivHujpYaOeZba1YzWvE.jpg", "actors": ["Levi Roots (Levi Roots)", "UB40 ()", "Janet Kay Baxter ()", "Aswad ()", "Maxi Priest ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "TiJof_zx2Uk"}
