Elohim was photographed in early spring, the week of the Lunar New Year, the very spirit of Creation. Abaton was photographed a few weeks later in the full ripeness of spring, the very purity and passion of the Garden. Coda was photographed in late spring, in the aftermath of this purity, the first shades of mortality and Knowledge appearing. And finally, Ode, photographed in early summer, is a soft, textured song of the Fallen, the dissonant reds of death, seeds and rebirth. \u2013 Nathaniel Dorsky", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9MeHjyTXOaBRc0sewYTsL0YLzOq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
