It's a \"great day for the beach\" when our handsome, likable California surfer-blond hero runs into some pals. Unused to alcohol, he gets very high on buddy Joe's vodka (stashed in a 7-Up bottle), leaving him ill-equipped to drive the car he's just brought home. Things get ever more ghoulish as he witnesses the bleak and tearful events that follow his tragic demise. One assumes many a classroom was left either giggling or traumatized (or both) as he screams his final pleas to God as he's being buried. That's edutainment!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8yAkPvOjZp4pmRmNlnFbxvgLVvw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
