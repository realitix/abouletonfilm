Ben, his best friend from college, also gets the call.  Arriving just in time for his funeral, it becomes quickly obvious to them that the little slice of small-town America in which they find themselves is like an episode of The Twilight Zone featuring Frank's eccentric friends, his amazing secrets and his stunning final request.  Both Ben and Roberta are shocked to discover that Frank not only had a child, but that he has left them responsible for his son's care.
