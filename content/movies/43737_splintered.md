In the hope of satiating her obsession with the latter, she instigates a trip to the Welsh countryside with four friends, aimed at tracking down the legendary Beast of Bodmin. It seems the mythical creature \u2013 often thought to be a large wildcat or fox \u2013 has caught the public's attention once more thanks to a spate of attacks on livestock and one local farmer. Armed with a video camera and a case of beer, the group head off into the woods but they soon uncover much more than they bargained for, with Sophie falling foul of a mysterious madman who locks her away in an apparent attempt to protect her from some unnamed terror.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/24D4ZDTgEdA002SbstkfE3L8lBW.jpg", "actors": ["Sacha Dhawan (Sam)", "Sadie Pickering (Jane)", "Jonathan Readwin (Dean)", "Stephen Walters (Gavin / Vincent)", "Sol Heras (John)", "Colin Tierney (Father Thomas)", "James Roach (The Creature)", "Benedict Relton (Sophie's Father)", "David Bowen (Father Jacob)", "Holly Messenger (Young Sophie)", "Aaron Ross (Young Gavin)", "Dominic Holmes (Young Vincent)", "Chris Jack (Police Officer)", "Nathan Doyle (Police Officer)", "Holly Weston (Sophie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [239728, 172342, 65322, 92322], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
