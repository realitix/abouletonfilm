In his earlier film, a landmark of cinematic deconstruction, Jacobs re-photographed and manipulated a film fragment from the dawn of cinema, penetrating the image to reach the sublime. In Anaglyph Tom, the artist applies the anaglyph 3-D process to the original footage, engaging the experience of depth perception as the subject of his relentless experimentation and dizzying interventions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hyNL6fAAUonwyBryrLdWCorGq43.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
