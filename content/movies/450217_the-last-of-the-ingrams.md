Unable to pay his debts, Jules is driven from his house when banker Rufus Moore ( Robert McKim ) forecloses on the mortgage. Offered shelter by Mercy Reed ( Margery Wilson ), a woman who in her youth naively sinned and has remained rejected by the community ever since, Jules begins to reform. Climbing his way back to respectability, Jules attends church with Mercy, causing a storm of protest. Moore's wife Agnes urges the mob to violence, and as they attempt to tar and feather Jules and Mercy, Mercy delivers an eloquent speech condemning Moore as her betrayer. The mob then takes Moore as their victim, leaving Jules and Mercy in peace.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["William Desmond (Jules Ingram)", "Margery Wilson (Mercy Reed)", "Robert McKim (Rufus Moore)", "Walt Whitman (Israel Spence)", "Mary Armlyn (Agnes Moore)", "Thelma Salter (Ruth Moore)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
