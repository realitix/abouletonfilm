Director Laurent Pelly's interpretation, which premiered at Glyndebourne in 2008, finds Hansel, Gretel and their family taking shelter in a cardboard box while the witch's stock of goodies lines the shelves of a supermarket.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AuXfHf7d05dPWszSr0SrylUqIwZ.jpg", "actors": ["Jennifer Holloway (Hansel)", "Adriana Ku\u010derov\u00e1 (Gretel)", "Irmgard Vilsmaier (Mother)", "Klaus Kuttler (Father)", "Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke (The Witch)", "Amy Freston (Sandman)", "Malin Christensson (Dew Fairy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
