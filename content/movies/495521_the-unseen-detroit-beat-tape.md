Loosely acting as a prequel to the LA-based All Ears documentary, The Unseen provides rare insights into a scene that has remained distant from the public eye, while giving birth to some of the culture's richest and most influential sounds. The film [provides a] glimpse [into] the hidden and elusive characteristics inherent in a city often depicted in a one-dimensional light.\" - Gus Sutherland", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qcFpF5RxzrlmdZd9YprDEeWfeyj.jpg", "actors": ["Waajeed ()", "Amp Fiddler ()", "Ahk ()", "Hugh Whitaker ()", "House Shoes ()", "Konphlict ()", "Dakim ()", "Illingsworth ()", "Quelle Chris ()", "Nick Speed ()", "Dirtee Curt ()", "Dirtee Curt ()", "Slaughtah ()", "Sterling Toles ()", "Jay Dee aka J Dilla ()", "Baatin ()", "TaRaach ()", "DJ Head ()", "DJ Dez ()", "Rafael Statin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
