Mats Bigert &amp; Lars Bergstr\u00f6m's film \u201cThe Last Supper\u201d focuses on this discrepancy between historical \u201cmeaning\u201d and contemporary use of a tradition that has lost its connection with the past. The main character is the former death row chef Brian Price, who reconstructs one of the 200 final meals that he prepared during his time as inmate in Huntsville State Prison, Texas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5Xd8A0EzvkZRlLjaFrRds577eI4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
