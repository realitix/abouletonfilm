Cranky Kong (and yes, he is cranky), teacher and keeper of the Crystal Coconut, trains DK to be the ruler--and keep him out of trouble. But Cranky can't keep DK out of trouble in this feature-length film, which finds everyone on Congo-Bongo Island battling for the elusive Crystal Coconut (whoever holds the Coconut will receive any wish). Most vehemently after the Coconut is the mercenary King K. Rool (and his reptilian horde of Kremlings) and the pirate Captain Scurvy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aLx00IF9zP1fzXIw6x9UzL0NEwY.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Yearwood (Donkey Kong (voice))", "Andrew Sabiston (Diddy Kong (voice))", "Aron Tager (Cranky Kong (voice))", "Benedict Campbell (King K.
