Orchestras all over the world play his music, but he lives modestly and is dependent upon private patrons. Nagged by his patronizing brothers, spied upon by officials for his republican beliefs and faced by his progressive hearing loss, the composer becomes more and more isolated. Seeman\u2019s poetic film explores the joys, heartbreak and artistic spirit of the great composer as he works on his Ninth Symphony.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xLWxnVbdFLKumaLACOeCfXFGuX1.jpg", "actors": ["Donatas Banionis (Ludwig van Beethoven)", "Stefan Lisewski (Johann van Beethoven)", "Hans Teuscher (Karl van Beethoven)", "Renate Richter (Gr\u00e4fin Josephine Brunsvik)", "Eberhard Esche (Beethovens Sekret\u00e4r)", "Fred Delmare (Johann Nepomuk M\u00e4lzel)", "Katja Paryla (Johanna)", "G\u00fcnter Wolf ()", "Leon Niemczyk (F\u00fcrst Andreas Rasumowski)", "Marita B\u00f6hme (Konzerts\u00e4ngerin S.)", "Rolf Hoppe (Ignaz Schuppanzigh)", "Hannjo Hasse (F\u00fcrst Karl Lichnowski)", "Erika Pelikowsky ()", "G\u00fcnter R\u00fcger ()", "Gerry Wolff ()", "Herwart Grosse ()", "Wolfgang Greese ()", "Gerd Ehlers ()", "Dirk Nawrocki ()", "Christa Gottschalk ()", "Hans-J\u00f6rn Weber ()", "Eva Jirou\u0161kov\u00e1 ()", "Werner Dissel ()", "Wolf Sabo ()", "Angela Brunner ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
