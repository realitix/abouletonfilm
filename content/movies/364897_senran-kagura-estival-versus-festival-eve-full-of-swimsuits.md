Inside is a an invitation to a spa resort.  Yumi declares to the four excited girls that, \"No. This is evil itself,\" points out that they are slacking off too much. Shiki proposes, \"When opinions are divided, it's time for boob rock-paper-scissors!\" and then wins so they all go to the pool.  There, girls from Hanzoo Academy, Homura Crimson Squad, and Hebijo Clandestine Girls' Academy also come, but Asuka says, \"Let's have fun together today\" and they call a temporary truce.  However, a trivial matter sets off a sour quarrel and, at Yumi's suggestion, they settle it with a showdown in the style of the ancient shinobi.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b0fNvqZis0yXai0qlMrYYnzcBvu.jpg", "actors": ["Hitomi Harada (Asuka)", "Kaori Mizuhashi (Yagyu)", "Ryoko Shiraishi (Hikage)", "Yu Kobayashi (Katsurugi)", "Yumi Hara (Yumi)", "Hiromi Hirata (Miyabi)", "Yuu Asakawa (Daidouji)", "Hisako Kanemoto (Murakumo)", "Sayuri Yahagi (Murasaki)", "Suzuko Mimori (Suzune)", "Kaori Ishihara (Yozakura)", "Chiwa Saito (Imu)", "Ayano Yamamoto (Shiki)", "Youko Hikasa (Ryobi)", "Hiromi Igarashi (Minori)", "Mako Sakurai (Ryona)", "Eri Kitamura (Homura)", "Asami Imai (Ikaruga)", "Ai Kayano (Yomi)", "Saori Gotou (Mirai)", "Yuka Iguchi (Hibari)", "Megumi Toyoguchi (Haruka)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
