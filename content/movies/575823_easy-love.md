His way of working shifted between documentary and fiction when he followed seven men and women from Cologne on their search for a balance between emotional security and sensual fulfillment. In four months of shooting those protagonists acted as braver versions of themselves. The camera opened the possibility to pursue their unlived dreams, fears and fantasies and ultimately experiencing them in reality. By shooting in a small team, always on the edge between documentary and fiction, Tamer Jandali created space for intimacy and a new form of cinematic authenticity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eEU2Ej7Iyc6HMsBNqCjYgUPhmCY.jpg", "actors": ["Stella Vivien Dhingra ()", "Sophia Seidenfaden ()", "S\u00f6nke Andersen ()", "Lenika Lukas ()", "Niclas J\u00fcngermann ()", "Pina Felizitas ()", "Amelie Liebst ()", "Sabine Seidenfaden ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
