But in October 2008, less than a decade after Fred Goodwin took over as chief executive, it came within hours of collapsing. RBS later posted the biggest loss in UK corporate history - 24 billion pounds - which damaged the bank's reputation for financial prudence and Scotland's image as a global financial centre. Using previously unbroadcast footage of the bank's top executives and interviews with bank insiders, this documentary tells the compelling story of a national catastrophe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9Gf1D8yjNgh6MBIZhI3mbDxcIaw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
