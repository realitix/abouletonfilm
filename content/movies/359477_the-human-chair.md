These are often letters containing samples of their work for critique. One large envelope contains a letter. The letter-writer does not provide his name. The letter is a confession of crimes. The letter-writer has no family or friends, and claims to be \"ugly beyond description\". He is a chair maker and loves his work and all the chairs he creates, even going so far as to claim some sort of intangible connection to his work.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o2ko9O5yylXIcocunbII8XV0Dyx.jpg", "actors": ["Misa Shimizu (Yoshiko Shinozaki)", "Jun Kunimura (Shoichiro Shimizu)", "Kazuhiro Yamaji (Ningen Isu)", "Yasuko Mitsuura (Tamie)", "Naoko Amihama (Young girl)", "Bang-ho Cho (Young girl)", "Norika Fujiwara (Party Goer)", "Asako Kobayashi (Modern girl)", "Asako Maekawa ()", "Akira Otaka (Yamanaka)", "Youichi Nukumizu (Yoshimura)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
