She hits every note perfectly, and showed that she had what it took to move beyond shorts and into feature films. The problems that Little Miss Marker suffers from are mostly caused by the times. The sound is pretty bad throughout the movie, the levels are all over the place, and the acting from a few characters is completely over the top. Of course, that's all due from the movie being made in 1934. The entire industry was still figuring out the whole sound thing, and this film is definitely a reminder of that. However, Little Miss Marker is still a heartwarming little movie with memorable performances and a solid story."}], "recommandations_id": [141906, 71436, 29879]}
