Mauritius, an important stopover in the eastern slave trade, also came to be known as the \u201cMaroon republic\u201d because of the large number of escaped slaves. This film is a testament to the powers of globalisation and the impact of colonial rule, where a more complex layering of cultural takeovers and integrations have occurred and remain visible today.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
