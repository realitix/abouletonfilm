The girl, Vroni, finds herself pregnant and is forced by her father to marry Poldi Moser, the mayor of the small Swiss town. Moser and Vroni are happy together, and two sons are born to them. Andr\u00e9 returns to the village periodically and finally asks Vroni to go away with him. She refuses, and he writes her an angry note. That evening, Vroni and Andr\u00e9 are involved in a toboggan accident; Vroni is killed outright, and Andr\u00e9 is fatally injured. Moser finds Andr\u00e9's note and goes to him, demanding of the dying man to know which of the boys is in fact Andr\u00e9's child. Thinking to protect his own son, Andr\u00e9 informs Moser that Moser's own son is his (Andr\u00e9's) son. Moser swears vengeance on the child but relents when he realizes that he loves both boys equally.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vb2bnhaOrogHWwkMI5Ub6yVKx0p.jpg", "actors": ["Emil Jannings (Poldi Moser)", "Esther Ralston (Vroni)", "Gary Cooper (Andre Frey)", "Jada Weller (Hans)", "Douglas Haig (Peter)", "Bodil Rosing (Andre's Mother)", "Ann Brody ()", "Paul Guertzman ()", "Leone Lane ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
