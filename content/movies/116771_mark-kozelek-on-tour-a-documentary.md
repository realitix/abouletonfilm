Until now, he has never given filmakers access into his life on the road. Filmed during portions of Mark Kozelek s European and North American tours of 2010 and 2011, this is a rare glimpse into Mark s backstage areas and passenger seat travels. Shot in black and white, this dynamic film captures the fast paced travel of a singer on a solo-acoustic journey, giving viewers an inspirational look at its high points, and also a stark view of its mundane realities. Footage includes an intimate version of 'Katy Song' performed at Sant'Ambrogio Church in Bologna, a mesmerizing 'Half Moon Bay' performed in Switzerland, and a flamenco-flourished Third and Seneca' filmed in a Copenhagen hotel room. . The film s soundtrack includes album tracks, concert recordings, hotel room performances, and a score written and performed by Mark Kozelek", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l1HThPVLYlYp31346SgA96GOg8l.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Kozelek (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
