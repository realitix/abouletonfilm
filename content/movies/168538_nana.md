She's an actress for a soft-core filmmaker and soon is the most popular courtesan in Paris, parlaying this into a house, bought for her by a wealthy banker. She tosses him and takes up with her neighbor, a count of impeccable rectitude, and with the count's impressionable son. The count is soon fetching sticks like a dog and mortgaging his lands to satisfy her whims.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8iWc4jb8xehCBqwPQOl4QxZxYMZ.jpg", "actors": ["Katya Berger (Nana)", "Jean-Pierre Aumont (Count Muffat)", "Yehuda Efroni (Steiner)", "Yehuda Efroni (Sabine)", "Massimo Serato (Faucherie)", "Debra Berger (Satin)", "Shirin Taylor (Zoe)", "Annie Belle (Renn\u00e9e de Ch\u00e9selles)", "Paul M\u00fcller (Xavier)", "Marcus Beresford (Hector Muffat)", "Robert Bridges (Fontan)", "Tom Felleghy (George Mellies)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
