She recalls a childhood filled with moral abuse by her mother, sister and friends, calling her silly offensive names referencing her overweight. When she became an adult, things didn\u2019t really get any better. She\u2019s fired for being fat, she wants a liposuction but the doctor informs her she\u2019s not a candidate due to her overweight, and all her universe seems to be collapsing after a series of unfortunate events. But everything will soon get better thanks to some magical beetles she finds in a Tarot caf\u00e9.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ulPi92RkXYNLQuczyR2PwsdtcI4.jpg", "actors": ["Andrea Ortega-Lee (Ramona)", "Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho (Licenciado del Valle)", "Mar\u00eda Rojo (Marcela)", "Julio Bekhor (Julio)", "Leticia Huijara (Layla)", "Alenka R\u00edos (Juanita)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
