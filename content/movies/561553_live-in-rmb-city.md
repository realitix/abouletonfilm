This video work is part of the acclaimed RMB City series which uses the idea of the Utopian or ideal city as a framework for examining aspects of Chinese and global culture. She has created a Second Life on-line urban community inhabited by the avatars of herself, her friends and fellow artists. It is a realm in which the imagination has free rein but retains the architectural and cultural icons of the real world transformed into a spectacular, shimmering metropolis. Live in RMB City is the culmination of this major series in which the artist in the person of her avatar, China Tracy, takes us on a conducted tour of the virtual city.
