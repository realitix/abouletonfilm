Their covert organization, the self-appointed \"Morality Squad\" has captured Gwar \"member\" The Cuttlefish of Cthulu and put it on trial for obscenity. Gwar ventures forth from their Antarctic stronghold to rescue their compatriot and unleashes untold horrors on America in the name of Freedom of Sexpression.
