She embodies the modest and charming Amina, this sleepwalker who, escaping from her bedroom, becomes another person as she wanders through the night.  This opera by Bellini is a score seemingly written in a daydream, where melody is apparently suspended in time and the heroine's very soul rises to the surface, and where instruments take on transparent tones.  At the same time, Bellini portrays the cruelest of worlds \u2013 our own \u2013 where it is more than difficult for fragility and gentleness to shine past the darker rashness and unfriendliness of the characters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rl3qExmZa48YKRZhvWCrl0C6KyS.jpg", "actors": ["Natalie Dessay ()", "Javier Camarena ()", "Michele Pertusi ()", "Cornelia Oncioiu ()", "Marie-Adeline Henry ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
