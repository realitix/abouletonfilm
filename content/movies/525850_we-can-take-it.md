The CCC was basically put in place to give young men a job, boost their moral and protect the forests of California. Throughout the short we see the various jobs that were being performed and one really does get a great idea of what this mission was all about and why it was so important to Roosevelt.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jNvma49hTru10nyXuNmgPTX9wwc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
