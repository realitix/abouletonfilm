In the first element of the film, a hot-tempered world tennis star loses endorsement contracts when the press outs him even though he claims the report is false. In the second, a talent-less woman struggles to make it in the world of fashion design or the music video business. In the last, an animal activist runs a dog-adoption agency and has an imaginary friend who appears in a St. Bernard suit.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tdhvt0TXlvB46Y0ksV4wtJYgr7V.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Friedrich (Jody George)", "Victor of Aquitaine (George)", "Amy Davis (Sophie)", "Jason Rail (J)", "Michael Fitzpatrick (Jody George's Manager)", "Richard Loomis (Mr. Peepers)", "Izabela Wojcik (Sabrina Mayflower)", "Monte Cazazza (Harrison Sterling)", "Jennifer M.
