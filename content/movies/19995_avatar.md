The state-of-the-art 3D technology draws us in, but it is the vivid weirdness of Cameron's luridly imagined tropical other world that keeps us fascinated. I like this film and I have written many review for <a href=\"https://domywriting.com/\">essay writing service</a>. The special effects are so good here that you don't even notice them. It is eerie how Cameron has made it look and feel like he is just pointing a camera at the action."}], "recommandations_id": [49051, 49026, 14161, 70160], "youtube_key": "5MB3Ea6L-gw"}
