The characters in the grunge-fueled Winnebago include two estranged brothers, a tough vegetarian, a hot lady rocker and the strange Meg. Along the way, lessons are learned and wounds begin healing in Justin MacGregor's directorial debut, which has obvious appeal for Nirvana fans.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6jbiZ4bqjikLyXcz1GBrpgyk3OP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
