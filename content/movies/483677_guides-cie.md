Wiser for its historical organisation, this diverse community of self-employed professionals operates according to two rock-solid pillars: an in-turn work distribution and an emergency fund to support guides injured from work.  Who are these women and men who have sworn allegiance to their passion for the mountains? How do they cope with the hazards that are inherent to their occupation? In other words, what does \"being a guide\" mean in 21st century, and what makes it so remarkable?  Thanks to its numerous moving accounts, this films draws a warm portrait of the guides and takes the audience deep into a very unordinary group of professionals. Undoubtedly a sensitive documentary served with stunning images!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d9hAXiG9lpvdG04qADbWJIMcILZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "XfFyEUs5rTg"}
