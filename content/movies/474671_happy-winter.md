For these people the \u201chuts\u201d are the perfect setting in which to hide behind the memory of a social status that the crisis of recent years has undermined. A family gets into debt to go on a seaside vacation and to look well-off among the bathers, three women sunbathe in order to feel as if they are still young and to become the stars of the summer, while on the same beach a barman thinks about earning as much money as possible to get through the winter. Everyone is waiting for the night of August 15 to play a leading role in the summer Vanity Fair and to keep on pretending that the economic crisis doesn\u2019t exist.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n0Rd98UkKAWcsBtHGLsUcTTnJTu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
