They finished the day by filming coal miners and their families in rental houses. As the filmmakers were leaving, Hobart Ison, the owner of the property, drove up and fired three shots, killing Hugh O'Connor. Elizabeth Barrett, from Kentucky herself, explores why this happened by trying to understand the people and culture of eastern Kentucky.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hjE2jMqRo7moRWYQ14sigwa7Rh.jpg", "actors": ["Hugh O'Connor (Himself)", "Hobart Ison (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
