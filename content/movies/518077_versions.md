Versions highlights that the idea of there being one original image is problematic. Laric acknowledges a non hierarchical form of image creation, one in which bootlegs, copies and remixes sit alongside \u2018originals\u2019.  There is no hierarchy between the sculpture and its various copies they are \u2018same, same but different\u2019", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aytqLkITzvskT4S4vJyX4RhclS8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
