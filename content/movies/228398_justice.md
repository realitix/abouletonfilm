There are those that work there every day (public attorneys, judges, and prosecutors) and those that are merely passing through (the accused). The camera is used as an instrument that sees the social theatre, the structures of power - that is to say, what is, in general, invisible to us. The corridors of the Courts of Justice, the design and layout of the courtroom, the discourse, the codes, postures - all the little visual details and sounds become relevant.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6agUNRnsMe45E4dTgPjd01Pkf4D.jpg", "actors": ["F\u00e1tima Maria Clemente ()", "Carlos Eduardo Rocha ()", "Maria Ignez Kato ()", "Elma Lusitano ()", "Geraldo Luiz Mascarenhas Prado ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
