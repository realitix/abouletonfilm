Several scenes in this slow, elegant film betray a certain dry humor -- a child devouring the last of a bowl of yogurt and then crying; a cow getting its head stuck in a pail; and a woman singing to herself, accompanied by her snoring husband. Other scenes capture the nomads' hardscrabble lives -- drunken herdsmen in the grips of existential despair, growling dogs, and a camel enduring a rather grim septum piercing. By the end of the film, the family pulls up stakes and herds its sundry four-legged beasts -- camels, cattle, goats, dogs, and horses -- to a more fertile plain. This film was screened at the 1999 Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s9Olmb0Tz1S8A1nJLI3MVsFf5gJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [128941, 158292, 145013, 125713], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
