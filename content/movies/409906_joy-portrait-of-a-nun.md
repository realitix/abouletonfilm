A bearded nun. Through an intimate lens, this feature documentary takes us on a journey with Sister Missionary P. Delight, one of the founders of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. In 1979, Mish, as he is affectionately known by his friends, created an Order of gay male nuns to promote a philosophy of promulgating universal joy and expiating guilt. Both he and the Order have come a long way since then. Today, the Sisters are spread out across the globe, and Mish lives in the middle of the woods of the Deep South, in a community of Radical Faeries. JOY! follows Mish and his community over a seven year period, along the way we discover the history of the movement and the highs and lows of his own personal journey.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8lFt67EhcvZhBCUsjSBDJd4RKm2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
