But as this gripping doc reveals, the cost to bring such delicacies to the table is enormous. Bestselling novelist Jonathan Franzen takes a break from the world of fiction to guide us through an all too horrifying reality: tens of millions of protected migratory songbirds are illegally killed every year. Franzen, a longtime bird lover, accompanies young staffers of the Committee Against Bird Slaughter on their expeditions. With police enforcement in Southern Europe practically non-existent, they risk their lives to rescue trapped birds, and confront hostile poachers. It's a topic that proves a cultural flashpoint -- the Cypriot landowners cannot understand why a bunch of Italians can tell them what to do on their land.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zoQaqViO0OvNeF708Fhtdj7XwE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "N_OtCDWjBYM"}
