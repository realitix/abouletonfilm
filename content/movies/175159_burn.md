A house burns from the inside while its occupants focus on the emotional issues of their lives. The inhabitants serve life sentences with no remission in a structure of insecurity - while impending disaster is ignored. An absent minded couple sits calmly reading as fires erupt in their clothing, books and furniture. They nonchalantly swat at the flames with a stoic inattentiveness.  Burn embraces an anti-narrative structure yet intense drama is found in the work. Finally a decisive act is taken leading to the possibility of a miraculous event.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nim1RLXktbRGCRNOBRbWTosdZsT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
