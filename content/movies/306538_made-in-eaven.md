The camera rotates around Jeff Koons\u2019 Rabbit (1986), which is placed in the center of the empty room. The video was transferred to 16 mm film and \u201cis presented on a pedestal, like a sculpture.\u201d The shiny surface of the sculpture reflects the room clearly, but there is no reflection of the camera, after a while the viewer realizes that there was never a bunny in the studio: it is a computer-generated image of Koons' work.  Leckey is an admirer of Koons and has talked about what it is that attracts him to his work: \"I like the idea of something that's almost inhuman in its perfection, like Bunny. It's as if it just appeared in the world, as if Koons just imagined it and it appeared. I always get too involved in the work.\"", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
