Toffee is the story of two girls belonging to polar ends of society brought together by their shared sense of freedom and hopefulness. While one of them is obliged to stay busy all day by helping her father earn a buck, the other chooses to stay busy all day in the absence of her parents. The things they do, the conversations they have and the dreams they harbor are reminiscent of the childlike naivete all of us once had until we grew up. What will come of the girls' ambitions and to what extent are they in control of their own lives? Watch to find out!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p8AjF3j8a9pIigQ91JemIXRlhmH.jpg", "actors": ["Syna Anand (Ritu)", "Sammaera Jaiswal (Taniya)", "Prabjyot Singh (Montu)", "Asha Sharma (Nani)", "Sanjay Tripathi (Ritu\u2019s Father)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "03RrfTCAX5o"}
