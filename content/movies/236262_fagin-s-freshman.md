Momma sends him to bed, where he dreams of venturing out. He sees a sign looking for boys, no experience needed. It's Fagin's school, where he trains boys to steal. The cops raid the place. In the shootout, the phone rings; Fagin answers and passes the message on to a cop: bring home a pound of butter. Blackie dives out a window, gets tangled up in a curtain, and wakes up, tangled in his blanket; he runs downstairs and joins in \"Three Little Kittens.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6Pf9jyardxmSd7LmOwpjjXlLCAm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
