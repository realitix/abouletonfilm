Pansy's father, even though and maybe because she says she's in dreamville, does not share her affection for Dobie. An English essay which almost revolutionizes English instruction, and Dobie's role in a chemistry lab explosion convinces Mr. Hammer he is right. Pansy is sent off broken-hearted to an Eastern school, but with the help of Happy Stella Kolawski's all-girl band, several hundred students and an enraged police force, Dobie secures Pansy's return to Grainbelt.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ill3vrywHJMA3Ftl1JsJYH7pEXu.jpg", "actors": ["Debbie Reynolds (Pansy Hammer)", "Bobby Van (Dobie Gillis)", "Barbara Ruick (Lorna Ellingboe)", "Bob Fosse (Charlie Trask)", "Hanley Stafford (George Hammer)", "Lurene Tuttle (Mrs. Eleanor Hammer)", "Hans Conried (Prof. Pomfritt)", "Charles Lane (Prof. Obispo)", "Archer MacDonald (Harry Dorcas)", "Kathleen Freeman (Stella Kowalski)", "Almira Sessions (Aunt Naomi)", "Willis Bouchey (Dr. Askit)", "Charles Halton (The Dean)", "Percy Helton (Mr. Hammersmith)", "Donald Elson (Advisor (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "oT7Kkuan58U"}
