The story of Alexander's childhood is also the history of an era, the fifties and sixties, and a never solved murder case. Murder goes back to an authentic incident: in 1956, right before Christmas, a policeman was shot in broad daylight in Maassluis during a large-scale evangelistic campaign. The film also plays a failed escape attempt with a herring trawler involved in the turbulent days of May 1940.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/taV2fqQTwWBrGOozvP8RtfOT4ho.jpg", "actors": ["Maarten Heijmans (Alex Goudveyl)", "Bart de Vries (Aaron Oberstein)", "Vivienne van den Assem (Ruth Oberstein)", "Cees Geel (Joost Vroom)", "Esther Way (Yvonne Varekamp)", "Anna Speller (Joanna Overstein)", "Frank Lammers (Inspecteur Douvetrap)", "Peter Drost (Vader Goudveyl)", "Ottolien Boeschoten (Moeder Goudveyl)", "Joost Prinsen (Inspecteur Graswinckel)", "Miryanna van Reeden (Maria Minderhout)", "Kim Pieters (Alice van Essen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
