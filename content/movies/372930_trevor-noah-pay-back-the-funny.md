Recorded Live in Johannesburg at his sold out Lost In Translation Tour, this is his first one-man show since It's My Culture in 2013.  Having sold out theatres everywhere from Auckland to Chicago and replacing Jon Stewart in the hot seat at Comedy Central's The Daily Show in-between, Trevor gives his unique take on the funny side of life in South Africa.
