Collaborating to subdivide a 16mm  film frame into thirds, three  lmmakers present their separately-shot segments simultaneously within one spatial plane. From the interplay of these three points of view emerges a cinematic conversation based on a horizontal compositional logic within the shared frame.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
