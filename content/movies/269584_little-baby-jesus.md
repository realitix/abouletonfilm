He was persuaded by his deeply religious Mexican wife Dolores, who is convinced that only a miracle that might be fulfilled by Prague\u2019s famous Infant Jesus can help their daughter Penelop\u00e9 get pregnant. And the ideal time for this is Christmas. And when Ruda, his friend from Prague, also insists, Jos\u00e9 agrees to return to the places he used to know and to the memories that they bring back \u2013 including his former Prague love. And it becomes evident that the Infant Jesus is not the only one capable of making miracles come true in Prague.
