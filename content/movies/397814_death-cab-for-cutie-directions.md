Every song was directed by a different director and includes 2 bonus videos of unreleased songs. The unprecedented collection came about as the brainchild of otaku-house, the production company owned and run by childhood friends Nick Harmer, bassist for Death Cab for Cutie, and video director Aaron Stewart-Ahn. They saw the opportunity to enlist a variety of talented young artists to each make a short film set to a Death Cab song, without the constraints of the traditional music video- no arbitrary performance footage, the band themselves would not appear in the films. The ultimate goal was to create a series of small films that worked together as both individual pieces of art and as a unified whole.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qOEbB3JEoXgtvKXhfETS2t7FMro.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
