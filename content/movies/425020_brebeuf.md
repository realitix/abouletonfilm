The images in this film arise from a reading of that story - the joining of the sumac and the cross, the blessing gestures, struggles in the field, elliptical scans of stones, and the shimmering of water to summon a glimpse of the flesh boiled from the skin, in fables of the killing. Br\u00e9beuf draws from the dark and storied history of early Western conquest, rediscovering in the harsh, untamed landscape of the North resonances of the violent conflicts between the Jesuits, the Huron, and the Iroquois.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lgoNNmtoVRvoavNIG6RVArtkxbd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
