She tenderly cares for a human skeleton, feeding it, dressing and caressing it, taking it for walks in the dark cabaret of an intimate relationship beyond death. She confronts pain and fear rather than repressing them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rU9zHigo1UTbAubFi4rrMTn38ls.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
