Now, nearly 60 years later, a team of experts examines the original blueprints to determine if these so-called \"Wunderwaffen,\" or \"wonder weapons,\" could have changed the outcome of the war. One of Adolf Hitler's most top secret bombs: The Fritz X grandfather of the modern smart bomb. Prototype testing revealed that the success rate with this radio-guided bomb was over 80 times higher than with conventional free-falling bombs of the time.  In every documented case the destructive power of the Fritz X proved so strong that it would completely rip through any battleship it hit. It would never explode while still inside the ship, but on exiting or in the water.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jt0SAvhCk3jPp9z0BnhDOKulqLc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
