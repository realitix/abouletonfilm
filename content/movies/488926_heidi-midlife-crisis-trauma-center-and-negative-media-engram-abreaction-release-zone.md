The entire work consisted of a fabricated set, a group of partial and full life-size rubber figures, two large backdrop paintings, and a video tape shot entirely on the set. The set was installed at the center of the gallery (Galerie Krinzinger, Vienna)... We were interested in imitating film and television production, and exaggerating the fractured process of film. - Paul McCarthy  In Heidi we toyed with this illusionary nature by treating the doubles and stand-ins for the actors as obvious sculpture, more in the manner of a puppet show than traditional film. - Mike Kelley", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6QFKNO8ANvyha3SkXmRz0UKmLBj.jpg", "actors": ["Paul McCarthy ()", "Mike Kelley ()", "Tim Martin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
