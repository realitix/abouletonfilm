A parody of I Dream of (you know the rest), it brilliantly puts together the start, and end of an episode, in a real-life movie session. Because you KNOW she was REALLY teasing him, and that's what Ginger does. But soon, Paul's wish will come true, and he'll get everything Ginger has to offer!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vGj6r9cEVltWRUdHG7KOj8tdG4d.jpg", "actors": ["Ginger Lynn Allen ()", "Bunny Bleu ()", "Christy Canyon ()", "Laurie Smith ()", "Blake Palmer ((as Skip Laton))", "Paul Thomas ()", "Greg Rome ()", "Lisa De Leeuw ()", "Loni Sanders ()", "David Sanders ()", "James Miles ()", "Jeff Willwright ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
