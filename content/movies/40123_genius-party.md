Atsuko Fukushima\u2019s intro piece is a fantastic abstraction to soak up with the eyes. Masaaki Yuasa, of MIND GAME and CAT SOUP fame, brings his distinctive and deceptively simple graphic style and dream-state logic to the table with \u201cHappy Machine,\u201d his spin on a child\u2019s earliest year. Shinji Kimura\u2019s spookier \u201cDeathtic 4,\u201d meanwhile, seems to tap into the creepier corners of a child\u2019s imagination and open up a toybox full of dark delights. Hideki Futamura\u2019s \u201cLimit Cycle\u201d conjures up a vision of virtual reality, while Yuji Fukuyama\u2019s \"Doorbell\" and \"Baby Blue\" by Shinichiro Watanabe use understated realism for very surreal purposes. And Shoji Kawamori, with \u201cShanghai Dragon,\u201d takes the tropes and conventions of traditional anime out for very fun joyride.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3TCERbJdsS53dEsrwI8q9jJHCT5.jpg", "actors": ["Tomoko Kaneda ()", "Rinko Kikuchi ()", "Lu Ningjuan ()", "Taro Yabe ()", "Yuya Yagira ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [77248, 163551, 113440, 85702], "youtube_key": "4AlCRIoVzLQ"}
