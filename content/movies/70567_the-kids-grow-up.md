With his latest film, Block turns in the other direction, offering an exceptionally moving film about his relationship with his only child, Lucy. THE KIDS GROW UP is a chronicle of Lucy's emotionally-fraught last year at home before leaving for college. Moving fluidly between past, present and the fast-approaching future, Block uses a lifetime of footage to craft not only a loving portrait of a girl transitioning into womanhood, but also an incredibly candid look at modern-day parenting, marriage, and what it means to let go.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xsbVhOqgZ7Wsegh2WdBPT8RnJQJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "u4MvDW7ox6s"}
