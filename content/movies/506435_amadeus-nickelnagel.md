His misfortune is that he falls in love with an independent young athlete, with a modern worldview, who is interested in sports rather than poetry. Amadeus follows the young woman, brings her flowers and gives her one of his poems, at which point she, instead of offering tenderness, challenges him to a boxing match.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
