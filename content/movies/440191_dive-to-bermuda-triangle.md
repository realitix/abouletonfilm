Hundreds of boats and planes have disappeared in the ocean with little or no trace at all. Most of these cases can be explained quite easily by human error or bad weather. But there are some that defy all explanation. Theories abound on these causes: Aliens, massive gas eruptions and freak waves. The documentary reveals that the boats and planes face a real danger in a triangle, but the true threat is often as strange as the wildest theory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p8SV45OkumEDYnx1b4YRxCM0xdU.jpg", "actors": ["Edward Hogg (Lt.
