Being a fat and youngest in his family, he had to go a long way to become what he wanted to be. This is an inspiring film for sports aspirants. Decently made film by an unknown director with good performances in it.\r\n\r\nWhatever it is, or you call it, for me it is a B movie, a fine one. Neal McDonough was the most recognisable face around and he was the backbone of the film after the lead character. The story was told from his perspective and was a bit emotional film than I thought. I don't know this game at all, but I can know what's going on, particularly hard working people to achieve some big in their life.\r\n\r\nIt is not a popular American film among Americans itself, but if you had heard about it and looking for a confident boost, this will do fine. Usually people would say a film like this is a must see, but I think it is worth a watch rather to call it not to be missed.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"}], "recommandations_id": [336049, 550172, 537542, 118621], "youtube_key": "gfmygLVJETU"}
