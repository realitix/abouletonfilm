Luisa (Susu Pecoraro) and her older sister Herminda (Ana Maria Picchio) are streetwalkers in Buenos Aires, but very different in their attitudes. Where Herminda is blithely frank about her job, Luisa is not as casual. On a trip home to bring her mother and little brother to the city (to help care for Herminda's baby), Luisa is viciously gang-raped by her former boyfriend and his cohorts -- but she endures. She eventually gets a job in a massage parlor but is fired when she nixes a client -- and she still endures, back on the streets again. Her sister scorns her, her new boyfriend dumps her, a dear friend is murdered -- yet Luisa never gives in to despair. Popular at the Argentine wickets, this drama has much going for it -- in particular a woman who is a victim but denies it with no problem at all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mXLtbqpJ4ZWbHWMa2lpuWeFOMbI.jpg", "actors": ["Sus\u00fa Pecoraro (Luisa)", "Miguel \u00c1ngel Sol\u00e1 (Rub\u00e9n)", "Julio De Grazia (Cacho)", "Ana Mar\u00eda Picchio (Herminda)", "Cacho Esp\u00edndola (Juli\u00e1n)", "Juan Leyrado (Cholo)", "Arturo Maly (Goon's client)", "Franklin Caicedo (Luisa's Father)", "Chany Mallo (Luisa's Mother)", "Mar\u00eda Fiorentino (N\u00e9lida)", "Willy Lemos (Travesti)", "Gustavo Garz\u00f3n (Taxista)", "M\u00f3nica Villa (Porota)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
