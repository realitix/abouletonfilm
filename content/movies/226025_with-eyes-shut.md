Delia, their grand-daughter, was brought up by them. The three of them live together harmoniously in a cosy atmosphere. At the age of 27, she already has a promising career in a big company.\r Everything is turned upside down with Maga\u2019s sudden death just at the moment when Delia is assigned a very responsible task, the management of a major project which may launch her carer or bring it to an inglorious end. And what\u2019s  more to it, in the opening of the testament it turns out that Maga had expressed the wish that her ashes be dispersed in the Caribbean. Delia is facing a serious dilemma, as in her grand-father\u2019s life there is nothing else now but the accomplishment of his companion\u2019s last wish at a time when Delia can not abandon her professional commitment for a trip to the Caribbean.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8Nn42Xjus8x6Qi3chc46xh1Qkfx.jpg", "actors": ["Carol Sanabria (Delia)", "Paulo Soto (Gast\u00f3n)", "Anabelle Ulloa (Maga)", "Carlos Luis Zamora (Gabo)", "Carlos Porras (Oficial de tr\u00e1nsito)", "C\u00e9sar Maurel ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
