But the ways in which he explores this age-old practice are anything but traditional. He combines drawing with photography, film and large-scale screen-based installations. He is engaged with time as well as line, and with the sculptural potential of two-dimensional images. Other concerns in his art are also strongly contemporary: the city, ideas of public and private, voyeurism, desire and emotional distance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/79vDbUsPeVIH2SWAO8LBbIyhJNW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
