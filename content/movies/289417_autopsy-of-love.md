A desperate man, obsessed by his lost love.  Psychologists, attorneys, youngsters, aged couples, single and married persons, and priests give their opinions on why loving relationships fail.  Certain strange, bitter and disenchanted muses speaking the language of love, sprinkle here and there suggestions for new erotic experiences, dismantling old fashioned models, based on Michel Onfray\u00b4s work \"Th\u00e9orie du corps amoureux: pour une \u00e9rotique solaire\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AhwKAESUMwUOQZ4P10yG6tWYuo2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
