At the beginning of the film we meet a witty, young lesbian called Maggie who sets off on a road trip from Cape Town to Johannesburg to attend Gay Pride there. Against this backdrop of the beautiful, ever-changing African landscapes on her travels, we are introduced to a diverse range of compelling South African lesbians and their stories. Through personal and intimate conversations, we are taken on a journey of sexual discovery, self acceptance and ultimately self pride.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c9Hr0ETDY7ceCgmym0P3LT9AYsz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
