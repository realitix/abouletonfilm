Entre l'appart qu'il partage avec ses potes et le temps qu'il passe avec eux au pub, Liz, sa petite amie, n'a pas beaucoup de place. Elle qui voudrait que Shaun s'engage, ne supporte plus de le voir tra\u00eener. Exc\u00e9d\u00e9e par ses vaines promesses et son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 se consacrer un peu \u00e0 leur couple, Liz d\u00e9cide de rompre. Shaun est d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 tout r\u00e9parer, et tant pis si les zombies d\u00e9ferlent sur Londres, tant pis si la ville devient un v\u00e9ritable enfer.

The acting was good, the plot was fairly well thought out, and it was very funny. It helps if you are a zombie movie(i.e. G. Romero)fan and enjoy British type humor(like the Monty Python troupe), but if you are neither it will not stop you from enjoying this movie. It is a weird mix of several genres(coming of age, buddy movie, comedy, love, horror)but it definitely works on all levels. The main characters(Shaun and Ed)will definitely remind you of some slacker you knew(or know) The facial expressions, dialogue, and general behavior of these two make for some of the best scenes in the movie. There are also some very good make-up effects, and a decent amount of gore. This is definitely one worth owning."}], "recommandations_id": [4638, 107985, 170, 19908], "youtube_key": "CfBewQPFdKE"}
