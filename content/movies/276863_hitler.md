He would like Amar to find employment for himself on his merit rather than use his contacts, but Amar is unable to secure any employment. Then wealthy Daulatram insults Siddhanth, accuses him of using Amar as a ploy to woo his daughter Priya, so that the Sharma family can inherit his wealth. An angered Siddhanth confronts Amar, who grabs a knife and warns Daulatram. Shortly thereafter, the police arrest Amar for killing Daulatram. Siddhant disbelieves him, but Sheila decides to don her black gown and represent her brother-in-law, against the overwhelming evidence that has surfaced against him. It is now up to Sheila to not only defend Amar but also attempt to find out the reason behind Daulatram's death.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Mithun Chakraborty (Jailor Siddhant Kumar Sharma)", "Shilpa Shirodkar (Advocate Sheila S.
