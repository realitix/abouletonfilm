Two men fall in love with each other in an all-male world. As their relationship develops, however, it is no longer their own personal matter, but rather a jarring dissonance in this masculine world. The minorities express their needs, but their expression seems so powerless and fragile in comparison with the society at large. Nevertheless, the yearning for ideals in their tender souls never fades.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
