It was a brilliant idea to make a video as well as an audio recording. Cellists will welcome the chance to study Rostropovich's bowing and fingering techniques, close up and at leisure. And music-lovers will welcome the visuals of the recording location, a French church whose architecture, statues, and flickering candles complement the music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lvx1oPznl2vHL7pL761V95K51Xb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
