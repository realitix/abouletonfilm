The special included songs from Grease and the Totally Hot album as well as some other artists' covers : the Eagles, Bob Seger, Elton John and Buddy Holly. Olivia also performed a parody of the jazz/blues classic Makin' Whoopee with Gene Kelly, changing the lyrics to Makin' Movies and dealing with Olivia's dream of producing a musical.  The show was aired internationally and did very well in the ratings, as did her two previous US television specials on the same network. It is to be noted that Tina Turner's appearance on Olivia's special helped her sign a contract with then Olivia's manager Roger Davies, who ultimately helped her to go back into the spotlight.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/btkfjB87ojxZDuxYdDaMfpcUU3v.jpg", "actors": ["Olivia Newton-John ()", "Gene Kelly ()", "Andy Gibb ()", "Elton John ()", "Tina Turner ()", "Karen Carpenter ()", "Dick Clark ()", "Chantal Contouri ()", "Ted Knight ()", "Cliff Richard ()", "Toni Tennille ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
