That's enough for them. Now they're off to bag themselves a moose, a bear, a fox, a lion, a leopard. It doesn't much matter as long as a fur coat will bag Betty. But neither of them are especially competent at the sport. Koko has to put up with a moose that fires back; while Bimbo suffers the wrath of a lion who multiplies after being shot. And neither hunter accounts for Betty's fickleness or her kind heart.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7vRUzZJF3759KlAuVy2WaqmY4sW.jpg", "actors": ["Ann Little (Betty Boop)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
