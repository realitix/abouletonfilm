Even though the cycle is coming to its end, they inhabitants refuse to leave their land. The landscape of San Rosendo: the mountains, the river, the trees, the roads, the houses and the railway ruins, retains traces of the past and the history of those men. The Noise of Trains portrays a several villagers, mostly old people, that carry out small actions during a day. These characters are defined from their gestures, movements and looks. They are closely related with the place they live in and they are another element of the landscape. This is a film about spaces, atmospheres and distances, where the framings talk about the mood of a place that is disappearing slowly. It has no interviews or voices in off, but the ambient sounds transmit the sensations of loneliness and abandonment that surround to the characters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eDw887saqQI9O538ASjkAdqtqh1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
