Rose Hall, home of Jazz at Lincoln Center for two sold-out shows dedicated to vintage blues. The extraordinary collaboration, billed as Wynton Marsalis &amp; Eric Clapton Play the Blues, paired these musical virtuosos with members of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra as they brought to life a repertoire of songs selected by Clapton and arranged by Marsalis. Reprise Records captures the magic of these unprecedented shows on CD and a CD/DVD combo that both feature selections taken from the two public concerts, as well a special performance for Jazz at Lincoln Center's annual gala.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nsrUf2nmQOFPdtVChGkB8UFSDyN.jpg", "actors": ["Wynton Marsalis ()", "Eric Clapton ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [40403], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
