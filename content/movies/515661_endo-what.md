During that time, many are forced to abandon dreams of having children, to leave careers they love and to watch their personal relationships suffer. They\u2019re regularly told (erroneously) that pregnancy & hysterectomy are cures and that pain is normal or in their heads.  It\u2019s time to break that cycle. It\u2019s time for a normal that doesn\u2019t mean multiple doctors, surgeries, misdiagnoses and years of pain.  The only film of its kind, Endo What? gives you an accurate, up-to-date base of knowledge straight from the experts \u2013 a vital resource missing until now.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9RCQubCw4DQIjVdAnRpTjRuMveN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
