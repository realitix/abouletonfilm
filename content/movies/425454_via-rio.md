The film tumbles through a series of relationships woven around one woman's narration of her parents' marriage. This woman (played by Lilian Mafra) is a fresh and fecund personality who relates the story of her mother's infidelities while sitting naked and pregnant in a garden. Interspersed around this narrative are a number of other scenes which feeds the complex nature of human interaction. Interaction that is sometimes comic, sometimes lonely but, as the very pregnant Mafra indicates, inevitably part of life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mX0fKBKdmkaDOEpSPsc3NjfsOXi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
