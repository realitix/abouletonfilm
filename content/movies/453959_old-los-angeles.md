As always, Elliot is a \"peaceable man\"--until he beats the tar out of those who rile him. The problem with Elliot's more expensive Republic vehicles is that action invariably took a back seat to plot, romance, costumes and decor. Within a year of Old Los Angeles, Elliot started a more austere, less prettified and far superior western series.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lBAX1KiOtiBgMzUyu8PAbH3xbrr.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Elliott (Bill Stockton (as William Elliott))", "John Carroll (Johnny Morrell)", "Catherine McLeod (Marie Marlowe)", "Joseph Schildkraut (Luis Savarin)", "Andy Devine (Sam Bowie)", "Estelita Rodriguez (Estelita Del Rey)", "Virginia Brissac (Se\u00f1ora Del Rey)", "Grant Withers (Marshal Ed Luckner)", "Tito Renaldo (Tonio Del Rey)", "Roy Barcroft (Clyborne)", "Henry Brandon (Larry Stockton)", "Julian Rivero (Diego)", "Earle Hodgins (Horatius P.
