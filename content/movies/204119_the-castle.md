As Josef seeks to make an appointment to see the ruler Herr Klamm inside his inaccessible abode, he becomes enmeshed in abuse from lowly villagers and bureaucrats alike. His endless false starts toward the castle's enigmatic interior are partly offset by a few sexual encounters but nothing alleviates his role as a victim of forces beyond his control.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5PuGOmfFpkcG5HPhjCaIjkjK3Ag.jpg", "actors": ["Carl-Kristian Rundman (Josef K)", "Titta Karakorpi (Frieda)", "Sari M\u00e4llinen (Olga)", "Anna-Leena H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen (Amalia)", "Ulla Koivuranta (Pepi)", "Pirkka-Pekka Petelius (Jeremia)", "Vesa Vierikko (Artur)", "Risto Autio (Barnabas)", "Tuula Nyman (Gardena)", "Erkki Saarela (Majatalon is\u00e4nt\u00e4)", "Christina Indrenius-Zalewski (Herrainhovin em\u00e4nt\u00e4)", "Antti-Einari Halonen (Herrainhovin is\u00e4nt\u00e4)", "Seppo Wallin (Kunnanjohtaja)", "Elina Salo (Mizzi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
