Today you can choose if you want to keep it or not.\u201c The results of prenatal screening can present would-be parents with a very difficult dilemma. Should a physically or mentally disabled child be allowed to live \u2013 or not be brought into the world at all? Who gets to decide what is normal and worthy of life? The filmic essay DIE DRITTE OPTION puts a new perspective on a highly controversial topic: while we listen to the statements of doctors, those who carry out prenatal screenings and the disturbing experiences of the couples affected, the visual level places the topic in a much wider socio-political context. Director Thomas F\u00fcrhapter\u2019s debut film offers fascinating visual and acoustic impressions that tackle the core questions of birth, death, ethics and questions how far we should go when it comes to optimising our lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Apn8OLc0byo0Lht1oFyFysgntwj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
