He drives a VW Beetle, lives on a farm and donates 70% of his earnings to charity. He is considered one of the most charismatic politicians in Latin America. Old and young believe in him thanks to his humble lifestyle and his unconventional manners, especially where political protocol is concerned. Now in his 80s, Mujica, a former guerrilla fighter who was imprisoned for 13 years for fighting with the Tupamaros against the dictatorial regime in Uruguay in the 1970s, believes in democracy, socialism, women\u2019s rights and the legalization of cannabis. An inspiration to thousands of people all over the world, he grows flowers in his garden and defines life as his religion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cWurU4pVZ0EzwQpAWEHNkH6u7de.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
