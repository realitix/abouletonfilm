The protagonist, a university student name Jana (Theodora Remundov\u00c3\u00a1) who is trying to solve a troubled relationship with a married man, takes her mother's place on the election commission. In the meantime the mother (Iva Janzurov\u00c3\u00a1) is going through her own small domestic crisis with her husband (Leos Suchar\u00c3\u00adpa).
