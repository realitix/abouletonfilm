They believe the power rings they purchase from a shady pawnshop salesman are their one shot at becoming somebody. 'Thunder' and 'Hurricane,' Rufus and Silas' alter egos, quickly set off for superhero-dom only to fail at their several heroic attempts. However, their fate seems to change when they meet a self-proclaimed, retired superhero who offers to train them to become the heroes they long to be. It isn't long until their newly acquired training is put to the test when they find themselves mixed up in a crime spree that plagues the town. Through turmoil, romance, deception, and imprisonment, Rufus and Silas are in for the ride of their lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hgQRJIV1s8NjWxu6D08eAjIRaGF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
