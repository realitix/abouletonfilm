For seventeen years, she worked as a maidservant for Johann Jakob Tschudi, a physician. Tschudi reported her for having put needles in the bread and milk of one of his daughters, apparently through supernatural means. G\u00f6ldi at first escaped arrest, but the authorities of the Canton of Glarus advertised a reward for her capture in the Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung on February 9, 1782. G\u00f6ldi was arrested and under torture, admitted to entering in a pact with the Devil, who had appeared to her as a black dog. She withdrew her confession after the torture ended, but was sentenced on June 18, 1782 to execution by decapitation. The charges were officially of \"poisoning\" rather than witchcraft, even though the law at the time did not impose the death penalty for non-lethal poisoning.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4PBnmoLrh85yESKf0M0PiJvdm53.jpg", "actors": ["Cornelia Kempers (Anna Goeldin)", "Luca Kurt (Anne-Miggeli Tschudi)", "R\u00fcdiger Vogler (Dr. Tschudi)", "Ursula Andermatt (Frau Tschudi)", "Dominique Horwitz (Kubli)", "Anne-Marie Blanc (Frau Zwicky)", "Pinkas Braun (Pfarrer Cameraius)", "Annamirl Bierbichler (Katharina)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
