The fight marks Pacquiao's second defense of the 147-pound title he won from Miguel Cotto in 2009. The first came against Josh Clottey in March 2010, after which Pacquiao moved up and beat Antonio Margarito for a vacant super welterweight title last November. That victory made Pacquiao the first boxer to capture world championships in eight different weight classes (from 112 to 154).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4cdfabG1TxQXM6ypOf4B6em5bvk.jpg", "actors": ["Manny Pacquiao (himself)", "Freddie Roach (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "CrsBRMOxhDw"}
