They loan money from a pimp and begin casting the girls. When filming starts they find out that sex in front of the camera is hard work. Also you should know how to work a video camera. Frustration, relationship problems and cabin fever culminate in a dope induced garden orgy. But is it a film?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jeEcfhl1aeVDfnDhmz5urL3em20.jpg", "actors": ["Raimund Wallisch (Johann)", "Michael Ostrowski (Max)", "Pia Hierzegger (Mao)", "Iva Lukic (Mara)", "Sophia Laggner (Martha)", "Georg Friedrich (Schorsch)", "Mike Supancic (Reini)", "Brigitte Kren (Anita)", "Elisabeth Holzmeister (Julia)", "Helmut K\u00f6pping (Gerhard)", "Faris Rahoma (Zejlko)", "August Schm\u00f6lzer (Zuh\u00e4lter)", "Christoph Grissemann (Grissemann)", "Monika Klengel (Sabine)", "Andreas Kiendl (Alfred)", "Christine Hartenthaler (Renate / P\u00e4dagstudentin)", "Martina Zinner (Luisa)", "Rupert L.
