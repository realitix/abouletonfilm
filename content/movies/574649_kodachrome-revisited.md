I then hand processed the film in a very sloppy manner. I never mounted the film into slides I simply took the 35mm strips of film and spliced them together. Some of the rolls used in this film were shot by random people I sent a roll of film to that they shot and sent back to me.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6owuDM8bDAJi8rStpkH41amCcBZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
