The tension among the trio of women escalates as Evie prepares for a pull-out-all-the-stops television special commemorating her past career glories, which include sundry disaster movies and TV variety shows. What Evie doesn't know is that the na\u00efve-seeming Varla has a debt to settle for her deceased mom, and will stop at nothing to seek vengeance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lFrZNE2ekEL7y9RxtaxnDjq4Ca1.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Plotnick (Evie)", "Miss Coco Peru (Coco Peru)", "Jeffery Roberson (Varla)", "Ron Mathews (Stevie)", "Jeffery Roberson (Marla)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
