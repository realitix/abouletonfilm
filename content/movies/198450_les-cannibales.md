It was commissioned by the Portuguese master of style, director Manoel de Oliveira from composer Jo\u00e3o Paes. Musically, it ranges from 19th-century romanticism to popular, modernist and even \"post-modernist\" styles. In the initially tame story, a host-narrator tells the story of a wedding between the two lovebirds: Viscount d'Aveleda and the beautiful Marguerite. However, what happens in the bridal chamber is incredibly bizarre. The events after that are even stranger (the film out-does even Luis Bu\u00f1uel in that department), and the wedding guests and family indulge in cannibalism, among other perversions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wuyEXxtFRiAE8Lr0LUTNqrhjjrp.jpg", "actors": ["Lu\u00eds Miguel Cintra (Viscount d'Aveleda)", "Leonor Silveira (Margarida)", "Diogo D\u00f3ria (Don Jo\u00e3o)", "Oliveira Lopes (The Presenter (lago))", "Pedro T. da Silva (Niccolo)", "Joel Costa (Urbano Solar)", "Rog\u00e9rio Samora (Peralta)", "Rog\u00e9rio Vieira (The Magistrate)", "Ant\u00f3nio Loja Neves (The Baron)", "Lu\u00eds Madureira ()", "Teresa C\u00f4rte-Real ()", "Jos\u00e9 Manuel Mendes ()", "C\u00e2ndido Ferreira ()", "Gl\u00f3ria de Matos (Gl\u00f3ria Matos)", "Sofia Alves (Convidada do Conde)", "Filomena Amaro (Margarida (singing voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [110789], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
