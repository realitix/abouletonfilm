That is not really uncommon with Ice-T he is one of those guys that is in a no budget film for one scene and still gets his name (often face as well) on the poster so at least he's in this for a number of scenes.\r\n\r\nAnyhow enough about me obsessing about Ice-T, the actual movie is pretty bland. The acting is definitly not the best, Ice-T is probably the best actor in it, so that should tell you everything really.\r\n\r\nThe plot is decent enough but it's held back by a slow pace (it takes 40 minutes until we 'find out' it's about vampires) and overall lack in quality on most levels, some really long car driving and talking scenes with some of the most obvious greenscreened backgrounds in recent history and CGI that the Asylum would be embarassed about.\r\n\r\nIt could have been remedeed a bit if they made it a bit more tongue in cheek."}], "recommandations_id": [467839, 93950, 293901, 442824], "youtube_key": "JoChqwSLcmA"}
