It gives a reality check to the problem, and a validation to the Cystic Fibrosis sufferers. The number of positive reactions to the film from those afflicted with Cystic Fibrosis , attests to the emotional value as such. The humor used to substantiate the suffering of the patients gives such a film a great human touch. Hail to the producers, and especially a true memorial for one of them, Robert Schmidt, who so tragically passed away last year after filming was finished. I certainly hope that any income from this film will be donated to research for Cystic Fibrosis, and the film itself could be used to further promote outreach for this purpose.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xqyKh7wuE3I1MdxdQw5M1bGeboP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
