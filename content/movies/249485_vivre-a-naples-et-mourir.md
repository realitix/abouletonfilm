Our meeting took place on the terrace of the Hotel Majestic, in the midst of excitement of the Cannes festival life, a few days after the screening of Nel Regno di Napoli and in the presence of the photographer Jean-Claude Moireau.  Vivre \u00e0 Naples et mourir is the audio capture of that informal meeting that happened on 20 May 1978 and which is, as per director's wish, more like a casual conversation than an interview in the strict sense of the term (a set of questions and answers).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/waUuqjvH3Jz44HpSlC3ZwW2jAhF.jpg", "actors": ["Werner Schroeter (Himself)", "Jean-Claude Moireau (Himself)", "G\u00e9rard Courant (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
