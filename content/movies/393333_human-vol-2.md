This sensitive experience is an introspection into whom we are today as a community but also and most importantly as an individual. Through wars, inequalities, discriminations, HUMAN confronts us with the realities and the diversity of our human conditions. Beyond this darker side, testimonies show the empathy and the solidarities which we are capable of. All these contradictions are ours and HUMAN leads us to reflect about the future we wish to give to people and the planet today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k95QaNm5DdLtQ7HLVzZGRfo8NM1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
