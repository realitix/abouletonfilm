The craftsmen are shown who make the ball and the bat\u2013that \u2018fourth straight stick\u2019 with which the batsmen defend \u2018the other three\u2019. The craftsmen are shown who play the game, from W. G. Grace in the \u2018nets\u2019 to D. G. Bradman and Denis Compton in the thread of the \u2018Test\u2019. The history of the game is epitomized in the Long Room shots at Lord\u2019s and from there the camera moves to the village green; to the London side- street where the urchins play on a \u2018bumping pitch\u2019; to South Africa, and India, where in the \u2018blinding light\u2019 there is often \u2018an hour to play and the last man in.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Ralph Richardson (Narrator(voice))", "John Arlott (Narrator(voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
