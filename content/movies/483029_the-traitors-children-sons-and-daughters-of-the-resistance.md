In his film, \"The Traitors' Children\", Christian Weisenborn presents harrowing encounters with the children of the executed conspirators, while also taking a look at his own family history. His parents belonged to a group of anti-fascists, which the Gestapo called the \"Rote Kapelle\" (the red chapel). Weisenborn's parents survived, but 52 of their friends were hanged in Pl\u00f6tzensee in 1942/43. Weisenborn also interviewed their sons and daughters.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Christian Weisenborn (Director)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
