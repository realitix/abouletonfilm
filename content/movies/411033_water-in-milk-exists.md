The film contains quotations from the artist's children\r books, austere dialogues on string theory, animations, as well as a lot of carnal action. A\r multitude of events accompany the launch of the film, mingling porn and art as two of\r today's most lucrative industries.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eLakYFJnOOKRhtPtCSAta3BXHkq.jpg", "actors": ["Christina Ewald (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
