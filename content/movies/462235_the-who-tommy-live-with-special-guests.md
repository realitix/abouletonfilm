It was the 20th anniversary of Tommy, which seemed like a good excuse to book a bunch of stadiums and play the album along with a healthy dose of Who classics, aided by a mere 12 other musicians. This is The Who live at the Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles, 24 August 1989.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d1DoqVqsZpmT1K6PvqykEGnM310.jpg", "actors": ["Pete Townshend (Himself)", "John Entwistle (Himself)", "Roger Daltrey (Himself)", "Phil Collins (Himself)", "Billy Idol (Himself)", "Elton John (Himself)", "Steve Winwood (Himself)", "Patti LaBelle (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
