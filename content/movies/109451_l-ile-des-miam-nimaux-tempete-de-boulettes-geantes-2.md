The story might not be quite as straightforward as the first _Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs_, but it ups the fantastical quality, making me appreciate it even more. Such a great hangover film.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"}], "recommandations_id": [22794, 172385, 77950, 15512], "youtube_key": "3QCJTbHU60U"}
