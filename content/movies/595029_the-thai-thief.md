Thailand allowed troops to deliver weapons and gold via train to Central Asia. This booty-filled train led to an idea for Khom, a well-known thief to stage a brilliant crime. Meanwhile, Toe, the leader of the movement against the troops has a plan to stop the train, but the situation turns upside-down, when Khom and Toe have to help a secret agent from being captured by Japanese troops.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iSwFNHwqnPxmrjRcqN5LWu4SmpQ.jpg", "actors": ["Todsaporn Rottakij (Khom)", "Than Thanakorn (Yai Thaareu)", "Suthep Pongam (Toe)", "Kohtee Aramboy (Go (as Koti Arambawy))", "Sahatchai 'Stop' Chumrum (Laem 18 Uan)", "Sara Legge (Seena)", "Amthida Ngoencharoen (Patty)", "Somlek Sakdikul (General Sant)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
