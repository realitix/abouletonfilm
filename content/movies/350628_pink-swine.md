Described as \"an anti-art dada collage film,\" this free-form short presents cut-out images animated across old photos (a style picked up by Terry Gilliam a few years later) and found objects that dance to the beat of the rock-and-roll soundtrack. He produced this short during a summer spent with Joseph Cornell and Jordan edited the film entirely in camera, making the upbeat visual rhythm of this delightful lark even more impressive. \u2013Sean Axmaker", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vS4IKzHxsAuRIZSP3jg0b0ML4uj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
