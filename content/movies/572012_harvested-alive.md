He never imagined that he would spend another 10 years investigating how Chinese doctors take innocent lives.  95% of his evidence comes directly from China. His sources are Chinese doctors, judges, legislators, military officials, government officials, the media, and hospital websites. His research reveals an inconceivable truth \u2013 China\u2019s hospitals, judiciary, and military worked together under the authority of the previous Chinese president Jiang Zemin to mercilessly slaughter a large number of Falun Gong practitioners through the harvesting of their organs.  Today in a time of peace, it is difficult for people to believe that such a large-scale massacre has been silently taking place in China. But the truth shows that this frenzied killing machine, driven by huge profits, is still running rampant in society.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uw1tE7xQbmEEGu9hS2WKyDjqDsK.jpg", "actors": ["Zhiyuan Wang (Himself)", "Rich Crankshaw (Narrator)", "Zenon Dolnyckyj (Voice Over)", "Vanessa Rios Gomez (Voice Over)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "CBtjRJXEzIQ"}
