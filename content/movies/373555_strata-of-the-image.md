We focus our view on the human-landscape relationship, facing it in two temporal dimensions: the geological and human.  This definition synthesize well the will of the project: \"The landscape are layers of time condensed into an image\". We seek to merge different temporal layers into a single image, proposing two exploration lines: emphasize the ephemeral and fleeting passage of man over the territory; and invite to a leisurely contemplation showing the poetry and mystery of the movements of landscape.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/41uvNexipl0ZCQmj3ppwpceF1nm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
