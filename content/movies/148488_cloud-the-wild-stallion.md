In 1995, while filming wild horses in the mountains of Montana, Ginger Kathrens discovered a striking, almost pure white colt just hours after his birth. Kathrens named him Cloud. She feared that his distinctive coat would make him an obvious target for mountain lions; but he survived and Kathrens continued to follow him in his adventures. In Cloud: Wild Stallion of the Rockies this wild horse developed from a bumbling, unsteady colt into an adventurous, defiant youth.  In Cloud\u2019s Legacy: The Wild Stallion Returns, Cloud is now a band stallion with a mare and her children, a yearling and a foal. Meanwhile, Cloud\u2019s own child, which has a telltale golden coat, lives with another herd and will never know him as his father.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rV9fWltjdTPDhpSb857F1aC4ew1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
