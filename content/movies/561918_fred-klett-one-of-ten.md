His comedy is G-rated and focused to appeal to families with members of all ages since much of his material is taken from his experiences growing up in a large Christian family. As a mainstream performer, his brand of humor is rare and refreshing and is rooted in his faith in Christ and belief in the Holy Scriptures.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/52YLMB5hCDrsoBZEQI9709kGGmq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
