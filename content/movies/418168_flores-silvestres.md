The camera observes nature and physical spaces and provides a special density to them, as if they were silent partners in her mourning for something she lost forever. Her friendship with a young man from the area creates an interest triggered by its ambiguity: is there s sexual tension, or rather she sees in him a memory of what she lost? Is there an attraction or does the young man stand for the ghost of that past that still exists in Marta\u2019s everyday life? Flores silvestres leaves these matters unresolved, because they may not have a clear answer. As if, in the end, pain blurs everything out.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lqwF9KTpQPLJq23NArDCgLK6AA5.jpg", "actors": ["Carolina Politi (Marta)", "Adri\u00e1n Carre\u00f3n (Germ\u00e1n)", "Mar\u00eda Teresa Garagarza (\u00c9rica)", "David Hevia (Adolfo)", "Daniela Castillo (Cintia)", "Xel-Ha Robles (Alina)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "f_7GC1MaJVk"}
