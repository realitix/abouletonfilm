The camera searches amongst the craggy rocks and ruined buildings of a bleak and windswept snowscape, a Geiger counter chatters ominously in the background. The sky is overcast at first but gradually clears to reveal a sky of unnatural cobalt blue.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9KCrMoLykyNFiT7VuXXTzbPpAmM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
