The story proper is carried by Robert Wilcox and Nan Grey, cast as a pair of mismatched lovers who share a common interest in horse racing. Hero and heroine get mixed up in a shady get-rich-quick scheme, which threatens to turns disastrous but which ends up solving everyone's problems.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cEYNXg929Ps1AJqNRAE3jHwkRVR.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Wilcox (Danny Farrell)", "Nan Grey (Laurie Andrews)", "Jimmy Savo (Stuffy)", "Frank Jenks (Freddie)", "William Lundigan (Stanley Shaw)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
