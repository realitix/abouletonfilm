Slasher publicly abducts a series of reality TV stars, while the media and general public in turn begin to question if society is better off without them. A biting, social satire about reality TV and the glorification of people who are famous for simply being famous, \"L.A. Slasher\" explores why it has become acceptable and even admirable for people to become influential and wealthy based on no merit or talent - purely through notoriety achieved through shameful behavior.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iaoJ7nJ8ZV6g3f8wLQQ8tWCYqKS.jpg", "actors": ["Andy Dick (The Slasher (voice))", "Mischa Barton (The Actress)", "Eric Roberts (The Mayor)", "Abigail Wright (The Reporter)", "Dave Bautista (The Drug Dealer #1)", "Danny Trejo (The Drug Dealer #2)", "Marisa Lauren (The Stripper)", "Brooke Hogan (The Reality Star)", "Drake Bell (The Pop Star)", "Tori Black (The Teen Mom)", "Carlee Baker (Scream Queen)", "Barbara Nedelj\u00e1kov\u00e1 (Scream Queen)", "Ashlynn Yennie (Scream Queen)", "Frank Collison (Killers Anonymous Leader)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [90164, 133535, 233734, 30385], "youtube_key": "CzWs3YO3Avo"}
