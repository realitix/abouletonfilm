Several events convinced Marion that God was leading her to a cure for Craig and that the get-well cards he was receiving had the power to keep him alive, so she launched a worldwide campaign to break the Guinness record for receiving the most get-well cards. At the time, the world record seemed an impossible 1,000,265, but Craig received over 350 million cards from all over the world. Against the advice of her doctors, Marion followed one of those cards to America for Craig's miraculous cure.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m4mOoeZkcuXH4HEYHgbxCZPmV8p.jpg", "actors": ["Kirk Cameron (Josh)", "Karin Konoval (Editor)", "Catherine Oxenberg (Marion Shergold)", "Thomas Brodie-Sangster (Craig Shergold)", "Peter Wingfield (Ernie Shergold)", "Jeremy Guilbaut (Steve Shergold)", "Jennifer Carmichael (Sharon Shergold)", "Sean Campbell (Coach)", "Bernard Cuffling (Pediatrician)", "Chang Tseng (Chinese Pharmacist)", "Deni DeLory (Receptionist Queen Mary's)", "Michael Dobson (Dr. Belling)", "Gwenda Lorenzetti (Royal Marsden Nurse)", "Duncan Fraser (Dr. Farley Middleton)", "Anna Cummer (Nurse Theresa)", "Brenda Crichlow (Doreen)", "Jodelle Ferland (Annie)", "Ryan Robbins (Reggie)", "Gina Chiarelli (Radiographer)", "Richard Thomas (Dr. Neal Kassell)", "Rick Tae (Dr. Kassell's Assistant)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
