As the entire project (background art and hundreds of frames worth of actual animation) was undertaken by a single person, the piece was only twelve and a half minutes long. To this end, Johnson opted to present it in a kind of \"next time\" episode trailer format, evoking the feel of a teaser for a Doctor Who animation if one had been produced in Japan during the peak of the country's economic boom.  The film was released in June 2011 after four years in development, but was taken down shortly after following Johnson's hiring by the BBC and 2entertain to work on restoring the lost 1960s episodes. Despite his pleas, he took down all of his Who work, including Jikuu Bouken...although it was quickly mirrored by other accounts.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lUIbBLYvTxmXmBLM2ZnC4jBcxbj.jpg", "actors": ["Jon Pertwee (The Doctor (archive footage))", "Nicholas Courtney (Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (archive footage))", "Roger Delgado (The Master (archive footage))", "Anthony Ainley (The Master (archive footage))", "Terry Molloy (Davros (archive footage))", "Gabriel Woolf (Sutekh the Destroyer (archive footage))", "Sachika Souno (Tomo Kajiura (archive footage))", "Paul Johnson (Daleks/Cybermen (archive footage))", "Phillip Sacramento (US General (archive footage))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "kt3qZYUPi2Y"}
