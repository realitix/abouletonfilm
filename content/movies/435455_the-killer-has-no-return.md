He goes from Hong Kong to Malaysia to kill several people who know he's coming, so they have their own killer on his trail. Hei also has personal business: to deliver a letter his father wrote years before to a mysterious lover. In Kuala Lumpur, Hei meets Jenny, a lively and outgoing barmaid, who draws him out. He discovers that he has feelings for her, and reflecting on his father's love life, Hei takes stock. Can he quit the killing and be with Jenny, or will his hunter force a final showdown?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cY1SxzcCQ5qnolHbMV00HAP8xCv.jpg", "actors": ["Wong Hei (Dung Jan Wa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
