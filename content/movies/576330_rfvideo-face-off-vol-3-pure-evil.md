Two of wrestling\u2019s most controversial characters, both in front and behind of the camera, sat down together to record a priceless experience that will have wrestling fans going crazy. And these guys know crazy!  Raven conducted the interview and came across like an old pro as he pulled stuff out of Sullivan that we had never heard before. It was if we were a fly on the wall in a wrestling locker room, watching two wrestlers talking about the business and completely ignoring the camera. Anyone who has heard Raven or Sullivan knows that this disc is chok-full of great stories as these literally have done it all and seen it all.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Scott Anthony Levy (Himself)", "Kevin Sullivan (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
