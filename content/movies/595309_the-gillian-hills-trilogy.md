In her peripheral roles in Kubrick\u2019s and Antonioni\u2019s films\u2014which became iconic moments for the films she is invisible in plain sight, barely even credited. In Edmond T. Gr\u00e9ville\u2019s lurid Beat Girl, she plays the title r\u00f4le and ironically enjoys not only name recognition but vastly greater agency.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
