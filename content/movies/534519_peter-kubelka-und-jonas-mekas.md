These films are designed in such a way that the camera films a frontal view of the apparently motionless face, and a touch-a caress of the hair, a kiss, a hug-demonstrates the artist\u00b4s relationship with the subject being portrayed, who react in various ways, whether through a lightening of facial expression, a smile or intensified squinting. This matter of involvement represents the specific nature of this series of portrait films, ensuring Kubelka an outstanding position in the field of avant-garde film.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
