Micaela, Jos\u00e9's Mother, and M\u00f6rd (Death) are played by the same dancer. The action is reduced to a single act in 13 scenes. The love scenes are played to a minimum and the working women's fight is adjourned to the last scene [and cut from some DVD editions] that concentrates all the pathos announced throughout by the eerie music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7DR4ajgghHOo4e4g3TWiVFQFYIT.jpg", "actors": ["Ana Laguna (Carmen)", "Marc Hwang (Don Jose)", "Yvan Auzely (Escamillo)", "Pompea Santoro (Micaela / Mother/M\u00f6rd)", "George Elkin (Officer)", "Boaz D Cohen (Gypsy)", "Vanessa de Ligni\u00e8re ()", "Monica Mengarelli ()", "Philippe Blanchard ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
