In this uneven though at times compelling drama, he examines the conflict involved in a forbidden love. While the war is in full swing, a young German solder is assigned to a unit in charge of deporting Jews to the death camps. He falls in love with one of the Jewish women being deported, an impossible situation which he knows has no easy solution, if any. Alternately philosophical and at the end, at least, quite powerful, this film may still be too downbeat for most general audiences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zk84D3F5ttd5ArtHogDFnKNMBX9.jpg", "actors": ["Sascha Kruscharska (Ruth)", "J\u00fcrgen Frohriep (Unteroffizier Walter)", "Erik S.
