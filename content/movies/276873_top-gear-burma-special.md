On their way to the river they almost bring down Burma\u2019s power supply, encounter the world\u2019s least relaxing truck stop, race around the streets of a deserted capital, saddle up a trio of unhelpful horses and attend a completely deranged party.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p2dKevwl0U4BDWvydBPht8lSYO7.jpg", "actors": ["Jeremy Clarkson (Himself)", "Richard Hammond (Himself)", "James May (Himself)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "Anthoney Oates", "content": "Another classic Top Gear Special, 3 blokes arsing around Burma in 3 knackered old trucks, they get up too there usual tricks while trying to get to the river Kwai and end up at the river Kok....and then they have to build a bridge out of bamboo then take all 3 trucks across."}], "recommandations_id": [424846, 293766, 436511, 424847], "youtube_key": "CWIuE_KmwUM"}
