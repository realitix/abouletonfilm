Detective Haffigan investigates a mysterious singing bone, a talisman endowed with dangerous powers, and chased after by a coterie of second-rate outlaws. The bone turns out to be in possession of Mithridate, a seductive actor with a gorilla\u2019s right arm. Haffigan expresses romantic interest in the charming comedian, but he rebuffs her, instead setting his sights on Eleonore, a cashier at the Bank of Permanent Fog, who promises to liberate him from the bone\u2019s curse.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ahOz8eDlzvHUGpKKJdKooB4Yo7M.jpg", "actors": ["Michel Faubert (Le conteur)", "Johanna Nutter (Haffigan)", "\u00c9tienne Pilon (Mithridate le D\u00e9peupleur)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
