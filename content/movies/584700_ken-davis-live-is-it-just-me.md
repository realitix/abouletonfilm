One of America\u2019s favorite speakers, Ken offers up a brilliant performance that pays tribute to veterans, explores the differences between men and women, and ponders the question\u2026 Is it Just Me?  Appearing at a beautifully-restored Vaudeville theater in Sheboygan, Ken also shares his disastrous adventure with snow-boarding, his short-lived experiment with weightlifting, and his painful encounter with a nose-hair clipper. His keen sense of comic timing is mixed with a side-splitting dose of physical humor, and the result is a memorable hour of laughter for all ages. No, Ken, it\u2019s not just you \u2013 we\u2019re all a little strange. But thanks for reminding us that we are loved in spite of our shortcomings \u2013 and thanks for pointing us to the source of true joy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1bDKd8y7Odg7Nfvf3EGA5uCN30W.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
