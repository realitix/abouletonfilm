Directed by Matti Kassila, one of Finland's premiere filmmakers, Eiokuu was adapted from a novel by F. Sillipaa. Simply put, the story concerns the decline and fall of a once-proud family, thanks to the alcoholism of its paterfamilias. Toivo Makela delivers a powerfully effective performance as the inebriated protagonist, avoiding the usual \"drunken\" cliches. The overlong running time, coupled with the downbeat nature of the subject, limited the film's worldwide appeal.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1wZhl32rHxX2MlE0Rm6nbd4n0o.jpg", "actors": ["Toivo M\u00e4kel\u00e4 (Viktor)", "Emma V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen (Saimi)", "Rauni Luoma (Maija)", "Rauni Ik\u00e4heimo (Iita)", "Heikki Savolainen (Mauno)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
