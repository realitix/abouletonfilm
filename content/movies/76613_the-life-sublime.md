A trip that should have remained a family mystery. The South and his grandfather open up a fascinating new world, a space in which a personal memory that immortalizes \u00abEl Cuco\u00bb can be created. A tribute by a grandson to the lost generation of the Franco dictatorship era, one which was not able to fulfill its dreams. A quest for the myth, and the sublime. A new writing of family history. A film that deals with the issue of borders. Borders between North and South, imagination and reality, present and past, grandfathers and grandsons, Spain and America, madness and lucidity", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yEU8OlOJQoX8uVEEVvfLRlcDLm0.jpg", "actors": ["Victor J.
