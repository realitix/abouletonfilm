The less is more approach has gone, thus there is very little suspense, and in place is a gigantic back story for the killer. The characterisation of the girls, some acted by some very capable actresses, is practically non existent, so very little emotional heft to draw you into a state of caring for them. There's some good gore on show, but since tonally the pic is all over the place, it's never once scary or ironically funny.\r\n\r\nA poor show all round. 3/10"}], "recommandations_id": [28739, 8617, 12212, 26688], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
