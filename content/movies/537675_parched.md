One of them is taking a genial young man to his unforeseen future; he would marry his beloved; have a son; become a brilliant doctor; do his duty and save the live of enemies of the communist regime; get a 20-years sentence for that. Prison would turn out to be an unbearable nightmare; his wife would eventually give in to the tortures of the authorities and seek divorce; this would mean no one to visit him in prison. 15 years without any news about his child, only a snapshot of his family on which the tree of them are smiling and happy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mV4H3mmKGb1eB6wqT7NxIthIlp9.jpg", "actors": ["Paraskeva Djukelova (Kalina)", "Deyan Donkov (Inspector Metodi Stoev)", "Stefan Valdobrev (Enriko)", "Iossif Surchadzhiev (Anarchist)", "Nikolai Urumov (Nachalnikat na lagera)", "Tzvetana Maneva (The Mother)", "Yordan Bikov (Chovechniyat agent)", "Valeri Yordanov (Starshina v lagera)", "Mario Krastev (Kofti)", "Vasil Banov (Samozhertveniyat)", "Svetozar Nedelchev (Generalat)", "Katerina Goranova ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
