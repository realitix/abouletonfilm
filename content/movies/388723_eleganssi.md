The film\u2019s protagonists are all wealthy men, for whom hunting is a treasured hobby, a passion and a way of life. The film unfolds in three acts on a scenic autumnal field. Meet the three businessmen: Nokia\u2019s former CEO, Jorma Ollila, engineering company Kone Oy\u2019s owner, Antti Herlin, and the charming narrator, Publishing Company Otava\u2019s former CEO, Heikki A. Reenp\u00e4\u00e4. His narration leads the viewer through hunting expeditions, creates the mood and introduces the people. Almost equally important are the gentlemens\u2019 dogs: handsome pointers and setters, whose pedigrees, abilities and hunting prowess ultimately determine whether any birds are caught at all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qUUJCIpnMJCFnsfT3rV5wRza9HV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
