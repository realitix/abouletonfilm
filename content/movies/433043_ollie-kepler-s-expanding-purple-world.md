Ollie Kepler, wacky astronomy enthusiast and web designer, moves in with his best friend after he loses his fianc\u00e9, but is repeatedly drawn back to the place of her death \u2013 their empty, unpainted apartment. There, a broken promise made to her returns to haunt him with growing intensity.  Ollie\u2019s guilt merges with his scientific brilliance into a crazed attempt to redeem himself. Quitting his job in a bizarre act of defiance, Ollie spirals into a chilling world of obsession and tormenting voices, threatening both his friendship and sanity.  Convinced that a strange piece of rock he has found is a micro-chip which holds a vital message from his fianc\u00e9, Ollie sets about trying to unlock it with disastrous results.
