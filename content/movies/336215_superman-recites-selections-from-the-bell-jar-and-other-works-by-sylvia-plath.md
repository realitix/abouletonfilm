In a dark no-place evocative of Superman's own psychic 'Fortress of Solitude' the alienated Man of Steel recites those sections of Plath's writings that utilize the image of the bell jar. Superman directs these lines to Kandor, the bell jar city that represents his own traumatic past, for he is the only surviving member of a planet that has been destroyed. Kandor now sits, frozen in time, a perpetual reminder of his inability to escape that past, and his alienated relationship to his present world. For us, Kandor is an image of a time that never was \u2014 the utopian city of the future that never came to be.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3mo5UEtY7AfPt4GPwlJxQX9Jzmn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
