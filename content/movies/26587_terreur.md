Plot has three college students meeting up and working together on a documentary about the nature of people\u2019s fears. As things progress it becomes apparent that one of them has an ulterior motive.\r\n\r\nDirector and screenplay writer Anthony DiBlasi spends a considerable portion of the film establishing the psychological make-ups of the principal players, which is a key component to making the film work. Theo Green\u2019s music trundles away menacingly during this portion of pic, while Sam McCurdy\u2019s photography is on the money, with unnerving shades of green, reds and blues stripped back for a perfect troubled world feel.\r\n\r\nOnce the worm turns, and motives and mental anguishes show themselves, Dread reveals a cruel hand of such psychological force that the impact is troubling. Yet this is no torture porn picture, the gore is minimum and this for sure is not a slasher type of film either. It\u2019s a slice of mental cruelty mixed with a damaged seed, two bad aspects of human nature crashing together to assault those interested in the psychologically based splinter of horror.\r\n\r\nOh and the ending is a cracker-jack, guaranteed to jolt you, for better or worse! 7.5/10"}], "recommandations_id": [16167, 19237, 60086, 10085], "youtube_key": "NyTFKDjE3Sw"}
