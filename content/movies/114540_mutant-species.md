An army team is sent to recover it. One of the men is infected and mutates into a monster, killing most of the rest of the team. One man escapes with the help of a brother &amp; sister who live in the woods. He then tries to stop his former buddy, while also fighting against another army team sent in to destroy everything. The bio-material was supposed to create a super-soldier, was banned, and the crash of the rocket appears to have been deliberate so the experiment could proceed. But who is behind it all? And will others be infected?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hGW21uiWVwy3BnDizDk2fPgEkNP.jpg", "actors": ["Leo Rossi (Hollinger)", "Ted Prior (Trotter)", "Denise Crosby (Carol-Anne)", "Grant Gelt (Jordie)", "Powers Boothe (Frost)", "Wilford Brimley (Devro)", "Grant James (Senator Roberts)", "Jackson Bostwick (Tex (A-Team))", "Jack Forcinito (Jones (A-Team))", "Mark Krasnoff (Lorenzo (A-Team))", "Jimmy Steger (Willie (A-Team))", "Ronald McCall (McCall (A-Team))", "Douglas M.
