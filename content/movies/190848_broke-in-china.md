The proprietor believes he's a penniless ne'er-do-well - which he is - but he unexpectedly comes into a small windfall. So the proprietor orders slightly rough around the edges Maud and Mollie, two of his American good time girls working their way around the world, to get him to spend all his money while there. As Donald ends up telling the two good time girls his life story - most specifically about the blonde he let slip through his fingers, she who was the love of his life - a few revelations and the errant coin he left at the roulette wheel betting table change his life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9xhqIQGqbkJub1bxjuMRgW1She3.jpg", "actors": ["Ben Turpin (Donald Drake)", "Louise Carver (Maud - the Saloon Girl)", "Alice Belcher (Mollie - the Saloon Girl)", "Ruth Taylor (Ruth - Donald's Sweetheart)", "Andy Clyde (Ruth's Father)", "Kathrin Clare Ward (Ruth's Mother)", "Dan Maines (Donald's Sailor Buddy)", "William McCall (Proprietor of All Nations Caf\u00e9)", "Tiny Ward (Big Chinese Waiter)", "Dave Morris (Croupier)", "Roger Moore (Ruth's Sweetheart)", "Bud Ross (Singer With Toupee)", "Irving Bacon (Military Officer)", "Ronald Tilley (Minister)", "George Gray (Photographer)", "Hubert Diltz (Man with Photographer)", "Thelma Hill (Minor Role)", "Mary Mayberry (Minor Role)", "Jack Murphy (Smoker with Photographer)", "William Searby (Wedding Guest)", "Frankie Simonds (Double)", "George Spear (Double)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
