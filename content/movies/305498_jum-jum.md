It one is content to see through the specific event. the work exhausts itself in a trivial aspect, the literary. This is most comfortable for the critic: the literary content of a work is easiest to reproduce in a literary form of criticism.\r - http://wernernekes.de/00_cms/cms/front_content.php?idart=550", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AnaVfOpONTgMXHYU62OFBrshxBm.jpg", "actors": ["Dore O.
