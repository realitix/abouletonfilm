The two friends are good friends after graduating from college.  Kim seemed to be pretty and outspoken, but he grew up scolding his patriarchal and stubborn father. In particular, I live in jealousy and qualification for a friend who has always been compared with his father who has been praised as a schoolboy since school and has never been praised.  Han seems to be a good friend of Kim, but in fact, due to the poverty of the home environment, Kim is always getting sucked, and he is forced to stay on Kim. However, it is hiding the long stress and hatred of Kim who always ignores himself.  One day, Kim's father, who was in the pension business, left his pension for Kim's son, Kim, for a while while he was on business for a while. Kim, who liked to play all the time, wants to be a friend of his own limbs at this time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gtcFDk56kx0ACLgdJhxRYoyyLIl.jpg", "actors": ["Do Mo-Se (\uae40\uc11d\ud638 \uc5ed)", "\uc2e0\uc0c1\ub85d (\ud55c\uc815\uc2dd \uc5ed)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
