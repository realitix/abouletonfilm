For this 1988 telecast, the Met assembled a cast capable of tackling both the musical and physical challenges of this bel canto farce, seen here in a whimsical production by John Cox. From the moment he takes the stage with Figaro\u2019s iconic aria \u201cLargo al factotum,\u201d Leo Nucci combines winning charm with a robust baritone. Soprano Kathleen Battle tosses off one glittering vocal display after another as the feisty Rosina, while tenor Rowell Blake makes for an ardent Count Almaviva. Ralf Weikert conducts the lively performance, which also includes the comic duo of Enzo Dara as Dr. Bartolo and Ferruccio Furlanetto as Don Basilio.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rycNe9PIzdPccomEVGoUt89RE41.jpg", "actors": ["Leo Nucci ()", "Kathleen Battle ()", "Rockwell Blake ()", "Enzo Dara ()", "Ferruccio Furlanetto ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
