Its release into orbit over 500km above the Earth marked the birth of one of humanity\u2019s biggest dreams; to place a telescope into space, high above the obscuring effects of the atmosphere, to gain the clearest view of the cosmos we could hope to see.  But in the months which followed it was clear that the dream had turned into a nightmare, as Hubble\u2019s mirror was found to have a flaw.  Three years of heartache and huge human resolve followed, to mount a rescue mission to fix the flaw.  The results were breath taking and produced the most complete view of the Universe we\u2019ve ever had.  This is the story of the men and women who conceived, built, fixed and operated Hubble \u2013 the most celebrated science instrument in history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uxKUEy45qxmO7IWfRIDhzBz7BHq.jpg", "actors": ["Christopher Riley (R\u00e9\u017eie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
