All the characters are committed anarchists. The bomb maker puts an invention together to place it at the disposal of young inexperienced terrorists fighting against Tsarist oppression. The story follows the passing of this bomb from anarchist to anarchist as several attempts are made on the life of Tsarist governor general, until, at the end, it is effectively and harmlessly defused by a bomb expert. The presence of the bomb has a destroying effect on all of the Polish revolutionaries, they either die or breakdown.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6nx7CFWWdtiLN98UpYAwHy3hMOu.jpg", "actors": ["Barbara Grabowska ()", "Adam Ferency ()", "Bogus\u0142aw Linda ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
