Their eleven-year-old son arrives later from boarding school. David conceals a dark secret which caused the family to leave England without telling anybody. They befriend a neighbor Rosanne, who throws out her boyfriend after he beats her up in a bar. Lily, who is very English and out of place in the town, hires the half-Native Rosanne as a housekeeper, and eventually the two women become good friends, until the secret emerges again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pPPozC7rVE8W0QiFnfwDG514u4w.jpg", "actors": ["Kenneth Welsh (David Sutton)", "Tantoo Cardinal (Rosanne Ladouceur)", "Susan Wooldridge (Lily Sutton)", "Vera Marin (Beatrice)", "Diane Debassige (Leona)", "Tom Jackson (Eddy)", "Christopher Barrington-Leigh (Robert Sutton)", "Meredith Rimmer (Naomi Sutton)", "Yolanda Cardinal (Lisa)", "Jeffrey Smith (Nicholas Sutton)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
