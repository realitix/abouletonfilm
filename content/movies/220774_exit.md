This results in the trio taking the dancers and the customers hostage. Why the robbers don't go ahead and escape when the shooting occurs is beyond the viewer. Then all the hostages escape and hide in the club's refrigerator which sort of indicates the intelligence of the stick-up men. Unfortunately, the cops outside are no more intelligent as they stand around outside wondering what to do as one of the strippers who was released crawls back into an extremely large venting system for a small club and rescues the hostages with the help of an ex-cop held inside the club.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dybnhsHw4e6WKkQghX1V6Cnyv9Q.jpg", "actors": ["Shannon Whirry (Diane)", "Joe Bucci (Becque)", "David Bradley (Charles)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
