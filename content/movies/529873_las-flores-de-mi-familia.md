Her daughter Alicia, whom Nivia has lived with for ages, has found a new husband after years of widowhood and understandably wants to move in with him. Nivia disapprove of the relationship and accuses her daughter of abandoning her. Both women embark on a profound and revealing journey where the longing for a new love and the fear of growing old alone inevitably lead to a clash between mother and daughter. The director, Nivia's grandson and Alicia's son, managed to capture in an almost invisible way - as if in a work of fiction - the inevitable sorrow caused by a separation which, nevertheless, took place in a garden where flowers never wither, a dog turns out to be the best psychologist and an annoying pigeon seems to be announcing a miracle.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cNki86JPGCgVv0hTzxayqKUAxP6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
