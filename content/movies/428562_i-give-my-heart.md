DuBarry was the American title of the 1935 British operetta I Give My Heart, based on the stage musical The DuBarry. German actress Gitta Alpar stars as Jeanne, the young 18th century Parisian milliner who sleeps her way to the uppermost rungs of French aristocracy, emerging at last as the glamorous Madame DuBarry, mistress of Louis XV (Owen Nares). Refusing to gloss over DuBarry's sexual peccadilloes (as previous films with Norma Talmadge and Dolores del Rio had done), the film presents the \"heroine\" as a whore, pure and simple-or, on second thought, not so pure and simple! Particularly troublesome for American censors was a scene in which DuBarry is depicted as a resident of a bawdy house. Otherwise, The Loves of Madame DuBarry is standard historical-drama fare, allowing dozens of top European actors to play \"dress-up\" for 90 minutes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/55gjTm22n00aZzAt0A3wJ9X502A.jpg", "actors": ["Gitta Alpar (Madame DuBarry)", "Patrick Waddington (Ren\u00e9)", "Owen Nares (Louis XV)", "Arthur Margetson (Count Du Barry)", "Margaret Bannerman (Marechale)", "Hugh Miller (Choiseul)", "Gibb McLaughlin (De Brissac)", "Iris Ashley (Margot)", "Hay Petrie (Cascal)", "Cicely Paget-Bowman ()", "Charles Castella ()", "Jimmy Godden ()", "Arthur Goullet ()", "Philip Ridgeway (Boy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
