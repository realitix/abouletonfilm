The film follows the trials and tribulations of Jewish refugee Shlomo Vollmus, played by Avraham Doryon. Finally able to legally emigrate to the Holy Land, Shlomo joins a Jewish settlement and sets about to make himself a vital part of his new community. With the exception of Doryon, the cast is comprised of nonprofessionals, none of whom speak on-camera. For the benefit of English-speaking audiences, narration is provided by radio actors Mason Adams (later \"Charlie Hume\" on TV's Lou Grant) and Ann Shepherd.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
