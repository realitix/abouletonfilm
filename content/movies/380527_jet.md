This dialogue-free film (they often do well in our competition) is a gripping thriller in which a man who plans to use a handgun on himself sees a girl being snatched from the curbside. He decides he must act and has the gun if he needs to use it. Jet was a remake of a film Jordan made less than a year before but on a lower budget and tighter shoot. Jordan has since become a great help in running the competition and Facebook page.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.filmsshort.com/short-film-pages/jet-jordan-chesney.html#.Vq7ZNvkrKUl\r\n\r\n- FILMS short"}], "recommandations_id": []}
