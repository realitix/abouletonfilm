Our hero turns to a sex shop for some tools to reach the deep places his patients need worked on. The \"tools\" ordered for this Herculean task of fitting large objects into such small holes are to be delivered by a courier. The deliveryman realizes what he's being asked to deliver and decides to use some of the items to scratch his own itch. But, as we all know, the streets of Paris are wild and he finds himself involved in an accident! His precious cargo goes flying everywhere. The ambulance ride has just the thing to recharge his batteries but the huge spill of toys gets everyone in the mood for love, or something like it, lust. The whole area fills with the sounds of unchained desire and pleasure as Paris, once again, transforms into the city of love. Love as seen through the eyes of a cum drenched orgy and Jean-Daniel Cadinot! The master at his best.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gQQD74S1XeWfsGZDNqQ07OVSjVF.jpg", "actors": ["Assan Ariana ()", "Gilles Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my ()", "Guillaume Pasquier ()", "Alix Shoedler ()", "Lionel Chambon ()", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Chambon ()", "Driss Rachid ()", "Jean-Jacques Elineau ()", "Kamel Amar ()", "Danny Brown ()", "Ta\u00ef Bamako ()", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ravaudet ()", "Beno\u00eet Charde ()", "Diego San Paulo ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
