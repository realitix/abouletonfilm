The screen is broken up into eight more or less equal squares of which, at any one moment, a scene fragment may flickeringly appear in only one frame-corner at a time. As the film moves forward in time and patterns on screen become more complex, the viewer must choose what to focus on.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1ygurkvxkyw0likVnluvsWJMkab.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
