With the assistance of a cheerful porter, she takes the night train and dreams about her arrival. Instead of instant success, she meets disappointment after disappointment, and she needs the unexpected encouragement of her grandmother and an aging, former star whom she meets at a talent night. Finally she gets a call to be an extra, and she's so hopeful that the regulars decide to make a fool of her. Is this the end of Alice's dream? Not if the porter has anything to say about it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7y4VS3gMNdCq8l8BOkEHESKgJwh.jpg", "actors": ["Joan Leslie (Alice Purdee (as Joan Brodel))", "Nana Bryant (Agatha Winters)", "Clara Blandick (Grandmother)", "Clarence Muse (Train Porter)", "Frank Faylen (Master of Ceremonies (uncredited))", "Alan Hale (Carlo's Guest (uncredited))", "Marion Mack (Well-Wisher at Train Station (uncredited))", "Frank Mayo (Sam Purdee (uncredited))", "Ronald Reagan (Carlo's Guest (uncredited))", "Alexis Smith (Carlo's Guest (uncredited))", "Craig Stevens (Carlo's Guest (uncredited))", "Jane Wyman (Carlo's Guest (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
