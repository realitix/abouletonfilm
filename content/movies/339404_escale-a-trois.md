She always gives 100% and I respect her for that immensely. The same goes for her in _The Layover_, but this straight up is not a good film.\r\n\r\nThe leads are just not on the same level (in terms of both the actors and the characters), virtually none of the jokes land, and almost everything in _The Layover_ we have seen (and groaned at) a dozen times before. The payoff for the central conflict is actually oddly satisfying in a way that, I at least personally, haven't seen before. But everything leading up to it, and the short tag following it, were totally not striking a chord with me.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"}], "recommandations_id": [454992, 397422, 454619, 431530]}
