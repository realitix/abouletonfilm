The tent goes up. Schoolboys run to the tent. Village women come and watch an acrobat roll a hoop across a tightrope. A lion leaps from the edge of one stool - across darkness - on to another stool. A gap-toothed old woman gazes at a goat on a tight rope; her eyes are wide with curiosity.  For three days the circus makes small ripples in the life of this village. Municipal permits are required. At a toddy shop, a soldier befriends the circus strongman; a pump attendant sits on a rock each day watching a village girl bathe and dry her hair. The dwarf brings back to the circus a watermelon larger than his head. In the film's three days, we, the viewers, learn the geography of the village: the banyan treewith leaves like transparent film, the shining water, the light on the sand at sunset. When the circus leaves the village, it leaves us. The narrative says: The circus comes and leaves; life goes on.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Av5bJdz5atmyl4VltIcZdjkU7w7.jpg", "actors": ["Jalaja ()", "Nedumudi Venu ()", "V K Sreeraman ()", "Gopi (Circus Manager)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "4Juw5R_kjyo"}
