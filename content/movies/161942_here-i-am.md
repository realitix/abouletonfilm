The atmospheric documentary opens with hilly East Bay streets shrouded in fog. The mist lifts as the film moves to children at play. Often shown in unobtrusive close-up, the youngsters appear as thinking individuals, enjoying the swings, puzzling out problems, or interacting with their teacher in the classroom.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/op1u7zLAa5RrSNx68Zh2GgjE5g5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
