During his summer vacation, Kiyotaka Sato plans to get his driver's license to impress schoolmate Matsuda (Yukino Kishii).  At this time, a yakuza boss (Ken Mitsuishi) orders Todoroki (Kento Kaku) to get his driver\u2019s license. Todoroki doesn't show his feelings outwardly.  Later, Todoroki drives a car without a driver\u2019s license and he hits Kiyotaka Sato. To cover up the accident, Kiyotaka Sato is placed in a car and taken to away. He arrives at an unofficial driving school. The driving school is run by the Uehara family. There, Kiyotaka Sato and Todoroki learn that they graduated from the same high school. They spend their summer at the driving school.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xzXt47DsqS7kmt2687PGWD7pI1p.jpg", "actors": ["Shuuhei Nomura (Kiyotaka Sato)", "Kento Kaku (Todoroki)", "Yukino Kishii (Matsuda)", "Takuma Otoo (Tomori Honda)", "Toshie Negishi (Grandmother)", "Dankan (Grandfather)", "Kumiko Aso (Instructor)", "Ken Mitsuishi (Yakuza Boss)", "Satoru Jitsunashi ()", "Chuck Johnson (Brian)", "Daisuke Kuroda ()", "Sergey Kuvaev (Daniel)", "Ozuno Nakamura ()", "Jyonmyon Pe ()", "Ritsu Otomo ()", "Ryutaro Ninomiya ()", "Mayumi Sato ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "zH2H93LlTOo"}
