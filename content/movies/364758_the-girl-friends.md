Jack and the two girls (played by then campus objects of desire Jane Washington and Margaret Harrison) leap up from a series of dinner table pontifications \u2013 though we\u2019ve already had a clue about the next event when Kate says, \u201cMy idol for this week is going to be that weedy little man in Godard\u2019s film\u201d.  Then the music starts. All three eventually dance in an attempted replay of the number in Godard\u2019s movie. Its shot front-on in the manner of Griffith, with the dancers moving towards and back from the stationary camera for almost all of the three minutes of the song, until near the end there is a cut to a medium close-up. Exhilarating. Funny. And remembered down the ages.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
