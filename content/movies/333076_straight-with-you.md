Although his family knows, he's afraid to tell his schoolmates, as he thinks they might start bullying him. What should he do when the coolest girl in his class sends him a love letter?  Both openly and intimately the film portrays the world of a child who knows he's homosexual at a very young age. The film asks questions that apply to everybody: What does it mean to be different? What is it like to have a secret? And how do you really know who you are?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m1XXf8wUbnwiaAkOmHY2HytIUe9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
