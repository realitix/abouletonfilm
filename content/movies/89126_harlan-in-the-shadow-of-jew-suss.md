His most perfidious film was the treacherous anti-Semitic propaganda film Jud S\u00fc\u00df - required viewing for all SS members. An unrepentant and blindly obsessive craftsman, no figure - save for Leni Riefenstahl - is as closely associated with the cinema of the Holocaust years. (Harlan's epic Kolberg was the basis for Inglourious Basterds's pivotal film-within-a-film Stolz Der Nation.) This documentary is an eye-opening examination of World War II film history as well as the story of a German family from the Third Reich to the present; one that is marked by reckoning, denial and liberation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5pwc8oZHU2crTM9791Gkiu2MftH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
