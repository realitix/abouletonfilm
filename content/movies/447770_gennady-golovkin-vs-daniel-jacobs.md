The pair of hard-punching middleweights will headline Saturday\u2019s HBO PPV card (9 p.m. ET) from Madison Square Garden in New York, where Golovkin, a native of Kazakhstan, has built a boisterous following thanks to four knockout victories inside \u201cThe World\u2019s Most Famous Arena.\u201d  Golovkin will look for his 24th consecutive knockout against Jacobs, a secondary titlist from the same Brownsville section of Brooklyn, New York, that has produced so many great fighters. Jacobs, who returned to boxing in 2012 after beating a rare form of bone cancer, is 10-0 with 10 KOs since coming back.  GGG will also aim for his 18th straight title defense, which would move him two shy of Bernard Hopkins\u2019 middleweight record.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s8TOMnlrdDvQKdVXCUc5njdmaG4.jpg", "actors": ["Gennady Golovkin (Himself)", "Daniel Jacobs (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
