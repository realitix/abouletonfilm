My hair was long and black. It has turned white. It hasn't been cut since 1982, almost thirty years ago. Story of my Hair is a journey, both in space and in time. Anyone looking for truths, whether geographical, scientific or historical, will be disappointed. After looking at real events and real places the film very soon distances itself from them, preferring poetry and fiction. In his own fashion the auteur has combined the story of Samson and Delilah, the journey of those condemned to the death camps, the science of hair and a few thoughts about the meaning and fragility of life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lhLWaXhklgj0leWC1xeDBrO11yf.jpg", "actors": ["Boris Lehman ()", "Nadine Wandel ()", "Marie Duez ()", "Igor Pototsky ()", "Ludmilla Samodayeva ()", "Olgied Kuryllo ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
