This wonderful tower is 1,000 feet in height, and the picture produces a most sensational effect. As the camera leaves the ground and rises to the top of the tower, the enormous white city opens out to the view of the astonished spectator. Arriving at the top of the tower, a bird's eye view of the Exposition looking toward the Trocadero, and also toward the Palace of Electricity, is made, and the camera begins its descent. The entire trip is shown on a 200-foot film. 30.00. We furnish the ascent in 125 foot film.\u201d (Edison film catalog)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dxtWiUBLhGFwwMkQeE3tM3bnyHR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [163111, 162612, 77851, 191595], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
