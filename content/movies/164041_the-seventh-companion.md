A brilliant, gripping portrait of the era of \"Red Terror\" during the civil war that followed the Bolshevik revolution, The Seventh Companion offers a superlative character study in General Adamov (Andrei Popov), a law professor in the tsarist army, who is incarcerated by the Bolshevik secret police along with many other members of the bourgeoisie. Finally released into the new world of the Soviet Union, the resigned officer finds that he has lost everything from his old life except a mantel clock that he carries through the night from place to place, until he ends up, like Rossellini's inmate seeking readmission to prison in Dov\u00e8 la liberta?, back where he started.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a8ZsnFTVkeR7CbY9YjHG4s3ICM0.jpg", "actors": ["Andrei Popov (Maj.
