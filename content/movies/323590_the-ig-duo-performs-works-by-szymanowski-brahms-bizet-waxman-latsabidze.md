Produced by Red Piranha Films LLC, directed by Oscar Torres. Camera operators: Daniel Gonzalez, Ronan Sweeney. Although temperamentally quite different, both Irmina Trynkos and Giorgi Latsabidze enjoyed stellar careers as violin and pianos virtuosos, touring widely and thrilling audiences with their astonishing virtuosity and innate showmanship.These two extraordinary artists wholly individual, representing a synergistic combination from some of the most compelling personalities in classical music. They are alternatively fierce, despairing, and exultant. The two musicians are in perfect accord here and this recording brought great joy to this listener.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
