Why did this happen ? Was it skill and leadership, the training, the quality and bravery of the soldiers, luck, a successful artillery barrage or poor German performance. Most probably a bit of all these factors. This is the story of the 7th Bedfords,  a Kitchener battalion in General Maxse's 18th Eastern Div. The Bedfords captured all their objectives, assisted the units on their flanks and established a new defensive line a mile beyond their objective.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1rrYoF9MKupulOR5AjUvY6Hx3R8.jpg", "actors": ["Andrew Duff (Presenter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
