All life \u2013 human and animal \u2013 is dominated by this rampaging weather system. From the northern shores of Australia to the highest peaks of the Himalayas and the wind-blown deserts of northern India to the lush equatorial forests of Borneo, this series makes an exhilarating journey through the lands of the monsoon. Along the way, it offers a taste of the variety and colour of the different regions\u2019 most extraordinary wildlife and cultures and the way they cope with the tumultuous weather. This is the story of a relationship between humans and nature that has grown across thousands of years \u2013 all living in the shadow of the monsoon.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p4uQZUE793DgLEmTLfStJVDlR8N.jpg", "actors": ["Colin Salmon (Himself - Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
