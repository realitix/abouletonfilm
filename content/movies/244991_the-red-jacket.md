The father donates the boy's red jacket to charity, where it ends up in war-torn Sarajevo. The boy's parents are killed, and he almost is. Some UN soldiers find him, and send him to a hospital in Germany. He escapes the hospital, is hit by a car (but unhurt). The driver reads the tag inside the jacket and \"returns\" the boy to the grieving father.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dzLOn0G5wWKbK5NIj2Mehr7sdsK.jpg", "actors": ["Ulrich Noethen (Vater)", "Catrin Striebeck (Autofahrerin)", "Tetje Mierendorf (DRK-Helfer)", "Philipp Hochmair (UN - Sanit\u00e4ter 1)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
