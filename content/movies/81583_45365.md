From the patrol car to the courtroom, the playground to the nursing home, the parade to the prayer service, it explores relationships and interactions - with people and their environment. The stories of a father and son, a young relationship, cops and criminals, officials and their electorate coalesce into a mosaic of faces, places, and events. 45365 is a portrait of a city and its people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/weEmv3IZVJDmp8gFoFEeIXAMZeo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Xz6sXjnOu10"}
