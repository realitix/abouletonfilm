When Claudine investigates the case of a soldier convicted of rape, she discovers that his trial was unfair and that he was convicted on the basis of little evidence. In her journey to obtain justice, she uncovers a system where the basic principles of law are ignored. And when the system fails, everyone becomes a victim. The documentary not only provides a glimpse into the failings of the Congolese judicial system but also raises questions about the role of the international community and non-governmental organizations in reforming it.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
