I watched this documentary and now I want to visit Romania desperately! I want to make a roadtrip through the rural villages and meet this awesome people. I admire their mindset, the way they're connected with nature and the christian values that rule their lifes. These are good people. I feel that this world is better because there's people like them in here. Finally, I felt so emotional to see that here in my country, across the world, the landscapes, the mountains, the flora, the valleys are very similar and especially  the peasants who farm and take care of the land with so much love. Hope to visit your beautiful country some day. God Bless you All Romania!\ufeff", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hrg5GoCKcLTVomUxtunDoIJ63UW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
