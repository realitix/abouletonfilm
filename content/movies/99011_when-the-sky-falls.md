Hampered by the system, a police consort is ineffectual at aiding her despite trying to step outside of the normal bounds. Kevin McNally plays her husband, who hates her activities and the danger in which she places herself. Nonetheless, he grudgingly admires her persistence and encourages her investigation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2hSQXFUM7ETfWY2B8jSMi1NmI2l.jpg", "actors": ["Joan Allen (Sinead Hamilton)", "Patrick Bergin (Mackey)", "Pete Postlethwaite (Martin Shaughnessy)", "Liam Cunningham (John Cosgrave)", "Kevin McNally (Tom Hamilton)", "Karl Argue (Smokey)", "Jimmy Smallhorne (Mickey O'Fagan)", "Gerard Mannix Flynn (Dave Hackett)", "Danny O'Carroll (Shaughnessy's Son)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
