After experiencing boundless sensuality and freedom with the fun-loving Venus (soprano), the singer Tannh\u00e4user (Tenor) finds it impossible to conform to the cultured setting of his betrothed Elizabeth (soprano), who loves him. During a singing contest, Tannh\u00e4user describes the affair with Venus as the ultimate love experience and because of that, he is cast out from the established society. Thanks to Elizabeth's intervention, he is allowed to undertake a pilgrimage to the Pope to ask for the Holy Father's pardon. If the Pope accepts to forgive him, he would be allowed to take back his place in society. Tannh\u00e4user accepts. But fate will not allow him to meet with his beloved Elizabeth again in this life. This is a recording of the legendary staging by G\u00f6tz Friedrich for the 1978 Bayreuth Festival conducted by Sir Colin Davis.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3B8rE9kKhiFgV5ObWZY5vhU7JQR.jpg", "actors": ["Gwyneth Jones (Elisabeth / Venus)", "Spas Wenkoff (Tannh\u00e4user)", "Bernd Weikl (Wolfram von Eschenbach)", "Hermann Hans Sotin (Landgraf)", "Robert Schunk (Walther von der Vogelweide)", "Franz Mazura (Biterolf)", "John Pickering (Heinrich der Schreiber)", "Heinz Feldhoff (Reinmar von Zweter)", "Klaus Brettschneider (Ein junger Hirt)", "Irene Hammann (Edelknaben)", "Angelika Jung-Nowski (Edelknaben)", "Roswitha Korff-Kr\u00fcger (Edelknaben)", "Natuse von Stegmann (Edelknaben)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
