In ancient Egyptian culture, the Book of the Dead consisted of religious texts intended to help preserve the spirit of the departed in the afterlife \u2014 but in Elder\u2019s reading, that comforting idea of continuity takes on a rather darker cast. Lamentations is comprised of a complex audio and visual patchwork: a philosophical meditation superimposed as text throughout the film; vignettes featuring a comical but disturbing Franz Liszt, a debate between Isaac Newton and George Berkeley, an angry, deranged man in an alley, and an arrogant psychiatrist; and a final search for salvation in the forests of British Columbia, the American Southwest, and Mexico\u2019s Yucatan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/at8cnYkboGH4YjxpyNvVJUEpBjf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
