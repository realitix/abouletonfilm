Small-time ride operator, Eddie Miranda, proudly operates a carnival contraption called the Zipper in the heart of Coney Island's gritty amusement district. When his rented lot is snatched up by a real estate mogul, Eddie and his ride become casualties of a power struggle between the developer and the City of New York over the future of the world-famous destination. Be it an affront to history or simply the path of progress, the spirit of Coney Island is at stake. In an increasingly corporate landscape, where authenticity is often sacrificed for economic growth, the Zipper may be just the beginning of what is lost.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3xDwyQNrNbGJhtPIUr0z7hHtsLL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [{"pseudo": "OzDrDj", "content": "Looking forward to watching this, but just wanted to say, from Kid to Adult, this is still the scariest ride i've even been on.
