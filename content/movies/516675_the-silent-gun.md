Indeed, Daisuke himself is almost killed while investigating the case. This occurred while he was with Ritsuko, daughter of a company president. Detective Kimura thinks that the president himself, returned to Japan after an absence of fifteen years, might be the killer, or at least the man who supplied the gun. Ritsuko's father limps and though she explains this as the result of a traffic accident, Kimura remembers a narcotics smuggler named Suginami who shot himself in the ankle and then escaped from the hospital. He believes that the company president and the drug peddler are the same.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jir\u00f4 Tamiya (Daisuke Kamoi)", "Shigeru Amachi (Junta Kimura)", "Takuya Fujioka (Tsune-san)", "Michiko Sugata (Ritsuko Nakazawa)", "Sumiko Sakamoto (Tamako Tamamura)", "Yuko Hamada (Yumiko Tachikawa)", "Masako Akeboshi (Aoyama)", "Yasushi Nagata (Michihiko Nakazawa)", "K\u00f4 Sugita (Toru Funayama)", "K\u00f4ji Fujiyama (Eizo Obata)", "Akira Natsuki (Fuchida)", "K\u00f4ichi Mizuhara (Kubo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
