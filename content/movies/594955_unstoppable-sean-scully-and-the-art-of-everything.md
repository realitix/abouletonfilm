Little known at home but a superstar abroad, Sean flies around the world to open 15 major museum exhibitions - a journey that also reveals his extraordinary life story.  Now, at the age of 73, Scully opens up about his unique experiences spanning 55 years in an often hostile art world - how he built a reputation from nothing, having grown up penniless on the streets of Dublin and London, often homeless as a child and running with street gangs as a teenager, to turn his striped paintings into the huge success they are today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hPFdJFsTsJB6e2BD3SshXFIcK2t.jpg", "actors": ["Sean Scully (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
