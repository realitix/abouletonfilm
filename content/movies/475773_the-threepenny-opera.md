The show opens with a mock-Baroque overture, a nod to Threepenny's source, The Beggar's Opera, a brilliantly successful parody of Handel's operas written by John Gay in 1728. In a brief prologue following the overture, a shabby figure comes onstage with a barrel organ and launches into a song chronicling the crimes of the notorious bandit and womanizer Macheath, \"Mack the Knife.\" The setting is a fair in Soho (London), just before Queen Victoria's coronation.  In this production, Weill champion HK Gruber led the Ensemble Modern in a performance of Weill's complete original score, the first time it had been heard in Germany in many years. This production was broadcast on German television (3sat).", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Friedrich Karl Praetorius (Macheath, genannt Mackie Messer)", "J\u00fcrgen Holtz (Jonathan Jeremiah Peachum)", "Ingeborg Engelmann (Celia Peachum, seine Frau)", "Katherina Lange (Polly Peachum, seine Tochter)", "Axel B\u00f6hmert (Brown, Polizeichef von London)", "Dorothee Hartinger (Lucy, seine Tochter)", "Carola Regnier (Die Spelunken-Jenny)", "Romanus M.
