New Jersey is the third largest producer of cranberries in the United States, after Wisconsin and Massachusetts. Today, in the sandy, acidic soils of the New Jersey Pine Barrens, descendants of the earliest cranberry pioneers raise their crops on the same land farmed by their ancestors as far back as 1840.
