For starters, a framing device has been added: After appearing in 300 consecutive appearances of Fledermaus (which translates as The Bat) the lead tenor (Georg Alexander) imagines that he's seeing bats everywhere. Driven a bit over the edge by all this, he falls asleep and has a nightmare about the opera, with a group of non-singers cast in the leading roles. The original libretto about romantic assignations, political imprisonments and mistaken identity is burlesqued to the hilt: at one point, the hero finds out that his prison cell is surrounded by rubber tubes!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hRfEYwuN7hXS59W7STpGdhcdufz.jpg", "actors": ["L\u00edda Baarov\u00e1 (Maria Weigel / Rosalinde)", "Hans S\u00f6hnker (Kammers\u00e4nger Hans Weigel / Eisenstein)", "Friedl Czepa (Hanni / Adele)", "Jola Jobst (Berta / Ida)", "Georg Alexander (Staatsanwalt Wentin / Frank)", "Robert Dorsay (Chauffeur Franz / Alfred)", "Hans Moser (Hans Moser)", "Harald Paulsen (Rechtsanwalt Dr. Rommel / Dr.Falke)", "Karel Stepanek (Attach\u00e9 Baranoff / Orlovsky)", "Hans Stiebner (Kapellmeister)", "Otto Graf (Rundfunkreporter)", "Albert Ihle (Pr\u00e4sident)", "Arthur Kistenmacher (Polizist)", "Erwin Werner (B\u00fchnenarbeiter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
