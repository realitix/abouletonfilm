This film combines rare archival footage with interviews that document the courageous efforts of those who fought to break the silence, change the laws and end the shame which surrounded abortion when it was a crime. The film is the second of the Abortion Rights Film Trilogy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ufbvLsNm7vvAYCvDfdTQ2gzFTaJ.jpg", "actors": ["Dorothy Fadiman (Director)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
