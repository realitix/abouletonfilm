Later, a woman wakes from a nightmare. Jenny Haniver takes its title from a cryptid totem sold for centuries at the docks of Antwerp: a Jenny Haniver or jeune d\u2019anvers (young girl of Antwerp) is a disfigured ray or skate carcass, carved to resemble an angel, a devil, a dragon. A series of ten filmed portraits are subject to all manner of alteration. By this they compose the hull of a ship wrecked on rocks sung by sirens. To mirror its namesake, the film\u2019s plastic properties have been carved, lacerated, bleached, otherwise stressed, reshaped to transform reality into the fantastic and unknowable.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8SgtDy02hjWgrm9EAUfwzUHN0j7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
