Rather, it offered an exclusive, \"behind the scenes\" look into WWE and its talent, both in-ring and otherwise.[1] The show also periodically broke kayfabe and used professional wrestling slang. Confidential was discontinued in 2004 and was replaced with The WWE Experience, a more traditional weekly summary show.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8ZrjnP2mKtaH8OZ700QOk4c9fSQ.jpg", "actors": ["Eric Bischoff ()", "Bret Hart ()", "Trish Stratus ()", "Michael Shawn Hickenbottom ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
