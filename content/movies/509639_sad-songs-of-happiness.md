An exciting journey awaits the students: their trip will lead them out of their conflict-ridden everyday life to the first round of the competition, which will be held in Istanbul in 2013. For those who succeed in this round the journey continues to Germany where the competition celebrates its 50th anniversary. Every single girl brings the right qualities to reach the local finals: musical talent, a special voice - and a never ending joy of singing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bJKH5O55lsl7RuyvzgRv2lvSEHK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
