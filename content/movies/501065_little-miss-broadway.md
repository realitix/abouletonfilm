Actually, there are penniless Broadway characters and, in order to avoid Judy learning the truth, they take possession of a Long Island mansion owned by a thief presently doing time in Sing Sing. Judy arrives with her fianc\u00e9 Dick Nichols (John Shelton) and his father, an industrialist who tries to sell worthless stock to Judy's family in order to bolster his shaky financial status. They give him $200,000, part of the stashed loot they found belonging to the home-owner thief. The latter escapes from prison.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/otlcJYEZhbwrnyh29li5sppHNvh.jpg", "actors": ["Jean Porter (Judy Gibson)", "John Shelton (Richard 'Dick' Nichols, II)", "Ruth Donnelly (Aunt Minerva Van Dorn)", "Doris Houck (Ina Mae Sullivan (as Doris Colleen))", "Edward Gargan (Uncle George (as Edward F.
