Paul Joyce, who directed it, has also made documentaries about Nicolas Roeg, David Cronenberg, Nagisa Oshima, and Dennis Hopper, and he knows the conventional format well enough to get the most out of it. There are good clips and interesting commentaries from the interviewed subjects, who include Wenders himself, cinematographer Robby Muller, filmmaker Sam Fuller, novelist Patricia Highsmith, musician Ry Cooder, actors Harry Dean Stanton, Peter Falk, and Hanns Zischler, and critic Kraft Wetzel, who is especially provocative. A must-see for Wenders fans, highly recommended for everyone else. \u2013Jonathan Rosenbaum, 1989", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Peter Falk ()", "Dennis Hopper ()", "Harry Dean Stanton ()", "Wim Wenders ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
