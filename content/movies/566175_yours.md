A former actress living in a beautiful, spacious home, Billie shuffles around her indoor pool and feeds her dog. But she's lonely for affection. Enter Golden Love, an over 50 dating site where she gets a message from a man named Michael3490 and quickly begins imagining a new life. Brennan's film offers a delightful mix of the melancholic and the dreamy, highlighting the vulnerability of non-tech-savvy users in our digital age, while also charming us with Billie's innocence and hopefulness.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
