Faithfully adhering to Beckett's minimalist original, a black parody of love, marriage, and our search for meaning in an unfathomable universe, the piece consists of but two pathetic characters. One, wife Winnie, spends the duration of the drama half-buried in a pile of dirt; in true Beckett fashion, her predicament is never explained. The other character, husband Willie, is almost never seen. Dublin stage and screen veteran Rosaleen Linehan, in the lead, is exceptional as the trapped woman clinging to the empty, arbitrary routines and rituals of life, ever hopeful that 'this is going to be a happy day.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hr43jg0KtcfSc8xJRDWPeUC0cOx.jpg", "actors": ["Rosaleen Linehan (Winnie)", "Richard Johnson (Willie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
