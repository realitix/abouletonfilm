The directress stands them in a row, and taking the head off each, throws it onto a huge music staff and each becomes a note of the scale. The whole bodies appear again, after which the manipulator seems to wrap them up in a large sheet of music, which is then shown to contain nothing. The paper is rolled up again, and a cane is held, perpendicularly, in a horizontal position to the sheet.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uNNLFdqYONVUfCWSpT9x9Wxl9cb.jpg", "actors": ["Julienne Mathieu ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [116363, 144462, 196598, 232308], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
