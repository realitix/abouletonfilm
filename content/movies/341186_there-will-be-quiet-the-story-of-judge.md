In the decades that followed, Judge's meager output became hardcore punk 101 for much of the growing scene who built upon their metal-tinged riffs and attitude. While the legend grew, lead singer Mike Ferraro virtually disappeared, only to reemerge in 2013 at Webster Hall to headline one of the most respected hardcore punk festivals in the country, Black N\u2019 Blue Bowl. Noisey caught up with the revered frontman during, before, and after his triumphant return to the stage in this four-part series.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vHWUeJCSY3Msh0OP0Pj26vWQwbB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
