In November, 2007, thirteen opera lovers from Michael Tisma\u2019s Ovations International opera tour travelled to Teatro Municipale Valli in Emiglia Romana to see Bologna\u2019s production of Boccanegra. Without exception, everyone considered it an emotionally gripping performance of Verdi\u2019s pessimistic tale of spiritual disturbance and foreboding. What is evident while watching the DVD is the difference between the confident execution and polish of the Teatro Valli performance and the unfinished, yet promising rendition caught at the opera\u2019s prima in Bologna.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mbocmAh5Wn6QgSmPCqLo5lvk9Bf.jpg", "actors": ["Roberto Frontali ()", "Carmen Giannattasio ()", "Giacomo Prestia ()", "Marco Vratogna ()", "Alberto Rota ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
