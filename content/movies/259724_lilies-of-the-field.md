Griffith is cast as Mildred Harker, who loses custody of her child in a messy divorce settlement. Leaving her hometown in disgrace, Mildred heads to New York, where after a crash course in the school of hard knocks she joins the chorus of a Ziegfeld-like musical revue. Now a full-fledged gold-digger, she enjoys the favors of backstage johnnies and elderly sugar daddies, but finally finds true love in the form of Park Avenue socialite Ted Willing (Ralph Forbes).  Remake of 1924 film of the same name and star.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tMD8nBGNbOWuaDitwaVw9B3CEJp.jpg", "actors": ["Corinne Griffith (Mildred Harker)", "Ralph Forbes (Ted Willing)", "John Loder (Walter Harker)", "Eve Southern (Pink)", "Jean Laverty (Gertie (as Jean Bary))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
