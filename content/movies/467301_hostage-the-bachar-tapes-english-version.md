In 1999, Bachar collaborated with The Atlas Group to produce 53 videotapes about his captivity. Tapes #17 and #31 are the only two tapes Bachar makes available outside of Lebanon. In the tapes, Bachar addresses the cultural, textual, and sexual aspects of his detention with the Americans.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p0D13h2LjL1IIiNcxso0YicQYGU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
