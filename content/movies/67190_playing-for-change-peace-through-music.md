The idea for this project arose from a common belief that music has the power to break down boundaries and overcome distances between people. No matter whether people come from different geographic, political, economic, spiritual or ideological backgrounds, music has the universal power to transcend and unite us as one human race. And with this truth firmly fixed in our minds, we set out to share it with the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i9jdepSHcl303boHYoT3NpCz7rz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
