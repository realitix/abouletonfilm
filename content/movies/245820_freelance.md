A daunting task considering he is both camera man and reporter, can't drive, and still lives in his mother's basement. Further complicating matters is Roy Henry who, as Elliot's childhood bully tortured the boy, and is now a born again Christian/recovering alcoholic seeking forgiveness. He is also seeing Elliot's mother. Elliot escapes an unacceptable home life in the guise of Lance Windchaser, his journalistic alter-ego. He enlists Toby, a suburban taxi driver, to be his cameraman, which Toby accepts in an attempt to escape his own hellacious home life. When he receives a letter from his idol ridiculing his efforts, Elliot snaps, and begins a psychotic vandalism/reporting spree whose consequences may very well allow Elliot to truly MAKE the news.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
