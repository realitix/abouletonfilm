It started with a heist at a bank (obviously), done by two people in a clever and rather peaceful way (they start by locking up the nearby cops, so they can't come after them), but when I finally started to focus on the movie, I had completely lost the plot. The one minute these two were acting like friends, the next... they seem like they hate eachother.\r\n\r\nBut honestly, I dont think that it matters much. The plot is just an excuse in this movie, for two people to have some fun together. I mean, even though I had little knowledge of what was going on, I still had some fun watching the rest of it, more or less (I did get distracted a few times again). The two people are, of course, Mark Wahlberg and Denzel Washington. They are like children playing with their characters, just enjoying themselves.\r\n\r\nImagine if the plot had been interesting and worthwhile, then maybe this could actually have been a great movie, or wait... maybe the plot was interesting and worthwhile, I just never realized it because I got distracted.\r\n\r\n_Last words... great moments in this movie and a lot of fun dialogue... even if you don't pay too close to the plot._"}], "recommandations_id": [134374, 59961, 117251, 77866], "youtube_key": "qnWIR2jFklo"}
