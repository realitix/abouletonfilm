When in times of drought the water everywhere else has dried into nothingness, the water on the Lohhof is abundant and fresh. But one very dry summer, the drought comes to the Lohhof, too, and this time, the source of the water has dried up. And so, with diving rod in hand, one of the farm's old peasants goes on his merry little way to find a new source of water. At one point, the diving rod bends so strongly, that it almost slips out of the old man's hands. Convinced that there must be a huge source of water nearby, all the farmers of the Lohhof bend their backs to find the new well. They dig long, but they dig in vain: no water is found, only a strange sand, which is yellowish, shiny and flickers golden in the sun.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7V9lWSS1YILA0mdcRYhV7TEiopq.jpg", "actors": ["Eugen Kl\u00f6pfer (Lohhofbauer)", "Bernhard Minetti (Wolfgang Lusinger)", "Lina Carstens (Lohhofb\u00e4uerin)", "K\u00e4te Merk (Maria)", "Alexander Trojan (Hannes)", "Carl Wery (Sprecher der Bauern)", "Luis Rainer (Alter Lusinger)", "Elise Aulinger (Moosb\u00e4uerin)", "Ludwig Schmid-Wildy (Wirt)", "Fritz Reiff (Richter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
