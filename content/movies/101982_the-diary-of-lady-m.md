Despite the fact that she is unlikely to become famous, she enjoys her life as a performer who lives just outside the mainstream. Awaiting her backstage one evening is a Spanish painter who has seen her show and wants to make her acquaintance. They walk around Paris getting to know one another, and then the painter returns to Spain. Something about the man has moved Lady M to passion: she flies to meet him in Barcelona and he shows her his beloved Catalonia. This time, however, their relationship is as much about passionate lovemaking as it is about compatibility. So smitten is Lady M with her new man that when she discovers that the painter has a black wife and child, she is only a little bit taken aback and she invites his whole family to join her in Paris. Surprisingly, they do, and the number of people sharing their love and sexual appetites changes from two to three.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qLtmcsrGf1GW7jetGa3EIVc9naa.jpg", "actors": ["Myriam M\u00e9zi\u00e8res (M)", "Juanjo Puigcorb\u00e9 (Diego)", "F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Wouassi (Nuria)", "Nanou (Dancer)", "Marie Peyrucq-Yamou (Dancer)", "Gladys Gambie (Dancer)", "Antoine Basler (Man)", "Makeda (Billie)", "Albert Planes (Night Porter)", "Roger Mendri (Fighter)", "Carlota Soldevila (Woman)", "Olivier Ceyssens (Little Boy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
