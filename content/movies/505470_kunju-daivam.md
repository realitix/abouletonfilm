One fine day, God answers Joseph's prayers - the only problem is that it was Joseph's grandfather who passed away. A guilt-ridden Joseph is convinced that he is responsible for the demise of his grandpa, and decides to redeem himself by saving someone from death - not only through prayers, but also by the virtue of his deeds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zK2LK12WqFgXBYicyV3ndAogFzi.jpg", "actors": ["Adish Praveen (Joseph)", "Joju George ()", "Sidhartha Siva ()", "Reina Maria ()", "Alexander Prasanth ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "yCm5GShD3y4"}
