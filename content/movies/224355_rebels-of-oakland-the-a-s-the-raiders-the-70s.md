Even to good boys all the way across the country in New Hampshire, the authority-flouting baseball A's and football Raiders were magical. Not only did they win championships, they did it amid clubhouse brawls, feuds with an owner and a general embrace of the 1960s aesthetic.  Filmmakers Rick Bernstein and Ross Greenburg tell the stories of these turbulent, talented teams and show how they perfectly fit their city. Oakland was blue collar and home to hardcore hard-core 1960s rebellion, exemplified by the Black Panthers. Oakland, especially, was not San Francisco, the effete, world-class city across the bay.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rc9ovrusS56WpuR79BaYksmEEhq.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Hanks ()", "John Madden ()", "Chuck Santana ()", "Kenny Stabler ()", "Reggie Jackson ()", "Rollie Fingers ()", "Liev Schreiber ()", "MC Hammer ()", "Tom Swartwout (Editor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
