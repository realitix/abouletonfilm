The narrator is a first-year student at an all-boys Buddhist school. Jaded by his dull, ordinary life, he longs for the type of creative, liberal and forward life his idol Bob Dylan leads, writing rock songs alone in his room, imitating his hero's signature croon, until one day he got invited on an island trip of sexual liberation with his fellow liberal friend.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1EHPiGn7uqrejpsDt6fFjffl6xC.jpg", "actors": ["Daichi Watanabe (Jun)", "Kazunobu Mineta (Hige Godzilla)", "Shigeru Kishida (Hippie)", "Asami Usuda (Olive)", "Chiemi Hori (Okan)", "Lily Franky (Oton)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
