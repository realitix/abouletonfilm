The soft autumn light of Galiano Island is beautifully rendered in writer/producer Peggy Thompson's The Lotus Eaters, and that's not the only elusive element that this film has captured.  In revisiting its particular time and place - the Gulf Islands of the early '60s -Thompson obviously draws on her own family experiences there.  For those who share Thompson's love of Gulf Islands magic, the elements she has assembled will feel as familiar as their own childhood blanket.  But there are problems at the core of this story about a family's loss of innocence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9vEsOqcyDKXQPQqvYRaiC3VgAok.jpg", "actors": ["Tara Frederick (Cleo Kingswood)", "Aloka McLean (Zoe Kingswood)", "R.
