Its identity was born on the Internet and for years, travelers would make the trek down a lonely dirt road and camp next to the booth, in the hopes that it might suddenly ring, and they could connect with a stranger (often from another country) on the other end of the line. This is the story of four disparate people whose lives intersect with this mystical outpost, and the comfort they seek from a stranger's voice: There is Beth, a troubled woman facing dilemmas with her love-life and a recurring, baffling crime; Mary, a young South African, who is contemplating selling her body for the funds to escape her dreadful existence; Alex, a woman who is losing her lover, Glory, to the belief she is plagued by aliens, and Richard, driven into desperation by a separation from his wife, who happens upon the booth after his failed suicide attempt.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vOri67GigPJ549tYenFPRAFaj4P.jpg", "actors": ["Annabeth Gish (Beth)", "Steve Guttenberg (Barry)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
