Is the creature a leopard, a panther, a family pet crossbreed, an imaginary predator? Setting up a forest camp with an old acquaintance harbouring his own dark secrets, the trio fix 42 cameras to the trees and rocks, linked back to a computer nerve centre where nothing should go unnoticed as they take turns to night watch. But then they discover some putrefying body parts all neatly tied up\u2026 then some more. And before long they realise they are in the lair of a beast right enough, but certainly not one of the four-legged variety. For they have discovered a serial killer\u2019s playground and are soon to become his most wanted prey.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bY8dAVhn530m6dhxyGS593WKYWD.jpg", "actors": ["Melia Kreiling (Georgia)", "Nick Blood (Matt)", "Mark Bonnar (Fox)", "Olivia Popica (Vanya)", "Simone Kirby (Patsy)", "Sophie Harkness (Kara)", "James Lecky (The Beast)", "Fergal McElherron (Barry)", "Naseen Morgan (Alison)", "Jemma O'Brien (The Child)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [406582, 315899, 147879, 187276], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
