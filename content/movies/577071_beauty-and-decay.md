But beside standing in front of the legendary techno club Berghain in Berlin, he is also a well-known and skilled photographer. Long before the Berlin Wall came down, Marquardt portrayed the subcultural East-Berlin scene. His black and white photography illustrates it as voluptuous, laid-back, dirty and existential. Even if shot by daylight, his work is permeated by darkness, ecstasy and night.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ukzMWTYviCbIKHfhj9MVdyXAaY7.jpg", "actors": ["Sven Marquardt (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
