David guides us from his boyhood cinema experience of Australia in England, where he saw the first images of this strange and exotic landscape via the medium of film, to his migration to Australia as a \u2018ten pound pom\u2019 in 1963 and onto his present day reflections on the iconic themes that run through our cinematic legacy. All of this reflects a passionate engagement in a uniquely Australian medium. Parallel and at the heart of the series is the story of an industry whose growing pains David has witnessed over a lifetime. Alongside David, the protagonists of this history are the giants of Australian cinema \u2013 both behind the camera and in front of it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dW5Q9JPZbnojNghiaSiAZC4NjZJ.jpg", "actors": ["David Stratton (Himself)", "Dr George Miller (Himself)", "Nicole Kidman (Herself)", "Russell Crowe (Himself)", "Anne-Louise Lambert (Herself)", "Margaret Pomeranz (Herself)", "Geoffrey Wright (Himself)", "Michael Caton (Himself)", "Jacki Weaver (Herself)", "Todd McCarthy (Himself)", "Jack Thompson ()", "Sam Neill (Himself)", "Rachel Griffiths (Herself)", "Judy Davis (Herself)", "Bryan Brown (Himself)", "Leah Purcell (Herself)", "Sigrid Thornton (Herself)", "Sarah Snook (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "uoTbplWKvOg"}
