A young student, Ma Jie, who is sent to a tiny Beigao village in Shanxi Province and has the mundane task of watching over livestock during the Great Cultural Revolution. Surrounded only by the extreme boredom, he initiates a war against two donkeys. What ensues as a result, is an impressive feature debut by director Li Dawei who manages to infuse a believable quirky and black humorous universe within a realistically grim setting.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xEXhgq5GqNngS5bJSQAYBJUCm5b.jpg", "actors": ["Wen Zhang (Ma Jie)", "Bai Jing ()", "Hong Yue (Female Brigade Chief)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
