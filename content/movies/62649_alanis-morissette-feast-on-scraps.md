From writing/recording and producing \"Under Rug Swept\" and \"Feast on Scraps\" (the songs that didn't fit on URS), a show in Rotterdam during the \"Toward Our Union Mended Tour 2002\" and other cities around the world. The blanks are filled with personal footage ranging from the philosophical to the shameless (as an attempt to prove to my future grandchildren that I, in fact, did use the word \"boner\"). I send you much love and support in your journeys.
