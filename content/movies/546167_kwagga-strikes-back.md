Kwagga is upset when the UN sends a platoon of incompetent soldiers with the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (U.N.T.A.G.), to monitor the peace process, and ensure free and fair elections after the Nambabwean War for Independence. The U.N.T.A.G's American leader, Major Bradick D. Mackay and his second-in-command, Captain Zapman are offered a diamond worth a lot of money in the U.S., and they must pay 200,000 USD to Duan Robertse, Kwagga's competitive brother trying to buy a farm left to them by their dead father.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aa6DjQHH4CU7oVQiD3aPpvpXnxB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
