An eminently political opera in which power struggles are interwoven with family conflicts, Simon Boccanegra echoes the life of its composer \u2013 the man who championed the cause of Italian unification and overcame the loss of his wife and children. Calixto Bieito, that most Shakespearean of opera directors, brings humanism and truth to a work haunted by gleaming images of the sea.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qAbunGMZpCt4L3VyAMQgcuuVvFJ.jpg", "actors": ["Ludovic T\u00e9zier (Simon Boccanegra)", "Mika Kares (Jacopo Fiesco)", "Maria Agresta (Maria Boccanegra (Amelia Grimaldi))", "Francesco Demuro (Gabriele Adorno)", "Nicola Alaimo (Paolo Albani)", "Fabio Luisi (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
