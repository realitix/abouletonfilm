Their mission: clear the backlog of over 17 million pieces of mail stuck in warehouses in Birmingham, England and Rouen, France. They faced racism, sexism, and the Nazis. After dodging German U-boats, they arrived in Birmingham in February 1945. They were given six months to complete the mission in each city. Both times they finished in half the time. The last of the women returned to the United States in March 1946 with little fanfare. Their story was hidden in American military history until now. On November 30, 2018, a monument was dedicated in their honor at Buffalo Soldier Park, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eG1x8lJl9Vs0mIZX4ZvCKAVI8Ef.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
