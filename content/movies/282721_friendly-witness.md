In the first section of the film, he deftly edits a swirling montage of images - suggestive of loves gained and love lost--to the tunes of four rock songs. Fred Camper said, \"At times the words of the songs seem to relate directly to the images we see...; at other times words and images seem to be working almost at cross-purposes or relating only ironically. Similarly, at times the image rhythm and music rhythm appear to dance together, while at others they go their separate ways.\" -- Jon Gartenberg", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5GawzBQ4hFwoONJoS5iJEEfp1mI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
