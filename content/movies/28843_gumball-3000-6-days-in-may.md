This film captures the 2004 race, which featured Ferrari Enzos, Hummers, Caterhams, Aston Martins and other rare autos driven by an eccentric mix of skateboard pros, supermodels, Saudi royals and billionaires. The thrills abound as racers evade the law to be the first to cross the finish line at the Cannes Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7su2nl61bA73mO3Y6aqj1wHJ4Eu.jpg", "actors": ["Burt Reynolds ()", "Maximillion Cooper ()", "Alexander Roy ()", "Adrien Brody ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
