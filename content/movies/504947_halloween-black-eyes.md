The film is another showcase on mood and atmosphere, paying tribute to the original Halloween from 1978. Halloween Black Eyes follows Michael Myers as he stalks two individuals inside a neighborhood home. Once again McRae uses the same technique with slow movements and pacing to build suspense and atmosphere. The film's focus once again is the movement of Michael Myers and his presence in different atmospheric locations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eMyWJ4h5oQ0PjHhQgYGiTCvNzPG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
