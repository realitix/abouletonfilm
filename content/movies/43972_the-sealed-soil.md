Her persistent refusal of marriage proposals coupled with her unseemly removal of her hood causes her family to seek the help of an exorcist, convinced she must be possessed by evil spirits.  Made surreptitiously in 1977 just as the Ayatollah Khomeini regime was coming to power, a rough cut of \u2018The Sealed Soil\u201d was smuggled out of Iran by the director in a false-bottomed suitcase, and taken to the U.S., where she completed her final cut. The film has never been seen in Iran.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uLDx7kMil3pc1Oq5CDsKzsNVRW5.jpg", "actors": ["Flora Shabaviz ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
