Shinichi too detests his current life, but has no choice but be resigned to it, giving up his dreams altogether. During her stay at Okuhida, Kana and Shinichi both run into Kotani Yoshio, a native there who loves Okuhida very much. To Kotani, the mines and the rail tracks are the treasures of Okuhide, and he finds it unbelievable for anyone to think otherwise.
