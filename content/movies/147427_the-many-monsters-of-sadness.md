As the days pass, unexplainable things begin to happen. Any item put in the box disappears. Wishes, or something resembling wishes, start getting granted. People outside of the group begin disappearing. They begin finding messages in books and magazines; messages that suggest something far more sinister may be at work.  When her friends begin to disappear, Eleanor realizes she has to stop whatever is literally tearing her friends apart.
