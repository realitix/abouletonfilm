The stories of three nurses will open a world that is coloured by death but where the leading role is acted by hope of happiness in last days of lives. Death and nurses open same doors in nursing home but death will keep the last moment with itself. Until that moment the nursing home is full of life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z646TVqPKEvpKyyGfFKpVRtj3Nn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
