Syn\" there is the body of repetition\u2014not of tautology but of smooth resurrection; a body dying and being resurrected in a dance without suffering. A body of the desert, which is not deserted, but instead possessed by a force of attraction towards the sky, a force as strong as the one towards the earth. A body for the stars, the same one which plunges into the underworlds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c07btKVaKNB0WJML0ZXfBPD6xI0.jpg", "actors": ["Syn Gu\u00e9rin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
