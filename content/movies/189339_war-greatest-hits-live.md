Their first release in 14 years, GREATEST HITS LIVE, doesn\u2019t represent a new side to War, but that\u2019s not why fans will pick up the disc. Instead, the large ensemble, famous for its mixing of rock, soul, Latin, and funk, recaptures the sunny, organic feel of its \u201870s albums with high-energy versions of \u201cThe World Is a Ghetto,\u201d \u201cMe and My Brother,\u201d and \u201cWhy Can't We Be Friends.\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qD0HfVb0obHtQTbD8kAHHOecJdM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
