Rae's dark report, which described the crew\u2019s madness and cannibalism, did not sit well with Sir John's widow, Lady Franklin, nor with many others in British society, including Charles Dickens. They waged a bitter public campaign to discredit Rae's version of events and mark an entire nation of northern Inuit with the label of murderous cannibals. A stunning face-to-face meeting between the great-great grandson of Charles Dickens and Tagak Curley, an honoured Inuit statesman who challenges the fraudulent history, vaults the story from the past into the present and we are witness to history in the making.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pQM5oBRRIHDe3ikHl0lCO0BAA62.jpg", "actors": ["Rick Roberts (John Rae)", "Geraldine Alexander (Lady Jane Franklin)", "David Acton (Sir James Clark Ross)", "Andrew Alston (Sir William Edward Perry)", "Nigel Bennett (Sir James Graham)", "Alistair Findlay (Sir John Richardson)", "Colin George (Sir Francis Beaufort)", "Patrick Godfrey (Sir John Barrow)", "Simon Slater (Sir George Back)", "Guy Oliver-Watts (Charles Dickens)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
