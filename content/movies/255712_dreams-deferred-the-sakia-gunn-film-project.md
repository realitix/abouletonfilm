She was fifteen years old and called herself an Aggressive, an homosexual woman of color who dresses in masculine attire but does not necessarily identify as either lesbian or female-to-male transgender. Dreams Deferred depicts the homophobia that caused her untimely death and questions the lack of national media coverage of the murder of a Black Gay youth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7OT2lNOz0FmO20FBUQBx2xxoyz0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
