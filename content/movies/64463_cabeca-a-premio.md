In recent times, they've watched as the system that protected them for so many years slowly disintegrates. Mir\u00e3o Menezes lives at the mercy of the drug-trafficking industry, the ever-encroaching authorities, and the constant and violent power struggle with his brother Ab\u00edlio. Mir\u00e3o's daughter Elaine becomes involved with her father's pilot, finds herself pregnant and decides to flee with him after her Uncle Ab\u00edlio bribes them. Brito, the hitman sent to find the couple and finish them off, is ironically also victim of a love story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hkKk8mBDWNCsI3B51sfHr9q1akQ.jpg", "actors": ["Alice Braga ()", "Eduardo Moscovis ()", "C\u00e1ssio Gabus Mendes ()", "F\u00falvio Stefanini ()", "Ot\u00e1vio M\u00fcller ()", "Ana Maria Braga ()", "Daniel Hendler ()", "C\u00e9sar Troncoso ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "gScDQxzcEvw"}
