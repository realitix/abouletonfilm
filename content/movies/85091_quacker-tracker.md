Daffy's just the fool to do it. Daffy tries telling Speedy his shotgun is a telescope, but Speedy convinces Daffy to look. Daffy tries a snare, but it doesn't work until he steps into it to figure out what's wrong. An exploding girl mouse doll keeps finding its way back to Daffy. Daffy disguises himself as a giant enchilada, but the mice squirt hot sauce on him. Finally, Daffy rides a rocket, but ends up running into a train which throws him right back through the hunting society's roof.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/smxFKcjOqgdOWFfxFGyIWAiRxAE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
