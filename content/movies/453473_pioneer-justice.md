Jones (Al St. John) are looking into the strange goings-on in the town of Buffalo Gap. A ranger (Bob Woodward) has been killed and the trail leads to a gang headed by Bill Judd (Jack Ingram). There is yet another killing, young Al Walters (Steve Drake) is brutally shot by Judd after calling gambler Grayson (Terry Frost) a cheat. But the sheriff (Henry Hall) seems remarkably hesitant to arrest the culprit and may be taking his orders from a mystery boss, who operates out of a shack in the wilderness. Teaming up with Al's pretty sister, Betty and her Uncle Bob (William Fawcett), Cheyenne and Fuzzy go in search of the mystery villain.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xMYKKR07TYHTEfqKkiw3m500UxV.jpg", "actors": ["Lash La Rue (Marshal Cheyenne Davis)", "Al St. John (Fuzzy Jones (as Al 'Fuzzy' St. John))", "Jennifer Holt (Betty Walters)", "William Fawcett (Uncle Bob)", "Jack Ingram (Bill Judd)", "Dee Cooper (Henchman Criler)", "Lane Bradford (Henchman Joe)", "Henry Hall (Sheriff Peters)", "Slim Whitaker (Bartender Ben)", "Steve Drake (Al Walters)", "Bob Woodward (Deputy Jackson)", "Terry Frost (Gambler Grayson)", "Wally West (Buck Crowder)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
