This is a tale about one particular path, followed by two particular people, but this is not a tale about romance, this is simply a film about beginnings and endings. Daniel and Eve are a young couple in crisis. The film follows their relationship in reverse from the end to the beginning, starting with a break up. Daniel - a level-headed, well-meaning slacker caught between his desire to make something of himself,and his student inclinations to have fun. Upon meeting Eve at a party, Daniel finds her attractive precisely because she possesses the traits he does not. As their various differences bring them together, they are forced to acknowledge their faults, many of which are reflected in the other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ydWydCFMVww9EtST4EeLYLvweRp.jpg", "actors": ["Joel Hewett (Daniel)", "Sarah Calmus (Eve)", "Paul McCallum (Golden)", "Michael Coull (Michael)", "Simon Reynolds (Party Host)", "Stuart Tomlin (Party Guest 1)", "Jacob Duane (Party Guest 2)", "Chris Bangs (Extra)", "Rory Broadhurst (Extra)", "Iain Ferguson (Extra)", "Katy May Ferguson (Extra)", "Kevin Fullerton (Man Walking Down Stairs)", "Andrew Golden (Extra)", "Daniel Hewett (Extra)", "Naomi Laing (Extra)", "Jason Leong (Extra)", "Jenn Samson (Extra)", "Greg Smith (Extra)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "XpbwzMJf05E"}
