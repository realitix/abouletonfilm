Filmed at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco in 2002, Jean-Christophe Maillot has revived the essence of the original Sleeping Beauty fairy tale by Charles Perrault. The well-known fairy tale has been softened and sentimentalized over the years by both the Petipa and Tchaikovsky ballet and also the Walt Disney animated film. Maillot essentially puts the sex back into the story, interweaving the fantastic and the natural; he constantly amazes us throughout this exceptional dance piece, which was honoured with a Nijinsky Award.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Bernice Coppieters ()", "Chris Roelandt ()", "Nicolas Kahn ()", "Carole Pastorel ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
