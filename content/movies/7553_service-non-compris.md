I then watched it. I've watched it before. I'll probably even watch it again. BOOM! This probably means nothing to anyone who's reading this (there's also probably nobody reading this) but regardless, it's quite a big deal.\r\n\r\nManaging to take something as mundane as one day in a repetitive dead-end catering job, and make it even vaguely humorous is rather an achievement. You should watch it and play the other-other \"The Game\" (sidenote: I lost the game) like we used to in High School. 'Cause I'm classy like that.\r\n\r\nSeriously though, and I can't believe my thoughts even as I'm typing this, but I honestly think Waiting... is an underrated American Comedy gem, maybe I'm just seeing that comparatively, or with the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia, but I really do enjoy the film.\r\n\r\n76%\r\n\r\n-Gimly"}], "recommandations_id": [9900, 15373, 10956, 39939]}
