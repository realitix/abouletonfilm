Upon arrival, Claire finds Christmas celebrations have been canceled by the town after a flood and the bookstore is in a dire state of disrepair. She immediately takes on the challenge to revitalize the store, but clashes with the owner, Andrew (Jamie Spilchuk), who initially rejects all her proposed improvements. Eventually, sparks fly as the two begin a budding romance, and Claire\u2019s infectious optimism inspires Andrew to join her in reviving the yuletide spirit. But everything comes to a screeching halt when Claire discovers that Andrew is planning to sell the bookstore in the New Year. Will the spirit of Christmas be enough to change Andrew\u2019s mind and encourage him to follow his heart?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7P0WpZM0DgcrbyQBKybBPf5cZVb.jpg", "actors": ["Alexandra Breckenridge (Claire)", "Jamie Spilchuk (Andrew)", "Jane Alexander (Mrs. Tumulty)", "Sarita Van Dyke (Parker Brecht)", "Stefan Keyes (Aaron)", "Brennan Martin (Fr.
