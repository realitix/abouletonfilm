The tickets to the live event in Los Angeles sold out in 3 hours.  Metamoris is the first submission grappling organization to showcase the world's best athletes in a submission-only format with one round of 20-minutes per match. There is no other way to win a Metamoris fight other than by submitting your opponent (forcing them to tap out), thus the only way to take the belt from a champion within Metamoris is by submission, making Metamoris more entertaining and realistic than traditional point system based grappling events. Win or lose the best only get better.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yLpWAuOB5Md5IpmYV91iZFfVwdj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "4pjNl57NHRs"}
