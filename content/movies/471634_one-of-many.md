The film takes its cue from Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks\u2019 visit to Russia in 1926. The story follows a film-obsessed young girl (played by Aleksandra Kudriavtseva) who arrives home, still dizzy with excitement. Because today was the day that she saw \u2026 Mary and Doug! And not only that, but: \u201cMary SAW ME!\u201d The inserted newsreel footage is cut so as to give the illusion of a special moment of eye contact between her and Mary & Doug. Her joy is palpable. \u201cShe\u2019ll take me to \u2013 AMERICA!\u201d And when the girl lies down to take a rest, she is transformed into a cartoon character \u2013 and the film enters an animated Hollywood dreamland.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Aleksandra Kudriavtseva (A film-obsessed young girl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
