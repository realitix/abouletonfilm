He goes to Merlin to seek his counsel, and Merlin begins a story of his own, about a young boy with strange abilities and visions. The boy, called Emrys, is feared in his village called of as a demon. Eventually, King Vortigern comes and forces his village to build a tower for him. However, the tower crumbles. His wizards advise him to find a demon boy and spill his blood upon the ground. However, when the boy is brought before Vortigern, he predicts that there is a pool of water beneath the foundations of the castle that weaken it. The workers find a pool of water and two strange stones, from which two beasts emerge, a white and a red dragon.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3HRkQ2yDMgWAU2odIzx8kstLBhK.jpg", "actors": ["Kevin Kline (Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
