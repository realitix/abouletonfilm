No wonder other great musicians such as Phil Collins, Dennis Chambers and Steve Smith consider him one of their biggest inspirations. This 1998 concert at the Manhattan Center brings the three drummers together with the Buddy Rich Band for a pounding homage to the master.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
