In love with another clerk (Kveta Fiolova), he is urged on in his pursuit by a commiserate executive. The story is told in a flashback sequence as the cuckolded Hrusinsky attempts suicide by gassing himself in his bathtub. The \"Murder\" of the title is not a murder as such, rather the murder that Hrusinsky remembers planning upon discovering his wife's unfaithfulness with his supposed friend and advisor. Both plots failing in his mind, he loses himself in fantastic reveries of his funeral and of hypocritical mourners. ' Deciding (perhaps) that this is not the way out either, he gives up the attempt and imagines a life of reconciliation and eventual affluence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pzU1kku8x7vjgnSKIKp2Jm6Y179.jpg", "actors": ["Rudolf Hru\u0161\u00ednsk\u00fd (Franti\u0161ek Pokorn\u00fd)", "Kv\u011bta Fialov\u00e1 (Alice Pokorn\u00e1)", "V\u00e1clav Voska (N\u00e1mestek)", "Vladim\u00edr Men\u0161\u00edk (Emil)", "V\u011bra Uzelacov\u00e1 (Bindrov\u00e1)", "Libu\u0161e \u0160vormov\u00e1 (Jindrisk\u00e1)", "Franti\u0161ek \u0160l\u00e9gr (Vr\u00e1tn\u00fd)", "Jind\u0159ich Narenta (Red\u00edtel)", "Vladim\u00edr Linka ()", "Vladim\u00edr Navr\u00e1til ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
