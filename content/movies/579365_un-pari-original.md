Max offers to bet his wife fifty pounds, even money both ways, that she will be the first to speak or make a sign after the acceptance of the bet. His wife accepts the wager, and the two young people allow their flat to be burgled rather than move or murmur. Max sits out the ordeal in agony, up to the time the burglar attempts to kiss his wife. Then, with a yell, he rises to punch the burglar's head. There is joy in the punch, but less in the drawing of the check.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Max Linder (Max)", "Paulette Lorsy (Lucette)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
