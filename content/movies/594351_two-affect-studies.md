In the first sequence, a tape measure marks a spot on the wall while the camera documents the mad, free forms of a rubber band repeatedly snapped into the air. The image is improbably set, to near-comic effect, against \u201cFunctional\u201d (1957), a tune by jazz legend Thelonious Monk. In the second part of the work, Perlman recorded the visual effects produced by the billowing wisps of smoke from two cigarettes left smoldering in an ashtray. Accompanied by Samuel Barber\u2019s willfully sentimental \u201cAdagio for Strings\u201d (1936), this sequence, like its counterpart, uncovers the surprising potential for emotion, humor\u2014and, ultimately, meaning\u2014that resides within the simplest of stunts.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
