But times are hard, and jobs are difficult to come by. When Bholanath loses his job, Ramaiya decides to find employment, and does so as a menial worker in the same mill his dad used to work. Ramaiya is very popular with his co-workers and they soon elect him as their new union leader. This puts Ramaiya in conflict with the Management of the Mill, headed by the owner, Kapoor, who has ordered that Ramaiya be eliminated post haste. But Ramaiya is determined to address the workers' grievances, and he gets himself framed for theft; has the police on the lookout for him, and so Ramaiya goes into hiding.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cJKi4dH4enkkCZAVwuJd7bznNhF.jpg", "actors": ["Rajesh Khanna ()", "Asha Parekh ()", "Prem Nath ()", "Rajendra Nath ()", "Madan Puri ()", "Sulochana Latkar ()", "Nana Palsikar ()", "P.
