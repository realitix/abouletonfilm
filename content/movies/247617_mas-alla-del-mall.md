These are some of the questions posed by an Ecuadorian filmmaker whose latest movie was a commercial flop. He embarks on a query to find answers to his questions and relief for his despair. His research leads him to a giant contraband market in the port city of Guayaquil, where pirated movies from all over the world are sold for one dollar each. Here, he discovers a number of Ecuadorian low budget movies produced by amateurs, with titles he had never heard of before: from action packed productions to evangelical melodramas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4uvDpDox31zfjcq2bFtrHwPAKzI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
