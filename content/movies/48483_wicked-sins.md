The breakup appears to have been about Luke's indiscretions with a female witness in a previous case. The victims are Jonathan Lawson, a fashion photographer and his current model and playmate, Shani Cassata, who is married to Frank Cassata the owner of Club Z. Kari Sims, Jonathan's assistant and former waitress/dancer at Club Z, becomes the first suspect by discovering the bodies. Then comes the twist: Jonathan appears not to be himself, but his twin Justin, who is supposed to reside in a mental institution. Det. Sara is sufficiently attracted to Justin/Jonathan that she begins to take liberties with her professional role regarding witnesses in a current case. We are led to speculate on whether Luke and Sara can work together despite their personal differences as well as Sara's distractions to solve the case.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gRDYQ3fhcdICYIDotkesCagGipj.jpg", "actors": ["Samm Croft (Sara Parson)", "Brad Bartram (Luke Gage)", "Nadia Foster (Kari Sims)", "Justin Kyle (Jonathan / Justin Lawson)", "Lorraine Sisco (Shani Cassata)", "Victoria Style (Kim Bassett)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
