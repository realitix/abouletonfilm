Based on fragmentary evidence collected - a broken video camera, a wide variety of cuts and bruises and a general idea of what was written in a lost notebook - it explores the intersection between femininity and travel, the manifold perceptions of the other, as well as the use of intimacy and kinship as tools for protection.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m4R0ZblQAo1D8h2gFVwMNuNOBpP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
