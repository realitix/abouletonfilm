It sends him into a downward spiral of paranoia and doubt as he fumbles his way through the theatre of the absurd that we call life. Using humour and a playful tone, the film examines the fragility of human nature, when our bearings get lost and our imagination takes over, highlighting our common fears, doubts, hopes and resilience.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3ubN3YOtpQF49raudz5QfeWNjlr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
