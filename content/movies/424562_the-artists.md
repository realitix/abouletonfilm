The interviews all take place in a studio, where the goal was to place the interviewees in a sort of job interview situation. The interviewees have many different nationalities and backgrounds and were subjected to a litany of questions covering the themes of work, art, satisfaction, wishes, creativity, study and their personal life situations. The goal was not to build a personal profile of each individual, but rather to present a forum to discuss each of the questions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sTvhSThfCur1MPk6C2On3FT2Lhp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
