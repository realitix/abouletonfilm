The film cuts abruptly to a playground. Color appears, sound sets in. Children crawl in the sand, adults watch over them, sitting on benches. It turns abstract. At the end a circle appears on the screen, again flickering strongly, like a beating heart. This is \u201cIncendiary Cinema.\u201d There is no such thing as a nice succession of images; the film is supposed to distress and disturb, and it also aims to create receptivity for images and viewing. It is a small, quite salutary shot before the main film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h4CyhRo1HugzQlki6OUyqLlcKXC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
