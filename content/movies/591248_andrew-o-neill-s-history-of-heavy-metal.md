I've toured it round the world, added a full-on death metal backing band, expanded it, honed it and even written a bestselling book based on it.  Now it's time to film that show, so I can capture the magic and then finally put it to rest.  Yeah, I could do it shit and just upload it on YouTube and hope some of you see it.  But that's not good enough. Not for this show. Not for HEAVY METAL.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
