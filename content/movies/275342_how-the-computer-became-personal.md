The documentary travels back to the Orwellian year 1984 and traces the last quarter century: between demand and need, technology and ergonomics, the cultural environment and frantic development. A timeline follows the most important stages of the computer to the present day.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
