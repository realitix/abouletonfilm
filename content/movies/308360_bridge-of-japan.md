Ichikawa's film presents the tragic plot of the young geisha who is unable to enact her love for a man publicly in any way other than a histrionic story of torment, a heart-rending tale of lovers being crushed by fate. Instead Ichikawa shows the contest of wills that transpires as two geisha, Oko (Chikage Awashima) and Kiyoha (Fujiko Yamamoto) fight for the top spot in Nihonbashi, the pinnacle ot the Tokyo geisha world. Nihonbashi is an elegant, if steely, exposition of manners. The young doctor, Shinzo Katsuragi (Ryuji Shinagawa), is the object of affection for both women, but appears to be more the choice reward for the plotting and thieving of these two early modern superwomen, than a lover they swoon over.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4fsGJsmmL0Oo53GgPSWbmZ04EIm.jpg", "actors": ["Chikage Awashima (Otaka Inaba)", "Ayako Wakao (Ochise)", "Fujiko Yamamoto (Kiyoha Takinoya)", "Ry\u00fbji Shinagawa (Shinso Kuzuki)", "Hiroshi Kawaguchi ()", "Eijir\u00f4 Yanagi (Shinpachiro Kasahara)", "Eiji Funakoshi (Shinpachiro Kasahara)", "Eiichi Takamura (Kiyoha's Husband)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
