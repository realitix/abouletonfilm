Exploring themes of transformation and identity, the film constructs various scenes based on her thoughts, feelings and imaginings as she reflects on influences and choices that formed her attitudes towards her gender dysphoria. A formally and thematically complex hybrid of photographic and cinematic technique, the film was shot as a series of high-resolution still images using slow shutter speeds. This captured motion was then reconstructed as an animated video sequence by editing the images together, allowing me to author scenes where actions can be accentuated by being lengthened, shortened or even entirely deleted.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
