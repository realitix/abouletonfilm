Yes, there is lust. I'm not a hypocrite. But my main discourse is the purpose of this body. To be very blunt, Father, we only live once. I want to understand and feel the use of my breasts, my vagina, my mouth, and all parts of my body. In my view, I can only move to the next level, on the so-called spirituality, once I've addressed the issues of my physical being. In my view, there is a need to destroy that physical being, our animalistic nature, before we can achieve true spirituality. Let\u2019s crush the animal in the man, Father. That\u2019s fundamental to me.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iWyC1d37nEe0b85UuIzYzXEBKP4.jpg", "actors": ["Angel Aquino ()", "Bart Guingona ()", "Dante Perez ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
