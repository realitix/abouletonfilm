Her tepid life as a jobless illustrator comes complete with roommates who harbor diehard hobbies that solidify their status as hopeless social rejects. These wallflowers run a tight, nun-like ship, but their no-men-allowed-not-no-one-not-no-how bubble is unwittingly burst after Tsukimi brings home a rescued sea jelly and a beauty queen... who's actually a guy. When the threat of losing their cozy convent inspires this glamour boy to turn the neurotic entourage into a portrait of success, will Tsukimi take her chance to bloom, or will she end up a hot mess?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9pQzLGQHzTUoTBrGH6ndLo8TAXA.jpg", "actors": ["Non (Tsukimi Kurashita)", "Masaki Suda (Kuranosuke Koibuchi)", "Hiroki Hasegawa (Shu Koibuchi)", "Chizuru Ikewaki (Banba)", "Rina Ohta (Mayaya)", "Tomoe Shinohara (Jiji)", "Nana Katase (Shoko Inari)", "Mokomichi Hayami (Yoshio Hanamori)", "Sei Hiraizumi (Keiichiro Koibuchi)", "Tomoya Nakamura (tropical fish store clerk)", "Kenta Uchino (Kashiwagi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [54201, 63210, 336055, 29657], "youtube_key": "6op_qxBc9RE"}
