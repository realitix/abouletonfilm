Amir is an escalator attendant by day and aspiring sculptor by night. Even though he has never sculpted anything before, he hopes to one day fulfill his lifelong dream of making a marble bust of Charles Barkley. Anne comes from a well-to-do family and just started law school where she spends most of her days studying. Against the odds they decide to move into a shabby 300 square foot apartment and try to start a life together.  But things don\u2019t exactly go as planned. The combination of their small apartment, their threateningly charming neighbor next door and unexpected visitors from the past make them realize that maybe they aren\u2019t as perfect for each other as they previously had thought.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i3AKdlgOFgwAVacLsB8lhVVnIiW.jpg", "actors": ["Stephen Gurewitz (Amir)", "Susan Burke (Anne)", "Amy Seimetz (Samantha)", "Alex Karpovsky (Tom)", "Alex Rennie (Brian)", "Ron Lynch (Mr. Dad)", "Bob Byington (Mr. Waldorf)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
