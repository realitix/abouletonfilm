One is my mother, Pauline Silvia, who was a Navy biologist in the early 1950's and was sent to the Nevada Test Site where she witnessed five detonations. After decades of silence, she is in a crisis of conscience about the work she did. The other woman is Emiko Okada, a Hiroshima survivor who was eight years old when the bomb was dropped. Knowing the work that Pauline did, Emiko offers her an olive branch with a beautifully potent message of peace.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eDvn1Kb3WxqeMPHNL74VY0cR58S.jpg", "actors": ["Howard Lukk (Voice-Over)", "M.T.
