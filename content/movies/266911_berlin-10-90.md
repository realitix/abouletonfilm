He goes to Berlin for 6 months, where he makes an hour long single video shot (for a festival) in the bathroom of his apartment. Facing the camera, the filmmaker thinks, alone, about the fall of the Berlin wall. \"I've already spent 6 weeks here. With all the events in eastern Europe, it was like a hurricane. Berlin is a city where you feel the biggest changes, where you meet Polish immigrants, or others, escaping. Berlin will become a very violent city. What happens in eastern Europe is a bit like the end of the civil war in the US. The North, and all it's power stimulated by years of war, took over the South, who has lost everything. And there is this German past, the war, on all levels.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tRxRUqR0RxqGlobGe1qyCUiBgd4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
