Davis takes his audience through a side-splitting, roller coaster riot of subjects ranging from The Hood to Hollywood, as well as hood-rats and heaven. From relationships gone bad to rappers gone rogue, nothing is too taboo and no one is safe from the knock-out power punches that only DeRay The Difference can deliver. Filmed in front of a sold-out audience at the Best Buy Theater in New York s Times Square, Power Play is DeRay's best uncensored performance to-date and will surely be regarded as a classic among the comedy greats.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xA7NkUxtokOOJkhQGaozKpvOZoH.jpg", "actors": ["DeRay Davis (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
