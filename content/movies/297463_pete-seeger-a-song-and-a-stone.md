Elfstrom's film was made when Seeger was still blacklisted by major media organisations because of his opposition to the war in Vietnam and one scene shows Pete with Johnny Cash, when Cash, who admired him tremendously, defied his network to feature him on The Johnny Cash Show.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
