There is a man in a nearby kingdom, \"Divine Physician\" Chang Po-chao, whom it's said could cure his epilepsy, but the only way to bribe the head of the border guard is with a new work by painter Wei Yu-pi. He, meanwhile, wishes to be paid in jade, in fact with a specific piece, which requires a thief. But Ting Yu-yu, the best in the area, claims to be retired, though his daughter Li-ting (Cheng Pei-pei) seems enthusiastic. And for the sake of secrecy, the archivists originally sent to recruit Chang don't even know it's on behalf of the emperor!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pA1RdbMmrjDyjdhfiLifDTOiuOY.jpg", "actors": ["Fu-chuang Chang ()", "Chieh Chang ()", "Chiu Ming Chen ()", "Cheng Pei-Pei ()", "Tien Feng ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
