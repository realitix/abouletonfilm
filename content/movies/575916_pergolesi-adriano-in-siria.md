His staging in Jesi's exquisite 18th-century Teatro Comunale Pergolesi includes the delightful comic intermezzo Livietta e Tracollo, thus following the precedent set at the premiere in 1734. A fine Italian cast and the distinguished Accademia Bizantina are led by the Accademia's director, Ottavio Dantone.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/71IBgwXq3a6Y4dgmQpENmYK2yy4.jpg", "actors": ["Marina Comparato ()", "Lucia Cirillo ()", "Annamaria DellOste ()", "Nicole Heaston ()", "Stefano Ferrari ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
