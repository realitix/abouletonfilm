Temple Thurston. Veteran British director Maurice Elvey brought years of experience with theatrical adaptations to the difficult task of filming a movie that spans centuries and strains credulity. Conrad Veidt stars as the Jew who urges Roman authorities to crucify Jesus and release Barabbas. As a punishment, he is condemned by God to wander the Earth for many centuries, enduring innumerable trials and tribulations on several continents.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/di2DfEV1TNXjDLaivMODPFoqJ4S.jpg", "actors": ["Conrad Veidt (Matathias)", "Marie Ney (Judith)", "Basil Gill (Pontius Pilate [cut from US version])", "Cicely Oates (Rachel [cut from US version])", "Anne Grey (Joanne de Beaudricourt)", "Dennis Hoey (Lord de Beaudricourt)", "Arnold Lucy (Andrea Michelotti)", "Peggy Ashcroft (Olalla Quintana)", "Alan Napier (Knight (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
