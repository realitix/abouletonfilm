The walled-in city became the creative melting pot for sub- and pop-culture. Before the iron curtain fell, everything and anything seemed possible. B-Movie is a fast-paced collage of mostly unreleased film and TV footage from a frenzied but creative decade, starting with punk and ending with the Love Parade, in a city where the days are short and the nights are endless. Where it was not about long-term success, but about living for the moment - the here and now.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/37Po82KjolBG1EA0NfGgTOyI7JE.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Reeder ()", "Gudrun Gut ()", "Blixa Bargeld ()", "Nick Cave ()", "Tilda Swinton ()", "Die Toten Hosen ()", "Die \u00c4rzte ()", "Dj Westbam ()", "Nena ()", "David Bowie ()", "Eric Burdon ()", "Christiane Felscherinow ()", "Martin Kippenberger ()", "Zazie de Paris ()", "Annette Humpe ()", "Notorische Reflexe ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
