The film lays bare the truths behind taboo subjects that are conspicuously avoided, or merely treated as sound bites, by the mainstream American media: \"Why do they hate us?\" \"Why do we hate them?\" What were the events that led to the 9/11 attacks? What are the politics behind the U.S.-Israeli relationship? Why is there a robust debate about these subjects in Europe, the Arab World and in Israel itself, but not in the U.S.? Valentino's Ghost provides a fresh inquiry which challenges the media's daily barrage of rhetoric and misinformation about our complex and vital relationship with this part of the world", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mhIfMeXZ54uAQuaIEJbCrZ5kjUS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "yb0Z_XErOgc"}
