In this devastating film, Lagoze assembles his own footage and that of his fellow combat cameramen into a never-before-seen look at the daily life of Marines from the ultimate insider's point of view. More than a mere compilation of violence, the edit ingeniously repurposes the original footage to reveal the intensity and paradoxes of war in an age of ubiquitous cameras, when all soldiers can record themselves with helmet-cams and cellphones. Combat Obscura revels in the chasm separating civilian from military life and questions the psychological toll war exacts on all that it touches", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A4BiG9G4s2EpWAnQtY6rbWiHc1Q.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
