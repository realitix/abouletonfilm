Quite an entertaining movie mainly as it displays much of the scientific thought at the time and along with other George Melies films gave birth to what we now call movies. </br>\r\n**Synopsis**</br>\r\nAfter much careful planning on a chalk board by what looks to be Gandalf a group of brave explorers are fired out of a giant gun straight into the moons face. The group then encounter bad weather amongst other strange phenomenon and soon after the moon men, weird hominid creatures who jump around like apes. Armed with only umbrellas and their wits, they quickly explode the first one they encounter into a mist and promptly get taken by the moon men to explain themselves to the leader. Natually the leader is not best please, seeing the leaders annoyance they burst into action and do what can only be described as some kind of slam drop on the leader and explode him into a misty vapour in front of his already enraged followers. They get chased back to their ship and fall off the moon back to Earth in the most hilarious way, celebrations then ensure back on Earth. Go on, you know you want to watch it!"}], "recommandations_id": [16367, 91745, 39781]}
