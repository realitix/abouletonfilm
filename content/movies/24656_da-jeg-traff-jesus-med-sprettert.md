The film takes us to Norway in the late 30's, where we meet a series of burlesque and humorous characters, whose antics convince Oddemann that growing up may be a bad idea. Yet Oddemann finds there are certain rewards to being grown-up, such as partying and chasing women, that merit closer examination.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3zIEDQL2M0hXxi2BKPmEtBEhRo2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
