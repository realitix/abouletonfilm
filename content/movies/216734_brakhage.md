While touching on significant moments in Brakhage\u2019s biography, the film celebrates Brakhage\u2019s visionary genius, and explores the extraordinary artistic possibilities of cinema, a medium mostly known only for its commercial applications in the form of narratives, cartoons, documentaries, and advertising. BRAKHAGE combines excerpts from Brakhage\u2019s films and films of other avant-garde filmmakers (eg, George Kuchar, Jonas Mekas, Willie Varela, Bruce Elder, and others); interviews with Brakhage, his friends, family, colleagues, and critics; archival footage of Brakhage spanning the past thirty-five years; and location shooting in Boulder, Colorado and New York.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s0r8nN6bKKcQfJJLqZwLJP92AZT.jpg", "actors": ["Jerry Aronson (Himself)", "Jane Brakhage (Herself)", "Marilyn Brakhage (Herself)", "Stan Brakhage (Himself)", "P.
