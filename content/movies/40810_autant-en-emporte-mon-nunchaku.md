He is absolutely nails in this film.  His presence is as of a beast and no man.  He is ruthless and brutal.  \r\n\r\nThe film feels like a 70s USA exploitation flick in a way, at least more so than a normal martial arts genre film.  It's got a funky soundtrack and is streetwise.  Fight scenes are really good and pretty savage in parts.  There's an awesomely ridiculous shot of a guy's head taking a fatal punch via x ray at one point. Sonny pulls a man's tackle off at another.  It's Sonny vs. The mob but they can't really be arsed with guns.\r\n\r\nPure entertainment and stands out among martial arts films.  There are also 2 decent sequels but this is the best of them.  Worth it just for Sonny's incredible screen presence, which kinda feels as though he thought Bruce Lee was playing it too soft!"}], "recommandations_id": [40812, 40813, 41378, 49967]}
