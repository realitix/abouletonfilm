Rated X for violence, nudity and sexual activities by paper people.  \"The film takes you into the repressed areas of the psyche, the dark regions of the soul. It is a trip deep into the self, beyond the limits of conventional morality where good and evil merge into one. There are no governing laws at this level of the mind and that is the terror and its fascination.\" -David Bienstock, Curator of Film, Whitney Museum of American Art, 1972", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
