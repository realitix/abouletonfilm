He drives around in a car that's one big ad for himself and occasionally makes the local news with some freak incident. When the film starts he has just burned down his trailer and caused a traffic jam. He then hits the road with a DV cam to capture real life.

When he meets a famous singer on the way and gets drawn into her story things get interesting.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Chad Smith (Ethan Wildwood)", "Lalaine (Norma)", "Giuseppe Cederna (Mulligan)", "Stanley B.
