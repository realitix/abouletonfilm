Using original and archive footage and covering over fifteen years as a group, Pansy Division: Life in a Gay Rock Band is a fast-paced, intimate and humorous account of one of rock's most fearless acts. From their first days in San Francisco's underground music scene to a full-fledged stadium tour with Green Day and beyond, founding members Jon Ginoli and Chris Freeman overcome increasingly difficult line-up changes, prejudice and near-poverty to keep the band together and create music that has truly made a difference.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8kSEXy7c83KabuLPz1h5TeuO5cM.jpg", "actors": ["Jon Ginoli (Himself)", "Chris Freeman (Himself)", "Larry Livermore (Himself)", "Jello Biafra (Himself)", "Rob Halford (Himself)", "Billie Joe Armstrong (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "FvbRoN1IDSQ"}
