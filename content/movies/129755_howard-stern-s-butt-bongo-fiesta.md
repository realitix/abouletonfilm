Howard was doing all kinds of \"butt-bongoing\" at the time and the title skit on the video is a send-up of Hispanic dance shows, with your host \"Howard Estern.\" The video also features Jessica Hahn in the 3-D skit \"Jungle Man\", \"Guess Who's the Jew\" with Kurt Waldheim, Jr. and KKK-guy Daniel Carver, see Capt. Janks go on a date with John DeBella's wife (which Howard predicted would happen in his battle with DeBella in Philadelphia), the \"Gross Video Contest\" winners, Boy-Gary dressed as an ape and eating his baby doody, the classic \"Tribute to Vagina,\" and you get to tag along on a real, live, lesbian dial-a-date. Many consider this to be Howard's best video of all. Exact sales figures were never released, but the best guess-timates were that \"Butt Bongo Fiesta\" sold about 300,000 copies with virtually no advertising except for Howard pushing it on the show.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/leIBXafNVj8IfPI2sGQri9JOjr0.jpg", "actors": ["Howard Stern (Himself)", "Robin Quivers (Herself)", "Jackie Martling (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
