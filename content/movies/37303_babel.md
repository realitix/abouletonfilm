However, when the humans built a huge tower to taunt God, he became angry and drove the Babels underground, while scattering the humans to the corners of the Earth and giving them different languages to keep them separate. Thousands of years later, three Babels are searching underground for the Babel Stone presented to them by God when they lose the map -- which is soon snapped up by a dog, who presents it to his master, an advertising man named Patrick. The Babels are desperate to recover the map, and they recruit Patrick's son David to help them find it (and the Babel Stone) before the evil Nemrod can steal the stone and claim its powers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fpUHOJGRUDdmPrtVXPYzznDLCP5.jpg", "actors": ["Mitchell David Rothpan (David Carat)", "Maria de Medeiros (Alice)", "Tch\u00e9ky Karyo (Nemrod)", "Michel Jonasz (Patrick Carat)", "Bronwen Booth (Mathilde)", "Sheena Larkin (Mrs; Karlov)", "Garry Robbins (Wasco)", "Maxim Roy (Fanny Carat)", "Mark Camacho (Bexter)", "Nagui Fam (M.
