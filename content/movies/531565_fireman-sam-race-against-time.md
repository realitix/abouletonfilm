Gareth is taking the Science class to see the Aurora Borealis but, while preparing Bessie, accidentally trips, knocks off the brake and tumbles from the train. As a cabin fire also breaks out, Gareth watches in horror as the train speeds off without a driver and the children on-board! The fire crew is called but their path is blocked by snow and ice and so Sam makes a bold decision, leaping from the helicopter to ski towards the runaway train. It\u2019s a Race Against Time to stop the train before it reaches the end of the line!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/asSxVH0Wc6mjmBUiX2pqyIwj85x.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
