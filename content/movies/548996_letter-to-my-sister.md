The Islamists forced women, on pain of death, to wear the hijab or stop working. It was the first time a feminist woman paid with her life.  Nabila wrote a letter to her sister Habiba in 1994. This documentary is her answer. In 2006 Habiba comes back to the place to restore her sister\u2019s memory, her point of view, the day of her death and the political moment Algeria was going through at that time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t76K95HZ6kc6PQ4MJKnT8RddvMX.jpg", "actors": ["Nabila Djahnine (Herself)", "Malika Bouhadef (Herserf)", "Danielle Maoudj (Herself)", "Farida Mobarek (Herself)", "Notara Mobarek (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Dzg04IGVCys"}
