It was the most contaminated, and therefore the most dangerous, place in the zone. The remains of the roof coating of the 4th reactor. The operation on decontaminating the roof lasted more than five months. We will tell about only two days. About the most important two days in the life of an explorer - dosimetrist Valeriy Starodumov. He participated in this operation until it was over. He himself came out to the roof and led people there. He himself planted the \"victory banner\" at the level of 75 meters, as the signal for the zone: the roof coating has been decontaminated! Now, 25 years later, Valeriy Starodumov comes back to the zone. Now Chernobyl is a tourist object. But not for him...", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gYJKdUHxr3qNb6Vu2lyUfz8LESF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
