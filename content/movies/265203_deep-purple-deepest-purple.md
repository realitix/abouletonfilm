It features the original hits of Deep Purple before their 1984 reunion. Aided by a TV advertising campaign it would become Purple's third UK #1 album.\r It was at one point the longest album ever released as a single LP, but it was overtaken by Def Leppard's Hysteria album in 1987.\r This also marked the debut of \"Demon's Eye\" for the North American release, where it was replaced by \"Strange Kind of Woman\" on Fireball.\r All songs from this album later appeared on Rhino's The Very Best of Deep Purple, along with 3 additional songs.\r All titles composed by Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Gillan, Roger Glover, Jon Lord, Ian Paice, except where indicated", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hw9KyHEuJ8lNfO6ocYiMvyJiP3X.jpg", "actors": ["Ritchie Blackmore (Himself - Guitar)", "Ian Gillan (Himself - Vocals)", "Roger Glover (Himself - Bass)", "Jon Lord (Himself - Organ, Keyboards, Hammond Organ, Backing Vocals)", "Rod Evans (Himself - Vocals)", "Ian Paice (Himself - Drums and Percussion)", "Nick Simper (Himself - Bass, Backing Vocals)", "David Coverdale (Himself - Lead Vocals)", "Glenn Hughes (Himself - Bass, Vocals)", "Tommy Bolin (Himself - Guitar)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
