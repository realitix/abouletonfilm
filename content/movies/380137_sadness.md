One story follows Yang's pilgrimage into the heart of the North Queensland sugar cane fields as he investigates the murder of his uncle Fang Yuen. The other is a series of moving portraits of the many friends and lovers Yang has lost to AIDS. Director Tony Ayres skillfully weaves these two separate stories together creating a powerful testament to family, friends, love and loss. Cinematography by Tristan Milani. Narrated by William Yang.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/35XtZ0BM9IMZwbtVkRZJtZEWsTT.jpg", "actors": ["Linden Goh (Red Hand)", "William Yang ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
