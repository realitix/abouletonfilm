The movie follows three teens growing up in 1980's New York. Pinky, Mars and Martha all three girls share a common thread of trajedy , pain and abandonment. Gripping in its raw and intimitate protrayal of the girls everyday lives. Girltalk is a must see movie. This is truly one of the rarest forms of the beauty and heartbreaking tale of survival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/npvtvbcCrhZKsfAgJgXnqRH7iO8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
