None of them have a Dutch residence permit, and that's a concern for Lydia. What if her parents have to go back to their home countries? Who will she have to go with? While her father prepares the food, Lydia asks him whether he's scared. Of course he is, he admits, \"But I'm not going anywhere. This is my country.\" That's exactly the way Lydia thinks, too.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jh8jJb7fXybleqKdZgDQGOpy5HP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
