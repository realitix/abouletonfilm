Profit margins are very low, the financier has his own troublesome ideas about the kind of tape he wants produced, the company office isn't an ideal environment for child-minding, and the job constantly throws up new challenges - like shopping for bondage gear or devising the special visual effects for a 'golden shower' scene. On top of everything else, Kayama is heading for a mid-life crisis. The rediscovery of his unfinished student film crystallizes his general sense of dissatisfaction, and leads him to rethink his life and work, to the chagrin of many of his friends, colleagues, and family members.  Mochizuki's quasi-autobiographical d\u00e9but feature observes both the workings of the porn sub-culture and the spiritual problems of its central character.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v2lX1zErJhR7ngZ6jQ0LpRdrqPz.jpg", "actors": ["Hitoshi Ishikawa ()", "Yasuko Yagami ()", "Bang-ho Cho ()", "Yumi Iori ()", "Sabu Kawahara ()", "Junko Miyashita ()", "Third Nagashima ()", "Masayoshi Nogami ()", "Masahiro Sat\u00f4 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
