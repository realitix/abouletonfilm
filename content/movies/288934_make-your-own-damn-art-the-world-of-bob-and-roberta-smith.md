He occupies a unique position in the art world as an outsider who is a Trustee of the Tate Gallery, an artist whose work appears in The Guardian and also a school on the East End. What distinguishes Bob from mainstream contemporary art is his commitment to the idea that art is a vital part of democracy, and that art itself must be democratic. The film follows Bob over 3 years providing a unique insight into one of Britain's most important artists at work reflecting on art and the role it plays in society today.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
