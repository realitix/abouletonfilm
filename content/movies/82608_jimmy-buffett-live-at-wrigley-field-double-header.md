Held over Labor Day weekend, 2005, the concerts themselves (a daytime show occupies one disc, with a nighttime set on the second) are standard Buffett fare--i.e., another opportunity for the above-named \"Parrotheads\" to pah-tay--but as the singer-songwriter frequently observes, the venue is something special. Before Buffett arrived, concerts on the sacred ground known as \"the friendly confines\" were as rare as Cub victories in the World Series (the team's last world championship, in 1908, preceded the opening of Wrigley Field by some six years), and Buffett, a onetime Chicago resident and longtime Cubs fan, is clearly thrilled to be there.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sUvPpt85q4f9wTeksdbfzhtEsNy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
