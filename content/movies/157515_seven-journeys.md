K\u00e4utner uses the framing device of an automobile whose various owners serve as the film\u2019s protagonists and initiate its episodic structure. The characters represent an interesting cross-section of the German people including a deserting soldier, a Jewish couple and a composer who has been labeled as subversive. During a time when most Germans wanted to forget the past, K\u00e4utner eschewed the controlled setting of the UFA studios and chose to film in the bombed out streets of Berlin, crafting a humanistic rendering of recent history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yEdB9gNbocZNQBaVOkK16lmrpTY.jpg", "actors": ["Erich Schellow (Karl)", "Gert Schaefer (Willi)", "Winnie Markus (Sybille)", "Werner Hinz (Steffen)", "Karl John (Peter Keyser)", "Carl Raddatz (Josef)", "Alice Treff (Elisabeth Buschenhagen)", "Franz Schafheitlin (Wolfgang Buschenhagen)", "Hans Nielsen (Wolfgang Grunelius)", "Ida Ehre (Sally Bienert)", "Margarete Haagen (Baronin von Thorn)", "Erica Balqu\u00e9 (Dorothea Wieland)", "Hans Mahnke (Niginski)", "Erwin Geschonneck (Schmitt)", "Isa Vermehren (Erna)", "Willy Maertens (Wilhelm Bienert)", "Bettina Moissi (Marie / 7)", "Erich Weiher ()", "Gisela Tantau ()", "Hermann Schomberg ()", "Kurt Meister ()", "Hermann Speelmans ()", "Fritz Wagner ()", "Franz Weber ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
