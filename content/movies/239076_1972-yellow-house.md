I only added this because I wanted to log it on Letterboxd. Do not, DO NOT watch. Please. If I can prevent at least one person from seeing this tumor of a movie, then I can die happy. This isn't even a funny bad movie. You want an enjoyably bad movie? Go watch a post-2000's Seagal film. This isn't that. This is just vomit-inducing, shaky-cam, too-many-effects, terrible audio garbage. And to top it all of, the film culminates in footage TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM GRAVE ENCOUNTERS. Leave this alone. -2/10."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "UHVQOi4AR64"}
