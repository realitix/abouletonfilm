The premise has legendary gunslinger Django (Hunt Powers) recounting some of his greatest adventures to a rapt Wild Bill Hickock (Gerardo Rossi as Jerry Ross) in a saloon. The stories which Django tells are entire scenes from such Fidani films as Arrivano Django e Sartana... E la Fine! (1970), Inginocchiati Straniero... i Cadaveri non Fanno Ombra (1971), and Quel Maledetto Giorno d'Inverno Django e Sartana... all'Ultimo Sangue (1971). Fidani regulars Gordon Mitchell, Dennis Colt and Lucky McMurray also appear.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n7t2Bke0G9C9oO3IaMrcR9JRRzc.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Betts (Django/Halleluia)", "Gordon Mitchell (Buck/Butch Bradley)", "Dino Strano (Dean/Bobby O'Neil/El Zorro)", "Simonetta Vitelli ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
