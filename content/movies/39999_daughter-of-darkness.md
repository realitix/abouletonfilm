The enigma facing a young woman is the identity of her father. Unfortunately for her, she becomes drawn into a small Romanian underworld of brooding menace, darkness, torture chambers, and bizarrely over make-over'ed vampires. The moody undertones and well chosen locations are certainly a bonus, as is the comically funny finale.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/itI9vuavkkiVLEpfitgrWaBTCwI.jpg", "actors": ["Anthony Perkins (Anton)", "Mia Sara (Katherine Thatcher)", "Jack Coleman (Devlin)", "Robert Reynolds (Grigore)", "Dezs\u0151 Garas (Max)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [29429, 80775, 315379, 404211], "youtube_key": "M3G8jdCTZsI"}
