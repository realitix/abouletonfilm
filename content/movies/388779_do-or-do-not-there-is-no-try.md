Literally, his right hand man, puppeteer Dave Barclay. Dave helped us, along with Toby (Jabba\u2019s left arm), Mike Edmonds (tail) and John Coppinger (animatronic engineer) to reconstruct just how it was inside that filthy Hutt. And of course it couldn\u2019t have been done without the amazing work of Eletrographica aka Pete Starling, who rendered all that information into a multilayered illustration.\r Dave was so impressed with the Jabba documentary that he asked if I would consider doing one on Yoda. Dave aged just 19 in 1979 was involved in building and puppeteering Yoda for The Empire Strikes Back. After a few email exchanges, Dave kindly found time between his work on The Muppet Show for an interview.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rYk6AC7s4e91RwICVn8CkRR0zm3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
