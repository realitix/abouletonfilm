He lives with Gastone, his dog-friend,who, after a week of loneliness, can't wait to go out, for instance to the movies, and have fun. Gastone as a matter of fact is a passionate fan of movies, television and heroes' books. He always compares Rossi with them and nags with a petulant : \"Rossi, Rossi, if you only were...braver, stronger, richer...\". His continuous complaints push Rossi to identify himself with those heroes; throughout the film we will meet Rossi-Tarzan, Rossi-Astronaut, Rossi-Sherlock Holmes, Rossi-Zorro, Rossi-Hollywood actor, Rossi-scientist, Rossi-Lancelot, Rossi-Aladdin. Eight fantastic adventures in which Rossi, along with faithful Gastone, relishes the joy of being a hero.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o8FSFSj4SExrJG2VtyEtSXMB7k9.jpg", "actors": ["Gianfranco Mauri (Gastone (voice))", "Giuseppe Rinaldi (Signor Rossi (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
