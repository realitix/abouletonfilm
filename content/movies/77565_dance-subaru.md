After Kazuma's death from a hereditary illness, dancing became Subaru's only happiness and she yearns to lose herself in dance. Her life takes a dramatic turn when she runs into cabaret owner Isuzu, who recognizes the talent in Subaru and trains her in her nightspot. But to become a professional ballerina, Subaru has to overcome harsher challenges than merely satisfying the cabaret drunkards. Spurred on by her rivaling dance companions, Subaru enters an international dance competition, to vie for recognition and a scholarship to any top ballet company in the world. Subaru and her companions soon discover that there are more to compete than the championship, and tests of friendship, betrayal and self-worth come one after another. Gradually the youngsters learn about themselves as dancers, as persons and as friends.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5a5pllX4LcGErNJslBmuvlsGRnY.jpg", "actors": ["Meisa Kuroki (Subaru)", "Go Ah-ra (Rizu Park)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [88651, 106973, 123615, 352037], "youtube_key": "cT-lk1qFMz4"}
