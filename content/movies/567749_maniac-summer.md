It is a sprawling triptych without a beginning or end and with no specific subject or topic. The camera is positioned in front of a window and left running. It observes movements, registers noises coming from the street or nearby park, captures Chantal Akerman going about her business in her apartment: smoking, working, talking on the telephone. Fragments from the artist\u2019s everyday life are featured in the installation\u2019s central video, while the adjoining panels are more symbolically charged; in them, various images from the former have been isolated, modified and repeated. These abstract afterimages act as a kind of memory, looking back to the images in the installation\u2019s centrepiece as so many shadows of its reality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eLQSLAyZpKRWKFcN7UGBtlFIyZR.jpg", "actors": ["Chantal Akerman ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
