Flitting to and fro, thousands fly in gyroscopic unison. Scientists still don\u2019t know how the birds avoid colliding with one another in these elaborately choreographed murmurations. This short film makes no attempt to explain the winged ritual. No voiceover interrupts the flow. No score intrudes upon the birds\u2019 own song. The majestic ornithological swirl speaks for itself. As the black ribbon of flight careens back and forth across the evening sky, one truth emerges: This flying isn\u2019t an act of necessity. It\u2019s an act of sublime artistic expression.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4sOFPGInJ5SXHW09NNgX8UbclT9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
