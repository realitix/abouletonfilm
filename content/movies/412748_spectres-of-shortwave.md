For almost 70 years the RCI shortwave towers broadcast around the world. Due to budget cuts, the site was decommissioned in 2012 and dismantled in 2014. Examining themes of identity and memory, the film captures images of the towers over four seasons in various weather conditions, accompanied by the voices of residents and technicians narrating accounts of hearing radio broadcasts emanate from their household appliances.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o4vL5HJuQfuycGObIv8zFvnX09o.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
