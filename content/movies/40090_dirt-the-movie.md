The Movie", "slug_title": "dirt-the-movie", "date": "2009-08-07", "genre": ["Documentaire"], "score": "6.0/10", "synopsis": "A look at man's relationship with Dirt. Dirt has given us food, shelter, fuel, medicine, ceramics, flowers, cosmetics and color --everything needed for our survival. For most of the last ten thousand years we humans understood our intimate bond with dirt and the rest of nature. We took care of the soils that took care of us. But, over time, we lost that connection. We turned dirt into something \"dirty.\" In doing so, we transform the skin of the earth into a hellish and dangerous landscape for all life on earth. A millennial shift in consciousness about the environment offers a beacon of hope - and practical solutions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nNR8M53t2AuV4v13c6iXJMTZUFh.jpg", "actors": ["Jamie Lee Curtis (Herself)", "Bill Logan (Himself)", "Andy Lipkis (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
