Told simply, in language even the youngest family members will understand, the story begins with three young trees who dream - as all children do - of doing big deeds.  When the woodcutters come, the trees each find that the reality of their existence doesn't match their dreams... and yet...  This touching story contains a simple lesson about God's Plan for every life, told in a way that will touch hearts. Narrated by Hal Holbrook.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lgbKbHZ0P9lrLtiq4RfmsTKWjBt.jpg", "actors": ["Hal Holbrook (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
