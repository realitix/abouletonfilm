On its deepest level, it is a commentary on God;s willingness to punish sinners-and on His capacity for forgiveness. Now you can share this wonderful story with your entire family. The story begins when Jonah is a mere boy.  The forces of the Assyrian Empire have been terrorizing Jonah and his people-and Jonah quickly grows to hate them. He vows that he will one day take his revenge. But years later, God asks Jonah to go and preach to the Assyrians. If Jonah convinces them to renounce their sinful ways, God will forgive them. Jonah, of course, wants them to suffer; he wants them to feel the Lord's wrath. And so he foolishly tries to run away.  Needless to say, God catches up with him. And when He does, Jonah learns a series of important lessons about the power of God's wrath, and the power of His love for all mankind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6kkfTqveGixI85aYssmprXUy8bK.jpg", "actors": ["Charlton Heston (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
