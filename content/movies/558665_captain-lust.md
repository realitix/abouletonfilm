This cinematic extravaganza was shot on location on a tropical Island and aboard the old, beautiful brigantine vessel, \"Black Swan.\" The film tells the story of how Handsome Jack and his sweet sister, Anne, assume secret identities to prove that Captain Lust was responsible for the death of their father, The Count of Monte Cristo.
