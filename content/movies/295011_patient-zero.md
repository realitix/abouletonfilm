There are things in _Patient Zero_ that were new to me, and new or not, Stanley Tucci was great. But some nuggets of originality in a genre that often lacks it is not the same as a movie being **good**. And _Patient Zero_ does have some really dumb things. I had an okay time with it, but I don't think I'd ever revisit it.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"}], "recommandations_id": [434520, 513857, 529649, 457685], "youtube_key": "W9uddyaqAPE"}
