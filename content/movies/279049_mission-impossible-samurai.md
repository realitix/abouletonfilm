But at the han, there is a gold mine. Suddenly, Masaatsu Naito of Yunagaya Domain receives an order to perform Sankin-kotai within 5 days.  Sankin-kotai is a custom that requires the daimyo to visit the shogun in Edo. Unfortunately, the time needed to visit the shogun in Edo for Masaatsu Naito is 8 days. Masaatsu Naito also learns he received the order because a high ranking government official wants the gold mine. Also, the expense for Sankin-kotai is high and the Yunagaya Domain is such a small han that it seems impossible to complete. Nevertheless, Masaatsu Naito begins an unexpected operation to complete Sankin-kotai in 5 days.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tow08OsC8jSzzc3HPNVRufNC1LC.jpg", "actors": ["Kuranosuke Sasaki (Masaatsu Naitou)", "Kyoko Fukada (Osaki)", "Tsuyoshi Ihara (Danzo Kumogakure)", "Masahiko Nishimura (Advisor Kenji)", "Takanori Jinnai (Nobutoki Matsudaira)", "Takanori Jinnai (Genhachiro Araki)", "Yasufumi Terawaki (Seiemon Imamura)", "Y\u00fbsuke Kamiji (Heigo Akiyama)", "Tokio Emoto (Hirotada Masuda)", "Ennosuke Ichikawa IV (Yoshimune Tokugawa)", "Renji Ishibashi (Terusada Matsudaira)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
