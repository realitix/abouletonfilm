One day, Cho comes across the corpse of what seems to be a child on a nearby mountain and he decides to investigate the case, thinking that this is his last chance to impress his boss. Cho enlists the help of his partner, Detective Lee, and together the two embark upon an investigation that will test their professional judgement.
