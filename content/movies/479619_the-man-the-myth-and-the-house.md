A tour of Ian's house is an adventure in art, antiques, skulls and dolls, all in perfect balance. Ian created various jewelry sculptures, a kind of collage with glass beads, brooches, simple jewelry and various toys, which were sometimes pasted into boxes with small compartments. His colorful art and cross-border life is captivating but not always easy to understand.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3naU2VgOGxTjo0oBKPXsK6zMykt.jpg", "actors": ["Ian Hellstr\u00f6m (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
