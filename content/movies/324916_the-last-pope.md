In the late 1950's or early 60's the Catholic Church added the 112th whose motto was given as \"Peterus Romanus.\" This presentation provides a summary of Malachy's prophecy, describes the reasons that Benedict XVI is the last Pope, the 111th, and the consequences for the church and the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bACPtEWZPWPEJ3OUvJjtX5idxKQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
