This group, which recently became co-ed, earned the reputation of being fierce, loyal and dependable--and tougher than their male colleagues.  Despite facing gender stereotypes and the problems that come with life on the impoverished reservation, the women became known as some of the country's most elite firefighters. The film focuses on four women from different generations of Apache 8 crewmembers who speak tenderly and often humorously of hardship, loss, family, community and pride in being a firefighter.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Cheryl Bones (Herself)", "Steffi Kinney (Herself)", "Robert Lacapa (Himself)", "Marjorie Grimes (Herself)", "Nita Quintero (Herself)", "Ericka Hinton (Herself)", "Katy Aday (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
