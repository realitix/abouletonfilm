The film offers an intimate glance into De Keersmaeker\u2019s meticulous methodology, in which a choreographic universe is built up through a careful study of musical composition. This intense creative process of continuously reshaping and honing, characterised by De Keersmaeker\u2019s inexhaustible longing for precision and detail, is reflected in the filmmakers\u2019 patient look at the work of the choreographer, the musician and dancers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hwV8Wnr2b77hpQQN5mdygRqAqbp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
