Its subject is Scorsese's friend Steven Prince, best known for his small role as Easy Andy, the gun salesman in Taxi Driver. Prince is a raconteur telling stories about his life as an ex-drug addict and a road manager for Neil Diamond. Scorsese intersperses home movies of Prince as a child as he talks about his family. When talking of his years as a heroin addict, Prince tells a story about injecting adrenaline into the heart of a woman who overdosed, with the help of a medical dictionary and a Magic Marker. This story was re-enacted by Quentin Tarantino in his screenplay for Pulp Fiction. Prince also tells a story about his days working at a gas station, and having to shoot a man he caught stealing tires, after the man pulled out a knife and tried to attack him. This story was retold in the Richard Linklater film Waking Life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wkO5AREOY70PEMxRxkvgRYDq1Ak.jpg", "actors": ["Martin Scorsese (Himself)", "George Memmoli (Himself)", "Steven Prince (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [130816, 274906, 48265, 91459], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
