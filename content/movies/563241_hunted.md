We see a girl deliver newspapers to a house from which a small child emerges followed by a nanny pushing a pram. They both walk along quiet streets to a local park - followed by a sinister man. The nanny rests on a bench while the child chases her ball to an isolated spot. A shadow looms over her. Her scream alerts the nanny who finds the man on the ground revealing the Emperor moth he\u2019s just caught.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
