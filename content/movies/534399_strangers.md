He has never wanted to get too close to people.  All this changes when he meets Norika, a beautiful woman who appears in his life almost by chance.  But she just as quickly disappears, leaving no trace.  Before he knows it, Tam\u00e1s has been implicated in Norika's disappearance by her sister Annika, who claims Tam\u00e1s had made a habit of following them.  Reality seems to shift based on each person's perspective, casting the nature of the crime into progressively murky territory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f1N3E2nHYiY0CY3tHSVysNTB4d6.jpg", "actors": ["Nicolas Batthyany (Tam\u00e1s)", "Jeanne Devos (Norika)", "Marina Guerrini (Annika)", "Roger Wolfer (Roger)", "Nikolai Bosshardt (Police Officer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
