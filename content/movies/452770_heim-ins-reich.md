Paradoxically, this attempt to incorporate Luxembourg into the Third Reich triggered the nation's self-awareness. Using mostly unseen archive footage, the film tells the story of the clash between ideologies: the Nazi vision of a 'German' Luxembourg, colliding violently with the idea of an independent Grand Duchy. For a people who where becoming aware of their national identity, this was a huge cultural shock. The emotional backbone of the film rests on the many testimonies of the people who lived through that tragic period.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bEa4x5fQfEEWjGyIopKbGMPlTZM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
