Here, wearing a tuxedo, he emerges from behind a curtain as if at a theater, gives a short introduction, and launches into the poem. The camera is stationary, and although Hopper stands in one place, his hands and arms, his face, and his voice are animated throughout. In delivery, it's a minstrel performance.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["DeWolf Hopper Sr. ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
