The film tells three seemingly unconnected stories in a trilogy of distinct segments. The first part is the story of a woman (Moon So-ri - Oasis, A Good Lawyer's Wife) who has to deal with her long-lost brother's surprise visit. After having been missing for several years, the brother (played by Um Tae-ung - Revenge) appears and moves in, with his new wife in tow - a much older woman, Mu Shin (Ko Doo-sim - More Beautiful Than A Flower). The second story features a searing performance from Gong Hyo-jin (Memento Mori) as a short-tempered young woman, who discovers that her estranged mother (Kim Hye-ok), with whom she has had a falling out, is terminally ill. Part three examines the relationship problems faced by a young couple (Bong Tae-gyu from See You After School and Jeong Yu-mi from Blossom Again).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gIjYHaP98yGEPpJd7KsPX4uifom.jpg", "actors": ["Moon So-ri (Mira)", "Go Doo-shim (Moo-sin)", "Uhm Tae-woong (Hyung-chul)", "Gong Hyo-jin (Sun-kyung)", "Kim Hye-ok (Mae-ja)", "Bong Tae-gyu (Kyung-seok)", "Jung Yu-mi (Chae-hyeon)", "Ju Jin-mo (Woon-sik)", "Park Mi-Hyeon (Mi-hyun)", "Kim Hyun-A (interviewer 2)", "Lee Jin-sun (Restaurant Student Patron 4)", "Ryoo Seung-bum (Joon-ho)", "Woo Hyeon (Platform Man)", "Jo Hee-Bong (Platform Searching Man)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [69493, 69391, 230883, 200976], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
