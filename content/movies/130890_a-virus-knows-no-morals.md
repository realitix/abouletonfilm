The owner of a gay bathhouse gets Kaposi's Sarcoma but tries to keep his mind on profits. An epidemic victim is harassed by a reporter on his death bed - he sticks her with a contaminated syringe. The government opens a quarantine called Hell Gay Land. Gay terrorists kidnap the Minister of Health. A black comedy filled with everybody's worst fears, A Virus Knows No Morals is Rosa von Praunheim's most controversial film to date: a savagely funny burlesque on the AIDS crisis. Irreverent yet deadly serious, the filmmaker covers just about every aspect of AIDS and its effects, as well as the rumors surrounding it. Since the 1960's von Praunheim has produced a provocative body of underground films, making him one of the New German Cinema's most original artists. \"Brave and Vicious - Armed Camp!\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lwZeFkIblGHiPkuPMuXZKTABro1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
