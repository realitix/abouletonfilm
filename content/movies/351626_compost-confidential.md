According to a Cornell University research report, eleven thousand tons of trash a day are discarded in New York City, and 15 to 40% is food scraps that could be composted. In COMPOST CONFIDENTIAL, handmade botanicollage film frames, saved from unrealized projects, were put in a compost bin, left for several weeks, then retrieved and optically-printed. In the printing process, the sprocket holes themselves, usually outside of the frame, were intentionally revealed as an element inside the frame. The soundtrack, recycled from an audio project, features interviews with urban composters at the Union Square Greenmarket in New York City.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uevSEA41CgfsRDTxZMGr7bM6BEj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
