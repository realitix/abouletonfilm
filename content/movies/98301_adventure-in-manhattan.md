The mastermind poses as a theatrical impresario and stages a war drama, replete with loud explosions, to divert attention from his band of thieves, who are cracking safes in a bank adjacent to the theater.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cXcWgoFtdUao4yRrCYWTA8aauD3.jpg", "actors": ["Jean Arthur (Claire Peyton)", "Joel McCrea (George Melville)", "Reginald Owen (Blackton Gregory)", "Thomas Mitchell (Phil Bane)", "Thomas Mitchell (Mark Gibbs)", "John Gallaudet (McGuire)", "Emmett Vogan (Lorimer)", "George Cooper (Duncan)", "Herman Bing (Otto)", "Robert Warwick (Phillip Rupert)", "Bess Flowers (Beauty Salon Attendant)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [97821], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
