After a three-hour performance in front of 200,000 people at Mexico City's historic central square, the Z\u00f3calo, the ex-Beatle proved that not only is he as talented as ever, but he is as eternally charming and energetic as one would expect from the former mop-topped demigod.  McCartney amped the crowd at the Zocalo by yelling \"\u00a1Viva Mexico, Cabrones!\" -- a sure fire way to get the crowd up onto their feet -- and made sure to pepper Mexican slang into a few of the songs performed that night. For good measure, Sir Paul also waved the Mexican flag.  During the concert, McCartney was joined by a traditional Mexican mariachi band for the Beatles' classic, Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, an evening highlight that will not be forgotten anytime soon by the masses in attendance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zjlfWWeMQdB8Y3CubMPXoRHCJCV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
