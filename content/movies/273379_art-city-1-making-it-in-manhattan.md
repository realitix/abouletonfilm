Artists, collectors, and dealers bring to life the art capital of the world, New York, as it plunges into the 21st Century. Presenting a cross-section of artists, the film discusses inspiration, aesthetics, and the meaning of success. With Louise Bourgeois, Brice Marden, Chuck Close, Neil Jenney, Elizabeth Murray, Ashley Bickerton, Gary Simmons, Ursula von Rydingsvard, Rirkrit Tiravanija, St. Clair Cemin, Ivan Karp, Jay Gorney, Matthew Marks, Jerry Saltz, Herb &amp; Dorothy Vogel, and others. From abstraction to figuration, from installation to conceptual art, from the privacy of the doctor's office to the posh gallery opening, Making it in Manhattan captures the reality of a special world. Music by Tom Waits, Don Braden Ryuichi Sakamoto, George van Eps, Piero Umiliani with Chet Baker.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6IHZTunKOxy2OoB9Rkj9rb5aTZp.jpg", "actors": ["Emma Amos ()", "Ashley Bickerton ()", "Louise Bourgeois ()", "Aldis Browne ()", "Maria Browne ()", "Chuck Close ()", "Jerry Saltz ()", "Dorothy Vogel ()", "Herbert Vogel ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
