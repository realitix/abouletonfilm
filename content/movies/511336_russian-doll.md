What the cops don't know is that like a Russian doll, one of the people they question is a killer hiding in plain sight, preparing to avenge a thirty-year-old crime by murdering a cast member on opening night. And what they also don't know is that if they don't act quickly, the kidnapped woman will die, too. Running throughout the movie is a subplot focused on the lead detective, Viola Ames.
