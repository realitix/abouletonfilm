From the moment Thoroughly Amorous Amy appears on the screen, jogging down the beach, through the park and across town so seductively that she ends up at the head of a panting, passionate parade a city block long, the heat and the humor never let up for a second. You have never seen so many beautiful people doing so much to so many in such a fantastic way until you've followed the crowd to Amy's place!!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/96evIodKOtMHG7Qgb0AdtIVwxU5.jpg", "actors": ["Tracy O'Neil (Amy Smith)", "Peter Johns (Brent Smith)", "Kristine Heller (Marge)", "Candida Royalle (Ellen)", "Paul Thomas (Tom)", "Dia L'Eclaire (Avon Lady)", "Mick Jones (Police Officer)", "Rock Steadie (Salesman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
