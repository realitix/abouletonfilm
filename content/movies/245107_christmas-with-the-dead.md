If only it weren't June and the majority of the population, including his wife and daughter, hadn't been turned into flesh-eating snappers by a mysterious atmospheric phenomenon, he'd be in pretty good shape. Driven by guilt in a race against the apocalyptic clock, Calving teams up with G.M., a wily ex-garbage man turned undead slayer, as together they attempt to deck the halls during the most magical time of the year. It's Christmas in June. And snappers be damned. . . The lights and decorations are going up.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9ztspeT2X7K2DCs3yHSL9qbgmdd.jpg", "actors": ["Damian Maffei (Calvin)", "Brad Maule (G.M.)", "Kasey Lansdale (Ella)", "Chet Williamson (Reverend Mac)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
