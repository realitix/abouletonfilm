Director Maria Augusta Ramos follows the trial against Rousseff from the point of view of her defence team. This is a courtroom drama that unfolds slowly: the appearances of the various parties gradually turn the proceedings into something akin to theatre. Inside the courtroom, grand emotions are played to full effect whilst, on the other side of the doors, lobbyists and supporters pace the corridors. Meanwhile, outside, in front of Bras\u00edlia\u2019s modernist government buildings, demonstrators are chanting like a Greek chorus. Only the main character, Rousseff herself, remains professional and aloof.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fKpmIMJHb92mtZuULzY3o7pzbrD.jpg", "actors": ["Dilma Rousseff (Herself)", "Gleisi Hoffmann (Herself)", "Lindbergh Farias (Himself)", "Jana\u00edna Paschoal (Herself)", "Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Cardozo (Himself)", "Eduardo Cunha (Himself)", "Roberto Requi\u00e3o (Himself)", "Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva (Himself)", "Jean Wyllys (Himself)", "A\u00e9cio Neves (Himself)", "Chico Buarque (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "OcoSy2KVg4s"}
