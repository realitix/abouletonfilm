Although Japan\u2019s defeat seems imminent, all of Masaaki\u2019s students are drafted in a futile last-ditch effort. In an attempt to give the young men some hope, he makes everyone promise that they will all meet again under the cherry blossoms upon their safe return. Consumed by sadness over the fate of his students, Masaaki devotes the next 30 years of his life to develop a new species of cherry blossoms that could thrive in any climate in remembrance of his students.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5Ln9oK26kAkob9tIcJMYrmF2s42.jpg", "actors": ["Takashi Sasano (Masaaki Takaoka)", "Koji Matoba (Seido Takaoka)", "Maki Miyamoto (Keiko Takaoka)", "Taisei Miyamoto ()", "Y\u00fbya Takayama ()", "Ry\u00fbshi Mizukami ()", "Su-yeon Gu ()", "Daisuke Nagakura ()", "Hikaru Makishima ()", "S\u00f4tar\u00f4 Mori ()", "Sakura Kimura ()", "K\u00f4tar\u00f4 Kano ()", "Kontakinte ()", "Akira Tanaka ()", "Mayuko ()", "Ky\u00f4ko Hayami ()", "Shinya Ono ()", "Gen Idemitsu ()", "Naomi Hase (Kiyoko)", "Hironobu Nomura (Kondo)", "Sh\u00f4ta Sasano (Masaaki Takaoka in his younger days)", "Maiko Kawakami (Shizuka)", "Masahiko Tsugawa (Vice-Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries)", "Yuki Kazamatsuri (Tsuyako Takaoka)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
