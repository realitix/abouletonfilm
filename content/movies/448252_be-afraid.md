Lying there paralyzed, trapped within his own nightmare, other-worldly beings visit John. They are entities which exist in the darkest shadows of the night and can only be seen out of the corner of one's eye. These encounters begin to haunt John, transforming to complete terror as he discovers the entities' sole purpose... the abduction of his seven year old son. In the end, John will uncover the town's horrific secret, a portal on his land, and make one last attempt to save his son before the shadow people permanently take him away to their world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ytkaL1wZcqgQKHLuU7Go3UxGpON.jpg", "actors": ["Brian Krause (Dr. John Chambers)", "Kevin Grevioux (Dean Booth)", "Louis Herthum (Chief Collins)", "Jaimi Paige (Heather Chambers)", "Michael Leone (Nathan Chambers)", "Callie Thorne (Annabelle Fletcher)", "Jared Abrahamson (Ben Chambers)", "Noell Coet (Nikki Collins)", "Michelle Hurd (Christine Booth)", "Sade Kimora Young (Emms Booth)", "Kevin M.
