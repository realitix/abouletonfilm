This stunning collection of color 3D photos includes Allied reconnaissance photos, a trove of images that documents the rise and fall of the Third Reich, and photos secretly taken by a civilian in occupied France. WWII IN 3D also features an actual 3D motion picture film shot by the Nazis in 1943 and creates a fully immersive, three dimensional portrait of history's largest and bloodiest conflict.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2GQo4USpO3qlL7mCrJID7weoQVh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
