At least, that's the way his rescuer Bruno (Bruno Ganz) sees it. Besides, Bruno needs such an overly enterprising fellow to help him pull off a really big heist that he's been planning for a long time. It takes some doing, but the boy and his girlfriend are recruited by the older man, who has been keeping a low profile by working as a gardener.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jfSgmNQh7FqURg9NViFlFfVlmK9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
