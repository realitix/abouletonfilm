He set out across country and desert to locate this uncle in Tucson. At the border he was unwillingly linked up with a small chihuahua. The story is of their experiences as they made their trek across the desert, some funny and others harrowing. They encountered friendly people to aggressive Javelinas. They never found Pablo's uncle, but in the end they did find a loving family.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/md9EJmemZV9J4im8yvzK1fJv2vc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
