Surrealist master Luis Bunuel is a towering figure in the world of cinema history, directing such groundbreaking works as Un Chien Andalou, Exterminating Angels, and That Obscure Object of Desire, yet his personal life was clouded in myth and paradox. Though sexually diffident, he frequently worked in the erotic drama genre; though personally quite conservative, his films are florid, flamboyant, and utterly bizarre. This documentary, directed Jose Luis Lopez Linares, tries to illuminate some of these contradictions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3Xky97HRNSoFxAQZ4p7W3bmelG3.jpg", "actors": ["Luis Bu\u00f1uel (Himself)", "Jos\u00e9 Sancho ((voice))", "Silvia Pinal (Herself)", "\u00c1ngela Molina (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [42143, 49571, 211021, 132136], "youtube_key": "u3vDtmvUn-U"}
