Indeed, the main location is Beaulieu-sur-Mer, a seaside village on the French Riviera between Nice and Monaco.\r\nItalian audience will perhaps recognize Paul Konrad M\u00fcller (as Inspector Mendoza) who played Fantozzi's \"megadirettore galattico\" in some pictures of the 80s."}], "recommandations_id": [92712, 45233], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
