Before they crash they shoot the weapon like a torpedo from the ship to some location on Earth. There is only one survivor of the crash, the least intelligent of the crew, who before they were attacked was using a highly advanced mop to clean the floor. He must locate the Deathsphere before the Ghastorians do. He gets confused for someone else and becomes part of a group having a beach party while the Deathsphere gets mistaken for a volleyball which some young people play with. The Maltrusian alien along with the Deathsphere go off with a group that separates from the party to go up to the mysterious abandoned house of the deceased Mr. Willoughby.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mmesrih30OovqXjfjQRsnQWP5EU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
