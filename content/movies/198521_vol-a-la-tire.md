The multitalented Stockard Channing plays a car thief with a penchant for elaborate disguises. She hopes to trade in her stolen goods and purchase a snazzy sports model for herself. Sam Waterston costars as a public defender who, much against his will, falls in love with the charming thief. Producer/director Jerry Schatzberg seems so certain of Channing's considerable talents that he feels a coherent story is unecessary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n7jgKYUoR50vM4GA5WMODuz7hei.jpg", "actors": ["Stockard Channing (Vurlla Kowsky)", "Sam Waterston (Le Clerq)", "Franklyn Ajaye (Edmund)", "Richard Daughty (Andy)", "Norman Matlock (John)", "Marvin Rosand (Policeman)", "Robert Lewis-Ferguson (Policeman #2)", "Betta St. George (Woman Guard)", "Evan A.
