He goes to see the stage of Ranko Mizuki, a star of an all-girls'-operetta company known as Asakusa Revue. Monzo notices a creepy man sitting beside him who keeps his head slumped down and does not even look up when Ranko appears on stage. On the way home from the theater, Monzo encounters another creepy situation. A dwarf (inch-high samurai) with a child-sized body and a grown-up's head passes right by him and is carrying a woman's arm that has been sliced off from the shoulder. Being a writer, this strangely enhances his interest of this dwarf and he begins an investigation about dwarfs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kD7uc32coWIIBacXzr9GTcxm97q.jpg", "actors": ["Lily Franky ()", "Shinya Tsukamoto ()", "Mutsumi Fujita ()", "Reika Hashimoto ()", "Kenpachir\u00f4 Satsuma ()", "Tomoko Matsumoto ()", "Tetsur\u014d Tamba ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
