As a result, she has grown into a tomboy -- contrary to traditional Japanese notions of femininity, she studies kendo, drinks sake, dresses in often outlandish-looking Western fashions instead of the traditional kimono, and is not as interested in housework as she is in literature. She also rejects the idea of arranged marriages and believes in a woman's right to a career and to marry for love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kCs25VTi84Q38cmOzRBfRERZcux.jpg", "actors": ["Saori Hayami (Benio Hanamura (voice))", "Unsho Ishizuka (Major Hanamura (voice))", "Shizuka It\u014d (Kichiji (voice))", "Yuuki Kaji (Ranmaru Fujieda (voice))", "Kenta Miyake (Ushigoro (voice))", "Mamoru Miyano (Shinobu Ijuin (voice))", "Kazuya Nakai (Shingo Onijima (voice))", "Takahiro Sakurai (Tosei Aoe (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "IuSjXWGXLYQ"}
