This short movie lasts for 10 minutes but those minutes were surely not wasted time. Short and very interesting.\r\n\r\nSoundtrack ? Environmental \"booms\" tensing you harder and harder by every breath-taking minute which comes ..\r\n\r\nThe story of a gangster who is paid back. The story of someone who we don't know but we begin to like. The story of a death.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the feminine character really adds a lot of credibility to the movie. The brief dialogues used help us get into the action.\r\n\r\nThat could be said for now.. for more, you HAVE GOT to see the movie."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
