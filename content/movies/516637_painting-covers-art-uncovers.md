Kriesche then paints over a glass canvas, the very invisible wall, between himself and the camera, just as he reappears in front of the TV monitor and delivers the same artist statement. After this, Kriesche paints over the glass of the TV monitor with blue paint, acting as a chrome key effect that slowly uncovers the original image of Kriesche on the monitor, now seeming to drip as the blue paint spills over and Kriesche delivers his statement a third and final time.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Richard Kriesche (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
