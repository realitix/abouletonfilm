Millard Mitchell plays the sheriff, an old friend, while Helen Westcott appears as his former babe. Karl Malden plays the bartender while Jean Parker is on hand as a saloon singer. \r\n\r\nThe movie starts great with a saloon confrontation and a chase in the desert wilderness. Too bad the B&W photography renders the awesome locations flat. \r\n\r\nFrom there the story turns dramatic and it\u2019s done well as we get to learn about the gunfighter through his conversations with peoples he\u2019s known. There are a couple of hokey elements but, for the most part, this is a potent Western drama. I didn\u2019t like the ending though; I think it was a cop-out and something better could\u2019ve been scripted. For one thing, a certain character wasn\u2019t a criminal (that is, if the dialogue is to be believed); he only shot others in self-defense, about 15 people, which is even illustrated in the opening scenes.   \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 25 minutes and was shot in California and Arizona.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"}], "recommandations_id": [35123, 28304, 20638, 60792], "youtube_key": "3z6Obp0rcuo"}
