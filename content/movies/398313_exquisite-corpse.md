As he leaves his world in the midst of this ritual he is infused with visions as his own mind attempts to filter and purify his fears and his desires. Juventino\u2019s myths, as torrid and exuberant as the geography, are often more concrete than his reality. The inhabitants aid his journey by performing rituals with the hope of understanding, pleasing and obtaining favors from the beyond. During the day these rituals unleash repressed emotions, which at sundown are liberated into lascivious celebration. His corpse, during the autopsy, unveils something more repugnant than his death, the submission of the living to it. This fantastical collective biography immerses into a dense mythological universe by narrating the life of this being in the process of unbeing, this character becoming this corpse.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vpB7EW0F3bccX2j5wqWPv86mVYs.jpg", "actors": ["Rossemberg Rivas (El Cad\u00e1ver Exquisito)", "Malado Baldwin (La Flor)", "Alejandra Palomo (El cuerpo 1)", "Cristina L\u00f3pez (El cuerpo 2)", "Ana Mar\u00eda Dur\u00e1n (Leoparda Corazones)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
