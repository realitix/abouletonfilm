Dean's film is a study of the ageing artist in the last year of his life. Merz is observed sitting in silence under a tree, a large pinecone in his hand. The film is ostensibly a portrait, but more importantly is a study of light in space and form in nature - central concerns in Merz's sculptural investigations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nlUdmvYEUXlNlpO4yCQdItknDof.jpg", "actors": ["Mario Merz (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
