However, just as in Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo and Juliet, the lovers are the progeny of two feuding families and do not have the right to love each other. Lucia, a magnificent flower shattered by the violence of a society of men, is embodied by South Africa\u2019s Pretty Yende, a rising star of the opera stage, in this production by Andrei Serban, conducted by Riccardo Frizza.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1OcN0J4JnuKGfVLdER264AAHjaG.jpg", "actors": ["Pretty Yende (Lucia)", "Piero Pretti (Edgardo di Ravenswood)", "Oleksiy Palchykov (Arturo Bucklaw)", "Rafal Siwek (Raimondo Bidebent)", "Riccardo Frizza (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
