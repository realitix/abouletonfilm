She feels affection but no love. Soon after, without design, she falls in love with Pedro Abrunhosa, a poet and performance artist. He also loves her. She keeps her distance from him, confessing her love to a friend who is a nun and, later, to her husband. Hunger for her love and jealousy consume him; she attends him as he wastes away. With his death, she can marry and express her passion, but what she does and how she explains herself, particularly to her cloistered friend, is at the heart of the film. Glimpses of convent life and of Abrunhosa on stage give contrast and mute comment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nmzZOERadXnf1AHNCdsv8PkmmKK.jpg", "actors": ["Chiara Mastroianni (Mme de Cl\u00e8ves)", "Pedro Abrunhosa (Pedro Abrunhosa)", "Antoine Chappey (M. de Cl\u00e8ves)", "Leonor Silveira (La religieuse)", "Maria Jo\u00e3o Pires (Maria Jo\u00e3o Pires)", "Lu\u00eds Miguel Cintra (M. da Silva)", "Stanislas Merhar (Fran\u00e7ois de Guise)", "Ricardo Tr\u00eapa (Intrus)", "Anny Romand (Mme de Silva)", "Fran\u00e7oise Fabian (Mme de Chartres)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [108548], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
