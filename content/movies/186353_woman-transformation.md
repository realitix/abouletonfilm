Mihiro Iwasaki (Anri Ban) is a model extremely preoccupied by how others look at and think of her. Then, her nails start growing disproportionately until they become killing weapons. Michiko Yamane (Mariko Miyamitsu) is an unsociable university student and part-time worker in her early twenties only crazy for a hobby. At night she becomes a rokurokubi (female yokai with an extremely long and flexible neck). Finally, Mana Saeki (Haruki Ichikawa) is a last year junior high school student with a very bad character and very distrustful of all her friends, who metamorphoses into a nopperabo (yokai without face).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9zMkMvHd1WRHxavZigGPHAgjRNr.jpg", "actors": ["Chiyoko Asami ()", "Go Ayano ()", "Anri Ban ()", "Haruki Ichikawa ()", "Hachiro Ika ()", "Mariko Miyamitsu ()", "Akiko Mon\u00f4 ()", "Miyuki Tanigawa ()", "Toru Tezuka ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
