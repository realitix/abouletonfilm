She's dangerous. She's a bellwether: a quiet leader who is well on her way to being her whole self. When they kidnap her to break her to make her conform, they discover that Joanne is something so much more than even she ever knew. Joanne is a feminist, one-room, one-character elevated genre thriller. It is a modern rite of passage story which most women have to go through to become a whole human being: How does one be oneself in the face of massive misogyny and hatred (both overt and institutionalized). It is also the world's first one-person film (a movie with only one on-screen character) that features a woman.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iaFxlT8dR8VdrGiw0mSeBQFWKDS.jpg", "actors": ["Alex Reid ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
