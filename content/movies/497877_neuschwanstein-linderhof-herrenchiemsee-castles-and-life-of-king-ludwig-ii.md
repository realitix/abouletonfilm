The myth of King Ludwig II is unbroken even more than 125 years after his death. The 85-minute documentary, released in 2012 with beautiful aerial photographs, provides detailed information on the genesis and background of the royal palaces of Neuschwanstein, Linderhof, Herrenchiemsee and Hohenschwangau. The high-quality film material includes the sumptuous equipment of all developed rooms of these castles. Historical imagery documents the construction of the royal palaces. It is impressively demonstrated how closely these famous buildings are connected with the tragic life of the Bavarian King. Written spellbound, the text, which is as informative as it is knowledgeable, follows the credo of the author: Only those who try to approach the king's world of thought understand how Ludwig II transformed his ideas and dreams into unique architecture. Last but not least, Ludwig's more than 30 original quotations give the viewer an insightful insight into the psychic life and thoughts of the equally lonely and unhappy king."}], "recommandations_id": []}
