Shukla, an auto driver from an orthodox Brahmin family, has never intimately known a woman other than the celluloid starlets he watches every day on the 4 inch display of his mobile phone. When his mother arranges his sudden marriage, Shukla and his new wife face the experience of more than 55% of couples in Mumbai: a new marriage, no experience in a relationship and a joint family love nest that offers no space for sex, much less a conversation. Their only respite is a line of old suitcases set up by his father to separate them from the family, a cell phone and a city of 18 million eyes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fsJQVbOrmwTGVH4BoPpAfGK0H6f.jpg", "actors": ["Saharsh Kumar Shukla (Manu Shukla)", "Taneea Rajawat (Lakshmi)", "Hima Singh (Rupa)", "Aparna Upadhyay (Mother)", "Loknath Tiwari (Father)", "Amol Deshmukh (Friend 1)", "Ganesh Kumar (Friend 2)", "Shahnawaz Alam (Friend 3)", "Sambhaji Sasane (Sunil)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
