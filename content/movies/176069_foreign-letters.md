Set in the pre-email era of the 1980s, young Ellie, newly arrived to the US from Israel, anxiously waits for letters from her best friend back home. Suffering from homesickness, language difficulties and rejection at school, life brightens when she meets Thuy, a Vietnamese refugee her age. As the two bond and become inseparable, they eventually hurt each other, and Ellie must find a way to restore their trust. Based on director Ela Thier's personal immigration experience, Foreign Letters is a film about poverty, prejudice, shame, and the healing power of friendship.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vW7g0qvVaD5lJTDgiS2kUDmcbYi.jpg", "actors": ["Laura Camien (Mrs. Carol)", "Virginia Hastings (Ms. Para)", "Dalena Le (Thuy)", "Udi Razzin (Ellie's father)", "Noa Rotstein (Ellie)", "Daphna Thier (Dalia)", "Ela Thier (Ellie's mother)", "Ela Thier (Grandfather)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "m2H0cgrpyrU"}
