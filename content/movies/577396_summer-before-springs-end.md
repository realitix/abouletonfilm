In Miami-Dade County, an average of 30 children and teenagers are killed by gun violence annually. So far in 2016, 13 have fallen victim.  The film brings awareness to the dark and light of Overtown. The light and happy feeling of Spring\u2019s transition to Summer, juxtaposes the pain caused by gun violence. Price and O\u2019Neal both direct and edit while O\u2019Neal lends his art, poetry, and activities to showcase a tender view of his home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ihtCYKBE3L6Gzk1IWrU5sRJhER0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
