It is a very annoying film and a disgrace to include this film to cannes, which i read about it.\r\nTo top of it all, this is a comedy film without remorse recommended, with a lot of cursing \"Why the FUCK did I even bother to see this film!!!\""}], "recommandations_id": [479093, 531398, 540970, 533938], "youtube_key": "G6COwZMNIng"}
