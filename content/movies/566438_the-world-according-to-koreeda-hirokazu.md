Whatever potential there is for heightened drama \u2013 the suicide of a husband, a cult massacre, abandoned children \u2013 it is diffused by the familiar rhythms of everydayness. This attention to the everyday must be understood within the context of death, which plays a significant role in all of Koreeda\u2019s films. It is death that deepens our sense of life and makes even the most mundane moment seem profound.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ysTY96iJi9gfFhUd1qlaqfkHlfm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
