As an aspiring poet from an affluent bourgeois milieu she throws herself, full with idealism and conviction, into the labour movement. Within the various socialistic parties however, a fierce battle on direction takes place, wherein Henriette has trouble finding her place. After returning disillusioned from a trip to the Soviet Union, she does not feel at home in any leftist party. Later she will recollect on this period in her biography \"Het vuur brandde voort\" (translation: \"The fire rages on\"). The film reconstructs this period with the use of old film material combined with texts by Henriette Roland Holst herself: fragments from letters, poems, speeches and books, sparingly supplemented with personal commentary by the filmmaker.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/212w8ufuuvizpKc6ApgHRki8980.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
