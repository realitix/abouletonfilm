This was my first attempt at combining music and colors. Also, this is a story about the old florist Mikhail Mamulashvili who created wonderful compositions in his small garden.  -- Otar Iosseliani", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tMsk8ya0QwI2vdJrrkwRsZQr20E.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
