Samantha is her best friend and wears earrings in the shape of bones and leopard print leggings, like The Flinstones. There's also a pissed off pimp who never takes his sunglasses off. And a gypsy woman who smokes cigars and knows everything. And Hollywood star pictures glued to raunchy walls. And a parking lot full of whores, light bulbs and parties. And Jesuschrist. And a Hindu man passed out because of a blow job. And a lot of night exteriors, New York's, to be precise. And a pair of plastic tits that have disappeared. NIGHT FLOWERS is the punky and surreal fairytale in which all of this comes together to make sense. A short film about friendship, bravery and the ability to have dreams in other to survive. Maybe, deep down, that's what life is: a funny, tender and offbeat road trip, filled with feelings, in the search of a pair of plastic missing tits.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Kyle Ingleman (Lula)", "Doug Sharp (Samantha)", "Jon Clough (Renzo)", "Diane Sellers (Gypsy)", "Rav Val Denegro (Taxi driver)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
