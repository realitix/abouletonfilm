Appearing to simulate London\u2019s CCTV surveillance system, while replicating a video game aesthetic, Lewis\u2019 video is a slow zoom and pan of the street corner area immediately before a building. The camera\u2019s sweep captures passers-by, traffic signage, handrails and barricades, area buildings and a bit of the street. The almost featureless modernist building centrally located in the frame is set against a row of London style tudor flats.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
