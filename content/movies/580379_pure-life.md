Morning rising, television, photographic session, lunch with mother and brother, work, a visit to a porn company, meeting with a friend and work colleague, thoughts about life and love, the difficulties of opening up and surrendering in love, dinner in a friend s house at night with a full moon. His relationship with his family, his dog and the world. His lonely lifestyle. A mother he adores, an absent father, a view of the future without exaggerated ambitions and unrealistic dreams. Without lies, illusions, with respect towards the others and dignity. A pure life, like the tattoo that we see in the making on his body during the duration of the whole film.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
