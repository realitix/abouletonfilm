In the tradition of Ross McElwee, Mills created an autobiographical film in which she meditates on a universal human theme with a camera strapped to her bike. It is a contemplative response to \"An Inconvenient Truth\" and provides a unique perspective on one person's attempt to reduce her carbon footprint and overcome fear.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
