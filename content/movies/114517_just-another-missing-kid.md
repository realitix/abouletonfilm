When he went missing four days afterward in Nebraska, his family tried to persuade local and U.S. police that he wasn't simply a runaway and hadn't simply forgotten to call home. The program examines the lengths to which they had to go to find out what happened to Eric, and the byzantine nature of the legal system which seemed less interested in pursuing justice than in avoiding the expenses involved in the investigation and potential trials.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/83XgNu4zIptUhB43Hz1Qj6NENqV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
