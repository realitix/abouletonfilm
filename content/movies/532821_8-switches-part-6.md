Each new section presents a variation on the same sleek, kinetic minimalism. As each section progresses, the razor-sharp line between a host of binary oppositions\u2014black/white, figure/ground, silence/sound, here/there, on/off \u2014 dissolves through sheer velocity. The rapid-fire alternation between these binary oppositions acts like the flicker of film frames, accelerating until sound and sight are wed into a synchronous whole in which neither the visual nor the sonic takes primacy. Instead, each acts as mutually constitutive literalisation of the other.  \u2014 Joseph Clayton Mills", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iStOVZtRYRR1Bwo5oUBaRyDLTwY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
