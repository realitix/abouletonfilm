In some ways this short, thirty-six-minute film is Naruse's most moving negotiation of the militarist restrictions of the time, perhaps because it is also his most direct engagement with the culture of war. When a newsreel comes to Kameoka featuring a local man named Yoichi, it causes some excitement in the community and, of course, in Yoichi's own family. First of all his mother makes the newsreel (Nippon News, no. 14), which begins with the same marching music that opens his own film, followed by a curious baby judging context in Los Angeles featuring two hundred Japanese babies. Released in January 1941, almost a year before the pacific war begins, this \u201cfound footage\u201d is indicative of Japanese imperialist ambitions beyond Asia long before Pearl Harbor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7MgI2vQIw9Hwhm5hwFrSppBSGK8.jpg", "actors": ["Ranko Hanai (Osumi)", "Takashi Kodaka ()", "Tsuruko Mano ()", "Kinji Fujiwa ()", "Taiz\u00f4 Fukami (Schoolteacher)", "Masaru Kodaka (Shin-chan)", "Sumihiko Hara (Ken-chan)", "Makoto Matsuzaki (Masa-chan)", "Fumio Okura (Masa-chan's father)", "Soji Watari (Shige-san)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [118010], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
