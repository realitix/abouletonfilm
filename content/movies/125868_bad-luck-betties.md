Once deemed \"damaged goods\", they end up fending for themselves in the margins of society.  Now hardened, restless and with an insatiable appetite for revenge and ultra violence, they take control of \"Transaction Junction\", the main intersection used by the purveyors of vice to supply Hollywood's demand for contraband.
