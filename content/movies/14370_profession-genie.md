The newbie\u2019s roommate turns out to be the most brilliant freshman in history, who\u2019s now a senior and seemingly clouded by college-age mischief (Val Kilmer). Michelle Meyrink plays a kinetic student interested in Mitch (Jarret) while Jonathan Gries appears as a curious wraith-like individual. Robert Prescott is on hand as a brown-nosing foil.   \r\n\r\nTo give you an idea of the filmmaking style, the director also made 1983\u2019s \u201cValley Girl.\u201d \u201cReal Genius\u201d is generally on par with that more popular movie, but different due to the setting being college rather than high school, not to mention that it involves genius types. I found the witty nonchalance of Kilmer\u2019s character to be trying after a while and there\u2019s a pervading sense of un-reality about the proceedings with the peripheral characters unconvincingly over-the-top, like during the pool party or at the restaurant/bar. The ice playground at the frat house is another good example. Why sure!     \r\n\r\nStill, there\u2019s enough good here if you like 80\u2019s youth dramedies. I like the way the characters are unique rather than tried-and-true stereotypes of the genre, like jock types, hot bimbos or John Belushi\u2019s character in \u201cAnimal House\u201d (1978). \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 48 minutes and was shot in S. Cal. (Claremont, San Diego, Los Angeles and Canyon Country).
