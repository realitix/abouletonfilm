It was the senseless, brutal act of one man: Anders Breivik. WRONG TIME WRONG PLACE tells the story of 5 individuals who were present then and shows the role of coincidence in this tragedy. A sequence of small, trivial happenings marks the thin line between life and death. Two minutes earlier or later can be of decisive importance. WRONG TIME WRONG PLACE is a film about the bargain with fate. However much one tries to influence fate, in the end coincidence calls the shots.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/frgkl0yiNbvsykFGKz2GVQ5IRTX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
