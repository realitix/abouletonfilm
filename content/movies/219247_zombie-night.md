I try to never be one of those people that says \"Oh I can't believe he/she was in THAT!\" because I realize acting is still a job and helps pay the bills, but I would've been hesitant to take this job:P I was frankly surprised to see 4 pretty well-known actors in this once I started to realize how bad a script/movie it was...just DO NOT waste your time with this bc you will be very, very disappointed in the quality(and that's coming from someone who enjoys a good \"B- movie\")."}], "recommandations_id": [47436, 136476, 53502, 70574], "youtube_key": "eW-KkbO1dpo"}
