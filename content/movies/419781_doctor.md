However, that would be a far too simplistic reading of the multiple thematic elements that tie together the narrative of 'Doctor'. The idea of caste based discrimination, violence and upper-caste hypocrisy is placed alongside the notions of generational conflict in a father-son relationship and the idea of a ever-widening generation gap especially in the historical and socio-political context of the film.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Pankaj Mullick (Amar Nath)", "Ahindra Choudhury (Seeta Nath)", "Jyoti Prakash (Somnath)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
