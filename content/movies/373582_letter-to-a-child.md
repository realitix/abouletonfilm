In a series of \u201cguided monologues\u201d people \u2013 from kindergarten children to the vintage ages \u2013 are contemplating and reliving their lives. When they forget about the camera and they turn their eyes inside, the film starts. They are alone with themselves in front of us and then we are alone with ourselves, with our life, long passed, very present. Through the film the intimate diaries are silently drawing in the back a picture of human life of the last hundred years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nsnXo2wUNYybHIm0lXIyGsyBYQt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
