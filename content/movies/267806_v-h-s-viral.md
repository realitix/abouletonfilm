It does stand out in a bad way a little bit, firstly because it's a combination of fake \"found footage\" and fake \"documentary\" which... Like it's weird to have sat through all these shorts and then suddenly have a guy giving an interview to a camera crew, and secondly because I think calling it horror is a stretch. More of a... Fantasy-action-comedy with some heavy gore right at the end.\r\n\r\n**Parallel Monsters**: Has the same problems as the previous film's \"Safe Haven\" entry, but fewer pros to counterbalance it. Could probably be explored in a full length movie to better effect, but even that I'm unsure about.\r\n\r\n**Bonestorm**: The silliest and worst acted of the entire franchise, which truly is saying something. Would probably make more sense as something outside of a _V/H/_S film, say... playing silently on a loop on a TV in a skateboard shop, for instance.\r\n\r\n**Gorgeous Vortex**: The \"hidden\" _V/H/S: Viral_ entry is an odd one. The only thing it has going for it is also the dumbest thing about it. It's a 15 minute movie that is entirely aesthetic in value, the first and only entry with good video quality. But this is supposed to be a collection of crappily filmed, glitchy footage, copied over to VHS tapes - so in what universe does it make sense?\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}], "recommandations_id": [159117, 84348, 193726, 87436]}
