There we find a boy and a girl who are about to enter puberty and begin to interact with certain mythical beings, a supernatural belief very common in many Andean villages. A sinister character, pretending to be on a mission of faith, but imbued with religious dogmatism and intolerance, interrupts this peaceful scene as he casts an ominous shadow over these ancient Peruvian beliefs. Although Waldo's boss considers him inferior and distrusts his methods (a form of discrimination), the policeman continues his efforts to capture the \"Extirpator of Idolatries.\u00a8 At the same time, Waldo will resolve his own inner conflict which has troubled him all his life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Ad33Q615w7EOizH88p3v1j3TaGn.jpg", "actors": ["Oswaldo Salas (Police detective Waldo Mamani / Mythical creature)", "Magaly Solier (Mother of the boy)", "Paulina Baz\u00e1n (Village girl)", "Diego Yupanqui (Village boy)", "Augusto Casafranca (extirpator of idolatries)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "wnRRsS77qpc"}
