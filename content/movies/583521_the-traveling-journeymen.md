Alone and free, he wanders the countryside. In farms and villages both good and bad luck come his way; a farm boy, a young toff, a cute stable lad, a forward young fisherman. All cross his path. But nobody keeps him for long and he always leaves alone. Always? No, the younger son of a country doctor, fleeing from his incestuous brother, follows him on his travels. They share everything; friendship, adventures, the lessons of life - and meetings with other boys.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c2MesBhiqIXKXVfoYbit1URHhJt.jpg", "actors": ["Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Chambon (Edouard Pelletier)", "Gilles Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my (The Vagabond)", "Elyes Ardini (Armand Pelletier)", "Assan Ariana (S\u00e9bastien)", "Marco Tazzio (Victor)", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Beaufort (Ga\u00ebtan)", "Bruno de Walberg (Jean)", "Claude Busoli (Martial)", "Jean-Jacques Elineau (Charles)", "Angelo Despaz (Denis)", "G\u00e9rard Nemour (Dr. Edouard Pelletier)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
