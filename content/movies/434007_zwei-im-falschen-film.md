They're a typical couple who're stuck in a rut after eight years. Hans works at a copy shop and Heinz is an actress relegated to voicing a cartoon stoplight. On their anniversary, they go to the movies. It's a romance. But the spark on screen just doesn't strike them. When Hans gives Heinz's ex her phone number instead of putting up a fight over her, Heinz' alarm bells go off: How can this be love? They decided to make a list of everything than makes up a real love: Romance, desire, passion, jealousy, drama \u2013 deep feelings, in other words. Hans and Heinz methodically start checking off their list and realize: Real life is nothing like the movies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iOQcdXym2rbPoEEtTYjTtDrvufd.jpg", "actors": ["Marc Hosemann (Hans)", "Arnd Klawitter (Martin)", "Laura Tonke (Laura)", "Rolf Becker ()", "Marie Meinzenbach (Anna)", "Sebastian Schwarz (Basti)", "Ronny Miersch (Young Arzt)", "Katrin Wichmann (Sarah)", "Julia Schmitt (Braut)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [534011, 379280, 543720, 505204], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
