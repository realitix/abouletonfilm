From the moment in each episode when the phone rings and the Wonder Pets dramatically burst into their operetta-like singing--\"The phone! The phone is ringing!\"--young viewers are hooked. These creative stories bring together preschoolers' favorite characters--the Wonder Pets and beloved nursery rhyme and fairy tale icons--with humor, an irreverent attitude, and empowering problem-solving skills. All of which are bound to lead to happily ever after.  Two additional episodes in which the Wonder Pets save the griffin, rooster, panda, and mouse, plus a music video.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hxbaEoiCgwDmKCAfQ0qpojiDnSj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
