It looks like there's something here for everyone...But Pete has a problem: He wants to get a present for his Aunt Mabel, and he's never shopped for ladies' bows before. He'll need a lot of help from Minnie, Toodles and YOU to find the perfect gift. Then, join your Clubhouse pals for a daytime sleepover, a picnic in Mickey Park and more exciting adventures.
