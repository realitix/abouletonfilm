In 1994 Dominique Aury, a mild-mannered, dowdy editor for France\u2019s prestigious Gallimard press, revealed her authorship. Pola Rapaport explores Aury's inspiration, recreating the world of '50s literary Paris and setting it against dramatic sequences that bring the infamous book to life. The author as well as various French intellectuals expound on the thorny relationship between sexuality and power, submission and freedom, liberation and non-being.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t6aY4R6CRQkkDAOx9btlfjVMNUk.jpg", "actors": ["Catherine Mouchet (Young Dominique Aury)", "P\u00e9n\u00e9lope Puymirat (O)", "Cyril Corral (Ren\u00e9)", "Alain Rimoux (Jean Paulhan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
