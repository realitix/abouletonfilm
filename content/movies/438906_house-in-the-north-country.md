For one, it is unclear where the rehearsal ends and the performance begins. Everson's close-ups offer a distinctly cinematic rendering of theatrical blocking, with the actors' repeated movements (a soldier\u2019s salute, a woman's carrying a lit torch) taking on heightened significance. The plot remains obscure but Everson conjures a psychological intensity comparable to Maya Deren's studies for camera. - Max Goldberg", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7SjN1NkOeskfEBNcG5OKYAthY3c.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
