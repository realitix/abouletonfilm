The story in the film is happening from the morning, where/when the film starts until the night of the previous day, where/when the film ends. Everything that happens in the film is about what happened before that, before the beginning (end) of the film, when we, the spectators, entered the story, just like we were a substitution for the Fourth after his disappearance. The film is a story about remembering, three views in the same night that are trying to review its variety. The film turns the memories into dreams and reflects the surrealism of our own memories and realities.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Naida Ragimova (Lana)", "Christina Luoma (Mia)", "Henrik Walgeborg (Emil)", "Klemen Stare (\u010cetrti)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
