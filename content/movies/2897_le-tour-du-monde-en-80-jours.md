Fogg and his trusty servant Passepartout, set off on a journey that brings many adventures, and many humorous scrapes. They meet a wonderful array of characters and travel on many forms of transport, it is in short a magical journey.\r\n\r\nThe production here from Mike Todd is gargantuan, the sets are incredible, the multiple locations befit the multi cast of actors that grace the film (have fun playing spot the star in this one). The costumes and the score are spot on, while Lionel Lindon's cinematography rightly won the gold award because it's lush and cloaks the delightful story with a number of treats for the eyes. David Niven is perfect as Fogg, whilst Cantinflas as Passepartout is perfect foil for Fogg's staid stiff upper lippery.\r\n\r\nYet in spite of it's obvious beauty the film is a touch overlong, some scenes are padded far too much when surely a shorter take would have made its mark equally enough? I was surprised by the ending being so short and sweet, yes, sure it's fitting, but after sitting through just under 3 hours of film you are not being unreasonable to expect a grand fanfare type of ending. Still, it doesn't take away from this being a good cinematic achievement. As to if it stands up to repeat viewing? I'll have to see on that one... 7.5/10"}], "recommandations_id": [27191, 12311, 27367, 33667]}
