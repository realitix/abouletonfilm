Even otherwise, she nurses and harbors several two- and four-legged friends in her apartment - just as one would expect from a veterinarian's widow. Her nephew Heinz, on the other hand, is kind of beaten. Not as for the love of animals, that would fit badly to a nascent vet, but for a small animal practice, as the blessed uncle operated, he seems to have no ambitions. A future as a \"Bazillenscheuche\" in the cowshed would like to spare him again Aunt Alma. And she takes her appropriate action.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3LJMVWb6IFvO8dRZ7cFW2R2J2Q7.jpg", "actors": ["Agnes Kraus (Alma Krause)", "Fred Mahr (Dr. Otto Kr\u00f6pelin)", "Wolfgang Penz (Heinz Rascher)", "Marta Raslov\u00e1 (Jana Nowak)", "Fred Delmare (Krischan Hahnemann)", "Lubom\u00edr Kostelka (Pavel Nowak)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
