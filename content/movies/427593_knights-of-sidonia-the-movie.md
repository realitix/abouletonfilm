The solar system has been long destroyed by a strange alien race called Gauna.

After several years of drifting though space, Sidonia, a seed ship with a population of over 500,000 people, is once again threatened by Gauna. Follow Tanikaze Nagate, a mysterious young man from the deep corners of the ship, and his friends as they try to strike back against these gigantic creatures and at the same time learn what they really are for the sake of humanity's survival. -MAL", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sUJ9oZrMt22kMkKoLC3v7sYdTbx.jpg", "actors": ["Ryota Ohsaka (Tanikaze Nagate (voice))", "Satomi Arai (Hiyama Lalah (voice))", "Eri Kitamura (Honoka En (voice))", "Eri Kitamura (Honoka Hou (voice))", "Eri Kitamura (Honoka Ren (voice))", "Aya Suzaki (Hoshijiro Shizuka (voice))", "Sayaka Ohara (Kobayashi Kanchou (voice))", "Ayane Sakura (Kunato Mozuku (voice))", "Takahiro Sakurai (Kunato Norio (voice))", "Hisako Kanemoto (Midorikawa Yuhata (voice))", "Takehito Koyasu (Ochiai (voice))", "Atsuko Tanaka (Samari Ittan (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
