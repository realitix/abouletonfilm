When they decide to stick their necks out and create the first LGBTQ+ law firm in Japan, they are drawn into the lives of people searching for protection and support. Despite their own relationship having no legal status, they work pro-bono for long hours, all the while foster-parenting a teenager. We meet with a colourful cast of misfits, dissidents and artists \u2013 from a delightful eccentric being prosecuted for her kitschy vagina sculptures, to a troubled outsider who, as the child of an \u2018immoral woman\u2019, has no legal identity. A saying is repeated throughout the film, that one must \u2018read the air\u2019 \u2013 conform to the tacit conservatism that forbids sexual diversity. With love, humour and serious legal chops, Fumi and Kazu do exactly the opposite.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9iwzEgFFnMOWlJ3Y3HPuBKUkoSq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
