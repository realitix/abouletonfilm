It is a place that seems to have no purpose and which leads to nowhere. A presence is felt, but never seen. The house itself is alive; the walls are vibrating, the windows reflect abstract landscapes, the textures are constantly shifting. Created by mixing video synthesizers and 3D animation, this piece is a collage of different rooms slowly scrolling from right to left. The seamless juxtaposition of these interiors generates the illusion of a cohesive space while creating impossible perspectives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/apBKuHhZfLeF1liFVSiADeU5xst.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
