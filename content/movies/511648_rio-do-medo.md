Without denying the police\u2019s importance, but aware of the difference between restraint and police brutality, the movie will  relive the biggest events from the last decades in which those who tried to bring the military police closer to the law collided with those who transformed  it into a feared symbol of urban violence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1s6mMtjRITV1rcYaTSAEB5cJyMO.jpg", "actors": ["Vinicius Cavaliere ()", "Andr\u00e9 Yatsuda ()", "Ibis Pereira ()", "Ubiratan \u00c2ngelo ()", "Paulo Storani ()", "Ana Fucs ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
