Ralph is surprised to discover that his father is now a woman, but thinks having a transgender dad is pretty cool. But Ralph hasn't told his mother and step dad that he\u2019s tracked down his biological father. And then there is Sid\u2019s boyfriend DANIEL, who has yet to tell his family of his relationship with Sid. Daniel is nowhere near ready to accept Ralph as a step son and complicate his life further.
