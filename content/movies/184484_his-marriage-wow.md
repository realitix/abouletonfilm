Mishaps almost keep them from getting hitched: he goes to the wrong church, then, one of the guests, Professor McGlumm, convinces him that the bride only wants him to collect his life insurance. Finally they marry and her family moves in with them. Harold is now convinced that he'll be poisoned at dinner. When further mishaps give him stomach problems, McGlumm rushes him toward the hospital. On the trip, all is revealed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j2H0uMq3f0K6n61DeFJecXVPjy1.jpg", "actors": ["Harry Langdon (The Groom - Harold Hope)", "Vernon Dent (A Pessimist  - Professor McGlumm)", "Natalie Kingston (The Bride - Agnes Fisher)", "William McCall (Mr. Fisher - the Bride's Father)", "Thelma Hill (The Maid)", "Jack Murphy (Wedding Guest)", "Thelma Parr (Wedding Guest)", "Art Rowlands (The Traffic Cop)", "Ronald Tilley (The Minister)", "S.D.
