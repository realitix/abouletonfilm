Whereas \"Reitermania Over Wacken\" represents the newer side of the band and a \"regular\" (in fact, there is no regular Reiter-Show as every show is unique) show, \"Reitermania Over Party.San\" is a special old school gig with some almost forgotten gems from the first three albums! Both shows are legendary and really worth to be documented on this DVD \u2013 for every fan who missed these specials shows. \"Tobsucht \u2013 Reitermania over Wacken &amp; Party.San\" is an impressive statement of a band that continually evovled and grew over the years, but always remember: The best is yet to come!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/798AL4Bu6eI9vcoUefp00O3scrw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
