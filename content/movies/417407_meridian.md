Lightning appearing out of nowhere. A mysterious lady all dressed in white. Netflix\u2019s latest original program, \u201cMeridian,\u201d is spooky, confusing, and only 12 minutes long. That\u2019s because although \u201cMeridian\u201d is available on the streaming service worldwide, it was made not for Netflix\u2019s 83 million subscribers, but for algorithms and their programmers. Director Curtis Clark likely had artistic reasons for adding the film\u2019s strange effects. But those elements are primarily there because they tend to trip up video codecs, or software that compresses and decompresses digital video, and other elements of the streaming pipeline.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/CmUB10in1vDGpPEFQrIPwrJ6vg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
