Throughout history wizards, sorcerers and magicians have practiced in secrecy, keeping their powers hidden, guided by the Wizard's Code. But there are some who desire mastery over others and attain the highest level of magic to gain it. Even just one Wizard, obsessed with his own power, can threaten their secret world.
