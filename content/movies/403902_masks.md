He is unique and versatile. He wanders with joy throughout the artistic landscape, drawing it with his words since the early sixties. He started as a poet, he was a conceptualist, an \"invisible artist\" and a rock musician (\"Luna\"/\"La Strada\"- former Yugoslav New Wave bands). Currently, he is a prose writer, and sometimes he engages in minimalistic performances. Wearing different masks he moved from one artistic space to another breaking the stereotypes and creating an aesthetic phenomenon out of his own existence. His mainstay is margin. Through trees and ocean he communicates with the universe. He loves the game of seeking, and hiding again. He is a persistent walker. With his silent steps he pops up daily in the corners of Novi Sad, searching for his own pleasure. Similar to his writings, this film has no formal completeness and comprehensiveness. It wonders who Slobodan Ti\u0161ma is.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zPq3BK2ZIpIBSgZLWsgHuHlrFkQ.jpg", "actors": ["Slobodan Ti\u0161ma (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
