They had promised each other that they would build a retreat in Shiguretei, but Ushio was hospitalized after a stroke a few days later, and when his wife, Takako, rushed to the hospital, she discovered their love affair, which in reality had not gone beyond kissing. Now, 20 years later, against the advice of her ikebana mentor, Tae rushes to meet Ushio at Shiguretei, only to see him clutching his chest in pain. Eventually, the design and plans for the dream retreat are seen by Tae, but she has to visit Kyoto alone... or maybe she's heading for somewhere else.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lWiJXYUs0Wq8Yp11M7kpevbcftw.jpg", "actors": ["Sayuri Yoshinaga (Tae Horikawa)", "Tetsuya Watari (Konosuke Mibu)", "Ry\u00fbz\u00f4 Hayashi (Shoda)", "Tomomi Sat\u014d (Keiko Mibu)", "Ry\u00fbji Harada (Koji Mibu)", "Ryo Amamiya (Tamura)", "Kaneko Iwasaki (Natsu Kobayakawa)", "Naomi Hosokawa (Yuko Furuya)", "Nae Yuuki (Tomoko Ikawa)", "Yuki Yamabe (Masayo)", "Tetsuo Kurata (Toshiyuki Mibu)", "Yuka Shiratori (Harumi Mibu)", "Makoto Sat\u014d (Numata)", "Gin Maeda (Sofue)", "Yu Tokui (Fish dealer)", "Shigeru K\u00f4yama (Nomura)", "Takashi Tsumura (Mita)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
