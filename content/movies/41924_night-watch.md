Victor's odyssey takes him from clients to friends to a gay gym then a hotel room and an all-night caf\u00e9. He plays pick-up soccer with kids whose parents are going through trash or waiting in parks. A vendor gives him a chrysanthemum. It seems he's being followed, and on the night streets, death is close at hand. Can Victor survive until dawn?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fZwfN8ZtR31qWbj91Ii9uFCLLyX.jpg", "actors": ["Gonzalo Heredia (Victor)", "Mariana Anghileri (Cecilia)", "Rafael Ferro (Mario)", "Dar\u00edo Tripicchio (Carlitos)", "Gregory Dayton (El comisario)", "Susana Varela (Florista)", "Jana Bokova (Lady Cocaina)", "Diego Cunill (Muchacho impertinente)", "Diego Trerotola (Primer cliente de droga)", "David Solana (Segundo cliente)", "Marcelo Iglesias (La Thatcher)", "Milita Brandon (Se\u00f1ora con flores 1)", "Maria Bulacio (Se\u00f1ora con flores 2)", "Mart\u00edn C\u00e9spedes (Joven lector en el Bar)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [511186, 301346], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
