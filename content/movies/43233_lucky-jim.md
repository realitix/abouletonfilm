At the university he has to do the bidding of absent-minded and boring Professor Welch to have any hope of keeping his job. Worse, he has managed to get entangled with unexciting but neurotic Margaret Peel, a friend of the Professor's. All-in-all, the pub is the only friendly place to be. His misery is completed at a dreadful weekend gathering of the Welch clan by the arrival of son Bertrand. Not so much that Betrand is loud-mouthed and boorish - which he is - but that he has as companion Christine Callaghan, the sort of marvellous and unattainable woman Jim can only dream about.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qxL7xtv8vOxgpAisDqCS7RSMLST.jpg", "actors": ["Ian Carmichael (Jim Dixon)", "Terry-Thomas (Bertrand Welch)", "Hugh Griffith (Professor Welch)", "Sharon Acker (Christine Callaghan)", "Jean Anderson (Mrs. Welch)", "Maureen Connell (Margaret Peel)", "Clive Morton (Sir Hector Gore-Urquhart)", "John Welsh (The Principal (as John Welch))", "Reginald Beckwith (University Porter)", "Kenneth Griffith (Cyril Johns)", "Jeremy Hawk (Bill Atkinson)", "Ronald Cardew (Registrar)", "Penny Morrell (Miss Wilson)", "John Cairney (Roberts)", "Ian Wilson (Glee Singer)", "Charles Lamb (Contractor)", "Henry B.
