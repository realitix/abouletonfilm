In 1944, the camp commander commissioned a film, shot by a photographer, Rudolph Breslauer. \u201cBy exhuming the scattered fragments and traces of the phantom film (intertitle cards, ideas for the scenario, graphic elements), Harun Farocki inscribes the Dutch footage within the genre of the corporate film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nHImkkyGhdQi9sut7vZQNokhemd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [243764], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
