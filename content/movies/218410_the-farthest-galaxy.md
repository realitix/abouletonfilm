The body was never identified so the case was never solved. Three years after his retirement, Watari unexpectedly discovers a clue that may finally solve the case. However, at the same time, he learns he does not have long to live. Although he is no longer on the police force, he puts all his energy into reinvestigating the case, in a race to solve the mystery before he dies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/VJbVqsPH1tK6GmNUC2C4UKTvsp.jpg", "actors": ["Tomokazu Miura (Seiichiro Watari)", "Hideaki Ito (Haruyuki Kiryu)", "Y\u016b Aoi (Misato Ebata / Akane Seike)", "Manami Konishi (Kaoru Saotome)", "Yuta Hiraoka (Ryoichi)", "Hiroyuki Ikeuchi ()", "Masaru Nagai ()", "Jun Fubuki ()", "Masahiko Tsugawa ()", "Shir\u00f4 Sano ()", "Koichi Iwaki ()", "Masanori ishii ()", "Takehiro Hira ()", "Yuri Nakamura ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
