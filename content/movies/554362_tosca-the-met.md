Luciano Pavarotti is Cavaradossi, the painter and political revolutionary in love with the beautiful and famous singer Tosca (the riveting Shirley Verrett). Rome\u2019s diabolical chief of police, Baron Scarpia (Cornell MacNeil), wants Tosca for himself\u2014but he underestimates the fury of a woman in love. With torture, murder, and a suicide in its final moments, Tosca packs more dramatic punches than most other operas\u2014and this classic telecast captures them all. James Conlon conducts in a production by the incomparable Tito Gobbi, one of the great Scarpias of the 20th century.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nqckRYRaQlbBMpaoHOkBA86TMQa.jpg", "actors": ["Shirley Verrett ()", "Luciano Pavarotti ()", "Cornell MacNeil ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
