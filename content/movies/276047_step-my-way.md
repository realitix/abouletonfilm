Beginning with basic movements, Goudeau slowly adds embellishments (including twists, turns, hops and repeaters) and leaves it up to you to decide the final outcome. The result is a custom-built cardio experience that can be different every time.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
