He destroys Woody's bed with a drill and Woody plans to get even. First, he sticks a pan over said drill, then sticks his foot in the tree's branch and kicks the doctor in the face with it. He also inflates the doctor's stethoscope with a bellows until it explodes and holds up a sexy pin-up when the doctor x-rays the tree. Finally, Doc discovers Woody and gives chase but Woody inevitably outsmarts him knocking the doc unconscious. The pest gone, Woody can now continue his rest.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sbDVCHZMJqTiXlqCEwwgYR1bxwm.jpg", "actors": ["Daws Butler (Tree Surgeon (voice) (uncredited))", "Grace Stafford (Woody Woodpecker (voice) (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
