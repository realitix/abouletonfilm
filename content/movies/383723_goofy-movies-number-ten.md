Next, the \"Wotaphony Newsreel\" shows clips of early experimental aircraft failing to fly. The \"Added Attraction\" is a clip of a bear jumping into a large fish tank and trying to catch the fish. Finally, the \"Super Stupid Pictures\" feature is a narrated silent film telling the life story of an ill-fated woman who was left on a doorstep as an infant, was taken advantage of by men for most of her life, and then came to a sad end after she had turned the tables on them. - Written by TimeNTide on IMDB", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Pete Smith (Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
