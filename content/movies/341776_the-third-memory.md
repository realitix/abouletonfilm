Working in an array of cultural formats\u2014from billboards and television broadcasts to community celebrations and museum exhibitions\u2014he reformulates their codes and deploys them as catalysts for creating new experiential possibilities. A mode of perception that lies in the interstices between reality and its representation is the subject of his two-channel video, The Third Memory (2000), which reenacts the 1972 hold-up of a Brooklyn bank immortalized in Sidney Lumet's acclaimed film Dog Day Afternoon (1975). Almost 30 years later, Huyghe provides a platform for the heist's charismatic mastermind, John Wojtowicz, to relate his version of that infamous day in a reconstructed set of the bank.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xeny2seliiUvZhLZmFl10mnWQvy.jpg", "actors": ["John Wojtowicz (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
