Though riddled with familiar motifs (nods to Bernard Herrmann\u2019s scores, Stanley Kubrick's unnerving spaces, the mesmerizing portraits of women in VERTIGO and LAURA), the second film in Jamie Travis\u2019 PATTERNS trilogy achieves a singular blend of horror, melodrama and musical. This installment centers on Michael, a nervous guy puzzling over an unexpected Chinese takeout order. Even as some of the mysteries from the first PATTERNS are revealed, the trilogy plunges deeper into a quicksand of shared dreams, hidden anxieties and romantic yearning.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vVXitJ3Ecn48WevgB091opE6VNq.jpg", "actors": ["Christopher Redman (Michael)", "Courtenay Webber (Pauline)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
