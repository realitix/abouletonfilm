Newley stars as Littlechap, whose allegorical rise to success is countered by the instability of his private life. Like the play, the film is staged impressionistically, with Newley decked out in mime makeup and periodically stopping the action to address the audience, and with all the women in his life -- German, American and \"Typically English\" -- played by a single actress (Millicent Martin, taking over from the stage version's Anna Quayle). In Wizard of Oz fashion, the play itself is lensed in color, while the brief prologue, showing the actors preparing for their performance, is in black-and-white. The production includes such standards (and perennial audition pieces) as What Kind of Fool Am I? and Gonna Build a Mountain.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5JqMX9OKzM5fIHvJlp5NqQgnNJV.jpg", "actors": ["Tony Tanner (Little Chap)", "Millicent Martin (Evie / Anya / Ara / Ginnie)", "Leila Croft (Susan)", "Valerie Croft (Jane)", "Neil Hawley (Little Little Chap)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ulaQMN4xgGw"}
