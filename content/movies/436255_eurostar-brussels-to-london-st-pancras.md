Riding with the driver at speeds of up to 300 kilometres an hour, or 186 miles an hour, is an exhilarating experience. Just click on the preview to see what we mean.  The entire route is shown in virtual real time.*  As well as calling at Lille Europe and Ebbsfleet International, we follow our class 373's progress from the five control centres which are responsible for our train as it passes through Belgium, France, the Channel Tunnel and England.  There are two bonus features:  Temple Mills Depot, opened in time for the start of services into St Pancras.  Comings and goings at Brussels Midi. While our cameras were set up on the platform we filmed a dozen or more trains to show the diversity of traction and rolling stock.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ApUFvCcJ33MAZrdbGXNmhtlvIOu.jpg", "actors": ["Jonathan Kydd (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "8jTYZNME-3I"}
