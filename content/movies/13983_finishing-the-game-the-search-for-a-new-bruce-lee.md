With the public hungry for more Lee, movie execs decide to find a replacement. This outrageous satire looks at the entire process, from the oddball candidates to the greed and racial motivations that drive the final decision. There's big business in the movies, and Finishing the Game skewers it with an eye for '70s detail.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lut6bXLpGomB0MFWIac6zueon8l.jpg", "actors": ["Roger Fan (Breeze Loo)", "Sung Kang (Cole Kim)", "Monique Gabriela Curnen (Saraghina Rivas)", "Meredith Scott Lynn (Eloise Gazdag)", "Sam Bottoms (Martey Kurtainbaum)", "Jake Sandvig (Ronney Kurtainbaum)", "Ron Jeremy (Peter Dowd)", "Mousa Kraish (Raja)", "McCaleb Burnett (Tarrick Tyler)", "Dustin Nguyen (Troy Poon)", "James Franco (Dean Silo)", "Bella Thorne (Additional Extra)", "Davis Choh (Man #4)", "Remy Thorne (Additional Extra)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [39497, 21119, 20750, 229050], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
