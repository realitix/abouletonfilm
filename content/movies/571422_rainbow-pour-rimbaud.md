In this film, Robert is an eccentric, oversized young man who puzzles and infuriates his parents by locking himself into a closet for long periods of time; at the same time, he loudly recites poetry by Arthur Rimbaud. Kicked out of the house by his exasperated parents, he decides to make a pilgrimage of the exotic African sites Rimbaud haunted in his final years. He meets and then travels with Isabelle, who is attempting to escape from a rejected suitor's unwanted attentions. In addition to that problem, she has another, more curious problem. It seems she is turning into a hawthorn bush.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xzeoB1bPnMytEXZ9aTiW2ZVu3Ma.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
