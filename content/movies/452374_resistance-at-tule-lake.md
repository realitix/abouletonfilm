Branded as 'disloyals' and re-imprisoned at Tule Lake Segregation Center, they continued to protest in the face of militarized violence, and thousands renounced their U.S. citizenship. Giving voice to experiences that have been marginalized for over 70 years, this documentary challenges the nationalist, one-sided ideal of wartime 'loyalty.'", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fIaf5wmnxos4mQfFslih3k4bHol.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "QSuf8N5we5U"}
