He meets various Shetland people in unrehearsed situations. Many assume him to be a real person and not a comic creation, though some scenes are acted, particularly parts with famous local tour guide Elma Johnson.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nokfYwVhSSQ3PdaZBkHJ2qJsXbM.jpg", "actors": ["Graham Fellows (John Shuttleworth/Ken Worthington (voice))", "Elma Johnson (Herself)", "Martin Parr (Himself)", "Stuart Thom (Himself)", "Tim Humphries (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
