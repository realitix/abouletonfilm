As a thief breaks into a middle class apartment of a young couple at one end of the city, a Himalaya returned Guru settles for a religious discourse at a business magnets bungalow the same night. As Pada , the thief faces a stiff situation, Swad Gajananda Swami by the virtue of his magical powers mesmerizes his disciples and enjoys the best of food, hospitality &amp; other generous attention. The two incidents are too far fetched to have any connecting possibilities. But fate has other things in store. It's a question of putting up an act and sticking by it!!!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AusFsvtIvUKgYBTIgP6Cq1KiymE.jpg", "actors": ["Bratya Basu (Sad Gajananda / Thief)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Hzszoqla_uc"}
