Fretting over his wife's ticking clock, Dave happens upon Ruby, a tempestuous beauty on the run with a mean-looking baby on her arm while toting a gun. Thus begins a series of capers that revolve around the helpless, yet, testy baby, a strapping town sheriff, a gun-loving bounty hunter and a snitching clown. All are involved in an ever-twisting plot in a quest for ownership of the baby Lloyd. The all night journey ultimately provides all characters their unsought solutions towards the lives they've been wanting.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5tFvD5wWNILwplrcS2jdLaDbooV.jpg", "actors": ["Marisa Coughlan (Ruby)", "Samuel Ball (Dave)", "Ione Skye (Jolynn)", "Rex Linn (Jeddidah)", "Christopher Wiehl (Roy)", "Peter Dobson (Maddox)", "Patricia Belcher (Abagail)", "Arden Myrin (Sarah)", "Hansford Rowe (Ed)", "Holgie Forrester (Opal)", "Bruno Alexander (Burly Man)", "Jackie O'Brien (Motel clerk)", "Shadi Dwait (Gun runner)", "Gabriel Jarret (The clown)", "Andy Berman (Bo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
