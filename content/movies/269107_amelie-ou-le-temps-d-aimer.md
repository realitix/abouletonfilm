Directed by Michel Drach in his second try at a feature-length film, the well-wrought romance revolves around the love that develops between Amelie (Marie-Jose Nat) and her cousin Alain (Jean Sorel). Amelie is an orphan who lives with Alain and his family on an island off the coast of France. Alain has dreams of working as a seaman, while Amelie works for Alain's father. The budding romance between the two takes a nose-dive when Alain falls for a glamorous actress who shows up on the island one day. Not mature enough yet to make a wise choice, Alain's betrayal of Amelie turns out to be a grievous mistake.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xRNC8VLDEWSjsZZ3KN5AXt8uy1e.jpg", "actors": ["Marie-Jos\u00e9 Nat (Am\u00e9lie)", "Jean Sorel (Alain)", "Clotilde Joano (Fanny)", "Roger Van Mullem (Monsieur Boule)", "Pascale de Boysson (La servante des Boule)", "Sophie Daumier (Emmannuelle)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
