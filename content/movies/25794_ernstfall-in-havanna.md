While accompanying an US senator on his mission in Cuba, he makes a botch of so many things, that a minor blunder by the Senator turns into a serious incident, which intensifies into a second Cuban crisis - thanks to further entanglements by the media, police, and diplomats who represent the arch-enemies USA and Cuba. Only one person can eventually solve the crisis: Stefan Balsiger himself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jEgGb1RSaLV4IpMR3bpVcLjeZpw.jpg", "actors": ["Viktor Giacobbo (Stefan Balsiger)", "Mike M\u00fcller (Bruno R\u00fcegg)", "J\u00fcrg L\u00f6w (Ernst O.
