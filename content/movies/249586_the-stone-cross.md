The film captured moments shortly before the farmer set off for his voyage and had to say \u201cgood-bye\u201d to his native village, friends and relatives. The internal conflict of the farmer in doubt about his decision became the central focus of the film. Like Vasyl Stefanyk\u2019s novella that inspired it, the film is a meditation on the sense of one\u2019s belonging, the sense of one\u2019s own culture and what it means to abandon it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b0ZOrYCEs2IjjdIVErgFAs51mIQ.jpg", "actors": ["Daniil Ilchenko (Ivan)", "Yakaterina Mateyk (Ivanikha)", "Borislav Brondukov ()", "Ivan Mykolaichuk (Mykola)", "Konstantin Stepankov (Mykhailo)", "Vasyl Simchich (Georgi)", "Antonina Leftii (Antonina)", "Boris Savchenko (Dmytro)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
