A journey through the ancient Southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu featuring Hindu trance ceremonies, street music, festivals, nagaswaram improvisations, impossibly loud cities, ancient temples, processions, devotions, decay, fireworks, abstractions and more. India is impossible to know: it is impossibly old and impossibly new, impossibly rich and impossibly poor, quiet and chaotic. Offered here is one perspective, raw, captured live and in the moment, with an emphasis on India's complex and mesmerizing sounds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sKKDx65krmMVIvKlJllUBSiw0Ut.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "1iIpPPccNVc"}
