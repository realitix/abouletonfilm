He weds Elisa Cegani, a servant girl, who turns out to be a more appealing wife than any of the others could have been. Assis Noris decorates the screen well as one of the chasers and pursuers. In 1937, De Sica and Noris made a film, \"II Signor Max,\" which, other than the setting and character role names, basically has the same plot as this film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9BUohl7NXid2SqyS0PLFYgaD8Ti.jpg", "actors": ["Vittorio De Sica (Memmo Speranza)", "Elisa Cegani (Gasperina)", "Umberto Melnati (Vico Lamanna)", "Assia Noris (Loletta Festa)", "Elsa De Giorgi (Elsa)", "Ugo Ceseri (Barranco)", "Vivi Gioi (Matilde)", "Giuseppe Pierozzi (Un pensionnaire)", "Maria Arcione ()", "Celeste Calza ()", "Jole Capodaglio ()", "Antonio Centa ()", "Mario Ferrari ()", "Giuliana Gianni ()", "Zoe Incrocci ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
