In physical terms, a transfiguration is a change in form, a remodeling of appearance. The word derives from the ancient Greek \u2018metemorphothe\u2019 or 'metamorphosis,\u2019 suggesting a complete reformation. However, the word takes on its fullest meaning in the spiritual context when it refers to the moment when a person or an object is transformed not by external means but from within. The resulting change is absolute and thorough, affecting the heart and soul of the subject. Although the outward appearance can sometimes be altered in this process as well, it is not necessary. A deeper, more profound, complete transformation occurs inside, out of sight and, for a person it reformulates the very fiber of their being, finally radiating outward to affect everything around it.\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dfe02f4Nw6cDfXWI6ldeh29xkWt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
