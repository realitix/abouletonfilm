Various camera tricks are  used to dramatize the action, notably stop-motion, that freezes the  ballet-like leaps and postures of the players. The film has jazz  background music. -NFB", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
