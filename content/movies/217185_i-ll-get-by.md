William Lundigan and Dennis Day play William Spencer and Freddie Lee respectively, successful song publishers who make hits out of such numbers as \"I Got a Gal in Kalamazoo\", \"Deep in the Heart of Texas\", \"You Make Me Feel So Young\", \"There Will Never Be Another You\", and other favorites (the rights to all of these songs were conveniently held by 20th Century-Fox). The partnership has some hard times, especially during the feud between ASCAP and the radio networks, when only public-domain songs like \"I Dream of Jeannie\" were permitted to be broadcast.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dnesSaDJ86OLIBjDC81xWiy9W4s.jpg", "actors": ["June Haver (Liza Martin)", "William Lundigan (William Spencer)", "Gloria DeHaven (Terry Martin)", "Dennis Day (Freddy Lee)", "Harry James (Harry James)", "Thelma Ritter (Miss Murphy)", "Steve Allen (Peter Pepper)", "Danny Davenport (Chester Dooley)", "Harry Antrim (Mr. Olinville)", "Bess Flowers (Lady in Audience at The Roxy)", "Jeanne Crain (Herself (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
