He is married to the much younger Mediha (Sahra \u015ea\u015f), and they live a rather conventionally dull and almost unhappy life. Yakup\u2019s enjoyment is limited to following his favourite football team, while Mediha tries to escape by watching television. The arrival of a newlywed couple will agitate their secluded routine. Riza (\u00d6ner Erkan), who works as an assistant at the farm, and his wife Nurg\u00fcl (\u0130rem Sak) are almost the opposite of them. Liberal and open-minded in every possible aspect, the new couple settles next-door and starts to influence Mediha\u2019s and Yakup\u2019s lifestyle. The traditional austerity is suddenly influenced by the new \u201cWestern\u201d trends and the claustrophobic environment will be the perfect setting for the heroes to unveil their true identities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aUJVnCZhbt1wSMa9Dy9syO874Fk.jpg", "actors": ["Onur Buldu (Yakup)", "\u0130rem Sak (Mediha)", "\u00d6ner Erkan (R\u0131za)", "Sahra \u015ea\u015f (Nurg\u00fcl)", "Er\u015fan Utku \u00d6lmez ()", "Rojhat \u00d6zsoy ()", "Myla Asya \u00c7\u0131vg\u0131n ()", "Ahmet Burak Bacinoglu ()", "Levent Aras ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
