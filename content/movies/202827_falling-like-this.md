Writer/Director Dani Minnick has crafted a compassionate examination of the ragged edge of suburban life as characterized by Boyd, a charming, vulnerable and inveterate juvenile delinquent whose love nearly derails the life of a middle-class teenage girl. The understated themes of adolescent rebellion, adult responsibility and the redemptive power of love are woven elegantly into this dream-like film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9jPLYwxOipzHTA3gRKDhbaToDQq.jpg", "actors": ["Brian Vaughan (Boyd L.
