But she doesn't remember him from their school days. As the result of a drunken-driving arrest, Kreng is reunited with Fai, who comes to bail him and his best friend (her ex-husband) out of jail. Kreng is sentenced to perform community service, and so he becomes the volunteer teacher for a group of retirees who are learning how to use the Internet. This puts Kreng and Fai in touch with the older couple - Sompit (Sunsanee Wattananukul), a widow who has fallen in love with her classmate Jamrus (Krissana Setthatumrong). The silver-haired gent is a smooth talker, but he has a problem - he's losing his memory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iQ47uSl2dQtGNi56r26rLBCEmEy.jpg", "actors": ["Arak Amornsupasiri (Keng)", "Yarinda Bunnag (Fai)", "Sunsanee Wattananukul (Ms. Sompit)", "Krissana Sreadthatamrong (Mr. Jamras)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [85294], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
