They visit the cemetery where Winnie's father is buried. Also in the cemetery are two art students, one of whom (Liz) asks if she can take a photograph of the three women. She takes it while they are not prepared, making them look ridiculous (Cora is putting her make-up on, Winnie is staring at the camera with her mouth open). Cora is angry, and Liz takes another of them properly posed. But she enters the first photograph for a competition, where it wins a prize.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5nd8NPffCbLJCjfvWJp1ifiVyhd.jpg", "actors": ["Elizabeth Spriggs (Cora)", "Constance Chapman (Ida)", "Sheila Kelley (Winnie)", "Max Hafler (First Attendant)", "Jim Broadbent (Second Attendant)", "Lesley Manville (Liz)", "Jimmy Yuill (Charles)", "Avril Elgar (Ivy)", "Peter Lorenzelli (Eric)", "Veronica Roberts (Interviewer)", "Jackie Shinn (Undertaker)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
