Being young, innocent, and naive, she is taken in by a lady who promises to help and shelter her, only to find out that the house is a \"pleasure's den\" catering to gentlemen and their needs. Na'eema finally meets Hassan, the love of her life, who promises to take her away from this sordid life and protect her. When he asks her to move in with his mother, they are both in for a big surprise. Will Na'eema finally be safe?  Starring Sabah, Shukri Sarhan, Hassan Riyad, Zuzu Nabil, and Wedad Hamdi. Script by Mohammad Mustafa Sami, Directed by Hassan El Imam.  Nice movie with manipulative people corrupting the innocent! Also has some nicely staged songs by Sabah. I didn't tag this as musical though. The songs are stage performances.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/awO6CbMJHepEfzOjNs9zVBthcl8.jpg", "actors": ["Sabah ()", "Shukri Sarhan ()", "Hassan Riyad ()", "Zuzu Nabil ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
