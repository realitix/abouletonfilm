This lavish Western film was remade in 1944 as an early Robert Mitchum B-picture, the only time Cooper and Mitchum played the same role. This movie still survives in a complete copy, but the films appearance is not the best, do probably to poor preservation, it's possible to make out scenes, but not as well as other highly restored silent films. This was a very early western role for Gary Cooper, but his fame in western would be more noticeable in talking pictures.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xIEKi1qaA1Ipfd5YtNLWJPvFsoY.jpg", "actors": ["Gary Cooper (Nevada)", "Thelma Todd (Hettie Ide)", "William Powell (Clan Dillon)", "Philip Strange (Ben Ide)", "Ernie Adams (Cash Burridge)", "Christian J.
