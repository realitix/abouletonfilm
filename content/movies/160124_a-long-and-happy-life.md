He gets on well with his farm workers who respect him and also tolerate his more or less clandestine love-affair with Anya, a secretary at the local government office. But then Sascha is suddenly faced with a dilemma: the district\u2019s self-seeking administrators, none of whom could be termed squeamish, offer him a lucrative deal for the farm. In legal terms, Sascha doesn\u2019t have much of a leg to stand on since his lease on the farm was only agreed with a handshake. The pressure mounts, and even more so when his employees convince him to stand firm. Against the backdrop of a landscape exposed to the elements, this unflinching man\u2019s destiny takes its course.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wa3YSDKqm9zfHomlsKwtAWAcrq6.jpg", "actors": ["Anna Kotova ()", "Yevgeni Syty ()", "Gleb Puskepalis ()", "Aleksandr Yatsenko ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [12681, 31227, 52322, 84442], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
