Every family, at some point, has had somebody leave their native country behind to search for a better life. How did they hold onto their identity? How did they adapt to their new life? Every family has a special story. In my case, it's my Chinese-American story. My father would always tell us his story about walking for 7 days and 6 nights, before swimming for 4 hours to Macau to escape communism in 1966. His story would fall on my deaf ears until I returned to China with him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zPpNRvilVZzVez1IhkyGMK1G8jJ.jpg", "actors": ["Yau King Eng ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
