The Battle of the Sexes was the most-watched live sporting event at that time, and pitted chauvinist against feminist, when women tennis players demanded equal pay to that of their male counterparts. Both players are performed by Mateik, whose work wages strategic operations to overthrow institutions of compulsory gender. After each game the competitors \"switch sides\". Excerpts from the sports commentators, Howard Cosell and Rosie Casals, exemplify the spirit of the match.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bdz3CUuKEo02RG1Fhv3qM7WymGu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
