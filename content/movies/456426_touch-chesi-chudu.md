The movie could be a dengerous move by the star Ravi Teja because it lacks the freshness and poor storyline. So if you are a die hard fan of Ravi Teja's Mass Masala and have watched other movies of Ravi Teja, then you might like the movie because Touch Chesi Chandu is not out of track movie, but filled with Stunts, Action, Humour and punch dialogues as usual.
