Cycles are left incomplete. Chases are never consummated; the day ends with no promise of rebirth. In this way the film touches on our oldest instincts, leaving us saddened and scared by the knowledge of a world that will never know freedom through the completion of action; safety through the sanctification of place.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8IeCUweENsnHpIKPCUOvbO3d4b4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
