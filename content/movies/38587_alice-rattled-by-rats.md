He chases one pesky rat inside the house, and shoots a hole in the floor, which he falls through, into a vat of home-brew. With the cat thus away, the rats play, at first dancing and singing, and later playing in the bathtub. The cat eventually sobers up (after he lands in a cactus), and tries to blow up the rats (and house!) with a bomb, but the rats plant the bomb on the cat, who blows up himself, Alice, and several nearby trees.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qEaaG29IWCInjk5O5eqUmlmVij9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
