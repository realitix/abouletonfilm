Benedicte is 20 years old and lives with Henri who is considerably older. She is still haunted by two former loves, Pierre, whom she still cares for, and Paul, who still cares for her. She is faced with a major decision when she finds a bag filled with a fortune of francs and a gun. Should she keep it for herself, or should she return it? This question plagues her; she gets no help from family, friends, or lovers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bzGLvyNps8FTdJlp1FtqHOTP2IU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
