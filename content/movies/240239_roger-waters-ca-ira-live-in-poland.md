A full operatic performance took place on 25 August 2006 in Poznan, Poland, and was televised live on Poland's TVP. The project involved the same number of musicians from the concert performances in addition to more than 200 dancers from the Great Theatre in Poznan. There were also period elements of stage design (such as horses, carriages and war scenes with soldiers and stunt performers) and full costumes. Over 500 artists were involved, and the production reportedly cost in excess of \u20ac2 million. Performances were held in Kiev on 16 December, and at the Poznan Opera House on 30 and 31 December 2006.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9s6OePpv1LnAO0eoLzUo8RDnQYN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
