It's a spiritual crisis for this Chinese immigrant who quotes Confucius, this Lothario and con artist who fences stolen goods. He falls for Kyoko, a seemingly shy provincial woman looking for the man who jilted her sister. As their relationship plays out, Hanawa intercuts stories of Kazuo, a hyper- kinetic artist who loves the trendy Yoko (Kazuo bores her and she pursues the indifferent Zhou), and Ali, a Pakistani Muslim who, broke and forlorn, stands outside a convenience store love-struck by a clerk because she looked into his eyes (she thought he was shop-lifting)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sY0kAH8pLROeB8iCuWdhC2PkmS8.jpg", "actors": ["Xiu Jian ()", "Mikako Takahashi ()", "Yukio Yamato ()", "Asami Kanai ()", "Ali Ahmed ()", "Kae Minami ()", "Xia Pu ()", "Jin Qiang Min ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
