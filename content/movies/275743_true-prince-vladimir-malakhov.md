The film chronicles the rituals of a dancer's daily life - the rehearsals, the fans, the backstage milieu, and the strenuous performance demands of an international star. Through it all, Malakhov remains a modern man with an old-fashioned virtue - complete dedication to his art.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
