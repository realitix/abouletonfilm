The Manslayer takes place more than a hundred years ago. The leading character Maara is a young bride who is about to start her life in her new family. The Virgin, set in the spring of 1949, tells the story of a young woman called Elina, who has been deported from Ingria into Estonia during the previous war. The Shadow moves in the present, on the border of real life and fantasy. The main character, Luna Lee, has decided to flee from home. Is there anything besides emptiness somewhere? The film is led by the singularity of the leading character - Maara, Elina and Luna Lee are all played by the same actress.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pt0PESiUzL3MGcjvsnI0IVwtbka.jpg", "actors": ["Rea Lest (Maara / Elina / Luna Lee)", "J\u00f6rgen Liik ()", "Toomas Suuman ()", "\u00dcllar Saarem\u00e4e ()", "Priit Pedajas ()", "Katariina Unt ()", "Peeter Volkonski ()", "Juhan Ulfsak ()", "Ain Lutsepp ()", "Mari Lill ()", "Helena Merzin ()", "Elle Kull (Elina)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "MenRHOShysQ"}
