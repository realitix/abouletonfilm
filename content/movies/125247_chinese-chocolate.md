They quickly learn that the paths of heart are rocky as the men in their lives reveal dark, unsettling secrets which change the lives of everyone forever. Intimately and honestly exploring for the first time the sexuality of Chinese women living in a foreign culture, this award-winning study of love and relationship makes for a unforgettable treat.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hPipKknfrusu961k1dVIEC4BYr.jpg", "actors": ["Yan Cui (Camille (as Shirley Cui))", "Diana Pang (Jesse (as Diana Peng))"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "brokiepmb", "content": "Beautifully shot and performed despite the bleak and sometimes hard to bear images and intimation. The interesting issue is that the film is focused on the sexuality of Chinese immigrants, especially women. An interesting if unsettling addition to the traditional eastern fare, this film exposes the dark underside of the Asian societal underbelly - one not often seen and consequently hard to bear. Sensual and intimate without being condescending, Chinese Chocolate handles explosive subject matter sensibly."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
