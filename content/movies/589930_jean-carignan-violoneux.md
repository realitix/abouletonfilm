In his hands reels become complex, intelligent creations, played with a virtuosity worthy of Paganni, and which continue the traditions of a genre passed on orally. A genre which has retained its popularity, and whose giants include Skinner, Coleman, Allard. Jean Carignan tackles their repertoire, as well as reaping the harvest of his exploration of Irish and Scottish musical traditions, which has made of him an internationally renowned specialist in Celtic music. This film is also a love story between an impoverished child and his violin, and provide a unique window into a remarkable era.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jean Carignan ()", "Paul Gosselin ()", "Benoit Bernier ()", "L\u00e9o Plamondon ()", "Arcade Gosselin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
