Pavle, Stojan and Dragisa, the three war friends are taking different positions within the society immediately after the war. Pavle, a former war commissar, is now a school teacher. Thanks to him, Stojan, who was a bakery assistant before the war, does the job of a district committee's secretary, while Dragisa works in the state's secret police. The reason of conflict between Pavle and Stojan in 1947 was Stojan's fianc\u00e9e Lena, who loves Pavle, marries him and gets pregnant, right when Pavle is taken to the state prison. Stojan accepts his wife and kid again, but the avalanche of political events will make all them unable to stop the inevitable catastrophe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kt0cHL3dpWNEM21s9aozfO79iNB.jpg", "actors": ["Lazar Ristovski (Pavle)", "Dragan Nikoli\u0107 (Pavlovi\u0107)", "Velimir \"Bata\" \u017divojinovi\u0107 (Vuji\u0107)", "Sne\u017eana Bogdanovi\u0107 (Lena)", "\u017darko Lau\u0161evi\u0107 (Stojan)", "Du\u0161an Jaki\u0161i\u0107 (Dragi\u0161a)", "Ru\u017eica Soki\u0107 (Mileva)", "Neboj\u0161a Bako\u010devi\u0107 (Pavle Pavlovi\u0107)", "Neda Arneri\u0107 (Du\u0161anka)", "Goran Naskov (Nikola)", "Vesna Trivali\u0107 (Magda)", "Ivan Klemenc (Pop)", "Milivoje Mi\u0107a Tomi\u0107 (Radoje)", "Vladan \u017divkovi\u0107 (Udba\u0161)", "Uro\u0161 La\u0161i\u0107 (Beba Nikola)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
