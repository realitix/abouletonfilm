He persuades the young novice monk to smuggle him into Shaolin, but Ting's presence isn't welcome and he is driven out, but remains close to the temple, keeping in touch with Hsu Shi. When Ting rescues a girl from the clutches of the Flying Eagle gang, the Golden Wheel Lama and sworn enemy of Shaolin finds the perfect excuse to lead an assault on the Temple. Realizing Ting's devotion, the abbot decides to bring Ting into the Shaolin order and teach him the deadliest techniques to prepare him for the Lama's merciless fury.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wmOwYQQzIawPNX4BHFZa4m9lNNA.jpg", "actors": ["Alexander Lo Rei  (Sun Yi Ting)", "Chen Shan (Golden Wheel Lama)", "Wong Chi-Sang (Mr. Tso)", "Sun Jung-Chi (Grandmaster that eats meat)", "William Yen (Hsu Shan / Hsu Erh)", "Chang Chi-Ping (head abbot)", "Lee Wai-Wan (girl on the run)", "Lee Wai-Wan (girl on the run)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [39901], "youtube_key": "lfG_4DAm6RE"}
