Everything seems to be fine in her little world: she is hoping to start her own dance academy and has romantic plans. However, one day she finds out that something strange is happening at her parents house: an underground and latent discomfort grows week by week. Gloria, her mother, seems absent, talking about strange events far from her daily routine and experiencing memory lapses. Almost at the same time, Nacho, Marcela's father, loses his job and, with it, his self esteem. Marcela forgets about her own needs choosing instead to concentrate on her parents troubles and reestablishing family harmony.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/21LX9DRXp2XjezbqdpPXQEuZnNj.jpg", "actors": ["Natalia Esper\u00f3n ()", "Margarita Sanz ()", "Fernando Becerril ()", "Hern\u00e1n Mendoza ()", "Zaide Silvia Guti\u00e9rrez ()", "Carmen Huete ()", "Enrique Arreola ()", "Luis R\u00e1bago ()", "Jorge Galv\u00e1n ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
