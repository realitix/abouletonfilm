But when the kids get to Madison County, the author is no where to be found and the towns people act like they haven't seen him in years. They also say that the killer never existed and the murders never happened. However, when the kids start digging around to get their own answers, they find out that the stories maybe more real than the townspeople are letting on!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ekyGuo6hhsT1RhNr9zV25JRWJla.jpg", "actors": ["Colley Bailey (James)", "Matt Mercer (Will)", "Ace Marrero (Kyle)", "Joanna Motomura (Brooke)", "Natalie Scheetz (Jenna)", "Nick Principe (Damian Ewell)", "Adrienne Harrell (Erma)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "Gimly", "content": "I'm always on the lookout for the Slasher of the New Age. Don't get me wrong, I love Jason Voorhees and his ilk, but I'm keen to give others a chance to try and join those ranks with an original character. Unfortunately it never quite seems to work out. _Madison County_'s Damion Yule doesn\u2019t buck that trend.\r\n\r\nThere's some decent individual moments, and I appreciate that the movie took its time to develop, but the quality was too low and the story too unexplored to merit a recommendation.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}], "recommandations_id": [70059, 79078, 48836, 110588], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
