Don't get me wrong, I love Jason Voorhees and his ilk, but I'm keen to give others a chance to try and join those ranks with an original character. Unfortunately it never quite seems to work out. _Madison County_'s Damion Yule doesn\u2019t buck that trend.\r\n\r\nThere's some decent individual moments, and I appreciate that the movie took its time to develop, but the quality was too low and the story too unexplored to merit a recommendation.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}], "recommandations_id": [70059, 110588, 79078, 48836]}
