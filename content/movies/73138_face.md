Naomi Fujiyama gives an impressive performance (her movie debut) as the frumpy, clumsy and socially retarded Masako who one day strangles the pretty sister who loves to torment her. Masako flees from her home and then goes on a journey, both physically and emotionally, which ranges from everything from rape, earthquakes, learning to ride a bicycle, and working in a karaoke bar.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tKbXuc5u3kO969W8OoZA8B121Bj.jpg", "actors": ["Naomi Fujiyama (Masako Yoshimura)", "Etsushi Toyokawa (Hiroyuki Nakagami)", "Michiyo Ookusu (Ritsuko Nakagami)", "Riho Makise (Yukari Yoshimura)", "Jun Kunimura (Kenta Kariyama)", "Nakamura Kanzabur\u014d XVIII (Toshir\u00f4 Yamamoto)", "Misako Watanabe (Mrs. Yoshimura)", "Ittoku Kishibe (Eiichi Hanada)", "Koichi Sato (Akira Ikeda)", "Ai Saotome (Sakiko Kariyama)", "Hajime Tsukumo (Train Conductor)", "Shungiku Uchida (Coffee Shop Woman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [51581, 48341, 42720, 36221], "youtube_key": "duyVhDycumE"}
