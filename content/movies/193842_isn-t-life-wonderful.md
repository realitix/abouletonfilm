It is decided to let Uncle Willie buy a bicycle shop in order to impress Virginia van Stuyden, an American heiress in love with Frank. This pleases Uncle Willie's young nephew, Charles, (who also serves as a commentator throughout the film.) Complications arise when stuffy lord, Sir George Probus, at whose home Virginia is staying, becomes stuffy-Brit shocked when she attends a carnival. Virginia is also irked because Frank isn't more manly. They nearly all turn up at a convalescent home, where Uncle Willie brings the young lovers together, and announces that milk will be his only beverage-of-choice in the future.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z7XHRcMNPuXsDkXm1ctEob0BY3d.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Asher (The Boy)", "Cecil Parker (Charles, the boy's father)", "Eileen Herlie (Isabel, the boy's mother)", "Donald Wolfit (Willie, the boy's uncle)", "Eleanor Summerfield (Kate, Willie's wife)", "Robert Urquhart (Frank, Charles' brother)", "Dianne Foster (Virginia, a young lady from America)", "Henry Hewitt (Arthur, a cousin and clergyman)", "Arthur Young (Sir George Probus, a neighbor)", "Fabia Drake (Lady Probus, wife of Sir George)", "Philip Stainton (Mason, a doctor)", "Cecil Trouncer (Barsmith, another doctor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
