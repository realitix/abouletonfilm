Our society imbues a man's testicles with the constructs of masculinity, sexuality, virility and overall male-hood. So what happens when a man is faced with losing one or both? There are four main incidents that can lead a man to be faced with the removal of a ball - testicular cancer, torsion, an infection, or gender reassignment.
