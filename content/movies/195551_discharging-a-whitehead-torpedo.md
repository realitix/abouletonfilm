This film lasts only 75-seconds but it's almost as if the director wanted to save the best for last. The first sixty-seconds are pretty lifeless as we barely get to see what's going on but once the torpedo is shot off things pick up.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
