It's very interesting. Doesn't have any dull moments. Creates something unique atmosphere. After watching it, I had a desire to watch it again. All Actors are playing well their roles, characters aren't boring. Ending is surprisingly interesting. I think it became one of my favorite movies of all time & I admit, I love well-made indie movies like this. And definitely I'm recommending this movie for the people who seek movies about cults, people's life & mystery, instead of special effects & etc."}], "recommandations_id": [87499, 55420, 50837, 145197], "youtube_key": "U8xElfWyexo"}
