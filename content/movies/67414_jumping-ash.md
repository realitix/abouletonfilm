Shot from the shoulder, the fast-moving world of cops, informers, drug dealers and other crooks are evoked in a very lively and realistic way. The action all takes place in carefully selected locations, among them the walled city of Kowloon and Yuen Long. The film looks like a documentary and evokes the kind of excitement usually seen in news programmes. The story focuses on the battle between two gangs and starts in Amsterdam, where one of the gang leaders is murdered.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x9AZMDkLH5m1nJA1lG91KLZ1vcS.jpg", "actors": ["Josephine Siao ()", "Ga Lun ()", "Michael Chan ()", "Chan Sing ()", "Nick Lam Wai Kei (Tung)", "Lee Yin-Ping ()", "Wu Fung (Doctor Fong)", "Lo Hoi-Pang (Sgt.
