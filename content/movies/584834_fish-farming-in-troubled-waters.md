Unfortunately, overfishing has depleted many fish stocks, and the proposed solution \u2014 fish farming \u2014 is creating far more problems than it solves. Not only are fish farms polluting the aquatic environment and spreading disease to wild fish, farmed fish are also an inferior food source, in part by providing fewer healthy nutrients; and in part by containing more toxins, which readily accumulate in fat.  Farmed Salmon = Most Toxic Food in the World  Salmon is perhaps the most prominent example of how fish farming has led us astray.
