Fittingly returning the image to their lives, director Eric Baudelaire places Adachi and May\u2019s revelatory voiceover reminiscences against warm, fragile Super-8mm footage of their split milieus, Tokyo and Beirut. Grounding their wide-ranging reflections in a solid yet complex reality, Anabasis provides a richly rewarding look at a fascinating, now nearly forgotten era (in politics and cinema), reminding us of film\u2019s own ability to portray\u2014and influence\u2014its landscape.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/48RvIyADNTa3CrGzqajYbVY29mU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
