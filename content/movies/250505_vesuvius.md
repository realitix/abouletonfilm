Based on the assertion that divine apparitions aren\u2019t what they always appear to be, Vesuvius is an interesting take on the psychopath with Catholicism smacked against the background. Gio Alvarez provides a convincing portrayal of a madman, and people can even argue if this short inclines toward the supernatural or the psychological. Whereas Grave Torture uses darkness impeccably, Vesuvius plays with light so well.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wzEPnzoWOPg52v3ENTPXbcx7Twz.jpg", "actors": ["Gio Alvarez ()", "Lauren Young ()", "Rustica Carpio ()", "Alison Segarra ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "4tdoUsf6SrY"}
