Though they have loved each other their whole life, Srintil's gift is driving them apart. The village elders believe that Srintil, a magical dancer called ronggeng, will lead them to order and prosperity. A belief strongly embraced by Srintil, but abhorred by Rasus, because this means she will never only be his. As the country sinks into political turmoil, the young soldier has to choose between his loyalty to the country and his love for Srintil. Their love is tested as they find themselves on opposite sides of history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/llIrBYS5cHPdd9aQh8ZNWOss1Rd.jpg", "actors": ["Prisia Nasution (Srintil)", "Oka Antara (Rasus)", "Slamet Rahardjo (Kartareja)", "Dewi Irawan (Nyai Kartareja)", "Lukman Sardi (Bakar)", "Tio Pakusadewo (Sersan Binsar Harahap)", "Teuku Rifnu Wikana (Darsun)", "Happy Salma (Surti)", "Landung Simatupang (Sakarya)", "Hendro Djarot (Sakum)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [98368], "youtube_key": "Uo9B_xPyc6k"}
