His spiral of debauchery is soon overtaken by madness, and his sex games threaten to harm more than just her social standing and pride... Perhaps the most sadistic and bizarre film in Nikkatsu's lengthy Oniroku Dan/Naomi Tani collaboration, SLAVE WIFE (aka Captured for Sex 3) is a disturbing portrait of a man who\u2019s life as a servant has driven him to revenge and ultimate satisfaction, and the beautiful woman who must endure his perverted wrath. Be warned, the final act is NOT for those who don\u2019t realize how nasty Nikkatsu\u2019s Roman Porno line can get.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9uZoiK1khuTkhhiDqApqvTCwKxZ.jpg", "actors": ["Naomi Tani ()", "Matsuko Yokota ()", "Ikunosuke Koizumi ()", "Akira Hanaue ()", "Akira Takahashi ()", "Y\u00fb Mizushiro ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
