Popularity plunged, and most skaters ditched the sport.  Then came the first of the famous Bones Brigade videos by Powell Peralta.  It was filmed at the beginning of the 1980's skateboard boom and intended to show new skaters what had been going on in the sport.  The Bones Brigade Video Show is definitely old school, and definitely rad. Packed with low riding &amp; sliding action, pink shirts, high shorts, and the top names in skateboarding at the time and even today. The soundtrack, filming, everything - this is one of the best.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/weCFAdY4kdQZ1jfyvQ5ywAncEVY.jpg", "actors": ["Adrian Demain (Himself)", "Chris Iverson (Himself)", "Eddie Reategui (Himself)", "Kevin Staab (Himself)", "Lance Mountain (Himself)", "Mike McGill (Himself)", "Per Welinder (Himself)", "Rodney Mullen (Himself)", "Stacy Peralta (Himself)", "Steve Caballero (Himself)", "Steve Steadham (Himself)", "Todd Hastings (Himself)", "Tony Hawk (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
