Probing roads from El Camino Real, to the Boulevard of Broken Dreams, to the road right outside the front door, Olson crafts a deeply intelligent and transcending observation of the human condition that reaches for redemption in the embrace of history, nostalgia, mindfulness, and sheer beauty. If you give yourself over to it, it will crack you wide open.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/txSklXUVIdwDqomMbmIpiRSEaYN.jpg", "actors": ["Tony Kushner ((archive sound))", "Jenni Olson ((voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
