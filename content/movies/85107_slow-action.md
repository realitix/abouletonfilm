Continuing his exploration of curious and extraordinary environments, Slow Action applies the idea of island biogeography - the study of how species and eco-systems evolve differently when isolated and surrounded by unsuitable habitat - to a conception of the Earth in a few hundred years; the sea level rising to absurd heights, creating hyperbolic utopias that appear as possible future mini-societies.  This series of constructed realities explores the environments of self-contained lands and the search for information to enable the reconstruction of soon to be lost worlds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aiij8IIZ3VABoo3MBiBx8eOQYOE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [121359, 183107, 195630, 162445], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
