She is also cast against type, with Marian having huge breasts and dark hair. Film\u2019s highlight is a lengthy torture scene, rather imaginatively staged by director Richard Kanter in an attempt to outdo the softcore king of s&amp;m Lee Frost, as Sallyforth does all sorts of nasty things to a suspended-in-air Marian.  Many other subplots keep the pot boiling and even manage to engender almost-moving emotions amongst the characters, though the periodic \"stop everything\" to make way for fully-nude sex simulation scenes are more than distracting. It's well-shot by erstwhile cameraman and sometime director Paul Hipp, especially an early scene of Robin humping the wonderful softcore actress Capri, featuring terrific low angle shots of her mighty rack.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1IlP3zHJs6LXx31S8HCKPxe1PSI.jpg", "actors": ["Ralph Jenkins (Robin Hood)", "Dee Lockwood (Maid Marian)", "Steve Vincent (Prince John)", "Lynn Cartwright (Lady Sallyforth)", "Scott Sizemore (Young Robin)", "C.S.
