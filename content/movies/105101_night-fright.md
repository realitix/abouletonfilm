Though it had no scares or suspense whatsoever, and you could tell what was going to happen at least ten minutes before anyone in the film clued in, it had the enjoyability and charm of a period piece, or time capsule, of youth from that era. The instrumentals from the garage band The Wildcats, and watching the teens dance, interact and fight, were the best aspects. You could do worse--and I would much rather watch something like this than a pretentious piece of garbage, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, that Hollywood pumps out by the truckloads these days."}], "recommandations_id": [55602]}
