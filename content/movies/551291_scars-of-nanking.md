Their stories are brought vividly to life through actual real-time letters and diaries as they bear witness to one of the worst wartime atrocities in history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bDJSN6aFtmiqhVQY659sWEDBbA8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
