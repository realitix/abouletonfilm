With hilarious and sometimes tragic consequences, the brotherly bond shared by the trio is forced to come to terms with some unexpected challenges. Interracial marriage, near fatal accidents and stints in prison will test old friendships and family values. A coming of age comedy drama showing the absurdities of life can also be the most amusing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j3GWGS4L016LkdXmj82TXGHBY7n.jpg", "actors": ["Rez Kempton (Amar)", "Sam Vincenti (Akbar)", "Martin Delaney (Tony)", "Karen David (Meera)", "Amrita Acharia (Richa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [464251], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
