Based on a true story, this eloquent and unflinching film charts the journey of a young boy from a war torn Uganda to his days as a soldier with the Ugandan insurgency of 1979, to his HIV positive diagnosis in Cuba, to a present day jail cell in Texas. Ultimately, what we discover is a man who in the face of adversity will do anything to survive, even if it means going to hell.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
