It\u2019s not raunchy like the contemporaneous \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d (except for one line by a teacher early on), but it is adult-oriented as there are several simulated sex scenes between various characters with no nudity. While they\u2019re overt, they\u2019re sorta amusing and fairly essential to the story.\r\n\r\nThis is a must for anyone who\u2019s a high school teacher as it understatedly satirizes the setting. The flick shows how easy it is for a good teacher with years of quality work to make a thoughtless mistake and suddenly fall out of grace. Yet it also shows redemption. Of course the film pokes fun at the election process and the rivalry of candidates, etc. There are a 2-3 laugh-out-loud scenes with Spaghetti Western music blaring (specifically, Ennio Morricone\u2019s score from 1966\u2019 \"Navajo Joe\").          \r\n\r\nWitherspoon is perfect as the female protagonist (although her face looks like Drew Barrymore on the poster), but I never found her alluring. I suppose Frankie Ingrassia (Lisa) and Jessica Campbell (Tammy) make up for it despite the eye-rolling lesbian component, which isn\u2019t very substantive.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 43 minutes and was shot in the Omaha, Nebraska, area (Papillion, Bellevue, LaVista, etc.) and, at the end, Washington DC.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"}], "recommandations_id": [9430, 9434, 13785, 1548]}
