When Raju's dad passes away, the local money-lender gives him an ultimatum to either re-pay the loan or he will take possession of his house and land. Raju decides to hitch a ride to Bombay, get a job, save some money, buy a couple of bullocks, till his land and re-pay the money-lender. No one gives him a ride, so he stows away in the back of a fruit-laden truck, which has one more stowaway, a run-away gypsy named Tarna. Both of them meet, fall in love, promise to help and marry each other. After the truck ride, they board a goods train bound for Bombay, but during the journey both get separated. A few months Raju finds out that Tarna is now known as Meenakshi, a movie actress.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o7wBz2HxvZVKT0W4LyAEqj10g1B.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
