Meanwhile, he and his drinking buddy, a beer-truck driver, go on a jaunt to Poland to recover some gold fillings he had hidden years ago during the time when he worked in a concentration camp. The truck driver inadvertently leaves a filling lying around at home, and his mother immediately recognizes it for what it is. When she confronts him, he claims that \"Jews don't mean anything to me\" and she must then reveal his Jewish heritage to him: she was a housekeeper in a Jewish household and he was a child there whom she adopted during the Holocaust in order to save his life. The driver then confronts the wily old Nazi, who conceives a brutal scheme which will save his cozy life at the expense of the reputations of the driver and his granddaughter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4IjGUzsrCsrRfwlrVs6hGgmVhjg.jpg", "actors": ["Hanna Schygulla (Barbara 'B\u00e4rbel' Hunzinger)", "G\u00fcnther Maria Halmer (Karl Lechner)", "Maria Singer (Lechnerin)", "Karl Friedrich (Probst, B\u00fcrgermeister)", "Otto Tausig (Pfarrer)", "Christiane Blumhoff (K\u00f6chin)", "Sepp Schauer (Polizist)", "Johanna Bittenbinder (Verk\u00e4uferin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
