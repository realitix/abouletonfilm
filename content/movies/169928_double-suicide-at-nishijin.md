An old cop pities her and agrees to be her guarantor so that she could join a Nishijin weaver workshop. Yumi wishes to put her dark past behind her, but she's exposed by an ex-client. Despite the unwavered support of the old cop, she sees no way out and uses her seductive body again to get what she wants. Hiroyuki, her co-worker at the weaver workshop, is a pure-hearted young man who may redeem Yumi from her deadly path as a femme fatale.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rro50OPpm5pGWn553CxUKPB354g.jpg", "actors": ["Yoshie Shimamura (Yumi Nozawa)", "Yoshio Tsuchiya (Yoshida)", "Goichi Yamada (Nomura)", "Akira Nakao (Amano)", "Y\u00f4ko Mihara (Toyo Oshima)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
