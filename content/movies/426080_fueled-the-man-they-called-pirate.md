Set in 1945-47, the protagonist, Tetsuzo Kunioka, is an owner of a company that sells oil. Most of his company is either missing, in the army, or otherwise not available. The fate of the company's network of overseas offices is also unknown. Not fazed by the defeat of Japan, he is determined that Japan will rise again, and is driven to create a large oil company.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nyaAQ5QdmDYs8xSAI2cBlEQLQ7b.jpg", "actors": ["Junichi Okada (Tetsuzo Kunioka)", "Haruka Ayase (Yuki Kunioka)", "Hidetaka Yoshioka (Tadashi Shinonome)", "Shota Sometani (Yoshio Hasebe)", "Ryohei Suzuki (Kotaro Takechi)", "Toru Nomaguchi (Koichi Kashiwai)", "Pierre Taki (Sohei Fujimoto)", "Kaoru Kobayashi (Jisaku Koka)", "Ken Mitsuishi (Kunioka)", "Shinichi Tsutsumi (Tatsuro Morita)", "Masaomi Kondo (Shotaro Kida)", "Jun Kunimura (Takumi Ukawa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "03va5qDFyzY"}
