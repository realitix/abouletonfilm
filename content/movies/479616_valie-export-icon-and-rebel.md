With her shocking public actions she created in the late 60s images that have burned into the general visual memory until today. The life and work of the Austrian artist Valie Export exemplify a development in art history in which women sought and found new ways and means of expression. Her work provides a feminist counterpart to the Viennese actionism of her time, which has influenced numerous artists of subsequent generations. The innovative diversity of her artistic approaches makes Valie Export an icon of 20th century art history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xzwUTpCD9KK3LiEwn0108oMhv7l.jpg", "actors": ["Valie Export (Herself)", "Marina Abramovi\u0107 (Herself)", "Carolee Schneemann (Herself)", "Kiki Smith (Herself)", "Ingrid Wiener (Herself)", "Oswald Wiener (Himself)", "Elfriede Jelinek ()", "Sami Loris (Narrator)", "Elfriede Jelinek (Reader)", "Maren Kroymann ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
