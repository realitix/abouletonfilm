When they are not in school, they generally hang out with their buddy Hsiao Kao, a very stylish and charismatic younger gangster who enjoys their company and support. When one of Hsia Kao's gangland patrons is gunned down, the trio set out to revenge the killing. As a result, the two teens are forced into hiding. One boy tells his dad he wants to go to America, which nearly kills the old man. The other just lays low. When things cool down a bit, they head on up to Taipei, looking for their gangster friend and sampling the gritty pleasures of the capital city's underworld and nightlife. - Clarke Fountain, Rovi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n4AaeQgmylxj2N1LPkA0ryF0IHl.jpg", "actors": ["Chang Shih (The Killer)", "Tsai Chen-Nan ()", "Jack Kao (Hsiao Kao)", "Cheng-Kuo Yen ()", "Tan Chih-Kang ()", "Vicky Wei ()", "Cheung Yee-Haam ()", "Chan Chung-Yung ()", "Li Tian-Lu ()", "Lam Kui ()", "Lui Ming ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
