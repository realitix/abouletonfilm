President George Bush said so\u2026 and now that phrase is echoed everywhere. But are we really \u201caddicted\u201d? Our daily lives are dripping in oil. It\u2019s in virtually everything we use and fuels everything we do. To be sure, it is something to worry about. Are we going to run out? Aren\u2019t we fighting wars for oil? But, if we do slow the flow, how will that change the way we live? When it comes to what we\u2019re told about oil, there\u2019s rhetoric and then there\u2019s reality. Who can we believe? The media? Politicians? Environmental activists? You\u2019d be surprised. For nearly ten years, journalist turned media analyst MARK MATHIS has studied our use of oil. And what he found shocked him so thoroughly that he made a movie about the misinformation, distortions and even outright lies about oil. We do have an \u201coil problem\u201d in America (and the world), but it\u2019s not what you\u2019ve been told. So, it\u2019s time to Fill Up on Truth\u2026 for a change.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jonathan Von (Drug Dealer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "7uJInBagFnc"}
