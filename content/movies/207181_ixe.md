Made to be projected on four screens at once, X is drawn and quartered. At the four points of the compass, at the four ends of the cross, War, Sex, Religion and Drugs, the double exposures, the colliding glimpses the eye barely recognizes, the skillful repetitions of themes, remind us that Sex is also the war of bodies, and the pope, the Drug of the people.  And the story of this young man, shooting up in order to experience all the horror of the world in front of his TV set, reminds us that the heroin orgy is indeed the subjective locus of the monsters of the modern unconscious.\u201d - Guy Hocquenghem", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5eIWp7eY0I6eFvrzvdOTsFtg731.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
