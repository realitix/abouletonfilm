The cinematic journey of Around China with a Movie Camera contains many films which may never have been seen in China, or at the very least not for over 70 years. These travelogues, newsreels and home movies were made by a diverse group of British and French filmmakers, some professionals, but mainly enthusiastic amateurs, including intrepid tourists, colonial-era expatriates and Christian missionaries.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3Q3EE197hZRQEDOgCLp76xqckGo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "dQiEzB-K3i0"}
