Rabbit suggests they take him into the middle of nowhere and leave him overnight. The idea backfires and Rabbit, Piglet and Pooh find themselves lost, but Pooh's tummy guides them home. Then, Tigger and Roo go out for a bounce and get caught in a tree, which Tigger is too afraid to get out of, and Rabbit makes Tigger promise that if they help get Tigger down, that Tigger can never bounce again. So Tigger is rescued and feels sad that he can no longer bounce, but everyone, including Rabbit, agrees they liked the old bouncy Tigger better.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zHJkV0GkAS2FUumDciM6cUuxU1j.jpg", "actors": ["Sebastian Cabot (Narrator (voice))", "Clint Howard (Roo (voice))", "Dori Whitaker (Roo (voice))", "Paul Winchell (Tigger (voice))", "Sterling Holloway (Winnie the Pooh (voice))", "John Fiedler (Piglet (voice))", "Junius Matthews (Rabbit (voice))", "Barbara Luddy (Kanga (voice))", "Timothy Turner (Christopher Robin (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [39268, 66044, 141996, 106973], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
