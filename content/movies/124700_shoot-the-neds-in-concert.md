Although not the original line up, this does not detract. Since 2000, Mat Cheslin &amp; Rat have been replaced by ex-Groundswell members Andy King and Martin Warlow respectively. They both played a blinder at this show, especially Martin who has the unenviable task of filling Rat's boots.\r Shot in widescreen,the concert is captured well on the DVD and the special features are ok too.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hLoEwKQdxzqpjqHVyWIY08A0cFb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
