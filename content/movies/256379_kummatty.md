Kummatty travels from place to place and entertains children with dancing, singing and performing magic. At one such performance at a village, Kummatty starts to mingle with and weave a spell of carefree abandon around the children of the village. He turns a group of children into animals. But one boy, who was changed into a dog, is chased away and misses the moment Kummatty changed the children back to their human form. The dog-boy has to wait a year until Kummatty returns to the village to get back his human form.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eOgDNq3pLN3RUtLjyOpuKOXXqNj.jpg", "actors": ["Ramunni (Kummatty)", "Master Ashokan ()", "Shanker (Shankar)", "Vakkil ()", "Sivasankaran Divakaran ()", "Kuttyedathi Vilasini ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ScyoXiMIzG0"}
