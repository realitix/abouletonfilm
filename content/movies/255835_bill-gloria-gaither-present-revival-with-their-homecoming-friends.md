Songs of revival are the most exciting of all. They have energy. They have power to move us to tears and make us shout for the sheer joy of being truly alive. This Gaither Homecoming video will recall for the times when God's presence invaded your dry places and suddenly you knew \"resurrection\" was more than just a word.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aslhxOrUt99q267eXX9mTtC5DR6.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Gaither (Bill Gaither)", "Gloria Gaither (Gloria Gaither)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
