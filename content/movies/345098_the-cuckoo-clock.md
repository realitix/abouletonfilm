In 1815 Italy, a rich banker is killed under strange circumstances. The motive seems to be to get hold of some gold hidden inside a cuckoo clock. Vittorio De Sica heads the cast of this complex mystery, in which a huge, American-manufactured cuckoo clock is purchased by a European banker for the express purpose of smuggling gold into England. Set during the early 19th century, \"The Cuckoo Clock\" is lovely to look at but a bit thin dramatically. This Italian historical melodrama was acquired for US distribution by MGM-who promptly shelved the film for several months in reflection of mounting anti-Mussolini sentiments in the US.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A8fXqAlUDAZYtxB83fVzpoKYnVy.jpg", "actors": ["Vittorio De Sica ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
