Anyways, this movie is pretty messed up since the story follows a horrible drug dealer father that drinks and rapes his own daughters in some dirty house in the woods but if you are a thriller / horror fan and also enjoy scenes that can be hard to watch by the average hollywood movie watcher then you need to check this film out! This is one of those films that you end up watching once and possibly can't watch again due to how sick the movie can be sometimes but that does not mean I regret watching it because I am glad I saw this despite some negative reviews from movie watchers that prefer transformers or some ghost movie. Anyways, go ahead and rent this flick to see if you can handle the first 15-20 minutes because if you do, then you can finish the whole movie! So glad I rented this because I never heard anything about this film until the other day by watching the trailer on amazon and rented it as soon as I realized it was a foreign film since horror / thriller foreign films have been on a roll lately for these past several years. Also, I have to give MAJOR props to Siboney Lo and Carolina Escobar for putting on an amazing performance while doing many crazy things throughout the film since this film is not for everyone. If you have seen the classic foreign film, \"Martyrs\" and you could handle that type of movie then you can handle \"Hidden in the Woods\" aka \"En las afueras de la ciudad\""}], "recommandations_id": [33156, 30796, 103696, 15652]}
