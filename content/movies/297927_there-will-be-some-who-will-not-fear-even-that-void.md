Rather than looking at our influence on the environment, ...Even That Void examines the environment's influence on us - emotionally, psychologically and ethically. The film suggests that the limits to exploring and dominating nature are no longer technological, but moral. We now have the technology to 'conquer' virtually any part of the planet if we want to - the question is no longer 'can we' but 'should we'?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/44YVgQHLKJTDLo8ABdkwtgxJSXv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
