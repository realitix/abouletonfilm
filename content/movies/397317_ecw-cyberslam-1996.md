As I can and will likely say a lot around this time, ECW is a promotion in constant transition. Last month they said goodbye to the Public Enemy, Cactus Jack is the next of the big names to get swallowed up by the big two. On the flip side, the New York taping a a couple of weeks prior to the show saw the debut of Bam Bam Bigelow (who was still under contract with the WWF) and this show would see the redebut of Brian Pillman (who did appear for the promotion in 1994). A lot has changed since then, mind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/joGsoblx8zRRtpbK1aBPLqNjYGR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
