Two young lovers, Claudio and Hero, are to be married imminently but the devious scheming of a resentful Prince looks set to thwart the nuptials.  Meanwhile, marriage seems inconceivable for reluctant lovers Beatrice and Benedick whose endless witty sparring threatens to keep them apart forever.  Directed by Josie Rourke, Artistic Director of the Donmar Warehouse, Much Ado About Nothing is one of Shakespeare\u2019s great plays and reminds us all of the failings and triumphs of the human condition in our never ending search for perfect love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gO7IRVdaBKQk2F7Jlw894i0Om16.jpg", "actors": ["David Tennant (Benedick)", "Catherine Tate (Beatrice)", "Adam James (Don Pedro)", "Elliot Levey (Don John)", "Tom Bateman (Claudio)", "Jonathan Coy (Leonato)", "Enzo Squillino Jr. (Balthasar)", "Alex Beckett (Borachio)", "Sarah MacRae (Hero)", "John Ramm (Dogberry)", "Clive Hayward (Friar Francis)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [112666, 26911, 267821, 203912], "youtube_key": "zjmqSJ0ElNs"}
