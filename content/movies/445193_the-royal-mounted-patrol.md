When villainous lumberman Frenchy Duvalle (Donald Curtis) refuses to limit his wood-chopping activities, he inadvertently touches off a forest fire. Trapped in the middle of the conflagration, Frenchy's only hope for rescue is mountie Tom Jeffries (Charles Starrett), presently scouring the countryside in his scout plane. Jeffries' reasons for bringing Frenchy out safely are twofold: he must deliver the renegade lumberjack to the authorities, and he happens to be in love with Frenchy's sister Betty (Wanda McKay).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7OkUYiMgGCUqlzb9g725kVywRFT.jpg", "actors": ["Charles Starrett (Tom Jeffries)", "Russell Hayden (Lucky Lawrence)", "Wanda McKay (Betty Duvalle)", "Donald Curtis (Frenchy Duvalle)", "Lloyd Bridges (Hap Andrews)", "Evan Thomas (Commander)", "Ted Adams (Pete)", "Harrison Greene (Office manager)", "Kermit Maynard (Sgt.
