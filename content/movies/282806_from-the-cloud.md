But even well before then, the web had made a large variety of new materials accessible to see and to download, as well as upload. \u201cFrom the Cloud\u201d is a video program that looks at found footage \u201cfilms\u201d in the Internet Age. The proliferation of archived photographs, digital images, and videos made available to everyone online as well as an exponential increase in production has changed the way artists interact with pre-existing material. The artists in this program both pull material from the cloud and implicitly comment on the cloud by doing so.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nwQaPYs0Tamy5aI2g9bm42NeGYJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
