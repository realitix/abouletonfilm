He would retain a strong impression of his encounter with the highly organised local workers, whose \u201cequalitarian relationships and independent thought\u201d he would praise in his diary. 140 years after the \u201cconversion\u201d of this man who was to theorise libertarian communism a little later on, Cyril Sch\u00e4ublin restages fragments of this diary read in Russian, in the current setting. A place in which his ancestors, who worked from generation to generation in the watchmaking manufactures of this region until their closure, still survive.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xzC6LCpoZnkYcy4Hb7j9bvGp3KK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
