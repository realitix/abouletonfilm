Exploring the decades-long campaign by the Nobel Prize winner, filmmaker Maurice Fitzpatrick reveals how Hume - inspired by Martin Luther King - became the moral architect for peace in Northern Ireland.\r In the Name of Peace: John Hume in America is a compelling feature documentary, narrated by Liam Neeson, with dramatic footage and stirring interviews with Presidents Clinton and Carter, US senators and congressmen, and Irish and British leaders.  With a musical score by Bill Whelan (Riverdance), this beautiful film reminds us of the redemptive powers of politics to overcome division. It is a timely story that profiles creative leadership, international cooperation and the U.S. contribution to peace and stability on the island of Ireland.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zeO6DvTy22GGdX68MKZzZ3mSoY.jpg", "actors": ["Bono (Himself)", "Jimmy Carter (Himself)", "Tony Blair (Himself)", "Bill Clinton (Himself)", "Liam Neeson (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
