The classics, for the one you love UFO today but all were already published that have not yet reached a little more focused on more pop songs phase of the early eighties, and then Englishman present in this WDR Rockpalast recording in very good shape and as a bone-dry , no-frills hard rock band, impressed their game and songwriting even 30 years later.  Especially the hits \"Lights out\", \"rock bottom\" and \"Doctor, Doctor\" ensure goosebumps. Sound and image (of course 4:3) in public service TV quality guarantee best entertainment, and only the lean Ausstatttung is somewhat disappointing: Were there no interviews, no backstage footage? An excellent live document of an exceptional band.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yqlPmhArrzjjwVT4mflxaHNTN7N.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
