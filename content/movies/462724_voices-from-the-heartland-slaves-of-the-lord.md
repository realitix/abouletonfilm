Becoming convinced that she is impure, and growing increasingly scared and depressed, she forces herself into an endless ritual of cleaning, while attempting to silence the whispering inner obsessional thoughts that are detailing every inch of her relentless guilt, over and over again. To make matters worse, Tamar's only friend, Rachel, lures her into sinful mischief: peeping into the Mikveh (bath house), turning a light on during the Sabbath. The girls even dare to secretly bathe at the Mikveh when Tamar gets her first period. Will Tamar succumb to her fears? A dark and unflinching portrayal of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and the inner turmoil of an adolescent girl.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kN9hc4Z6lvIXOWNuI1dGwzH8zUI.jpg", "actors": ["Maya Eshet (Tamar)", "Irit Sheleg ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
