Lucky, an illegal immigrant from Ghana, makes ends meet by soliciting shoppers on the street with knock-off brand merchandise. Levon, an Armenian-Lebanese immigrant, operates an illegal storefront with a concealed back room where counterfeit goods are showcased to interested shoppers. Lucky's world is suddenly turned upside down when a child is thrust into his life by a woman who insists the toddler is his son. While Lucky copes with his new domestic dilemma, Levon struggles to save a marriage that is falling apart. The seedy side of the wholesale district is revealed through a journey that continually confronts the interplay between what is fake and what is real.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qJ5hHh9AaF4R3yyfTV9SzGXVQN3.jpg", "actors": ["Prince Adu (Lucky)", "Karren Karagulian (Levon Krikorian)", "Aiden Noesi (Prince)", "Keyali Mayaga (Karina)", "Kat Sanchez (Linda)", "Victoria Tate (Nadia)", "Chris Bergoch (Snowbound Victim)", "Brea Cola (Serena)", "Roger Harkavy (Defense Attorney)", "Adesuwa Addy Iyare (Herself)", "Curtz Jackson (Himself, customer)", "Kurt Leitner (Davenport)", "Cindy Lopez (Duana)", "Mark Newell (Undercover Cop)", "Edwin Norteye (Ralphie)", "Mickey O'Hagan (Snowbound Victim's girlfriend (as Michael Adrienne O'Hagan))", "Justen Oriolo (Size 13)", "Edward Pagan (Hector)", "Anthony Roach (DNA Doctor (as Tony Roach))", "Joel Saladino (Undercover cop)", "Allison Carter Thomas (Midwestern Tourist)", "Mala Wright (Customer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
