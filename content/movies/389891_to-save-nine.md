Piera Degli Esposti plays the widowed, impoverished mother of a huge farm family. The woman moves her nine children to Bologna, where their living conditions are deplorable. To avoid a hike in rent, she tells her landlady (Dominique Sanda) that she is living alone. Also known as To Save Nine (a curiously brief English-language title for a Wertmuller film!), IL Decimo Clandestino was expanded from 60 to 90 minutes for its theatrical release.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8uhll9fUrhVByECSIbVz7VjfTfB.jpg", "actors": ["Piera Degli Esposti (Marcella Baralli)", "Dominique Sanda (Dame)", "Hartmut Becker (Herr)", "Susanna Marcomeni (Piera)", "Giorgio Trestini (Tognone)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
