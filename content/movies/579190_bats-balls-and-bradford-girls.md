The team started at school four years ago when their only experience of cricket was their dads and brothers watching it on the TV. In spite of this, they took to it like naturals and began winning almost all of the tournaments they entered. Last year they lost out on becoming National champions at Lords by only one run.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qET9ZWjHWGpYpoYn62XXoJZQmTR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
