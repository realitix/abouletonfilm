He is a sadist, a pervert and treats his own mother like a slave worker and swears at her. He is always on the look out to make a fast buck and has no qualms about doing dirty jobs for others; provided he is paid.  One day he walks into a marriage pandal and is able to get a sneak view of the bride Poovu (Namitha) as she is dressing up for the marriage. Instantly Pacha takes a liking to her. He beats up the groom, marries the poor girl and takes her to bed after telling his shell-shocked mother and other women that he isn't going to wait until after they are married to have sex with her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xIF1CYfzGBpreu7wwJV0XTJUZLt.jpg", "actors": ["Namitha ()", "Parthiban ()", "Latha Rao ()", "Raj Kamal ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
