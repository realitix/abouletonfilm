A seal basks beside its hole under a warming sun. The hunter stalks the seal, kills it and drags it to the family camp on shore. Man and wife skin the seal, cutting the hide into rings that girdle the body. Stripped of blubber, the rings are then cut spirally into long thongs. The boy plays on the shingle imitating the circling gulls, while the man stretches his thongs between rocks and scrapes away the fur. The woman dresses the seal, wasting nothing, braiding the intestines.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sbl8Stc0QsOHe6ms8CVpkAGCHvb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
