A dancer and a singer perform a duet with Taeuber\u2019s marionettes and revive Dada as a collective art \u2013 still fresh and experimental after 100 years of its appearance.  The masking of dancer and singer bring to mind the courage of Sophie Taeuber. Despite the threat of dismissal from the School of Applied Arts she continued performing as a dadaist \u2013 henceforth, dancing with mask and pseudonym.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
