At its heart is a now-familiar pattern of military action \u2013 new and hard-learned in the First World War \u2013 in which control of the airspace assumes as much strategic importance as the campaign on the ground. This desire for panoramic overview, to rise beyond the deadlock of the trenches, brings with it its own rapid advances (in camera optics and other technological innovations) but also its counter-measures, as armies seek to hide their movements and positions from this ever-present eye-in-the-sky. Alluding to the unceasing threat of exposure from above, Undead Sun highlights these earthbound, subterranean arts of concealment and camouflage, as well as the unremarked, invisible contribution made by women to this facet of the war.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gJoB5k4hTaMTpHR6PErldEEPV9L.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
