Serra presents her unique vision of eroticism and poetic cinema in a fast-paced collage of dreamlike imagery. Fragments of a poem by C. Breeze are read and manipulated in a manner recalling the tape experiments of Steve Reich. Rich reds and deep blues stutter and sparkle along with her descriptions of love and \"canine sex.\" TURNER is a brief glimpse at Serra's roots in the New York avant-garde and the Film-makers' Cooperative.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8FfPI8RMmfQRGsdlkxh0XDdCpUJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
