Everything that we later saw in the Korean, Vietnam and, most recently, the Gulf Wars - from water boarding to search-and-destroy tactics - already happened during the USA\u2019s first major 'civilizing mission' abroad, as it was sold to the public at the time.  Memories of a Forgotten War is an experimental take on that behemoth of a hole in history: a hybrid between documentary and fiction, a weaving of stories in which stylised historical recreations, interview attempts with unwitting present-day US citizens (one of them wondering in all seriousness whether the war was fought over rice- eating preferences!), oral history and animation all have their place.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
