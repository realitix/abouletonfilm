This film touches on the fragile process of unveiling memories by one of these former prisoners who remembers his story and that of his companions. In a visual echo, the places of their confinement come one after another denuded from any traces of that past.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lzD2WnbOfFXsJtqwHhCruiwew3d.jpg", "actors": ["B\u00e2 Fara ((voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
