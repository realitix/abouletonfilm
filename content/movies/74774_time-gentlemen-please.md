The \"almost\" is because of Dan Dance (Eddie Byrne), an old rogue who would rather drink and philosophize than work. The Village Council are determined to have a perfect record so they connive to have the old man put into the alms-house which has been unoccupied for many years, where he must abide by rules laid down 400 years ago. A new Vicar arrives and discovers that, because of the circumstances created by the Council, Dan Dance is entitled to 6,000 pounds a year at the expense of the village.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j5qmKDUpViw09T6ufLEzhgJFRyk.jpg", "actors": ["Eddie Byrne (Dan Dance)", "Jane Barrett (Sally)", "Robert Brown (Bill Jordan)", "Sid James (Eric Hace)", "Hermione Baddeley (Emma Stebbins)", "Thora Hird (Alice Crouch)", "Marianne Stone (Mrs Pincer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
