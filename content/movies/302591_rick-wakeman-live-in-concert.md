Recorded during Wakeman's 2000 U.K. tour, he performs the entire set solo, often chatting with the audience (and he proves to be quite comical, telling a Spinal Tap-esque story of a concert from the mid-'70s that went terribly wrong due to overdrinking and faulty stage props). Included are such highlights as a medley of Yes' \"And You and I\"/\"Wondrous Stories,\" a new age reworking of the Beatles' \"Help\" and \"Eleanor Rigby,\" as well as such solo favorites as \"Catherine Howard\"/\"Catherine of Aragon,\" \"Jane Seymour,\" and \"The Recollection\"/\"Dance of a Thousand Lights.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aqOiJSuhSCbZsqdwj2yjpeZoDcM.jpg", "actors": ["Rick Wakeman (Keyboard)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
