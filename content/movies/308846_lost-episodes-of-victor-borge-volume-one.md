The disc contains a standard full-frame transfer. The English soundtrack does what it can with the limited quality of the source materials. This is an excellent disc for those who count themselves fans of Borge's singular style, as well as for people looking for a title the whole family can enjoy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iKYYQkGvQTqxh8ahy8p9bLWylb4.jpg", "actors": ["Victor Borge (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
