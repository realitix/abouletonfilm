He is a scamp with a heart of gold. He causes havoc in the classroom pouring ink over his teacher yet when a polio-crippled boy joins the class Ciske is one of the only children to befriend him and is bullied as a result. His mother works in a bar and Ciske helps out often late into the night - his father is at sea and his mother supplements her income with prostitution. Ciske is also a very angry young man and he smoulders with rage at life's injustices.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uDb8CPH4tMHyonhWetu4NuHXatD.jpg", "actors": ["Danny de Munk (Ciske Vrijmoeth / Ciske de Rat)", "Willeke van Ammelrooy (Moeder Marie)", "Herman van Veen (Meester Bruis)", "Willem Nijholt (Oom Henri)", "Peter Faber (Vader Cor)", "Rijk de Gooyer (Rechercheur Muyskens)", "Linda van Dyck (Tante Jans)", "Carolien van den Berg (Tante Chris)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [48449, 40071, 2764, 138284], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
