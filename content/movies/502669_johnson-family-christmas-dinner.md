While the conceited Sam obnoxiously flaunts his success before brother Robert, Robert himself grapples with alcoholism. Meanwhile, Candy shocks the more traditional family members by inviting her vegan boyfriend to dinner, and Aunt Michelle buckles beneath the weight of loneliness and prays aloud for a man to come into her life. These events and others all add up to a bittersweet mixture of humor and pathos, laced with Christian sentiments.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2SQByx6CS1RNZwB570sRYBV2SiT.jpg", "actors": ["Lynne Conner Smith (Mom)", "Jerard Jones (Sam)", "Toni Thai Sterrett (Hilary)", "Ashlei Shyne (Melanie)", "Kevin Shannon (Robert Jr.)", "Micol Bartolucci (Lucy)", "Dylan Mooney (Money Mike)", "Paris Scott (Stacy)", "Elvada Seleithia (Shane)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "JjB989Wd1hg"}
