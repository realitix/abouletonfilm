From then on, whether as a successful corporate attorney, church leader in the Los Angeles ares or apostle of the Lord, Howard's life was dedicated to serving others. His focus on temple service began as a young bishop and carried through to his presidency as he challenged the Church membership to increase temple worthiness and attendance.
