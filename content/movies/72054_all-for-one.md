Martin is a policeman, while Nikolai, Ralf, and Timo can't distinguish between personal possessions and the possessions of others! When all four find themselves in a fix, they're forced to return to their former tricks against a common foe, Mr Niemeyer. Martin is not as successful, however, either at his job or marriage, and thinks he deserves a better life. Now he sees an opportunity to save his career by \"playing\" with his old friends on a mission that is so crazy that even the two foolish brothers can do some good.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cKikIufxCbwfm3hURGQGQaoIZLT.jpg", "actors": ["Mick \u00d8gendahl (Ralf Lieberman)", "Jonatan Spang (Nikolaj)", "Rasmus Bjerg (Timo)", "Jon Lange (Martin)", "S\u00f8ren Malling (Revisor)", "Lisa Werlinder (Sofie)", "Charlotte Fich (Line)", "S\u00f8ren Vejby (H\u00e5ndlanger)", "Kurt Ravn (Arno Lieberman)", "Rutger Hauer (Niemeyer)", "Mille Dinesen (Niemeyers kone)", "Gordon Kennedy (Toke)", "Signe Anastassia Mannov (Helle)", "Stinne Hedrup (Gallerit\u00f8sen)", "Torben Brinck (Elektriker)", "Ole Thestrup ()", "Karen Lis Ahrenkiel ()", "Victoria Sparrevohn ()", "Gitte Ertbirk ()", "Ib Petersen ()", "Jesper \u00d8hlenschl\u00e6ger ()", "Karen-Helene Hjort ()", "Roberto Coronado ()", "Roberto Coronado ()", "Henrik M\u00f8ller ()", "Dan Nielsen ()", "Carlos Martinez (Yin / Yang)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [168510, 48746, 89877, 15149], "youtube_key": "ZU8xZB01J08"}
