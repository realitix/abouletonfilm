My gf and I appeared to be the only ones in the theater without kids. And the auditorium was full. The movie is very kid centric and does not rely on crude or off color humor to keep the adults interested. Many, many times the kids laughed out loud. As did many adults. And much to my surprise, a good majority of the audience applauded at t he end. I've seen a few movies where some of the audience clapped.  But not one where the vast majority did. I recommend it going and seeing it if you have kids. And even if you don't."}], "recommandations_id": [346648, 364689, 370567, 407451]}
