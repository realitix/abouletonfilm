He lives far away from the noise and hassle, in a self-chosen exile by the sea. His difficult faith befalls Lote - the loving and silent wife of the artist. The anglers of the village are compassionate and they help them. One morning guests from the capital arrive. They want to buy the unfinished art piece at any price. The moment is dramatic. The artist wants to finish what he has started but Lote knows that he is possessed by this piece and he will never finish it. One must decide. Hristo is still not sure. Little Patricia came with her parents to visit the artist. Her look turns into a moral judge for the adults. With pain and suffering, Hristo gives his creation away.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Ak57ZHia77FU8xjUEWCauzVg0qP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
