They trade their car and $300 for a \"new\" boat which turns out to be a piece of junk that soon falls apart and sinks in the middle of the ocean. Luckily the boys also have a row boat which they climb into and then try to signal some passing planes for help. Unfortunately, their paint spattered rag is mistaken for a Japanese flag and they are bombed from the sky.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/20tgKbqAzbX2hlxOtDq6NzfJiiT.jpg", "actors": ["Curly Howard (Curly)", "Larry Fine (Larry)", "Moe Howard (Moe)", "Rebel Randall (Captain's Girl)", "Vernon Dent (Captain)", "Gene Courtney (Bathing Beauty)", "Lola Gogan (Bathing Beauty)", "Wanda Perry (Bathing Beauty)", "'Snub' Pollard (Ice Cream Vendor)", "John Tyrrell (Boat Man)", "Dorothy Vernon (Woman Customer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
