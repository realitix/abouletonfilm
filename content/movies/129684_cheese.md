Floating through a pastoral yet mazelike setting of raw wooden debris cobbled together into a benign shantytown, six longhaired women in flowing white nightgowns \u201cmilk\u201d their locks and the goats they live with to generate cheese. Shots of animals crowded in pens and the sisters\u2019 bunk bed\u2013 cluttered room visually compare the women to their ruminant allies. As nurturing caretakers, these women represent maternal aspects of Mother Nature.
