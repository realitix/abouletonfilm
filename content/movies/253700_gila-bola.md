In the present day, he works as a dispatch rider and during his free time he is the water boy for a football team called Luncai FC. The players of the team are also his friends. But in a chance situation where one of his friends, Lisa, was bullied during a tournament, Damak decides to take her place, not withstanding the harassment from the opposing team, the Red Dragon. Seeing skills never thought existed in Damak, his friends push him to be one of their players in the next match. Daniel, the leader of the Red Dragon, realized the potential in Damak and felt threatened. In an attempt to keep his team's winning title as champions of the tournament, Daniel persuades his girlfriend Rini to seduce and distract Damak, and further luring him into joining the Red Dragon team.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oOWQlGrkGLAEEEwtCnoHCG4Kfjo.jpg", "actors": ["Fazley Yaakob (Damak)", "Linda Onn (Lisa)", "Opie Zami (Burruchaga)", "Saiful Apek (Luncai)", "Syanie (Mimie)", "Cico Harahap (Adam)", "Julia Hana (Rini)", "Acappan (Jimi Jendrix)", "Ako Mustapha (Daniel)", "Aziz M.
