What made those nights so special wasn\u2019t just the music\u2014because that\u2019s always special at an Ani show\u2014but the fact that she was playing the inaugural shows in her very own venue, a downtown church once slated for demolition that has been beautifully restored as a state-of-the-art music hall and newly renamed \u201cBabeville.\u201d Ani took the opportunity to fashion a two-night retrospective of sorts, performing songs from every stage of her fabled career in breathtaking new arrangements with her latest touring band; Allison Miller on drums, Todd Sickafoose on upright bass and Mike Dillon on vibes and percussion. The spirit of celebration was in the air, and energy in the room-both onstage and in the audience\u2014was extraordinary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ub1CHsRqLYlVe4p4sBZzHfcCd3q.jpg", "actors": ["Ani DiFranco (Herself)", "Todd Sickafoose (Himself)", "Allison Miller (Herself)", "Mike Dillon (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
