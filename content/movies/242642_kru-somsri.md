Somsri is also the leader of a slum committee, organized primarily to fight the property development company that is trying to evict the people from their homes. Somsri is idealistic, proud and strong-headed and determined to organize the residents and fight the company every step of the way. Unfortunately, many or most of the residents are reluctant to fight, accepting the idea that as slum people they have no rights and can't possibly win against a big corporation. The fight is a difficult one as the company is not afraid to use nasty tactics against the people that stand in the way of their profits.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lwhCh8MJcxgzeNvzxnxZoCY8nCF.jpg", "actors": ["Chalita Puttamapun (Somsri)", "Ron Ritthichai (Boonpeng)", "Sor Asanajinda (School Master)", "Settha Sirachaya (Attorney Thongdee)", "Chalit Fuengarom (Attorney Klod)", "Poom Patanayuth (Dusit)", "Manee Maneewan ()", "Wut Kongkakhet ()", "Surachai Dilokwilas ()", "Chanida Piemsuwan ()", "Jirawadee Isarangkul Na Ayutthaya ()", "Kanchit Kwanpracha ()", "Ornprapa Wongsaroj ()", "Rueng Phanom ()", "Jinda Thinnakorn ()", "Joy Satrasook ()", "Saipin Loukbangluang ()", "Thep Methin ()", "Saphol Charbsuwan ()", "Art Bangkrapi ()", "Mod A.V.
