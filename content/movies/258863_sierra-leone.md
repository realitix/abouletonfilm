He is filled with confidence and optimism for a new start. He has brought home with him a pile of money that he made in Africa. But he never wrote to his wife Rita. He only wired her a money transfer every month. In the meantime, Rita has a new life that she now shares with a GI. Fred rents a room in the \"Royal\", a sleazy hotel. There, he meets Alma, who takes care of the rooms and the guests and who is being kept by her sugar daddy - the aging hotel director. A passionate encounter with his old girlfriend Vera, who had high hopes for the two of them at some earlier time, dissipates into a brief carnal episode", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tl97P1Yoh7FkklX0yQeVjZ1yVvN.jpg", "actors": ["Christian Redl (Fred)", "Rita Russek (Vera)", "Ann-Gisel Glass (Alma)", "Constanze Engelbrecht (Rita)", "Janette Rauch (Kinderschwester)", "Michael Sch\u00f6nborn (Wolf)", "Rainer Pigulla (Werkstattmeister)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
