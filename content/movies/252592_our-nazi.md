Kramer\u2019s confronting film is an essay about the sticky complicity of everyone present at this event, each bringing their own history, their own political ideology, their own desires to take revenge, to seek redemption or compassion, or just to put their heads down and \u2018get the job done\u2019 professionally, or (in the case of Filbert) to be a star, a part of the magnificent, magical, seductive world of cinema, even if it kills him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fJpgC0fxQm9WzhVWGXADvHoqivF.jpg", "actors": ["Albert Filbert (Himself)", "Henri Alekan (Himself)", "Thomas Harlan (Himself)", "Heike Geschonneck (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
