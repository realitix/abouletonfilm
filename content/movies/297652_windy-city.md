A virtual \"B\" movie in terms of popularity, it is one of my favorites. It follows the life and times of several men, from boyhood to their adult lives...and the changes that occur in those relationships over time. This movie has a real Chicago feel (I'm born and raised here) and in my opinion is a refined \"About Last Night.\" There is deeper meaning and developments of the relationships, and the ending ought to bring a tear to one's eye. John Shea is absolutely outstanding."}], "recommandations_id": []}
