It's the spitting image of the harmless nerd. A gang of starstruck crooks sees our hapless hero, mistakes him for the Fiend, rescues him from imminent arrest and more or less forces him to lead a desperate criminal scheme they've got going. And finally, the poor little man becomes enamoured of the idea, decides for once in his sad life to be a tough guy and a hero. He surrenders to his bizarre destiny, to be \"The Fiend of Athens\"...  O Drakos is brilliant: a dark, satirical noir masterpiece... is like a French New Wave picture crossed with a British Ealing comedy, with something of Fellini in its zinging energy, and Carol Reed's Odd Man Out and The Third Man. The stark, dramatic key-lighting in the \"arrest\" scene gives the imagery a Weegee-type crime-scene aesthetic...", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5zo10mGTeCsPbdmz9hv7wnJnGW8.jpg", "actors": ["Dinos Iliopoulos (Thomas)", "Margarita Papageorgiou (Roula)", "Giannis Argyris (Hondros)", "Thanasis Vengos (Spathis)", "Marika Lekaki (Carmen)", "Kostas Stavrinoudakis (villain)", "Frixos Nassou ()", "Kostas Stavrinoudakis ()", "Manolis Vlachakis ()", "Kostas Spagopoulos ()", "Zizi Viopoulou ()", "Kassi Janet ()", "Andreas Douzos ()", "Savvas Kalantzis ()", "Notis Pitsilos ()", "Nikos Tsachiridis ()", "Alekos Tzanetakos ()", "Anestis Vlahos ()", "Zannino ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [115596, 126644, 184868, 81321], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
