Herbert (Heinz Lieven) is a solid, middle-class engineer who one day quits his job and ensconces himself at home (preferably in the bathroom), refusing to say very much to anyone. His wife (Dorothea Moritz ) is all the more upset at his behavior because on Sunday mornings he goes out into the street and yells at the top of his lungs for everyone to \"get up.\" Eventually, the hard-working wife who is also earning their support convinces Herbert to go to a clinic for treatment. But is it a clinic he needs? Or is Herbert rebelling against a society that is too ordered, too sterile, too buried in the monotony of routine?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/62cFPwUY9lbEDUeTyIfcjxs5Cib.jpg", "actors": ["Heinz Lieven (Herbert Sladovsky)", "Dorothea Moritz (Maria Sladovsky)", "Ingrid Domann (Heidi)", "Peter Sch\u00fctze (J\u00fcrgen)", "Dagmar Hessenland (\u00c4rztin)", "Dieter Schaad (Oberarzt)", "Dieter Reifarth (Pfleger)", "Karl Luzius ()", "M\u00e1rta Holler ()", "Kurt Schmengler ()", "Klaus Gr\u00fctz ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
