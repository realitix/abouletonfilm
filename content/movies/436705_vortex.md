Vortex is an event with neither narration nor beginning nor end. A meteorological phenomenon takes place in the exhibition room. An effect for a Hollywood disaster blockbuster where everything is revealed. Bertrand Lamarche shows a particular interest in \u201cwhirlpools\u201d and \u201cvortices\u201d through devices with produce effects of ambience, total-immersion, subverting household materials and hardware. He is fascinated by thresholds, openings to infinity: whirlwinds, maelstroms and tidal waters, vortices or again gigantic urban agglomerations, the cities of tomorrow sometimes calling to mind playthings or giant models. He focuses on \u201chollow bodies\u201d, pockets of emptiness existing in the real: tunnels, demolition sites, quarries but also tornados, black holes and ditches or channels of smaller dimensions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3I6hHvJMQQ8YWuSSSZ71kavWFkr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
