Cort plays a documentary director, seeking to produce a film on the life of controversial ballet star Vaslav Nijinsky. He finds his goal of objectivity blocked by Nijinsky's elderly real-life daughter Kyra, who is as stocky as her father was sylph-like. Kyra's uncompromising insistence on total control over the project literally shapes (and frequently distorts) the film before our eyes. Adding to the Pirandellian atmosphere of the Australian-produced She Dances Alone is Max Von Sydow, also playing \"himself.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dYI74r2uiZe70U7E0YdTErARJWw.jpg", "actors": ["Kyra Nijinsky ()", "Patrick Dupond ()", "Max von Sydow ()", "Sauncy LeSueur ()", "Rosine Bena ()", "Jeanette Etheridge ()", "Franco DeAlto ()", "Laura Hoover ()", "Walter Kent ()", "Bud Cort ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
