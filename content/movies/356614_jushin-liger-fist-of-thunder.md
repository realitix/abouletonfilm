Helping him is a woman photographer named Miki Aizawa  While Liger copes with his childhood fears, he gets ready for the three-way wrestling match. When the big fight begins on that night, the fight seems tough for Liger as he realizes that there's something very peculiar about Bounty Viper. He has demonic powers, similar to the demons that persecuted him as a child. In the course of the fight, Viper displays his wickedness by violently maiming Riot Orff. Liger eventually becomes violent, and when he and Viper tear into each other, both wrestlers begin to pulsate and glow with energy. In light speed, they dash out of the ring into a deserted street where they transform into demonic versions of themselves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gobtolRh8HuDNipAQvv1bEk7OzX.jpg", "actors": ["Keiichi Yamada (Jushin Thunder Liger)", "Masaru Matsuda (Liger (Unmasked))", "Reiko Kataoka (Miki Aizawa)", "Muscle Kitamura (Bounty Viper)", "Shinjiro Otani (Riot Orff)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
