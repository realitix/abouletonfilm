The 19 vassals of Lord Hosokawa ask permission to commit harakiri with him, as a demonstration of their loyalty. Only Yaichiemon Abe is refused permission, forced instead into the vassalage of his lord\u2019s successor. Humiliated and derided, Yaichiemon eventually commits harakiri without permission. His eldest son is then punished for Yaichiemon\u2019s suicide, and when he resists, is sentenced to death. The entire Abe clan rebels upon the son\u2019s execution, and the clan is annihilated.\u201d --Alan Poul, Japan Society", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bEuwMLtvGgO2rcC0fmRbTdUXcgT.jpg", "actors": ["Kan'emon Nakamura ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
