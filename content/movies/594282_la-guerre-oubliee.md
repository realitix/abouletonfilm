In English, La Guerre oubli\u00e9e means The Forgotten War. Here, we talk about the 1914-18 big thing. This documentary doesn't use old footage, but actors to show us some parts of that war in Quebec. Joe Bocan sings some songs of that period and makes the narrations. There's also some rare veterans of the war who talk.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nfP4ghMro56tnjfUPZ2RIO0Bn1k.jpg", "actors": ["Joe Bocan (La Madelon)", "Eudore Belzile (Le petit conscrit)", "Jean-Louis Paris (Le cardinal B\u00e9gin)", "Jacques Godin (Le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Lessard)", "Luc-Martial Dagenais (L'aide de camp)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
