Matt Rutherford was an angry teen with learning disabilities; a petty criminal who lived on the streets. Sailing saved him from a life of crime, or worse. Matt became the first to sail alone, without stopping around both Americas. His beat up boat was as tiny as his budget, yet he raised $120,000 for disabled sailors while braving icebergs, the Arctic and Cape Horn. After 309 days at sea, he returned to a hero's welcome and 30 dollars in the bank. He founded a non-profit that does ocean research. Matt's story makes us feel we can do more than we imagined.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uwqzqO6WsXVAbCul6x8E3TNKj9s.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
