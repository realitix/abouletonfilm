The shortness of the film permits little other than just identification. The photographic composition is a tight one-shot (close-up), and just the head and shoulders of the subject are visible.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
