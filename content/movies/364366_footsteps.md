The film became expanded into positive and negative to change balances within it; black for perspective, then black to shadow the screen and make paradoxes with the idea of acting, and the act of seeing the screen.  The music sets a mood then turns a space, remembers the positive then silences the flatness of the negative.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8IabvdthJJvVUz3yShxbXZxoWjX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
