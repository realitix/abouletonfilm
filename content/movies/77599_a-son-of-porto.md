His father, writer Frans Lopulalan, understands his son\u2019s desire to touch Moluccan soil; he shares that wish. The two decide to travel to the village of Porto on Saparua island, where Frans\u2019 deceased father, a former KNIL soldier, used to live. Verhaagen follows them on their trip to the tropics. A trip that the two men experience in different ways. Frans writes a lot and visits the ground where his father\u2019s house once stood. Bendja dives into the daily village life. He also wonders if he shouldn\u2019t resume his ancestors\u2019 battle. Frans has mixed feelings about this: \u2018I hope he can identify with being Moluccan without it necessarily causing him to reject his life in Holland.\u2019 The personal experiences of father and son Lopulalan are complemented by significant archive footage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1HU4jn3iThtIgpYoBCClJHT27sJ.jpg", "actors": ["Frans Lopulalan (Himself)", "Bendje Lopulalan (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "z6ODKXhAC0k"}
