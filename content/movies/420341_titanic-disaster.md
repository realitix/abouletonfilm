We see the actual Titanic leaving for its last voyage and also all the aftermath of the tragedy. We get to view various interesting aspects including seeing Captain Smith minutes before the boat sails, the Mary Sculley and the Carpathia in action, the Carpathia returning to the shore with survivors, Captain Rostrum of the Carpathia, family members at the White Star Office in NY waiting for news and even some of the survivors pulled off the lifeboats. Anyone interested in this historic event would certainly find this film fascinating and it's pretty sad and spooky to watch it today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2c0dUpI8CSoQT5rsbsgNGjvVuFM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [193900, 148791, 194594, 231035], "youtube_key": "hmuz_mhYY-I"}
