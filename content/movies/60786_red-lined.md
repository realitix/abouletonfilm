His headstrong, unpredictable lover, Carli, has a penchant for magnums and fur. This is a pair that believes if you're not living on the edge, you're taking up too much space. Together they take on rival gang leader Jack Hand - and the local law enforcers, Blondine Dimaggio, a cop who has seen too much, and her partner Peter Dasha, whos police badge has an axe-like impact... in his own mind!
