Constructing a densely layered, nonlinear weave of the mythical and the everyday, Velez probes beneath the surface to unearth ancient, often anarchic tensions. In Velez's rich, transequential collage of imagery, emblems of contemporary Japan \u2014 the Bullet train, businessmen and McDonald's \u2014 collide with traditional ritual, from Kabuki and Sumo to Shinto. Defying documentary expectations of a narrative voice, Velez redefines the content through a carefully structured progression of visual and aural metaphors. The \"interval\" of the title relates to the Japanese concept of \"ma\" \u2014 the space between things, a source of energy, tension and balance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zjsEXn4db5QNAUmryCYAhOknfjM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
