The thirteen-minute film, which premiered in theatres only seven months after Star Wars, consisted of little more than inside jokes and visual puns that heavily depended upon audience familiarity with the original. The theme song is Richard Wagner's famous \"Ride of the Valkyries\". The tagline was \"You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss three bucks goodbye.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d60G9dcMyLTKUCYNoIwoPNtZOZ6.jpg", "actors": ["Frank Robertson (4-Q-2)", "Jeff Hale (Augie 'Ben' Doggie)", "Artie Deco ()", "Scott Matthews (Fluke Starbucker)", "Cindy Furgatch (Princess Anne-Droid)", "Bob Knickerbocker (Ham Salad)", "Ernie Fosselius ()", "Paul Frees (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [189595, 189057, 189824, 189059], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
