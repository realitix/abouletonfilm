Thousands of people are affected by suicide yearly. Once I Dreamt of Life is a feature length documentary film about suicide. It\u2019s an account about one\u2019s personal relation to suicide, but also studies suicide as social phenomena: The motives, warning signs &amp; consequences.  The film follows the journey of a young man, an animated character based on a real person, on his path towards suicide. The journey is described by people who\u2019ve had encounters with suicide \u2013 parents who lost their child, young adults who considered or even tried committing suicide.  When linked together, these experiences offer a collage of our perception of suicide. They tell about how people cope with the past and find a reason to go on with their lives. The intention is not to romanticize suicide or judge. It encourages people to talk about painful and difficult experiences and reminds us how important it is to be heard.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sz29VB9UlWQtG0AHaMEuzYrJozd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
