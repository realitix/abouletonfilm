It presents a seemingly desultory time period to tell the story of two generations. A young girl who\u2019s confused about what lies ahead is sent to England to receive education from childhood. She indulges herself in cyberlove and cannot get herself out of the hurtful affair. A middle-aged father who\u2019s perplexed about death left his hometown for Beijing when he was young. He feels helpless about the status quo of the state-owned film studio. Tortured by terminal disease, he gives up the hope to live on.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5D8GxYEvIUxoGwWHY9zJeDz8n2R.jpg", "actors": ["Men Tu ()", "Liya Ai ()", "Degena Yun ()", "Yingerile Ba ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
