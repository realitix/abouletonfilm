The depredations must have gotten more blatant because two constables, played by Pearl Cheung Ling and Tin Hok are both tasked with eliminating them. Pearl Cheung recruits Lam Gwong-Wing who is either the third constable of the title or an informant. Lam is a bit of a goof\u2014he would rather lounge in luxury with beautiful young women peeling grapes for him than go after the Devil Clan\u2014which seems to make a lot of sense\u2014but he reluctantly goes along with her after she threatens him. Lam is literally grabbed away from her by the constable played by Tin Hok for his war for his parallel operation. There is a third figure, neither a constable nor a Devil Clanner. He is Wolf Warrior who simply shows up and kills people\u2014lots of people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wpcVBJ4C1i8atiwqLfRYg5GJwgf.jpg", "actors": ["Chang Ling ()", "Tien Peng ()", "Tien Ho ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
