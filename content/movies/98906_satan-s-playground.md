En route to a wilderness camping retreat, their car inexplicably breaks down. As darkness falls, panic sets in. Then the marooned family stumbles upon an ancient and seemingly abandoned house. And it is here that they meet the bizarre Mrs. Leeds who lives there with her equally unhinged children. Offering no assistance, she warns of a violent, unseen force lurking in the forbidding countryside. Soon, the family will encounter a supernatural evil older than the woods themselves. SATAN'S PLAYGROUND...a place where deadly myth becomes gruesome reality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2j8sOzJUpmHuyUy1dfGWIdRi2DF.jpg", "actors": ["Felissa Rose (Donna Bruno)", "Ellen Sandweiss (Paula)", "Edwin Neal (Boy)", "Irma St. Paule (Mrs. Leeds)", "Danny Lopes (Sean)", "Christie Sanford (Judy)", "Ron Millkie (Officer Peters)", "Salvatore Paul Piro (Frank Bruno)", "Raine Brown (Prostitute)", "Robert Zappalorti (Cop)", "Marco Rose (Baby Anthony)", "Maureen Tomaselli (Reporter)", "Jessy Hodges (Lost Teen)", "Chris Farabaugh (Stoner)", "Michael Ryan (Whipping Boy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [133535, 384216, 257976, 95056], "youtube_key": "_1TtgiyIXv8"}
