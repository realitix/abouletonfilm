After being diagnosed by his proctologist with just days to live, Waldo seeks the help of the mysterious Japanese specialist, Dr. Wansamsaki, who treats Waldo with his unorthodox methods, which involve a long nuclear rod. The next day, Waldo\u2019s rear end starts glowing a bright green \u2013 and that\u2019s only the beginning. Within days, Waldo\u2019s rear end develops a mind of its own, becoming capable of breaking away in the middle of the night, committing a mur\u00adder or two and then returning before morning, leaving a fecal trail that leads right to Waldo\u2019s bedroom.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wJXyiH1Qo46vNjCBF8jNdceanWK.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Devlin (Waldo Williams)", "Bill Devlin (Valveeta Williams)", "Jean Black (Detective Cipolla)", "Jim Rainey (Detective Cosacca)", "Michael Raye (Summa Cum Lauden)", "Tyrone Dubose (Johnny Pecks)", "Michael R.
