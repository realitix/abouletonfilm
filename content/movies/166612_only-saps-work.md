Based on a play by Owen Davis Sr., the film  casts Errol as James Wilson, a kleptomaniac who starts with picking  pockets and ends up robbing a bank. Wilson's friend Lawrence Payne  (Richard Arlen) inadvertently aids our hero during one of his heists,  ending up in deep doo-doo with the law. Before Wilson is able to  extricate Payne from his dilemma for the sake of heroine Barbara Tanner  (Mary Brian), he pauses long enough to pose as a private eye -- and even  gives bellboy Oscar (Stu Erwin) tips on how to spot a crook! If only all of  Leon Errol's feature films had been as consistently hilarious as Only Saps  Work.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Leon Errol (James Wilson)", "Richard Arlen (Lawrence Payne)", "Mary Brian (Barbara Tanner)", "Stuart Erwin (Oscar)", "Charley Grapewin (Simeon Tanner)", "Anderson Lawler (Horace Baldwin)", "Fred Kelsey (Murphy)", "Nora Cecil (Mrs. Partridge)", "George Irving (Dr. White)", "George Chandler (Elevator Operator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
