From the bluesy, atonal  music and haunting lyrics, to the artist\u2019s steadfast seclusion and sheer longevity, everything about this man intrigues. Twenty-five years, 34 albums, and not a single live show or public appearance. Even the simple detail of the man's real name is a mystery. Jandek on Corwood is the 89-minute documentary that explores this man, his world and his music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iPsJCXEoIRv6fVfpbdhYaCdU3xj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "zR3cwr1aE7g"}
