He's not really sad about this because he prefers writing songs and playing the guitar. He meets the drummer Charlie and they decide to start a band, although Tony is afraid of playing in front of other people. He can't even play in front of Charlie. They find another guitarist, Wynn, who enjoys fishing if he's not playing the guitar. The final member of the band is Eric, the bass-player who is often unpredictable in his actions. They name the band Circus Monkey and want to get famous and rich. However, after some successful gigs, they begin to realize what all the big music and show business is about", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fcN6duExs3AjgH3JDJTSKTXfQPu.jpg", "actors": ["Kevin Corrigan (Wynn Knapp)", "Steve Parlavecchio (Eric Ellwood)", "Lee Holmes (Tony Ridge)", "Matthew Hennessey (Charlie Flagg)", "Doug MacMillan (Linus Tate)", "Steph Robinson (Dizz)", "Mary Ellen Williams (Helen)", "Jeffrey Pillars (Trumholdt)", "Lisa Keller (Ann Halen)", "Doug McCallie (Chester Mealy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "bh2E4djUXEo"}
