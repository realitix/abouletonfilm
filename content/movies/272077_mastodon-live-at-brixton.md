Captured at a February 2012 gig in London, Brixton finds the Georgia prog-sludge mainstays barreling through 23 choice cuts from their five good-to-classic LPs, 2002's Remission through 2011's The Hunter, a typically remarkable performance from a band whose live prowess rivals their in-studio wizardry. Like most overviews, the song selection's arguable, the impact of even the highest highs altered in their uprooting. But Brixton does the same rep-cementing, catalog-calcifying work a good hits comp is supposed to, further solidifying Mastodon's spot among the greatest big-ticket metal bands going.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iadEhXCGEl7qhvgSW4O5BC82OxN.jpg", "actors": ["Mastodon (Band)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
