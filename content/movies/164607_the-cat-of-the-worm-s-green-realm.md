A moon lifts out of this dark weave to be replaced by autumn leaves against a grainy sky, a fiery sky. A gray cat licks itself. A black cat sits quickly down on a green lawn.  A \"night\" of showering dark, a \"dawn\" of pinks and yellows of plant growth in close-up. A gentle yellow \"high noon\" prevails into which the orange worm appears and reappears, twisting, arching, turning. A phosphorescent orange of leaves explodes midst greens and black holes appropriate to the image of the worm. The forms of many varieties of leafage mix with a veritable rain or clash of overall tones, a fire of forms, a glowing color photo-negative of worm, and the final canopies of autumn tone and sky tone permeated by sun, sun streaks and octagonal prism shapes ad infinitum.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2S6Vcfb84LFYTQV4kRW7deuAU9Y.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [383841, 285768, 262854, 152973], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
