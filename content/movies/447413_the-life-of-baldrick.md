Baldrick took over his father's accounting firm, 'Perry and Associates', after he passed away , and since then, he has managed to quickly turn the company around, for the worse. Due to his unethical ways, people are starting to leave the firm, and therefore he must interview some potentially new employees. 'Baldrick' is an overweight middle aged man, with a receding hairline, that thinks he is a lot funnier and more popular than he actually is, but overtime, we see that Baldrick may not be as confident as he portrays himself to be - Like every bully, he takes out his own frustrations, hurt, anger and lack of attention, out on others to make himself feel popular, 'cool' and in charge.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
