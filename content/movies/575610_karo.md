In this piece, we explore her creative collaboration with Canadian National Ballet dancer/choreographer Brent Parolin and Tanya Howard, as well as make-up artist Ashley Readings.  We wanted to encapsulate the essence rather than the information. There are many pieces where Karolina is featured as a photographer discussing her work, but we wanted to get underneath the surface, into the intangible matters that drive and inspire her to create and collaborate so intimately.  This project was captured on 35mm film, with a small crew in Karolina\u2019s home studio.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cKAQ8Teen7di6Ao2htmpFglBHVg.jpg", "actors": ["Karolina Kuras (Herself)", "Brent Parolin (Dancer)", "Tanya Howard (Dancer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
