The list was compiled by Hawass with the assistance of some of the world's leading Egyptologists. Each discovery has a theme centered around a part of everyday life in Ancient Egypt. For six of those discoveries, a certain emphasis is placed on how some of their themes have managed to influence modern life. The documentary concludes with a short segment on how the practice of mummification influenced modern surgery with both procedures sharing much of the same techniques.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rn7tYVvpYg6gnIRAOSQrRhzdfWK.jpg", "actors": ["Zahi Hawass (Main actor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "b5f40QR7vcU"}
