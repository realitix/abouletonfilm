Voices that fight for his attention and demand his subordination. On his daily, semi-hypnotic journeys through his alienating, colorless city, he searches for companionship and happiness. He thinks he finds it when he meets the girl he loves - but to whom he never speaks. This surreal, magical and philosophically charged tale examines the life of an outcast as he struggles to blend into a world where everyone searches for their own uniqueness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mszBtOv5sE2nlxQdRJ5t0tD30hF.jpg", "actors": ["Devin Harjes (Nathan)", "Nicole Sudhaus (Naomi)", "Kathy Deitch (Angela)", "Dora Sacer (Katie)", "Omer Barnea (The Photographer)", "Kara Addington (Ashleigh)", "Afton Jillian (The Singer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "UcxYAU4uAZQ"}
