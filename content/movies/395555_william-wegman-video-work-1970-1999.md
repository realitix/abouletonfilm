These early pioneering tapes were created using minimal technology and a few studio props, including Wegman\u2019s canine companion, Man Ray.  Consisting of 130 works, some no longer than a television commercial, blurred the boundaries between high and low art as well as art and commerce, and have become a major chapter in the histories of contemporary art and film.  This exhaustive compilation has been assembled by the artist with restored material and it contains all nine original reels as well as two later reels.  Classics such as  Pocketbook Man, Milk/Floor, Stomach Song, Cape On, Stick and Tooth, Spelling Lesson,  Dog Duet, Man Ray, Do You Want to?
