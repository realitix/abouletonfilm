Barry plays Jim Randall, a lawman assigned to investigate a series of gold shipment robberies. Arriving in the middle of a hold-up, Randall finds himself accused of killing the driver (Yakima Canutt). Wells Fargo agent Cal Chambers (Milton Kibbee) vouches for his innocence, however, claiming him to be a noted geologist. Along with several of the prospectors, Jim devises a plan to prove that Jud Parker (Harry Worth) is using his dummy mine as a cover for stealing ore.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5sCXF6jaw4Gu1qgbvKYowdjSJ9Z.jpg", "actors": ["Don Barry (Jim Randall)", "Lynn Merrick (Martha King)", "William Haade (Sheriff Ed King)", "Milton Kibbee (Cal Chambers (as Milt Kibbee))", "Harry Worth (Jud Parker)", "Dorothy Sebastian (Helen King)", "Jack Kirk (Henchman Turner)", "Forrest Taylor (Ben Brown)", "Charles R.
