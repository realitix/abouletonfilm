Shot in spare studio settings over the course of a year, the individual interviews place a sweeping cross-section of industry notables -including Ozzy Osbourne, Fiona Apple, Lenny Kravitz, Karen O, Yim Yames, Danny Elfman, Philip Glass, Ben Gibbard, and Herbie Hancock - in dialogue with one another as they attempt to explain the nuances of their field, the ambitions that drive them, the inspiration they draw from their chosen work, and the ineffable universality of the language of music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iCYnHKi7Q73g0J95iP8YrsDNY7I.jpg", "actors": ["Trey Anastasio ()", "Laurie Anderson ()", "Fiona Apple ()", "Dave Brubeck ()", "Common ()", "Philip Glass ()", "Herbie Hancock ()", "Jim James ()", "John Legend ()", "Ziggy Marley ()", "Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor ()", "Yoko Ono ()", "Iggy Pop ()", "John Williams ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
