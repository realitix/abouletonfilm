The prize: $25,000. After both contenders make holes in one, a psychological battle begins. Woody crunches celery. Dapper drives himself into a sand trap. Woody proves himself too light for quicksand; Dapper sinks. At every turn, Dapper proceeds to lure and trick poor Woody until Woody's game seems lost. All that Dapper needs to win is a short putt into the cup, but he's seized with a magnificent case of hiccups. Woody wins and hiccups dollar bills!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wQ2WHAipibZd2L4vWzOAkUBm5cF.jpg", "actors": ["Grace Stafford (Woody Woodpecker (voice))", "Dal McKennon ((voices))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
