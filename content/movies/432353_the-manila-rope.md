Manillak\u00f6ysi has an endless list of classic one-liners, but it is still not based on cheap laughs or anything like that. The whole humouristic aspect of it comes from describing the absurdity of war, and the whole military system, by looking it with the eyes of a simple man, who's thrown into it, and who simply does not give a rats ass of it all.  The tone of it is not overly preachy or moralizing. If I would have to describe it with one word, it would be: unglamourizing. The main point of Manillak\u00f6ysi is pretty much compressed in one of the most famous quotes of it: There is nothing supernatural about war, it is just work like anything else.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iG4Ec91Pkgx9FDGyvDWvCXXO39X.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
