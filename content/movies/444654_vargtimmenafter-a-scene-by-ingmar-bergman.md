Frame for frame, Georg Tiller and his cameraman Claudio Pfeifer reproduced the same shots\u2014with the crucial difference that no actors are visible. All we see are the ocean and cliffs in black and white, steep rock formations, and with them the quiet surface of the water, ruffled slightly by the breeze. The soundtrack, which had no dialogue in the original either, was taken from the first film and adds narrative structure to the lonely landscape. While in Vargtimmen Bergman concentrated on the faces of people, the focus of Tiller\u2019s film experiment is space, and nature.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
