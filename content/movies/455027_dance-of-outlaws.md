Moroccan Hind was raped and consequently denied an official identity \u2013 she has no other choice but to work as a prostitute and traditional wedding dancer, but despite the odds of her situation, refuses to give up her dream of dignity, motherhood and love.  This is a story of modern day outlaws, children of prostitutes, abandoned child brides and those who have had to escape to the fringes of patriarchal Moroccan society. Through the eyes of one young woman we see a life of constant struggle, but also a life free of the society\u2019s norms and boundaries. The woman in the centre of the film, Hind, is both vulnerable and courageous as she tries to regain her life, her children and her mere right to live as an equal human being in the 21st century.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yElRJfyCHbXGGIVCIgbHJ4gF6PH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
