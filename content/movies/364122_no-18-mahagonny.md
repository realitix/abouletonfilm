Smith worked on this cinematic transformation of Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht\u2019s opera Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny (1929) for over ten years and considered it his magnum opus. The film was shot from 1970 to 1972 and edited for the next eight years.  The \u201cprogram\u201d of the film is meticulous, with a complex structure and order. The Weill opera is transformed into a numerological and symbolic system. Images in the film are divided into categories\u2014 portraits, animation, symbols and nature\u2014 to form the palindrome P.A.S.A.N.A.S.A.P. The film contains invaluable cameos of important avant-garde figures such as Allen Ginsberg, Patti Smith, and Jonas Mekas, intercut with installation pieces from Robert Mapplethorpe\u2019s studio, New York City landmarks of the era, and Smith\u2019s visionary animation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lHD7r615KXSvZ2QxSlxL2yfntrd.jpg", "actors": ["Patti Smith ()", "Allen Ginsberg ()", "Lotte Lenya (voice)", "Jonas Mekas ()", "Robert Mapplethorpe ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
