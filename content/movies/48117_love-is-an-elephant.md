In a triptych of three different stories, told by three inmates of a jail, the story unfolds with sarcasm and irony regarding human actions. The heroes of the film try to tame human passions (erotically instinctive) - but, alas, they do not succeed. A situation comedy in which the nude appears in the plot where least expected.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s3u0CsaY04ZkXJX9cH6pEqQ4DbT.jpg", "actors": ["Thodoris Atheridis (Grigoris)", "Eva Vlahakou (Stella)", "Dimitra Matsouka (Maggie)", "Alexandra Palaiologou (Mara Karydi)", "Takis Papamattheou (Spyros)", "Anna-Maria Papaharalambous (Hristina)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "xaqYk_F0Ca0"}
