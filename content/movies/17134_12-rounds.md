Oh yes I did).\r\n\r\nAnd Ashley Scott is definitely no Sandra Bullock and furthermore Aidan Gillen no Dennis Hopper.\r\n\r\nThat said, it's not terrible, SPEED (1994) to me is just one of the best blockbuster action movies of the 90's so the chance that it would match up to it would really be second to none.\r\n\r\nAnyway back to this movie, it's okay fairly mindless popcorn entertainment, Renny Harlin is good when it comes to action-sequences and yet again he delivers on those aspects.\r\n\r\nI'm usually not bothered to much over shaky cams but this movie contains a overabundance of that and occasionally you wish they would just use steady cam but what can you do? not much.\r\n\r\nThere's really not that much more to talk about the movie, it's not a bad movie we've just seen it before.\r\n\r\nIt's the best movie I've seen with John Cena at least, there is always that."}], "recommandations_id": [195269, 8975, 46713, 4597], "youtube_key": "3-F6GUQo5HQ"}
