The following stories in the show may or may not shed light on the inscription. Questions remain unanswered. The Residents study death, not as a horrific end, but as the ultimate question that we all ask while wondering if any of it is even real.\r Recorded April 16, 2011 at Bimbo's in San Francisco", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qsFwC6ztSOrmNFRWpXSMzmd7y4M.jpg", "actors": ["Randy Rose (Singer)", "Charles Bobuck (Keyboarder)", "Nolan Cook (Guitarist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
