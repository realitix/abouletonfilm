She tries to establish a rhythm through every day routines such as eating,  sleeping and washing. We see one of here childhood memories-an Alsatian dog  licks a girl\u2019s heel and rests its head between her legs- and a dream, in which she  is standing naked I a pit which could be a grave. In addition we see a magnified  symbolic version of her surroundings, particularly of insects. Shots of windows,  doors and mirrors convey a sense of menace and introspection. Thanks to measured performance by Marion van Wijk, superb lighting, black and white photography and well balanced editing. The Ants is a highly compelling and evocative film.\" (A.de Ronde)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AhEUaNmv9PQFFO5t420oDODLpeV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
