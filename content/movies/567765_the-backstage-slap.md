The actors and actresses have to support themselves with odd jobs ranging from selling food and drinks on the streets to dancing at bars to doing commercials. Then comes a great play, written and directed by Teacher Nguyen Dinh, a veteran playwright, and former troupe mentor. The play promises to bring the group everything they need: inspiring work, state funding, festival prizes, and fame. But the rising tension between lead actress Kim Ha and her womanizing co-star Van Hung due to their troubled past relationship threatens to tear the play apart.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zRvgzOzj70t517ZcLz2E7OoHKW2.jpg", "actors": ["Nguyen Lan Huong (Kim Ha)", "Manh Cuong Tran (Van Hung)", "Nhu Trang (Xoan)", "Ngoc Thuy (Nguyen Dinh)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "YcTw95b2KTQ"}
