It is a tale of passion and fear, set against a backdrop of revolution and violence. The film is what most people remember, but the story of the writing of the book has more twists, intrigue and bravery than many a Hollywood blockbuster. In this documentary, Stephen Smith traces the revolutionary beginnings of this bestseller, to it becoming a pawn of the CIA at the height of the Cold War.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a2je2WiwSk1Ryj4Fd3itFlMKrfA.jpg", "actors": ["Stephen Smith (Presenter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
