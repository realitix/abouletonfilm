Berenice convinces her younger brother Brian that she is the reincarnation of a witch with the powers to put everything right. As they grow up Brian becomes emotionally dependent on his sister, so that when she returns to the family home for Christmas with her new boyfriend he feels totally betrayed. At the same time a man strongly resembling the mythical Jake the Mid-Folker is closing in. An overwhelming sense of impending horror surrounds the house, but is the enemy outside - or is the enemy within?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hucjXdWQplyxJCpR3RWmLQi8BV1.jpg", "actors": ["Elliott Jordan (Brian Usher)", "Claudine Spiteri (Berenice Usher)", "Christopher Terry (Rod Usher)", "Sara Bispham (Young Berenice)", "Alex Vandepeer (Young Brian)", "Craig Henderson (Conrad)", "Suzanne Bertish (Madeline Usher)", "Heather Chasen (Eleanora Usher)", "Les Dungar (Uncle Reg)", "Peter Ellis (The Vicar)", "Dom Gallagher (Ambulancemen)", "William Lockhart (The Clown)", "Simon Mason (Sgt.
