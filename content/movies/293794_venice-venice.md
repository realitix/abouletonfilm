A beautiful French journalist arrives at the festival with the apparent intention of interviewing the unique and eccentric filmmaker. In the midst of all the festival madness, she is forced to confront the wide divergence between things as they really are and things as they seem to be - both on screen and off.

Shot half in Venice, Italy and half in Venice, California, \"Venice/Venice\" looks at the profound effect movies have had - and continue to have - on our lives, our loves and on our dreams of romance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nqlBOmZRF1KKIHiP8EeZZbAJAZ3.jpg", "actors": ["Henry Jaglom (Dean)", "Nelly Alard (Jeanne)", "Melissa Leo (Peggy)", "Suzanne Bertish (Carlotta)", "Daphna Kastner (Eve)", "David Duchovny (Dylan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
