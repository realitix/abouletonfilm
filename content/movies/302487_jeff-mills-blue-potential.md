The concert consists of fifteen orchestral reworkings of Mills\u2019 tracks ranging from classics such as \u2018Amazon\u2019 and \u2018Sonic Destroyer\u2019 to more recent material from his soundtracks to \u2018Metropolis\u2019 and \u2018Three Ages\u2019. The arrangement is simple: Mills provides the rhythmic backbone with his trademark 909 percussive hiss and snare while the orchestra provides the melodic and harmonic elements.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yuyZB8qrNQG9AAa6mLTYorwVzVo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
