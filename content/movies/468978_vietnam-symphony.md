With the help of villagers they built an entire campus underground where they lived, studied and played music for five years as the war raged around them. This documentary records the coming together of the former conservatory students and villagers for a reunion concert 30 years after the war, to paint a moving portrait of life in Vietnam then and now.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wa6Nza8yvnU5e63orjx8WFRXMag.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
