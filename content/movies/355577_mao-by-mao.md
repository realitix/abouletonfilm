The rise to power of the film's namesake appears as the inevitable outcome of a dialectical logical. Or so the voice-over might lead one to believe. If the usual practice of d\u00e9tourned films is for the soundtrack to undermine the image, here the reverse occasionally takes place. The images critique Mao's words. They show that which, even in the official visual record of the times, the narrative elides.  The film is dedicated to Li Yhi Zhe, the nominal author of a famous Democracy Wall critique of the Maoist state.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oSlQelQ4MojGWptWSRFk6C0Tp2u.jpg", "actors": ["Mao Zedong (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
