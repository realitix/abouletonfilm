He began the foundation after observing and living with the deep poverty of the Southern blues artists he befriended and championed.The foundation now helps hundreds of older Southern musicians with everything from financial assistance to tour support. The film travels back to the early artists that were the inspiration for Music Maker, and forward to the current artists carrying on the Southern roots tradition. The film features performances, archival and contemporary, of Music Maker artists on tour and in the studio, as well as interviews with the artists and Duffy on the foundation, music and the blues.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gOPNMFbkCgTNTbcxXitYhW3vQI3.jpg", "actors": ["Timothy Duffy (Himself)", "Adolphus Bell (Himself)", "Denise Duffy (Herself)", "Essie Mae Brooks (Herself)", "Willa Mae Buckner (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "BbWwO2XrU4c"}
