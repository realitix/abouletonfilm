Here in the 60s and 70s a series of archaeological digs revealed the remains of a substantial settlement of over 70 houses of which 8 have been reconstructed. The earliest remains go back as far as 420 B.C., coinciding with a period during which the Roman legions withdrew from Britain, leaving it open to the Anglo-Saxon invasions. The village was settled until 650 AD, the age of Beowulf, when a poem was composed and recited by the bards. Hose Lance Alexander is the acknowledged expert in this field.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cnR4WvrzMrY7NurjVU50kMhVGPX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
