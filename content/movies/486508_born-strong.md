Each year, the Arnold Strongman Classic crowns the winner in the purest test of strength on the planet. This year\u2019s Arnolds are unique with each of these four weighing more than 400 pounds. Lithuanian Zydrunas Savickas, 40, is the acknowledged Strongest Man Ever, who may have passed his prime. American Brian Shaw is the defending champion, a 6\u20198\u2019, 425-pound giant who seems poised to take the crown. England\u2019s Eddie Hall is \u201cthe hungry wolf, \u201d knocking on the door. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything, \u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll die, if I have to. \u201d Finally, there\u2019s Icelander Hafthor Bjornsson, who plays the Mountain on Game of Thrones. He\u2019s the youngest of the group, but with perhaps the greatest potential. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see these Monsters, \u201d says Arnold Schwarzenegger, the host of the competition and a former bodybuilding champion. Born Strong revels in the drama when these remarkable giants clash.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fot5hiDybdAk5z6YeMzPw1kXSjI.jpg", "actors": ["Arnold Schwarzenegger (himself)", "Haf\u00fe\u00f3r J\u00fal\u00edus Bj\u00f6rnsson (himself)", "Mark Henry (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [532944, 207021], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
