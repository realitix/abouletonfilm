So, instead he goes on an outing in his new car with his friends. The captioning says it's a new '101 horsepower car'--this, during an age when the horsepower of cars actually was between 4-30 horsepower! So, in other words, it's supposed to be a super-fast car.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wak59gCv26akxtNVaZlRPd7ZA5t.jpg", "actors": ["Lucien Bataille (Zigoto)", "Gaston Modot ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
