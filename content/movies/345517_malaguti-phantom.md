With a slightly mutilated face, minimal social skills and a clapped-out moped that he can\u2019t show off either, he is not getting anywhere. Nevertheless, his goal is clear. He is very keen to join the group of tough boys and girls in his unassuming rural village. Step by step, he adapts to their codes. This does not immediately bring him success.
