Today we are now living in that future age of robots and artificial intelligence and all those dreams of the past are coming true. Mechanical robots will soon be outdated with biologically created humanoids connected to each other across the globe. They will self-repair, gather energy from the sun and live forever. They will be all-knowing and all-powerful like Gods that will walk the Earth. This future world is now inevitable and cannot be stopped. The greatest brains on Earth today have warned us about the consequences of getting this new technology wrong. They have predicted catastrophe. Prepare to meet your future.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zsYcjyDE92oRMPl3dbU5vVYRNJK.jpg", "actors": ["Dickson Grey ()", "Razor Keeves ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
