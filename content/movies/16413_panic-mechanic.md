It\u00b4s not long before Schucks discovers his new boss, Jack Paddaman, is as crooked as they come, but it\u00b4s too late: the employment contract is signed and sealed.A year passes, and Schucks is no better off. However, his candid camera videos, which poke fun at all sectors of post-1994 South Africa, prove a big hit with stressed-out government ministers. When the president asks Paddaman to make a movie to benefit street children, Schucks and his pals do all the hard work while Paddaman plans how he can get hold of the profits from the video sales. Add a scatterbrained secretary, a lovelorn traffic cop and a cunning street child and you have a roll-in-the aisles comedy with a distinctly South African flavour.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3ImRIZOFKeamXuV4MfOTkKQAyqE.jpg", "actors": ["Leon Schuster (Schuks)", "Tolla Van Der Merwe (Jakob)", "Frantz Dobrowsky (Jack Paddaman)", "Nana Stapelberg (Gloria Haasbroek)", "Themba Ndaba (Billy)", "Taryn Sudding (Annie / Various characters)", "John Robbie (Himself)", "Dorette Nel (Saartjie)", "Sello Sebotsane (Hijacker)", "Desmond Dube (SABC man)", "Lieb Bester (Gys)", "Ernest Ndhlovu (SABC boss)", "Pierre van Pletzen (Coetzee)", "Tim Plewman (Minister of Transport)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
