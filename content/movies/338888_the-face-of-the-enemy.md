We hear South and North Vietnamese, including \u00e9migr\u00e9s to the United States, describing how huge numbers of friends met their deaths, caught as they were between government forces, the Vietcong, and the Americans; how political boundaries divided not only the country, but also families; how mothers deserted their children because their fathers were American soldiers; and how the war cruelly lingers on long after hostilities ceased, in the lives of children born crippled by chemical weapons.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xKVIph6Uw6eZdhZNU9TLlx8dNhb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
