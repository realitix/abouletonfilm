State Of Mind examines the science of control that has evolved over generations to keep us firmly in place so that dictators, power brokers and corporate puppeteers may profit from our ignorance and slavery. From the anvil of compulsory schooling to media and entertainment, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.  State Of Mind delves into the abyss to expose the true agendas at work. This film reveals the secret manipulations at work and provides shocking and suppressed historical and current examples.  From the ancient roots of the control of human behavior to its maturity in the mind control experiments of intelligence agencies and other organs of manipulation, State Of Mind reveals a plan for the future that drives home the dreadful price of our ignorance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ml55PGm8eKxxAHejmV1bgQ430MJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
