The best accounts agree that he emerged on Earth as Herman Blount, born in Birmingham, Alabama in 1914, although Sun Ra himself always denied that Blount was his surname. He returned to Saturn in 1993 after creating a stunningly variegated and beautiful assemblage of earthly and interplanetary music, most notably with his fervently loyal Arkestra.  Sun Ra and his Arkestra were the subject of a few documentary films, notably Robert Mugge\u2019s \u2018A Joyful Noise\u2019 (1980), which interspersed performances and rehearsals with Sun Ra\u2019s commentary on various subjects ranging from today\u2019s youth to his own place in the cosmos. This documentary reuses some of Mugge\u2019s material and includes some additional interviews.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z98uz8kbFYpNppXQavpWJCaZuBI.jpg", "actors": ["Sun Ra (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
