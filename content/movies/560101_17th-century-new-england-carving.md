Geometric, floral and architectural elements combine to make up the designs. First-hand examinations of oak furniture in both public and private collections provide the material upon which my work is based, which I do in the traditional manner from riving oak logs and working the green wood with hand tools.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kiOHmc0Rlxf4NyxGFuONdqeYYIK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
