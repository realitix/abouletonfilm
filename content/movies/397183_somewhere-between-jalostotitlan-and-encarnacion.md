In this film, the incident is revealed through a poetic text, derived from my written journals. The poetry mixes primarily with Mexican streetscapes which compliment the text in a tonal sense. Most images are twenty-eight seconds long, the \u2018breath\u2019 of the 16mm Bolex camera. A lone saxophone (Mike Callich) weaves its way through the narrative, blending to make stronger the tomes and accentuations of the images.\u201d (PH)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i7JmTeTLqXkEwsGZpVZKzmsUgTA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
