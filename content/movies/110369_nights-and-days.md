The film is a rather straightforward and faithful adaptation of a novel by Maria Dabrowska with the same title. The plot is woven around the changing fortunes of a noble (upper-class) Niechcic family in the pre-WWI Poland. There are two main crossing threads: a social history one and an existential one. The cinematographic version is a condensation of the 12 part award winning TV serial of the same title and using the same cast and producers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1FZztybtKbxLOwZlpQHriFrHhyC.jpg", "actors": ["Jadwiga Baranska ()", "Jerzy Bi\u0144czycki ()", "Ewa Dalkowska (Olesia Chrobot\u00f3wna)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
