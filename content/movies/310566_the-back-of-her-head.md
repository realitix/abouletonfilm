The dioramic setup plays like a vertical REAR WINDOW: a shy daydreamer (played by Safdie) lives above an older Hindi man who lives above a reckless Brit who lives above a girl stuck in a bad relationship. The boy two floors up can only see the back of the girl\u2019s head but that\u2019s enough for a crush to develop. Safdie makes the most out of the single location, deploying dynamic camera angles, wry slapstick and even a couple of crane shots for a whimsical picture of city living.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ebUYPDRwc64uxLeeLjKXwTSWud6.jpg", "actors": ["Josh Safdie (Him)", "Charlotte Pinson (Her / Charlotte)", "Jagdeep Singh (Jagdeep)", "Jake Sumner (Jake)", "Stephen Schneider (Stephen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
