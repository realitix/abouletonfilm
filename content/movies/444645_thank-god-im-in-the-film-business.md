She knows the film business inside out \u2013 regardless of whether she\u2019s work- ing behind the camera as an assistant director or in front of it as an actor. Her name is closely associated with a series of now-legendary adaptations of Edgar Wallace\u2019s crime novels which were made in Germany during the 1960s. Upcoming young directors from local film schools have also profited from Ms. Ebner\u2019s unbroken enthusiasm and passion for film.  However, this eighty-year-old has a more than broken relationship to the events of her childhood and youth in Gdansk \u2013 a time when her life was characterised by an anti-Semitic step-mother and the dangers posed by the Nazi regime. This film portrait does not eschew any of the long dark shadows of that era, nor does it sidestep any friction between portrayer and his subject.
