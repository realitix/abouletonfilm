It took two days to read the charges against the 100 alleged war criminals in the docket (only 28 top officials are actually in the courtroom, which was limited in space), and the final judgment took one week to read.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tcvZ95IZFGvx8GwLvVsxRsf6LQC.jpg", "actors": ["Kei Sat\u014d (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
