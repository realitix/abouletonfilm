Its story centers on a magnificent masked ball, given by a Russian prince, that brings together all the main characters in various disguises. The three-act journey from boudoir to ballroom to jail provides ample opportunities for farce and humor, but also for genuine human emotion and a surprisingly realistic view of urban life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uqBbu57fVthod4UceTPyiij7shS.jpg", "actors": ["P\u00e4r Lindskog (Alfred)", "Lyubov Petrova (Adele)", "Pamela Armstrong (Rosalinde)", "Thomas Allen (Gabriel von Eisenstein)", "Ragnar Ulfung (Dr Blind)", "H\u00e5kan Hageg\u00e5rd (Dr Falke)", "Arthur Korn (Frank)", "Malena Ernman (Prince Orlofsky)", "Udo Samel (Frosch)", "Ren\u00e9e Sch\u00fcttengruber (Ida)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
