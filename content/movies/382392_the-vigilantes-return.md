But he is recognized by Kitty, co-owner with Clay Curtwright  of the infamous Bull Whip saloon. But \"bad-girl\" Kitty keeps her mouth shut. When Johnnie's pal Andy  reports a stage holdup, Curtwright's henchman, Ben Borden, talks the sheriff and Judge Holden into suspecting Johnnie. Johnnie reveals himself to Judge Holden as a government marshal, and the judge voices his opinion that Curtwright is the leader of the road agents, but voices it in the presence of his granddaughter, Louise Holden. The Judge doesn't know that Louise is in love with Curtwright, and she tips him off as to Johnnie's real identity. Curtwright frames Johnnie for a murder and arranges for the crooked sheriff to promote a lynching and Andy and Kitty help Johnnie escape jail. Johnnie rounds up vigilantes and heads for a showdown at the Bull Whip saloon", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8acX2LIv30WWGDWJ1qWg8VdBT4Q.jpg", "actors": ["Jon Hall (Marshal Johnnie Taggart)", "Margaret Lindsay (Kitty)", "Andy Devine (Andy)", "Paula Drew (Louise Holden)", "Jack Lambert (Ben Borden)", "Jonathan Hale (Judge Holden)", "Robert Wilcox (Clay Curtwright)", "Arthur Hohl (Sheriff)", "Joan Shawlee (Ben's Girl (as Joan Fulton))", "Lane Chandler (Messenger)", "Wallace Scott (Bartender)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
