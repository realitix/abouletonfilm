Asam and Garam dislike Pak Adam because both parties are in the construction business. Moreover, Pak Adam is an honest contractor unlike Asam and Garam. The news of a tender for the extension of the school in the village adds tension between Pak Adam and Asam and Garam, which forces Asam and Garam to try any means possible to sabotage Pak Adam's bid for the project.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/RPWMs3vXT9MiPkU9Ce6sQxAsWV.jpg", "actors": ["Mazlan Pet pet (Garam)", "Zaibo (Asam)", "Julia Hana (Cik Hawa)", "Azlee Senario (Pak Adam)", "Fimie Don (Amin)", "Nadia Mustafar (Odah)", "Syanie (Cik Dewi)", "Angeline Tan (Nyonya Wee)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "uTD-hmwMQ4A"}
