Although 40% of the province's population spoke French, they had been unable to make their voices heard. The movement started with students-sit-ins, demonstrations against Parliament, run-ins with the police - and soon spread to a majority of Acadians. The film captures the behind-the-scenes action and the students' determination to bring about change. An invaluable document of the rebirth of a people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ixd6fu6rhXg3pZBiD9ocbnXETUK.jpg", "actors": ["Michel Blanchard (Himself)", "R\u00e9gis Brown (Himself)", "Jean Cormier (Himself)", "Ir\u00e8ne Doiron (Herself)", "Bernard Gauvin (Himself)", "Blondine Maurice (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
