Pentrex takes you across the entire sub in the late 1990s, filming throughout the seasons to bring you a unique perspective on this important, busy line.  Starting at the Grand Crossing diamond in La Crosse, where BNSF crosses Canadian Pacific trackage, we follow intermodal, coal, grain, taconite, manifest, and other trains along the shores of the Mississippi. Bald Eagles are seen circling overhead, boats ply the waters, and train whistles echo off the surrounding bluffs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ofxvweCSt4BgBCrMUmk4vdDCXmZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
