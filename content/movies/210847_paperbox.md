Catastrophic flooding deprived thousands of people of all their possessions and roofs over their heads. A few weeks later Zbigniew Czapla found a box of old photographs in  his family house also ravaged by the element. The unique family mementoes left were destroyed by water, mud and mold. This film is a desperate attempt to keep memories, reconstruct people and events of the past. An impression on the transitory nature of memory, inevitability of fading and the destructive force of elements.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ePVUqSwKLRWV8YUXUHQz6BBa6Lw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
