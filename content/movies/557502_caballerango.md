Caballerango shows the boy\u2019s family members and townspeople as they reckon with the new realities borne out of this inexplicable tragedy. Each account of Nando\u2019s story reveals a different aspect of this rural town, which is deeply affected by modernization. The confrontation between the centuries-old ways of life and the modern-day world seems to be creating serious identity crises among the younger generation.  The story is told in a patient, observational style with methodical shots of the landscape, ranches, and of the two white horses, whom Nando and his father tended to. Those horses, the last to see Nando alive, connect us to an ethereal sensation of almost otherworldly mystical beings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1LMhO6B7z8jxFDQRWBWKym2MAUA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
