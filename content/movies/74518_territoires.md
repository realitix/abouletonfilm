Pretty much in the same league as what I imagine Fabio acting would be like.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah everything just goes straight to the drain from when he makes his entrance in the film and it leaves us with a very abrupt ending as well.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, first half 6/10, second half 3/10 at best.\r\n\r\nNo likes"}], "recommandations_id": [14866, 44950, 127722, 97794]}
