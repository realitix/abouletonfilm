Broodthaers had initially intended to project the film onto a screen printed with his poem inspired by La Fontaine, but he ultimately designed two screens of different sizes. One of the screens had his poem on it, and the other \u2013 in a black frame that brings to mind the television sets of the time \u2013, contained excerpts from the fable. The camera moves through the text, sometimes reading from left to right, and sometimes the other way around. It is a work in which Broodthaers was able to merge film, written text (poetry) and typography in an unprecedented way.\"  Continues on: http://www.macba.cat/en/le-corbeau-et-le-renard-1569.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
