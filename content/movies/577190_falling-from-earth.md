In 1975, a wanted man hides out in a public restroom, where the graffiti on the walls speaks of the ongoing war and the toll it has taken on those who live though it. In 1982, a woman wonders where her boyfriend has gone as her isolation comes up against the abrupt and unexpected violence that plagues the city. A segment set in 1990 depicts a family that's been emotionally shattered by years of war. And in 2008, an elderly man living in a building that's been decimated by bombs shows off the snapshots he collects, which depicts people living under happier circumstances.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tfEbWYgwFRIjNJVCDXG6SyNPbf0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
