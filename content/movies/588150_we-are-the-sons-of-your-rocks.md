He is troubled by the story of his father, which he heard when he was a boy. At the end of WWII, an Italian officer called Mazzola was captured by the partisans, and soon after shot and buried close to the old man\u2019s house. There is no tomb or trace; no real proof that the story is true. However, he is afraid of digging to see if any bones lie underneath. He turns to the remaining villagers in order to find out the truth. There are two men older than him, but their stories don\u2019t always match and are not easy to comprehend.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eSrqrskPxuUUV7BblbJgcBVIfBV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
