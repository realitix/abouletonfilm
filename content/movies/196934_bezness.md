His girlfriend deeply resents his having sex with other women but doesn't seem much bothered that a rich German man he's been having sex with is hoping to sponsor him in Europe. She also has a hard time with his tendency to behave like any other Arab male around a woman, telling her how to take care of her business. As it turns out, she's got better sense than any of the men around her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eXAjj3YjniSdr2rmjpLBgG4QVpO.jpg", "actors": ["Abdellatif Kechiche ()", "Jacques Penot ()", "Ghalia Lacroix ()", "Manfred Andrae ()", "Mustapha Adouani ()", "Ahmed Ragoubi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
