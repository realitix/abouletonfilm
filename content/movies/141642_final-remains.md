An eccentric psychiatrist with questionable credentials comes to town implicating the local mortician, Henry Parks. Claiming to be Henry's former doctor from a facility where Henry had been institutionalized, Dr. Gronig suggests that the mortician may not have been suitable for release and may be using his father's parlor as a cover for deeper, darker things. During the same week four young college students plan for the local Friday night bash, but Monte has bigger plans for them. He wants to do something different and takes them from party to the local mortuary for a kinky midnight treat. The problem is that some of the doctor's implications may have been true and for Monte, Sky, Tina and Tony, this will be a night they will never forget. That is if they survive.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b9MF0byMA0PtbKu85qcg20PYq0n.jpg", "actors": ["Leon Acord (Henry Parks)", "Michelle Bellaver (College girl)", "Bob Brindley (Deputy Kyle Dutton)", "Sarah Gaboury (EMT)", "Heather Hartmann (Tina)", "Mike Holley (College guy)", "Page Jackson (County Sheriff)", "Dan Lawson (Drop-out)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
