As he talks, we also see clips from his work, we watch him draw, and simple animation illustrates parts of his story. He talks about growing up on Sunset Boulevard, going to the beach, his enjoyment of Mark Twain, his mother's loving creativity, the connection of his personality to some of his cartoon characters, and the joy of being alive.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x4XWpwMJHlpDxn3G84Hu2fzb1wm.jpg", "actors": ["Chuck Jones (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
