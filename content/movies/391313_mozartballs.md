{"tmdb_id": 391313, "title": "Mozartballs", "original_title": "Mozartballs", "slug_title": "mozartballs", "date": "2006-01-28", "genre": ["Documentaire"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "MOZARTBALLS is a light-hearted tribute to Mozart and explores what he symbolizes in our age. The film features curious characters that embody the spirit of Mozart - from a retired Swiss school teacher obsessed by all things Mozart, to an ex-pop musician in Oklahoma who believes that her body is actually inhabited by Mozart's spirit; from a computer genius in California whose software has created a new Mozart cello concerto, to an Austrian astronaut who carried a score of \"The Magic Flute\" and delicious chocolate 'Mozartkugeln' into space. These are the individuals who inhabit MOZARTBALLS and through their strange and, at times, very moving stories, the viewer will be exposed to the liveliness, the magic and the obsession that Moart has become to so many music fans today. For them, Mozart defines the very essence of beauty in music, but he has become something more than that. Mozart is an icon, and for many he is still very much alive!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eqh83IaiPvTqjajfsInUV1dmGno.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
