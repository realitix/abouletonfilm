One of these was the Shadow Reflector, a mirror capable of making an exact copy of whomever's image is captured on its surface. The copy that would be created would have the same knowledge and skills as the original, but would be opposite in personality and loyal to the holder of the mirror. However, just as the mirror was created, Rigandi had mysteriously hid it and it had become an object of legend. The Professional Magic-users Society discovers maps and papers related to the Shadow Reflector, but the society's vice president Lagan steals these documents, hoping to find the mirror for himself and use it to create an army of sorcerers that would be loyal only to him - and with that, take over the entire world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q0tbTDZSPdF3xl14Oc9AbjCU4je.jpg", "actors": ["Maria Kawamura (Naga the Serpent (voice))", "Megumi Hayashibara (Lina Inverse (voice))", "Akira Ishida (Jeffrey-kun (voice))", "Rihoko Yoshida (Josephine (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
