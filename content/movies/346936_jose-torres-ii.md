We follow Torres from his training in preparation to challenge world lightweight champion Willie Pastrano, to the match and Torres\u2019 victory in 1965. The contrast between the nervous Torres before the match, filmed in painstaking detail, and the first round, filmed in one shot, is striking.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yTWJ6NHSSMWKTqDQYg1rjd5Gvg9.jpg", "actors": ["Hiroshi Akutagawa (Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
