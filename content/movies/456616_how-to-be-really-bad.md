Because she is totally bored there and also wants to have fun and explore the world, she makes a pact with her father: she is allowed to go to earth for a week - but she has to convert a good person to evil there. If she succeeds in this challenge, she may stay on earth forever, otherwise she'll be waving a hell of a boring job in the bookkeeping of the underworld.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uz0NeJCLnWUNkzeL0bV2hfpbydk.jpg", "actors": ["Emma Bading (Lilith)", "Janina Fautz (Greta Birnstein)", "Ludwig Simon (Samuel)", "Samuel Finzi (Teufel / Vater)", "Emilio Sakraya (Carlo)", "Oliver Korittke (Gabriel Birnstein)", "Alwara H\u00f6fels (Sibylle Birnstein)", "Matilda M\u00e4rz (Melody)", "Amina Merai (Daria)", "Theo Trebs (Eddie)", "Axel Stein (Lehrer Seidel)", "Johann von B\u00fclow (Schuldirektor Papenhoff)", "Joyce Ilg (Mathelehrerin Engelhard)", "Piet Fuchs (Assistent des Teufels)", "Thomas Clemens (Liliths Privatlehrer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
