Alice Faye is the loyal burleycue singer who helps make Baxter a success. His head turned by sudden fame, Baxter falls under the spell of a society woman (Mona Barrie) who has theatrical aspirations of her own. She marries Baxter, then convinces him to produce a string of \"artistic\" plays rather than his extravagant musical revues. The plays are flops, and the woman haughtily divorces Baxter. Faithful Alice Faye, who'd gone to London when her ex-beau was married, returns to the penniless Baxter. She and her burlesque buddies team up to pull Baxter out of his rut and put him on top again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5qdGozrcDe6P2QcB4ff4yaqEFk8.jpg", "actors": ["Warner Baxter (Kerry Bolton)", "Alice Faye (Pat Doran)", "Jack Oakie (Joe Cooney)", "Mona Barrie (Rosalind Cleve)", "Arline Judge (Connie)", "Dixie Dunbar (Marie)", "Gregory Ratoff (Kolpolpeck)", "Herbert Mundin (English Impresario)", "Fats Waller (Ben)", "Nick Long Jr. (Anthony Lamb)", "Kenny Baker (Arthur)", "Charles Quigley (Stanley Drake)", "Paxton Sisters (Specialty Dancers)", "Al Shaw (Lew Henkle)", "Sam Lee (Gus Keefe)", "Jane Wyman (Dancer (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
