In \"I Liked His Old Stuff Better\" Kinane chooses to marvel rather than rue such experiences as falling in the shower and receiving pickled eggs as a token of love. It is his second special for Comedy Central.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sRp00eLbIOLisEobo5fFhWTo4nq.jpg", "actors": ["Kyle Kinane (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
