The sentimental issues come when Cantinflas falls in love of his pretty neighborhood (Silvia Pinal), who is handicapped and unable to walk. The thing wont be easy, because a young military man also has feelings for the girl. But the porter wants to see her happy, and he will become a sort of Cyrano De Bergerac, writing love letters to her signed by the young soldier. His plan is simple: to win money in the horse races in order to pay the operation which will make her walk again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5IrvEWVxlGkNQ9c8LZ7dC5sgl6m.jpg", "actors": ["Cantinflas (Cantinflas)", "Silvia Pinal (Rosita)", "Carlos Mart\u00ednez Baena (Don Sebastian, el profe)", "\u00d3scar Pulido (Elpidio)", "Fernando Casanova (Ra\u00fal)", "Jos\u00e9 Baviera (Dr. Perfecto Lozano)", "Josefina del Mar (La vecina bailarina)", "Conchita Gentil Arcos (Do\u00f1a Cuca, vecina)", "Pepe Mart\u00ednez (Profesor examinador)", "Pedro Elviro (Don Fortino)", "Ricardo Adalid (Amigo de Ra\u00fal en fiesta (uncredited))", "Felipe de Flores (Amigo de Ra\u00fal en fiesta (uncredited))", "Stephen Berne (Masajista (uncredited))", "Victorio Blanco (Hombre en velorio (uncredited))", "Rodolfo Calvo (Hombre en velorio (uncredited))", "Carmen Cabrera (Miembra del patronato (uncredited))", "Mar\u00eda Valdealde (Miembra del patronato (uncredited))", "Paco Mart\u00ednez (Miembro del patronato (uncredited))", "F\u00e9lix Samper (Miembro del patronato (uncredited))", "Jaime Calpe (Estudiante inteligente (uncredited))", "Jos\u00e9 Luis Moreno (Estudiante (uncredited))", "Ismael P\u00e9rez (Estudiante (uncredited))", "Jorge P\u00e9rez (Estudiante (uncredited))", "Lupe Carriles (Vecina chismosa (uncredited))", "Mar\u00eda Gentil Arcos (Vecina chismosa (uncredited))", "Lupe del Castillo (Vecina (uncredited))", "Regino Herrera (Vecino (uncredited))", "Enrique Carrillo (El tarz\u00e1n, vecino pachuco (uncredited))", "Jorge Chesterking (John, amigo de Perfecto (uncredited))", "Edmundo Espino (Esposo de Guadalupe (uncredited))", "Elodia Hern\u00e1ndez (Do\u00f1a Guadalupe (uncredited))", "Rafael Icardo (Secretario (uncredited))", "Jos\u00e9 Pardav\u00e9 (Lechero (uncredited))", "Salvador Quiroz (Empleado carrera caballos (uncredited))", "Humberto Rodr\u00edguez (Empleado secretaria (uncredited))", "Jaime Jim\u00e9nez Pons (Estudiante (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [82779, 82787, 30131, 41004], "youtube_key": "Nr9M2OmUO9s"}
