Lucky is a US-based software professional, and is a teetotaler, always abiding by the pressure and demands of his parents, so much to the fact that he does not have the courage to speak out that he already has a girlfriend. Bharath Kumar, the youngest son, the character played by Diganth, is a carefree individual with weird ideas on life. Bharath meets a tomboyish girl, Ambika, who is the house-owner's niece, and they begin to mingle well due to the nature of their personalities.  However, following a few unusual twists and turns, the alliance is called off and the groom's family members walk out due to embarrassment. Ambika, who has now developed a strong feeling of love towards Bharath, goes ahead and confronts him. And finally, Bharath too says yes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pEdmzpytt2YyerfLgTTRkoKVRHV.jpg", "actors": ["Pawan Kumar (Bharat Kumar)", "Nidhi Subbaiah (Ambika)", "Anant Nag (Wanderer (Nameless))", "Ramya Barna (Latha)", "Padmaja Rao (Padma)", "Sudha Belavadi (Vaishali)", "Nagendra Shah (Narayan Rao)", "Raju Talikote (Raju Talikote)", "Mithra (Keshavananda Swamiji)", "Diganth Manchale (Bharath Kumar)", "Priyanka Upendra (Cameo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [63644, 63642], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
