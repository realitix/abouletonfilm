Every night at the door of this little-known basement facility the same entry ritual takes place, resulting in confrontations which can sometimes turn violent. Those on duty at the shelter have the difficult task of \u201ctriaging the poor\u201d: the women and children first, then the men. Although the total capacity at the shelter is 100, only 50 \u201cchosen ones\u201d will be admitted inside and granted a warm meal and a bed. The others know it will be a long night.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oSeVWCHGPdQIWnTbqj8gQB1Y0HL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
