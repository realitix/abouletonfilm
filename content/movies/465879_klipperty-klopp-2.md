In the re-make K\u00f6tting's protagonist is a woman moving very slowly within the almost identical landscape to exactly the same soundtrack. Married up shot for shot with the original super 8 footage, K\u00f6tting sees the work as a digital artefact dug up and re-presented 33 years after the event.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
