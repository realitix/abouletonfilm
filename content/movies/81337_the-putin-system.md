Russia is once again flexing its muscles. This time its weapons are not the Red Army or its nuclear arsenal, but the huge energy resources lying under the Siberian tundra.  Vladimir Putin is the man responsible for the reemergence of Russia as a global power, but how much is really known about him and his ascendance? This film explores his journey to the highest echelons of the Kremlin and contextualizes his rise against a newly belligerent Russia nostalgic for the past glories of the Soviet empire.  This investigative documentary covers 30 years in the history of Russia through the personal history of Vladimir Putin: a man who has single-mindedly played all the rules of the game to reach the throne of power.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tIP5p1P8N3mrFO4WXOsp9ZARMcS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
