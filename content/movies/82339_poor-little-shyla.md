One afternoon she is subjected to the cruel machinations of Faye and Georgia who forcibly bind and undress her before they are interrupted by Faye's horrified mother.  In the ensuing aftermath, parents and therapists attempt to counsel the young girls in order to help them better understand their behavior and lesbian tendencies.
