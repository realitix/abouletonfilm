The viewer does not see the actual play but hears it along with the unfavorable audience reaction. Chekhov would overcome this initial failure to become one of Russia's best-known authors. His classics have inspired filmmakers from all over the world. Jia Savina also appears in this drama of a play within a play.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jwOknPpd0ICwzROIoRNvrCvnhGe.jpg", "actors": ["Nikolay Grinko (Anton Pavlovich Chekhov)", "Marina Vlady (Lika)", "Iya Savvina (Mariya Pavlovna Chekhova)", "Rolan Bykov (Mikhail Pavlovich Chekhov)", "Yevgeni Lebedev (Pavel Yegorovich Chekhov)", "Aleksandra Panova (Yevgeniya Yakovlevna Chekhova)", "Yuriy Yakovlev (Potapenko)", "Leonid Gallis (Gilyarovskiy)", "Vladimir Osenev (Kurbatov)", "Yekaterina Vasilyeva (Ovchinnikova)", "Sergei Kulagin (kupets Gribov)", "Yevgeni Shutov (otets Gerasim)", "Viktor Avdyushko (Krestyanin)", "Georgi Tusuzov (Suflyor)", "Svetlana Svetlichnaya (Afrodita Popandos)", "Aleksandr Shirvindt ()", "Igor Kvasha ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
