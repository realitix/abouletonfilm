What began as a weekly escape from the daily grind of work and family responsibilities, gradually evolved into a more serious commitment. Inspired by classical Esther Williams techniques from the 1950s, this group of train drivers and meat buyers, archivists and teachers soon became passionate exponents of the sport.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xtECKVwpwaUm5xT4Wi6eAeRgDvc.jpg", "actors": ["Simon Stadin (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "QU6z9oVvfKo"}
