McDowell was dying from AIDS-related illnesses during the production of the diary.  \u201cAn elegy for McDowell, the videowork captures Kuchar\u2019s mournful remembrances of his long-lasting friendship with the young filmmaker. But it also has the inquisitive charm, perverse humor, and quirky candor that places Kuchar\u2019s visual expressions in a gritty niche all their own.\u201d  \u2014Steve Seid, George Kuchar in Person (Berkeley: Pacific Film Archives, 1988)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sg7Uhy0BuqeQooKlpvQ7VsbJHnq.jpg", "actors": ["George Kuchar ()", "Mike Kuchar ()", "Curt McDowell ()", "Mark Ellinger ()", "Melinda McDowell ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
