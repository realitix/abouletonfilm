When team owner Mike Ilitch moved the Tigers into Comerica Park in 2000 with the help of public funds, it marked the end of an era -- but it didn't erase the affection many fans still hold for one of America's last remaining classic-era ballparks. This documentary celebrates Tiger Stadium's rich history, recounts the long struggle to keep the team from abandoning the old park, and takes a critical look at its current state of neglect.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l0OWRUn6g9NkLKIBVbbmx7cw8ir.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
