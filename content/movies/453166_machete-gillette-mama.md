Mama", "slug_title": "machete-gillette-mama", "date": "1989-01-01", "genre": ["Documentaire"], "score": "6.0/10", "synopsis": "\"With characteristic wit and rigor, experimental filmmaker Larry Gottheim here applies his impressionistic editing style to footage collected during his travels in the Dominican Republic. Gottheim\u2019s formal emphasis on repetition and fissures between sound and image resonates here as a mode of sociological reflection (with the fragmentary montage mirroring elements of ritual while also destabilizing the ethnographic gaze). A largely overlooked antecedent to the contemporary blending of avant-garde and ethnographic filmmaking, MACHETTE GILLETTE\u2026 MAMA still poses a potent challenge to documentary convention.\" - Max Goldberg", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lGxDUwlsmTywbnTXWmTbE0PlEoc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
