The program contains interviews with experts Stanton Friedman, a nuclear physicist and UFO researcher, and George Fawcett, ufologist. Dr. Jesse Marcel Jr. tells of when he held, in his own hands, debris from the Foster Ranch, and Walter Haut, Public Information Officer for the 509th Bomb Unit at Roswell Army Airfield in 1947, recalls typing the press release: \"The RAAF captures flying saucer.\" There is also an interview with Glenn Dennis, a mortician at the Ballard Funeral Home in Roswell, in 1947. The Base Hospital called him requesting child-sized coffins, and inquired about preserving bodies that were in the desert heat for several days. You'll be able to decide for yourself if it was really, as the U.S. Government claims, just a weather balloon. ~ Madeline Cavalieri, Rovi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dFZsKdFyAth7B1ZBFdaIB7Ae8fK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
