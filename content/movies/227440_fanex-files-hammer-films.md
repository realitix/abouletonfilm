Filled with shocking clips, terrifying trailers, and fascinating interviews with cast and crew culled from twenty years of the FANEX Film Convention archives, this film is a horror fan's delight!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/orC4ZBS7F7QETJsIQAtEy56f7fC.jpg", "actors": ["Aaron Christensen (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
