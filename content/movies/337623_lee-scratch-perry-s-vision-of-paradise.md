It is the life story of the legendary musician, but it is not a biography, it is a fairytale documentary! The director followed Lee Perry for thirteen years and discovered an unbelievable story, a revelation, told about and with one of the major protagonists of contemporary music, the other half of the story that has never been told. The movie can be seen as a guide for how to change the world with music, with a positive attitude, mindset or, as Lee Perry calls it, vibration.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1ShCRcygRfReacb3Vwwx8J7QTNX.jpg", "actors": ["Lee \"Scratch\" Perry ()", "Adrian Sherwood ()", "Neil \"Mad Professor\" Fraser ()", "Dennis Bovell ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
