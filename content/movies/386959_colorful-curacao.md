We enter from the harbor and sail up the only main street in the world that accommodates ships. An off-screen narrator summarizes Curacao's history -- the colony of several European powers, its role in the slave trade, its mix of races, the native orange that produces a popular liqueur, and its near-duty-free oil refining. We see the Queen Emma Bridge and we hear about Dutch religious tolerance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Krev3c0JKitIQdQ1zy4dd3RYbI.jpg", "actors": ["James A.
