It's also an appropriate follow-up to The Intimate Duke Ellington; whereas the latter showcases Ellington as a solo pianist and in small group settings, Live at the Tivoli Gardens features the Ellington Orchestra in all its splendor. It includes two approximately 70-minute sets recorded a few days apart in 1971, when the Duke was 72.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c4Mv1ej4pk3VW90lij2Kkjmao1M.jpg", "actors": ["Duke Ellington (as himself)", "Harry Carney (as himself)", "Paul Gonsalves (as himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
