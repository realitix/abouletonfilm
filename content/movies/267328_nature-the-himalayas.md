Coniferous and subtropical forests, wetlands, and montane grasslands are as much a part of this world as the inhospitable, frozen mountaintops that tower above.  The word Himalaya is Sanskrit for abode of snow, fitting for a stretch of land that houses the world\u2019s largest non polar ice masses. Extensive glacial networks feed Asia's major rivers including the Ganges, Indus, and Brahmaputra. More than a billion people rely on these glacier-fed water sources for drinking water and agriculture. The Himalayas are not only a remarkable expanse of natural beauty. They're also crucial for our survival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7DBOjBit2I2GLkPxBp1uEDnra0a.jpg", "actors": ["Chris Morgan (Himself / Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
