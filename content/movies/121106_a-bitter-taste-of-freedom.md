At age 48 she was assassinated for simply doing her job. This documentary is based on Anna's conversations with filmmaker Marina Goldovskaya, Anna's former university professor and personal friend. Shot over a period of 20 years, this exclusive footage creates an incredible story of a woman who consciously gave her life for her convictions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hOG5IE1L4SZoViGPYAqqnV9XJas.jpg", "actors": ["Mikhail Gorbachev ()", "Anna Politkovskaya ()", "Karinna Moskalenko ()", "Alla Bossart ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "5lDdd3b5m6E"}
