His friend Noam Chomsky says that Zinn litteraly transformed a generation's conscience. Zinn talks about those who have no voice in the official History : Slaves, Indians, deserters, textile workers, union men. On two occasions in Paris and Boston we were lucky enough to meet and film him. Towards the end of his life, Howard Zinn said , \"I want to be remembered as someone who enabled people to experience hope and power something they never did before.\" That is exactly the reason why we want to make this film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zhtxEe6yz0vARaadcUMMMkiJmOE.jpg", "actors": ["Howard Zinn (Self)", "Noam Chomsky (Self)", "Chris Hedges (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "VTccJ1ndh0M"}
