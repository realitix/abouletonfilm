None of them had ever made a feature-length movie before, but they used their creative talents and sense of teamwork from Disney to create Beer Drinkers in Space. The movie took nine months to complete and consumed their lives and their homes as they constructed spaceship interior sets in family rooms, bedrooms, and garages. Elaborate models and pyrotechnics were shot. The script was transferred to cue cards and the intrepid movie makers popped open a few beers and got in front of the cameras to shoot this camp comedy feature. 23 years after the movie was created, Beer Drinkers in Space writer/director Frank Delle found and interviewed every person involved with the project. Using these new interviews, as well as photographs, raw footage, behind the scenes footage and clips from the movie, he created the documentary Keep Drinking Men!
