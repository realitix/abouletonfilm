To some point, this is justified. Bloody Brotherhood doesn't really offer up anything new or do it in any sort of spectacular fashion. In fact, many parts of the film are merely adequate, or even sub-par. However, after watching a spate of recent half-ass over-CGIed movies, Bloody Brotherhood brought back memories of a time when even the most average HK crime/action flick was better than anything Hollywood could (or would) churn out.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1KnZOxB5xznD3lONI9AJNbRi15o.jpg", "actors": ["Andy Lau (Cheung Ka-Wah)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
