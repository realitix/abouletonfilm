When Bloom's two teenage sons, Nate and Skylar accidentally shoot and kill Dick during a deer-hunt, Bloom's long-held allegiance to the reigning Cavanaugh clan is tested. Skylar (still a minor) decides to take the wrap for his older brother Nate, claiming he fired the fatal shot. The Cavanaugh family's quick retaliation sends Skylar on his way to county jail, soon to be tried as an adult. Desperate and guilt-ridden, Nate breaks Skylar out of jail and sets off a chain of lawless acts, which send them deep into the woods and on the run. Bloom's choice between the law and his sons leads to revelations of old family secrets that threaten to destroy everything he loves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eEeISpn5dCXwkixBO14bbXdxZTS.jpg", "actors": ["Martin Starr (Lloyd Cavanaugh)", "Michael Bowen (Randy Cavanaugh)", "Greg Cipes (Guthrie Cavanaugh)", "Matthew Lillard (Jack Cavanaugh)", "Justine Bateman (Cheryl Cavanaugh)", "Abraham Benrubi (Michael Spencer)", "Ted Levine (Bloom Towne)", "Spencer Treat Clark (Nate Towne)", "Nick Eversman (Skylar Towne)", "Nicolas Christenson (Tony Cavanaugh)", "Shawn Shultz (Harry Cavanaugh)", "Peter Coventry Smith (Joel Cavanaugh)", "Stacey Travis (Melanie Cavanaugh)", "Scott Tree (Skip Cavanaugh)", "Blayne Weaver (Tom Cavanaugh)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [132236, 25354, 184710, 52855], "youtube_key": "TBn2pZk0XTU"}
