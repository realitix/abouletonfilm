The film blends a variety of appropriated material \u2014 including a homeless demonstration during the gala premiere of an Atom Egoyan film at the Toronto Film Festival \u2014 with archival footage of circuses, westerns, and Pierre Burton discussing the pros and cons of building a bomb shelter. Shelter also celebrates the inherent qualities of the film medium, qualities that have quickly become marginalized through the current obsession with digital technology.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
