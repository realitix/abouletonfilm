In the dead of winter in the mountain valley of Missoula, Montana, Doris has just returned to the U.S. after years teaching English abroad. At the local university, she forms a small community with her class of international students. But outside she is alienated, unable to form meaningful connections. Doris explores the town, coming across clues to a recent legacy of displaced persons: an old photograph of an Indian camp, a row of Japanese graves in the local cemetery. And she is haunted by a strange encounter with a boy, who lives in a motel on the edge of town. As winter begins to thaw, she and her students must consider the complexities of adapting and belonging. What if home is no longer a place, but just an idea? Could you lose yourself completely? The next decision they make will redefine not only their lives, but their very identities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sVvAiJvGJ5SPBPbLjPyxgX00UdB.jpg", "actors": ["Kathleen Wise (Doris)", "Hiroka Matsushima (Yuri)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
