A female voice reads a mythological text on the origin of the world and sets the tone for a documentary-meditation on the presence of primeval elements \u2013 like water and flora \u2013 and their cohabitation with the natives, whose portraits intersperse the film. The stealthy camera follows a boat drifting across the calm waters of a river, as if the latter were the rings of a tree disclosing its history, in a movement that lulls us and drives us to the physical and metaphysical core. Finally, accompanied by an ancestral chant, the etching gives way to a sequence of images (which in turn emerge like a river reducing the field of action to the essential) and moves into a poetic terrain, summoning the imagination of each one.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rnuCSCeTX1Sg4hgwoTwk0qQNw0d.jpg", "actors": ["Adriana Villa (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
