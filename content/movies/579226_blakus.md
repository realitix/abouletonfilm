She\u2019s running away from annoying neighbours and general sense of pointlessness; he\u2019s running away from a failing marriage. They\u2019re both young, talented, and lost; they both want to become artists; they\u2019re both unsure how to go on about their lives. Maybe that\u2019s why their shared trip turns into a strange, sometimes funny and sometimes complicated journey through a relationship over the course of three years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tyLByYSfEbtu8BcBtyobtat31uk.jpg", "actors": ["Anta Aizupe (Louise)", "\u0100ris Matesovi\u010ds (Kaspars)", "Uldis Sni\u0137ers ()", "J\u0101nis Sni\u0137ers ()", "Gatis Maliks ()", "Ivars Krasts ()", "\u0122irts Jakov\u013cevs ()", "Vizma Kalme ()", "Aiva Birbele ()", "Jana Herbsta ()", "Marta Grigale ()", "Armands Ikalis ()", "Henrijs Ar\u0101js ()", "Gerda Embure ()", "Am\u0113lija \u0100bolti\u0146a ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "cTWvtaVI1YA"}
