Some of the most sumptuous and involving films revolve around that most common of acts: eating. 18 MEALS is an omnibus film of criss-crossing stories divided into three segments; breakfast, lunch and dinner. Jorge Coira's debut feature, shot over nine days in Santiago de Compostela has enough tasty portions to please audiences. Amongst Coira's expansive ensemble are aging street musician Edu, a pair awaking from a one-night stand, a businessman visiting his closeted homosexual brother and a lonely housewife, Sol. Victor and Sol are two of 18 MEALS' most fascinating characters as they each hide something - his sexuality, her depression - from those around them. Best of all is Pedro Alsono as Vladimir, a local celebrity actor who makes a meal for a mystery woman who never arrives. Who hasn't gone to a lot of trouble to do something extra special for someone just to have it go unappreciated?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/du034bC9dxxAMphWw4DMVkHK57i.jpg", "actors": ["Luis Tosar (Edu)", "Federico P\u00e9rez Rey (Tuto)", "V\u00edctor F\u00e1bregas (Fran)", "Esperanza Pedre\u00f1o (Sol)", "Gael Nodar Fern\u00e1ndez (Gael)", "Mario Zorrilla (Teo)", "Jos\u00e9 Barato (Lucas)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "63747057"}
