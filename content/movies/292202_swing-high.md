Doc May and Daphne, his wife, work as clowns; and Garry, a singing soldier of fortune, sings along with Maryan's act. Ruth, Maryan's partner, quits to get married; and Joe, who is jealous of Garry, replaces her with Trixie, his former assistant. When Garry announces his engagement to Maryan, Trixie persuades him to join a strip poker game in a drunken state and \"compromises\" him in the presence of his fianc\u00e9e. Grief-stricken, Maryan falls during her act, and Garry, robbed of circus funds, is arrested. In spite of her injuries, Maryan, learning of Trixie's treachery, performs the act with her and forces a confession by threatening to drop her; Garry is released and is welcomed back to the show.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d9NNwdRoDSPNx1eNQMeNE9Bmeqb.jpg", "actors": ["Helen Twelvetrees (Maryan)", "Fred Scott (Garry)", "Dorothy Burgess (Trixie)", "John Sheehan (Doc May)", "Daphne Pollard (Mrs. May)", "George Fawcett (Pop Garner)", "Bryant Washburn (Ringmaster Joe)", "Bryant Washburn (Billy)", "Sally Starr (Ruth)", "'Little Billy' Rhodes (Major Tiny)", "William Hall (Babe)", "Stepin Fetchit (Sam)", "Chester Conklin (Sheriff)", "Ben Turpin (Bartender)", "Robert Edeson (Doctor)", "Mickey Bennett (Mickey)", "Dannie Mac Grant ()", "Clarence Muse (Singer)", "Rolfe Sedan (Trouper)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
