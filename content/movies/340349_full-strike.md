One day she met a brunch of terrible weirdoes: the Drunken Master who was lying on the ground, one-armed Lam Chiu, visually-impaired Ma Kun, and the scar-faced boss Lau Dan who suffered from loss of hearing. They were the most notorious robbers 10 years ago, but they decided to be good men after they got out from jail and formed the \"Lau Dan Badminton Club\". Sau was impressed by them and decided to join Dan and practice seriously and go to the competition together.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1enHeQcDyH3esIYmOVQYJhbLoxF.jpg", "actors": ["Josie Ho (Beast Ng Kau Sau)", "Ronald Cheng (Suck Nipple Cheung)", "Tse Kwan-Ho (Ng Kau Chun)", "Ekin Cheng (Lau Dan)", "Wilfred Lau (Ma Kun)", "Edmond Leung (Lam Chiu)", "Andrew Lam (Champion Chik)", "Siu Yam-Yam (Grandma Mui)", "Eric Kwok Wai-Leung (Wong Lung Wai)", "Grace Yip (Kau-sau's rival)", "Michael Tse (Inspector Cheung)", "Philip Keung (Brother Crazy Dog)", "Julius Brian Siswojo (Gangster)", "Harriet Yeung (Lancy Lam)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
