One day, one of her kids - Jack - says \"I know what to do,\" and takes off with a sack of beans. Well, to make a long story short, we wind up seeing \"Jack And The Beanstalk\" and mom winds up a rich woman in the end. The show goes from a beat-old boot to a glittery high heel shoe!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
