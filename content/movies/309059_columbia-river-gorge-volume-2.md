It is a spot of unparalleled beauty that hosts two railroad lines: BNSF to the north and Union Pacific along the southern shore.  In Columbia River Gorge Volume I: BNSF's Fallbridge Subdivision, Pentrex explored the BNSF side of the Gorge, heading east from Vancouver, Washington to the arid desert mountains near the John Day Dam. Now, in Volume 2, we jump across the river to head back west toward Portland following Union Pacific's Portland Subdivision.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tL2m7CcTmmvGhA5ORe1eHJpHRvN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
