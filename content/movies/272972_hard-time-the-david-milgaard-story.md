Now he's the main suspect and soon faces a life sentence for a crime he didn't commit. His mother, Joyce, crusades for his release, but every attempt for appeal or parole is denied because he won't admit to the crime he didn't do. As David's will to survive erodes, his mother's determination to maintain her son's innocence and fight to win his freedom thrives.
