At this time, the Soviet Union was starting to fall apart, and with this came the start of a number of ethnic conflicts. Fariz and his family move into a Baku apartment block from war-torn Nagorno-Karabakh. Fariz's relations with his new neighbors are strained by his accusations that it was people like them who failed to support the Azeris in their conflict with ethnic Armenians. The only one who stands up to him is Alik, who acts as peacemaker between him and the older inhabitants of the building. Alik has no reservations about brandishing his gun in order to keep the peace. One day, the apartment managers want to evict a number of musicians who have been squatting in the basement. Alik gets involved, but soon discovers the situation is more complicated that he first believed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wqfD0ktyrpQ00Knb2AXrtR0EDAt.jpg", "actors": ["Timur Badalbeyli (Alik)", "Mehriban Zaki (Maya)", "Fuad Poladov (Fariz)", "Fakhraddin Manafov (Rza)", "Rafig Aliyev (Nazim)", "Kamal Khudaverdiyev (Ismail)", "Sanubar Isgandarli ()", "Elmira Shabanova (Khanimana)", "Shamil Suleymanov ()", "Hadji Ismailov ()", "Tofig Mirzayev ()", "Sadig Ahmadov (Officer)", "Hasan Seyidbeyli (Badjioghlu)", "Teymur Mirzayev ()", "Arif Hadjiyev ()", "Rauf Babayev ()", "Javan Zeynalli ()", "Shahin Novrasli ()", "Natig Shirinov ()", "Aleksandra Anikushina (Lusya)", "Yana Nikitina ()", "Naiba Allahverdiyeva ()", "Elbrus Vahidov ()", "Arif Karimov ()", "Tofig Huseynov ()", "Manaf Dadashov ()", "Intigam Soltan ()", "Maharram Musayev ()", "Arif Gasimov ()", "Adil Gulamov ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
