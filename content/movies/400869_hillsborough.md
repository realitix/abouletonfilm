Beginning with that fateful day, 15 April 1989, the film details the horror of the tragedy, told through the experiences of those directly involved: fans, survivors, family members and police officers. Many speak publicly for the first time. It captures the horror of the crush on the terraces, revealing the prejudices held by the police towards football fans.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Ajix3pfuVtatSplUlSktjw6ZHEC.jpg", "actors": ["Margaret Aspinall (Herself)", "David Duckenfield (Himself)", "Tony Evans (Himself)", "Abdul Hakim Joy (Jury Member)", "Steve Leighton (Phil Scraton)", "Martin McLoughlin (Himself)", "Phil Scraton (Himself)", "Patricia Winker (Librarian, House of Lords)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "qBbifoVdyGM"}
