When seventeen-year-old Pedro defiantly befriends political fugitive Sofia and provides her shelter, he creates a deep rift between himself, his family and his friends. Sofia is hunted because she was at one time in love with a Communist sympathizer. At first the relationship is purely platonic as Pedro helps her recover from a 23-day long flight that has left Sofia weak and starving for sleep. But as time passes, Pedro becomes increasingly involved with her and his schoolwork begins to suffer. Gradually he falls in love with her and she with him. But as the political situation grows more oppressive and the government steps up its search for subversives, the two begin making desperate plans to flee the country.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/acLD86eXQWogjd3ANAIHiZaLFk8.jpg", "actors": ["Dora Baret (Sof\u00eda)", "Alejandro Milrud (Pedro)", "H\u00e9ctor Alterio (Padre de Pedro)", "Alejandro Milrud (Pedro)", "Graciela Dufau (Madre de Pedro)", "Nicolas Frei (Silvio Nu\u00f1ez)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
