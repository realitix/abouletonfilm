Events overtake Subbaiah Sastry, a highly respected vedic and scholar in his prime now scraping out a meagre existence as a corpse carrier. He endures the contempt of his Hyderabad neighbours due to his acceptance of Tiladaanam, a lowly Brahammic rite involving the acceptance of the sins of the dead in exchange for coins and the food of the deceased. His son, Raghuram, has become a terrorist hunted by the police, at odds with his father. A stark contrast is provided between an outdated system and as yet undefined future. - Melbourne International Film Festival", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p4b04vWfkhFUHaXV99OibaLm7u6.jpg", "actors": ["Dattatreya H.G.
