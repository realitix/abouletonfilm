And the brothers Garza do it with what remains rock &amp; roll's most basic and reliable format: the rock guitar trio. True, there's nothing earth-shatteringly original going on here; guitarist Henry, like many others from Texas and everywhere else, is channeling Jimi Hendrix via Stevie Ray Vaughan, with a little Carlos Santana on the side (Jojo is the outstanding bassist, while Ringo--his real name, by the way--plays drums, of course). But Los Lonely Boys bring something else to the party: good singing (all three are capable lead and harmony vocalists), and enough other influences, from Tex-Mex to the Beatles, to forge a distinctive, melodically appealing sound.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9CBABEZGEH1Lxl6nIHrIzCmU3z1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
