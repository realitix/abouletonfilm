The story is not unique. Olga (Ivana Ch\u00fdlkov\u00e1) graduated from college and started a successful career. But at the age of twenty-seven she married a twenty-year-old Vladimir (Alois \u0160vehl\u00edk), a man with a much lower education than she . Instead of continuing a career , she stayed at home, taking care of the household and raising three children (at the time of our story, Olga and Vladimir have been living for 15 years). She became a mere maid, from which obedience and 100% household care is expected without any recognition or gratitude.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/unqIjtw8XAj8OKwSvgMCRA4JfAh.jpg", "actors": ["Ivana Ch\u00fdlkov\u00e1 (Borsk\u00e1)", "Alois \u0160vehl\u00edk (Borsk\u00fd)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
