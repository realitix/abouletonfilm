Nothing seemed to have been taken from their run-down house so the police initially rule out robbery as a motive. They subsequently learn from Johannes's brother that the dead man was actually quite wealthy and when the bank confirms he withdrew a large sum every calendar quarter, they revise their ideas about a possible motive. Of equal concern to Wallander is a news report that Maria Johannes' last word to him before she died was that her attacker was a foreigner. Soon, the migrant farm workers in the area for the harvest are being targeted by vigilantes. Meanwhile, Wallander is having his own problems. He's in less than good health - he's a diabetic - and he's not sure he approves of his daughter's new boyfriend. As well, his father's dementia is worsening and he faces the prospect of having to institutionalize him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y2HZUgJ6aiZ0f6dMKLqPPanq8pQ.jpg", "actors": ["Kenneth Branagh (Kurt Wallander)", "Tom Hiddleston (Magnus Martinsson)", "Jeany Spark (Linda Wallander)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [299047, 298914], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
