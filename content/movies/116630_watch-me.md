One by one Tess's friends end up brutally murdered after opening the \"Watch Me\" email, a file that spreads through electronic address books to seek its next victim. All murders bear the same traits: a red-headed woman in a yellow dress, an internet connection, the victims' eyes sewn shut. As Tess becomes the next target in line, she finds herself seeking answers from Taku, an illegal film dealer with the unsavory nickname of \"freak boy\" and the moral integrity of a rattlesnake. But showing up voluntarily at Taku's lair, Tess finds herself in even more danger than when she was on her own. If the two can survive each other, they may just be able to live through this deadly email. As the clock ticks and the body count mounts, the two must untangle the puzzle to stop \"Watch Me\" from its poisonous rampage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9Ejo5dZ7zZ1mSbV0smhFwENKhc0.jpg", "actors": ["Celeste Barry (Rigby)", "Glen Hancox (Sanders)", "George Ivanoff (Lecturer)", "Katrina J.
