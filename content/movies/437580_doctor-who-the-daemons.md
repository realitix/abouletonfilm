Seeking to gain the ancient titan's demonic power, he gathers a cult and then corrupts or controls the residents of Devil's End to bow to his will. Dark elemental forces begin to disturb the village on the eve of May Day: unexplained murders, a stone gargoyle come to life, and a nigh-impenetrable infernal energy dome. With the Master fully prepared to destroy the Earth, the Doctor and UNIT - aided by a benevolent practitioner of witchcraft - battle the wicked rites of a secret science weilded by an alien from another world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7IIX3rqqiarODwJowYYQUPX5icC.jpg", "actors": ["Jon Pertwee (The Doctor)", "Katy Manning (Jo Grant)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
