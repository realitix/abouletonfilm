He feels victimized enough, both for the prison time and for the crime which led to it; he committed the crime to give his wife the nice things she asked him for. When he discovers that she has remarried a quite wealthy man, he is outraged. However, his ire is not due to her disloyalty to him; he loved their only son to distraction, and now the boy has no knowledge or memory of him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aDqSAmz2jXdR6HIIHTkLtp4do7k.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
