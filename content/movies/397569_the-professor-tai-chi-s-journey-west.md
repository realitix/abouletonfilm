Though Cheng is an important transformational figure, his teachings have been overlooked. This documentary film tells the story of his remarkable life and features Tai Chi as a martial art and a spiritual practice. Over the past decade, we have shot approximately fifty hours of footage in New York, North Carolina, and California.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/grAkVJRqLTB9GjR9Y39F1YVpNUM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
