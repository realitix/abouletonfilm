In her recent films, Geiser has been exploring the possibilities found in merging video texture with film, creating a lush, disorienting, ambiguous film space and an atmosphere of temporal suspension. In TERRACE 49, the space is shattered further, broken into shards: as fractured as memory and as fragile as glass.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tPk91O8Tx209Gc2269kBzNmjoa9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
