Voyeurism runs through the history of narrative and is here one of the threads that structure the film. Playing with the fiction of love in love stories, the film invites a different experience of cinema with non-naturalistic acting and layered interaction of performed reality, memory and imagination.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/abRCw6I3Mhpc7ycBNTFJgB4cLE8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
