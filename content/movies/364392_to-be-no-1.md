He's tough; he's respected by his friends; he loves Apple, daughter of his boss in the small-time Hung Lok gang in Wanchai; and, he encourages the studies of Chun, the son of his mother's closest relative. When Chuen comes to the attention of Piu, a top triad boss, the Hung Lok gang is assigned a hit; Chuen commits the murder and then is frustrated when Apple's father takes the fall. Chuen's cockiness gets him in trouble again when he disobeys Piu to revenge a friend's death. Chuen, who's reached the police bulletin board's most wanted, is now expendable. Can he and Apple escape to the Mainland?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hoyFyu8FYAQsC7XLRq6O9pXEzUM.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Chan (Piu Goh)", "Danny Lee Sau-Yin (Kin Sir)", "Simon Yam (Magic Lamp)", "Wu Ma ([Cameo])", "Julian Cheung (Fei Chuen)", "Kar-Lei Cheng ()", "Heung Lui ()", "Lindsey Huang ()", "Kai Cheung-Lung ()", "Peter Lai Bei-Dak ()", "Lam Wai ()", "Law Wai-Kai ()", "Ben Ng ()", "Frankie Ng ()", "Dino Kwoh Tai Tang ()", "Allen Ting ()", "Kwong-Ji To ()", "Vincent Wan Yeung-Ming ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
