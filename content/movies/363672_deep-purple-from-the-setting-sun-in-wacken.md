During this concert, Deep Purple left their \u201csafe zone\u201d. That is why this concert is the one that represents a feeling of improvisation and electricity similar to the band's classic years - more than many other live releases by the band. The show has been filmed by 9 HD cameras and it is also available in 3D on the Blu-ray version (the first time for Deep Purple)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/whDxhWypakw03W1EeCcvbQtSxsk.jpg", "actors": ["Ian Gillan (Himself)", "Ian Paice (Himself)", "Roger Glover (Himself)", "Steve Morse (Himself)", "Don Airey (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
