This is the tale of Dominic, a man with a dark past who returns to the small town he's long since abandoned, to bury his niece Lexie, who has recently passed. Dragging his troubled daughter Kendall along with him, he simultaneously reunites with his estranged sister, Stella and reignites a past rivalry with the corrupt town sheriff, Rex Drisko. Convinced that there is more behind Lexie's death than is being said, Dominic begins digging around the town, probing its strange inhabitants, and in the process unearths his own demons and uncovers the town's dark secrets, which include a mysterious cult, a supernatural curse, a masked killer, and a very high body count. Everyone is both a suspect and potential victim, and only one thing is for sure: the Earth will be stained red before Dominic uncovers the truth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nnVPNY1mrCHcq5WNaIcM8LcuvL1.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Gobin (Dominic Merrick)", "Jim Dougherty (Sheriff Rex Drisko)", "Kayla Crance (Kendall)", "Angela Steele (Stella)", "Rosalind Rubin (Kacie)", "Scott Ganyo (Father Gabriel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "N8dKSZyw-q8"}
