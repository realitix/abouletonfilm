Right after the events back then, the responsibility for the accident was considered to be negligence of the engineer and the engineer\u2019s assistant. The topic of this project was the promotion of a new device to avoid accidents. However, I had seen that the true cause of the accident was a congested service schedule, and I consciously placed emphasis on the depiction of the actual work of the engineer and his assistant, and of those who had chosen the route and were responsible for safety on the line on which the accident took place.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/svFpRHR5VY5CYI0exHJcby47uaA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
