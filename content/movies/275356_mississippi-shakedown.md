Business deals are conducted through gun-toting strippers who will do anything for money. Sip, a Mississippi born hustler, leaves graveyards filled with remains of those who crossed The Sip Boyz. Things turn sour when they steal from the boss, a Baton Rouge drug lord; the boss sends Black, a heartless hit-man in for retaliation and retribution.
