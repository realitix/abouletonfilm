After a break-up, they each experience their own rough patch. For David, a self-destructive artistic endeavor and a relationship with an immature beauty\u2014for Brenda, a failing acting career, an eviction notice, and a boyfriend who just doesn\u2019t do it for her. A chance encounter brings them together on the streets of New York at a particularly bad time. David invites Brenda to the opening of his first photography exhibit and the stage is set for a night of drinking and flirting which leads to an untraditional proposal of how they can be together without getting back together. A sharply observed, un-romantic comedy by writer/director Mel Rodriguez III, IN STEREO is a stylish and striking first feature that offers an unflinching look at the complexity of modern relationships.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bPNbx7qTC6DIlIhhKyDxtGbHPu5.jpg", "actors": ["Beau Garrett (Brenda Schiffer)", "Aimee Mullins (Trisha Bontecou)", "Maggie Geha (Paula)", "Mario Cantone (John Resnick)", "Micah A.
