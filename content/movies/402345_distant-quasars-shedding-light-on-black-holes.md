By observing its quasar. As objects get pulled onto the accretion disk orbiting a supermassive black hole, friction creates a bright light known as a quasar. In this video, researchers use a \u201cgalaxy-sized lens\u201d to analyze light from a distant quasar\u2014revealing a supermassive black hole with a truly voracious appetite.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kzBq5SBRmtCcWWAYIEiMri9Vicy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
