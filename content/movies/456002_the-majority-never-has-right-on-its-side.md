The school is known for its anti-authoritarian educational methods founded on the egalitarian principles of A.S. Neill, a socialist schoolmaster from Scotland often described as a \u201ccynical utopian\u201d. In this project, Almborg has been looking at the school today in relation to its image, by researching and using the school\u2019s film and video archive. The idea has been twofold: to trace a visual history of a place and to look at what can be described as a \u201cutopian image,\u201d how it might be constructed and what potentials and problems it might encompass.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
