Appearing with Muddy that night were his contemporaries Willie Dixon, Koko Taylor, Junior Wells and Pinetop Perkins, and from the next generation of blues lovers and performers, Mike Bloomfield, Buddy Miles, Johnny Winter, Dr. John, and Nick Gravenites -- all artists who were on their way to becoming legends themselves. What resulted from that joyous teaming was a truly historic session that not only presented some of the greatest blues classics ever written, but a never-to-be-forgotten hour that truly demonstrates the love of music by one generation for another.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pmodKFv1DVoRbNbVuoMf7d8OZ1P.jpg", "actors": ["Muddy Waters (Self/Performer)", "Johnny Winter (Self/Performer)", "Mike Bloomfield (Self/Performer)", "Junior Wells (Self/Performer)", "Dr. John (Self/Performer)", "Koko Taylor (Self/Performer)", "Willie Dixon (Self/Performer)", "Buddy Miles (Self/Performer)", "Nick Gravenites (Self/Performer)", "Pinetop Perkins (Self/Performer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
