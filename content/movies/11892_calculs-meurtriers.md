Sadly there's no psychological depth given the two boys by writer Tony Gayton, which renders the whole motives and means, and the investigation of such, as being a shallow exercise in thriller film making.\r\n\r\nRunning at two hours in length doesn't help matters, because this further irritates that more meat was not written onto Gosling and Pitt's bones, while it also exposes just how hackneyed and clich\u00e9d the picture is. Which when the story should be psychologically profound, marks this out as a frustrating viewing experience. 6/10"}], "recommandations_id": [1642, 9039, 12103, 10398]}
