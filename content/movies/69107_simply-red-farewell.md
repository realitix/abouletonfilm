There are no surprises, either in song selection or in his band's impeccably smooth approach, but comfort is the point of the whole affair: it's one last chance for fans to hear those songs again. For anybody who isn\u2019t a fan -- or got off board somewhere around the time when Stars turned Simply Red into sensations everywhere but the U.S. -- this will hardly be cause for re-evaluation, but Farewell does celebrate everything that made Mick Hucknall into an international superstar.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vyVfhviA9cz8sRfZ5fUYgekf9bJ.jpg", "actors": ["Mick Hucknall (Vocal)", "Ian Kirkham (Teclados e Sax)", "Kenji Suzuki (Guitarra)", "Dave Clayton (Teclados)", "Pete Lew\u00adin\u00adson (Bateria)", "Steve Lew\u00adin\u00adson (Contra-baixo)", "Kevin Robin\u00adson (Trompete e Flauta)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
