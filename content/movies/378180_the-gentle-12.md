Just as in that earlier work, this film takes place in a jury room and takes place in real time. The film opens as the jury is about to acquit the defendant -- a bar hostess who pushed her ex-husband path of an oncoming truck, supposedly in self-defense. Just as everyone seems to be in agreement over the woman's innocence, one bespectacled juror (Kazuyuki Aijima) -- no one is given names in this film -- voices second thoughts. Slowly, like an inversion of Henry Fonda's character in the earlier film, he sets about convincing his fellow jurors -- a group of nice folks who don't like thinking ill of people -- that the defendant is in fact a cold-blooded killer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mJ2B5qe30D9BIXCvysEdxohGFKI.jpg", "actors": ["Sansei Shiomi (Juror #1)", "Kazuyuki Aijima (Juror #2)", "K\u00f4ichi Ueda (Juror #3)", "Kouichi Nihei (Juror #4)", "Mariko Nakamura (Juror #5)", "Hiroshi \u00d4k\u00f4chi (Juror #6)", "Zen Kajiwara (Juror #7)", "Yorie Yamashita (Juror #8)", "Katsumi Muramatsu (Juror #9)", "Michiko Hayashi (Juror #10)", "Etsushi Toyokawa (Juror #11)", "Yoshihiro Kat\u00f4 (Juror #12)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
