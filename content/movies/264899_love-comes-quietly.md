In the 1920s, even the somewhat more tolerant people of the Netherlands (relative to the rest of Europe) did not easily suffer the open flouting of the rules of society. Cheerful and optimistic, Angela (Barbara Hershey) defied the conventions of her conservative Dutch family by traipsing about the countryside with her lover, living on what turned up each day. However, even for the sunniest of optimists such an idyll can have tragic consequences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7GM4yfJ4T1AtlGSka7HmTFIu4PC.jpg", "actors": ["Barbara Hershey (Angela)", "Ralph Meeker (Ben Hoeksema)", "Ward de Ravet (Menno Dijkstra)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
