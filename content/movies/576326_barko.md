His seemingly random fear of hot dogs is rationalized by flashbacks conveying a former owner who occupies his time tormenting the poor pup with the processed snack. Yet, in the end, Barko suddenly finds himself in the arms of a caring boy who shows him that he can experience a little love after all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5Jop9nyNIHrl40VmP8nQ1KjPAN6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
