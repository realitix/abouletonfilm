Comprising a collection of exhibits, dioramas and curios -- most of which seemingly have nothing to do with the Jurassic period or technology -- the museum offers an intellectual trip down the rabbit hole. The film includes interviews with founder and curator David Wilson and an extensive tour of the museum's oddities. -", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4f6E84SFheR0QBnJMe9EkZSvhgK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
