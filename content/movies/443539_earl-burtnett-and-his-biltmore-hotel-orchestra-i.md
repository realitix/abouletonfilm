Burtnett introduces the musical numbers as well as the musician doing the tune and for the most part I thought this was fairly entertaining. \"Miss Annabelle Lee\" was the final number and probably the highlight of everything but the other numbers are well worth listening to.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fJyduaLV6IVAweDGw4OHwfkTL8V.jpg", "actors": ["Earl Burtnett ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
