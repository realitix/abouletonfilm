Profoundly rooted in both traditional and contemporary Japanese culture, Butoh arose in a spirit of revolt in the early 1960s. Characterized by frank sexuality and bodily distortions, Butoh transforms traditional dance movements into new forms, stripping away the taboos of contemporary Japanese culture to reveal a secret world of darkness and irrationality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dmsiS8zPTePnnYtIt4seGsUnZdo.jpg", "actors": ["Tatsumi Hijikata (Himself)", "Kazuo Ohno (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
