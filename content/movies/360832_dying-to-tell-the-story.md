We follow narrator Amy Eldon on a personal journey to find meaning in the death of her older brother, 22-year-old Reuters photographer Dan Eldon. Dan was among a group of five journalists attacked by a mob during the Somali famine in 1993; he and three others were stoned to death. As she interviews other journalists and the sole surviving witness to Dan's death, we see her attain the peace she sought.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8N1VAyczEBBX5TxJwEfDYiNFGZG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
