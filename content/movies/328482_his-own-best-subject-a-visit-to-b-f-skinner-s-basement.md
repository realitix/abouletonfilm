Skinner applied his unique behavioral principles to his own life. In this film, his daughter, Julie Vargas, gives us a tour of the basement study in which he wrote many of his books and articles. Skinner developed wonderfully ingenious gadgets designed to enhance his workspace, and he created clever ways of organizing the writing that was the central focus of the SKINNER WITH PIGEONS last decades of his life.
