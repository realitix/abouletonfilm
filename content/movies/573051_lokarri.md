Imanol is a 20-year-old jai alai player who is sick of the provincial town in which he has grown up, somewhere in France's Basque country. While he dreams of winning a lucrative contract with a professional jai alai team in the United States, he parties around town slowly wrecking his health and his reputation as a reliable player. When Imanol's life seems at its darkest moment, he meets two people who will change his outlook on the world. One of these is Ximista, a legendary jai alai player who went to play in the United States only to return a broken man. The other is Viviane, a Parisian sociology student who falls in love with Imanol and helps him to see the importance of his Basque heritage.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
