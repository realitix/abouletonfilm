When his act provokes a knuckle sandwich one night, the sensible, idealistic and much younger Thea (Janel Moloney) picks him up. Although the two have nothing in common, that doesn't stop them from falling in love. Romance is rough, however, when opposites attract in this thoughtful romantic comedy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c0bpO1IzWHMecojuZwCw4UsbpVx.jpg", "actors": ["Christopher Meloni (Barry Singer)", "Janel Moloney (Thea Douglas)", "Timothy Busfield (Robert Levin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
