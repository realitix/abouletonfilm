Ally (Nina Dobrev) is an optimistic adolescent singer/songwriter whose hard working mother owns the mall music shop frequented by every teen in town. When Ally shares her music with Joey (Rob Mayes), a janitor in the mall who harbors rock star ambitions, she is thrilled to find someone who can truly relate to her songs as well as her heart. Trouble looms on the horizon, however, in the form of the mall owner's spoiled rotten daughter Madison (Autumn Reeser). Madison is the kind of girl who's used to getting whatever she wants, and what she wants now could prove disastrous for both Ally's ambitions, and her mother's popular music store.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pGWEHiroa3F4ySFnbzaOGUztMcr.jpg", "actors": ["Nina Dobrev (Ally)", "Autumn Reeser (Madison Huxley)", "Al Sapienza (Max)", "Brooke Lyons (Dori)", "Yassmin Alers (Erin)", "Rob Mayes (Joey)", "Bresha Webb (Penny)", "Bianca Collins (Mia)", "Kellie Cockrell (Principal Dancer)", "Katie Cockrell (Principal Dancer)", "Blythe Auffarth (Alexa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [18247, 71886, 16173, 35059], "youtube_key": "P9_oBrQKup4"}
