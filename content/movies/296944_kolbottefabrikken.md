She's convinced that she can give her fellow patients more quality of life with clairvoyance, hypnosis and coffee readings than strong medication can. Her new methods quickly spread joy on the ward, but the medication-happy Dr. Bergstroem refuses to surrender to Acacia's strange, new-age methods. According to him she is very ill and the only solution is heavy medication.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pwzpQCtqjBvraoQxswSJoyQFPks.jpg", "actors": ["Mads Koudal (Forsvarer)", "Paprika Steen (Acacia)", "Ole Boisen (Dr. Bergstr\u00f8m, overl\u00e6ge)", "Mia Lyhne (Anette, oversygeplejerske)", "Zlatko Buri\u0107 (Omar)", "Mick \u00d8gendahl (Michael)", "Allan Hyde (Frank, medicinstuderende)", "Jesper Asholt (Dr. Selmer, retsl\u00e6ge)", "Lars Bjarke (Klient)", "Jens Andersen (Anklager)", "Simon Jul J\u00f8rgensen (Hasse, patient)", "Vigga Bro (Dommer)", "Anders Petersen ()", "Maria Vidya Christensen ()", "Katrine Weigelt Nielsen ()", "Bente Skipper ()", "Mads Jarl Koefoed ()", "Sarah-Sita Lassen ()", "Michael Kronborg Nielsen ()", "Maiken P.
