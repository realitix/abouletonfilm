They have little physical evidence - their main source, Frank Serpico, won't wear a wire. They finally strike gold when a corrupt cop named William Phillips agrees to become their undercover agent, in exchange for immunity from a bribery charge. The evidence he eventually collects leads directly to the indictment of thirty New York cops. But the tables quickly turn when Phillips himself is convicted of a double-homicide. Three decades later and still in prison Phillips claims he's the victim of a massive police conspiracy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tGlP24sUwrmgoPAMby683nrr8SO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
