Personal relationships with his son Patrick have been strained as a result. The only ones who ever knew anything about it were his deceased wife and his best friend, Thurgood who he works with, who both agreed to help keep it covered up for him as long as they could. However, when his treasured grandson begins experiencing the same problems, Mike realizes that he can't hide his secret any longer, or if he tried to, it would be most difficult. Even more so when he is endorsed and volunteers to run as a candidate for local election.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/78aMsKIQrQJVfDsk5rf9zcRJSzj.jpg", "actors": ["Kirk Douglas (Grandpa Mike Dunmore)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
