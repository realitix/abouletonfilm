Chimera_... I mean... Come on... There was no way we weren't going to watch that.\r\n\r\nYeah, it's bad. Fantasy setting, if you were wondering. The Pegasus doesn't have wings for 99% of the movie and the Chimera is in no way chimeric and they also spend essentially no time versing one another, but go off I guess?\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
