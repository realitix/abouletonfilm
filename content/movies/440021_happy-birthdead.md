Would personally recommend you give it a go._"}, {"pseudo": "tmdb44006625", "content": "Happy Death Day is surprisingly great fun. It doesn't have a reason to exist other than to tell a slasher film in the Groundhog Day formula, but it's funny when it wants to be, creepy when it wants to be, and Jessica Rothe has got great screen presence. The film could have benefitted from more creative kills (and an R rating), but for a one or two time watch, Happy Death Day is sure to entertain."}], "recommandations_id": [460019, 298250, 396422, 419479]}
