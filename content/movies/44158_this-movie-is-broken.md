But tomorrow she's off for school in France, and maybe she only granted this miracle as a parting gift for her long time friend. So tonight is Bruno's last chance. And tonight, as it happens, Broken Social Scene, her favourite band, is throwing a big outdoor bash. Maybe if Bruno, with the help of his best pal Blake, can score tickets and give Caroline a night to remember, he can keep this miracle alive.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8uiVS35J6uxiYuNNpMUdJuymTjL.jpg", "actors": ["Greg Calderone (Bruno)", "Georgina Reilly (Caroline)", "Lyndie Greenwood (Blake's Girlfriend)", "Kjartan Hewitt (Blake)", "Mayko Nguyen (Publicist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [49004], "youtube_key": "BinLJtzirXc"}
