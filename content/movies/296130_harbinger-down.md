When the ship's crew dredges up a recently thawed piece of old Soviet space wreckage, things get downright deadly. It seems that the Russians experimented with tardigrades, tiny resilient animals able to withstand the extremes of space radiation. The creatures survived, but not without mutation. Now the crew is exposed to aggressively mutating organisms. And after being locked in ice for 3 decades, the creatures aren't about to give up the warmth of human companionship.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2MoMVCLliM9sVjiXiuWHpl63h3D.jpg", "actors": ["Lance Henriksen (Graff)", "Matt Winston (Stephen)", "Camille Balsamo (Sadie)", "Giovonnie Samuels (Ronelle)", "Winston James Francis (Big G)", "Mick Ignis (Tardigrade)", "Milla Bjorn (Svet)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [356483, 323366, 14458, 210913], "youtube_key": "KjiCQgiM7-I"}
