Despite her age, however, she got involved with the resistance. When she was arrested for the first time, her rich father managed to set her free, and she fell in love with a young doctor who took care of her injuries following torture. A little before the withdrawal of the Germans, she participated in the blowing up of a train that was transporting ammunition, and she was arrested again, but this time no one could save her. She was executed at the Cha\u00efdari camp, along with forty-nine other prisoners.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3SSvIzh6rbgVMkCeuEBTAT28hwu.jpg", "actors": ["Mary Vidali (Iro Konstadopoulou)", "Nikos Apergis (Fotis)", "Gelly Mavropoulou (Eleni Konstadopoulou)", "Olga Politou (Lela Karagianni)", "Hristos Nomikos (SS Collaborator)", "Nikos Papahristos (Mr.Konstadopoulos)", "George Foundas (Notis)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
