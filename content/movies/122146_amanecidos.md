Five girls and five boys at the height of youth, when the distance is starting to make out adult life. Pieces of life captured in short sequences in different scenarios, and not follow any narrative structure. Amanecidos are the pages of a diary or a photo album open to chance. These are memories that come to mind without warning. A story that beats as strongly as its young protagonists.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5JY2S7cDhH3dDlHX93fzWNyC3Es.jpg", "actors": ["Brais Abad ()", "David Arnans ()", "Maggie Civantos ()", "Maria Cuesta ()", "Cecilia De La Torre ()", "Laura de la Isla (Paula)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "MrlmKzZcqvc"}
