Reminiscent of today's popular reality-based cop shows, White Homeland Commando offers a straightforward story: four members of a special police unit investigate and infiltrate a New York-based white supremacist organization. But that is where the commonplace ends. The teleplay is shot and edited in a highly textured visual style, the colors are subdued yet somehow garish, and the sound is deliberately just out of sync with the speaker's lips. Occasional static combines with jumps in the plot \u2014 the editing is reminiscent of a television viewer flipping channels.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jlAdsCRsFs1Ez9muE44IwyTxB1n.jpg", "actors": ["Ron Vawter ()", "Kate Valk ()", "Peyton Alex Smith ()", "Nancy Reilly ()", "Anna K\u00f6hler ()", "Michael Stumm ()", "Willem Dafoe ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [424853, 457232], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
