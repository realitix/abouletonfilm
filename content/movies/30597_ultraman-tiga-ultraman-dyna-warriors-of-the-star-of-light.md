The crew of the ship claim to members of the world peace force that originally created the Super GUTS force, and they invite the GUTS members to enter their brainwave patterns into the ship's battle computer so it can be a more effective fighting system. It sounds like a good idea, but could they have some other plan up their sleeves?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i60jgBf5ZLCCyhI0FJ0GtuTeSJ.jpg", "actors": ["Takeshi Yoshioka (Gamu Takayama / Ultraman Gaia)", "Gaku Hamada (Tsutomu)", "Mai Saito (Risa)", "Sei Hiraizumi (Chiba)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [113094, 215402, 301514], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
