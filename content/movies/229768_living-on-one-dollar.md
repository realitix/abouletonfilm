Four young friends set out to research and live this reality. Armed with only a video camera and a desire to understand, they spend just 56 dollars each for 56 days in rural Pena Blanca, Guatemala. They battle E.Coli, financial stress, and the realization that there are no easy answers. Yet, the generosity and strength of their neighbors, Rosa, Anthony and Chino gives them resilient hope. They return home transformed and embark on a mission to share their new found understanding with other students, inspiring and challenging their generation to make a difference.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1w9MQn2itNBaWPZdtsDHIYmo6l6.jpg", "actors": ["Chris Temple (Himself)", "Ryan Christoffersen (Himself)", "Zach Ingrasci (Himself)", "Sean Leonard (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [336992, 381287, 360284, 53455], "youtube_key": "Ze72rpWp_Dg"}
