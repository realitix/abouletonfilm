Using twenty-four positions the film was shot over the course of an entire day, with one shot per hour. The camera moves continuously and almost imperceptibly, covering the surrounding area while the landmark remains centered in the frame. Today the building, a former indoor swimming pool, serves as a venue for various events; from right wing party gatherings to an erotic fair that presents a live show with lights visible even from the outside of the pyramid. In filming the building, a structural approach focused on geometry was used in order to achieve less subjectively motivated images.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tQgt0jfgYNc6DJNBqyEC5O6Ni0w.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
