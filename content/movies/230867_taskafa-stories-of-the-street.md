John Berger begins Ta\u015fkafa\u2019s story, reading from his novel, King, the story of the disappearance of a community told from a dog\u2019s perspective. The area\u2019s ordinary people \u2013 taxi drivers, shopkeepers, street traders \u2013 care deeply about the welfare of the city\u2019s street dogs and they tell us stories about Ta\u015fkafa and their other canine neighbours. The animals are a symbol of community living, where people (and dogs) look out for each other, but this is a community in transition; one from which dogs are starting to be expelled. Eccentric, amusing and very warm, the film is a powerful indictment of the impact of global politics and the economic appropriation of public space but, even more, it is a tribute to both the spirit of resistance and to city life that can accommodate people and dogs together.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lBLmyycslRhy0XH9ToPoTS0Lw2v.jpg", "actors": ["John Berger (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
