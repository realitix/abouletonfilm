He is Orzechowski, an engineer since 1914. An inquiry immediately follows. Testimony takes the form of flashbacks. Tuszka, the station master, believes Orzechowski was a saboteur; at least one on the inquiry panel agrees. Zapora, the young engineer on the train that hit Orzechowski, gives more complicated testimony about the dead man - stiff-necked, proud, imperious, critical of Zapora and other younger workers. The signalman at the crossing where Orzechowski died also testifies. Can the panel arrive at the truth in a world where workers unite, inferior coal is a badge of honor, and the old order is suspect?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wdW4wX5CxIrguQjekTp68PkcDR0.jpg", "actors": ["Kazimierz Opali\u0144ski (W\u0142adys\u0142aw Orzechowski)", "Zygmunt Maciejewski (Tuszka)", "Zygmunt Zintel (Sa\u0142ata)", "Zygmunt Listkiewicz (Stanis\u0142aw Zapora)", "Roman K\u0142osowski (Marek Nowak)", "Kazimierz Fabisiak ()", "Ludos\u0142aw Koz\u0142owski ()", "Janusz Bylczy\u0144ski ()", "Stanis\u0142aw Marecki ((w napisach: Stanis\u0142aw Marzec-Marecki))", "J\u00f3zef Para ()", "Stanis\u0142aw Jaworski ()", "Celina Klimczak ((w napisach: Alina Klimczak))", "Natalia Szyma\u0144ska ()", "J\u00f3zef Nowak ()", "Janusz Paluszkiewicz ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [109364, 211021, 387646, 454523], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
