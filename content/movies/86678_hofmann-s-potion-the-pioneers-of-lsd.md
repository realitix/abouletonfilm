This documentary is a fascinating look at the story of \"acid\" before it hit the streets.  Featuring interviews with many LSD pioneers, Hofmann's Potion is much more than a simple chronicle of the drug's early days. With thoughtful interviews, beautiful music and stunning cinematography, it is an invitation to look at LSD, and our world, with a more open, compassionate mind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jm4KzxMkGlixBXFcxmiOXVh11D3.jpg", "actors": ["Stanislav Grof (himself)", "Albert Hofmann (himself)", "Humphry Osmond (himself)", "Ram Dass (himself)", "Duncan Blewett (himself)", "Abram Hoffer (himself)", "Alfred M.
