This is not a pro-Nazi pro-anything movie. It's a very (VERY) long documentary about the entire history of Adolf Hitler, as neutral as it can be without any assumptions or pre-concieved ideas.\r\n\r\nWatch it - it presents what Germany was, what Hitler accomplished and what the whole thing really was about - free of Hollywood and Jewish propaganda.\r\n\r\nYou know what they say: 'History is written by the victors.' - Well, you have a chance to see history as it was - without it being influenced by the 'victors'. Take it."}], "recommandations_id": [38668, 39266]}
