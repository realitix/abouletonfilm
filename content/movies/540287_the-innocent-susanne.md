In Paris, she meets Ren\u00e9 and begins to recruit him, but she has a noble competitor: Jacqueline. A spirited love triangle begins, complicated by the interventions of uncomprehending moral preachers. Their befitting final finds the story in the Moulin Rouge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hCoEn31JWsIlkFuWhslzUBs0j1E.jpg", "actors": ["Ruth Weyher (Susanne)", "Willy Fritsch (Ren\u00e9 Boislurette)", "Lilian Harvey (Jacqueline)", "Hans Junkermann (Baron Aubrais)", "Lydia Potechina (Baronin Aubrais)", "Otto Wallburg (Charency)", "Sascha Bragowa (Charencys Frau Rose)", "Ernst Hofmann (Henry, Ren\u00e9s Freund)", "Werner Fuetterer (Hubert)", "Hans Wassmann (Dr. med.
