Ghanaian Video Tales helps bring up information on the beginnings of the 80s video boom, and the producers and directors who helped make it happen and their involvement in film through 2001. Ghanaian Video Tales is most interested in the horror films coming out of Ghana, the interviews and clips are all geared in that direction. The influence of the church is mentioned, but as far as anyone who watches this knows, every film that comes out of Ghana is a horror film. We know that isn\u2019t true, so there are still stories to be told.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/owVmAEEDXNUzCCJHoABGvsH2HOy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
