His ideas and propositions, expressed not only in texts but also in statements and interviews, revolutionized art and culture, transforming him into one of the most important Brazilian artists of the 20th century. Foregoing voiceover narration and expert analyses, the film allows Oiticica himself to narrate his life and expound upon his art in his own words, and in extremely rare archival audio and visual material.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qUahiqz20YzCyqL8zJgGxVVUEXO.jpg", "actors": ["H\u00e9lio Oiticica (Narrator (archive footage))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "wPN7trFjE5M"}
