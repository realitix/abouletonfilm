This comedy had me rolling almost from start to finish... some highly questionable scenes, I wouldn't recommend it for families with young children, but older teens will find it amusing I am sure. Interesting Plot, likable characters, and plenty of mishaps to make it just the right amount of humorous. I actually wouldn't mind if they tried to do a follow-up story to this... but only if they could get the same cast to star in it."}], "recommandations_id": [51540, 195589, 227159, 52449], "youtube_key": "O7NHfAzg7Yg"}
