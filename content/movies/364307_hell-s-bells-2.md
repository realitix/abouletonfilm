Far more than just an expose on the \"evils of rock-n-roll\", this powerful eight-part series uncovers the \"war of the worldviews\" - the epic struggle between good and evil, sin and redemption for the souls of men and the destiny of culture.  Covering a wide range of styles over almost a century of music, Hell's Bells 2 looks at hundreds of artists, videos, ideas and issues as it takes the viewer on a journey into the \"soul of rock-n-roll\". Fresh, vibrant, and wonderfully compelling, this is one documentary series that can illuminate as well as educate - change hearts as well as minds!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oB46XghxA7S8mzCM5ZBSpa6e0UX.jpg", "actors": ["Eric Holmberg ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
