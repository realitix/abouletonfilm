During his rite of passage, he's determined to tame a painted pony. He approaches manhood while his peaceful clan is set upon by a nearby tribe willing to break a treaty. He must also contend with the kidnapping of three young women from his village, his pony's illness behind enemy lines, his mother's coma after a rattlesnake bite, the medicine man's urging that he sacrifice what he loves best, the attack of a cougar and of wolves, and his own injury while alone in the woods. His kindness, bravery, and quick thinking serve him well, but rescue come from an unexpected source.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3lFZ7AH8jIWJHvJuRwHmKdQdlzP.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Crawford (Nishko)", "Jay Silverheels (Chief Hevatanu)", "Pat Hogan (Sutamakis)", "George J.
