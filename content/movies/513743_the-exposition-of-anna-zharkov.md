The film is situated in a sanatorium where Anna\u2019s dreams and memories are juxtaposed with events at Anna\u2019s home, where she has two children. In the meantime, a special yet doomed relationship develops in the clinic between the young women and Leonore, one of the nurses. Much of the film was re-shot a second time from a monitor, for which the director developed a special camera. In addition, van Houten thought of a way to filter the images of Anna\u2019s memories and re-scanned them to make the newly created images reminiscent of paintings.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
