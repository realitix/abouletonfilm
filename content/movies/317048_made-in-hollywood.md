Quoting from a catalogue of popular styles and sources, from TV commercials to The Wizard of Oz, the Yonemotos construct a parable of the Hollywood image-making industry from a pastiche of narrative cliches: A small-town ingenue goes West to find her dream and loses her innocence; the patriarch of a Hollywood studio nears death; a New York couple seeks screenwriting fame and fortune in the movies. With deadpan humor and hyperbolic visual stylization, the Yonemotos layer artifice upon artifice, constructing an image-world where reality and representation, truth and simulation, are meaningless distinctions.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Patricia Arquette (Tammy)", "Michael Lerner (Irving)", "Ron Vawter (Matt)", "Mary Woronov (Mary)", "Rachel Rosenthal ()", "Raymond Cruz ()", "Perrey Reeves ()", "Mike Kelley ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
