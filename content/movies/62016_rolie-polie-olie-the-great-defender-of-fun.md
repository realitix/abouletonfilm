Unfortunately for our heroes, an invitation to Zowie Polie's third birthday party accidentally finds its way to Gloomius's ship. Gloomius never had a birthday party himself, so he sets out to make Zowie's as miserable as possible. He tries a glum ray, kidnapping Zowie and Pappy, and ultimately towing the entire Polie Planet to the Gloomy Galaxy. Between Olie's Super Silly Ray (his present to Zowie) and some help from Saturday morning hero Space Boy the day is saved for silliness. The whole planet helps charge up the Super Silly Ray and fix Gloomius's happy gear.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n7FI4cXq280cSQzBzx33uysSJT8.jpg", "actors": ["James Woods (Gloomius Maximus)", "Kyle Fairlie (Spaceboy, Young Dad)", "Cole Caplan (Olie)", "Noah Reid (Screwy)", "Adrian Truss (Dad, Gizmo)", "Catherine Disher (Mom, TV Journalist)", "Kristen Bone (Zowie)", "Joshua Tucci (Billy Bevel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
