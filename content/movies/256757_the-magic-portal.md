It was shot on a bolex 19mm camera using 16 mm film and features animated LEGO, plasticine, and cardboard characters and objects, mixing both stop motion animation and live action.\r\n\r\nPortal had high production values for a brickfilm, with a five-figure budget granted by the Australian Film Commission. However, due to legal issues with The LEGO Group, it did not see a wide release.\r\n\r\nIts first major exposure was on the SBS \"Eat Carpet\" program that showcased short film in the early 1990's-2000's, where it was shown 6 times over the years."}], "recommandations_id": []}
