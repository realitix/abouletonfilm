However, due to legal issues with The LEGO Group, it did not see a wide release.\r\n\r\nIts first major exposure was on the SBS \"Eat Carpet\" program that showcased short film in the early 1990's-2000's, where it was shown 6 times over the years."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "jde4qHbCtSg"}
