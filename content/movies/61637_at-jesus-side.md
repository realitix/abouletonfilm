Our hero, Jericho, is a vagabond street dog who befriends Jesus and follows him throughout the week. Jericho hates humans, so when Jesus is kind to him, it\u2019s the biggest surprise of his life. We see him turn from fear and anger to love and grace when he learns how to forgive a man who hurt him in the past. After Jesus\u2019 arrest at Gethsemane, Jericho rallies an epic charge of animal friends to try to save Jesus from his fate. Jericho\u2019s grief at the Crucifixion becomes joyous celebration at witnessing the Resurrection, the greatest miracle of the Christian faith. No one was there to see it. So of course, the story has never been told.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9vyMkEndd4WqRuPoGywL8xUgZuw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
