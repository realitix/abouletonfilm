Shot in real environments and situations, the core group of players improvise based on semi-scripted scenes. Because many of these performers are legendary in the downtown scene in  NYC, they are archetypes playing archetypes. As the players move in and out of fictionalized characters and real life -- the film moves in and out of non-linear narrative and historical document.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iOv7bWANsjoaTjaKeVO9A7QHdxA.jpg", "actors": ["Kathleen Hanna ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
