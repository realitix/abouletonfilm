In 17th century Finland, the young Arvid is forced to marry the little Brita but their ways soon part when their respective fathers move to different places. Years roll by and Arvid (now played by Olavi Reimas) grows up into a handsome and respected Thirty Years' War veteran known for his excellent fencing skills. However, he has fallen madly in love with a local maiden who does not reciprocate his advances, not to mention that his forced marriage to Brita (Sirkka Sari) is still valid. With his new practically-minded servant Kustaa (Vilho Auvinen) and a romance-hungry woman Johanna (Kerttu Salmi), Arvid travels to meet Brita in order to get a divorce but love has other plans for the originally reluctant couple.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2JiqejyQcEyaGzgB4c2Sl3HozDO.jpg", "actors": ["Olavi Reimas (Arvid Henrikinpoika Tandefelt)", "Sirkka Sari (Brita Ekestubbe)", "Vilho Auvinen (Haavuri-Kustaa)", "Kerttu Salmi (Johanna)", "Uuno Laakso (Erik Stjernh\u00f6k)", "Uuno Laakso (Axel Ringius)", "Topo Leistel\u00e4 (Henrik Laurinpoika Ekestubbe)", "Paavo J\u00e4nnes (Brita's father)", "Tuulikki Schreck (Brita as a child)", "Kalevi Koski (Arvid as a child)", "Iivari Kainulainen (Vicar)", "Ida Salmi (Vicar's wife)", "Verna Piponius (Merchant's wife)", "Kosti Aaltonen (Merchant)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
