They stick out in a proverbial societal sea of many smaller fish. Similar to whales, these girls eat uncontrollably, and pack on kilo after kilo of blubber to keep them warm and happy year round. Similar to their oceanic sisters, Japanese female whales are in short supply, yet in very high demand. Mating season is year round, yet it has taken Third World Media quite some time to harpoon, reel in, and impregnate these blubber bangers in a futile attempt to preserve the species and present them to you.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nLswWGUs7CmzdWO2IyEr9Lq1Vhg.jpg", "actors": ["Mu Minazuki ()", "Mirai Kuroki ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
