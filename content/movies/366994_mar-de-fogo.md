In 2014, Joel Pizzini paid homage to the film, and in particular its filmmaker, by creating a film montage using images from Limite and additional documentary material of interviews from the 1970s and 1980s. Mario Peixoto never finished another film, even though he continued to work on diverse projects. Mar de Fogo also features a freely imagined new sequence for Peixoto\u2019s next, but never completed film as envisaged by Joel Pizzini. He tries to invoke Peixoto\u2019s vision while making Limite and to visually explore the feeling he had when he had the inspiration for the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4GIO8YBoWc8BbsveoDnJvw6u09Z.jpg", "actors": ["M\u00e1rio Peixoto (Ele mesmo (arquivo))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
