A piercing musical score loops endlessly throughout, and the repetitive and curious iterations of movement become furtive searches for meaning within their own blandness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yr32glsvLEnFQCKVrgb7aSyfBQk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
