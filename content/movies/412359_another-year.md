The film portrays a series of random occurrences. Joys, frustrations and the struggle for survival. The meals unfold in real-time through thirteen static, long takes. Each take captures with vivid detail the reality of the relationships between the different family members. As the seasons unfold, so does time and the echoes for better working conditions penetrate the frame. Issues such as the one-child-policy and the possibilities for better wages weigh heavily on the minds of the three-generation family.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1chvAN3Rtu6xtBqZazWaEi0s8QD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
