Each bouquet of flowers is also a bouquet of frames mingling the plants to be found in a given place with the activities that happen to be there at the time. Lowder uses the film strip as a canvas with the freedom to film frames on any part of the strip in any order, running the film through the camera as many times as needed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hiyZZMYW29n2EXX9tXqkvPAIJml.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [216110, 90823, 410076, 117591], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
