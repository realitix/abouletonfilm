The voice acting is very fluid and the animation is timeless. The movie makes me wish I were able to see the father of America at his best which is something a movie rarely does to me. For such a short film, it had so much packed into it and it didn't feel rushed even though they fast forwarded quite a few times through the revolutionary war.\r\n\r\n VERDICT:\r\n\r\nI loved almost everything about this film. George Washington's actions were portrayed beautifully and the supporting cast did an excellent job as well. The only flaws I would give this film is that some of the events were sometimes heavily inaccurate. It also seemed like the characters, particularly Washington(who was written to constantly shoot out patriotic speeches to make him seem like he was the perfect American guy), were over-acting a little,  Nonetheless, it's a tear-jerker (if that's what you like) and it's emotional.\r\nScore: 9/10."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "jxKWiGS_3R8"}
