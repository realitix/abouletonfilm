Then, oddly, people behave as if the picture is amazingly important. Later, it seems that this childish scrawl is somehow a map of the mythical city of El Dorado and people are willing to kill to get it. Eventually, a group of colonists use it to dig and dig for this treasure--only to end up blowing themselves up. Then, the natives all celebrate and live happily ever after.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cXiSvYe0vReaMxX70t3PTRtGive.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
