Don Henrico banishes his daughter, Josephe, to a convent when he learns she loves Jeronimo, a mestizo who's a teacher in the household. The lovers meet in secret, a child is born, the pair are condemned to die, and prelates scheme to seize Don Henrico's fortune. A moment before Josephe's public execution, an earthquake devastates Santiago. Josephe finds her baby and flees the rubble; Jeronimo survives, escapes, and finds her. The reunion brings joy and rebirth. He wants to build a Utopian community, without priests. She believes they can reenter Santiago society, forgiven. Class, race, and religion dictate a world order: is there a place for these lovers?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vKRbBUOkxWqNfbu6rSv1ryNZFHD.jpg", "actors": ["Julia Pe\u00f1a (Josephe)", "Magdalena Kerr (Josephe (voice))", "V\u00edctor Alc\u00e1zar (Jeronimo)", "Fred Maire (Jeronimo (voice))", "Fernando Villena (Don Henrico Asteron)", "Wolf Ackva (Don Henrico Asteron (voice))", "Juan Amigo (Don Fernando Ormez)", "Manfred Schott (Don Fernando Ormez (voice))", "\u00c1ngel \u00c1lvarez (Bishop)", "Eric Jelde (Bishop (voice))", "Jos\u00e9 Villasante (Secretary)", "Alois Maria Giani (Secretary (voice))", "Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Hoyos (Dona Elvira Ormez)", "Lis Kertelge (Dona Elvira Ormez (voice))", "Mar\u00eda Vico (Dona Elisabeth Ormez)", "Helga Tr\u00fcmper (Dona Elisabeth Ormez (voice))", "Raquel Rodrigo (Wife of Pedrillo the Shoemaker)", "Marianne Wischmann (Wife of Pedrillo the Shoemaker (voice))", "Antonio Gamero (Pedrillo the Shoemaker)", "Bruno W.
