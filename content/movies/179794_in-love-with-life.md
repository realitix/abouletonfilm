He meets a young boy, Laury and his mother, Sharon in the park and is quite taken with them. He gets a job-prospect letter, as a private tutor, and applies at once. His employer is Mr. Morley, a surly, sour, mean-tempered old man who informs John he is to act as a tutor for his grandson, who turns out to be Laury. Sharon, Morleys daughter had eloped against her father's wishes and was abandoned by her husband after Laury's birth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yHKlUtVSIfNsUrXKac5e5dEeQXV.jpg", "actors": ["Lila Lee (Sharon)", "Dickie Moore (Laurence 'Laury' Applegate)", "Onslow Stevens (Prof. John Applegate)", "Claude Gillingwater (Morley)", "Rosita Marstini (Brouquet)", "James T.
