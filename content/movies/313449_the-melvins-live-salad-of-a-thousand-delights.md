Bandmembers Buzz, Dale and Joe jam through 12 heavy-duty cuts (including \"Antioxidote\" and \"Euthenasia\") as their die-hard audience goes crazy. Includes a bonus shorter set from Seattle in 1991, as well as a very early 1984 live-in-the-studio track.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yAySvWrpPgI0Iq1z91M5Snt1eyL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
