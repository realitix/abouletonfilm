For LGBT Christians, who had been rejected by the Christian community for a long time, they finally have a church that offers them a safe haven. Though the founder has passed away, the church members continue to make their voice heard, confronting the unjust social institutions while struggling with religious conflict at the same time. Come hell or high water, they strive to make a difference in the lives of others by telling their own life stories, in hope that love will eventually trump hate and solve misunderstanding someday.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aAkqJzASAiSfJAfxYXqAJGL4j78.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
