Best friends Mees and Boelie are spending a beautiful spring day in Amsterdam's Vondelpark. It seems like just a normal day, until they meet the young and attractive Panda. While the heat rises in the park, it's nowhere to be found between the long-married couple Etta and Ernst-Jan. Ernst-Jan suspects Etta of cheating and has his own ideas of how to catch her in the act. We also meet Rosa and Kees, old lovers whose paths cross after decades of not seeing each other. On this spring day in Amsterdam, their love starts blooming again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tDSnVnM0aza3dGm4qbyhZlxaUEk.jpg", "actors": ["Reinout Scholten van Aschat (Mees)", "G\u00e9za Weisz (Boelie)", "Willeke van Ammelrooy (Rosa Overbeek)", "Anniek  Pheifer (Etta)", "Stefan de Walle (Kees Bakels)", "Romy Lauwers (Panda)", "Teun Kuilboer (Ernst-Jan)", "Nick Golterman (Wim)", "Tine Joustra (Mother Mees)", "Elsie de Brauw (Mother Boelie)", "Jim Deddes (Flip)", "Hugo Haenen (Father Mees)", "July Janssen (Steffie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "esw3IYzCBr8"}
