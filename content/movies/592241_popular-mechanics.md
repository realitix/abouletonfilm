A steamy lather shower gets things started, featuring Kyle Carrington and Paul Barresi. Come with Kyle on his first day of work with hands on training by John Von Crouche. Watch as Shawn Michaels goes to a customer's house, Jamie Wingo, and picks up more than the car. In the middle of the action, the gas attendant, Jeff Holden, decides to join in from his window vantage point. Customers and mechanics alike get checked out when Eric Martinez comes to check on the body work being done on his car and mechanic Scott Avery works over his body. The final scene brings together five of these hot mechanics at the garage owner's home. They go there to take the afternoon off, but end up all just getting off.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/YHIrzjW1GSu3hYfn7HUqchAuZv.jpg", "actors": ["Kyle Carrington ()", "Mark Jennings ()", "John Von Crouche ()", "Shawn Michaels ()", "Scott Avery ()", "Jamie Wingo ()", "Paul Barresi ()", "Ron Chambers ()", "Tony James ()", "Joe Savage ()", "David Leslie ()", "Russ Starchild ()", "Christopher James ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
