He and his partner Janel dedicated every moment, ounce of energy, and dollar to making their \u201cScream Park\u201d a reality. \u201cMonsters Wanted\u201d is the story of their self-proclaimed madness and the industry, culture, and people who share it.  We followed Rich and Janel\u2019s efforts from the first day of building beyond the last day of the season. The result is a one-of-a-kind peek into an industry known for its macabre antics and well guarded secrets.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dip1pIY7eIEEOaDKDuC7q9DHm8S.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Teachout (Richard Teachout)", "Janel Nash (Janel Nash)", "Kenneth Schell (Kenneth Schell)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "MLuF4nCwFrM"}
