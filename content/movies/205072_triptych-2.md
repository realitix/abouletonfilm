It was a double performance where parts engraved directly on \u00b1\r 16mm black film are inserted on a background made with the help of a live mixing software. The film is based, on the one hand, on a process of condensation and densification of the original footage of the performance that serves as a departure for interventions that intensify its energetic potentialities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mIwHHmbp2YJ8lZhbPjJpl0n2EF5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
