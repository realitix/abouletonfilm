The video blends edited footage from the 1975 show with music from the group's \"Ricochet\" album released that same year. The concert is notable in part because German aircraft bombed and partially destroyed the cathedral during the Coventry Blitz of World War II.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lfkQK2l4vS0WhdCSJmnmEZVtySd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
