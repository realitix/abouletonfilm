It's that time of yeah when the grandstands rise above the scenery and ten thousand JDM fans fight their way through the gates to experience the infamous D1 night battle session.  It's ALIVE!! Kumakubo's 500hp FR Impreza produced by JUN Auto received its first breath of life. How will JUN's extensive tuning knowledge affect it's first attempt at a drift machine? Orido's remastered RS8R Supra also makes its appearance after mending it's wounds from the first battle!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/21iNPwrUa8nfDYIKvAnNLNHV82D.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
