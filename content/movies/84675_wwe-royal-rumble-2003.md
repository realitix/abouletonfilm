It was presented by PlayStation and took place on January 19, 2003 at the Fleet Center in Boston, Massachusetts. As has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a match at that year's WrestleMania, for his choice at either the WWE Championship or the World Heavyweight Championship.  Six professional wrestling matches were featured at the event. The main event was the annual 30-man Royal Rumble match, which featured wrestlers from both brands. The primary match on the Raw brand was Triple H versus Scott Steiner for the World Heavyweight Championship. The predominant match on the SmackDown! brand was between Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit for the WWE Championship. The featured match on the undercard was a Royal Rumble qualification match between Brock Lesnar and The Big Show.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iOfWMLSzbCAW1bimFhAiB5P5j8M.jpg", "actors": ["Kurt Angle (Kurt Angle)", "Chris Benoit (Chris Benoit)", "Paul Michael L\u00e9vesque (Triple H)", "Scott Carl Rechsteiner (Scott Steiner)", "Mark William Calaway (The Undertaker)", "Brock Lesnar (Himself)", "Ric Flair (Himself)", "Torrie Wilson (Herself)", "Dawn Marie Psaltis (Herself)", "Mark LoMonaco (Bubba Ray Dudley)", "Devon Hughes (D-Von Dudley)", "Darren Matthews (William Regal)", "Lance Evers (Lance Storm)", "Paul Wight (Big Show)", "Paul Heyman (Himself)", "Michael Shawn Hickenbottom (Himself)", "Chris Jericho (Chris Jericho)", "Oscar Gutierrez Rubio (Rey Mysterio)", "Adam Copeland (Edge)", "William Jason Reso (Christian)", "Chavo Guerrero (Himself)", "Yoshihiro Tajiri (Tajiri)", "Thomas James Laughlin (Tommy Dreamer)", "Barry Buchanan (B-2)", "Rob Van Dam (Himself)", "Glenn Thomas Jacobs (Kane)", "Matt Hardy (Himself)", "Eddie Guerrero (Himself)", "Jeffrey Nero Hardy (Himself)", "Matt Anoai (Rosey)", "Andrew Martin (Test)", "John Cena (Himself)", "Solofa Fatu Jr. (Rikishi)", "Edward Fatu (Jamal)", "Booker Huffman (Booker T)", "Maven Huffman (Himself)", "Matt Bloom (A-Train)", "Dustin Runnels (Goldust)", "Dave Bautista (Batista)", "Shelton Benjamin (Himself)", "Charles Doyle Haas II (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [122964, 122963, 58975, 58974], "youtube_key": "54YWAwydWMA"}
