The story is told through the lives of three ordinary and extraordinary American families who changed history by their courageous challenges to the powerful status quo. Descendants of Dred and Harriet Scott and those of Wong Kim Ark tell the stories of how their ancestors fought all the way to the Supreme Court and changed American history. Rosario Lopez and her daughter Vanessa are both activists in the immigrant rights youth movement. It is the citizenship of millions of children like Vanessa Lopez, born in the United States to undocumented parents, that is at stake now.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aTLF9xsGM7YFY9jMHwaOpdveO17.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
