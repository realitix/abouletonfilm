Assigned to the Texas League, he does fine until the championship play-offs when a riot develops over one of his calls. The involved player is knocked unconscious in the proceedings and cannot verify that Bill made the correct call. Despite lynch mob plans to at least tar-and-feather him, Bill's family - his daughters Lucy (Gloria Henry and Susan (Connie Marshall ) and his wife Betty (Una Merkel) - help Bill reach the ballpark safely the next day through a series of hair-raising encounters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1el3nR55ygsW1FFonYqMhlOaOvK.jpg", "actors": ["William Bendix (Bill 'Two Call' Johnson)", "Una Merkel (Betty Johnson)", "Ray Collins (Jonah Evans)", "Gloria Henry (Lucy Johnson)", "Jeff Richards (Bob Landon)", "Connie Marshall (Suzie Johnson)", "William Frawley (Jimmy O'Brien)", "Tom D'Andrea (Roscoe Snooker)", "Alan Hale Jr. (Harry Shea)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
