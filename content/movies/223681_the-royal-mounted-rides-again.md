They played Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers investigating the murder of a miner. The story, of course, was less important than speed and action, which directors Ray Taylor and Lewis D. Collins delivered in typical slap-dash Universal style. Starlet Daun Kennedy did not make much of an impression as the imperiled leading lady, and former star Robert Armstrong (of King Kong fame) was wasted in a subordinate role. Rondo Hatton, a non-actor whose grotesque appearance (caused by acromegaly, the so-called \"Elephant Man\" disease) was tastelessly exploited by Universal in the '40s, appeared as one of the outlaws.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4Q3tSoajLBrHEuyUabBb2kMaDIn.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Kennedy (Corporal J.
