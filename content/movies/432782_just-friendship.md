Filip (Kamil Kula) risks his face and career for the whim of a crazy collector of Jad\u017aka buttons (Aleksandra Doma\u0144ska). The sedate professor (Krzysztof Stelmaszyk) refuses his friend's indecent request (Przemys\u0142aw Bluszcz), but he secretly kidnaps himself in a virtually reckless way. Meanwhile, a close-knit group of friends (Agnieszka Wi\u0119d\u0142ocha, Aleksandra Doma\u0144ska, Maciej Zako\u015bcielny, Piotr Stramowski, and Marcin Perchu\u0107) go to the mountains every year. There they discover a mystery that will change their lives forever. What will they choose? Loyalty or money? Friendship or love? Truth or lie? Own or other luck? Every choice for the heroes of the comedy \"Just friendship\" means trouble. Who will help them? We know: friends. Because friendship, like no other investment, always pays off.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2v13MsDkAK9BM5NqjdSt4azpRMh.jpg", "actors": ["Agnieszka Wi\u0119d\u0142ocha (Julia)", "Maciej Zako\u015bcielny (Grzesiek)", "Magdalena R\u00f3\u017cczka (Ivanka)", "Piotr Stramowski (Kamil)", "Bart\u0142omiej Topa (Patryk)", "Marcin Perchu\u0107 (Marian)", "Aleksandra Doma\u0144ska (Jad\u017aka)", "Krzysztof Stelmaszyk (Szymon)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [154297, 498208, 547491], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
