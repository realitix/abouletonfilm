Christine has invited her sister Lisa to move in with them unaware that she is having an affair with husband Barry. Barry, a police detective, only stays with Christine for her money and is looking a way to rid himself permanently of her. Lisa flirts with Barry under Christine?s nose delighting in the thrill of the possibility of being discovered. They find a secret room in the basement laundry with a heavy, titanium door with a cross and mystical writings, locked by an intricate mechanism. They joke about it but only as a way of coping with the mounting fear that it hides something horrible.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6NkIr8cXMFH0bISlHKHmhFvxcH8.jpg", "actors": ["Ashley Gallo (Christine)", "Gregg Biamonte (Luke)", "Debra Gordon (Edwina)", "Dominic Koulianos (Barry)", "Nick Foot (The Master)", "Karen Fox (Lisa)", "Dirk Hermance (Foster)", "Larry Froehlich (Mayor)", "William Victor Schotten (Detective)", "Leah Winebold (Teenager)", "David Caleris (C.S.I.)", "Gene Caleris (Jerry Worhold)", "Lou O'Neill (Himself)", "Arthur Collins (Hippie)", "Adam Altiero (Dead Guy in Barn)", "Amanda Baker (Police Secretary)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
