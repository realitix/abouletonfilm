RR comes three decades after Benning and Bette Gordon made The United States of America (1975), a cinematic journey along the country\u2019s interstates that is keenly aware \u201cof superhighways and railroad tracks as American public symbols.\u201d A political essay responding to the economic histories of trains as instruments in a culture of hyper-consumption, RR articulates its concern most explicitly when Eisenhower's military-industrial complex speech is heard as a mile long coal train passes through eastern Wyoming. Benning spent two and a half years collecting two hundred and sixteen shots of trains, forty-three of which appear in RR. The locomotives' varying colors, speeds, vectors, and reverberations are charged with visual thrills, romance and a nostalgia heightened by Benning's declaration that this will be his last work in 16mm film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3jmx9YjkzCh5lnorf5EVEMdZuFc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
