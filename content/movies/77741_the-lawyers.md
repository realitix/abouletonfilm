In this function, they, for instance, represented the militant Horst Mahler in court. One thing that united all three of them was their goal to create a new and different republic. They viewed Federal Germany as an oppressor of political freedom and as a vassal of the United States. Today, Schily is a former Federal Minister of the Interior with a firmly conservative stance and Str\u00f6bele is a well-respected member of the left wing of the Green Party in the German parliament while Mahler has again come into conflict with the law because of his extremist right-wing activities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6sB9cBCmQrt2bUmQjTw7Er6zZap.jpg", "actors": ["Horst Mahler (Himself)", "Otto Schily (Himself)", "Hans-Christian Str\u00f6bele (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [6699], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
