In the Fourth and Fifth Centuries BC, the Greeks built an empire that stretched across the Mediterranean from Asia to Spain. They laid the foundations of modern science, politics, warfare and philosophy, and produced some of the most breathtaking art and architecture the world has ever seen. This series, narrated by Liam Neeson, recounts the rise, glory, demise and legacy of the empire that marked the dawn of Western civilization. The story of this astonishing civilization is told through the lives of heroes of ancient Greece. The latest advances in computer and television technology rebuild the Acropolis, recreate the Battle of Marathon and restore the grandeur of the Academy, where Socrates, Plato and Aristotle forged the foundation of Western thought.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wsTf4yk3tui9FTCZtRBX3ymmI6.jpg", "actors": ["Willy Bowman (Themistocles)", "Liam Neeson (Narrator)", "Vernon Dobtcheff (Cleisthenes)", "Vernon Dobtcheff (Pericles)", "Bill Reimbold (Socrates)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
