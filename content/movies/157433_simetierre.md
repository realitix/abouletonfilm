A couple of those additions I was not particularly fondof, one's a massive spoiler so I'll let that slide, but the biggest one I knew going into it, 'cause of the trailers, which is: As much as I appreciate John Lithgow, I really wish they had kept this guy (or an emulation of him, I more mean) on as Jud Crandall.\r\n\r\nUnrelated sidenote, but when I was young (and I found out about _Pet Sematary_ overall through the Ramones song of the same name) my dad always told me that it was called _Pet Sematary_ and not _Pet Cemetary_ because Americans spelt it that way. That guy lied about... Just everything.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"}], "recommandations_id": [458723, 456740, 287947, 424139]}
