While they are making love an ugly old witch appears and is rather troublesome. The Knight commands her to leave, and when he is about to force her away she sits on her broom and rises to the moon. After disappearing she causes various hob-goblins to haunt the pair, the last of them stealing away the lady while the Knight's back is turned. The Knight, frantic with grief, is suddenly confronted by a Fairy, who presents him with a magical sword, and tells him that he can use it to regain the young woman.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h9CRIQ4yv6pwuPylJH60rT06Mj7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
