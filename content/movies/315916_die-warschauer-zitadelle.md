Werner Hinz plays Konrad, an idealistic Polish student who courts disaster for his loved ones through his constant harrangues against Russian impression. When his mother promises the authorities that Konrad will cease his protests, he is honor bound to obey her, no matter what the provocation. Drowning his disappointment in liquor, Konrad falls in love with nightclub singer Anna Sasotska (Viktoria von Ballasko). While he never achieves his political goals, Konrad at least finds happiness romantically. The climax of the film is particularly exciting, even though it is motivated by anti-Russian (and implicitly pro-Nazi) propaganda.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5qnVy7QyGJAyXXyfr2ZYZyjBrHH.jpg", "actors": ["Lucie H\u00f6flich (Frau Welgorska)", "Werner Hinz (Konrad - ihr Sohn)", "Viktoria von Ballasko (Anna Lasotzka)", "Hans Leibelt (General Horn)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
