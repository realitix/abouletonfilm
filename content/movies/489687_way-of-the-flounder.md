The flounder feeds on mussels and small shrimps. Many dangers lurk on the bottom of the sea but the flounder is clever. One day the flounder is caught in a net and pulled up on a trawler. It dies on the deck. The fish is now entering a new phase of its existence. The flounder travels on, though life has come to an end.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yFkeCsGhvuFIIqbp5gNqhkPdAzH.jpg", "actors": ["Mats Lindblom ()", "Elina du Rietz ()", "Jean H\u00e4ckinge ()", "Henrik Sunneteg ()", "Sven \u00c5ke Larsson ()", "Jan Ericsson ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
