The film intertwines these images with excerpts of his oeuvre, thus creating a fluid and cinematic continuum. In his score for Living the Light Jim Jarmusch gives this wide raging scale of life and art an additional musical voice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/okGkEnx6b8XjYuIOzvyY25o3uVu.jpg", "actors": ["Robby M\u00fcller ()", "Wim Wenders ()", "Jim Jarmusch ()", "Lars von Trier ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
