Alan Beckwith (Rod La Rocque) is a war hero who is very much down on his luck. He makes a deal with big-time bootlegger Andrew North (Gustave von Seyffertitz) -- if North will give him a large sum of money, Beckwith will kill himself at the end of a year's time. He is to marry a girl of North's choosing and take out an insurance policy naming her as beneficiary; North will collect from the widow. The plot thickens when Beckwith and Beverly (Marguerite De La Motte), the girl North has him marry, actually fall in love. Beverly's brother, Johnny (Ray Hallor), teams up with Beckwith to steal one of North's cargos of rum. North and his men catch them and things look bad until revenue officers -- called on by Beverly -- show up. The North gang is rounded up and Beckwith looks forward to a long life with his wife.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/of3c991jNxg5mhZ8XuEFVtg36GJ.jpg", "actors": ["Rod La Rocque (Alan Beckwith)", "Marguerite De La Motte (Beverly Vane)", "Ray Hallor (Johnny Vane)", "Gustav von Seyffertitz (Andrew North)", "George Cooper (Squint Scoggins)", "Walter Long (Nick Webb)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
