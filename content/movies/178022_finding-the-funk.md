Starting with Funk's roots in Jazz and the James Brown bands of the '60s we travel to the Bay Area to celebrate Sly &amp; the Family Stone, then to Dayton the birthplace of so many of Funk's originators, then onto Detroit where from the ashes of Motown, P-Funk's Mothership arose, and then to LA where a new crop of musicians are creating their own Funk history. On our journey into Funk, we talk to legends Sly Stone, Bootsy Collins, George Clinton, Nona Hendryx, Maceo Parker, Bernie Worrell, and Steve Arrington and their descendants Mike D, D'Angelo, Sheila E, Shock G and Sade's Stuart Matthewman. Narrated by Ahmir 'Questlove' Thompson of the Roots.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z1xxjp65Fi9UYakzu3olzHsB3WD.jpg", "actors": ["George Clinton ()", "Bootsy Collins ()", "Ahmir-Khalib Thompson ()", "James Brown ()", "Nile Rodgers ()", "Bernie Worrell ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
