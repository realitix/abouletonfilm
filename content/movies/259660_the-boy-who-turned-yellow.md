While he is there he loses his pet mouse and vows to return and find her later. Back in school, he is not very attentive and falls asleep during a lesson about electricity so his teacher sends him home. On the 'tube' there is a sudden flash, and John, the train and all of the passengers turn yellow. With the help of Nick (short for 'Electronic') John learns about electricity, invades the Tower of London and saves his pet mouse ... or was it a dream. This is the Powell &amp; Pressburger touch applied to children's films.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xx9V1wLDKDVKs6CXkda3rBpMszH.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Dightam (John)", "Robert Eddison (Nick)", "Helen Weir (Mrs Saunders)", "Brian Worth (Mr Saunders)", "Esmond Knight (Doctor)", "Laurence Carter (Schoolteacher)", "Patrick McAlinney (Supreme Beefeater)", "Lem Dobbs (Munro)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
