After finding CrossFit in 2009, Froning began a history-making career, finishing second at the CrossFit Games in 2010 and dominating the competition for the next four years.  His four titles, five trips to the podium, 16 event wins, 35 top-five event finishes and 45 top-10 event finishes are all records, and he's revered in the community.  Froning's athletic prowess has been under the microscope for five years, but there's much more to the man from Tennessee than snatches and pull-ups.
