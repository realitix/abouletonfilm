Differing accounts as to the exact details of the man's killing fueled a full-blown NCIS murder investigation. Soon, the seven Marines and one Navy Corpsman faced life in prison for their roles in the Iraqi man's death. Article 32 is a documentary film that uncovers the truth of what happened that night in Iraq and the subsequent NCIS murder investigation. Shot in Hamdania, Iraq and the United States, Article 32 explores the morally brutalizing environment of the Iraq war and shines a light on the gray area between the established Rules of Engagement and the basic rule of \"Do what you have to do to come home alive.\"", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
