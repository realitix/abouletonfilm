All visitors to his studio, the Factory. Subjects were captured in stark relief by a strong keylight, and filmed by Warhol with his stationary 16mm Bolex camera on silent, black and white, 100-foot rolls of film. The resulting two-and-a-half-minute film reels were then screened in slow motion, resulting in a fascinating collection of four-minute masterpieces that startle and entrance, mesmerizing in the purest sense of the word. Songwriters Dean Wareham and Britta Phillips, formerly of the band Luna and currently recording as Dean & Britta, incorporated original compositions as well as cover songs to create new soundtracks for the 13 films.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y0L8CGgz8YOcBM0zhV5wN0IyKBG.jpg", "actors": ["Paul America (Himself)", "Susan Bottomly (Herself)", "Ann Buchanan (Herself)", "Freddy Herko (Himself)", "Jane Holzer (Herself)", "Dennis Hopper (Himself)", "Billy Name (Himself)", "Nico (Herself)", "Richard Rheem (Himself)", "Lou Reed (Himself)", "Edie Sedgwick (Herself)", "Ingrid Superstar (Herself)", "Mary Woronov (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
