On the discovery that Ming was a 500-pound pound Tiger and Al a seven-foot alligator, their story took on an astonishing dimension. The film frames Yates\u2019s recollections with a poetic study of Ming and Al, the predators\u2019 presence combined with a text by philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy, reimagining the circumstances of the wild inside, animal names, strange territories, and human-animal relations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fxTjKTOeMZ8j2HrzuKGMI7K0UKK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
