Veteran documentary filmmaker Alex Jones conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide. The military industrial complex is transforming our once free nation into a giant prison camp. A cashless society control grid, constructed in the name of fighting terrorism, was actually built to enslave the American people. Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner -- it's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. This film exposes how the \"Continuity of Government\" program has established an all powerful shadow state. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, FEMA camps, and a shredded Constitution.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w14ZeGD55q5qtHtT28nIO3Dv8r1.jpg", "actors": ["Alex Jones (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [37592, 86694, 34319, 36713], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
