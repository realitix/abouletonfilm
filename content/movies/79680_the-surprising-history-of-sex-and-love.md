The documentary traces the story of changing social and religious attitudes to sex through a broad swathe of history. Starting with the place of \u2019sacred sex\u2019 in the ancient world and ending with a discussion of the contemporary relationship between sex, marketing and prurience, the film offers some kind of map of how we got from there to here, and indicates that changes in sexual attitudes are connected with issues of power and control.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3ZOCi1NbhR0T5cXM0H4BrT66hjB.jpg", "actors": ["Terry Jones (Himself)", "dr.
