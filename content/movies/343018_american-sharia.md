Tension flares in The Motor City as Officer Richardson profiles every Muslim he sees as a terrorist. He goes on an arrest frenzy, which makes the community activists, Jihad and Osama take to the streets and rally the people to stand up for their rights. The Chief of Police wants to gain the trust of the Muslim community in order to get re-elected, but Attorney Leila Rodriguez is standing in the way with a discrimination law suit against Officer Richardson and the Motor City Police Department. The Chief calls on his most unreliable detective, Mohammed and partners him with a Middle Eastern, Sharia Law fanatic, Detective Abdul. The Chief wants them to \"Speak Muslim To The Muslims\" which he thinks will guarantee his re-election.  - Written by Omar Regan", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ad7FHjEN89k9ivwNPSUZebswuZd.jpg", "actors": ["Omar Regan (Mo)", "Eric Roberts (Officer Richardson)", "Joshua Salaam (Police Chief)", "Baba Ali (Abdul)", "Quadir Lateef (Sgt.
