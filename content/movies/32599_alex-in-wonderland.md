In its previews, the movie is considered a critical, artistic and surefire commercial success. As such, Alex seemingly has his choice of what his next project will be.  Alex has a few thoughts in mind, such as a biopic of Lenny Bruce, or a movie about a black uprising in Los Angeles. As he makes the rounds both in the Hollywood community and European movie centers for ideas, he fantasizes about movie scenarios of those everyday situations he is in. These fantasies are influenced by his movie idols, some who he meets such as Italian director Federico Fellini and French actress Jeanne Moreau.  Concurrently, he is considering what to do about his personal life.  He is wondering if he and his middle-class family should \"move up\". The need for commercial success may ultimately take artistic control out of his hands.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3kH8QnQL4T9ApYCaBYCaLX9YOBK.jpg", "actors": ["Donald Sutherland (Alex Morrison)", "Ellen Burstyn (Beth Morrison)", "Meg Mazursky (Amy)", "Glenna Sargent (Nancy)", "Viola Spolin (Mother)", "Joan Delaney (Jane)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [85635, 85643, 114556, 72449], "youtube_key": "iDQO2TyQ31c"}
