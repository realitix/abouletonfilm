The Elephant Lounge discotheque, open since 1974 in M\u00fcnster\u2019s historic old town, is the starting point for the investigation. Following the schlager boom of the 1950s, Germany\u2019s Tin Pan Alley spent decades leading a successful niche existence. After its first renaissance in the 1990s, German pop music is currently experiencing another wave of new, more electronically tinged German-language music whose lyrics and aesthetic tastes are closely associated with the schlager model. Their external perspective enables the artist duo, who live in Brazil, to view this development and its overall sociocultural context.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
