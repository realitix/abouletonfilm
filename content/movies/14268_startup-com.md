This documentary tracks the rise and fall of govWorks.com from May of 1999 to December of 2000, and the trials the business brings to the relationship of these best friends. Kaleil raises the money, Tom's the technical chief. A third partner wants a buy out; girlfriends come and go; Tom's daughter needs attention. And always the need for cash and for improving the site. Venture capital comes in by the millions. Kaleil is on C-SPAN, CNN, and magazine covers. Will the business or the friendship crash first?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rPn4JMtLiMVmUeF4RuRSw1ScrsD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [180141, 121203, 36497, 19153], "youtube_key": "bZ27rbJH6hI"}
