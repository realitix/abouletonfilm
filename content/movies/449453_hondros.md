Driven by a commitment to bear witness to the wars of our time after the events of 9/11, Chris was among the first in a new generation of war photographers since Vietnam. HONDROS explores the complexities inherent in covering more than a decade of conflict, while trying to maintain a normal life. It also examines the unknowable calculus involved in making split-second life and death decisions -- before, during and after his photos were made. Chris was killed in Libya in 2011, but he left a lasting impact on his profession that is still felt today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eRk9EmZY93TAvBWu5wWz534ISYP.jpg", "actors": ["Chris Hondros (Himself)", "Pancho Bernasconi (Himself)", "Greg Campbell (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [358926, 503150], "youtube_key": "PFRAHJ-3HY4"}
