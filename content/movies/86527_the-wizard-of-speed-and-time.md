Along the way, he gives a pretty girl a swift lift to another city, gives golden stars to other women who want a trip themselves. He then slips on a banana peel and comically crashes into a film stage, which he then brings to life in magical ways.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/umJAlJJTixW1duXXbTSL4USJeG8.jpg", "actors": ["Mike Jittlov (The Wizard)", "Toni Handcock (Hitchhiker)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [48331, 63317, 104404, 94055], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
