In her delirium, she imagines she is hitchhiking to attend the final concert of a rock star known as \"The Wizard\" (Graham Matters).  All the characters from the classic children's tale appear on her journey, transformed into modern-day Australian characters.  The Scarecrow is a somewhat dim-witted surfer-lad (in Australian lingo, a \"surfie\"), a cowardly biker is, of course, the Cowardly Lion, and so on.  This musical is not designed for younger children, and is instead suitable for mature teens and young adults.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/no3UT1UNNhSnBWffwGNibujCI1b.jpg", "actors": ["Joy Dunstan ()", "Graham Matters ()", "Bruce Spence ()", "Michael Carman ()", "Gary Waddell ()", "Robin Ramsay ()", "Paula Maxwell ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [42688, 69292, 93939], "youtube_key": "KJD8xFpvuiw"}
