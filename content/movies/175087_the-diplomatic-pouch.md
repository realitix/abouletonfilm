He dies (naturally having a vision of Lenin as he passes) and entrusts the eponymous pouch to the worker - who just happens to have a relative heading to Leningrad with his ship and all the sailors just happen to be Soviet sympathisers. Will they escape the evil Bourgoise police?!?!?!?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aOSNCWfDQdQJ2vf6ZdKSHPVuiTk.jpg", "actors": ["M. Buyukli ()", "A.
