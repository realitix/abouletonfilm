They end up in the remote mountain town of Blueridge, where Karen (Marina Resa) believes her older sister went missing 2 years before. After a few odd encounters with the locals, Karen and her friends decide to continue their journey until an unexpected auto malfunction leaves them stranded. The group takes refuge in a local motel and soon learns that in Blueridge, \"missing persons\" is just a way of life. One-by-one they begin disappearing until the grizzly discovery is made that the local BBQ Rib Restaurant might be serving up more than anyone had bargained.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1wVLuFbuhYRbF9ikgmFlP8hhZEz.jpg", "actors": ["Marina Resa (Karen)", "Elio Mardini (Nick)", "Dusty Probert (Gus)", "Matthew Schiltz (Vince)", "Fragino M.
