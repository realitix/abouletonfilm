N. , one of four nurses waiting for a team of divers as they emerge from the NYC sewer system after searching for alligators. (Yes, alligators. )An anonymous voice booming from an unseen helicopter keeps shouting commands to the nurses and the scuba team, as clothes come off and bodies are hosed down. \"Oh the humility! \" exclaims Bobby Astyr, though, of course, what he meant to say was \"humiliation\". Then the underground explorers are zapped by ultra-violet rays. What's going on? Astyr wants to know, too. Well, the nurses are there to take a sperm count. \"After diving for alligators all day\", says Astyr, \"I think I'll dive for muff! \" The big question, however, has to do with \"what they saw down there\", and they're kept in porno quarantine in the meantime. . . and we all know what that means.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/27HnjHLbdWZ5I7GvlkVflsKdd3u.jpg", "actors": ["Bobby Astyr (First Sewer Worker)", "Annie Sprinkle (First Nurse)", "Holly Bush (Nurse wearing Cap)", "Nikki Hilton (Curly-Haired Nurse)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
