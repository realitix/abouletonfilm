No longer famous, he now lives a comfortably numb existence working on an organic farm outside Los Angeles. He drinks himself into a stupor every night and retires to his shabby apartment to record his podcast, recounting the tragic deaths of great musicians. After a particularly heavy night of drowning his sorrows at a local watering hole, he is arrested for driving under the influence. This snag, coupled with a long-ago conviction for a drug offense, means Lachlan faces possible deportation. His only hope of remaining stateside is proving that his absence would cause extreme hardship for a spouse or relative \u2013 forcing him to confront relationships he thought were buried forever.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iiSXf9uZXAQEfpaFS201MMbntgo.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Carlyle (Lachlan MacAldonich)", "Alexia Rasmussen (Beau)", "Kathleen Wilhoite (Catherine)", "A Martinez (Warren)", "Danny Masterson (Paul)", "William Russ (Rusty)", "Michael Des Barres (Wendell)", "Patrick Gallagher (Ice Officer)", "Brad Greenquist (Piper)", "Ella Joyce (Carol)", "Eli Vargas (Julian)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [56928, 15075, 45881, 13571], "youtube_key": "5nfkvOJQRXk"}
