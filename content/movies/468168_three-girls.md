They \"breathe the same air\", but are in different walks of life: Jinzhu is a factory worker. She gets raped by Japanese soldiers in the very first seconds of the film, and much of the rest deals with the social consequences this has for her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9PzFimuHnZUzptti0RnLooWkchR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
