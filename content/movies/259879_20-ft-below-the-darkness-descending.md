When a young documentary filmmaker goes into these tunnels to uncover the unseen stories of the people living below our feet, she finds out that there is more to be afraid of than the dark. A mysterious figure, living beyond the reach of the law, has declared war on the outside world that threatens to tear apart the fragile underground society living in the tunnels and maybe even the city above it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b3Os1sSweel3QIYxGIqeL6W4BCy.jpg", "actors": ["Danny Trejo (Angel)", "Kinga Philipps (Chelsea)", "Frank Krueger (Jake)", "John Hennigan (Razor)", "Tiffany Adams (Gabriel)", "Kristoff St. John (Smitty)", "Louis Mandylor (Lockeheed)", "Michael Rene Walton (Skeeter)", "Darren Darnborough (Ajax)", "Chase Austin (Flash)", "Nicci Faires (Alexis)", "Wylie Small (Harmony)", "Melina Perez (Jade)", "Sara Maraffino (Hawk)", "Magdaleno Robles Jr. (Dante)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [32012, 152348, 104217, 108774], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
