The movie is of the old-school nomadic, skate-everything-in-your-path genre with interludes of stopping to rip-up a big ramp, pool or kicker. After much searching and skateboarding, they locate a large ramp in the desert. They also find a Chinese character on the inside of the ramp's spine. They conclude that in searching for Mr. Chin, they may have found his spirit.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m2yyAip1hh7jffUTRk6xZstiYx4.jpg", "actors": ["Steve Caballero (Himself)", "Skip Engblom (Himself / Bouncer)", "Gerrit Graham (Himself)", "Tommy Guerrero (Himself)", "Tony Hawk (Himself)", "Mike McGill (Himself)", "Rodney Mullen (Himself)", "Lance Mountain (Himself)", "Mike Vallely (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
