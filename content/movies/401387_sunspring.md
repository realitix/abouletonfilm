You know it's the future because H (played with neurotic gravity by Silicon Valley's Thomas Middleditch) is wearing a shiny gold jacket, H2 (Elisabeth Gray) is playing with computers, and C (Humphrey Ker) announces that he has to \"go to the skull\" before sticking his face into a bunch of green lights. It sounds like your typical sci-fi B-movie, complete with an incoherent plot. Except Sunspring isn't the product of Hollywood hacks\u2014it was written entirely by an AI. To be specific, it was authored by a recurrent neural network called long short-term memory, or LSTM for short. At least, that's what we'd call it. The AI named itself Benjamin.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sKBTE5ukRfnhHJuK1yJYCBNLlny.jpg", "actors": ["Thomas Middleditch (H)", "Humphrey Ker (C)", "Elisabeth Gray (H2)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
