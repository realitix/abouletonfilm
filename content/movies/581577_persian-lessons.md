This lie really saves his life, but Gilles cannot even imagine at what price. German soldiers, satisfied with such a rare catch, lead Gilles to Klaus Koch, a cook in a concentration camp, who dreams, as soon as the war is over, to leave for Iran and open a restaurant there. Koch is looking for a real Persian who will teach him to speak Persian. So begins the story of Gilles Cremieu and Klaus Koch - a Jew and a German, a prisoner and jailer, a student and a teacher.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Lars Eidinger (Koch)", "Nahuel P\u00e9rez Biscayart (Gilles)", "Leonie Benesch (Elsa)", "Lola Bessis (Melanie)", "Alexander Beyer (Kommandant)", "Nico Ehrenteit (Obersturmf\u00fchrer Krupp)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
