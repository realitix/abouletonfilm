Some 500 years later, Michael Hardt, political philosopher and co-author of Empire, Multitude and Commonwealth, asks what it would mean to base a political system on love, rather than on fear. How can we transform a society that is increasingly defined by a permanent state of war and cultivated by an industry of fear? How can we realize the paradigm shift necessary to move away from a reality that depends on the exploitation of people and the cult of privatisation of public resources?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Michael Hardt (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
