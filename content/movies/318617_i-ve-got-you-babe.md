This film depicts the struggle of modern man to choose between bachelorhood and marriage. A sensitive yet comical look at love and commitment between men and women in the '90s. Chronicling the lives of a typical yuppie couple, Charcoal (Lau Ching-Wan) and Veronica (Ron for short) (Anita Yuen). Anita's goal in life is to have a baby, which certainly is not Charcoal's goal. Anita's best friend Ada (Lai Mei-Han) and her husband (Dayo Wong) are having a baby at the same time. However, Dayo surprisingly is a womanizer which leads to problems between the couple. In addition, Charcoal's ex-fiance Joyce (Annabelle Hui) is always around the corner.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/btdipU3YzvfodLSO1ZSRNTt0D23.jpg", "actors": ["Lau Ching Wan (Charcoal)", "Anita Yuen (Ron)", "Dayo Wong ()", "Kitty Lai Mei-Han ()", "Annabelle Lau ()", "Yiu Wing-Mui ()", "Louisa So Yuk-Wa ()", "Woo Siu-Yin ()", "Law Kar ()", "Kim Yip ()", "James Yuen ()", "Joe Cheung ()", "Joe Ma Wai-Ho ()", "Terence Yung Ji-Chung ()", "Andrew Lai Pak-Kan ()", "Lorraine Hoh Lai-Seung ()", "Lee Hok-Ming ()", "Tse Siu-Yin ()", "Lee Hiu-Tung ()", "Margaret Lam ()", "Mok Suet-Wa ()", "\tCheung Chi-Sing ()", "Kwok Yi-Na ()", "Chan Lai-Fan ()", "Kong Yu-Fai ()", "Kong Yu-Man ()", "Au-Yeung Pui-Sze ()", "Liu Suk-Ching ()", "Fung Man-Ngai ()", "Teddy Chan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
