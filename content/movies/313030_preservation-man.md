In that, an alien presence surveys a stretch of coastline strewn with assorted objects from early 1960s British lifestyles and tries (and mostly fails) to divine their meaning or purpose. The Preservation Man is also set in a series of object-strewn settings, but here they're part of the artist Bruce Lacey's collection of random junk, and their original function is irrelevant. Sensibly, Russell and commentator Huw Wheldon keep analysis to a minimum, preferring to use the film as an excuse to spend quarter of an hour in Lacey's amiable company.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Bruce Lacey ()", "Huw Wheldon (Commentator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
