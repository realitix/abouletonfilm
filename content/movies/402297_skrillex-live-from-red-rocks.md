From the immense, custom-built stage set up to the incomparable track list, venues from San Diego to Miami became Skrillex\u2019s temporary home turf as he crossed back and forth across the United States and Canada.  One of his most noteworthy stops, and one that will surely go down in EDM history, was at Colorado\u2019s famous Red Rocks Amphitheatre on June 21, 2014. Coming as the final destination on the U.S. leg of his tour, crowds poured into the rock-enclosed arena for what would soon be remembered as the show of a lifetime.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9OMjhNrjnrHnh7eWrvakudaSVm7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "mMvq44Bvr-w"}
