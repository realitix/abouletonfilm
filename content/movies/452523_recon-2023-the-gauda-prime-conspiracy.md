Dispatched to the treacherous deserts of Gauda Prime, Lieutenant Sharp (Anderson Bradshaw) and his unit must find and destroy the enemy's central weapon, the dreaded Ma'har dream machine.  The obstacles are daunting- giant mutated creatures and an army of zombified sand troopers stand between the unit and their objective.
