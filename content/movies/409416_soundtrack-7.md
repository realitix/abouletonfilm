Conceptualized as an abstract autobiographical piece, Soundtrack 7 includes performances set to \u201cHow\u2019s That\u201d, \u201cUltraviolet,\u201d and \u201cGood to Love\u201d among others, and is bound together by a striking, repeated recitation of Thomas Wyatt\u2019s poem \u201cI Find No Peace\u201d (an excerpt from which opened twigs\u2019 critically acclaimed LP1). Emphasizing the grit and physicality of dance, twigs describes her latest project as \u201cflesh, sweat, feeling, muscle, and a live movement, no air brushing, no frills.\u201d  -BAMCinematek", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bYXxMIw2J2GS68nwtECp0PfLJfY.jpg", "actors": ["FKA Twigs (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
