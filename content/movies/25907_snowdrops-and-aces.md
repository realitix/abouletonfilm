Former schoolmates meet again in the mountains and it turns out they have not changed much. Even though so many years have passed, we can still see the souls of boys and girls we know from the teenage comedy Snowdrops and Aces; kids who participated in that legendary skiing course. Its nostalgic humour gives the film a bitter-sweet touch. Thawing Out follows the lives of the main heroes during a period of great changes. How did they manage to escape the traps and what scars have they suffered? Where did they want to go, how far have they got and what is still in front of them?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bIe8drHElaisYdriBq7WdkNanTH.jpg", "actors": ["V\u00e1clav Kopta (Radek P\u0159evr\u00e1til)", "Michal Such\u00e1nek (Karel M\u00e1cha)", "Jan Anton\u00edn Duchoslav (Viki Cabadaj)", "Radoslav Brzobohat\u00fd (profesor Karda)", "Veronika Freimanov\u00e1 (u\u010ditelka Hanka)", "Eva Jen\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 (Marika)", "Dan \u0160ediv\u00e1k ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [48460, 245191, 48641, 139085], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
