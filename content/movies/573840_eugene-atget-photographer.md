This meditative Arts Council documentary introduces Eug\u00e8ne Atget, a former actor who began to document the streets of old Paris from the 1890s. Little is known about his early life and the three decades he spent capturing, in eerie tableaux, urban spaces since lost to progress. The film includes dramatised scenes from his life, including his belated \u2018discovery\u2019 by American photographers Man Ray and Berenice Abbott, who published many of Atget\u2019s works after his death in 1927.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ypkCecDcYVe5h9yWlVOPtevBZei.jpg", "actors": ["Philippe Lehembre (Eugene Atget)", "Peggy Frankston (Berenice Abbott)", "Catherine Ohotnikoff (Madame Atget)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
