An occasional musician, Fred plans to pass himself off as that man. It's a goofy idea, but maybe it will work. However, before he can set up the con properly, he learns that his loser of a brother has, inexplicably, just gotten his first job in years as one of the detectives who is searching for the heir. At one time, the two brothers played together in an amateur rock band, but as a result of a heated disagreement about how to play the Ray Noble standard \"Cherokee\", the two haven't spoken in years. It's going to take a lot of persuading to pull this scam off.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/65yDQ9xlJ2mRLVYynU6dX5Ai6F1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
