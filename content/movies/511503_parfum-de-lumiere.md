This fragrant light in a revolving diamond-shaped bottle takes us through space and time, over a reinvented urban landscape where Hong Kong shows the way to Shanghai, while the photographer's inner city gives us a glimpse of the 21st century metropolises.  But this is not history, it's a story where light and shadows fight for territory on shifting battlefields, his and ours. Film without words.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
