In a never-ending stream of images, we recognize elements from the forest that he then reduces to an abstraction. The film came about as a classical composition in which the picture and the musical contribution of Jim O\u2019Rourke link up seamlessly and lead the mood in turn. A sense of freedom is what predominates.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wFpqGoquGWpAJt47L3rz6wVQtmv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
