Which of course is most known for being the main ground for the TV-series THE WIRE.\r\n\r\nIt focuses mainly one one kid called Pug who wants nothing more but to join the 12 O'Clock Boys \"gang\", I use that term lightly cause they aren't really a gang per se because the only illegal activities they do is ride their dirt-bikes on the streets where they are not allowed, performing various stunts etc.\r\n\r\nThey also interview some \"street-legends\" of the original 12'O Clock Boys who started out years ago and is still about that life.\r\n\r\nIt's a documentary the way it should be done, it doesn't try to push an agenda on you or condone the illegal activities nor show disdain for it, it just show you the way it is and how they use the riding as a release for whatever problems they have got going on.\r\n\r\n_-------- this review ^ was originally written in August of 2014 --------_"}], "recommandations_id": [96087, 253305, 172548, 54100]}
