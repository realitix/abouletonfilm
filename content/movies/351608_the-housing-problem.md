In this one, though, the family having a housing problem is a family of pigs. They trail moving vans and investigate \"For Rent\" signs, and even try to move the dogs out of their kennel. Finally, they buy a prefabricated house, have a very hard time putting it together and, then, termites show up and destroy their new home.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
