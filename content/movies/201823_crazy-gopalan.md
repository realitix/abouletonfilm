Though nobody has seen Gopalan, people hold him in dread as he is a thief who always manages to steal whatever he wants, without ever getting caught or even being seen by anyone. His identity remains a mystery.  Then one day Harishchandran (Harisree Asokan), a carpenter happens to see Gopalan for the first time. Gopalan is thus forced to flee the little village and seeks refuge in the city.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cIHFM7jnJ1ALgQoALFtDvG9zxCm.jpg", "actors": ["Dileep (Gopalan)", "Salim Kumar (Laxmanan)", "Jagathy Sreekumar (Lavang Vasu)", "Manoj K Jayan (Babu John)", "Sunitha Varma (Diana John)", "Biju Menon (Police Commissioner)", "Harisree Ashokan (Harischandran)", "Mohan Jose (Chacko K.T)", "Kollam Thulasi (Circle Inspector)", "Indrans (Sugunan)", "Janardhanan ()", "Kalabhavan Shajon (Police Officer)", "Narayanankutty ()", "Cherthala Lalitha ()", "Manju Satheesh (Babu's wife)", "Santha Devi (Janakiyamma)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [277992, 78681, 332253, 237725], "youtube_key": "ri_d_tF2DbA"}
