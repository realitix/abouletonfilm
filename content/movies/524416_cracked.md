Kendall Elizabeth Katrine (Jordan-Paige Sudduth) has gone through a lot of her life with her best friend, Zander Cordova (Cobin Bugni), by her side. He\u2019s stuck by her through thick and thin. Whether she's at school or in the hospital, he's there. But when Zander starts to go off the wrong path, Kendall is ready to jump in and save him, just as he\u2019s done for her, but someone else beats her to it. As Zander gets into a relationship with Rosemary Hiltz (Amanda Villa), Kendall is slowly being forgotten. As relationships progress, problems arise and truth comes out, proving that despite outer appearances, everyone\u2019s lives are a little bit cracked.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2Q1cynQAzYooKNMewsxbhTMKxfc.jpg", "actors": ["Jordan-Paige Sudduth (Kendall Katrine)", "Cobin Bugni (Zander Cordova)", "Aly Ward Azevedo (Bryn Walshman)", "Amanda Villa (Rosemary Hiltz)", "Christian Mullican (Isaiah Hiltz)", "Riley Durbin (Mason Sacher)", "Mark Story (Drew Katrine)", "Sarah Fechter (Janet Cordova)", "Eric James Morris (Trevor Cordova)", "Shere Ladd (Sara Cordova)", "Darian Fisher (Richard Hiltz)", "Sean Patrick (James Hiltz)", "Audrey Black (Tessa)", "Kayti Ducheine (Sara)", "MacKenzie Harrill (Kenzie)", "Samone Pittman (Marie)", "Elizabeth G Smith (Clara)", "Brent Breshers (Dr. Moxon)", "Justin David (Mr. Markens)", "Parker Hughes (Mrs. Brownell)", "David Williams (Mr. Sacher)", "Tasha Renee (Mrs. Tanowitz)", "Cindy Jordan (Mrs. Sacher (as Cynthia Cindy Jordan))", "Laura Doman (Mary Katrine)", "Natalie Ciccia (Young Kendall)", "Parker Mednikow (Young Zander)", "Cindy Ralston (Joan Lowe)", "Kenny Hughes (Officer Oliver Lurgen)", "Madison Granito (Secretary)", "Kirsten Milsap (Nurse)", "Leydi Morales (Receptionist)", "Eric Bailey Jr. (Doctor (voice))", "Lynn Grace (Eulogist (voice))", "Aidan Schroeder (Boy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "MEvDr8bYaSY"}
