An obvious connection is that all the victims are women, and they were all in the same class, and Beck thinks that a scandal back in the past has something to do with the murders. But no one wants to talk about the past and it becomes a struggle to find the perpetrator before the final murder - only one woman is still alive.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gs7mAmHm8yFn6H46XlCdLWHQaKQ.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Haber (Martin Beck)", "Mikael Persbrandt (Gunvald Larsson)", "Stina Rautelin (Lena Klingstr\u00f6m)", "Per Morberg (Joakim Wers\u00e9n)", "Ingvar Hirdwall (The Neighbor)", "Rebecka Hemse (Inger)", "Fredrik Ultvedt (Jens Lofteg\u00e5rd)", "Michael Nyqvist (John Banck)", "Anna Ulrika Ericsson (Yvonne J\u00e4der)", "Peter H\u00fcttner (Oljelund)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [270046, 270044, 24771, 270105], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
