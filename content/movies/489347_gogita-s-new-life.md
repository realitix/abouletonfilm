His wishes seem modest enough: a home of his own and then marriage to a nice woman. But who would be interested in a poor farmer and ex-con who still lives with his mother? Then he meets Maka on the internet. She's not that young anymore, and she's not the prettiest girl in the world, but she can bake delicious cakes. They're soon making grand plans without even having met.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2pSZ53iQamzsSwjhXowaxOSau7p.jpg", "actors": ["Gogita Chitishvili (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
