The near-miss triggers bizarre hallucinations in Nami, and she imagines herself engaged in various S&M situations with Muraki, in which she is beaten, forced to urinate, and tortured on the titular wooden horse. The hallucinations grow progressively more real (and exciting) to Nami, and soon Muraki is accused of raping her and loses his teaching position.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rUJbi3AixUCSKeb4uSgb2AlIXyt.jpg", "actors": ["Serina Nishikawa (Nami Tsuchiya)", "Waka Oda ()", "Anri Megumi ()", "Shir\u00f4 Shimomoto (Muraki)", "Hideo Shirayama ()", "Yoko Ishido (Muraki's wife)", "Ry\u00f4ichi Kusanagi (Sugiura)", "Asami Ogawa (Junko Tsuchiya)", "Kazuyo Ezaki (Izumi Yamauchi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
