The Baron grants the request, but only for a barren, rocky, useless acreage. The pair struggle to make do on this land, but then the Baron demands that Maria leave her husband to serve as wet nurse to his married daughter Anya's new baby, on threat of eviction. While nursing the daughter's baby, Maria receives unwelcome attentions from the daughter's husband, and a scandal erupts, ruining Maria in her husband's eyes. When she escapes from her employers and seeks to return home, the police give her the yellow passport signifying a prostitute, further degrading her. She approaches home, unsure of the reception that awaits her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fyLhgk4hhvchgfvd38qkV1bASuY.jpg", "actors": ["Anna Sten (Maria, young farmer's wife)", "Ivan Koval-Samborsky (Jacob)", "Vladimir Fogel (Anya's husband)", "Anel Sudakevich (Anya - Baron's married daughter)", "Mikhail Narokov (Belsky)", "Sofya Yakovleva (Katarina)", "Pyotr Baksheyev (Doorman, butler)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
