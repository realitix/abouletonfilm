Some of those images are explicitly macho: we see various body-builders flexing their biceps and triceps. Other images seen here are not macho in the literal sense, but are indirectly related to testosterone or cojones on some level: we see military aircraft making bombing raids, and footage of car crashes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g1qsUFeC2FLPewvse5Tk7vGDcGH.jpg", "actors": ["Reinhard Lichtenberg ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [85107, 118257, 105716, 203089], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
