This becomes the beginning of a friendship, which quickly turn into something more. The woman is named Carla and she comes from Equador, a war-torn country. She is deeply traumatized, but George helps her to recover, and even takes her back to Equador, to find the people she left behind, especially her old lover, Antonio.\r\n\r\nGeorge is played by Robert Carlyle, and he does a great and believable job. This guy has no hidden motive, except that he wants to help Carla, and sure, along the way, he finds himself in love with her. This movie is full of strong emotions and takes us from tears to laughter, to tears. These people are alive and not just created for the sake of our entertainment.\r\n\r\nKen Loach, together with Mike Leigh, are two of my favorite directors when it comes to personal and emtional stories. They always have something to say and don't just make movies for the sake of it. Their images are not particular beautiful, but they are honest.\r\n\r\n_Last words... big story, carefully told. Allow yourself to be emerged in Carla and George, and you are in for a special treat.This movie won't be for everyone, but everyone should see it and realize that movies can be... more._"}], "recommandations_id": [9097, 59058, 449435, 54012]}
