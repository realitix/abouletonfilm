Although it is commonly known today that meat and diary products are one of the primary causes for heart and other deadly diseases, Americans don't seem to care at all and are living (and dying) with them every day. When this award-winning documentary was first aired the US National Cattlemen's Association mounted an aggressive campaign to discredit the program and keep it from being aired. But the attempt to thwart the show failed, and the program went on to be one of public television's all-time most successful documentaries.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8fxtqWbJ0lkfodQgcXYO13kDcqx.jpg", "actors": ["John Robbins (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "esrbiWG8oG8"}
