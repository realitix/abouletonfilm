The duo documented more active and erupting volcanos than any other scientists in the world, and their dedication shows in Deadly Peaks and Killer Volcanos, two educational films that capture the scientists on the edge of a hot ash blast and floating on a lake of sulfuric acid. The films visit Mount Kilimanjaro and examine some of the less-known dangers such as carbon monoxide gas that builds under crater-formed lakes. They also take an in-depth look at the eruption of Mount St. Helens and the lengths to which people will go to save their communities. Venturing to places where most people would never dare, the Kraffts gave their lives to promote the study of volcanos and left behind a legacy of courage in the name of science. --Shannon Gee", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ngyDg7vHvcDiwOxBM5O47LYzVE1.jpg", "actors": ["Maurice Krafft ()", "Katia Krafft ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
