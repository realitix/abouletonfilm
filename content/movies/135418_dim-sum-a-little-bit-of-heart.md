Geraldine does have a boyfriend, but she's not sure she's ready for marriage, and, anyway, he lives in Los Angeles and Geraldine doesn't want to leave her mother alone in her declining years. Mrs. Tan's cheerful brother-in-law tries to help out. Is there any solution that will enable Mrs. Tan to hold onto her culturally-influenced and deep-seated hopes, yet keep those hopes from suffocating Geraldine?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/me5D6s47C5i1M3xT1KRTWF7l3wV.jpg", "actors": ["Laureen Chew (Geraldine Tam)", "Kim Chew (Mrs. Tam)", "Victor Wong (Uncle Tam)", "Ida F.O.
