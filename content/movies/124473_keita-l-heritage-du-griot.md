While his parents are taking a nap, he reads a schoolbook on the front porch when a stranger - an elderly man carrying his own hammock - appears for an unexpected visit. It turns out that the old man is a griot, a West African musician/entertainer whose performances include tribal histories and genealogies. The position of a griot is a time-honored one and passed down from father to son for many generations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/66D2WIqAQmnRl98LEgP7Nioxahw.jpg", "actors": ["Seydou Boro (Sundjata Keita)", "Hamed Dicko (Mabo Ke\u00efta)", "Abdoulaye Komboudri (M Fafana)", "Sotigui Kouyat\u00e9 (Djeliba Kouyat\u00e9)", "Claire Sanon (Sitan)", "Blandine Yam\u00e9ogo (Sogoton)", "Seydou Rouamba ()", "Mamadou Sarr ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
