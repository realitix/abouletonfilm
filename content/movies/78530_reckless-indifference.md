Reckless Indifference explores how California\u2019s controversial felony murder rule unjustly changed the lives of four teenagers forever. After participating in a backyard brawl which resulted in the death of a LAPD officer\u2019s son, the ensuing trial led to life without parole sentences for the accused, even though the evidence against them was not clear-cut. Ten years have passed and they are still behind bars, though an appeal is pending. With revealing interviews from legal expert Alan Dershowitz, family members on both sides, and an exclusive recent interview with Brandon Hein from his jail cell, Reckless Indifference gives viewers an inside look into a trial that earned national attention but failed to bring justice to those involved.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AcN9hQNRSWS2CVJJ0e04IiVxC3k.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Derham ()", "Alan Dershowitz ()", "Dick Detrich ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
