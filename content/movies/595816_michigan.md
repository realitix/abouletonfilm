It is also one man\u2019s attempt to reconcile the guilt and self-destruction that torment him as a result of his early years in this small town. This journey is filled with eerie undercurrents of religious themes, petty violence, corroded value systems, industry, and the destructive forces of abuse, addiction, ego, and self-absorption. The film is an epic contrast of Michigan\u2019s wild beauty with bitter isolation; with the American dream and social nightmares; with success and sacrifice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kOGTcW5irvoJYyyHVxNs6qljZf9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
