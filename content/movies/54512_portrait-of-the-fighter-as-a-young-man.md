Over a thousand armed resistance groups took refuge in the inaccessible forests of the Carpathian Mountains where they waited in vain for the support of the Western Allies. One of them was led by Ion Gavril\u0103-Ogoranu, who managed to remain undetected until 1976 when he was arrested. This film depicts the daily existence of this group. It tells the story of a struggle that became an end in itself, as the enemy was constantly in pursuit and arrest meant torture and often liquidation. Hungry and emotionally withdrawn, the group of young men got entangled in a partisan war that could not be won, lost in the landscape of the South Carpathians, accompanied by a vigilant secret police, the Securitate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/FNoJGYdtxwIvT7fp8jftIsT5A6.jpg", "actors": ["Constantin Di\u0163\u0103 (Ion Gavril\u0103 Ogoranu)", "Ionu\u0163 Caras (Gheorghe Ha\u015fiu)", "C\u0103t\u0103lin Babliuc (Ion Chiujdea)", "Ion Bechet (Nelu Novac)", "Vasile Calofir (Andrei Ha\u015fiu)", "Constantin Lupescu (Ion Ilioi)", "Dan Bordeianu (Victor Metea)", "Alexandru Potocean (Toma Pir\u0103u)", "Alin Mihalache (Gheorghe \u015eov\u0103ial\u0103)", "Radu Iacoban (Gelu Novac)", "Bogdan Dumitrache (Laurian Hasiu - Leu)", "Bogdan Dumitrescu (Jean Pop - Fileru)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ynbZIb76efI"}
