For one thing, Romano doesn't sound much like himself. For another, he always seems to be hiding something. Detective Lee (William Gargan) suspects that something's amiss, and he's probably right! A pedestrian effort with excellent cinematography by Stanley Cortez.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/SAwX67WRysBifCOMe11XvEi8p8.jpg", "actors": ["William Gargan (Lee Davis)", "June Clyde (Lois Grant)", "John Litel (Mike Rofano / Fred Morton)", "Anne Nagel (Mrs. Fred (Mary) Morton)", "Mary Gordon (Mrs. Ann Morton (Fred's mother))", "Ralf Harolde (Lips Haggarty)", "Joseph Crehan (Chief Charles R.
