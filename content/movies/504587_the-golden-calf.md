The friend begins a total make-over upon her friend. First she slathers her in mud-packs, and then she encases her in lovely silk dresses. Soon the plain woman is transformed into an extraordinary beauty. It is no surprise that her boss, not knowing her true identity, falls hopelessly in love with her. Singing, dancing and romancing ensues. Songs include: \"A Picture No Artist Can Paint,\" \"You Gotta Be Modernistic,\" \"I'm Telling the World About You,\" \"Maybe Someday,\" and \"Can I Help It.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wIM7RJLYVkOdj2lxT7zaRYCsfgR.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Mulhall (Philip Homer)", "Sue Carol (Marybelle Cobb)", "El Brendel (Knute Olson)", "Marjorie White (Alice)", "Richard Keene (Tommy)", "Paul Page (Edwards)", "Walter Catlett (Master of Ceremonies)", "Ilka Chase (Comedienne)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
