When a gorgeous girl named Rima transfers into Masami's class, she's not only jealous, but also deathly frightened of her. While the boys in class are tripping all over themselves to get to Rima, Masami's having nightmares of a ghastly visitor and finding scars on her body come morning. She asks a friend to help her get evidence to confirm her suspicions about the new girl. But if a picture is worth a thousand words, a video must be worth far more. 2. Shy Miko and her more outgoing friend Nanako are enjoying their summer vacation, trying to make the most of their youth. But when horror-movie marathons just aren't thrilling enough, Nanako sets her eyes on a new target: an abandoned mansion at the edge of town, said to be haunted. With two other friends in tow, a reluctant Miko and a gung-ho Nanako enter the mansion. Soon, everything that can go wrong starts going wrong.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8k3paEk5nuAva7UY1EjuuoGLn5K.jpg", "actors": ["Ikuya Sawaki (Narrator)", "Shinobu Adachi (Rima)", "Ai Orikasa (Nanako)", "Rei Sakuma (Miko)", "Naoko Watanabe (Masami)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
