We realized we had such great footage from those days that we thought it would be cool to put together a documentary inspired stylistically by Fugazi's Instrument. We asked our friend Melissa Kraemer to lead the project and she did an amazing job editing together the story of I Am The Movie through the songs, from start to end.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4y61M0TKQ29ySt7q1GF6ZCGsFrr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
