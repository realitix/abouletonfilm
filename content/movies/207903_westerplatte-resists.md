Before World War II, it functioned as a Polish ammunition depot in the Free City of Danzig/Gdansk. Its crew consisted of one infantry company and a group of civilians, 182 people in total. It was the only Polish guard-post at the mouth of the Vistula River, with as little as five sentries, one field cannon, two anti-armour guns and four mortars. It was the first obstacle to Hitler's predatory march across Europe. The first shots of World War II were fired here. This film tells the story of Westerplatte's courageous defenders.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kilBBhtjnaHluKIY8Biuo7rzapC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
