The fictional sequences include a vignette about a Guangzhou father and daughter; another about a Taiwan taxi driver and passenger; and a third about a Shanghai delivery boy. All are affected by the lure of a Mayday gathering and the three separate stories intersect at one particular Mayday concert in Shanghai.  Established in Taiwan in the late 1990s, Mayday has remained popular for over a decade by tuning into a Taiwan youth beat and pushing rock music in Greater China. Most songs are performed in Mandarin with some Taiwanese Hokkien tracks by band.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cfdGuAtbZRFfexVzxPUsR3gXsvf.jpg", "actors": ["\u4e94\u6708\u5929 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
