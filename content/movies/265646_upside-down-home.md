They grow to become teenagers, locked down in one of many low income neighborhoods made up of identical small houses, outlined by overcrowding and scarcity. Their mothers, mostly workers in transnational factories, go in and out in buses that take them to a work place where they carry out twelve hour shifts two hours away from home, while their children muddle through their upbringing in tiny houses of 40 square meters. In spite of everything, they look for a way to move ahead and chase their illusions. This is a story full of youthful aspirations set in a context of difficulties and shortages.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xX4PxjNesZXsb8xpFJpjWpQuBFP.jpg", "actors": ["Luis Omar Rodr\u00edguez D\u00edaz ()", "Gerardo Ruiz Zerrano ()", "Santos P\u00e9rez Varela ()", "X\u00f3chitl Mart\u00ednez Santiago ()", "Elizabeth Calder\u00f3n Rivera ()", "Norma Rodr\u00edguez ()", "Rafael Moreno ()", "Ebed Basurto ()", "Alberto Rodr\u00edguez D\u00edaz ()", "Guillermo P\u00e9rez Varela ()", "Karen Hern\u00e1ndez ()", "B\u00e1rbara Barraza ()", "Janeth P\u00e9rez Varela ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
