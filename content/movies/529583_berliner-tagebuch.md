I want to stay where I\u2019ve never been.\u2019 Filmmaker Rosemarie Blank was born in Berlin, but has lived in various other places in the world. After returning to her native city, she wondered what it\u2019s like for other people to live outside their motherland. In this diary, she interviews people whom she literally met in the street: her Kurdish newsvendor, who apart from his busy trade has a second job with the German railways, a Lebanese hairdresser, a Turkish furniture seller. They talk about melancholy, longing, the struggle for existence and against discrimination and they show how they lead their daily life. The encounters are larded with observing shots of multicultural Berlin, particularly where diversity is most visible: the subway.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uGkNZSdtV8uozy593gs4qS1Lw8h.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "S5Bn1Grl8Ns"}
