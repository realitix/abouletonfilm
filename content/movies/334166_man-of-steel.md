But - surprise! - Klondike Joe is no longer a drunk. Instead, he\u2019s been \"converted by this BARRY MOORE fellow,\" a real-life evangelist who \"transformed\" Joe and now starts on Jeff and Kevin. Sure enough, not only does Jeff start reading the Bible, but loses interest in the company because he\u2019s \"had a transforming experience with Jesus Christ!\" Kevin, on the other hand, becomes a teenage drunk after his white-trash girlfriend Dana tries to lure him away from religion with parties and \u00ad gasp! - bottles of beer. But when one of Kevin\u2019s drunken buddies puts on a dress and falls off the roof of a house, Kevin wants to take Dana to Barry\u2019s Big Crusade.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bOtv8uDNHiJhILNlrY8SoHKBhqa.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
