This left a large number of unemployed samurai with nothing to do, and their morale suffered. In order to raise their spirits, the Shogun's Chief Advisor suggests that they hold a \"Festival of Swordsmen\" in the Shogun's presence. Problems arise when some of the martial artists bring their personal grudges to the competition. When Busshi Shirogoro (OTOMO) meets the daughter of the late Lord SANADA Yukimura sparks fly as she tries to use the competition to carry out her vengeance against Shogun Iemitsu.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9LinHbvOrguenKaD7MPIDgRYSpT.jpg", "actors": ["Ryutaro Otomo (Busshi Shirogoro)", "Shingo Yamashiro ()", "Tomisabur\u014d Wakayama (Iishiro Shurinosuke)", "Keiko Okawa (Satomi)", "Eiji Okada (Kamio Shume)", "Satomi Oka ()", "Ry\u00f4suke Kagawa ()", "Shunji Sakai ()", "Kunio Kaga ()", "Yoshio Yoshida ()", "Eitar\u00f4 Shind\u00f4 ()", "Ryuji Kita ()", "Kensaku Hara ()", "Jotaro Togami ()", "Kyoji Sugi ()", "Shinnosuke Ogata ()", "Otabe Michimaro ()", "Kazutar\u00f4 Kuni ()", "Shintaro Nasu ()", "Kin'nosuke Fujiki ()", "Kinjir\u00f4 Tooyama ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
