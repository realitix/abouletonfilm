Rankin (not Rankins) shoots Tug, who is unaware of Rankin's lawless activities, in an argument and Jim is accused of murder and also stampeding the sheep. Believing Jim is guilty, Tug's daughter, Ruth, aids Buck in capturing Jim, but he escapes. Ruth gets help from Sheriff Hank Bosley, and a sheepherder, Sanchez, reveals Rankin's responsibility for both the rustling of Bledsoe's cattle and the killing of Wilson.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mbBTmVC74AfQn9R6pmzGjLfkv4W.jpg", "actors": ["Bob Steele (Jim Bledsoe)", "Lafe McKee (Tom Bledsoe)", "Al Ferguson (Buck Rankin)", "Alfred Hewston (Tug Wilson)", "Louise Lorraine (Ruth Wilson)", "Hank Bell (Sheriff Hank)", "Clark Comstock (Man with Pipe)", "Jim Corey (Henchman)", "Johnny Luther (Cowhand Singer)", "Cliff Lyons (Lefty - Henchman)", "Merrill McCormick (Frenchy Sanchez - the Shepherd)", "Perry Murdock (Perry - Cowhand)", "Tex Palmer (Cowhand)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
