Yes, the film suffers from the technical limitations of the time (audio, fixed lenses and single camera shots) as well as an acting style which is in the transition from silent to talkie, but these are fairly easy to overlook. Actually the sound is quite good. Many films suffered from clomping on every footstep, this one does not."}], "recommandations_id": []}
