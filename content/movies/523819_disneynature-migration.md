To answer the questions of why and how hundreds of thousands of animals, birds and insects leave their homes to travel up to thousands of miles before returning, we'll follow several species as they make their miraculous journeys. Along the way, we'll see how both man and nature may conspire against these creatures, making their remarkable treks even more improbable. Designed specifically for classroom use, Disneynature Migration is correlated to National Curriculum Standards and contains additional educational features such as an interactive assessment tool and a downloadable educator's guide with activities and resources. The DVD also features a special look at a sea turtle conservation project that highlights the importance of preserving the delicate balance between humans and nature.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8iNULebaGIjQD6M77xyIGwLRdxH.jpg", "actors": ["Lucas Grabeel (Voice)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
