IN THE CONSERVATORY experimentally captures the essence of the place, through the use of direct animation, ambient sound, and music. Plants from the conservatory\u2019s winter collection were gleaned and pasted onto clear, 16mm film leader, then re-photographed on an optical printer while they were still fresh, resulting in a second, chance animation. The soundtrack combines ambient sound recorded in the Conservatory with a performance of a Samuel Barber composition, featuring Lucy Goeres on flute and Eliza Garth on piano.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zUlv4XN00XToXjDvhLHu0EvR6ZC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
