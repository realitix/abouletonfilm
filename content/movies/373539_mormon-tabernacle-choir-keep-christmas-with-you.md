Fontana makes his entrance on this beautifully produced show in a hot air balloon surrounded by large toy airplanes that drop from the ceiling as the Choir opens with the number \"The Candyman/Pocketful of Miracles.\" Other standout moments are a duet with the Count and the Choir's organist, Richard Elliott, to the tune of \"The Twelve Days of Christmas,\" a medley of songs from Sesame Street\u00ae as well as the popular \"Keep Christmas With You,\" and hilarious hijinks and banter from the Muppets\u00ae from Sesame Street\u00ae throughout the show. This show is a world-class performance perfect for all ages as you celebrate the Christmas holiday.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/njiYxHJiFAh0cAyOx7cj8L4Qwg8.jpg", "actors": ["Muppets From Sesame Street ()", "Santino Fontana (Santino Fontana)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "yMV04cziBh8"}
