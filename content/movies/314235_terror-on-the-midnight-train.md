The \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d-ish plot centres around middle-aged and balding station master Ruben, who is plagued by the vision of ghostly train. The train is always arriving at midnight to the accompaniment of eerie music whenever somebody in town has died. Swearing local priest Don Carmelo is skeptical. The main performance of Rafael Hernandez is competent and there is a bit of soft nudity provided by lovely Mari Paz Pondal.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eCFEVwot76nX2qPoCQ9KUewbBWs.jpg", "actors": ["Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez (Rub\u00e9n)", "Mary Paz Pondal (Rosa)", "Jos\u00e9 Riesgo (Don Carmelo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
