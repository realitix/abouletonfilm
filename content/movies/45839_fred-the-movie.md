However, the sheer fact that this movie exists in the first place and I am able to be here talking about it at all Is very commendable. It fits in the so bad it\u2019s good catagory with movies like \u2018The Room\u2019 as it doesn\u2019t have sheer incompetence, it has a decent story about a loser boy with mental issues stalking a woman. It\u2019s got a beginning, a middle, and an end. Also, John Cena being in this movie makes it better than it has any right to be. \r\n\r\nMy Score: 59%\r\n\r\nAverage Score: 0%"}], "recommandations_id": [84564, 128542, 33871, 252739]}
