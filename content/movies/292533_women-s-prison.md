In the early years, Mitra is repeatedly punished as the warden tries to break her. This includes punishment for delivering a baby in the prison cell while all of the prison staff has taken shelter during an Iraqi bombing. The warden's attitude starts to change after 8 years, when Mitra tries to protect a new inmate from rape at the hands of her older cellmates. When the baby comes back in 1991 as a 17 year old delinquent, Sepideh, the warden respects Mitra enough to protect the girl.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tbvXFYlDqTzkzoXklHiHDnLsfVH.jpg", "actors": ["Roya Nonahali (Mitra)", "Roya Taymourian (Warden)", "Pegah Ahangarani (Sepideh)", "Golab Adineh ()", "Maryam Boubani ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
