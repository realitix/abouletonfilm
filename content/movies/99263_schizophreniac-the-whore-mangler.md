Insanity is calling and Harry Russo is more than happy to answer by slicing, dicing, filleting and splaying anyone who gets in the way of his quest to achieve a state of complete mental chaos. Harry is not alone on his journey of destruction though, and as his villainous ventriloquist dummy offering a bit of immoral support, the stage is set for some serious bloodletting.~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jppPYa1rrHbA9q7jiw7v8OPxQk4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
