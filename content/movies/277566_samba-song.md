He dreams of making a professional movie, and starts shooting in 35mm. But as his budget begins to fade, he changes to Black-and-White, then gradually down to 16mm, Super-8 and, in the end, to his despair, to the video format. With the help of Edna Marla, producer who is searching for the Holy Grail of a genuinely 100% Brazilian celluloid; Dona Mart\u00edrio, his mother, former left-wing activist; Guar\u00e1 Rodrigues, an underground Brazilian movie star; and Lila Lessa, who stars in a 6 p.m. soap opera, they develop strategies and outlandish plans to win the insane battle of filmmaking in Brazil.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rnlPosERCtX9LzCTPmwT2s71DEV.jpg", "actors": ["Teuda Bara ()", "Nivaldo Pedrosa ()", "Jos\u00e9 Mojica Marins ()", "Yara de Novaes ()", "Carolina Duarte ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
