She finds herself torn between a former boyfriend who's the tough, insensitive-but-sexy, type, and a new acquaintance who's more sensitive to her feelings, but who still acts childishly selfish at times. Will she choose one of them, or decide to go her own way?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qrPFzUSx6RKlNCZjAMMFLFWkQPL.jpg", "actors": ["Kaori Momoi (Mariko)", "Eiji Okuda (Hashimoto)", "Leo Morimoto (Tsuneo)", "Juzo Itami (Takamizawa - Landlord)", "Sakura Kamo (Tokiko)", "Akemi Negishi (Mariko,s mother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
