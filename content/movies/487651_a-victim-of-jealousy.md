Even the minister, who performed their marriage ceremony, making a pastoral call annoys him. They attend a social gathering, and his ill-concealed perturbation at his young wife's affability with all present spoils her evening's pleasure, and finally induces her to ask to be taken home. Arriving home, a stormy scene ensues, and there might have been a separation but for the wife's subtleness in placing within his range delicate reminders of her own gentleness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kuPnbACtSISmKUuITEbU8Z5b5EB.jpg", "actors": ["James Kirkwood (The Husband)", "Florence Barker (The Wife)", "Mary Pickford (The Wife's Friend)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
