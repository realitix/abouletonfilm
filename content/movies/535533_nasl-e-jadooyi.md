He possesses a supernatural sense of hearing, so strong he can hear through solid walls and over great distances. But Babak is not the only one with bizarre, unexplained powers. A group of extraordinary individuals begin to emerge and find each other. Will they learn to use their powers for anything other than their own selfish means?
