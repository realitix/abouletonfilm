In turn, the elderly answer through their stories, which are basically the story of the town. And like the word \u2013which is always a fiction\u2013 builds a reality, the film sustains its tone on that intermediate area in which a fictional setting provides the conditions for the pure documentary genre to mark the pace and reach out to people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7pb8Cir7I84m5k48PXfegbCDlZj.jpg", "actors": ["Eva Bianco ()", "Mara Santucho ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
