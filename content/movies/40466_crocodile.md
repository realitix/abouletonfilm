To be expected in such a scenario the youths \"party\" and cuss a lot, so stay away if either offends you.\r\n\r\n\"Crocodile\" was directed by Tobe Hooper, the hallowed director of the acclaimed \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" (1974). I'm not a big fan of \"Texas\" (although I don't hate it either) and feel \"Crocodile\" is a more entertaining effort. These movies shouldn\u2019t really be compared, however, since \u201cTexas\u201d is serious slasher horror whereas \u201cCrocodile\u201d was made to be more amusing.\r\n\r\nThere's a fake-looking CGI scene in the final act depicting the crocodile jumping over a boat that doesn't work at all, not to mention, it was highly unbelievable (of course, the WHOLE film is unbelievable, huh?). Other than that the F/X are fine for Grade B horror; in fact, the creature looks superb.\r\n\r\n\"Crocodile\" may not be great cinema but it's got loads of energy and is amusing creature feature entertainment. Anyone watching a flick called \"Crocodile\" knows up front that it ain\u2019t gonna be \"Apocalypse Now.\" It's just a fun, re-watchable creature-on-the-loose flick highlighted by some curvy cuties: Sommer Knight as the stunning Sunny, Julie Mintz as the classy Annabelle and Caitlin Martin as the intelligent Claire. On the other side of the gender spectrum, Mark McLachlan stands out as the Tom Cruise-ish protagonist, Brady, and Chris Solari as the foil, Duncan. For comparison, \"Crocodile\" is overall way more entertaining than 1999's \"Lake Placid\" and superior to 1980\u2019s \u201cAlligator.\u201d It\u2019s easily one of the best crocogator flicks.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 93 minutes and was shot at Lake Piru & Sable Ranch in Northern Los Angeles County and Ciudad Obregon, Sonora, Mexico.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"}], "recommandations_id": [39862, 42187, 16205, 69270], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
