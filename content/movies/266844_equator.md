Sometimes described as frustrating and self-centered, reactions to this film swing across a broad spectrum of complaints -- not the least might be whether or not Gainsbourg is using a clich\u00e9d and stereotypical view of \"dark Africa\" to convey what he sees in his characters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s9z9UWmaEA20CnjQISgZ47rRnhV.jpg", "actors": ["Francis Huster ()", "Barbara Sukowa ()", "Reinhard Kolldehoff ()", "Jean Bouise ()", "Julien Guiomar ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
