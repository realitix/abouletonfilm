It's only a matter of time before the army of creatures attacks the rest of civilization and wreaks havoc upon the world. At dusk, a beat-up truck containing a rag-tag team of hardened mercenaries rolls into town, and this is not the first time they've been called in to exterminate; they are part of a secret society that has been operating outside of the government and the public eye for thousands of years. Their mission is to keep our world safe from evil-of our own creation and from beyond.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6fkfJNIH4yus8ex53882gYmsiX0.jpg", "actors": ["Chris Bell ()", "Benjamin Budd ()", "Tylan Canady ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
