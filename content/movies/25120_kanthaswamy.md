During a CBI income tax raid, he discovers a stash of black money owned by Ponnusamy (played by Ashish Vidyarthi), a rich and corrupted entrepreneur. Ponnusamy pretends to be paralysed to escape the questioning. Angered by the news that her father is paralysed, Ponnusamy's daughter, Subbulakshmi (played by Shriya Saran) goes after Kanthasamy to seek revenge by pretending to be in love with him. Kanthasamy, knowing Subbulakshmi's real intentions plays along in the game. This forms a cat and mouse chase between the two.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iglJvWYlHE8eFZTewFJIyGUI0Mt.jpg", "actors": ["Vikram (Kandasamy)", "Shriya Saran (Subbulakshmi)", "Prabhu Ganesan (Parandhaman)", "Vadivelu (Thengakadai Thenappan)", "Ashish Vidhyarthi (Pallur Paramajyothi Ponnusamy)", "Mansoor Ali Khan (Corrupt inspector)", "Mumaith Khan (Meenakumari)", "Mukesh Tiwari (Rajmohan)", "Y.
