Once, again, Brown is teamed with Raymond Hatton, but something new has been added. Max Terhune plays Hatton's comic foil, travelling under the same character name-\"Alibi\"-that he used when costarring in Monogram's \"Range Busters\" series. Terhune's bucolic routines did little to enliven the proceedings, but at least his presence injected some novelty value in the fading Brown series. Two films later, Raymond Hatton had left the fold, and Johnny Mack Brown was reteamed with Max Terhune for an additional three entries.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8QLzkCnQP3jl96m7vJCVjSP94gf.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Mack Brown (Sheriff Johnny Mack Brown)", "Raymond Hatton (Banty Prentiss)", "Max Terhune ('Alibi')", "Evelyn Finley (Nan Prentiss)", "Bill Kennedy (Barry Stuart)", "George J.
