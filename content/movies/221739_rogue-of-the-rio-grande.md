Seth rushes to the cantina where Sheriff Rankin is drinking, and the sheriff posts a reward for the capture of El Malo. El Malo informs his men of the reward. The bandit and his sidekick, Pedro, visit the cantina where Pedro resumes a former acquaintance with Dolores, while El Malo has his attention directed to a tango being performed by Carmita. El Malo pushes her dancing partner aside and finishes the dance with Carmita. Since Seth's description of him is not accurate, El May visits the sheriff and promises to deliver the wanted bandit to the cantina the following night. THe following morning, El Malo and Pedro depart, and, halting their horses on a hill, view the stagecoach being held up by a trio of outlaws.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7rYPkCed4CB73X1GxkEfiabacJm.jpg", "actors": ["Myrna Loy (Carmita)", "Walter Miller (Walter Miller)", "Carmelita Geraghty (Dolores)", "Gene Morgan (Mayor Seth Landport)", "Raymond Hatton (Pedro)", "William P.
