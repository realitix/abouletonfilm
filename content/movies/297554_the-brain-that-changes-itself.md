In The Brain That Changes Itself, Dr Norman Doidge explores the profound implications of the changing brain in a way that will permanently alter the way we look at human possibility and human nature.  The documentary examines a blind man who sinks a basketball; a woman with half a brain who leads a normal life; learning disorders, strokes and brain traumas that are improved and cured; and chronic pain that is alleviated. The vast expanse of the brain's possibility is still unrealized.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9tf704zqblURIzfiPjsw27tIjez.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
