He's having a limp and is regarded by the other kids as a strange loner with no friends, except for the village blacksmith Bj\u00f6rn who's taken care of him since Halvdan's father left on a plundering trip. Across the mighty river there's an enemy village that has been in a feud with Halvdan's tribe for as long as anyone can remember. One day during Halvdan's lonely excursions to the river he encounters Meia, the daughter of the enemy village ruler. A heart-warming and funny family adventure about bridging differences and forbidden friendship unfolds", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eKGvGpaQa0vzf9L9DG7dbY8sxFs.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Haber (Bj\u00f6rn)", "Torkel Petersson (Ragnar)", "Ellinea Siambalis (Meia)", "Vilgot Hedtj\u00e4rn (Halvdan)", "Claes M\u00e5nsson (Espen)", "Jimmy Lindstr\u00f6m (Grimulf)", "Nina Zanjani (Kristina)", "Joel Spira (Alarik)", "Ellen Jelinek (Frida)", "Frederik Nilsson (The Monk)", "Klas Wiljerg\u00e5rd (Sven)", "\u00c5sa-Lena Hjelm (Ragnhild)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
