Although only two were produced, and one was destroyed in an accident, the Valkyrie built an impressive databank of high-speed flight invaluable to aviation development. This DVD, with nearly 4 hours of rare footage of the XB-70, newly transferred on modern telecines, brings you the flight test program of the XB-70 as never before. Contains rare progress reports, footage from rollout, extensive footage of test flights, and footage from the A/V-2 accident. All footage is color. Some footage is silent.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6DlvPtqYjut3Ye6OXv2CeYjhGwu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
