It is the same scene and almost the exact same dialogue, except that it was made by real skydivers a few years before Fandango was produced. The character names are the same and you can clearly see that they took this film and created Fandango around it.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
