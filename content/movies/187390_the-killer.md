The killer happens to be Hsieh Chun (aka Hsiao Hu) who left town ten years ago. (When Hsieh Chun opens up a suitcase full of knives, you know that there is going to be tons of killing!). Thinking that the local kung fu school is bad, he goes over there to fight them. There is some reuniting of lost friends and some love between two of them. The bad guys are constantly double crossing everyone and this leads to total mayhem and carnage. The final fight scene (which is actually several fight scenes going from one to the next) is incredible, especially the blood soaked finale between the evil Japanese leader of the opium ring and the two brothers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pMx7jN82APdNqcNIG2Niiin87mQ.jpg", "actors": ["Chin Han (Inspector Ma)", "Chung Wah (Hsieh Chun/Hsiao Hu)", "Wang Ping (Yu Chiao/Xiao Mei)", "Cheng Miu (Master Wang Hsin-Tien)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
