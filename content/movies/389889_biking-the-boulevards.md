The boulevards are wide, tree-lined streets, which connect Chicago's largest parks. This system of parks and boulevards was the first of its kind in the country - imagined nearly 150 years ago. Discover how these boulevards came to be and explore these magnificent parks, from Washington and Sherman Parks on the South Side, to Douglas, Humboldt and Garfield on the West. These green spaces are often overlooked, but they're every bit as beautiful as Chicago's famous lakefront parks.  Geoffrey invites you to take a new look at the old neighborhoods that emerged along these boulevards in the 19th Century. Places like Bronzeville, Englewood, Back of the Yards, Lawndale, Humboldt Park, and Logan Square. Many of these enclaves have seen their share of hard times over the years, but hidden just beneath the surface\u2026you'll find some remarkable surprises.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2rUGPzg7TxL5Lerugnw7bZpQDxS.jpg", "actors": ["Geoffrey Baer (Himself / Presenter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
