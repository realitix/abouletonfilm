Surprisingly they consisted of 19 separate film rolls of censored violent and sexually explicit scenes. Non-Consensual Act (in progress) proposes to re-edit and recontextualise this material and in doing so it reflects on the representation of intimacy, violence, and gender discrimination and its cultural significances.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hSnmQsogO2axSVPCIZ8RpqB3osi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
