Whenever something \"improper\" does happen, Clara's way of handling it is simply to shove it under the carpet and ignore it completely, as if it never happened. 3 basic rules, are, of course: 1. Never marry some one \"under\" your class (Or the class you think you are). 2. Never become pregnant out of wedlock and 3. No Abortions. As one may expect, everything crumbles when her niece gives her no option, but to break at least one of those rules", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7Z9IjJNrsSw5xXIS3tb37FtprZ2.jpg", "actors": ["Hanna Maron (Clara)", "Ruth Segal (Leah)", "Yosef Carmon ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
