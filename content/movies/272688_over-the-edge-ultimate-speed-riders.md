It's a week full of high-altitude rides, evenings relaxing with friends and testing their skills against other extreme athletes, such as Fred Fugen and Vincent Reffet, also both speed-riders, and Thibaud Duchosal, a professional off-piste skier. Thibaud never uses a parachute so J\u00e9r\u00f4me and Fran\u00e7ois decide to design a system to take him up in the air with them and release him over previously inaccessible slopes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t4FtsBIqmXbiJ2dYTnLU29HqYOV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
