Once on shore, they make the acquaintance of a like-minded young widow who begins an affair with both men (she just wants to have a child by each) -- but their unusually idyllic existence is threatened with imminent tragedy as the French army advances ever closer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jtNB7LNCJZ4QEhjiFlAnNSkfJh1.jpg", "actors": ["Marcel Bozzuffi (Rouchon)", "Mick Ford (Chapin)", "Catherine Lachens (Catherine)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
