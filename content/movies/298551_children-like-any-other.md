Through their stories the film tries to give a picture of youngsters who live in the war for three and a half years and their efforts to overcome the trauma. The stories are seemingly separate, but the thread that connects them is a three-year-old boy who on his tricycle constantly wanders the streets of Sarajevo, passing everywhere and always seeing everything. He takes us from one child to another, opening up before us a picture of the bizarre life of children in Sarajevo.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bR292OqBrkD6T4bCnhlvrxB8Qpz.jpg", "actors": ["Adis Hasi\u0107 ()", "Jasena Had\u017eovi\u0107 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
