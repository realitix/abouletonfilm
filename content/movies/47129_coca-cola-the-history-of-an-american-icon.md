Much of this fluid was produced by one Atlanta-based company, and Coca-Cola: The History of an American Icon offers a panegyric to the Real Thing. The history of Coke is the history of its advertising, and this documentary draws on a rich archive of print, film, and television material to show how John Pemberton's soda recipe became such a potent symbol of American society. Coca-Cola: The History of an American Icon is, unsurprisingly, a one-sided history. There is no suggestion that the Coca-Colonization of the planet might have a downside, and lines like \"If the world's having a bad time, it's OK because there's still Coke\" are delivered without a hint of irony. Nevertheless, this documentary offers some fascinating insights into the history of Coca-Cola.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dQSyzkdc5QPlle2siE0KcPUfaP1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
