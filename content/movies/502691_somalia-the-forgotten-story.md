It addresses problems of civil war, chaos, theft, and mass destruction. It also focuses on valuable attempts by national organizations to resist occupation and foster peace.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2rwSKDqDqR3P7wI0EgjXZBmQK5M.jpg", "actors": ["Abukar Awale (Himself)", "Hussein Dualeh (Himself)", "Mohamed Hashi Elmi (Himself)", "Mary Harper (Herself)", "Nicholas Kay (Himself)", "Hassan Sheikh Mohamoud (Himself)", "Abdi Samater (Himself)", "Jon Snow (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
