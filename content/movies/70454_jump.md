The story is about an ordinary salary man, Junosuke, and his search for his lover, Miharu, who disappeared one night when she handed him the key to her room, and promised to be back in five minutes. She had only gone out to buy apples at the nearby convenience store, because Junosuke had it for breakfast every morning. Slightly drunk from the cocktail he had had earlier, Junosuke falls asleep, and wakes up the next morning to find that Miharu had never returned.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lyQV5ynXztl3EbxIgd3yEo3yhqB.jpg", "actors": ["Taizo Harada (Jun-nosuke Mitani)", "Y\u00fbko Fueki (Miharu Nagumo)", "Riho Makise (Sanae Suzunoki)", "Ken Mitsuishi (Matsunaga)", "Sawa Suzuki (Miyuki Amagasa)", "Masat\u014d Ibu (Koichi Enoki)", "Eve Masatoh (Koichi Enohata)", "Kumija Kim ()", "Daikichi Sugawara ()", "Natsuko Akiyama ()", "Susumu Terajima ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
