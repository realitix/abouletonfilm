Colourful Youth remains the only contemporary film to feature both of them. Filmed in Eastmancolor, the song-and-dance spectacle keeps its fingers on the pulse of its era and presents the vigour of the modern times.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1dnhXDZzFFa8bQs1YuZUm0pSRFM.jpg", "actors": ["Josephine Siao ()", "Connie Chan Po-Chu ()", "Wu Fung ()", "Stephen C.
