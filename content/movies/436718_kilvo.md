I wanted to know what the place looked like that inspired the music, so I went online and found all these old postcards and I started collecting them. I reduced the postcards to lines to emphasize the two-dimensionality of the represented landscape. I wanted the final videoimage to look like a postcard, so I divided it in 4 parts and generated every image on a black, a gray and a white background. Each beat of the bassdrum moved the images to the next quarter and I made an arrangement so that each quarter had to move in every three colors and in every possible direction. So in the end it became this very dynamic, animated postcard.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zquRIbhkfhedLtfoiyxJZEMSTZA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
