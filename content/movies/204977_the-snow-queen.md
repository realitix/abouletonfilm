The visual point of departure is fashioned by d\u00e9coupages created by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, who is also the narrator. The d\u00e9coupages serve to establish the mood around the story of the children, Kaj and Gerda. They consist of a countless number of clippings, which are subsequently subjected to the processes of computer animation and mixed with graphics, live actors and music into an unique fairy tale universe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vIHtHLhyYLsJUUSzQWzytW1xN9L.jpg", "actors": ["Margrethe II of Denmark (Narrator)", "Ronja Mannov Olesen (Gerda)", "Christian Elmelund (Kay)", "Nathia Petersen (The Gypsy Girl)", "Esther Knudsen (The Grandmother)", "Birthe B\u00f8gelund ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
