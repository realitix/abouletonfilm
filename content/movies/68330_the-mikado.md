He lights upon Nanki-Poo, a strolling minstrel who loves the beautiful Yum-Yum. But Yum-Yum is also loved by Ko-Ko, and Nanki-Poo, seeing no hope for his love, considers suicide. Ko-Ko offers to solve both their problems by executing Nanki-Poo, and an agreement is reached whereby Ko-Ko will allow Nanki-Poo to marry Yum-Yum for one month, at the end of which Nanki-Poo will be executed, in time for the arrival of the Mikado. But what Ko-Ko doesn't know is that Nanki-Poo is the son of the Mikado and has run away to avoid a betrothal to an old harridan named Katisha. The arrival of the Mikado brings all the threads of the tale together.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dweHbEtnPpqQKco2bayLlnYcjCS.jpg", "actors": ["Jon English (Poo-Bah)", "Derek Metzger (Nanki-Poo)", "Drew Forsythe (Ko-Ko)", "Bev Shean (Katisha)", "Terri Crouch (Yum-Yum)", "Georgia Duder (Pitti Sing)", "Andi Gallaher (Peep Bo)", "Lisa McArdle (Yo-Ko)", "David Gould (The Mikado of Japan)", "Christophe Broadway (Pish-Tush)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
