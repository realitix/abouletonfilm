Although the film is not set in any specified period, Gance wanted it to be seen as relevant to the contemporary situation in France. He wrote, \"...La V\u00e9nus aveugle is at the crossroads of reality and legend... The heroine ... gradually sinks deeper and deeper into despair. Only when she has reached the bottom of the abyss does she encounter the smile of Providence that life reserves for those who have faith in it, and she can then go serenely back up the slope towards happiness. If I have been able to show in this film that elevated feelings are the only force that can triumph over Fate, then my efforts will not have been in vain.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xBx7YMPXUoW3u2tAPflnOogNGKF.jpg", "actors": ["Viviane Romance (Clarisse)", "Georges Flamant (Mad\u00e8re)", "Henri Guisol (Ulysse)", "Lucienne Le Marchand (Gis\u00e8le)", "Jean Aquistapace (Indigo)", "Mary-Lou (Mireille)", "Adrien Caillard ()", "Philippe Grey (L'officier)", "G\u00e9rard Landry (Gazul)", "G\u00e9o Lecomte (Le quartier-ma\u00eetre)", "Marion Malville (Marceline)", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Martial (Un ami)", "Jean-Jack Meccati (L'admirateur)", "Marcel Millet (Goutare)", "Micheline Promeyrat ()", "Roland P\u00e9gurier (Le mousse)", "Marc Raymondun ()", "Ren\u00e9e Reney (La chanteuse)", "Rocca (Le chanteur)", "Georges T\u00e9rof (Un ami)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
