We follow him 24 hours before his parole and 48 hours after his release. We get to see his experiences in prison and his relationship with his mother, friends and girlfriend Kari. Just like Bj\u00f8rneboe's novel, the movie is a critical note to the debate how society took care of youth on the edge during the 50s and 60s.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/foBOuCz0KkbzENrywz82zjcOUao.jpg", "actors": ["Per Christensen (Tonny)", "Wenche Foss (Tonnys mor)", "Liv Ullmann (Kari)", "Gisle Straume ()", "Henny Skj\u00f8nberg (Dame med parasoll)", "Lalla Carlsen (Avisbud)", "Joachim Calmeyer (R\u00f8rleggeren)", "Rolf Daleng (Alfred)", "Finn Kvalem (R\u00f8dtopp)", "Ola B.
