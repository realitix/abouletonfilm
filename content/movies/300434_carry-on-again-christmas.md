The writing never quite builds up any steam, and many of the jokes were recycled from previous films anyhow.  This special was filmed in black and white -- strangely, since the previous one was in color. I generally love the look of black and white, and the earliest films in the Carry On series do fine with it. But here it is used ineffectively and feels like a budgetary concession, which I'm sure it was.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u8muER4pHNG27Gi3Hy0a7Og46NN.jpg", "actors": ["Sid James (Long John Sil)", "Terry Scott (Squire Treyhornay)", "Charles Hawtrey (Old Blind Pew, Night Watchman, Nipper the Flipper)", "Charles Hawtrey (Dr Livershake)", "Barbara Windsor (Jim Hawkins)", "Bernard Bresslaw (Rollicky Bill)", "Bob Todd (Ben Gunn, Ship Mate)", "Wendy Richard (Kate)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
