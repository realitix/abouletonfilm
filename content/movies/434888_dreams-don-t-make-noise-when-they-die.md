He plays an old peasant who on his deathbed is waiting for his son (Jon Bang Carlsen). In a few days he relives the village life, he comes from, and which was marked by a hard and authoritarian upbringing. He is at his father's deathbed despair because it is still impossible to make contact, and in a crisis situation, he recognizes his father's brutality in itself. The film draws a bitter picture of human relationships where dreams while they die, degenerates into power relations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jqfnUetdMyJnIUECOsGdvVyAgOH.jpg", "actors": ["Kai Holm (Kresten, Eriks far)", "Karl Stegger (Hurtig-Karl)", "Jon Bang Carlsen (Erik, politiker)", "Irm Hermann (Margit, Eriks kone)", "Holger Nederby (Ras)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
