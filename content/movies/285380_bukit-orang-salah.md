Unlike its neighbouring islands, however, St. John's was never fully developed. It occupies an in-between space, the vestiges of its history scattered around the land. Its indeterminacy stands in sharp contrast to Singapore, where land use is meticulously planned to fulfil economic and social functions. In this film, St. John's Island - otherwise known as 'Bukit Orang Salah', a nickname coined by the people who were quarantined there - becomes a site of and for reflection, prompting questions about our history, heritage and identity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tD3wqiAdkALCRwy3vK3xCi6bJwS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
