The documentary raises questions about identity, assimilation, and diversity and explores how the adaptation process differs from one ethnic group to another, from one individual to the next.  Welcome to Vermont is an intimate portrait of communities grappling to re-frame their identities as they strive to build their lives in America.  By sharing the stories featured in the film, Welcome to Vermont aims to engage the general public, educators, and students in a humanistic dialogue about diversity and tolerance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hre8nrXfdHQ5KHBKlgtxClfHWbg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
