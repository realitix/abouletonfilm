Enough action to overload anybody's circuits. There is enough sex to go around for nearly everybody in the Manhattan directory. A wild party at the home of a crusty millionaire brings the characters together. The first catch of the day adds a hot Latin touch to the French-maid category. New Year's Eve day starts with rich old Mr. Luther seducing his maid D'Arcy. The action switches to Artie, peering through his binoculars at long legged exhibitionist Zelda when his wife, Gracie, catches him. He must be out of his mind to ignore such a foxy wife, and she storms out looking for a one hour stand", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bxpQt8BTogOfKEbLLb41vm3uoF3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
