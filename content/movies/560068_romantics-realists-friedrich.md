He then moved to Dresden, Germany. Friedrich painted numerous breathtaking German landscapes featuring morning mists, rolling hills, harbors, and other natural wonders. \"Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog\" is one of his most beautiful paintings. A number of his works are said to be expressions of religious mysticism, including \"The Cross in the Mountains.\" Friedrich would often incorporate crosses and other Christian symbols in his paintings in an effort to express his religious views. Some art experts believe that Friedrich's paintings often contain deeply imbedded religious commentary. For example, his painting of a ruined abbey in the snow (\"Abbey with Oak Trees\") is thought by some to be a statement by Friedrich about the Reformation's impact on earlier religious beliefs and practices.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rSzou9BpGoTExlnRcEtLuxCMNpF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
