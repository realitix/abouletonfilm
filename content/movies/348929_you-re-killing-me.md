George thinks that his boyfriend, Joe, is hilarious... and he just saw Patricia Arquette at Target!!! In the horror/comedy hybrid, 'You're Killing Me', we take a look at the life and death consequences of dating in the age of incessant chatter. Joe and George meet just as Joe is coming out to himself as someone who loves to kill. George, on the other hand, can't decide which wig to wear for his next YouTube video. As George's friends start disappearing, one by one, he must face the undeniable fact that Gretchen might not be coming back with crushed ice for his party #YouDontNeedIceForChardonnay.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qNr6mDgWJ8GxbULy14MQSXKaFQ9.jpg", "actors": ["Jeffery Self (George)", "Drew Droege (Cameron)", "Mindy Cohn (Karen)", "Carolyn Hennesy (Candice)", "Bryan Safi (Barnes)", "Jack Plotnick (Louis)", "Sam Pancake (Dr. Strauss)", "Edi Patterson (Emma)", "Matthew Wilkas (Andy)", "Matthew McKelligon (Joe)", "Shaughn Buchholz (Oli)", "Rachel Shukert (Gretchen)", "James Cerne (Teddy)", "Christian Olguin (Mark)", "Bridgid Ryan (Elsa)", "Ranney Draper (Joe Palmer, Sr.)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [122329, 251689, 27234], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
