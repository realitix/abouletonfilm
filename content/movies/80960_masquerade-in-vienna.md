This muff however belongs to Anita Keller, in secret the painter's lover but also the fianc\u00e9e of the court orchestra director Paul Harrandt.  The picture is then published in the newspaper. When Paul sees it and asks von Heidenick some questions about the identity of the model, the artist is forced to improvise a story and on the spur of the moment invents a woman called Leopoldine Dur as the alleged model. Leopoldine Dur however turns out to be a real woman whose acquaintance Heidenick makes shortly afterwards.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bcqLkTIXgVEADkneorIWKfCDNCz.jpg", "actors": ["Paula Wessely (Leopoldine Dur)", "Adolf Wohlbr\u00fcck (Der Zeichner Heideneck)", "Peter Petersen (Professor Carl Ludwig Harrandt)", "Walter Janssen (Paul Harrandt, Hofopernkapellmeister)", "Olga Tschechowa (Anita Keller - die Braut des Einen)", "Hilde von Stolz (Gerda - die Frau des Anderen)", "Julia Serda (Die F\u00fcrstin M.)", "Hans Moser (Zacharias, der G\u00e4rtner)", "Fritz Imhoff ()", "Poldi Dur ()", "Grete Natzler ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "whNTaoexuw4"}
