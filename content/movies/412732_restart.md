Let\u2019s be clear from the start: \u201cRESTART\u201d is frightfully beautiful, unsettling, and enticing all at once, and it thereby hits a nerve with our contemporary desires and fears without having to become involved in the subconscious innocence-deal of a crisis that has apparently affected us as unexpectedly as only a sudden extraterrestrial comet impact could.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/peRLhRPRVGu5vfmhr30gsCsY2fg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
