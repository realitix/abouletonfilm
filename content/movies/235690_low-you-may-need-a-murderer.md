Famous for their quiet, beautiful slow songs, and fascinating harmonies, as well as their religious background (core members Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker are Mormons). For this documentary, a film crew followed Alan and Mimi on tour, at home in Duluth, MN, in their church community, and as parents. It's more than an on-the-road or behind-the-scenes video. It shows Sparhawk as the ambivalent main character in an intriguing movie about religion, violence, conscience, and madness. It can also be seen as a touching love story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1KIRN3UVwF0OjnQlFiNyiSkYAGN.jpg", "actors": ["Alan Sparhawk ()", "Mimi Parker ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
