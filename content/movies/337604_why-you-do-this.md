Over the course of three years--and three tours--he interviews the groups he performs with and questions why they are following the same frustrating path. Struggling with the reality of working a nine-to-five job and the desire to be a full-time musician, he examines why he chose such an unpopular genre of music. As he tours with more successful bands he begins to uncover the true meaning of success and why these bands take such big risks. Includes interviews with Lamb of God, Gojira, Richard Christy and many more.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9bIUuUzSmysBBAlSpYBuChkpeUc.jpg", "actors": ["Randy Blythe (Himself - Lamb of God)", "Richard Christy (Himself - Death)", "Micah Consylman (Himself - Bella Morte)", "Chris Corey (Himself - Last Chance To Reason)", "Garret Dafferner (Christy)", "Michael Dafferner (Narrator)", "Andy Deane (Himself - Bella Morte)", "Bob Delaney (Himself - Last Chance To Reason)", "David Denio (Himself)", "Joe Duplantier (Himself - Gojira)", "Ben Falgoust II (Himself - Goatwhore)", "Elliot Hoffman (Himself - Car Bomb)", "David Kennedy (Himself)", "Greg Kubacki (Himself - Car Bomb)", "Tony Lechmanski (Tony Lechmanski - Bella Morte)", "Jon Modell (Himself - Car Bomb)", "Jim Quinlivan (Himself)", "Evan Sammons (Himself - Last Chance To Reason)", "Josh Scogin (Himself - The Chariot)", "Dennis Vanacore (Himself)", "Dan Vokey (Himself - The Chariot)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "wJSp-yRMrsY"}
