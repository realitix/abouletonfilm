Helmer/co-scripter Xie Fei\u2019s eye for colorful realism has always been stronger than his grasp of human drama, and this is no exception. Pic centers on a Tibetan woman, Yixizhuoma, and her turbulent marriage to a proud warrior type, Jiacuo, across half a century.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xJXaxmV3W5TfgamZj0Fm6hkW8g6.jpg", "actors": ["Danzengzhuoga (Yixizhuoma (Old))", "Laqiong (Yixizhuoma (Young))", "Dawangdui (Jiacuo (Old))", "Dunzhu Renqing (Jiacuo (Young))", "Dazhen (Yixizhuoma's Granddaughter)", "Cirenduoji ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
