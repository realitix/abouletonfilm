I can't be certain though, because I'd have to re-watch them all to make sure I'm not making a bad recommendation, and I'm not super keen on doing that seeing as this one and the one preceding it were both kinda... bad.\r\n\r\nThe mythology of _Insidious_ is something I am very interested in, and _The Last Key_ added it to it **somewhat**. But if this is the sort of quality we can expect from future instalments, then maybe we should never see the resolution of the same cliffhanger ending that they've given us for **the last three movies in a row**.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}], "recommandations_id": [280092, 91586, 396422, 416234], "youtube_key": "acQyrwQyCOk"}
