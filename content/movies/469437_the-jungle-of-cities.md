A police reporter, Nikos Avgeris, has the journalistic mission to cover a suspected car crash that killed a senior state official. His investigation reveals that the victim was responsible for the financial control of a large building organization and that he was being used to cover the illegality of his administration. This organization had abused much of the money earmarked for the erection of homes for homeless war wounded, and is now very much annoyed by the revelations of Augustus. This is why they try to close his mouth, but he is not hurt and continues the investigation. Augustus reaches the end, revealing everything and clearing up yet another dirty affair.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/guS5LFIxfDSshVZUF09mqiayeb1.jpg", "actors": ["Kostas Prekas (Nikos Avgeris)", "Mairi Hronopoulou (Nelli Rokou)", "Manos Katrakis (Lysias Sekeris)", "Spyros Kalogirou (Frantzis)", "Andreas Barkoulis (Stefanos Rokos)", "Notis Peryalis (Ektoras Damianos)", "Anna Paitatzi (Hristina)", "Labros Kotsiris (Stratos Stathatos)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
