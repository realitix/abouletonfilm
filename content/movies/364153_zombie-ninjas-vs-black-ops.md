ZOMBIE NINJAS. Trapped amongst unsuspecting civilians, including former tactical operative DILLON (Adam T Perkins), the ZOMBIE NINJAS commanded by a ferocious leader (Soa 'The Hulk' Palelei) are unleashed in the inner city high-rise. They soon face off with the covert response mission deployed to fight back. This elite black ops team underestimates the brutality of their encounter, which ultimately tests their loyalty and friendship, resulting in a frightful assault between these two highly skilled lethal forces and DILLON thrust in the middle fighting for survival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z9TvguHLqWuALBgCUZxgCnqRAk4.jpg", "actors": ["Korum Ellis (Eddie)", "Adam T Perkins (Dillion)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "bfp6umEpC2k"}
