A ten-year-old boy called Guido enters a Catholic seminary, fascinated by the idea of becoming a priest. He quickly understands that in order to be a good seminarian he has to submit to an ascetic and unnatural training, consisting in mortification of the flesh, obsession with sin and repression of one's sexual instincts and desires.

A system in which thinking for oneself is forbidden.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eeTHtjKDF9MTkCHGKTuc35yMqHX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [117825], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
