Having been chased around the world by the law, they have landed in New York. FBI agent Tass (Leslie Body) and a couple of comical Brooklyn cops he commandeers pursue them doggedly.  From the Mafias of Manhattan to the Mobs of Brooklyn, no one will protect the killers. Carving a path upstate, leaving a trail of bodies, they seal off a mountain resort and prepare for a final showdown.  Into this end game stumble a handful of staff counselors and a group of poachers. The tension rises and the bodies fall as Tass and Anton approach the climax atop one of the highest peaks in the Catskill mountains  With an original score by Roman and a soundtrack to make it kick by young artists including the Outsiders, Murder One Squad, Pappa LV, Raw Material, Pie Alamo, Storm Prod., Brother Makes 3, Jeff Levine, Steve Nuns and MC YT.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Spencer Ross (Anton)", "Leslie Body (Agent Tass)", "Christopher Macken (Rudy)", "Regina Watson (Cippio's Girlfriend)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
