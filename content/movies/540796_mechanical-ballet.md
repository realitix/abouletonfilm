Reworked into a two-screen film and divorced from their original context, they take on both a sinister and humorous quality. Mechanical Ballet was born out of an interest in \u2018found footage\u2019 film (in its relation to collage and assemblage) and the possibilities offered by the London Film-Makers\u2019 Co-op workshop in terms of manipulation of the filmstrip and the film frame, projection, duration and the film printing process.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
