Bill's roots in hardcore punk and thrash metal, combined with years of putting passion to work, forged a signature sound that would ultimately become the backbone of the sludgy, psychadelic and progressive riffs that are Mastodon.  In this honest and unflinching feature-length documentary, Bill reveals all that he has sacrificed to achieve his dreams - and what he learned from fifteen years on the road. From the lowest of lows, to international success as one of today's biggest metal bands, it's all here.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ap3gUgqL5cj7new0ed01pLVhc2t.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
