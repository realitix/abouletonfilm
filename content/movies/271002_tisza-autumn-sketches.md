Some villagers are stacking a bed of stone blocks on the river-bank to avoid more eroding. Others are occupied by ploughing, fishing or repairing. A small steamboat passes by. In the engine room a stoker is shovelling coal into the oven. Further down the river a small town is passed by the water. A rowing-team is training for coming races. Some biologists are looking at microbes from the water through a microscope. A group of workers are painting a new barge and push it into the river. When a small boy sees a racing boat, he leaves his sand-castle and runs along the river.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w26f9t5Y9sevYIXYOQWbZqE21sa.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
