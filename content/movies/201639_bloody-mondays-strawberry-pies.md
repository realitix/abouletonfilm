Beauty, love, work.. sometimes it just isn't worth getting out of bed. A girl in a strawberry pie factory, a stressed desert nomad, a Wall street stockbroker, the last living WW2 female spy, a painter who paints Time for 42 years, the first school shooter in history who wounded eleven children and killed two adults because: 'I don't like Mondays', are the characters in this film. John Malkovich gives voice to the inner bored human being. He crawls under your skin prompting questions: Howmany people in the world are like me?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1aPeuuLcxKG7aNafBSav9pE3euq.jpg", "actors": ["John Malkovich (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
