Druze policeman Salim Barakat quickly arrived on the scene and bravely eliminated him. However, he was killed by the terrorist. For ten years, Jamal, Salim's brother, has been attending annual police ceremonies in commemoration of his brother. Suspecting they may be withholding information, he decides to go on an investigative journey to find out who killed his brother.
