Recorded live in two sold-out shows in the middle of a thunderstorm, this is Ken's best performance yet! Ken's hilarious stories include, \"Strawberry Underwear\", the \"Kansas Cow\", \"Hurricane Man\", \"The Speeding Ticket\", \"Teenage Mutant Hotel Dwellers\" and a whole lot more! You'll laugh till your sides ache, and you'll be encouraged to live \"under the influence\". This is a bold declaration of Ken's faith. As always, the whole family will love this DVD.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ke9QpreFjUdi8uKNzwXMpimt7TE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
