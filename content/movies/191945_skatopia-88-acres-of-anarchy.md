Mad-Max style demolition derbies and spontaneous car burning accompany all-night skate sessions. Pain is a badge of honor. Tony Hawk calls Skatopia a \"rite of passage\" for hardcore skaters. Skatopia's owner, Brewce Martin, dreamed of a place where he could live and breathe skating... a place where people forget their \"outside\" lives by plunging into high-energy craziness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sUjxwcUS0KYnD5v1SIVMpOiKvfs.jpg", "actors": ["Brewce Martin (Himself)", "Duane Peters (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "bTgV44R_loU"}
