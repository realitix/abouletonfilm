As the musicians' story unfolds, the film also presents a cross-section of other Cuban and Latin American artists, resulting in an experience that's as entertaining to listen to as it is to watch.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
