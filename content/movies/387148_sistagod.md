Born to a white American soldier and a black Trinidadian woman, she is exposed to death at an early age, being conceived and growing up near a cemetery, and miraculously surviving after accidentally ingesting poison. At age eighteen, she dreams a premonition of the future, after which she realizes that she is the \"Messiah\". Her presence on Earth will herald an event known as the \"Apocalypso\" - the end of humanity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dB7Lmhc1SJVpihfuTYUjCyVktSy.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Cherrie (Father Divine)", "Evelyn Caesar-Munroe ()", "Yashmin Campagne ()", "Matthew McHugh ()", "Indigo Minerve ()", "Nicole Minerve ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
