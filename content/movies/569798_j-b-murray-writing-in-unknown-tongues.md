Murray (1908-1988) was a farmer who lived in rural Glascock County, Georgia, near the community of Mitchel. When he was approximately seventy years of age, believing he had experienced a vision from God, he began writing a non discursive script on adding machine tape, wall board, and stationery. He described it as \"the language of the Holy Spirit, direct from God\" and interpreted it using a bottle of water as a focusing device. In the last ten years of his life he made over a thousand paintings, introducing the script into fields of color and adding figures that represent \"the evil people; the ones that are dry tongued, the one's that don't know God\". Murray's works are exhibited throughout the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yn6DVaVPdG05oYREhajjldndLoV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
