First rapidly edited, the footage then slows down to focus on rows of houses, the street numbers on their fa\u00e7ades, and their mail slots. As 37th Av. & S.F. CA and many other elements about the US Post Office in this collection evidence, what seems to have fascinated Elam about the mail was the way it circulated within neighborhoods, from one house to the next, thereby connecting the people who lived in them together. At the end, one handwritten note reads: \u201cTo be looked at one frame at a time,\u201d some directions possibly referring to the following series of rapidly edited shots of nature and dogs running in a park.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
