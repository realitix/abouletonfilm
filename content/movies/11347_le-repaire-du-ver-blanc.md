These three and Eve\u2019s beau (Hugh Grant) soon stumble upon an ancient snake cult led by the eccentric Lady Sylvia Marsh (Amanda Donohoe), who dwells at a lavish estate nearby.\r\n\r\nThe movie is a creative and entertaining creature feature reminiscent in tone & theme of \u201cSquirm\u201d (1976), but with Russell\u2019s well-known offbeat excesses. The \u201ccreatures\u201d are vampire-like snake people plus a gigantic serpent at the close, both of which recall the snake worshipers & giant serpents from \u201cConan the Barbarian\u201d (1982).\r\n\r\nThere are some iconic cinematic images, like Donohoe as the vampiric snake lady, not to mention a few well done horror scenes, like a snake woman who\u2019s cut in half, but still wiggles with furious intent. \r\n\r\nThe snake cult is diabolical in an anti-Christ way and I can see why some viewers might find the movie shocking and offensive, like the weird nun-raping flashback. Yet everything's so exaggerated and sometimes cheesy with a bit o' humor thrown in that the film can't be taken very seriously, which negates it from being shocking or disturbing. Fun in a horrific way? Yes. Disturbing? No. Also, keep in mind that horror villains/monsters are SUPPOSED to drip with ee-vil and be shocking. The question is, do they win or do the noble protagonists win?\r\n\r\nOn the female front, the chief snake lady thinks she\u2019s hotter than she really is as Donohoe amusingly hams it up. Meanwhile Catherine Oxenberg as Eve is a semi-highlight, particularly in the last act.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 33 minutes and was shot entirely in England (Hertfordshire; Manifold Valley, Staffordshire; Peak District National Park; and Derbyshire). Thor's Cave in Manifold Valley is magnificent.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"}], "recommandations_id": [24274, 31596, 27495, 27381]}
