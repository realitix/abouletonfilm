He plays it in the streets, in the park, in the streetcar (at least when he does not miss it!). When he unfortunately walks under a piano clumsy removers are hauling, the heavy instrument falls down on him and he swallows his clarinet. A lot of people try to extirpate the protruding instrument but they all fail. Three farriers finally succeed in making him return to his former self.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oykrgrtMwZpUWTRMKp0f0Etq7jE.jpg", "actors": ["Ernest Serva\u00e8s (Arth\u00e8me)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
