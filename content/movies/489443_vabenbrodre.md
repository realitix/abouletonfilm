In spite of cultural differences, their men fight side by side to improve security in a region that has been torn up by war. However, when an Afghan officer turns his weapon against the Danish soldiers, the cooperation and growing friendship between the two leaders is put to the test. Before the men have time to react, the traitor vanishes leaving \u00d8rn wounded and his interpreter dead. \u00d8rn is shipped back to Denmark, but returns to Afghanistan as soon as he recovers from his wounds, determined to continue his duty as if nothing ever happened. Once again the Danish soldiers go on patrol with Fareed and his officers, but mistrust lurks just beneath the surface and it becomes increasingly difficult for \u00d8rn to not only to keep his men's paranoia at bay, but also his own.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sxVvzDu2xTmW1KIbm9aRfFtMCxS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
