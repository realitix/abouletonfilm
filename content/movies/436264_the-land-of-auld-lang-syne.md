We learn that religion, science and the arts are the most important thing here and we get to see various historic sites including Edinburgh Castle. The majority of this short comes off more like a history lesson of poet Robert Burns who is best remembered for \"Auld Lang Syne\", which we get to hear a part of at the end of the movie.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bxpMGe6jVrjlftBA2PXwYsHm9mi.jpg", "actors": ["James A.
