Written and directed by Christina Willings, Beauty explores the lives of five gender-creative kids, each uniquely engaged in shaping their ideas of what it means to be fully human. Claiming your own sense of gender when everything around you insists that you comply and conform can be challenging, and sometimes scary\u2014but family and friends are there to help.  Free-flowing animated elements, ranging from images of octopuses to astronauts, draw together the kids\u2019 shared experiences in beautifully rendered fantasias that celebrate the power of imagination and the flourishing force of self-determination. Playful, goofy, loving and brave, each of these remarkable young people\u2014including Ladner, B.C.\u2019s transgender advocate Tru Wilson\u2014have found their own way to break free and show the world what it really means to be your true self.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u5HY8G5hbsSb0tRZpQxa5pSj8Rl.jpg", "actors": ["Fox Kou Asano ()", "Bex Mosch ()", "Milo Santini-Kammer ()", "Lili Tepperman ()", "Tru Wilson ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "yr15bUXD8P0"}
