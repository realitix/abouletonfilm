During this time, a messianic prophecy arose in the countryside of an infant warrior that would be born that could overthrow the conquering Tang, heralded by a flying horse. Into this situation we meet a peasant, A Sadal, who we first discover stealing a Buddha statue from temple and stealing food from an old man dying of hunger. We then meet his wife, Sae Onyeo, and the happily married pair soon conceive and bear a child. However, reports of a flying horse abound and the Tang start a campaign to find the infant warrior, with potential consequences for the new parents in addition to the rest of their village.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Baek Il-seob (A Sadal)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
