How do we absorb and transform experiences that are funny, bewildering and beautiful \u2013 confusing, frightening or sad?  The stories are sentimental and comical, silly and serious. Two statues learn about friendship from identical twins dressed as curtains. A girl with a camera multiplies, disappearing with a flash into TV infinity. Static electricity haunts objects and we take a minute to think about walking up hills\u2026  Music, dance and gesture take over when words won\u2019t work. Small items grow huge and people shrink. The videos are set in a world where things follow a different logic \u2013 where they fit together as they do in dreams and in our heads.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wPKacGQKxZ12nyjQLVdHuboRHzA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
