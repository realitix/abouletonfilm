But what if those events were actually to take place THIS YEAR, in 2011?  In \u201cAwakening As One\u2019s\u201d new film \u201cThe Quickening\u201d we will explain why so many people have been experiencing the sensation that \u201cTime is Speeding Up\u201d; particularly since the Earthquake in Japan.  And we will also show how research indicates that this accelerated experience of reality could peak sometime around October 28th, 2011; culminating in a global experience of Unity Consciousness, which would then lead to the experience of a harmonious new way of being.  \u201cThe Quickening\u201d will also take a look at the unfolding of current events and how they directly relate to Hopi and Mayan Prophecies, indicating that we are on the Cusp of Great Changes, which signify the shifting of the Age\u2026 and the Birth of a New World.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xA5pWKNH1aBUZ7wJBajklvfADFv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
