Well, kind of. There is a plot of sorts, but this really is more of a compilation disc than anything else. There is plot for each scene, but it\u2019s never part of a cohesive whole. It\u2019s like watching the Club Massacre from the beginning of Blade, the boarding of the plane from Passenger 57, and the final inning from Major League on a Wesley Snipes compilation disc. Is there a plot? Sure, but you don\u2019t see much of it. I\u2019m just going to address the plots in the scene breakdown; it\u2019s really not worth it from here.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Ginger Lynn Allen ()", "Cynthia Brooks ()", "Dorothy Onan ()", "Ron Jeremy ()", "Tom Byron ()", "Paul Thomas ()", "Larry Harwood ()", "Blake Palmer ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
