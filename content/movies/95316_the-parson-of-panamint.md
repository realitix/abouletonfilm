Looming large in Chuckawalla's reminiscences is the day that young and apparently mild-mannerd minister Philip Pharo (Phillip Terry) rode into town. In his own gentle but forceful fashion, Pharo managed to bring the town's lawless element into line, mollify the local bluenoses, and win the heart of likeable dance-hall girl Mary Mallory (Ellen Drew).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w6QBVnmIzucUeUPo1o0TiIxPdP7.jpg", "actors": ["Charles Ruggles (Chuckawalla Bill Redfield)", "Ellen Drew (Mary Mallory)", "Phillip Terry (Rev.
