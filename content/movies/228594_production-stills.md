A perfectly enclosed narrative of its own production: the image is one long take (11 minutes) of a wall on which a hand sequentially pins a number of Polaroids, one after the other. The Polaroids depict the crew making the film; the synchronous sound allows us to hear in \u2018real time\u2019, their chatter and the hum of the still camera, so that we can anticipate the photos and assign faces to the voices we hear. - Artefact Festival", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tN38EaaeI9RuxgapcmKFAbFVgMZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
