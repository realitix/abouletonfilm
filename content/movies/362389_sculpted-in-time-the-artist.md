The viewer meets local visual artist Dan Hudson as he ruminates on the very mountains that define his lifestyle, and inspires his artistic expression.  The film tracks the artist as he shoots skiers and snowboarders on the mountain and then into his studio as nature becomes muse and inspiration flows both ways, translating to canvas.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Dan Hudson ()", "Kevin Hjertaas ()", "Keegan Capel ()", "Rauri MacFarlane ()", "Noah Maisonet ()", "Drew Wittstock ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
