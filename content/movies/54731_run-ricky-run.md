In 2004, with rumors of another positive marijuana test looming, the Miami Dolphins running back traded adulation and a mansion in South Florida for anonymity and a $7 a night tent in Australia. His decision created a media frenzy that dismantled his reputation and branded him as America's Pothead. But while most in the media thought Williams was ruining his life by leaving football, Ricky thought he was saving it. Through personal footage recorded with Williams during his time away from football and beyond, filmmaker Sean Pamphilon takes a fresh look at a player who had become a media punching bag and has since redeemed himself as a father and a teammate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8bi5zuV8FeD6bfqTcjaK7WVBouZ.jpg", "actors": ["Jim Brown (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [54689, 54743, 54739, 54744], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
