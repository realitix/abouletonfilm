In Hiro, Hawar finds a kindred spirit that like himself yearns for freedom and self-expression under a suppressive regime. Hiro's brother Shooresh supports Hawaar's underground activities and is sympathetic to Hawaar's feelings for his sister. But Hiro's cousin Houmayoun is also courting Hiro. He has long set his eye on the girl, and his dubious loyalties and secret dealings with the government put the three others, and all they aspire to, at risk. They set out to flee to neighboring Turkey, but the journey puts them in even more danger than they were in before.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
