To have a \"great night at the opera\" all efforts must succeed - orchestra, singers and concept. Here, conductor Fabio Luisi shapes an intensive Verdian sound and the singers are nothing short of possessed.  Excellent German bass Ren\u00e9 Pape in a small role of Banquo is luxury casting which few opera houses can afford.  Joseph Calleja's golden tenor in a role of Macduff shone and rang among dark and menacing voices of his colleagues.  And the principals, Zeljko Lucic and Anna Netrebko, gave us truly historical performance. Brilliant, nuanced and powerful singing from these two and the chemistry, interaction between them is what elevates this performance to the stratosphere of operatic Macbeths.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kxHM077MGPJEwYkO8xng4X5ouFm.jpg", "actors": ["\u017deljko Lu\u010di\u0107 (Macbeth)", "Anna Netrebko (Lady Macbeth)", "Ren\u00e9 Pape (Banco)", "Joseph Calleja (Macduff)", "Noah Baetge (Malcolm)", "James Courtney (Medico)", "Claudia Waite (Dama de Lady Macbeth)", "Richard Bernstein (Sicario)", "Seth Malkin (Heraldo)", "Fabio Luisi (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
