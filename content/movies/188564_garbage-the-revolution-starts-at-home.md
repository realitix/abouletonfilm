The Revolution Starts at Home is a feature documentary about how the family household has become one of the most ferocious environmental predators of our time.  Concerned for the future of his new baby boy Sebastian, writer and director Andrew Nisker takes an average urban family, the McDonalds, and asks them to keep every scrap of garbage that they create for three months. He then takes them on a journey to find out where it all goes and what it's doing to the world.  From organic waste to the stuff they flush down the potty, the plastic bags they use to the water they drink out of bottles, the air pollution they create when transporting the kids around, to using lights at Christmas, the McDonalds discover that for every action there is a reaction that affects them and the entire planet.  Everyday life under a microscope has never been so revealing. By the end of this trashy odyssey, you are truly inspired to revolutionaize your lifestyle for the sake of future generations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ejhIRJzzpu6nE9tTByR7ZIFGJYf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
