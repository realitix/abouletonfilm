Donald Woods plays an Irish immigrant who teams with Mexican gal Gloria Warren to combat land baron Anthony Warde. Whenever the plot lags, Warren sings. Catch the name of \"Renault Duncan\" in the screenplay credits of Bells of San Fernando. It's really actor Duncan Renaldo, aka \"The Cisco Kid\" -- which may explain why the film looks like a thinly disguised \"Cisco\" episode.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3ChGOHJf6Zd8VcUBO3uxVo2arjx.jpg", "actors": ["Donald Woods (Michael 'Gringo' O'Brien)", "Gloria Warren (Maria Garcia)", "Byron Foulger (Francisco Garcia, Mission Blacksmith)", "Shirley O'Hara (Nita)", "Anthony Warde (Juan Mendoza)", "Monte Blue (Governor Don Sebastian Fernando)", "Paul Newlan (Gueyon, Garcia's Assistant)", "David Leonard (Father Xavier)", "Gordon B.
