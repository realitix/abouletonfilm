It belongs to that little-known \"second wave\" of anti-drug films, the postwar scare stories about middle-class kids overcome by junkiedom. What this wave of films reveals is that drugs were an issue for white adolescents long before the psychedelic Sixties, and that the official response to the threat expressed a general, not specifically targeted paranoia.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["John Galvarro (Marty Malone)", "James Brill (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
