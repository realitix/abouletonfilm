This documentary provides further fascinating insight into the talent and the tantrums of the great man. Beset by hecklers, Kinski tries to deliver an epic monologue about the life of Christ (with whom he perhaps identifies a little too closely). The performance becomes a stand-off, as Kinski fights for control of the crowd and alters the words to bait his tormentors. Indispensable for Kinski fans, and a riveting introduction for newcomers, this is a unique document, which Variety called \u2018a time capsule of societal ideals and personal demons.\u2019", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zlb8EIPjO0dpYpjylfJgDwAqmeV.jpg", "actors": ["Klaus Kinski (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [204178, 260793, 113989, 110921], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
