{"tmdb_id": 380837, "title": "The Trojans", "original_title": "Les Troyens", "slug_title": "the-trojans", "date": "2012-06-25", "genre": ["Musique"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "After the destruction of Troy, the Trojan warrior \u00c9n\u00e9e sets out on a journey to found a new dynasty. He meets Didon, Queen of Carthage, and falls in love. But will \u00c9n\u00e9e's love for Didon prove stronger than his sense of duty? LES TROYENS ('The Trojans') is a tour de force of music that ranges from fiery military marches to intense choruses, passionate soliloquies \u2013 such as those of the prophetess Cassandre \u2013 and the lyrical love duets of Didon and \u00c9n\u00e9e. It is Hector Berlioz's largest work and he wrote the libretto himself, drawing upon his intimate knowledge of Virgil's Aeneid. To the composer's disappointment, LES TROYENS was only performed once in full during his lifetime and was often presented in shortened form during the 20th century. The Royal Opera's production provides a rare chance to see this epic work in its entirety. David McVicar's staging is on an enormous scale, assembling one of the largest casts ever seen at Covent Garden.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j7yZe6HrIoKFNqQTzo7tM2ToFtY.jpg", "actors": ["Bryan Hymel (Aeneas)", "Eva-Maria Westbroek (Dido)", "Anna Caterina Antonacci (Cassandra)", "Fabio Maria Capitanucci (Coroebus)", "Hanna Hipp (Anna)", "Ashley Holland (Panthus)", "Barbara Senator (Ascanius)", "Brindley Sherratt (Narbal)", "Ji-Min Park (Iopas)", "Ed Lyon (Hylas)", "Adrian Clarke (First Soldier)", "Jeremy White (Second Soldier)", "Robert Lloyd (Priam)", "Jihoon Kim (Ghost of Hector)", "Daniel Grice (Mercury)", "Kim Ji-hyun (Helenus)", "Pamela Helen Stephen (Hecuba)", "Lukas Jakobski (Greek Captain)", "Jenna Sloan (Polyxena)", "Sophia McGregor (Andromache)", "Sebastian Wright (Astyanax)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
