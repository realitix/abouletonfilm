As the title suggests that the movie is about a female (Rekha) who is a liar, and it is this female who shows how much lying can be a worthy quality. Nice movie with some good comedy. As in all Hrishikesh Mukherjee, the setting is a simple middle class family with ordinary existence. It is totally wonderful to see how Hrishikesh Mukherjee finds stories amongst all of us. Truly a mastermind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qSDFkTXa34GHdle8wX3u7zr0hQZ.jpg", "actors": ["Rekha (Kalpana Srivastav)", "Amol Palekar (Insp.
