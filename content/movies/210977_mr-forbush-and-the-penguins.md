But his decision to accept a six-month research post in the Antarctic, making the first detailed study of a penguin colony, changes all that...  Living in Shackleton\u2019s derelict hut, Forbush is alone at the frozen edge of the world, his only links to civilisation a two-way radio and letters to his elusive, would-be girlfriend, Tara, in London.
