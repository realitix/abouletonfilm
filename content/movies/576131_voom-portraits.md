The recent developments in HD technology have allowed Wilson to create something like a precise hybrid of still photography and motion pictures. Actors such as Brad Pitt (as a crazy person on the streets in the rain), Isabelle Huppert (as Greta Garbo), Steve Buscemi (as a mad butcher chewing gum on a variety show), Robert Downey Jr. (as a dreaming corpse in a Rembrandt painting), and Winona Ryder (as Winnie, the main female character in Samuel Beckett\u2019s Happy Days, buried up to her neck in sand) were asked to \u201cthink of nothing\" and move slowly and steadily to collaborate in Wilson's vision of who they might be.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jF5lnDKsidNau5fM0dCsybnvE8V.jpg", "actors": ["Willem Dafoe ()", "Steve Buscemi ()", "Johnny Depp ()", "Brad Pitt ()", "Robert Downey Jr. ()", "Isabelle Huppert ()", "Winona Ryder ()", "Isabella Rossellini ()", "Princess Caroline of Monaco ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
