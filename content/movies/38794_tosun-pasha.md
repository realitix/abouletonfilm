Two traditionally rival Turkish families, \"Seferoglu\"s and \"Tellioglu\"s are competing for the \"Green Valley\". The winner will be determined by Daver Bey, who has a beautiful young daughter, Leyla. Both families try to arrange a marriage between a man from their family and Leyla, so that Daver Bey will be inclined to give the green valley to his \"relatives\". Tellioglus, who are behind in the race, desperately find a final solution: They will fake their idiotic butler, Saban, as the highest ranked Ottoman soldier in Egypt: Tosun Pasha.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t4U4qK2Iqn2gJSP22HZVBkTQBT2.jpg", "actors": ["Kemal Sunal (\u015eaban / Fake Tosun Pa\u015fa)", "\u015eener \u015een (L\u00fctf\u00fc)", "M\u00fcjde Ar (Leyla)", "Adile Na\u015fit (Tellio\u011fullar\u0131'ndan Adile)", "Ay\u015fen Gruda (Tellio\u011fullar\u0131'ndan Zekiye)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [31405, 69610, 74302, 31547], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
