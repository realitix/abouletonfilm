The singers are all first-rate, and led by Lorin Maazel and the Orchestra of the Paris Opera.  But the direction by Losey and his team is unfocused, and seems to care more about making some confused socio-political commentary, and not so much about telling a clear story. (For just one example, what in the world has Losey done to the sextet in Act 2?  Does that scene make any sense?)  In short, here you will find magnificent Mozart, and lousy Losey."}], "recommandations_id": [76200, 79921, 35030]}
