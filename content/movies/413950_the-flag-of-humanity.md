Barton went through many trials and setbacks before she succeeded. This short, as was all Warners' shorts, was made for the express purpose of theatrical release and not as something made with the school market in mind. Many of their 'Historic America' shorts were later made available for school showings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oiC33zhOvIsxvlh3jOHlsExRrGX.jpg", "actors": ["Nana Bryant (Clara Barton)", "Fay Helm (Elsie Howard)", "John Hamilton (Gen.
