It took us a long time to find out what we were going to contribute to this project but about a week ago we both had a strange dream on the same night which referred to entering a dark abyss and a terrifying black void, each of our dreams seemed to refer to each others\u2019, echoing and in some ways answering the other\u2019s. We immediately began work on this 10 minute scene which we knew straight away would be created for The Last of Deductive Frames.\"", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
