Ahmed was planning to meet with her parents to ask for her hand, then suddenly went abroad to get his doctorate. Hoda's father [Ibrahim Saafan] got into a severe financial crisis and died, leaving Hoda in great pain. She felt better when she heard Ahmed was returning, but his plane crashed while Hoda was waiting to meet him at the airport. Her friend Dolat [Soheir El-Bably] tried to get her to accept treatment at a home for women, but she would not stay there; she went on a partying binge in Lebanon instead. Then Hoda heard Ahmed had not died, so she wrote him a letter about her situation. Ahmed came to see her, but she overdosed on sleeping pills and killed herself the following day.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cYPNPhHv6038Xh1mvafiUopcwZz.jpg", "actors": ["Naglaa Fathy (\u0647\u062f\u0649)", "Soheir El Bably (\u062f\u0648\u0644\u062a)", "Rushdy Abaza (\u0632\u0643\u064a)", "Omar Khorsheid (\u0645\u062f\u062d\u062a)", "Sayed Zayan ()", "Mahmoud Yassine ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
