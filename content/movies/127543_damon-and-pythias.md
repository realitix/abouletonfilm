It emphasizes different aspects of Greek philosophy and throws both of its main characters into moral dilemmas.  Damon has to overcome his fear of never trusting anyone... to the point of possibly sacrificing himself for a relative stranger.  Pythias has to decide whether his honor or his family come first.  The dialogue is pretty cheesy in parts and the acting fair, but the movie is enjoyable overall and should be more widely-viewed - especially for attempts that seem almost ahead of its time: making the audience do some thinking for itself!"}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
