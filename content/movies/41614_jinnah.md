The flashbacks start in 1947 as Jinnah pleads for a separate nation from the Muslim regime, infuriating Lord Mountbatten. Mountbatten then tries to enlist Gandhi & Nehru to persuade Jinnah to stop his efforts. Gandhi sides with Jinnah, which upsets Nehru. However, Jinnah turns down the offer to become prime minister and the film takes another slide back to 1916, which reveals all of the political implications that have occurred.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6gNDyfZhQEOkeVWbsfTMOuvXx8V.jpg", "actors": ["Christopher Lee (Mohammed Ali Jinnah)", "James Fox (Mountbatten)", "Maria Aitken (Edwina)", "Shashi Kapoor (Narrator)", "Richard Lintern (Jinnah (Younger))", "Indira Varma (Ruttie Jinnah)", "Sam Dastor (Gandhi)", "Robert Ashby (Nehru)", "Shireen Shah (Fatima Jinnah)", "Yousuf Kamal (Liaquat Ali Khan (as Shakeel))", "Ian Gelder (English police officer)", "Michael Elwyn (Sir Cyril Radcliffe)", "Ian Gelder (The English police officer)", "John Nettleton (General Gracie)", "David Sterne (Birwhistle)", "David Sterne (Birtwhistle)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "YoDjscRb5WM"}
