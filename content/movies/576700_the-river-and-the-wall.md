They set out to document the borderlands and explore the potential impacts of a border wall on the natural environment, but as the wilderness gives way to the more populated and heavily trafficked Lower Rio Grande Valley, they come face-to-face with the human side of the immigration debate and enter uncharted emotional waters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wiC2ukBxlUIJ3ed0matDJPlkpnx.jpg", "actors": ["Ben Masters (Himself)", "Beto O'Rourke (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "nOwFV4S1I-k"}
