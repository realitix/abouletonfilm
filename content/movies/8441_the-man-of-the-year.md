His new look supplying an unexpected jolt of confidence, M\u00e1iquel asks Cledir, the salon employee who died his hair, to join him at the bar in celebration. Taunted by local bully Suel upon arrival at the bar, M\u00e1iquel decides to settle the matter by purchasing a rifle and shooting down the loudmouthed Suel in the presence of Suel's young girlfriend. Unexpectedly hailed as a hero by his neighbors and the police, Suel's girlfriend subsequently approaches M\u00e1iquel and claims that since he killed Suel, it is now M\u00e1iquel's responsibility to care for her.
