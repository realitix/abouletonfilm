Admired by musicians and fans alike for their unique brand of rock and roll and blistering live performances, they appeared destined for stardom before tragedy struck and a brain aneurysm left guitarist Chick Graning fighting for his life. Fast forward 10 years and Scarce are back to prove their passion still resonates today. The biopic contains never seen before footage of Scarce including studio sessions, archive and early footage, interviews with Scarce friends such as Kristin Hersh (Throwing Muses), Joe Lally (Fugazi), fans new and old, and Industry cohorts that never stopped believing in Scarce.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
