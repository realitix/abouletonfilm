{"tmdb_id": 314406, "title": "Under Milk Wood", "original_title": "Dan y Wenallt", "slug_title": "under-milk-wood", "date": "2015-06-20", "genre": ["Drame"], "score": "5.3/10", "synopsis": "Two versions of Dylan Thomas' classic play \"Under Milk Wood\" were shot, with the same cast, one in Welsh,  \"Dan y Wenallt\", and one in English. Directed by Kevin Allen, narrated by and starring Rhys Ifans, the films were shot largely in the Pembrokeshire village of Solfa during the summer of 2014.  This surreal and erotic interpretation of Dylan Thomas' work is the first theatrical production of the brilliant, haunting radio play since Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton's 1972 film. Certain to astonish and excite in equal measures, this production reunites director Kevin Allen with actor Rhys Ifans over 15 years after the release of their cult classic \"Twin Town\". An ensemble Welsh speaking cast of familiar faces is led by Ifans as First Voice and Captain Cat, with Charlotte Church as Polly Garter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yK61UicWGyjLEzkfA9nT6B7YTJg.jpg", "actors": ["Rhys Ifans (Captain Cat)", "Charlotte Church (Polly Garter)", "Steffan Rhodri (Mog Edwards)", "Di Botcher (Mrs. Dai Bread 2)", "Sara Sugarman (1st Neighbour)", "Julian Lewis Jones (2nd Drowned)", "Lisa Palfrey (Mrs. Dai Bread 1)", "Rhodri Meilir (Mr. Ogmore)", "Ll\u0177r Ifans (Nogood Boyo)", "Nicholas McGaughey (Butcher Beynon)", "Helen Griffin (Mrs. Willy Nilly)", "Habib Nasib Nader (Black Colossus)", "Aneirin Hughes (Organ Morgan)", "Bradley Freegard (Sinbad Sailor)", "Sian Grace Phillips (Little Girl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "hqHAwLeJzhU"}
