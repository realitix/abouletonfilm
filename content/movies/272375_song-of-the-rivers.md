Dutch filmmaker Joris Ivens was the leading director. The sprawling film celebrates international workers movements along six major rivers: the Volga, Mississippi, Ganges, Nile, Amazon and the Yangtze. Shot in many countries by different film crews, and later edited by Ivens, Song of the Rivers begins with a lyrical montage of landscapes and laborers and proceeds to glorify labor and modern industrial machinery. The musical score is by Dmitri Shostakovich, with lyrics written by Berthold Brecht, and songs performed by German communism's star Ernst Busch and famous American actor, singer and activist Paul Robeson who also narrates. Song of the Rivers is an ode to international solidarity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6Fo4DhD3obYGjyBKSyURviuCcif.jpg", "actors": ["Alex McCrindle (Narrator)", "Paul Robeson (Voice of Singer)", "Sergio Vasconcelos (Brazilian Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
