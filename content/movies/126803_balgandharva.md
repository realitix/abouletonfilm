This film does well to document his life, the younger generation who is unaware of his charisma will get to know him.  The film chronicles his life , his acting career well. It gives a good overview of how the drama companies were run and how he influenced the running. His values and character stand out amidst all the tragedies in his life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hCEhJdX5qLdbzaSsVHwPZEulRpx.jpg", "actors": ["Subodh Bhave (Balgandharva)", "Nitin Chandrakant Desai (Lokmanya Tilak)", "Vibhawari Deshpande (Laxmi)", "Kishore Kadam (Ganapatrao Bodas)", "Abhijit Kelkar (Sadubhau Ranade)", "Prachiti Mhatre (Johar Begum)", "Avinash Narkar (Balasaheb Pandit)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "GRtw1VYUOmU"}
