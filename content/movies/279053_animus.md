It takes the viewer to the early Edison days when moving images of a man walking or sneezing were a novelty. Schwartz combines those historical sequences with contemporary animation to comment on the progress of movie-making in the twentieth century. This \"how-to animation\" with its \"tongue-in-cheek\" mix of live action, animation and xerography serves as an introduction to the concept of structuralism.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
