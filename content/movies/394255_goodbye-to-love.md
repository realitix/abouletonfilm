He longs for and mourns for, his increasingly disconnected and disparate love for a person. Goodbye to Love is an epilogue of a romance, contemplative of a protagonist who meditates on the forking ways his liaisons have left him. Suspended in that final, desperate monochrome moment, Goodbye to Love geometrically traces the evaporating points of a love triangle in three spare, melancholic acts. An elegy to the demise of a feeling, and the longing that permeates", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7fXb880qSCr127HhRbwbH8aLa73.jpg", "actors": ["Lee Swee Keong ()", "Pang Khee Teik ()", "Toh Mei Mei ()", "Lee Choy Wan ()", "Khang Tsung Hui ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "XWU8YMWgJXI"}
