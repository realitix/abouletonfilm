An enamored Ting Tien (Pai Piao) spends a cold winter's night waiting to spot the love of his life, Ling Shuang-hua (Szu Shih), when she makes her usual morning excursion onto her balcony. The theme of his love for her is treated with sensitivity, though his love does not affect the fate in store for both himself and the woman he worships. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, Rovi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mgahmNJISnSlGJZztRiKZil2q0u.jpg", "actors": ["Jason Pai Piao (Ting Dien)", "Elliot Ngok (Magistrate Ling Tui Si)", "Ng Yuen-Jun (Ti Yuen)", "Shih Szu (Ling Seung Wa)", "Kwan Fung (Mui Nian Sang)", "Dick Wei (Man Kwai)", "Walter Tso Tat-Wah (Man Chun Shan)", "Wai Wang (Yin Yuen Ping)", "Tong Kam-Tong (Qiu Cheung Fat)", "Liu Lai-Ling (Qiu Qi Fong)", "Benny Lai Keung-Kuen (Fat's student)", "Wong Ching-Ho (Martial Artist at Restaurant)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "KoIuzDcyBfQ"}
