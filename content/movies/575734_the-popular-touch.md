This is a home movie domestic comedy experimental film drama. Autobiography too. It\u2019s also part four of an ever-growing trilogy.  Starting in 2003 I decided to make a series of pieces alongside my regular films, a strand that would constitute an ongoing fictional autobiography. But as all creative work is, to some extent, autobiographical, and as I appear in most of my films, and all the people in these films are who they say they are, then what made this different from the rest \u2013 or from real life, really \u2013 became kind of blurred. Fuzzy even.  So this is fuzzy fiction \u2013 latest in the line.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ulUp7yz2uuOu7SywG04YDjfZJMj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
