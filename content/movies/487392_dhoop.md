In this era a honest man is defined as one who readily accepts a bribe and does the needful, while a dishonest man is one who accepts a bribe but refuses to do the needful. It is in this atmosphere that the Kapoor family live. Suresh, Peehu and a reluctant Sarita decide to call it \"Kargil Heights\" and go about obtaining the necessary documents to get it running, little knowing that the corrupt system will not permit them to take a step forward without bribing it's officers, of all ranks, who will refuse to issue any permit unless and until their palms are greased. Will Suresh, Sarita and Peehu ever be able to open \"Kargil Heights\", or will it just remain a dream?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Om Puri (Prof. Suresh Kumar Kapoor)", "Revathi (Mrs. Sarita Kapoor)", "Gul Panag (Peehu Verma)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
