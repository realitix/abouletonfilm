That continent is Africa -- or, more specifically, the coast of Ethiopia. Director Folco Quillici takes his cameras deep, deep into the waters near the coastal islands of Dalach, observing the passing parade of sea life on an up-close-and-personal basis. Particularly thrilling is a shark attack and its aftermath, with the cinematographers obviously in the thick of things. Gian Caspare Napolitano provides the narration, while the lush, evocative musical score is the handiwork of Roberto Nicolosi.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vmgXBgbdOdPwuCBZzNiKT3d4yMF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
