It is there that he meets and takes up with the oafish Renato, young mother Claudia and her young daughter Zoe. The rules to survive are simple. Leave no trace, make no sound and leave no odors behind. The undead, you see, hunt by sound and smell. And no matter how careful Marcos and his group are, the undead are ranging farther and farther afield looking for food as the population in the city dwindles. It is only a matter of time before they are found.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cO8OeDZR0zwlU0rb50DHDuVtKzD.jpg", "actors": ["Marcos Duarte (Marcos)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
