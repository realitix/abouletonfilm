In an effort to keep them occupied, they buy them a VCR, which only makes the boys lazier, moodier, more bloodthirsty and more perverted. They start drinking alcohol and visiting hookers, torture and kill a cat and peep in on the maid bathing before raping, murdering her and hiding the body. A new maid is hired, starts having sex with one of the boys and wonders what that foul smell is coming from the well. Will she face the same fate as the first maid?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vxe0snLqpTCEktS5wOYN3RBDJZ2.jpg", "actors": ["Mayurachath Muarnprasitivej ()", "Jintara Sookkapat ()", "Chosri Misommon ()", "Ron Rittichai ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
