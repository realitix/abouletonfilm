The referee is to the left; like the fans, he hardly moves as two fighters swing roundhouse blows at each other. Mike Leonard, in white trunks, is the aggressor; in black, Jack Cushing stands near the edge of the ring, warily pawing the air as Leonard comes at him. A couple of punches land, but the fighters maintain their upright postures.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9dEen9dLWqWD7CMDxwskCL2D5my.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Cushing (Himself)", "Mike Leonard (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [159904, 189055, 159910, 194091], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
