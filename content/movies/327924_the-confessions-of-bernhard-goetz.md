The incident immediately set off a national debate about crime, race relations, vigilantism and the right to self-defense. The inner mindset of Goetz himself, presented primarily through his unapologetic videotaped statement to police, is the main focal point of the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iUzAZZ2X67HtEiVxqIV2oRYtg0e.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
