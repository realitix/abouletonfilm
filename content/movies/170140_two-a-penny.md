Cliff has stated that Two A Penny, his most dramatically challenging movie role ever, is the film he is proudest of. He has stated, \"if I did want to send a fiolm as a CV, I would send that one\". It is certainly his most demanding and controversial role; cynical, self centered and highly manipulative, Jamie Hopkins lies, steals and double-crosses his mother (Dora Bryan), forces himself on his girlfriend (Ann Holloway) and gets involved in fist fights with criminals. Through the influence of his girlfriend, a born again Christian, is the possibility that he may reform, yet in the mystery of the film's by-line \"He promised to love her forever\u2026.today\" lies the possibility that he may well not.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v4NPt5T6R596XN3ev4y7Fe5sMkF.jpg", "actors": ["Cliff Richard (Jamie Hopkins)", "Dora Bryan (Ruby Hopkins)", "Avril Angers (Mrs Burry)", "Ann Holloway (Carol Turner)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
