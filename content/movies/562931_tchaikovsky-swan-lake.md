Rudolf Nureyev's interpretation of Tchaikovsky's lyrical ballet, far from being a clich\u00e9d stereotype of this celebrated masterpiece, is an expos\u00e9 of astonishingly powerful and recognisable human emotions. Under the inspired and clearcut musical direction of Vello P\u00e4hn, this production of one of the jewels of the Paris Opera Ballet's repertoire brilliantly displays the meticulous precision, technical prowess and pure, unmannered style of the company's unrivalled female corps de ballet, eliciting an ethereal, intense beauty captured for DVD in High Definition video and superb surround sound.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n8mJEIh6qL6dnt0TSnL15UGFvCg.jpg", "actors": ["Agn\u00e8s Letestu ()", "Jos\u00e9 Martinez ()", "Karl Paquette ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
