He meets Natalie, a beautiful club-hopping hipster, and quickly falls in love. Realizing he's just not cool enough to attract her on his own, he seeks the help of his friend Bobby, a free-spirited smooth talker who works in the mail room at Waymon's firm and utilizes the predicament as leverage to advance in the company.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gEjWuUwWQdfSDPCEvD42HWKsBuP.jpg", "actors": ["Samuel L.

But without the jokes. And the crime backdrop. So what we're left with without these elements is a rather empty shell of a film.\r\n\r\nUsually a big big fan of African American comedies of the 90's but yeah this was no winner.\r\n\r\nBitching soundtrack though."}], "recommandations_id": [39310, 29463, 28121, 22067], "youtube_key": "SRJ5_z6MpWo"}
