The run-off is in full spate and open water shows offshore. Ice cakes melt on the shingle. On the bay are ducks. It is time to build a kayak, a task shared by two men. They gather materials: valuable scraps of wood, bone, seal skins and sinews. Now there is much cutting, fitting, joining and binding. The woman helps by cutting additional thongs, scraping skins, providing food. She must also amuse the child who seems left out by the single-minded work of the men. Then the work breaks and a man harpoons a fish in a tide pool; all share the pleasure of fresh food.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lvUjCuNuTajXFahlUp9o2q4tnzY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
