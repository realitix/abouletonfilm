But for Max and his classmates Fabio, Joscha  and Lukas this song in particular has become a real hit at school as well as in the regional music scene: Their band called Systemfehler is on the verge of a breakthrough. But just before the important gig, which could get them a record deal, guitarist Josha is injured and can't play. Inge happens to be an excellent guitarist, and the only person who can fill in at such short notice. But when Max asks for her help, she imposes one non-negotiable condition: If she decides to play with the band, they will not perform the song \"Wenn Inge tanzt\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/626ASoEmfiuxMpOwCvh6ihJnttk.jpg", "actors": ["Tim Oliver Schultz (Max)", "Paula Kalenberg (Inge)", "Peter Kraus (Onkel Herb)", "Constantin von Jascheroff (Joscha)", "Tino Mewes (Fabio)", "Thando Walbaum (Lukas)", "J\u00fcrgen Tarrach (Hausmeister Lohmeier)", "Dagmar von Kurmin (Hildegard Tietz)", "Matthias Koeberlin (Dan Biermann)", "Anna Keul (Mala)", "B\u00e9atrice Jean-Philippe (Frau Stanger)", "Lilay Huser (Krankenschwester)", "Andreas Potulski (Bestatter)", "Roswitha Ehlen-Athuman (Frau Lohmeier)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [52830, 232083, 4339, 10418], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
