One day Minty's agent, BIG BOSS, an older and honorable gentlemen, is taken hostage by DOCTOR BRAIN BENDER, the evil neuro-scientist. Minty then fights her way up various perverse floors of Doctor Brain Bender's paranormal building to rescue Big Boss. Several unusual villains stand in her way: CAPTAIN CAPABILITY, a freak of nature; SENSATIONAL NINJA, an effeminate assassin; RAT MONSTER, a depressed mutant; BRUCE ZEE, a psycho martial artist; MOLLY LEVIATHAN, a sensual super vixen; ZEN COWBOY, a blindfolded gunslinger; and DOUBLE DELICIOUS, an intellectual lesbian vampire. Throughout this wild odyssey, Minty educates her adversaries on the fascinating world of natural science and then uses her beauty, her brains, and pure brutality to demonstrate the biological theory of the survival of the fittest", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4aAZSsxK669ldJ0cuXJ2yy4vPW1.jpg", "actors": ["Elina Madison (Minty)", "Anthony Ray Parker (Big Boss)", "Tabitha Taylor (Double Delicious)", "Chip Joslin (Dr. Brain Bender)", "Jacki R.
