Four factories in the metropolitan area of Mexico City are taken as spots for anthropological exploration. Documenting industrial landscapes, factories, bosses, workers, machines and commodities, the film shows a reflection on how these relationships have an imprint on society outside the factories. This is a testimony on the dignity of workers and their daily labor, with all the effort it entails and how it is rendered invisible by consumer society.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
