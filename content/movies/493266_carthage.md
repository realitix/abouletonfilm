Now, as never before, audiences are invited to witness the events of the days preceding the martyrdom. Based on documents handed down through the generations, Carthage offers a glimpse into the turmoil and testimony of the men whose place in history was forever defined by what was to come - a jailer seeking to protect his charges, a governor caught between the persecuted and their persecutors, and a group of Saints whose faith and brotherhood stands as the ultimate witness of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sQ5f9qAlnvczVcxvAdTNpwYKXCS.jpg", "actors": ["Darin Southam (Joseph Smith)", "Jasen Wade (Hyrum Smith)", "Lincoln Hoppe (John Taylor)", "Joshua Michael French (Willard Richards)", "Jake Stormoen (Dan Jones)", "Michael Buster (Governor Ford)", "Paul D.
