Einschlafgeschichten doesn't really speak of bridges or railroads but rather of two girls filling the space between daytime and dreamtime with a poetic game, an endless game, a game with no end. A game which can fade out without becoming fragmentary. \"Are you asleep?\", one of them asks at the end of a clip \u2013 and the final shot is of the two, asleep; the game is over. The girls are played by Lara and Anna, Farocki's daughters.\"", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
