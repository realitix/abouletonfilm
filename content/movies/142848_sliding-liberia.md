Risking everything to explore the West African country devastated by decades of war, they record the stories of people they meet - people like Alfred, who became Liberia's first surfer after finding a bodyboard while fleeing from rebels. Besides rediscovering a break that could be the best-kept secret in the surfing world, they find something more important - a way to travel responsibly in the 21st century.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b3cz4vz0oDtFPLg1aRSIeTzreQW.jpg", "actors": ["Britton Caillouette (Himself)", "Nicholai Lidow (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
