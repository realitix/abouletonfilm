By 1982, there were 13,000 dedicated arcade locations across North America. It was the Golden Age of Arcade Games, generating $3.2 billion dollars in 1983. By 1985, revenue had fallen 97%. Atari declared bankruptcy. Arcades closed. Most of the old games were converted or destroyed. A few were packed into warehouses where they remained, largely forgotten, for at least another decade. This is the story of arcade video games, and the generation who grew up in the arcades attempting to collect and preserve their fondest memories.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b3yg3KDAl1Zd1ec6MtyPiCoS1VY.jpg", "actors": ["Chris Alcott (Himself)", "Pete Ashdown (Himself)", "Jean Baudin (Himself)", "Deb Bazzano (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "327iCaaZd8Q"}
