Joe escapes through a window and hails a taxi, but when he gets nervous at the sound of sirens, he jumps out. Hardware salesman Peter Harris accidentally hits Joe with his car, and unharmed, Joe seizes this opportunity to hide in Peter's car. Peter is so drunk that Joe is able to con him into believing that he is Charles Edwards, a fellow hardware man who was with him at a convention, and in the guise of friendship, accompanies Peter to his suburban home. The next morning, Joe gets antsy and wants to leave, but Peter's family, his wife Mary, young son Robert and daughter Jane all entreat him to stay.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gW290O1oDN07xUB32qxP2t9FBIL.jpg", "actors": ["Lloyd Nolan (Joe Albany)", "Mary Carlisle (Jane Harris)", "Lynne Overman (Peter Harris)", "J.
