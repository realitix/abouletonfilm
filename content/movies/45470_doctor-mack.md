One night, he escorts an injured gun robber to the government hospital, where he unexpectedly meets his old friend from college time, Dr. Jaw, now a reputed surgeon with an aspiration for senior management. To Jaw's bitter surprise, he finds himself outshone by Lau's medical talent and kindness to patients. Jaw is however determined to speed up his career ascent at the expense of Lau. His plots work perfectly, until an accident delivers his life to the mercy of Lau.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ijVPPcRzSv4k4mDL6fspZqMHqXQ.jpg", "actors": ["Tony Leung Chiu-Wai (Dr. Lau Mack)", "Lau Ching Wan (Chiu)", "Jordan Chan (Tattoo Choir's conductor)", "Richard Ng (Professor Bao)", "Christy Chung (Jamie)", "Andy Hui (Dr. Sam So)", "Alex To Tak-Wai (Dr. Roger Jaw)", "Hilary Tsui (Zin)", "Eileen Tung (Lok Mei)", "Law Kar-Ying (Wong Jau)", "Gigi Leung (May)", "Law Kar (May's dad)", "Lawrence Ng (K.T.)", "Jessica Chow Jing (Fung)", "Wong Hei (Tiger)", "Farini Cheung (Nurse)", "Wyman Wong Wai-Man (Brother Fook)", "Jerry Lamb (Tong Ching)", "Wong Wa-Wo (Secretary Pak)", "Winston Yeh (Hospital chief)", "Jason Chu (Missionary)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [45442, 107972], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
