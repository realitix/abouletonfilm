Disbelieving at first, the all male, identically uniformed pupils are informed that what they had always been taught as fact is no longer true. When the incredulous students speak out, what initially seems laughably absurd becomes desperately real as they are forced to question how far they will go to stand up for their beliefs. Two &amp; Two is an allegory for the absurdness of dictatorship and tyranny - and the resilience of the human spirit.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cJvc40B6sUiP6Q7efLlTcC4XaDk.jpg", "actors": ["Bijan Daneshmand (Teacher)", "Ravi Karimi (Student 1)", "Pouyan Loti (Student 2)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [58937], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
