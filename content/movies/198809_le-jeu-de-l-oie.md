When his family leaves on vacation, the man has an affair with a pretty office worker. The relationship between the two develops slowly before they end up in bed together. Speeded up shots are used effectively to illustrate the thoughts of the characters. Technical aspects and performances are fine and overshadow some uneven editing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/19ryMdvhvwCW42IKB2LqLHut5Uo.jpg", "actors": ["Sonia Bruno ()", "Mar\u00eda Massip ()", "Jos\u00e9 Antonio Amor ()", "Julieta Serrano ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
