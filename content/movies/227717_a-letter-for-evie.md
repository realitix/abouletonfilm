It's received by \"Wolf\" Larson, who immediately throws it away, but his sensitive, dreaming--and short--buddy John McPherson snags it, and begins a correspondence with Evie, pretending to be Wolf. But things get complicated when Evie wants to meet her tall, handsome soldier. And even more complicated when Wolf sees Evie and likes what he sees.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/efQOYAh5a38XapSRiZzdm6t3ZSL.jpg", "actors": ["Marsha Hunt (Evie O'Connor)", "John Carroll (Edgar 'Wolf' Larson)", "Hume Cronyn (John Phineas McPherson)", "Spring Byington (Mrs. McPherson)", "Pamela Britton (Barney Lee)", "Norman Lloyd (DeWitt Pynchon)", "Percival Vivian (Mr. McPherson)", "Donald Curtis (Capt.
