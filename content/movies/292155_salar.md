The first is Carlos, a poor salt miner. Unlike his colleagues, he is unwilling to take the one time compensation package from an American conglomerate who wants to purchase the mining rights. Carlos would rather get paid for doing actual work than risk living off a one time payment without a guarantee of any other work in the area. Carlos being the one holdout irks his fellow miners, who cannot get their compensation until Carlos also agrees to the terms. Carlos views all gringos in a bad light because of this situation. The second is Marc, an American doctor who has worked in various third world countries providing aide where needed. Marc is completing his term here. Carlos and Marc have a turbulent few meetings based on Carlos' feelings toward gringos and his want for a simple stable life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/95UCJycVznEqOo5qziiQOp40OnZ.jpg", "actors": ["Juan Carlos Aduviri (Carlos)", "Soledad Ardaya (Marisol)", "Maya Cahua (Mar\u00eda)", "Oona Chaplin (Sandra)", "Peter Killy (Marc)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
