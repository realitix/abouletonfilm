Wintour's insider account of this epic tale of faith, fanaticism, persecution and betrayal is told in detail, from his recruitment of both Fawkes and his own brother to his capture in a dramatic siege and bloody shoot-out on 8 November.  The hopes, fears and plans for a Midlands rebellion, royal kidnap, the plotters' penetration of the king's bodyguard and Fawkes' attendance, sword in hand, at a wedding attended by the king in December 1604 are shown, as well as a dramatisation of the thrilling, forgotten story of the final days after 5/11 as the conspirators are hunted down and then face the terrible punishments reserved for traitors.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pErpZDHpHTDuMrwB71zjyAIyqxN.jpg", "actors": ["Jamie Thomas King (Thomas Wintour)", "Jamie Maclachlan (Guy Fawkes)", "Joseph Kennedy (Robert Catesby)", "Charles Aitken (Robert Winter)", "Ken Drury (Re Giacomo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
