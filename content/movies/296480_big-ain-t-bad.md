Luckily, or so it would seem, she finds a wealthy suitor perfectly willing to include her among his accolades. Ric, now thoroughly lovelorn, sets off in hopes of proving that status and expensive gifts aren't valuable if there's no love involved.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
