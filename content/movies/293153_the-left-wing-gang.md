The gang were radical left-wing activists. In 1989, seven of them were charged with being behind a series of the most professional robberies in the history of Denmark. The many millions stolen in the gang's activities were transferred to the terror organization PFLP with the aim of supporting anti-Israeli Palestinians. The assumed leader of the gang, Jan Weimann, never revealed his double life to his wife or friends, and police superintendent J\u00f8rn Moos, who was in charge of the investigation, staked his career to catch the gang members.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gA430Bob0GN6POvB8JOkJ4GGTEP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
