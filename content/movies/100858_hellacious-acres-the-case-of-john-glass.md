He also learns that in order to reestablish a livable atmosphere for what's left of humanity, he'll have to go on a solitary mission to retrieve important codes dispersed in remote locations. Soon enough, he'll encounter more than he bargained for: aliens, crazy survivors, inadequate equipment, LOTS of walking and a pretty unhealthy dose of bad luck.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uBFkQrcMSIetCEJNOLrq8h7sTAo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [143569, 195796, 64622, 52044], "youtube_key": "UgE-Cl2Es7I"}
