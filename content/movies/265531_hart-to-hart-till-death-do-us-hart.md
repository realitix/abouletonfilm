Following the operation, she plans to spend a romantic anniversary in Munich with her husband Jonathan. The bone marrow clinic's director, Peter Donner, is surprised by Jennifer's uncanny resemblance to his French fianc\u00e9e, Simone Grohe. When she goes missing, Jennifer steps in to play the role of Simone to save Peter the embarrassment of an explanation to his cousin and benefactor Karl von Ostenberg at the lavish engagement party. But, of course, it is Karl who kidnapped Simone - in order to control the fate of Peter's inheritance - and now Jennifer is in as much danger as Simone! Once again the Harts tackle danger and mystery with their usual devil-may-care charm and romance", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/auUjknycL5i0py89ZL20djsymka.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Wagner (Jonathan Hart)", "Stefanie Powers (Jennifer Hart)", "George Hamilton (Karl Von Ostenberg)", "Katja Riemann (Elsa Hellerstadt)", "Dwight Schultz (Peter Donner)", "G\u00f6tz Otto (Heinrich)", "Nellis Du Biel (Friedrich)", "Angela Roy (Dr. Detmeier)", "Lukas Langer (Maximilian)", "Dirty Harry (Freeway)", "Ursula Ludwig (Aunt Edna)", "Andreas Wimberger (Erwin)", "Andreas Wimberger (Mrs. Straus)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [253914, 269699, 293636, 258867], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
