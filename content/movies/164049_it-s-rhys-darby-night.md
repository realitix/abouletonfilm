I developed this show on the road and received big LOL\u2019s in LA, London, Edinburgh, and parts of Australia. Finally I toured my home country, New Zealand. It was absolutely choisome! (choice + awesome).\r Loads of you turned up, so thanks for jumping on board. Here\u2019s the final stop on the Darby train \u2013 The mighty Civic Theatre, Auckland. In the extra\u2019s section I have put together behind the scenes footage from the NZ tour, and my favourite characters, Bill Napier and Ron Taylor make an appearance.\r It\u2019s Rhys Darby night!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yLWr6ogCxKL5dFFiwbkGJ7pm1tA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
