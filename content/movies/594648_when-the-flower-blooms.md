This piece is triggered by the shocking news of his death.

The repeated typing of words that seem to be squeezed out of the unconscious shows a strange unity with Akemi Edo's live concerts \u2013 conveying funky loneliness \u2013 and intrigues the souls of the viewers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hahKHaaIRKQnJySS00w4jt6NkUv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
