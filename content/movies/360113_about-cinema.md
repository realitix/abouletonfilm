They all respond to two basic questions: why do they make movies and why do they serve the seventh art. The filmmakers share their thoughts about time, narrative, rhythm, light, movement, the meaning of tragedy, the audience\u2018s desires and the boundaries with other forms of art.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eIDwcA0x1i9j2mYv8Aftx0b3BBe.jpg", "actors": ["Ariano Suassuna ()", "Ruy Guerra ()", "B\u00e9la Tarr ()", "J\u00falio Bressane ()", "Andrzej Wajda ()", "Karim A\u00efnouz ()", "Hector Babenco ()", "Ken Loach ()", "Gus Van Sant ()", "Vilmos Zsigmond ()", "Jia Zhangke ()", "Asghar Farhadi ()", "Salvatore Cascio ()", "Jos\u00e9 Padilha ()", "Benedek Fliegauf ()", "Lucrecia Martel ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
