Unfortunately Chain Reaction just comes off as being a very plain mediocre film. When I originally first saw this film I had no clue what it was about but now since seeing it with a better perspective I now know what it's about, I suppose the story in this does work well but this film does have it's problems, I'm not saying this film is bad as it's watchable but it's very plain.\r\n\r\nThe first problem in this film that comes to my mind is the music soundtrack, oh my gosh, talk about the wrong type of music for your film. Having the right music for your film is extremely important and the people that were behind the films musical design got it all completely wrong. In hindsight this is a chase film where the hero is wrongly accused of something he didn't do and is being chased by the police, but the scenes themselves are just \"plain\" and could have been better. I know I keep using the word plain but when I say this I don't mean it in a bad way, like I said the story does work well.\r\n\r\nOverall conclusion, it's a mediocre action film that's not bad but it's it's just...well...plain."}], "recommandations_id": [9208, 9886, 11258, 9882], "youtube_key": "XmqvTVuOzgA"}
