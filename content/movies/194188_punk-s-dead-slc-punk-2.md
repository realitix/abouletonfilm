Ross, Penny and Crash, young outsiders from different tribes, embark on a road trip to a huge punk show. Ross, 19, is the love child of Trish and Heroin Bob, who died before Ross was born. During their odyssey, and with the help of a healthy dose of drugs, alcohol and punk music, Ross shreds his darkly Gothic outlook and embraces life. His mother Trish, who raised Ross alone in her steam punk shop, discovers that he is in a crisis. She recruits his 'uncles,' Bob's old SLC gang, to help find him. When all collide at the concert, they are forced to deal with their unresolved relationships with Bob.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1IzcjXhZHewvmLfKd8eGucDutyQ.jpg", "actors": ["Ben Schnetzer (Ross)", "Devon Sawa (Sean)", "James Duval (John The Mod)", "Sarah Clarke (Trish)", "Hannah Marks (Penny)", "Machine Gun Kelly (Crash)", "Adam Pascal (Eddie)", "Jenny Jaffe (Shelly)", "Michael A.
