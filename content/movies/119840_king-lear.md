When Cordelia, youngest and most honest, refuses to idly flatter the old man in return for favor, he banishes her and turns for support to his remaining daughters. But Goneril and Regan have no love for him and instead plot to take all his power from him. In a parallel, Lear's loyal courtier Gloucester favors his illegitimate son Edmund after being told lies about his faithful son Edgar. Madness and tragedy befall both ill-starred fathers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8VLEWRPhr382BeAmWgM3kmif0Ia.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Hordern (King Lear)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
