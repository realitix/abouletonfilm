However, nearly everyone in the town is something other than what they seem. Lu has a shameful secret in his past, which motivates Miss Li to ask Pai to kill him. The town boss is minting counterfeit coins, and someone is trying to gather the evidence of this. Events bring Lu and Pai onto the same side, which is fortunate, because the town boss brings in Mr Lung, a fearsome martial arts genius, to kill off all his enemies.
