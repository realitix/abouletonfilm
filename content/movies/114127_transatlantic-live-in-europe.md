The show was part of the tour to support the band's second studio album, Bridge Across Forever.  In keeping with the tradition of covering a classic progressive rock epic on each release, Live In Europe features the band running through The Beatles' Abbey Road medley as part of the intentionally Beatle-esque \"Suite Charlotte Pike.\" Rather than being a straight cover version, each section of \"Suite Charlotte Pike\" is juxtaposed with a section of the Abbey Road medley.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1Kf5CpQWCtQJSHAnvfOgzdsQsKU.jpg", "actors": ["Neal Morse (Lead Vocals, Keyboards, Guitar)", "Mike Portnoy (Drums, Backing Vocals)", "Pete Trewavas (Bass Guitar, Backing Vocals)", "Roine Stolt (Guitar, Backing Vocals)", "Daniel Gildenl\u00f6w (Additional Keyboards, Additional Guitar, Additional Percussion, Backup Vocals)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
