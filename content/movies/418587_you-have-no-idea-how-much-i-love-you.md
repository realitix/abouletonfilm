This is the problem Hania and her mother Ewa face during their sessions with a psychotherapist, filmed intimately and with the utmost respect by director Pawe\u0142 \u0141ozi\u0144ski. The camera always focuses on one person at a time, revealing every emotion hidden behind the words and silences. The empathetic therapist carefully but purposefully peels away the hard layers under which mother and daughter shield themselves. Little by little, the personal tragedies that hamper their communication rise to the surface, as well as the source of the longing for love and acknowledgement that they find so hard to fulfill.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t1srJjVSszb4pUhVlJGCbRVodZ0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
