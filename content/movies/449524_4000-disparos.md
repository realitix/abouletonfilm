A history full of the most traumatic episodes which I access more through readings and less through my own body, through an instinctive reaction which is sensitive to me. The way I react to what touches me, to what disgusts me, or to what I profoundly desire defines how I move. It defines the political use of my existence. Art helps me to approach and respond to what provokes me. It also helps me to experience more wholeness along the way. To make this work, I used a roll of Super 8 film to shoot, frame by frame, faces of random men in the streets of Buenos Aires. The urgency, the obsession, the randomness, and the aesthetics of the video bring up an ambiguous atmosphere of this past\u2014the very amnesia in which this memory is embedded.\" -  Jonathas de Andrade", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
