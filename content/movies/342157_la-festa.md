The boys were in the family home of one of them, Fabio, for a party. But the next morning, none of them was still there. Gone, vanished into thin air. A few months later their parents receive an anonymous DVD, which contains the shooting of what happened the night of the party. They are not just shootings, but something similar to a real movie about that night. Edited, set to music, post-produced. But who shot that video? And why? The truth seems not to be hidden in the content of that video only.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kLOqAJKWg15LSBmeVDFTMfI13MG.jpg", "actors": ["Andrea Consonni (Fabio)", "Micol Donghi (Giulia)", "Niccol\u00f2 Gentili (Matteo)", "Roisin Grieco (Claudia)", "Romolo Guerreri (Raniero)", "Matilde Maggio (Elena)", "Marco Nugnes (Giacomo)", "Simone Riccioni (Francesco)", "Thomas Cibelli (Alessio)", "Cinzia Monreale (Fabio's Mother)", "Karl Zinny (Fabio's Father)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "9qPVX_FPWQw"}
