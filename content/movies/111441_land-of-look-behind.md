Relatively unknown due to poor distribution and New York Film Festival skullduggery, this breathtaking film presents a unique epic vision with quasi-dramatic elements and cinematographic wizardry. The non-reggae original soundtrack is outstanding, as is the reggae music of Bob Marley and Gregory Isaacs. The great documentary filmmaker Werner Herzog has called \"Look Behind\" the non-fiction film that has influenced him most over the last fifteen years. Indeed, this film's peers are the best of Herzog, Bunuel's \"Land Without Bread\", Flaherty's \"Nanook\" and Leacock-Pennebaker's \"Louisiana Story\". With thoughtful viewing, one will see this moving documentary actually end with a lovely little dream sequence. No American has come close to making a film this ingenious in the last thirty years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1hMb84W8mlX8pgxZZSGQ2Lv1Zkp.jpg", "actors": ["Gregory Isaacs (Gregory Isaacs)", "Louis Lepke (Louis Lepke)", "Mutabaruka (Mutabaruka)", "Bob Marley (Bob Marley)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
