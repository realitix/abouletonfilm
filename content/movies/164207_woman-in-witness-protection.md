The cops persuade Biwako to play the bait to catch the killers. Two veteran detectives are assigned to protect her at all times, and as the film progresses the guardians have no choice but to deal with the overly dramatic, hilarious, and sometimes harrowing ups-and-downs of Biwako's life. Beautifully shot and dynamically structured in a way that only the Japanese are capable of, Marutai reminds us that sometimes the most loyal friendships are formed under the darkest circumstances.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wsFX4FzydbY1R3wYiGt1PgpeMi4.jpg", "actors": ["Nobuko Miyamoto (Isono Biwako)", "Masahiko Nishimura ()", "Kazuya Takahashi ()", "Masahiko Tsugawa ()", "Toru Emori ()", "Akira Nagoya ()", "Taro Yamamoto ()", "Houka Kinoshita ()", "Daisuke Ry\u00fb ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
