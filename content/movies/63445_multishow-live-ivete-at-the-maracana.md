Sangalo rose to fame with the ax\u00e9 band Banda Eva, and since 1999 has embarked on an unstoppable solo career, making her the undisputed queen of pop in Brazil in terms of sales and popularity, as well as gathering countless industry and society awards. Accordingly, Sangalo put on a show at the Maracan\u00e3 that should leave no one envious of the megaconcerts offered in Rio by Madonna, Michael Jackson, and the Rolling Stones. Alternating some of her many hits with new songs or new versions of old material, Sangalo burns through the set with her characteristic enthusiasm and infectious star magnetism, incessantly cheered on by an adoring audience of 55,000. The album has sold over 800,000 copies in Brazil (being certified Diamond), and features the single \"Deixo\". Recorded on December 16, 2006.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sB6V7tuRWFzo0vk3bBgB1Pv4vYr.jpg", "actors": ["Ivete Sangalo (Herself)", "Alejandro Sanz (Himself)", "Saulo Fernandes (Himself)", "Durval L\u00e9lys ()", "Samuel Rosa ()", "Buchecha ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
