Over the decades, TWRF has organized several psychotherapy workshops for the survivors of Japan\u2019s military sexual slavery during WWII. Supported by a community of others with the same experiences and embraced by social workers and counselors, these survivors rebuilt their identities and self-esteem. Ultimately, the documentary honors the women as survivors, not victims, and thus, inspiration of human dignity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mUBbyFYxODWeYsIOkNlhumnyI2G.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
