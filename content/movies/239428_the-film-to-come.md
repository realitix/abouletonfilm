The titular film is a holy fragment of celluloid that can only be seen by a secret society known as the Philokinetes. They watch it on a loop, somnambulating through a life that is unreal by comparison. It is the belief of the Philokinetes that film has an existence \u201cindependent from humans. Cinema, they said, is the primeval soup of a new life form. There from were to emerge pure screening creatures. Which is to say, non-topical beings.\u201d - n+1", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tkHtzgbKsCMCKfvJsJYLKDaXnZV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [139772, 148118, 148050, 148068], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
