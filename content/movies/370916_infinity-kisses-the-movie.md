It incorporates extracts of the original 124 self-shot 35mm color slide photo sequence, Infinity Kisses, in which the expressive self-determination of the ardent cat was recorded over an eight-year period. Infinity Kisses - The Movie recomposes these images into a video, in which each dissolving frame is split between its full image and a hugely enlarged detail.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4jxaqgBwV9UeDbbLZLzXZBCgkeQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "_m4wuJH4M8I"}
