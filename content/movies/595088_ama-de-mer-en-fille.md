The weather is ideal for shell fishing in the shark-infested waters of the Japanese Sea of Hegura Island. Yet Aoi, 21, still a novice, is nervous to dive in front of her more experienced grandmother. Machiko, 82, is a traditional Ama free diver, meaning \"woman of the sea.\" She is one of the last custodians of a 2 000 years old expertise, one of harvesting abalone and the other precious shells that once had a place of honour at the emperors' table.The Ama tradition is passed down from mother to daughter but for several generations now the ice-cold waters, the scarcity of seashells and the mortal danger that represent both sharks and other fishing boats have discouraged the younger generation who is migrating to Japan's large cities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1WirRm0Z3UqyLQqDlfTVvd044A7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
