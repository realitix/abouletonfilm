A young local wants to encourage tourism, so he commissions a sculpture of the Unknown Tourist for the town square; the sculptor he brings to Rhodes is Kate's ex-husband. Also there to see Kate is Sharp, an aging antiquarian and her dear friend. He has something important to tell her. As Kate, her ex, and Sharp sort out things that go back years, two English tourists bumble about, one thinking he's fallen in love with Kate, his wife thinking she's found her own lover. A rare vase, a spy, old friendships, the statue's unveiling, and off-hand English sorting-out play into the resolution.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tpprl91nZ3yppnskd79OhfcXUUP.jpg", "actors": ["Jacqueline Bisset (Katherine Shaw)", "James Fox (Patrick)", "Irene Papas (Penelope)", "Sebastian Shaw (Sharp)", "Kenneth Branagh (Rick)", "Lesley Manville (Carol)", "Robert Stephens (Konstantinis)", "Geoffrey Rose (Thompson)", "Paris Tselios (Yanni)", "Ruby Baker (Chloe)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "c7SMYgJfo7Y"}
