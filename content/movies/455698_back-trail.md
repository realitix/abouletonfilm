Brown rides into a small town where he becomes embroiled in a blackmail scheme. The town's banker (Ted Adams), a pillar of respectability, once served a jail term. Outlaw leader Pierce Lyden threatens to reveal Adams' secret if the banker doesn't let him know in advance when the gold shipments are going through. Adams tearfully tells Brown the whole story, whereupon Johnny rides shotgun on the next shipment himself. Back Trail was one of the last films directed by workhorse Christy Cabanne, whose career stretched all the way back to the D.W. Griffith days.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ANW57hALLt3PWKg4e9usFQVvF.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Mack Brown (Johnny Mack)", "Raymond Hatton (Cahoose)", "Mildred Coles (Helen Frazer)", "Marshall Reed (Henchman Lacey)", "James Horne Jr. (Terry Dugan (as James Horne))", "'Snub' Pollard (Goofy (as Snub Pollard))", "Ted Adams (Bob Frazer)", "Pierce Lyden (Frank Gilmore)", "George Holmes (Henchman Rocky)", "Bob Woodward (Henchman Turk)", "Carol Henry (Henchman Peco)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
