Then tensions and tail fins flare in \"Bubble Buddy,\" as SpongeBob irks everyone with his provocative new best friend: a silent--yet rather demanding--bubble. Surprisingly witty, fast-paced humor and fresh, detailed animation make watching each quirky show a visual and auditory treat. But the great lure of SpongeBob is that his dilemmas relate equally well to young and old.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g4ivB0bjWICCdzGffzjXFliTsmK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
