Toni dreams big and enters a local television talent show. About that time, a local Mob boss decides Toni is great entertainment and invites him to be his guest at a casino. Toni chats up Irene, a cigarette girl, he gets an odd job or two from Chisolm, the mobster's number two, the audition goes bust, and Toni's future is uncertain. One thing leads to another with the Mob. Is Toni at a crossroads, or is there in reality no turning or going back?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2QU4OSjF7evAG6e6TVO0Jd50Jlj.jpg", "actors": ["Ian Hart (Toni Cocozza)", "Kelly Macdonald (Irene)", "Brian Cox (Chisolm)", "Alun Armstrong (Bill)", "Tommy Flanagan (Michaelangelo)", "Iain Cuthbertson (Connolly)", "Una McLean (Dainty)", "Jimmy Chisholm (Kenny)", "Jimmy Yuill (Rod Edmunds)", "Richard E.
