Young activist Eik Skal\u00f8e has his entire life turned upside down when he falls head over heels in love with the beautiful peace activist Iben Nagel Rasmussen, and she falls in love with him. But Iben is a child of the times, and freely accepts the order of the day: free love and sex. She renounces personal right of ownership and will not settle for one man when she can have several. In typically romantic fashion, he begins a struggle to win all of her love. As a poet, writer and singer he constantly confesses his love to her. But Eik must accept defeat, and in 1968 he travels without his beloved Itsi Bitsi to Nepal, the Land of Dreams in the East. A journey from which he will never return.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wLFwYTQPUDABZlXNFU06ideSBx8.jpg", "actors": ["Ola Rapace ()", "Thure Lindhardt ()", "Julia Ragnarsson ()", "Anette St\u00f8velb\u00e6k ()", "Marie Tourell S\u00f8derberg ()", "Christian Gade Bjerrum ()", "Joachim Fjelstrup ()", "Caspar Phillipson ()", "Max Hansen ()", "Johannes Nymark ()", "Petar Cvirn ()", "Luka Pero\u0161 ()", "Ivan Glowatzky ()", "Zlatko O\u017ebolt ()", "Ana Marija Percaic ()", "Jakob Randrup ()", "Morten Hembo ()", "Nicholas Aagaard Knudsen ()", "Jakob Bj\u00f8rn Hansen ()", "Nikolaj H\u00fcbbe ()", "Sara Viktoria Bjerregaard Christensen ()", "Sidsel Siem Koch ()", "Louise Herbert ()", "Martin Greis-Roshental ()", "Paw Henriksen ()", "Toni Bobeta ()", "Ivo Popovic ()", "Peter Hald ()", "Jan Overgaard Mogensen ()", "Sofia Saaby Mehlum ()", "Natalie Madue\u00f1o ()", "Pelle Nordh\u00f8j Kann ()", "Kasper Leisner ()", "Mario Petrekovic ()", "Ida Uhrenfeldt ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
