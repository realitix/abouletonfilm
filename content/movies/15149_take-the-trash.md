Being number one in the company and having a beautiful wife and a lovely home, Jesper seems to lead a perfect life, but one day his arrogance and self confidence hits him in the face like a boomerang and he loses everything overnight. Jesper is sentenced to do community service at a recycling center with the odd and funny characters Dion, Theodor, and Lotte. At first he looks down on these people and doesn't want to be associated with them. When he begins to loosen up, however, he discovers that he can learn a lot from their straight forward and honest approach to life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cKMMOblR44pc8oJlYEx238WsKDH.jpg", "actors": ["Thure Lindhardt (Jesper Jensen)", "Sidse Babett Knudsen (Lotte)", "Mick \u00d8gendahl (Dion)", "Troels Lyby (Theodor)", "Beate Bille (Dorte)", "Helle Fagralid (Sofie)", "Per Rosenberg (Karsten)", "Maibritt Saerens (Kasandra)", "Claes Bang (Lars)", "S\u00f8ren Malling (Varberg)", "Jens J\u00f8rn Spottag (Steiner)", "Anne-Grethe Bjarup Riis (Elin)", "Martin Brygmann (K\u00f8rerl\u00e6re)", "Dick Kays\u00f8 (Dions far)", "Mira Wanting (Dions kone)", "Mia Lyhne (Karen - AF dame)", "Ditte Hansen (Hanne)", "Claire Ross-Brown (Tine)", "Thomas Voss (Jespers kollega #1)", "Mads Wille (Jespers kollega #2)", "Marie Caroline Schjeldal (Fiona)", "Troels Malling Thaarup (Sofies Ven)", "Kristian Ibler (Smart fyr i jakkes\u00e6t)", "Bo Thomas (Tysker #1)", "Adam Brix (Tysker #2)", "Hussam Al-Mashadani (Indvandrer #1)", "B\u00fclent Uzun (Indvandrer #2)", "Eva Kaas (Gammel Dame)", "Benjamin Lorentzen (Tjener)", "Kim Kold (Rocker)", "Betina Daugaard Petersen (Fitness-Pige #1)", "Louise Gry Boldreel (Fitness-Pige #2)", "Noah Lazarus (Soldat)", "Allan Gr\u00f8ndahl (Ambulanceredder)", "Per Scheel Kr\u00fcger (Chef)", "Simon Sigurd (Mand i Fitness-Center)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [48746, 17959, 72054, 15537], "youtube_key": "dI-WXTLdyxw"}
