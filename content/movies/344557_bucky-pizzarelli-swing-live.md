The seven-string guitarist is always game for anything, and with a superb group -- including nearly everyone's first-call bassist, Michael Moore, clarinetist Allan Vach\u00e9, vibraphonist Peter Appleyard (who previously worked with Benny Goodman, as did Michael Moore and the leader), and drummer Bernard \"Pretty\" Purdie -- the veteran leads his group through seven favorites from the swing era. The set sounds very relaxed and informal, as if the musicians were playing for their own fun and had no idea tapes were rolling. A snappy take of \"Perdido\" and an extended workout of \"Limehouse Blues\" are but two of the memorable tracks recorded that evening.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7Jc5CMsjUoOb1GkOFRTDRqJaWZT.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Appleyard (vibraphonist)", "Allan Vach\u00e9 (clarinetist)", "Michael Moore (bassist)", "Bernard \"Pretty\" Purdie (drummer)", "Bucky Pizzarelli (guitar)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
