The robbers are willing to kill their own team, to get away. As Jack Regan himself puts it after the first raid in the film: \"I've never seen so many dead people\". Armed with gold-plated Purdey shotguns, they evaded Regan and the Flying Squad for quite some time, before Regan finds encouragement from his Detective Chief Superintendent who was sent down for corruption because Jack wouldn't testify in court for him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cOR98L8qK87rBSFhwcV7tFclJnv.jpg", "actors": ["John Thaw (Detective Inspector Jack Regan)", "Dennis Waterman (Detective Sergeant George Carter)", "Denholm Elliott (ex-Detective Chief Superintendent Jupp)", "Nigel Hawthorne (Detective Chief Inspector Dilke)", "Ken Hutchison (Hill)", "Anna Ga\u00ebl (Mrs Hill)", "Derrick O'Connor (Llewellyn)", "Georgina Hale (Switchboard Girl)", "Brian Hall (Haughton)", "James Warrior (Jellyneck)", "Barry Stanton (Big John)", "John Alkin (Tom Daniels)", "Frederick Treves (McKyle)", "Guy Standeven (Logan)", "Johnny Shannon (Harry)", "Clifford Kershaw (Gloria's Father)", "Brian Gwaspari (White)", "Toby Salaman (Doctor)", "Fiona Mollison (Mrs Haughton)", "Patrick Malahide (Major Conway)", "Lewis Fiander (Goran)", "Anna Nygh (Shirley Hicks)", "Michael J.
