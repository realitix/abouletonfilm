These sessions took place at the Complex Recording Studios in Los Angeles on October 3, 1994, just one day after Young's critically-lauded Bridge School Benefit concert. Earlier that year, Young and his band had recorded the studio album \"Sleeps with Angels\" at the Complex studios and came back to film a series of music videos. Jonathan Demme was there to document the recording session, which began at 6:30 pm on a Monday evening and concluded at 4:30 am the next day. \"The Complex Sessions\" is the result of these sessions.  Set List: 1. My Heart (3:08), 2. Prime of Life (4:44), 3. Change Your Mind (14:56), 4. Piece of Crap (3:08).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v8iIeXmV3IMycpftA6HRJcpokjh.jpg", "actors": ["Neil Young (Himself)", "Ralph Molina (Himself)", "Billy Talbot (Himself)", "Frank Sampedro (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "QHFyksF05Iw"}
