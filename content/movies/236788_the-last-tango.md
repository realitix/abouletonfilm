He managed to capture the killer, but his emotions get the better of him, possibly jeopardising the trial. His boss sends him away to cool down, and he ends up in a small town in the middle of the Karoo. Here, he meets a passionate and beautiful woman who is dying of cancer. His only goal is to fight boredom until he is allowed to resume his detective duties, while her dying wish is to dance one last tango before her life is over. He reluctantly agrees. Meanwhile the murderer wakes from his sedation and puts his plan for revenge into motion", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qz1NOQIitA40cP9i91mhSk0724V.jpg", "actors": ["Louw Venter (Hercules de Wet)", "Antoinette Louw (Ella Winter)", "Stian Bam (Basson)", "Marius Weyers (Capt Mauritz Duvenhage)", "Rob van Vuuren (Kevin King)", "Heino Schmitt (Sgt Dave Malan)", "Loukmaan Adams (Sgt Basie Beyers)", "Ilse Oppelt (Col Magda Hoffman)", "Stephanie Badenhorst (Dr Brink)", "Gerhard Odendaal (Klein Willem Post)", "Wessel Pretorius (Const.
