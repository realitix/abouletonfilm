He chomps popcorn and continually ribs the magician about his \"easy\" tricks, finally driving most of the audience away. Then the magician calls Woody on stage to \"assist\" him in a few \"tricks,\" which enables him to get back at Woody for some of his taunts. Then Woody turns the tables, putting the magician under a magic spell. As the magician comes out of the spell, he tries to get rid of Woody by shooting him out of a cannon. But after the shot is fired, Woody's still there. In desperation, the magician climbs into the cannon and fires himself off the stage!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9MohR0WZEyoFV5UmxaigOG2Uwfm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
