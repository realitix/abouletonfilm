In this short documentary we meet a group of trans activists who have taken matters into their own hands and set up a safe space swimming club. It is a film about the healing effects of community and the relief that comes after taking the bravest plunge of all - to just be yourself. It is also an ode to universal joys of swimming.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d7YM4hLmeacfnPwwGKA1GDlbeO0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
