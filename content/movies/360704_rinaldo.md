It is the first Italian language opera written specifically for the London stage. The libretto was prepared by Giacomo Rossi from a scenario provided by Aaron Hill. The work was first performed at the Queen's Theatre in London's Haymarket on 24 February 1711. The story of love, battle and redemption set at the time of the First Crusade is loosely based on Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata (Jerusalem Delivered), and its staging involved many original and vivid effects. It was a great success with the public, despite negative reactions from literary critics hostile to the trend towards Italian entertainment in English theatres.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t8obcIh4Nlg5DMlUpv5c3rC3kbS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
