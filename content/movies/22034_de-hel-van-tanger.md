Inside their bus, hidden behind a false compartment, they have discovered 700 pounds of hashish. Although the owner of the bus company is arrested as well and makes a full confession clearly indicating that both drivers were unaware of the hidden drugs, the Moroccan judge sentences both men to 5 years in the Moroccan prison of Tangiers. Nothing could have prepared the two men for life inside a Moroccan prison. Without food, clothes or medical care, they must learn how to take care of themselves to survive their stay in prison. Corrupt guards, corrupt lawyers and judges, a consul who doesn't care and frequent beatings are only part of the terrible prison. Meanwhile their families at home are left without any information, any help or any hope - finding out that their own government doesn't care for Belgian people in prisons abroad.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wg2FGA8jOqubGa5asM9lE3eQ4MQ.jpg", "actors": ["Filip Peeters (Marcel Van Loock)", "Peter Gorissen (Rudy Vermeersch)", "Veerle de Jonghe (Veronique)", "Warre Borgmans (Jozef Van Zuylen)", "Els Olaerts (Agnes Van Loock)", "Peter Bolhuis (Jack Scholten)", "Axel Daeseleire (Wim Moreels)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [44103, 13646], "youtube_key": "Bd_f81FqOCg"}
