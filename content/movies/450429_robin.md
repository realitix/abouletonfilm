The problem is that the police doesn\u2019t find any trace to prove what happened to her. It remains a complete mystery. Robin feels abandoned by the police, who clearly think she\u2019s the victim of an overactive imagination. Ever her husband and her sister have all the trouble in the world to believe her.
