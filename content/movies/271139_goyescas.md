The original theatrical version, in turn, was inspired by the paintings of 19th century Spanish artist Goya. The story concerns two woman, one a fiery singer of peasant stock, the other an amorous noblewoman. Much is made of the fact that the women closely resemble one another-and small wonder, since both are portrayed by opera diva Imperio Argentina. Things get really dicey when both women fall in love with the same man (Rafael Rivelles).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/52WswbrO38sMUXQc54s7P3YLeXi.jpg", "actors": ["Imperio Argentina ()", "Rafael Rivelles ()", "Armando Calvo ()", "Manolo Mor\u00e1n ()", "Marta Flores ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
