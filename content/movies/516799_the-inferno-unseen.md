The Inferno Unseen is a newly edited assemblage of rushes filmed in 1964. With his cinematographers Andr\u00e9as Winding, Armand Thirard, and Claude Renior, Clouzot staged seemingly endless kinetic and optical experiments focusing primarily on Schneider performing simple, seductive actions in carefully composed mises-en-sc\u00e8ne. Departing from Serge Bromberg\u2019s critically acclaimed documentary about the making of Clouzot\u2019s film (2009), The Inferno Unseen focuses solely on Clouzot\u2019s intoxicating visions, allowing them to build their own momentum as they unfurl in all their glory. Rollo Smallcombe is a London-based music producer, composer and filmmaker. His sonic inspirations range from the early experiments of Musique Concrete through to modern video-game, film, and horror scores.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bgkfhYebrIwLBalsLcfGH6bCVgh.jpg", "actors": ["Romy Schneider (Romy Schneider)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
