It's a story (in a form of a mosaic of short episodes and pictures) about the sadness and happiness of inhabitants of Kersko (Kersko is a small woody area full of cottages and roods). These people are both simple and sensitive, they have their own pleasures (e.g. Leli is a collector of cheap, but inutile things) and the greatest delight of all of them is a hunting. Crude poetics of amateur hunting is screened by dreamy pictures of this area. Menzel mixes sentimental lyricism and rough (but not vulgar!) humor and the outcome is the never-ending landscape of continuous life in the proximate nearness of nature. The performances of actors are brilliant. Both Rudolf Hrusinsky as a Franz and Jarom\u00edr Hanzlik as a Leli have nonrecurring charm bottomed on a pain and inebriation. Only the music is not perfect: Jiri Sust usually assembled his film music from his older works and in this movie there is many quotations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jqrfqw8w18ck9NoRoDtfBxt5DMc.jpg", "actors": ["Rudolf Hru\u0161\u00ednsk\u00fd (Jarin Franc)", "Jarom\u00edr Hanzl\u00edk (Leli)", "Josef Somr (kapit\u00e1n VB Vyhn\u00e1lek)", "Petr \u010cepek (\u0159ezn\u00edk)", "Miloslav \u0160tibich (Jel\u00ednek)", "Petr Brukner (traktorista Jane\u010dek)", "Rudolf Hru\u0161\u00ednsk\u00fd ml.
