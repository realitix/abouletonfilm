The fox and the raccoon fight viciously all night because only one of them can return to heaven alive. But the raccoon is outwitted by the fox and is injured severely. The raccoon, now transformed into a pretty young woman, is found unconscious in front of Young-gu's house. Young-gu's parents take her in as Young-gu's bride. But the fox has turned into a Hong Kong Granny Ghost and is killing children to drink their blood and eating their livers. Young-gu and the raccoon team up to fight the fox and the fox finally is killed when a lightening strikes its tail s only weak point. The raccoon bids farewell to Young-gu and ascends to heaven on a rope.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lpq7FTsySk9SXj0xz4vNo2RoU38.jpg", "actors": ["Kim Ji-seon ()", "Eom Yong-soo ()", "Park Jong-sel ()", "Shim Hyung-rae ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
