The documentary addresses this need for change through five individual yet interrelated structures society has come to rely upon -finance, education, religion, entertainment/ media, and health/ food. Each of these structures is fully broken down to show viewers how they have come into place, and why their continued existence can no longer be supported. The documentary concludes by drawing attention to consciousness. Addressing who we truly are, what we have come on this planet to do, and most importantly how we can go about doing it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e6w2IjxgK2ArUJi4FCfgSqqMI1C.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
