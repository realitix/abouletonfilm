You can expect the same with \u201cDog Eat Dog\u201d except that it mixes black amusement with its urban drama, sleaze and crime thrills. \r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s brutal, funny, ugly and quirky, but with a spiritual thread underneath it all. Think 90\u2019s crime drama/thrillers like \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d (1994), \u201cMojave Moon\u201d (1996) and \u201cThe Way of the Gun\u201d (2000). It\u2019s not on the level of \u201cPulp,\u201d but it\u2019s more entertaining than the other two. Knowing Schrader, I suspect there\u2019s more in the movie than meets the eye and I may up my rating with repeat viewings. Then again, it may be wannabe hip/edgy tripe. You make the call.             \r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 33 minutes and was shot in Northeast Ohio (Cleveland & Sheffield Lake) and Tampa, Florida (Restaurant & street scenes and night skyline). WRITERS: Edward Bunker wrote the script based on the novel by Matthew Wilder.            \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"}], "recommandations_id": [388202, 190967, 301608, 397003], "youtube_key": "Bj5E4P2hDao"}
