And Katya knows the right place: an old country house on the coast, the owner of which left for a long time. The secluded house, in which the spiritualist salon was at the beginning of the last century, seems to everyone an excellent option. Alarming, even the terrible abandonment of this place does not frighten anyone ... In the midst of the party, someone whom Katya never expected to see appears: the mysterious master of the house ... The man she loved. A man in the grip of otherworldly forces.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zaW2pIRgWOVmNVwYr3vXyTcmupo.jpg", "actors": ["Yuri Chursin ()", "Angelina Strechina ()", "Mikhail Meshcheryakov ()", "Anastasiya Ukolova ()", "Anar Khalilov ()", "Evgeny Egorov ()", "Marina Panferova ()", "Ivan Verkhovykh ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
