The Scarecrow, anxious to have the yo-yo just so Jasper will no longer have the yo-yo, tries a new approach, and tells Jasper the sad story of his poverty-ridden childhood, and he never owned a yo-yo. The more he talks about it, the angrier the Scarecrow becomes, so Jasper runs away, and takes his yo-yo with him.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
