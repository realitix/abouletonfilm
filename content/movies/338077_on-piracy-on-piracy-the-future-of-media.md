It pivots mainly around music, leaving software and movies completely in the dark. Main themes evolve around the judicial debate, but why not tackle this from a more philosophical (moral for instance) or cultural point of view ? Also from a technological point of view it declines to bring any interesting revelations. And what up with the disgusting musac layered all the time into the interviews ? It completely turns your attention away from the subject and gives you the impression of watching some cheap promotional video you might encounter on a late night tell-sell channel.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mL19G2acFdh9kL1o6V5JjylzG2K.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
