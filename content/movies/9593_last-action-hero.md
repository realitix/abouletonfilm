It very much has that vibe, and would have worked spectacularly to that end in a fun, meta, kind of way. But for better (_Maggie_) or worse (_Terminator 3_) Arnie just keeps on sluggin' and that's the world we live in.\r\n\r\nSo instead of that, I guess _Last Action Hero_ is really just a deconstruction of the over the top action movies the 80s and early 90s did with such aplomb. Is it a scathing criticism of them, or a love letter to them? I don't know, but _Last Action Hero_ works for me, and that's all I'm taking away from it.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"}], "recommandations_id": [9268, 9493, 9946, 9739], "youtube_key": "OJw8o49CNZI"}
