The funny rivalry between two parts of family, a foolish jealousy to the near living peasants' family, which had always non-selfishly been there for auntie, is a caricature of greasy human nature. This is a slight humor of the Soviet life details as well. But aunt Mirta isn't fool, and is still young in her heart until her last minute, that appears in her last will - to whom the car, the limousine in the color of St. John's night goes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nHQhJePRBxbsKNDtfOwIXeM1QS8.jpg", "actors": ["Lilita B\u0113rzi\u0146a (Mirtas tante)", "Olga Dre\u0123e (Dagnija)", "Uldis Dumpis (\u0112riks)", "Gundars \u0100boli\u0146\u0161 (U\u0123is)", "Baiba Indriksone (Olita)", "Bo\u013ceslavs Ru\u017es (Viktors)", "Di\u0101na Zande (L\u0101sma)", "L\u012bga Liepi\u0146a (Veronika)", "Romualds Anc\u0101ns (J\u0101zeps)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [126402, 114413], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
