In 'Extreme Machines' he travels faster, higher and harder than he's ever been before as he investigates the Apache gunship, drives jet boats, looks at a Swedish Stealth Battleship, rides snowmobiles, goes P-51 Mustang racing and gets to fly in an F-16. The series of 'Motorworld' looks at what makes a country tick. It studies why Italians are passionate, Indians crash so often, how the Cubans make brake fluid and much more. In 'Speed' Jeremy is rocketed into the adrenaline-pumping world of fast machines in the most exciting highlights from his TV series in which he sets out to explore both what compels us to pursue these limits - often at considerable risk to our own safety - and what effect the quest has on us.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2vvta38aigQmGnKHyqBdNdqfz9k.jpg", "actors": ["Jeremy Clarkson ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
