They are given the plans for a battleship; whichever finishes first gets the contract for the fleet. Bluto does his patriotic duty by refraining from his usual sabotage; his own incompetence provides much of the entertainment, until the end, when Popeye finishes first. Bluto, invited to help launch the ship, provides a bottle of champagne filled with nitroglycerine. Popeye's ship is destroyed, but after his spinach, he manages to turn out a ship every 5 seconds or so, launching an entire fleet for the war effort.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6gTQUwL7XZr7LzhzxecSwiG43MH.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Mercer (Popeye)", "William Pennell (Pluto)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
