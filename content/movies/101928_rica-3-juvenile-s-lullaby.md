But who's protecting the juvenile delinquents from corrupt reform schools? Rica (Rika Aoki) could be considered a bit of an expert on reform schools, having spent most of her early life in and out of them. When Rica is dragged back once again, she gets a severe beating and is finally sent off to a mental hospital with the intention of selling her and her pals into a slave trade. A trader takes Rica's friend Jun to a mountain cottage where she's pegged for the lead in his clandestine porno film operation. Once again, it's up to tough-as-nails Rica to bust up this corrupt racket once and for all!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v619IGOqU3b6hM51NGknHR0YGtL.jpg", "actors": ["Rika Aoki (Rica)", "Jiro Kawarazaki ()", "Taiji Tonoyama (Shimamura)", "Kotoe Hatsui ()", "Reiko Kasahara ()", "Masami Souda (Hanako)", "Yoshie Ichige ()", "Eiko Fukazawa ()", "Sh\u00f4ji \u00d4ki ()", "Tamotsu Tamura ()", "Mikio Shimizu ()", "Yasuo Arakawa ()", "Kayo Hirai ()", "Junko Tazawa ()", "Taeko Kurihara ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
