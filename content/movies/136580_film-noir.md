The images are beautiful, and the people are as cold as the snow that surrounds them. The take on Melville's \"Samora\u00ef\" from -67 is obvious, but Kobayashi turns the image around and portrays the killer as the weakest person in the movie - haunted by his demanding wife and the moaning contractor, who is one of the most mysterious characters ever portrayed in a movie.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ojYkrd3KKIG02GrLtJ0DIm2kJCk.jpg", "actors": ["Ryo Ishibashi (Yuji Hamazaki)", "Nene Otsuka (Kazuko - Yuji's wife)", "Ken Ogata (Client)", "Ken Mitsuishi (Kimio Komatsu)", "Sansh\u00f4 Shinsui (Taxi Driver)", "Takashi Yamamoto (Yasushi Hasegawa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
