(television). Consists in a collage of shots in super 8 of images of the TV. The collage is extremely quick, mixing average people with famous paintings, landscapes and churches, etc. The images become more and more abstracts, the referential pre-existing images are transformed by means of extreme close-ups of the screen, which ultimately becomes completely abstracts with texture of the TV like a television pointillism", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
