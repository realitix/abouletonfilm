They stumble upon the culprit, a mysterious and ghoulish man who is carrying a coffin through a secret door in a cemetery. They sneak in after him and watch him command the mummy to life; it is a beautiful woman, who he then commands to sing for his audience of skeletal theatre-goers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5SdVwLVL5p9y76x6DeVAIxog0uu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
