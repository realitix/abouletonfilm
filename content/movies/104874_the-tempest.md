He's in exile, banished from his duchy by his usurping brother and the King of Naples. Providence brings these enemies near; aided by his vassal the spirit Ariel, Prospero conjures a tempest to wreck the Italian ship. The king's son, thinking all others lost, becomes Prospero's prisoner, falling in love with Miranda and she with him. Prospero's brother and the king wander the island, as do a drunken cook and sailor, who conspire with Caliban, Prospero's beastly slave, to murder Prospero. Prospero wants reason to triumph, Ariel wants his freedom, Miranda a husband; the sailors want to dance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8DMGa0ChOx6SbinDkfPHA4G1uHk.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Bull (Alonso, the King of Naples)", "David Meyer (Ferdinand, his son)", "Neil Cunningham (Sebastian, his brother)", "Heathcote Williams (Prospero, the Right Duke of Milan)", "Toyah Willcox (Miranda, his daughter)", "Richard Warwick (Antonio, his brother)", "Karl Johnson (Ariel, an airy spirit)", "Jack Birkett (Caliban, a savage and deformed slave)", "Christopher Biggins (Stephano, a drunken mariner)", "Peter Turner (Trinculo, his friend)", "Ken Campbell (Gonzalo, an honest councillor)", "Elisabeth Welch (A Goddess)", "Claire Davenport (Sycorax)", "Kate Temple (Young Miranda)", "Helen Wellington-Lloyd (A Spirit)", "Angela Whittingham (A Spirit)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [172513, 246013, 51470, 51354], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
