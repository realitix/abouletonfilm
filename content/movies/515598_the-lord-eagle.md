Old Mikipper and his wife Oppuos live their days in thick taiga. Cows, hunting, fishing make up the simple everyday life of the old people. Once early in the winter an eagle flies into their garden. The old people dare no drive it away because eagles are sacred. All through the winter they feed the bird so that it does no attack their cattle. Gradually they grow accustomed to each other. On a cold Christmas day the eagle makes its way into the house and occupies the honorary place in the corner on the shelf next to the icons. From then on the people and the bird start their life together in one house.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sgSjOx04tMycPKJpzCe1U8oJsxq.jpg", "actors": ["Stepan Petrov (Mikipler)", "Zoya Popova (Oppuos)", "Afanasy Fedorov (Shaman)", "Prokopiy Danilov (Komsomol Member)", "Prokopiy Ivanov (Komsomol Member)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
