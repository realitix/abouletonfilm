The more I was shocked about how the disabled were depicted in this film the more I started to realize that in every non-disabled TV counterpart of this show (German TV shows like \"Popstars\" or \"Friedmann\" or the home shopping channels) its mentally \"non-handicapped\" participants are treated in a completely identical way: The total prostitution of the mind in front a huge TV audience at the expense of one's most important gifts one should hang on to: dignity. On the other hand one could completely understand people who are furious about \"exploiting\" these handicapped persons. But that's what Schlingensief's works are all about: shock people and don't care about those who cannot or will not try to get the message (if there is one).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/licHhYFWmKzATehPikCK5jpVbZI.jpg", "actors": ["Werner Brecht ()", "Susanne Bredeh\u00f6ft ()", "Ilse Garzaner ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
