Diksha, still just a girl, is caught unguarded on camera, besmirching the \"honor\" of her parents. Kiran, in love with the wrong boy, becomes the target of another man's lustful vengeance, \"dishonoring\" her family. And Virender, a young man cruising the streets at will, enjoys all the acts society forbids women, protecting or destroying their \"honor\" as he wills.
