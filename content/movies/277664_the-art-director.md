This short film walks the viewer through art directors' responsibilities and the demands on their talents. They read a script carefully and design a set to capture the time and place, the social strata, and the mood. They must be scholars of the history of architecture, furnishings, and fashion. They choose the colors on a set in anticipation of the lighting and the mood. Their work also sets styles, from Art Deco in the 20's to 30s modernism. Then it's on to the next project.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/96sby704x2sBUZnGaTUlbX52FV1.jpg", "actors": ["Dana Andrews ()", "Ronald Colman ()", "Joan Fontaine ()", "Ann Harding ()", "Rita Johnson ()", "Charles Laughton ()", "George Macready ()", "Dorothy McGuire ()", "Ray Milland ()", "Gregory Peck ()", "Jack Stoney ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
