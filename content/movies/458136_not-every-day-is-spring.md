His success abroad would eventually land him on an Istanbul Radio segment dedicated to Turkish Art Music \u2013 a salon style music derived from Ottoman classics, but standardized to modern republican values.  As part of the state run Turkish Radio and Television Corporation, Istanbul Radio was established in 1927. In the process of building the radio station, the vast Pangalt\u0131 Armenian cemetery was destroyed, its marble tombstones dispersed and integrated into the city\u2019s architecture. The destruction also made room for the Hilton Hotel, Taksim Square and Gezi Park, turning the area into the iconic centre of the new metropolis. In 2013, when bulldozers began to demolish Gezi Park to build a shopping complex in its place, they exposed remnants of the Pangalt\u0131 tombstones, before being blocked by mass protests.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
