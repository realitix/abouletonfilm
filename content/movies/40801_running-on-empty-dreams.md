Sounds simple enough; get the money, save her life. But her underpaid, working class husband can't afford the treatment. And time is ticking away. As Sydney begins to seek out a means to save her life, she begins to question her existence and does some soul searching, only to find herself falling in love with a single mom in the neighborhood that Sydney and her family have just moved into. Sydney is then forced to choose between her religious upbringing, her husband and son, and a love that she hides, all while fighting a losing battle to save her own life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1MUkyMjnXg0yLlgeuKKMj9DRd15.jpg", "actors": ["Kathleen Benner (Sydney Harris)", "Rachel Owens (Jane Smith)", "Jose Rosete (Corey Harris)", "Wil Rillero (Matt Harris)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
