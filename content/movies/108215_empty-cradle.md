When she wakes up the next morning, the hospital tells her, that her son died at birth. However from ultrasound reading she had before, she knew she was having a girl. Now the hospital is stone-walling her, saying she is just in denial, due to her loss. Now she is trying to fight the system, to find evidence of the apparent mistake by the hospital. Only it wasn't the hospital's mistake. Nurse Rita Donohue is the one who made the switch. She faked a pregnancy to hang on to her roving boyfriend. But she grabbed the wrong baby, her boyfriend wants a son, so now she's faking a second pregnancy, and making plans to get another baby.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gY6F1vPv479iiAvApD3mmQCp1Br.jpg", "actors": ["Kate Jackson (Rita Donohue)", "Lori Loughlin (Jane Morgan)", "Eriq La Salle (Detective Knoll)", "David Lansbury (Bob Morgan)", "Jonah Blechman (Patrick)", "Karmin Murcelo (Nurse Ramsey)", "Peter Crook ()", "Penny Johnson (Gail Huddle)", "Michelle Joyner (Sharon)", "Camilla Belle (Sally)", "Wendy Bowers (Donna)", "Zachary Browne (Sam)", "Skye Bassett (Nancy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
