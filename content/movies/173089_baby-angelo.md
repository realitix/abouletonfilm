Those with athletic inclinations will certainly enjoy a one-on-one game of basketball in Genevieve\u2019s outdoor unisport complex; or they can take a stroll in its very precise, ten-plant garden.  More than its old-world appeal, Genevieve\u2019s real treasures are its tenants, some of whom have lived in the complex for what seems like forever. A peculiar mix of old and young, families and young single professionals, you\u2019ll certainly be charmed by their ability to be ensconced in the daily, numbing repetition of their everyday lives.  You may have heard of the disturbing news involving the discovery of a dead fetus inside the dumpster beside Genevieve Homes, but don\u2019t let that feral murder discourage you from visiting us.
