Why do some gay men prefer to watch sex between two heterosexual men? Where does this desire come from? Is it innate or is it learned? And why would men who identify as straight choose to perform in gay porn? Straight Guys follows filmmaker Daniel Laurin on his journey to answer these questions and reconcile his own relationship to this type of pornography. Daniel speaks to porn historians, porn theorists, porn producers and the performers themselves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kKNzi2ksMc6ATz9qftIEWSBVPfl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
