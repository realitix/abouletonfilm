They were Jews, Fascists, anti-Communists, and others dispossessed. In a large hostel, where even married men and women were housed in separate barracks, the adults lived for two years while they worked off the government's payment of their passage. Even though he is married to Anna and has a son, Julian falls in love with Nina and she with him. As they and others face the new situations and prejudices that await immigrants and as they take on aspects of Australian culture, old-country values reassert themselves. Julian decides what to do about love and family, and Nina must find a way to move on.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aglyMAdQnDvp5jGHLIPmGwjHNGh.jpg", "actors": ["Gosia Dobrowolska ()", "Ivar Kants ()", "Anna Maria Monticelli ()", "Steve Bisley ()", "Debra Lawrence ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
