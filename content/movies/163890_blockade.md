By providing the originally silent images with a meticulously reconstructed soundtrack, the scenes from everyday life under siege seem to be set in the present. By not intervening in the montage but giving the scenes room to tell a story, the scenes transcend the specific historic events and lead a new life. They do not evoke memories of the past, but become a breathtaking reanimation of reality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hqJ4PC1wrRTU2m2GcM8XwdxIVHj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [190309, 46749, 189943, 193919], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
