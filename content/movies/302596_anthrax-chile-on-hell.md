The band performed an extended set that featured songs from Anthrax's entire catalogue - all the fan-favorites including \"I Am The Law,\" \"Indians,\" \"Madhouse,\" \"Caught In A Mosh,\" \"The Devil You Know,\" and \"I'm Alive.\" \"Santiago was the perfect place to film the show for this,\" said Anthrax's Charlie Benante. \"When we'd played there in the past, we'd finish our set, play our encore and go back to the dressing room. But every time, the fans would continue to scream and cheer and clap. I mean, they went on and on, they wouldn't stop. One time Scott and I walked out to the side of the stage just to watch what was going on in the audience, it was intense. Why wouldn't we want to film a DVD in front of an audience like that?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/imHWt8eOFLxWZWKyZv3AJ6J4bmh.jpg", "actors": ["Joey Belladonna (Vocals)", "Frank Bello (Bass)", "Scott Ian (Guitars)", "Charlie Benante (Drums)", "Jonathan Donais (Guitars)", "Anthrax ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "utFoyZLPHvQ"}
