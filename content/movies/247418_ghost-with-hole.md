She rises from the crypt as a Sundel Bolong (a mythological Indonesian revenge ghost) to exact vengeance in very gruesome and interesting ways. Can anyone stop her? \u2026or at least give this poor soul some peace? Starring film icon, Suzzanna, this pic explodes off the screen like a rocket-powered comic book. It\u2019s got it all, dark and moody atmosphere, a haunting score (infused with some synthpop disco numbers), gory ghostly killings, and some truly inventive cinematography.
