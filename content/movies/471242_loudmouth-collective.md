These poet-provocateurs are the creators of the infamous \"Anti-Reading\" series, a carnival-like alternative to the traditional poetry reading. On the film's soundtrack we hear how the Anti-Readings were started, descriptions of various Anti-Reading activities including the Poetry smokable poems known as \"Poetry Cigarettes\", the memory tester called \"I Forgot,\" and the \"Diary in the Shape of a Bunny\". The film includes footage shot at Anti-Readings, with time-lapse, double exposures, distorting lenses, and frenetic non-traditional camerawork evocative of the playfully chaotic spirit of the events.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bS9XrcZ5kjNyL3Y5a8G7p4eWP6I.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
