Isabelle wraps a picture, flies to her childhood home to pick up Emily, and plans to leave for her place in France. Old wounds between Isabelle and her parents open around Isabelle's life style. It's also apparent that Isabelle's mother, Paula, is unhappy - with her husband and with her youthful hopes dashed when she became pregnant with Isabelle. Unbeknownst to Isabelle, the co-star of the film she's just made has followed her, checked into a nearby hotel, and wants to begin an affair, even though he's married. Can Isabelle sort it out? What's best for Emily?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uuVlrwanXaU38EDeYJRfxPDC5UE.jpg", "actors": ["Brigitte Fossey (Isabelle)", "Hildegard Knef (mother Paula)", "Ivan Desny (father Charles)", "Ivan Desny (Charles, the father)", "Hildegard Knef (Paula, the mother)", "Hermann Treusch (Friedrich)", "Camille Raymond (Emily)", "Mathieu Carri\u00e8re ()", "Caroline Ruprecht ()", "Helma Sanders-Brahms ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
