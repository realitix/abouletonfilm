Even Sir John Falstaff is forced out of the taverns to raise a militia, but will his attachment to Hal be rewarded with promotion and the life of ease he feels sure he deserves? Henry IV Part 2 includes some of the greatest moments in Shakespeare: the deathbed scene of the old King, when Hal contemplates the crown; and Hal's devastating rejection of Falstaff himself. Roger Allam ('a Falstaff to treasure' - The Times) won the 2011 Best Actor Olivier Award for his performance in Henry IV Parts 1 and 2. 'Jamie Parker (Prince Hal) is 'terrific to watch' (London Evening Standard); he appeared in As You Like It at the Globe in 2009, and was also in The History Boys at the National Theatre, on Broadway and on film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1BFGtk4kPCsAEi5iLLU5Fp7oa6R.jpg", "actors": ["Roger Allam (Sir John Falstaff)", "Patrick Brennan (Sir Walter Blunt / Sheriff / Lord Chief Justice)", "Jason Baughan (Westmoreland / Peto / Fang / Wart)", "Daon Broni (Hastings / Travers / Drawer / Gloucester)", "Phil Cheadle (Lord Bardolph / Davy)", "Oliver Coopersmith (Falstaff's Page / Clarence)", "Oliver Cotton (King Henry IV)", "Sam Crane (Pistol)", "William Gaunt (Shallow)", "Sean Kearns (Warwick / Bullcalf)", "James Lailey (Mowbray / Gower / Will)", "Danny Lee Wynter (Poins / Porter / Feeble)", "Kevork Malikyan (Morton / Snare / Sir John Coleville)", "Jamie Parker (Prince Hal)", "Paul Rider (Bardolph / Archbishop of York)", "Lorna Stuart (Lady Percy)", "Joseph Timms (John of Lancaster / Francis / Shadow)", "Jade Williams (Doll Tearsheet)", "Christopher Godwin (Northumberland/Silence)", "Barbara Marten (Mistress Quickly / Lady Northumberland)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
