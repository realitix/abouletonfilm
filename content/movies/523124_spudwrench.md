As a defender of his people's culture and traditions, he was known as \"Spudwrench\" during the 1990 Oka crisis. Offering a unique look behind the barricades at one man's impassioned defence of sacred territory, the film is both a portrait of Horne and the generations of daring Mohawk construction workers that have preceded him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u3QhO6dB1ixOmOsaX0chG8kuJHH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
