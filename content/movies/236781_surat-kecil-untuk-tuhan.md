She is diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma (a cancer of connective tissues), which is unusual at her age. After undergoing twenty-five sessions of chemotherapy, the once healthy and beautiful Keke finds herself sickly and bald, with a disfigured face. Although the treatment initially works, the cancer returns a year later. Doctors estimate that Keke has three months to live. To help her deal with her pain, she begins keeping a diary; through her writing she finds the strength to hold on for a year. As she begins to accept her fate, she writes a letter to God in her diary, asking that her family be kept safe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s2lPM7DTVuEfRA3vWiYwSam5mnQ.jpg", "actors": ["Dinda Hauw (Keke)", "Alex Komang (Keke's Father)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
