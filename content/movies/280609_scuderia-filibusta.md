The story of his childhood, when he gets in touch with bikes and starts to work as a mechanic, is the previous part of a story that involves other riders and motorcycle lovers from the late 50s, like his brother Italo, Glauco Sansovini, Piergiovanni Volpinari, Glulio Manzaroli and Alfio Beccari. Through interviews, vintage photos and old videos, a lot of crazy anecdotes describe the spirit and the passion of the racing team. The protagonists explain how the first motorcycles were built (using old scrap parts), how they organized the first road races, how they built the first motocross track in San Marino, how they fought against rivals all around Italy, supported by their love for this sport but with no money at all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/WmtuIHO6WS90RzrYq3BruIOery.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
