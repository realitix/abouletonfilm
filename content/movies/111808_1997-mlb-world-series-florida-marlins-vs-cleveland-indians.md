They won the National League wild card--then became the first wild card team to reach the World Series by sweeping the Giants and shocking the Braves.  The Cleveland Indians were a far different team than the one that battled in the 1995 World Series. This year, nobody expected them to beat the Yankees or the Orioles--but somehow they did.  And so, these two underdog warriors slugged it out in the heat and snow of the World Series until they reached that quintessential moment--Game Seven. Even then, it went on--into the 11th inning--the second longest Game Seven in history--before Edgar Renteria sent all of Florida into a state of delirious celebration.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/txQkdZEWvggc3HashyjHSIae3ib.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
