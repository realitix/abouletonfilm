Fortified with only a gallon of gin and a salami, Smurch bests even Lindberg with the first non-stop, around the world flight. During the four days he's airborne, this unknown kid becomes a world hero. But, on the ground, a young reporter, anxious to tell the world about their new idol, learns Smurch is bad news. An arrogant, illiterate lout with a police record, Smurch's only interests are \"parties, broads and dough.\" But, the reporter is silenced and Smurch is locked up until the press and politicos can make him into their kind of American hero at any cost. -  Brad Davis, Reed Birney, John McMartin", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
