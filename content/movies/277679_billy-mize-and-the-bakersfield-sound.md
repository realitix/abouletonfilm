An incredibly gifted musician and lyricist well loved and respected by his peers, Mize, a product of the Dust Bowl, was also a committed family man and the rare artist who traded in the road--and the wider fame that comes with it--for home. Even those who love fiercely are subject to tragedy, however, and Mize's life is equal parts triumph and pain.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
