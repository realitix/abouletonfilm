They fall in love, but can't elope because Piyal is of a lower class. Nanda's parents instead push her into a marriage with Jinadasa (Gamini Fonseka), who is of the same class as them. With economic downturn in Sri Lanka, both families lose their status and Jinadasa leaves to try to make a better life for himself; he never achieves his goal and dies penniless. Piyal and Nanda can now finally come together. They have changed however, and the earlier idylic nature of their relationship is not recaptured.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4DcE1EJBFvCmlM6ea6iQ2YdqPxo.jpg", "actors": ["Punya Hiendeniya (Nanda)", "Henry Jayasena (Pryal Weliweli)", "Wickrema Bogoda (Tissa)", "Trelicia Gunawardena (Anula)", "Gamini Fonseka (Jinadasa)", "Malini Fonseka ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [369800, 164384, 157236], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
