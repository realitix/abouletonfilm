What passions lie behind a person you would otherwise pass by without a thought? In a time of division, a time of mistrust, confusion and anguish it\u2019s time to start asking questions, to be curious and compassionate and discover the common nature that connects us all. Words. One cold, winters night in Leeds, England, we discovered Stan. We discovered love. We discovered anger. We discovered hidden talents. We discovered togetherness. We discovered poetry and passion. We discovered diversity. We discovered fish and chips. We discovered Stan's Fisheries. Extraordinary things exist in ordinary places. In a world of hope, a world of pain, a world of both tragedy and happiness, if you have the words, there's always a chance that you'll find the way to connect with people, everyday people. In times of division we must remember that we are far more united than things which divide us.
