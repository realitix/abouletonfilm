The year is 1992 and, in South Africa, radical change is in the air. The country may be on the bumpy road to an uncertain future, but Spud Milton is hoping for a smooth ride as he returns to boarding school as a senior. Instead, he discovers that his vindictive arch enemy is back to taunt him and that a garrulous Malawian has taken residence in his dormitory, along with the regular inmates and misfits he calls friends. Spud's world has never seemed less certain; he attempts to master Shakespeare, wrestles constantly with his God, and the power of negative thinking, and develops an aversion to fried fish after a shocking discovery about his grandmother, Wombat.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fUweNM8bDoY5MpMRQCQMGDPYb7Q.jpg", "actors": ["Troye Sivan (Spud)", "John Cleese (The Guv)", "Caspar Lee (Garlic)", "Sven Ruygrok (\"Rambo\" Clark)", "Byron Langley (Simon Brown)", "Blessing Xaba (\"Fatty\" Sibeko)", "Tom Burne (Vern \"Blackadder\" (as Thomas Burne))", "Travis Hornsby (\"Boggo\" Greenstein)", "Genna Blair (Mermaid)", "Alex McGregor (Christine)", "Aaron McIlroy (Dad Milton)", "Julie Summers (Mom Milton)", "Brenda Ngxoli (Innocence)", "Christine Le Brocq (Wombat)", "Graham Weir (Viking)", "Andr\u00e9 Jacobs (New Glock)", "Ben Vos (Mr Lilly)", "Mvelisi Mvandaba (\"Meany\" Dlamini)", "Laura Santoni (Librarian)", "Grant Swanby (Frank)", "Sonia Esgueira (Amber)", "Lizette Brewis (Myrtle)", "Luke Tyler (Norman Whiteside)", "Jonathan Briedenhann (Gavin)", "Mat Caldecott (Smarmy Lawyer)", "Cameron Williams (Thinny)", "Janu Lourens (\"Plump\" Graham)", "James Strahlendorf (Sidewinder)", "Ziyaad Gaibie (Stutterton)", "Matthew Burman (Rowdy)", "Anelisa Sintu (Meg Ryan's Son)", "Mathew Alves (Egg White)", "Michelle Bruno (Art Teacher)", "Martin Mostert (Bishop)", "Francis Chouler (Tipsy Man)", "Melain Thorne (Tipsy Woman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [200580, 61410, 257442, 23614], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
