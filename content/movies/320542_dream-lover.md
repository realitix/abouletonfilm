Jacklyn Wu stars as Kitty, a beautiful and wealthy woman who becomes the ideal love of Cheung Kar-shing (Tony Leung), an inventor who participates in illegal road races in his spare time. Their relationship blossoms into romance, but when Kitty's father goes into hiding and leaves behind over ten million dollars in unpaid debt, she leaves Hong Kong without telling Cheung where she's going. Shortly thereafter, Cheung strikes it rich when he is paid ten million dollars by a Japanese computer firm for a chip he has invented, but money does little to relieve his aching despair in Kitty's absence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2dqT2F5SZKNrMRo693NF8Q87GsI.jpg", "actors": ["Tony Leung Ka-Fai ()", "Wu Chien-Lien ()", "Pak-Cheung Chan ()", "Law Kar-Ying ()", "Jack Kao ()", "Lau Shun ()", "Spencer Lam ()", "Lee Siu-Kei ()", "Bruce Law ()", "Tang Lai-Man ()", "Lee Kong ()", "Heung Chin-Bong ()", "Chow Yee-Fan ()", "Esther Koo Yuk-Lin ()", "Aman Chang ()", "Kong-wah Lee ()", "John Cheung Chan-Sang ()", "Cheung Siu ()", "Chik King-Man ()", "Ernst Mausser ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
