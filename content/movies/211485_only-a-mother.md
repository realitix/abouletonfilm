The director uses this setting to decry the restrictive class structure that still existed in Sweden as late as the 1930s. Rya-Rya, the central character played by Eva Dahlbeck, is the mother of a large and ever-expanding brood. Rya-Rya must not only worry about putting food in the mouths of her children, but also reaching the inevitable day when she will have outgrown her usefulness to the landlords -- and must face the loss of her home and land. The drama is heightened by Rya-Rya's passion for two different men. Bara en Mor contained a bit of nudity that caused the film some problems when it was released in the U.S. as Only a Mother.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x8yltpFVU5S6kuYxcfLU8U4kUP6.jpg", "actors": ["Eva Dahlbeck (Maria, aka Rya-Rya)", "Ragnar Falck (Henrik, Rya-Rya's husband)", "Ulf Palme (Hammar)", "Hugo Bj\u00f6rne (Eniel)", "\u00c5ke Fridell (Inspector)", "Mona Geijer-Falkner (Emili)", "Max von Sydow (Nils)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
