The film is a panorama of emotionally charged recollections of strange relatives and estranged siblings, staged recreations of fast-fading pasts and personal mythologies, and reflections on the anxious states created by the body's fragile claims on time and space. It's about being a stranger in your own skin. Panic Bodies perfects the phantom quality of any good work about mourning, but it is not reducible to that. It is also enlivened by the intimacy that comes from having made a spectacle of personal secrets.\" (Kathleen Pirrie Adams, Xtra)", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Moucle Blackout ()", "Jason Boughton ()", "Tom Chomont ()", "Janieta Eyre ()", "Ed Johnson ()", "Kathryn Ramey ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
