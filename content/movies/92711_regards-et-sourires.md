Mick lives with his parents, works on his motorbike, looks for work, and every two weeks gets his check from the dole. There are no jobs. His best mate Alan joins the army to fix tanks and is sent to Belfast to quell Catholics. At a disco, Mick meets Karen, who works at a shoe shop and lives with her recently-separated mom. Karen misses her dad. She offers Mick emotional stability and a route to adulthood; Alan pitches the army. Does Mick have a future?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ewIQQJKxz7R4rvfxMigKsXubXK.jpg", "actors": ["Graham Green (Michael 'Mick' Walsh)", "Carolyn Nicholson (Karen Lodge)", "Tony Pitts (Alan Wright)", "Roy Haywood (Phil)", "Phil Askham (Mr Walsh)", "Pam Darrell (Mrs Walsh)", "Tracey Goodlad (Julie)", "Patti Nicholls (Mrs Wright)", "Cilla Mason (Mrs Lodge)", "Les Hickin (George)", "Arthur Davies (Eric Lodge)", "Deirdre Costello (Jenny)", "Jackie Shinn (Gatekeeper)", "Christine Francis (Careers Officer)", "Rita May (Receptionist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [118136, 199184, 198790, 78815], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
