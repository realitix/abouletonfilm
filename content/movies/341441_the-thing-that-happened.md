Hope North struggles on a shoe-string budget to provide a home and an education for children displaced by the civil war between the Lord's Resistance Army (L.R.A.) and the Uganda People's Defense Forces (U.D.P.F.) The students are a mix of former child soldiers, orphans and the abjectly poor. Mitigating the horrific effects of the war and focusing them on their future is a monumental task", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pwumA8kb4RzJIHWOby6K98XJ0hl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
