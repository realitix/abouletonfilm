The work, centered on a mad king and his delusions, was rarely played after its premiere in 1814. This performance marked the first from the critical new edition at the 2010 Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro and was hailed as a \"perfect symbiosis of music and stage work\" resulting in \"truly brilliant theatre.\" Complete with a cast of sought-after Rossini singers, this is not to be missed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gfIPxUwX4tLBUI9QzawEGu05fyN.jpg", "actors": ["Daniela Barcellona (Sigismondo)", "Andrea Concetti (Ulderico)", "Olga Peretyatko (Aldimira)", "Antonino Siragusa (Ladislao)", "Manuela Bisceglie (Anagilda)", "Andrea Concetti (Zenovito)", "Enea Scala (Radoski)", "Michele Mariotti (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
