Based on expert advice and meticulous research, Blackout combines real user-generated footage, alongside fictional scenes, CCTV archive and news reports to build a terrifyingly realistic account of Britain being plunged into darkness.  The film plots the days following a nationwide power cut, as experienced by a cast of ordinary characters struggling to feed and protect themselves and their families. These eyewitness accounts reveal the disastrous impact of a prolonged blackout on hospitals, law and order, transport, and our food and water supplies.  The programme casts members of the public from user-generated footage, weaving real-life archive with scripted drama to tell the story of how Britain could descend into chaos and anarchy without power.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5jPehoZD9tJSF3MjxsiSvDO9HiZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [103194, 322506], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
