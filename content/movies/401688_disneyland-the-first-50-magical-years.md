This was shown only at the Main Street Opera House in Disneyland park, where the \"Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln\" attraction is usually featured. It was screened from 5 May 2005 until early 2008. It can still be viewed in the lobby, but the main theater is once again the Mr. Lincoln show.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tKWVmUFsoOdr3rkxPLzbDNWr2TJ.jpg", "actors": ["Jeff Lam ()", "Tony Anselmo (Donald Duck (voice))", "Cameron Lee ()", "Steve Martin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
