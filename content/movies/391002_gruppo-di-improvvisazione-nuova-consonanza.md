The players showcased here include Bertoncini, Branchi, Evangelisti, Heineman, Kayn, Morricone, Vandor and Frederic Rzewski. It's interesting to watch the composers interact and perform spontaneously as it is to see them preparing the piano by tying horsehair around the strings and rubbing the interior with empty plastic bottles and vaccuum cleaner attachments.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oODz2OhUND3dtOzbNNWpUOPZ0Lu.jpg", "actors": ["Ennio Morricone (Himself)", "Walter Branchi (Himself)", "Frederic Rzewski (Himself)", "Mario Bertoncini (Himself)", "Franco Evengelisti (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
