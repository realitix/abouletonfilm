Just as the club faced liquidation, they were bought by billionaire businessmen. Filmed in an observational fashion from a poetic distance, the documentary follows the larger than life and high profile characters who put their money and reputations on the line through 4 tumultuous years of enormous ups and downs. For 98 dramatic minutes we are given unprecedented access and remarkable insight into the worlds of sport, business, finance, power and ego - culminating in success in 2011, when QPR won promotion to the Premier League and the four year plan - set out by the owners in 2007 - was spectacularly achieved.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2qMGni2LnLx9DsTUnRcuEgKhVVB.jpg", "actors": ["Flavio Briatore (Himself)", "Alejandro Agag (Himself)", "Gareth Ainsworth (Himself)", "Amit Bhatia (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "g5LJzt1F3JE"}
