This program explores the feasibility of constructing several extraordinary projects such as a Europe to Africa Bridge or a tunnel across the Straights of Gibraltar. Could engineers really construct a mile high skyscraper or floating ocean cities? State of the art computer graphics and real world scientists help to explain these technological dreams. Current engineering advances, like revolutionary new vacuum, make these engineering marvel's a distinct possibility!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zRPhhFij8Tg4Nn86TA7djd9zGCt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
