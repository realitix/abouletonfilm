Just as she is finally at the apex of her chosen second field, Judit encounters male jealously and/or aggression in the form of intentional snubs from this different class of snobs, or in the worse instances, rape. Director Kitty Kino portrays many of the male figures in this film as weak, or drunk, or simply offensive, and because of the emphasis on those traits, the film will raise objections from some viewers. On the other hand, many women might see this film and feel that at least it brings up the difficulties women can face in getting ahead in a male-dominated arena, instead of side-stepping or ignoring the role of male prejudice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9rtEnRHNJK2cTg2F72injxiv5Wq.jpg", "actors": ["Marie Colbin (Judit)", "Ren\u00e9e Felden (Lilo)", "Gerhard R\u00fchmkorf (Ernstl)", "Florent\u00edn Groll (Hans)", "Helfried Edlinger (Max)", "Wilfried Baasner (King)", "Robert Hunger-B\u00fchler ()", "Susanne Czepl ()", "Hubert Kramar (Mike)", "Beatrice Frey (Angelika)", "Lotte Loebenstein (Puppi)", "Maria Martina ()", "Johannes Thanheiser ()", "Christine Jirku ()", "Manfred Schmid ()", "Gerhard Swoboda (Spieler)", "Kurt Nachmann ()", "Dietrich Siegl ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
