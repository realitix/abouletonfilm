I had the pleasure of visiting El Teide.  Spain\u00b4s highest mountain @(3718m) is one of the best places in the world to photograph the stars and is also the location of Teide Observatories, considered to be one of the world\u00b4s best observatories.  The goal was to capture the beautiful Milky Way galaxy along with one of the most amazing mountains I know El Teide. I have to say this was one of the most exhausting trips I have done. There was a lot of hiking at high altitudes and probably less than 10 hours of sleep in total for the whole week. Having been here 10-11 times before I had a long list of must-see locations I wanted to capture for this movie, but I am still not 100% used to carrying around so much gear required for time-lapse movies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ul9pj5ZToFqchdY20VugLcBU6IL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
