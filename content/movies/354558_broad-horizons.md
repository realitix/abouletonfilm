Its subject matter was contemporary, rather than being a historical piece or an action drama set among the partisans of World War II. In the story, a dockworker sees that a crane, a crucial piece of shipyard equipment, is being endangered by a violent storm, and despite considerable danger to himself works to save it. ~ Clarke Fountain, Rovi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8OOrofjuI2xN2tgccutmis6aR22.jpg", "actors": ["Dhimit\u00ebr Orgocka (Urani)", "Sand\u00ebr Prosi (Kapiten Zylo)", "Robert Ndrenika (Azemi)", "Pandi Raidhi (Ymeri)", "Sulejman Pitarka (Sokrat Dh\u00ebmbo)", "Nikolin Xhoja (Kuzhinieri)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
