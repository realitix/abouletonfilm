And trick film it is. The 30-second work is shown twice in case the viewer missed something the first time: in crude hand-drawn animation Zeichenfilm ... evokes the scatological sado-masochistic actions and performances of Otto Muehl and G\u00fcnter Brus which Kren filmed during his second period. In Zeichenfilm Balzac a male figure hangs himself, achieves a monstrous erection and ejaculates into a woman's mouth. She in turn hangs herself; he enters her vaginally then anally. Finally, she defecates on the left side of the frame wherein appears an eye of God while on the right in a cartoon box the words \"Aber Otto\" (\"But Otto\") materialize, a comic reference to Otto Muehl.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/akGG6hcicKw88ls8bo2hSQ0ahJI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
