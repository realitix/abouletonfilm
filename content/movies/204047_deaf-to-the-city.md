Gloria, who runs the place, earns most of her money as a stripper. She lives there with her two daughters and a son with an untreated brain tumor. Charlie, who is forever in and out of jail, is Gloria's sometime lover. A recent check-in is there hoping she can work up the courage to commit suicide, since her rich doctor husband ran off and left her. Another resident is Tim, who keeps company with his dog and his booze in equal measure. A schoolteacher comes by from time to time, hoping to do these people some good, but in choosing this lot to work with, she proves to be just as much of a loser as the rest of them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e1bNQ12jzRVtbcFWlmNVZcUuSmS.jpg", "actors": ["Ang\u00e8le Coutu ()", "Guillaume Lemay-Thivierge ()", "Sophie L\u00e9ger ()", "Han Masson ()", "B\u00e9atrice Picard ()", "Pierre Th\u00e9riault ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
