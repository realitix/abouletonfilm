After saving a crooked businessman in a warehouse, they are surprised by three pretty girls and a leather-jacketed boyfriend who are searching for a party. Evidently, they have unwittingly unleashed a kind of portal, endangering us all. Our heroes spend the night trying to survive, as one of the three women has been targeted as a \"breeder.\" She has apparently been chosen for being pretty tough - after all, she does the equivalent of shrugging her shoulders after witnessing her businessman father getting horribly decapitated just inches away.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u0U0MX5WlWR6C0FB5Qzf1inDK0w.jpg", "actors": ["Bill White (Ivan)", "Ed Hubbard (Harry)", "Wendy Bednarz (Kirsten)", "Rick Poli (Albert)", "Anna Dipace (Linda)", "Suzanne Scott (Jennifer)", "Laura McLauchlin (Rosa)", "Kevin J.
