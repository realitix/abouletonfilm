He had pulled this kind of caper a hundred times. Kent didn't need a partner, but he couldn't resist sharing the experience with Kim, the diner waitress who could make his operation a whole lot easier. So why did Kent find himself holed up in a retirement home with a wounded woman, a man gunning for him and a group of senior citizens asking him to fix their AC? Would Kent let his greed do him in? Or would he find redemption?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3SytUtT5EklcRRICo5aLWiye4Vp.jpg", "actors": ["James E.
