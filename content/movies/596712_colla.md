Domenico is 19 years old and has a turbulent life. After an argument with his parents he has spent most of the night wandering around. He looks for hospitality at the Antonio\u2019s house, an old friend. Antonio lets him sleep in the room with his 14 year-old brother, Lallo. As soon as Domenico and Lallo are left alone, they begin walking around on a sunny and fringe Procida. Both of them with their own baggage of questions and uncertainties. Their encounter with Sarah, a transsexual woman, with her wisdom and sincerity, will mark an important time of growth and freedom for both. Only next morning, when the sun has taken away all dreams, Domenico and Lallo will separate. An adventurous and touching journey through adolescence, in an area where boundaries are marked hard by the sea.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/umtp5XpIQkt9EDscvltkkXzO7ZV.jpg", "actors": ["Domenico Nappa ()", "Giuseppe Orsillo ()", "Loredana Simioli ()", "Sara Carbone ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
