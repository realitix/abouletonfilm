Videoplasty was released at the end of 1998 to compliment to the band's recent covers EP Rhinoplasty, and is composed mostly of highlights from a live show performed on October 14 that year at The Phoenix Theater in Petaluma, California. This live footage is interspersed with montages of clips filmed during previous tours and at other recent shows, footage shot backstage and in the studio, animations by bassist Les Claypool, and the band's then-current music videos, spanning back two years to the recording of the Brown Album and presented in approximate reverse-chronological order.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zsJyaf0tbU1gpuqocte78eZaUgU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
