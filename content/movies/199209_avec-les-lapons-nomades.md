In Disneyesque fashion, the film details the day-to-day existence of the Norwegian Laplanders. The \"story\" concentrates on the annual odyssey wherein the Lapland reindeer are shepherded to snow-free grazing lands. Not surprisingly, director Per Host is more fascinated with the reindeer than with the human characters -- and, by extension, so is the audience. The film was lensed in economical Eastmancolor, meaning that most existing prints have washed out over the past 40 years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qUT1nAQc1sWOR5TAI3VnSf5MdHP.jpg", "actors": ["Karen Anna Logje (Rauna)", "Klemet Veimel (Nilas)", "Matti Mikkel Sara (Matti)", "Jon Luoso (Heika)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
