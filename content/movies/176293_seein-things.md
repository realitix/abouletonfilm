His mom tells him to stay away from the stuff but he loves it so much he sneaks out of the house and ends up eating several chickens. That night she puts him to bed and sure enough he begins to have nightmares that the other kids are chasing him. Basing a kids comedy around one kid having nightmares and being stalked by other kids might seem rather bizarre but this was 1924 we're talking about.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Sunshine Sammy Morrison (Ernie (as Hal Roach's Rascals))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
