I enjoyed AVATAR and HUGO, though not much else among the movies I\u2019ve seen in illusionary depth. They place things in depth but don\u2019t go at depth as a realm to be investigated, toyed with; no mindbenders other than story. Cezanne, Cubism, never happened. This movie begins to play with possibility, with things only sometimes appearing real.\" - Ken Jacobs", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
