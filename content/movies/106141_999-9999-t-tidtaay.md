She soon becomes the center of attention, since so many of her new friends are curious to know about the recent death of a student at her old school in the North. She blames it on a mysterious phone number - 999-9999 - a number reputed to grant whoever calls it, one wish. Her classmate apparently had called the number and had his wish granted...soon after, he was found dead on a flagpole. Despite Rainbow's repeated warnings, many of her new classmates decide to try this out. Although the various wishes are fulfilled, a series of accident-like deaths occur, until Sun becomes the only teen in the group left alive. Death is awaiting him, however, as he has also made a wish which has yet to be fulfilled. Together, Rainbow and Sun must solve the mystery of the evil phone number, and stop whatever it is from killing them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ijNjGWN0QDvIgv9i3L5xXM7rUpd.jpg", "actors": ["Chulachak Chakrabongse (Sun)", "Sririta Jensen (Roong)", "Paula Taylor (Mena)", "Worajan Sangngern (Wawa)", "Rawit Riwin (Moo-Preaw)", "Titinun Keatanakorn (Ra-Jit)", "Thepparit Riwin (Ah-Chi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [75561, 105546, 267458, 72042], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
