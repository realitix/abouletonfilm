The hero, dress designer Jerry McGuire (William Collier Jr.), is tired of being considered a wimp. After business hours, Jerry secretly takes boxing lessons, enabling him to knock the stuffings out of his burly rival Spike Mullins (Johnnie Walker). Jerry's newfound pugilistic skills wins him the affections of store clerk Hilda Jensen (Shirley Mason), who's just car-razy about \"cave men.\" Filmed in a fast three weeks, So This is Love? was completed before Frank Capra's Matinee Idol but released afterward. Leading lady Shirley Mason was the sister of Viola Dana, who starred in Capra's initial Columbia effort, That Certain Thing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uUKQmMYCJ7n59y9xgybrK0SCW8C.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
