A small suburban town is practically in marshall law because of a serial killer who can\u2019t be caught. Police have the streets under constant surveillance, but nothing, no sign of them.  Home Sweet Home throws us right in the middle of a night where the killer has chosen a new family of unsuspecting victims. This little horror-thriller packs quite the punch with an ending you\u2019ll never see coming.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ivpmW0vK5Lo84uEJxQULXKcz2GK.jpg", "actors": ["Amanda Stewart (Katie Sade)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
