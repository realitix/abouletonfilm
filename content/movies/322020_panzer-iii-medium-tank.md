Though it could easily hold its own against the Allied forces' tanks, the Panzer III met its match on the Eastern Front against the Russian T-34. By the end of the war, it had been shifted to secondary fronts and was often used as a command tank rather than on the main battlefield.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
