Kazumi's younger and more inexperienced husband Hideo is continually suspicious of her fidelity, for no good reason at all. In one scene, Hideo locks himself in a room while in a fit of pique and Kazumi simply breaks down the door. When Kazumi gets pregnant and then suffers an accident, one might think that a tearful reconciliation between husband and wife would carry the day .", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3J0OMD8jzRw2ciSWp0Q9XGLy2gW.jpg", "actors": ["Reiko \u00d4hara (Kazumi Hyuga)", "Kaoru Kobayashi (Hideo Hyuga)", "Miyoko Akaza (Kazumi's Older Sister)", "Kawarasaki Kenzo (Hideo's Older Brother)", "Michiko Araki (Kazumi's Mother)", "Hatsunori Hasegawa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
