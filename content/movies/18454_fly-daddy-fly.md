The assailant, Ishihara, son of a politician, brazenly mocks Suzuki as he throws him cover-up money. Angry, Suzuki finds he has no answer to Ishihara and in venting his anger, loses his daughter\u2019s trust too. A sleep-deprived, crazed Suzuki goes to Ishihara\u2019s school wielding a knife. He does not find Ishihara, but instead forms an alliance with an odd group of school misfits called the Zombies. The group\u2019s elusive leader, Pak Sun Shin, decides to train Suzuki, who quits his job and embarks on a punishing programme to win back freedom for his daughter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AsjDbUF6xFRlMJQD8lxeF44SRAn.jpg", "actors": ["Junichi Okada ()", "Shinichi Tsutsumi ()", "Munetaka Aoki ()", "Mire Aika ()", "Kazuyuki Asano ()", "Nanase Hoshii ()", "Hiroshi Kanbe ()", "Sh\u00f4ji K\u00f4kami ()", "Toshinobu Matsuo ()", "Morooka Moro ()", "Hiroshi \u00d4k\u00f4chi ()", "Makoto Sakamoto ()", "Sansei Shiomi ()", "Genki Sudo ()", "Hiromasa Taguchi ()", "Asuka Shibuya ()", "Yu Tokui ()", "Takaya Aoyagi ()", "Tsuyoshi Hirose ()", "Youichi Nukumizu ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
