Their goal was to make a movie about a young actress struggling to make her dreams come true. . For eleven days, these filmmakers roamed across deserts, canyons, salt flats and snowy mountains. Their script was little more than a rough outline, so they carried on down the road, stopping to shoot a scene whenever they felt the magic of a particular location. Road to Sundance is a surreal and imperfect film, a project born of passion and instinct that celebrates the power of following our dreams.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sw8rUQg3eNU5TvQTyl2ppW1mtEf.jpg", "actors": ["Stacey Ann Shevlin ()", "Tiffani Fest ()", "Ben Wise ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
