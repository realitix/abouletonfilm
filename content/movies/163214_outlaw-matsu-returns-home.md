I found several of them who had remained in Thailand. Two years later, I invited one of them to make his first return visit to Japan and documented it in Outlaw-Matsu Returns Home. During the filming, my subject Fujita asked me to buy him a cleaver so that he could kill his \u2018vicious brother.\u2019 I was shocked, and asked him to wait a day so that I could plan how to film the scene. By the next morning, to my relief, Fujita had calmed down and changed his mind about killing his brother. But I couldn\u2019t have had a sharper insight into the ethical questions provoked by this kind of documentary filmmaking.\u201d \u2014Sh\u00f4hei Imamura", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6LNUWBaKZsfnSvx9Bz5TO5vGcQv.jpg", "actors": ["Sh\u014dhei Imamura (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
