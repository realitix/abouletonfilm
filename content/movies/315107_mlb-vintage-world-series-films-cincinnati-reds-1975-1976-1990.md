After an extra-innings defeat in Game 6 the night before, the Reds trailed 3-0 in Game 7, but like true champions, they battled back to win the game and take home the series.  The taut drama of the previous season's finale was replaced by an awesome display of professionalism and dominance in the 1976 World Series as the Reds swept the star-struck New York Yankees.  Fourteen years later, the Reds again swept their opponent, but this time it was a significant upset. The defending champion Oakland Athletics were out-pitched and out-played over four games as the Red Legs completed their wire-to-wire season with their fifth championship in franchise history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/edLgxhYkNMyRplBpX71O9huTm1r.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
