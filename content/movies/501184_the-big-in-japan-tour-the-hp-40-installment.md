Guided by the local daimyo (Naoya Naito), our heroes travel through lush forests, remote sulphur mountains and slick river beds to discover the hidden gems of Japan. Along the way they meet a legendary warrior (Yuji Hirayama) eager to trade techniques. In The HP 40 Installment: Recently opened to bouldering, HorsePens40 quickly established itself as one of the premium bouldering areas in the USA. Shot in December 2003, this installment features 3 short movies focusing on different aspects of the game. First we got Jason Kehl working God Module, the best problem in the park. Then it is a medley of climbers and problems shot during the annual Mortal Kombat competition.
