Taped at New York City's Beacon Theatre before a live audience, Ellen DeGeneres: Here and Now features the kind of humor that first made her a star, offering her offbeat insights into everyday life. Her feel-good humor touches on something that anyone can identify with, be it the obligatory gay joke, procrastination, fashion, public cell phone use, airline etiquette, or self-esteem.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rge5NdLl5GDlKla2equiQmeuNAa.jpg", "actors": ["Ellen DeGeneres (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [26366, 36536, 48288, 255466], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
