When the other ducklings are learning to fly so they can go south for the winter, Dinky lies under a shade tree sniffing the autumn air. He learns his lesson when the others fly south and he is left behind in the winter cold. But he luckily wins a free airplane-trip in a poetry contest and beats them there.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
