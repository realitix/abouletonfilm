Using the sound track, \u201cThe Flowers of all Cities,\u201d a famous song by Fairuz, the film presents a harmonious picture of Palestinian civil life in Jerusalem that is disturbed by the Israeli army\u2019s occupation of the city following the 1967 war.  Although essentially a propaganda film by the Jordanian Ministry of Culture, the film captures the essence of the period, the way in which Palestinians and Arabs viewed Jerusalem, and their rage at its occupation by the Israeli army. Given recent events, the film continues to hold contemporary relevance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lBmMBQJFvAkaLzcghNyShDhIB8V.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
