Jabe measures 6ft 2inches (188cm), works as a dominatrix and lives on the margins, defying society's expectations of the 'normal' 'feminine' body and sexuality. Jabe Babe also has a life threatening genetic condition called Marfan Syndrome, a connective tissue disorder which affects one in three thousand people. This hybrid documentary film, merging fiction and non-fiction forms, inhabits the heightened technicolour world of the tall woman, the outsider, to boldly provoke questions on society's desire for sexual, visual, and genetic conformity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/78lQowBiRtC8NdfeDNd7OQ1xVY7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
