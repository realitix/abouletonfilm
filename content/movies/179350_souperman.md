It tells the story of Superman -- but with a torrid twist. Marc Stevens stars as the swarthy superhero, dedicating himself to solving the city's sexual problems. His arch-enemy is Roger Caine, a villain who hates sex and wants it to stop. But whenever he tries a stunt, Superman appears and gets everyone in a happy, horny mood again! Meanwhile, a local skin mag is planning to publish nude photos of the Caped Crusader! What would Lois think? Sure, it's silly, but the flick is filled with feverish action and plenty of naturally delectable 70s starlets like Susan McBain and Gloria Leonard, so who's complaining?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5IFgyflrRt37G1hKeB0c688IjgN.jpg", "actors": ["Marc Stevens (Souperman / Clark Bent)", "Susan McBain (Lois Lewd)", "Eric Edwards (Jimmy)", "Jake Teague (The Chief (as Jack Teague))", "Pola Black (Molly)", "Roger Caine (Luther)", "Brenda Basse (Andrea)", "Gloria Leonard (Bobo Fockefeller)", "Judith Florez (Maria)", "Jennifer Jordan (Girl on Street)", "Foster Thomas (Black Guy on Street)", "Crystal Sync (Girl with Clark (as Sharon Rose))", "Jack Acorn (White Guy on Street)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
