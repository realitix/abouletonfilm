In the tradition of SPELLBOUND-with a little of GATES OF HEAVEN thrown in for good measure-comes a feature documentary about three remarkably rich and diverse personalities who come together to compete in their shared passion to raise the perfect chicken. The film will follow the struggles and triumphs of these characters, along with a wide array of competitors-both human and chicken-from the Ohio National Poultry Show, considered the Westminster of Chickens, to the Dixie Classic in Tennessee.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p1AcRC8goa48jzHZSUEshu2HHCr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "S9ZShxa6wJ0"}
