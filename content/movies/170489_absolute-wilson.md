As much a tale of social injustice as a portrait of an artist, this mix of interviews and live performance is testimony to how Wilson's early challenges influenced his creative expression.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9g2iFj2BiFbshpMqwiInMZQA71c.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Wilson ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
