Just before they start, Luisa, who is playing Rosalind, makes a bad decision \u2013 to terminate her relationship via mobile phone. Torn between her work and her personal preoccupations, in something of a daze, Luisa goes from wardrobe tests to dialogue review and a rehearsal that confirms Rosalind as the object of desire for the entire cast: Celia, Orlando, Febe. When rehearsals are over, there is a barbeque, and Luisa finds her fellow actors planning a day in the country with their partners. This offers her a chance to overcome her loneliness, though she still harbours hopes of a phone call. \u2013Locarno Film Festival  Mat\u00edas Pi\u00f1eiro\u2019s Rosalinda, an original meditation on Shakespeare\u2019s As You Like It, is a rich and enjoyable work that sustains a brisk comic tempo in a mellow, sunlit atmosphere", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lA06paOybwb58vkVVF9IgufiYqs.jpg", "actors": ["Mar\u00eda Villar (Rosalinda / Luisa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
