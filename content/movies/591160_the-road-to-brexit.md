Through creative use of archive footage and filmed interviews, The Road To Brexit unashamedly plays fast and loose with the facts to create a joyously surreal whistle stop tour of Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe, from the 1950s right up to Brexit.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7cPVVxY0VmoMBM9NzHZPJhk1Zs3.jpg", "actors": ["Matt Berry (Michael Squeamish)", "Felicity Montagu (Jill Spiller MP)", "Alex MacQueen (Tony Braxton MP)", "Phil Wang (Rob Codex-Forrester)", "Natasia Demetriou (Jemima Codex-Forrester)", "Simon Greenall (Vox Pop Peter)", "Ann Mitchell (Vox Pop Pamela)", "Paul Putner (Musician)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
