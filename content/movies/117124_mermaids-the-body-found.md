In this story, startling amateur video and photographic evidence, as well as additional audio recordings, suggests whales weren\u2019t the only creatures affected by the Navy\u2019s sonar. The film follows the two scientists who tracked the whale beachings for years and delivers first-hand, on-camera accounts of what they claim to have discovered in the aftermath of one particular beaching.
