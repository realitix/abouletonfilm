The residents of the \u201cenemy\u201d town are ridiculed at every chance the residents of the other village can get to do so.  And it\u2019s no different, when Rott is getting ready to celebrate the 300th anniversary of its founding.  The residents of Strasslach ridicule their neighbors, because the Rotters don\u2019t want to celebrate the anniversary, because it\u2019ll cost money.  Even the church doesn\u2019t have an organ, because that would cost money, too.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dr40ttD3pnNWflppbiahhLqjCx6.jpg", "actors": ["Willy R\u00f6sner (B\u00fcrgermeister Zirngibl)", "Maria Andergast (Gertrud, seine Tochter)", "Gustav Waldau (Mathias Kammreiter)", "Hilde Sessak (Bienchen - ihre Tochter)", "Beppo Brem (Nepomuk)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
