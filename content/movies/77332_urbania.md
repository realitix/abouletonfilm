His encounters are planned and chance: with a homeless man who sleeps by his building, with a friend who's dying, with the couple who lives (and noisily loves) in the flat above him, with a bartender and a one-night-stand he follows home, and with a tattooed stranger whom he seeks out and befriends. Along the way, Charlie inhabits a city full of moments of violence and of stories and legends: a kidney thief, a microwaved poodle, a rat in a hot dog bun, a baby left on a car top, a tourist's toothbrush, needles in public-phone change slots. Charlie lives and tells his own stories. What caused his melancholy?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qL2vKjQKgTzGUGXcsyBftUiwpLw.jpg", "actors": ["Dan Futterman (Charlie)", "Matt Keeslar (Steve)", "Samuel Ball (Dean)", "Lothaire Bluteau (Bill)", "Alan Cumming (Brett)", "Josh Hamilton (Matt)", "James Simon (Sam)", "Megan Dodds (Deedee)", "Gabriel Olds (Ron)", "Barbara Sukowa (Clara - The Married Woman)", "Gerry Bamman (Don)", "Pamela Shaw (Judy - The Photo Lady)", "Christopher Bradley (Efraim - The Window Couple)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [59418, 177919, 77436, 32728], "youtube_key": "sBaoJ1qb5p8"}
