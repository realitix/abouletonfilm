Shortly before his death, Fejos tells his life story. His voice, the melody of his Hungarian-accented English, his humour and his ability to tell stories lead us through the short documentation. Then it becomes an ethno-drama. The film travels from Sweden to Siam and poetically and powerfully shows how much work it is for a young couple to produce a handful of rice.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
