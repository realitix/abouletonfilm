The film portrays an Indian tribe, the Mimbreno Appacheans, who are celebrating their Thanksgiving, building an irrigation plant, carrying on commerce, and trying to settle down in a rather constricted territory. But the confrontation with the white Americans changes their situation as the mercantile \"gentlemen\" want to prevent the Indian tribe to become independent from the white men\u2032s business practices. Thus, they destroy the irrigation plant and chase the Indian tribe in an inhospitable territory where they cannot survive. Led by their chief Ulzana, the Appacheans thus start a bitter fight to preserve their habitat.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dd4ZV97PPph89YaksqfzduUvAoT.jpg", "actors": ["Gojko Miti\u0107 (Ulzana)", "Renate Blume (Leona)", "Rolf Hoppe (Captain Burton)", "Colea R\u0103utu (Nana)", "Paul Berndt (Wardley, Tucson-Reiter)", "Amza Pellea ()", "Fred Delmare ()", "Alfred Struwe ()", "Hannjo Hasse ()", "Werner Dissel ()", "Fritz Mohr ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
