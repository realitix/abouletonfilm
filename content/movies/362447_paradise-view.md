Taking place shortly before the resumption of Japanese sovereignty over Okinawa, Takamine\u2019s film tacitly addresses the island prefecture's complicated history of occupation and feelings of dislocation through the story of a small community and its preparations for a wedding between a local girl and a Japanese teacher. On the periphery of these events is Reishu (Kaoru Kobayashi), who quits his job on a US military base and uses the extra time to catch snakes and play with ants \u2013 and get the bride-to-be pregnant. Takamine\u2019s leisurely-paced film is full of uniquely Okinawan touches that mix in aspects of the island's folklore, accompanied by Haruomi Hosono\u2019s spare and evocative score.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2rH6kXKik1zivCmpKqtyqLdPXRq.jpg", "actors": ["Kaoru Kobayashi (Reishu Goya)", "Jun Togawa (Chiru)", "Haruomi Hosono (Ito)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
