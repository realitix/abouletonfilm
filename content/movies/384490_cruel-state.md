The tragedy left life-long wounds in the hearts of people whose family and friends had been among the 304 passengers killed. The majority of the victims were high school students on a school trip. Their parents were not even given the luxury of grieving, as they had to camp out in front of the Parliament, City Hall and the Presidential House, asking for only one thing - to know the truth about why their children had been left to die. But after more than a year, that truth has yet to be brought to light. This film is a documentation of the year-long struggle and painful soul-searching of people destined to be labelled as 'bereaved families' for the rest of their lives, as they come face to face with the naked face of their cruel country.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/llc9PvucdroMNPyDPDPLXMqeBI3.jpg", "actors": ["Pope Francis (Himself)", "Moon Jae-in (Himself)", "Moon So-ri (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
