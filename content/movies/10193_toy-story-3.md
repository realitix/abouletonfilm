The story flowed really well with the two Toy Story movies. And just like the two other movies, it was funny, has a lot of action and adventure, and it was really touching.\r\n\r\n\r\nI guess at some point, everyone was able to relate to the story. That's why it's so great. It's great for young children and really great for adults. It's a good ending for the Toy Story movies. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy rate for this movie is A."}], "recommandations_id": [863, 862, 585, 920], "youtube_key": "TNMpa5yBf5o"}
