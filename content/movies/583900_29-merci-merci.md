Between those early works and MERCI, Hindle was sought to film the Winter Olympics, 150 short works for Westinghouse/CBS, and the South Sea voyages of Sterling Hayden's schooner, \"Wanderer.\" The inability to get on with his own work produced MERCI. A poignant comment concerning the film artist's dilemma. Aftermaths of Western Civilization. Including never-seen-elsewhere Nazi footage inserts.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
