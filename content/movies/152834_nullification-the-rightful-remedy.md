Do we ask federal judges in black robes to enforce the limits of federal power? Do we \"vote the bums out\" in the hopes that new bums will surrender their power? Thomas Jefferson and James Madison didn't think so, and neither should we.  The rightful remedy to federal tyranny rests in the hands of the people and the States that created the federal government in the first place.  It's called nullification, and it's an idea whose time has come.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iS9f5JtWj3rSKKsJOxmLJSPZ0XU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "3kdiW6t0-PY"}
