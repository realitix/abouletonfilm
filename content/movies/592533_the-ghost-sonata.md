He makes the acquaintance of the mysterious Jacob Hummel, who helps him to find his way into the apartment, only to find that it is a nest of betrayal and sickness. The world, the student learns, is hell and human beings must suffer to achieve salvation. The play centers on a family of strangers who meet for the sake of meeting. They exchange no dialogue, nor gestures, they simply sit and bask in their own misfortune.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dgcc1C58ZGdbFAWRIlwvnI7OUbV.jpg", "actors": ["Allan Edwall (Gubben)", "Stefan Ekman (Studenten)", "Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand (\u00d6versten)", "Ulla Sj\u00f6blom (Mumien)", "Marie G\u00f6ranzon (Fr\u00f6ken)", "Per Myrberg (Johansson)", "Sture Ericson (Bengtsson)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
