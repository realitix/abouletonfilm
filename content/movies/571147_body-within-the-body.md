The soundtrack, which consists of a voice speaking the single words \u2018house', \u2018woman', \u2018head' and \u2018breath', intensifies the feeling of slowness, heaviness and materiality. The camera seems like a body let loose on its surroundings, concentrating on just a few objects, processes and views as it slowly feels its way around. The voice, in turn, appears to represent a kind of interior dialogue, a \u2018body within a body'.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
