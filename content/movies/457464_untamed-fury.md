Jeff returns home from college with an engineering degree and dreams of bringing modern medical care and education to the swamps. He is immediately confronted by his old boyhood rival, \"Gator-Bait\" Blair, who thinks things are just fine the way the are. \"Gator\" whips the ignorant locals into a frenzy of fear and resistance.
