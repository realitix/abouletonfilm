Intimate and revealing, but never rude.  A moving and human portrait of a group of unemployed and above all lonely men who stayed behind when their wives moved to the city looking for work. They worked in the timber industry in the province of Heilongjiang, but deforestation has taken its toll. For instance, we see 46-year-old San Liangzi. Twelve years ago, he divorced his wife and became unemployed. For 10 years, he has had an eye on Wang Meizi, the only unmarried woman in the area. But the love is not mutual.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u0iED5mhOczADyzcbkWm8yIMFPc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
