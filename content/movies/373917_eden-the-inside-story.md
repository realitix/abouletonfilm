Life at Eden was filmed day after day from before the pit was even bought to the day it opened to a blaze of worldwide publicity. The Eden Project is a visitor attraction in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. Inside the artificial biomes are plants that are collected from all around the world. The project is located in a reclaimed Kaolinite pit, located 2 km (1.2 mi) from the town of St. Blazey and 5 km (3 mi) from the larger town of St Austell, Cornwall. The complex is dominated by two huge enclosures consisting of adjoining domes that house thousands of plant species, and each enclosure emulates a natural biome. The domes consist of hundreds of hexagonal and pentagonal, inflated, plastic cells supported by steel frames. The first dome emulates a tropical environment, and the second a Mediterranean environment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lPvOur82lt6Ewfm0G8ia5Fd2Q2h.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
