The result is a dazzling vibration of geometric forms in vivid color, an effect achieved by varying the speed at which alternate colors change, so producing optical illusions.

Sound effects are created by registering sound shapes directly on the soundtrack of the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/20locbllQsvGBxU4REl84NklipU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "vbcfm_HILu0"}
