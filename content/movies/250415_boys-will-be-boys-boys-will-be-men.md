Many high-school students apply to join the group. When the Japanese army lands at Chumpon in December, they bravely fight against the army.  The film is based on the true story of how young army volunteers fought to defend their country from the Japanese Army. A misunderstanding between the two nations caused the unnecessary war to break out. This is an outstanding film depicting patriotism through innocent hearts of boys.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3ug01k1BfjjSyD0BwvKl3D1axPP.jpg", "actors": ["Taya Rogers ()", "Kajonsak Ratananisai ()", "Ron Bunchongsang ()", "\u0e23\u0e38\u0e48\u0e07\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07 \u0e2d\u0e19\u0e31\u0e19\u0e15\u0e22\u0e30 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
