The final 20 years of Komitas life were spent in various mental hospitals. The destiny of Komitas? This is the magic beauty of Armenian culture and the abhorrent brutality of Armenian history. A cultural and artistic world that was slaughtered with a curved knife. A humanity that doggedly advances towards an apocalyptic catastrophe, that does not recognize its own original purpose, eradicates its own memory, its final roots.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dO2Sv3Ceb8IwLEiL9yTALOqGldS.jpg", "actors": ["Samvel Ovasapian (Komitas)", "Margarita Woskanjan (Pupil)", "Omig Saadetian (Terlemesian)", "Yeghishe Mougikian (Katholikos)", "Kegham Khatcherian (Armenian Monk)", "Sybille Vogelsang (Nurse)", "Kameh Jaryani (Angel 1)", "Mohammad Tohmasebi (Musician 1)", "Eksander Abadii (Musician 2)", "Sonja Askarian (Angel 2)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
