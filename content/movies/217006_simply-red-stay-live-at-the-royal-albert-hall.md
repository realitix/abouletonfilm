These sold-out dates served to showcase their new album 'Stay' alongside well loved classics from their incredible back catalogue of hits.  'Stay - Live at the Royal Albert Hall' captures the excitement of an evening with Simply Red at one of the world's premier venues but also offers an intimate glimpse of the life backstage from one of Britain's most successful bands ever.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/12qGckSUjynEPIAa16E0BdYGoS1.jpg", "actors": ["Mick Hucknall (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
