Directed by Ti, The Young Rebel is one such film. Fatherless as a child, Hsiang (Chiang) supports his mother. When gangsters kill his mother, he kills in revenge. Unlike his swordplay heroes, Hsiang admits guilt, expresses sorrow and is imprisoned", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fbRaDkhwcR9KO3Pp8rlgwaiR6Jw.jpg", "actors": ["David Chiang (Xiang Rong)", "Ti Lung (Gen Lai)", "Sammo Hung (Gambling stall thug [extra])", "Yuen Siu-Tin (Rong's sifu)", "Eddy Ko (King Ren)", "Lo Dik (Mr. Tou Cheng)", "Lee Hoi-Sang (Master Liu)", "Chiang Tao (Shi Tou/Stone)", "Fung Ngai (Long Feng)", "Lin Jing (Rong's mother)", "Chiang Nan (Mr. Fong)", "Wan Man (Lin Xiu Ping)", "Ming Ming (Xiang Xiao Zhen)", "Tino Wong Cheung (Snatch thief)", "Cheung Chok-Chow (Bar patron)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
