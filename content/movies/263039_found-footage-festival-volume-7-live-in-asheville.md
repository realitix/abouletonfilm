But Volume 7 is also jam packed with newly unearthed treasures, featuring singing rabbis, petulant news anchors, coughing snake handlers, bodybuilding clowns, and two body parts never before seen in the festival! It's a celebration of a decade of Found. Record over and you'll die! Taped live at The Grey Eagle in Asheville, North Carolina.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rhJ3DGMTI31m0hiqaIvB1VEUD2t.jpg", "actors": ["Joe Pickett (Himself)", "Nick Prueher (Himself, Chef Keith)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
