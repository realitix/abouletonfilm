She sprang to national prominence in 1993 when she joined the cast of ABC TV's The Late Show, her television appearances since then have been many and varied, but ABC TV's 2011 season of Judith Lucy's Spiritual Journey represents her first solo TV project.  A best-selling author, her work in radio, television and film, and her sell-out national live tours have made her a household name.  In this episode of Warehouse Comedy Festival she will perform her recent smash hit show, Nothing Fancy. This is Judith at the top of her game - no singing, no dancing, just good old-fashioned gags.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1Lgtz84zA8POxeDqYv084LJEWka.jpg", "actors": ["Judith Lucy (herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "CkUX6LKKR5A"}
