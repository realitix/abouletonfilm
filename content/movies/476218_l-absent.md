His grim journey takes him to such places as Budapest, Warsaw and Prague. He even visits Tokyo. The major scenes consist of interiors inter-spliced with black-and-white footage of other European locals and old family photographs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oi9dRjENieuMJ3RJMjm9IdtHfdL.jpg", "actors": ["Roland Br\u00e9ard ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
