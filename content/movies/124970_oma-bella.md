Having survived the Holocaust and then stayed in Germany after the war, it is the food they cook together that they remember their childhoods, maintain a bond to each other and answer questions of heritage, memory and identity. As the film follows them through their daily lives, a portrait emerges of two women with a light sense of humor, vivid stories, and a deep fondness for good food. Created by Oma's granddaughter Alexa, the film captures their ongoing struggle to retain a part of their past while remaining very much engaged in the present.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aKcB73FoW012r80PBYxX74vvdD2.jpg", "actors": ["Regina Karolinski (Oma)", "Bella Katz (Bella)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "mEA6dul2rAc"}
