When the attendant leaves the room the skeleton begins kicking his legs and throwing his arms about and suddenly turns into a magician. The magician produces an egg, performing several sleight-of-hand tricks, and places it upon the table with the small end downward. He then crudely draws a human face upon the shell, and the egg immediately begins growing larger and larger until it reaches the size of a normal head.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pRou9BL5DsJgzE25Qtpg6WYGLP7.jpg", "actors": ["Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [195952, 108297, 108273, 108269], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
