Paramu, meanwhile, continues to work as the henchman for another businessman McPherson, who asks him to hide Rs. 1 crore (10 million) of unaccounted money for a period of two months. Paramu entrusts the money to Johnie, but the two fall out because of Unnithan's daughter for whom Paramu has a soft corner but who is now a prostitute because of Johnie's machinations.
