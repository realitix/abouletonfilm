Panic At The Disco's highly anticipated sophomore album debuted at #2 on the Billboard Top 200 chart back in March and things have shown no sign of slowing down for the band. 'Nine In The Afternoon' and 'That Green Gentleman (Things Have Changed)' proved to be follow-up hits to the band's platinum-selling debut despite being a departure from their previous sound. Filmed at the Chicago stop on the Honda Civic tour, this live cd/dvd set showcases live versions of all the hits from both of the band's albums and is a must-have for any diehard Panic fan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dnxUQzZKTqeF4ydwg1AcNHOGHMr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
