She is an artist, but she makes a living working as a babysitter. She is an activist and her boyfriend is a political prisoner. She feels lonely and is struggling to find her place in the world. We follow her as she meets the most important people in her life. Through these meetings, we understand better not only Electra, but also a whole generation of young people who feel stifled in this world. Capitalism, consumerism, globalization are currently being cast into doubt, so I needed to make a film that addresses all these things. What I\u2019m interested in is showing how they affect our everyday life, our small decisions, our intimate relationships.\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/avL3ehh5AkIjPDlMNg581zcMKdL.jpg", "actors": ["Maria Georgiadou (Ilektra)", "Dimitris Xanthopoulos (Manousos)", "Dimitris Piatas (Father)", "Kostas Ganotis (Argyris)", "Alexis Harisis (Petros)", "Themis Bazaka (Mother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "F5VoNV0JkXY"}
