The ladies move in bag and baggage into a sleepy suburban community. Before long, every husband in the vicinity has fallen for their charms. A few trousers have fallen as well, which is why the film carries an R rating. The Girls Next Door is worth watching for an early performance by TV favorite Perry Lang.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ixzZoWUbp199sTnBKjLW6VQbUhX.jpg", "actors": ["Kirsten Baker (Carol Hill)", "Perry Lang (Terry Davis)", "Leslie Cederquist (Neeley Carter)", "Rick Singer (Hotrod)", "Lee Ann Barnes (De De)", "Robert Gribbin (Officer Drury)", "Michael Heit (Officer Turner)", "Dalene Young (Mother)", "Stan Kamber (Father)", "Michael Allyn (Ted)", "Michael Sloane (Dustin)", "George Buck Flower (Mr. Sykes)", "Irene Lawrence (Dustin's Mother)", "Ernee Simpson (Lena)", "Liza Stanley (Bambi)", "Jewel Shepard (Girl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
