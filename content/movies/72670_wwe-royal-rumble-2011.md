It took place on January 30, 2011 at the TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. As has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a match at that year's WrestleMania for his choice at either the WWE Championship or the World Heavyweight Championship.  The main event was the annual Royal Rumble match featuring 40 participants from both brands, instead of the usual number of 30. The primary match on the Raw brand was for the WWE Championship, between reigning champion The Miz and Randy Orton. The primary match on the SmackDown brand was Edge versus Dolph Ziggler for the World Heavyweight Championship. The other featured match on the card was a Fatal Four Way match for the WWE Divas Championship between Eve Torres, Natalya, Layla and Michelle McCool.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kHX9kCuKXgEdgHsnETfsUpp4oFB.jpg", "actors": ["Adam Copeland (Edge)", "Nick Nemeth (Dolph Ziggler)", "Mike Mizanin (The Miz)", "Randy Orton (Himself)", "Kevin Kiley Jr. (Alex Riley)", "Vickie Guerrero (Herself)", "Eve Torres (Herself)", "Natalie Neidhart (Natalya)", "Layla El (Herself)", "Michelle Leigh Calaway  (Herself)", "Phillip Jack Brooks (CM Punk)", "Bryan Danielson (Daniel Bryan)", "Paul Lloyd Jr. (Justin Gabriel)", "Matthew Cardona (Zack Ryder)", "Darren Matthews (William Regal)", "Ted DiBiase, Jr. (Himself)", "John Hennigan (John Morrison)", "Naofumi Yamamoto (Yoshi Tatsu)", "Windham Rotunda (Husky Harris)", "Chavo Guerrero (Himself)", "Mark Henry (Himself)", "Jayson Paul (JTG)", "Joe Hennig (Michael McGillicutty)", "Chris Mordetzky (Chris Masters)", "David Otunga (David Otunga)", "Gabriel Tuft (Tyler Reks)", "Oleg Prudius (Vladimir Kozlov)", "Ron Killings (R-Truth)", "Dalip Singh Rana (The Great Khali)", "Barri Griffiths (Mason Ryan)", "Booker Huffman (Booker T)", "John Cena (Himself)", "Dylan Postl (Hornswoggle)", "T.J.
