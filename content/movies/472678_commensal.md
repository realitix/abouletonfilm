After his release from a mental institution, Sagawa returned to Japan, and later appeared in innumerable documentaries and sexploitation films. In contrast to earlier journalistic documentaries on Sagawa, the film suspends moral judgment and explores a realm that eludes classification as either \u201cdocumentary\u201d or \u201cpure fiction,\u201d to instead chart the ambiguous territory between crime, fantasy, and social realities, between an individual and the economy of his public persona.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Issei Sagawa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
