The lion alternates between finding the food on the cage floor and reaching through the bars to swipe at the man, who stays alarmingly close to the beast. In the background are the large rocks and brick wall at the back of the lion's habitat.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2eZcst2kW8Kp4Z62RJlj4vR3wve.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [163112, 163320, 190695], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
