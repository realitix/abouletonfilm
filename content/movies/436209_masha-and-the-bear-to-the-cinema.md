Precocious, silly, and friendly with everyone she meets, this energetic girl can\u2019t seem to keep herself out of trouble.  Bear is a warm, fatherly figure that does his best to guide his friend and keep her from harm, often ending up the unintended victim of her misadventures. Though he enjoys his quiet time alone, he misses those moments when Masha is not around.  Together with a rag-tag group of friendly animals that have made the forest their home, Masha and the Bear entertains adults and children alike, teaching viewers about creativity, loyalty and true friendship.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8PNIWHBy01TZIVUzqKeGj5RHvnv.jpg", "actors": ["Boris Kutnevich (Medved)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "IzLQ3lW5soI"}
