He had to defend his dignity against insults and village gossip. It took little to stoke the fire once lit, and no one was immune. One of the worst humiliations a man can suffer was to have an adulterous wife. A man so disgraced would bear the mark of shame, with all eyes of the community upon him. It was said that \"his horns were sticking out\" for all to see.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q8wn5D5fvAT76TCqCpgZ8ltV0dk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
