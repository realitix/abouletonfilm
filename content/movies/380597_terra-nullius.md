The film examines how unacknowledged shame and fear passes from one generation to the next, from one culture to another. The last scene depicts a silent meeting between the young Alice and the adult Alice. In order to reclaim her life, Alice decides she must confront the pain and confusion of her childhood.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7ICh3Ty14qA0vuXLS6PFtciWq3V.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
