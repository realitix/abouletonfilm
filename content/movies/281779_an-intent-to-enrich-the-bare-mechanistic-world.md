He is an original thinker, connecting mathematics with philosophy. He has become recognized by public because of invention of the biggest number (the so-called Vop\u011bnka's cardinal) and thanks to being active in politics for two years - he was the first Minister of Education after 1989 revolution in Czechoslovakia. His portrait works mostly with non-synchron images trying to find the abstract qualities in the pieces of prof. Vop\u011bnka's everyday reality, that should inspire the spectator for concentrated interpretation of the words that are mapping personality of Vop\u011bnka - mathematician.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xNQ2AtzEsv87I6yI2nVAStuZhV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
