The Color of Destiny\" is a revealing portrayal of a forgotten icon of French Surrealism: Spanish painter \u00d3scar Dom\u00ednguez, contemporary of Picasso. The film rediscovers the life of a talented artist who was ignored after he committed suicide, fifty years ago, victim of a serious illness which had disfigured his body: the Elephant Man's disease. The film is stirring and touching and compels admiration for the bohemian painter whose fate was self-destruction, after a wild crazy life. Lucas Fern\u00e1ndez turns the life of a debauchee, who regarded himself a monster because of his disfiguring disease, into a universal story where art is the product of love and loneliness, of sex and violence before, during and after the Nazi invasion of Paris.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qIjRyDQWzkQF10k98VpHUIhKjF.jpg", "actors": ["Emma Su\u00e1rez ()", "Victoria Abril ()", "Joaquim de Almeida ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
