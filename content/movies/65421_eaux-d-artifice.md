Heavy red filters give a blue cast to the light; water plays across stone, and fountains send it into the air. No words are spoken. Baroque statuary and the sensuous flow of water are back lit. Anger calls it water games.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cFpwhXz7q4zAj57iMtGxqSZQoaA.jpg", "actors": ["Carmilla Salvatorelli (Lady)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [46784, 125602, 46780, 94512], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
