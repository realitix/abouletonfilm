Chris Sarandon plays BEN KLINE, an American television star and a \u201cbankable name\u201d who is cast to portray the Hungarian writer Miklos Radnoti, whose journal of poems was found with his body, buried in one of Hungary\u2019s mass graves. Kline is also the son of a Holocaust survivor and has long resented his father\u2019s refusal to speak about the War. Now given the opportunity to play the role of a hero, but faced with the reality of a victim, the boundaries between truth and illusion begin to blur. Kline\u2019s idea of resistance begins to clash with his director (John Seitz), who rejects his impulses to fight back as unrealistic. How will Kline fulfill his role as Radnoti, and what kind of legacy will he leave in the minds of the audience, who may come to know the Holocaust only by what they see in the movies?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jDOmT3hKC4U7fqOSYHJ7iD2Rxr.jpg", "actors": ["Chris Sarandon (Ben Kline / Miklos Radnoti)", "Ren\u00e9e Soutendijk (Myra)", "Josef Sommer (Father)", "John Seitz (Hardy)", "Bill Raymond (Gyorgy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
