The NFU-produced dramatisation is didactic but largely sensitive in making Aroha's story represent contemporary M\u0101ori dilemmas (noted anthropologist Ernest Beaglehole was the cultural advisor). Watch out for some musical treats, including an instrumental version of classic Kiwi song, 'Blue Smoke' and a performance of the action song 'Me He Manu Rere'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kp7nNDc8dir9LBc9eXXlyo5tXJP.jpg", "actors": ["Moana Kahui (Aroha)", "Te Wairangi Korowhiti (Aunt Ripeka)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
