The charges, when collated and then heard in court 50 years ago, told the story of the Jewish Holocaust to the entire world in a way that it had not been told before. This changed the collective Israeli consciousness forever. Bureau 06 tells the personal stories of this team of investigators; their hardships, their confessions and the emotional turmoil they experienced, together and alone. Among these is the story of Avner Less, Adolf Eichmann\u2019s interrogator who left Israel after the trial and took back his German identity card.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
