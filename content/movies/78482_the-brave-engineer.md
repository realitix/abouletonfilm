He sets off but is set back by a number of unfortunate circumstances such as a rain storm, a cow on the tracks, a mad bomber, and finally, when his train starts falling apart. Worst of all, he is on a collision course with another train coming in the opposite direction. After a terrific crash, the man at the train station assumes the worst when Casey doesn't show up but, to his delight, Casey finally makes it to his destination a total wreck but on time (almost).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/HpWLC7w7yFoZCYNZYU9fdCw7N5.jpg", "actors": ["Jerry Colonna (Narrator)", "Ken Darby (Himself)", "Jon Dodson (Himself)", "Bud Linn (Himself)", "Rad Robinson (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [44293, 57220, 54200, 54479], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
