Not far away, a woman smashes her car into a tree, only to discover her leg is a shredded bloody stump. Hot on her heels is a faceless ghoul hell-bent on burying his axe in her skull. A tussle ensues during which bullets are fired and limbs are lopped off. Meanwhile, the young couple gets dressed and wipes the fog from their windows; only then do they become aware of the gory melee that occurred not ten paces from their vehicle.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zlkKizt0tA0yosZpEq9qW0f2qVj.jpg", "actors": ["Minh-Khai Phan-Thi (Sarah)", "Florian Wagner (Marc)", "Michou Pascale Anderson (Verletzte Frau)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
