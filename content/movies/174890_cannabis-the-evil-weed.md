Can cannabis cause schizophrenia? Is it addictive? Can it lead you on to harder drugs? Or is it simply a herb, an undervalued medicine?  Addiction specialist Dr John Marsden discovers that modern science is finally beginning to find answers to these questions. John traces the cannabis plants' birthplace in Kazakhstan; finds the origins of our sensitivity to cannabis in the simple sea squirt; and shows just what it does to our brains.  He meets people who have been changed by this drug in drastically different ways - from those whose lives have been shattered to those who lives have been revived.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m1vzX6Bt3FoZzV8KRGyDSw2pF4k.jpg", "actors": ["John Marsden (Himself - Presenter (as Dr John Marsden))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
