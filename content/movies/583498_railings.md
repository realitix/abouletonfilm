The images that you see are simultaneously scanned by the optical sound reader in the projector, which converts the into sound.  This particular film makes use of the aural effect of visual perspective; the steeper the perspective on the railings, the closer the intervals of black and white, and the higher the frequency of sound. I also wanted to find out what freeze frames and visual strobe would 'sound' like. Visual strobe is created both in the camera (camera shutter v. railings) and in the printer (printer shutter v. slipping frames).\" -G.S.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p6GEYOyFkh3K74gSCXNDnqvwry1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
