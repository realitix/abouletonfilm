The Fearless Freaks documents their rise from Butthole Surfers-imitating noisemakers to grand poobahs of orchestral pop masterpieces. Filmmaker Bradley Beesely had the good fortune of living in the same neighborhood as lead Lip Wayne Coyne, who quickly enlisted his buddy to document his band's many concerts and assorted exploits. The early footage is a riot, with tragic hair styles on proud display as the boys attempt to cover up their lack of natural talent with sheer volume. During one show, they even have a friend bring a motorcycle on stage, which is then miked for sound and revved throughout the performance, clearing the club with toxic levels of carbon monoxide. Great punk rock stuff. Interspersed among the live bits are interviews with the band's family and friends, revealing the often tragic circumstances of their childhoods and early career.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dupLHfDSFy1dsI26bWAuqd3BmVc.jpg", "actors": ["Beck (Himself)", "Bradley Beesley (Narrator)", "Steve Burns (Himself)", "Dolly Coyne (Herself)", "Kenny Coyne (Himself)", "Marty Coyne (Himself)", "Tommy Coyne (Himself)", "Wayne Coyne (Himself)", "Jonathan Donahue (Himself)", "James Drozd (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [54989, 48918, 49427, 59995], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
