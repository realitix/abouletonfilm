He is given a cruise ticket by an aristocrat who is an old school friend, and is mistaken for the aristocrat when he uses a camera that has his friends name on it. Assia Noris plays a maid who falls in love with him because of who he is and not who others think he is. Happy ending comes when De Sica marries Noris, who is more real than the pampered society belles he has been partying with.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/IEXadBWpPR8SCDBjo1R8A8EIsx.jpg", "actors": ["Vittorio De Sica (Gianni / Max Varaldo)", "Assia Noris (Lauretta)", "Rubi D'Alma (Donna Paola (as Rubi Dalma))", "Lilia Dale (Pucci (as Adonella))", "Caterina Collo (Zia Lucia)", "Umberto Melnati (Riccardo)", "Mario Casaleggio (Zio Pietro)", "Virgilio Riento (Pepe (as Riento))", "Vivi Gioi (Dolly (as Vivien Diesca))", "Michele Contessa ((uncredited))", "Romolo Costa (Il commandante Baldi (uncredited))", "Luciano Dorcoratto (Guido (uncredited))", "Ernesto Ghigi (Pierino (uncredited))", "Desiderio Nobile (Il maggiore (uncredited))", "Clara Padoa (Jeanne - la giocatrice al bridge sul treno (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [290633], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
