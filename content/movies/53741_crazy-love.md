Harry Voss, 12, is young and naive. Love, for him, is romantic love between princes and princesses demurely kissing each other on the mouth. His father is a hero who kidnapped his mother and married her on a lonely mountain peak... Later on, he'll do the same. But Harry has a lot to learn. He learns about 'being hot' and 'fucking' and about what you have to do when you're alone and 'feel the itch'. He also learns that there are handsome men and ugly ones, that love can be unfair. That one can find comfort in drinking... but above all he learns that man is capable of anything - absolutely anything! - to get his fair share of love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fFbMigzesJSvNP9B6pXLcHDV1SW.jpg", "actors": ["Geert Hunaerts (Jonge Harry Voss)", "Josse De Pauw (Harry Voss/Vader Harry Voss eerste deel)", "Michael Pas (Stan)", "G\u00e8ne Bervoets (Jeff)", "Amid Chakir (Bill)", "Florence B\u00e9liard (The Princess / The corpse)", "Karen van Parijs (Moeder van Harry)", "Carmela Locantore (Gina)", "An van Essche (Liza Velani)", "Doriane Moretus (Marina)", "Fran\u00e7ois Beukelaers (The doctor)", "Erik Burke (A student)", "Kathleen Seret (Cathy)", "Claude Koener (Gina's lover)", "Alexandre von Sivers (The monk)", "Jan Weuts (A policeman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [48346, 134193, 335202, 21644], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
