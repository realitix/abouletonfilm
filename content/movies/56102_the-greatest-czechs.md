Starving artists who already have a number of films to their names, Czech Lion award-winning films, excellent reviews and have been screened at numerous festivals, but they don't have audiences. Their next collaborative effort - the Director's lifetime dream - is quickly becoming oblivion because he failed to win a grant, which means it won't be made. And so the frustrated Director and his colleagues await their chance among record-holders of curious disciplines such as crawling with a squash racket or collecting four-leaf clovers. How will the collision of these two worlds end? What will the Director's next film be about?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bqOE5sHpOJqNf7xqB1QvZlONOIF.jpg", "actors": ["Jaroslav Plesl (re\u017eis\u00e9r)", "Simona Bab\u010d\u00e1kov\u00e1 (producentka)", "Ji\u0159\u00ed Vyor\u00e1lek (kameraman)", "Jana Jan\u011bkov\u00e1 (vaza\u010dova \u017eena)", "Igor Chmela (vaza\u010d sl\u00e1my)", "Marek Tacl\u00edk (rekordman v pit\u00ed piva pod vodou)", "\u017delezn\u00fd Zekon (himself)", "Johana \u0160varcov\u00e1 (zvuka\u0159ka)", "Robert Miklu\u0161 (rekordman v poj\u00edd\u00e1n\u00ed p\u00e1rk\u016f)", "Martin My\u0161i\u010dka (sb\u011bratel \u010dty\u0159l\u00edstk\u016f)", "Petr Fiedor (himself)", "Igor Bare\u0161 (\u0161\u00e9f Agentury Dobr\u00fd den)", "Anna Geislerov\u00e1 (\u010d\u00ed\u0161nice)", "Jan H\u0159ebejk (p\u0159edseda grantov\u00e9 komise)", "David \u0160vehl\u00edk (rekordman v pot\u00e1p\u011bn\u00ed bez p\u0159\u00edstroje)", "Jan J.
