Social dissolution permeates WHEEL OF ASHES, a stripped-down account of a young man's existential reckoning. \"As dust hides a mirror, lust hides the self,\" reads one of the film's Vedanta-sourced intertitles. And indeed, while the Pierre Clementi protagonist's inner life remains obscure, the Saint-Germain-des-Pres neighborhood that offers his temptations appears in harrowing detail. In its nearly clinical treatment of spiritual withdrawal, WHEEL OF ASHES belongs with post-New Wave films by the likes of Jean Eustache and Philippe Garrel. - Max Goldberg", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o7Rl6oTePeefZWOEkI6fBkWgkgr.jpg", "actors": ["Pierre Cl\u00e9menti (Pierre)", "Katinka Bo (Anka)", "Pierre Basan\u00e7on (David)", "Judith Malina ()", "Juliet Berto ()", "Stasia Gelber ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "AzjuzYFDnFQ"}
