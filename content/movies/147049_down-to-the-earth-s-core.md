Using spectacular computer generated imagery; the camera smashes through almost 9 000 kilometres of solid rock to explore the hidden world beneath our feet. Experience an earthquake inside the San Andreas Fault, blast out of a volcano, encounter bizarre cave-dwelling creatures and enter caves full of giant crystals \u2013 all inside planet Earth. As the camera lowers into Earth's bosom, the planet\u2019s extraordinary story, is laid bare layer by layer, showing how prehistoric forests became modern-day fuel, witnessing the dinosaur\u2019s cataclysmic death, and watching as stalactites form and gold grows before our eyes. Deeper, beyond the reach of any mine, any drill, we find wonders beyond imagination: towering molten metal tornadoes, forests of solid iron crystals, until we reach the strangest, least understood place on the planet \u2013 the core.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qL6V6swaf0l5749aFkra4zr51vS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
