Embracing low budget Hi 8 video to conduct informal street interviews and investigate the origin of the name of Blissville, and the character(s) of the town, the video takes the experimental form of a docu/poem. Not in the traditional sense with words but as a lyrical visual odyssey.  The video is not so much a mourning of things past, nor a nostalgia, although both these elements are present. It is more about the quest for, and resilience of community.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "l28RJgcIMww"}
