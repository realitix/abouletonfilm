The bus, however, is old, and needs to be replaced. The bus driver himself is also needed as a handyman for all the people around him, assisting with stray cattle, household machines, children's homework, errands of all kinds, and at one occasion, assisting birth. Progress is however leaving him behind, and the local county council plots on a solution, involving a new bus and driver. The community revolts, and the local midwife (married to the mayor) intervenes with all the locals to keep the bus driver, who ends up keeping his job in a new bus.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vtZbxZC6PM50ia1pT7q50CS9eq9.jpg", "actors": ["Dirch Passer (Buschauff\u00f8r Martin)", "Karl Stegger (Sigurd)", "Paul Hagen (K\u00e6mneren)", "Ove Sprog\u00f8e (Vik)", "Lone Hertz (Helga)", "Axel Str\u00f8bye (Lars)", "Lily Broberg (Emma)", "Gunnar Lemvigh ()", "Ole Monty ()", "Grethe Mogensen ()", "Arthur Jensen ()", "Tove Ma\u00ebs ()", "Vals\u00f8 Holm ()", "Hugo Herrestrup ()", "Aage Winther-J\u00f8rgensen ()", "Albert Watson ()", "Gunnar Str\u00f8mvad ()", "Anne Dencker ()", "Malene Schwartz (Else)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [33447, 46699, 33947, 54593], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
