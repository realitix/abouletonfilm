Deeply distressed, they go to a Christmas fair and buy a lottery ticket with their remaining money. To their delight, they win a washing machine! Peter is especially excited when Santa Claus shows up and promises to transport the machine for him, but the old man instead vanishes with the boys' gift. Hans is convinced that Peter has been conned and chases after the fleeing Santa. But Peter simply cannot believe that Santa Claus could be anything other than kind and helpful.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ujpUzcQDFA624iiyRUiLeZQ04Ku.jpg", "actors": ["Karsten Lekve (Peter)", "Ronald Jacob (Hans)", "Steffi Sluka (Tina)", "Rolf Herricht (Weihnachtsmann Willi)", "Fred Delmare (Taxifahrer Klaus)", "G\u00fcnter Schubert (Beppo)", "Jir\u00ed Vrst\u00e1la (Clown Ferdinand)", "Werner Pfeifer (Felino)", "Dieter Wien ()", "Ernst-Georg Schwill ()", "Horst Papke ()", "Theresia Wider ()", "Gerhard Vogt ()", "Edgar K\u00fclow ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
