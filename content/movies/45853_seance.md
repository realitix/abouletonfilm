Lauren's been seeing things in her bathroom: a silent child of about six. Diego has written a paper on parapsychology, so he holds a s\u00e9ance with the disbelieving co-eds. Something goes awry, because bad things start to happen and the students' only defender is an aging campus cop named Syd. What's the silent ghostly girl's secret, and can Alison discover what's going on before it's too late?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gQURrMMCNRAayXAJs4AlmVZ1Z8L.jpg", "actors": ["Adrian Paul (Spence)", "Kandis Erickson (Lauren)", "Bridget Shergalis (Cara Furia)", "Tori White (Melina)", "Chauntal Lewis (Alison)", "Jack Hunter (Syd)", "Joel Geist (Grant)", "A.J.
