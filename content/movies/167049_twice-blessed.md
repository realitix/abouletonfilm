Each envies the lifestyle of the other; and they decide, without telling Jeff or Mary, to switch families for a day or two. They soon find that it is harder to do what the other person is expected to do, and that looking alike is not enough. When they find that their charade may bring their parents back together, they agree to continue it. A major complication begins when Alice, Jeff's girlfriend and co-worker, finds out the real story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nDXcUtSkyFcrv4RCfiSimPDfsdg.jpg", "actors": ["Preston Foster (Jeff Turner)", "Gail Patrick (Mary Hale)", "Lee Wilde (Terry Turner)", "Lyn Wilde (Stephanie Hale)", "Richard Gaines (Senator John Pringle)", "Jean Porter (Kitty)", "Marshall Thompson (Jimmy)", "Jimmy Lydon (Mickey Pringle)", "Gloria Hope (Alice 'Dutchess' Hunter)", "Ethel Smith (Ethel Smith - Organist)", "Douglas Cowan (Jake)", "Warren Mills (Whitey)", "Joel Friedkin (Mr. Winters)", "Ralph Brooke (Chet)", "Ralph Hoopes (Lionel)", "Don Hayden (Alfi)", "Tommy Bond (Horace)", "John Dehner (Contest Announcer (uncredited))", "Bess Flowers (Banquet Guest (uncredited))", "Edward Gargan (Outraged Baseball Fan (uncredited))", "Eddie Hall (Photographer at Airport (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
