He was orphaned as a little boy and has since been brought up by a couple belonging to the lower caste. A trip to the 'agraharam' brings back memories of his childhood and he realises that he is in fact a Brahmin and the son of the head priest at the temple. Wishing to help his real family while at the same time unable to forget the parents who adopted him, he shuffles between the two vastly different worlds. Maheswar, a lower caste woman, waits for him back home while Gayatri falls in love with him in his new life.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Sathyaraj (Sivaraman)", "Suvalakshmi (Maheswari)", "Divyaa Unni (Gayathri)", "Ranjith ()", "Manivannan ()", "Thalaivasal Vijay ()", "Vagai Chandrasekar ()", "Nizhalgal Ravi ()", "Raj Kapoor ()", "Junior Balaiya ()", "Periya Karuppu Thevar ()", "Mayilsamy ()", "Kalairani ()", "Shanthi Williams ()", "Kamala Kamesh ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
