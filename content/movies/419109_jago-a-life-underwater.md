{"tmdb_id": 419109, "title": "Jago: A Life Underwater", "original_title": "Jago: A Life Underwater", "slug_title": "jago-a-life-underwater", "date": "2015-09-24", "genre": ["Documentaire"], "score": "6.2/10", "synopsis": "Jago tells the story of an 80 year old sea nomad called Rohani who has spent his life plying the waters of South East Asia\u2019s Coral Triangle. The story is told entirely from Rohani\u2019s perspective, against the spectacular backdrop of the Togian Islands, and recreates events that capture the turning points in his life, as a hunter and as a man. We were able to bring Rohani\u2019s past experiences to life by working closely with his family and friends in the village where he grew up. These are the people you see representing Rohani in the film at various stages in his life. Story telling is a big part of Bajau culture, and a way of preserving traditions through generations, so everyone was very enthusiastic about what we were trying to do and brought lots of ideas of their own, especially Rohani. Although he had never had a camera pointed at him, it certainly wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d sat around telling stories. We were just lucky that he let us capture it on film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7vQC1UJ2FIa4vAOf7nYlcR9SPYr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [520777, 339994], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
