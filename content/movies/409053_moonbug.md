A journey in which he was to meet the adventurers, risk takers and dreamers who were behind one of the most historic endeavors of our time. From living rooms and moonscape deserts, to Cape Canaveral, Steve captures these pioneers in frank, revealing portraits, while unravelling their very personal and divergent memories. With rare archive footage and an original score by Matt Johnson and The The, Moonbug is both a photographic road trip and an exploration of how photographs become signpost for history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hnTFGnAxVk0nsIN0P7BlHROU30F.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
