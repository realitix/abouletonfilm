In these talks, Harris discussed a range of experiences that have traditionally been considered \u201cspiritual\u201d\u2014in particular the phenomenon of self-transcendence. Although such experiences tell us nothing about the origins of the cosmos, they confirm some well-established truths about the human mind: Our conventional sense of self is an illusion; positive emotions, such as compassion and serenity, are teachable skills; and the way we think can profoundly influence our lives and the lives of others.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i3rtDGSShztwAjd3cSmGQAgQ4M.jpg", "actors": ["Sam Harris (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
