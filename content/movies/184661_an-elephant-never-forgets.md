The teacher leaves the room, putting a turtle in charge. While she's gone, things go fine for a while, but the ape starts an all-out book tossing brawl. As the teacher returns, everyone suddenly stops, and although the room is a shambles, she congratulates them on behaving and dismisses them for the day.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lVgVi86TBvYQ6R80wZQkPqmUSGt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
