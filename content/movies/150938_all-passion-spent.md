Tended by her equally aged French maid Genoux (Eileen Way), who has served her faithfully for a lifetime, Lady Slane deals with a succession of advice from her large flock of middle-aged children. The family is chagrined by, but honors, her choice to live a modest country retirement at some distance, in Hampstead Heath. Lady Slane competently comes to terms to lease and restore a crumbling house, aided by an aging land agent Gervase Bucktrout (Maurice Denham). Once settled, an acquaintance from 50 years past, Mr. Fitzgeorge (Harry Andrews), visits the cottage to rekindle memories of their brief, deep, but unfulfilled brush as soul-mates in colonial India when Lady Slane was a devoted young wife and mother. Great-granddaughter Deborah (Jane Snowden), who has been trapped by a socially desirable but passionless engagement, regularly visits to confide and seek wisdom.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vFkOho8tzS90xEV3ObfRSmujFXN.jpg", "actors": ["Harry Andrews (Mr. Fitzgeorge)", "Geoffrey Bayldon (William)", "Faith Brook (Lavinia)", "Patrick Barlow (Foljam - Assistant curator)", "Phyllis Calvert (Carrie)", "Graham Crowden (Herbert)", "Maurice Denham (Gervase Bucktrout)", "John Franklyn-Robbins (Kay)", "Wendy Hiller (Lady Slane)", "Hilary Mason (Edith)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
