The human scarecrow is a rare profession found in the rice fields of the Mexican state of Morelos.  With playful puns, a war cry and the crack of a whip to keep the crows at bay, they transport us into an archaic and almost surreal world as they fight against birds, nature and the progress that threatens their very existence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s6i811unWbJ8XU8qbAvYMPN2b02.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "E2L0mrZyC-E"}
