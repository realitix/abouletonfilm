He vies with the school\u2019s reigning bully, who takes a romantic interest in his older stepsister. When they learn she\u2019s going to be sold to a brothel to pay off her father\u2019s debts, they form an uneasy alliance to free her. With surprising moments of caricature and slapstick, Obayashi celebrates the anarchic world of adolescence while also satirizing adult hypocrisy and conformism.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tssDuloGWV6uQ85mwSac41extx6.jpg", "actors": ["Saburoh Bouya (Bonchan's Father)", "Sen Hara (Old Woman with Urn)", "Yasufumi Hayashi (Soutaroh Sudou)", "Wakaba Irie (Soutaroh's Mother)", "Guts Ishimatsu (Gunroh Tabata)", "Shigeru Izumiya (Old Fisherman)", "Jun'ichir\u00f4 Katagiri (Sakae Ohsugi)", "Nenji Kobayashi (Gonzoh)", "Nenji Kobayashi (Sakae's Father)", "Tomokazu Miura (Soutaroh's Father)", "Toshie Negishi (Sakae's Mother)", "Koichi Sato (Chuui Aoki)", "Makoto Sat\u014d (Seiroku the Pimp)", "J\u00f4 Shishido (School Principal)", "Aiko Shouriki (Mizue Okami)", "Riki Takeuchi (Kawakita-sensei)", "Kumeko Uchibe (Old Woman at Stone Image)", "Isako Washio (O-Shouchan)", "Akira \u00d4izumi (School Custodian)", "Toshinori Omi (Yuuta Hayami)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
