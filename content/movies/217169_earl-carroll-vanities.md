{"tmdb_id": 217169, "title": "Earl Carroll Vanities", "original_title": "Earl Carroll Vanities", "slug_title": "earl-carroll-vanities", "date": "1945-04-05", "genre": ["Romance / Musique"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "Broadway producer Earl Carroll was a Ziegfeld-like entrepreneur who staged lavish revues featuring attractive young ladies. Carroll's annual \"Vanities\" provided story material for three Hollywood films: Murder at the Vanities (34), A Night at Earl Carroll's (40) and Earl Carroll Vanities (45). This last film was produced by Republic Pictures, a bread-and-butter studio specializing in Westerns and serials; Republic had made musicals before, but few of them were expensive enough to allow for lavish production numbers. Earl Carroll Vanities is likewise rather threadbare, though some of the individual musical highlights aren't bad. The plot, such as it is, concerns financially strapped nightclub owner Eve Arden, who finagles Earl Carroll into staging one of his revues at her club.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sbpyO37m5CofbYKKLlZwdybpgJP.jpg", "actors": ["Dennis O'Keefe (Danny Baldwin)", "Constance Moore (Drina)", "Eve Arden (Tex Donnelly)", "Otto Kruger (Earl Carroll)", "Alan Mowbray (Grand Duke Paul)", "Stephanie Bachelor (Claire Elliott)", "Pinky Lee (Pinky Price)", "Mary Forbes (Queen Mother Elena)", "Harry Parke (Walter)", "Leon Belasco (Baron Dashek)", "Tom Dugan (Waiter in Tex's Club)", "Chester Clute (Mr. Weems)", "Tom London (Tom the Doorman)", "Beverly Lloyd (Cigarette Girl)", "Edward Gargan (Policeman)", "Robert Greig (Vonce the Butler)", "Wilton Graff (Mr. Thayer)", "Tommy Ivo (Tommy)", "Melva Anstead (Dancer)", "Bobby Barber (Cab Driver)", "Joy Barlow (Dancer)", "Joan Blair (Mrs. Weems)", "Joan Byron (Dancer)", "Martha Carroll (Dancer)", "Charles Coleman (2nd Butler)", "Margia Dean (Chorine)", "Charles Dorety (Waiter)", "Bobbie Dorree (Dancer)", "Geraldine Farnum (Dancer)", "Frances Gladwin (Dancer)", "Harriette Haddon (Dancer)", "Rosemonde James (Dancer)", "Jimmy Kelly (Fat Man)", "Donald Kerr (Assistant Dance Director)", "Marian Kerrigan (Dancer)", "Helen Klinkner (Hat Check Girl)", "Rex Lease (Policeman)", "Ethelreda Leopold (Chorine)", "Guido Lombardo (Bartender)", "Adele Mara (Chorine)", "Marie McCardle (Chorine)", "Rose Marie Morel (Dancer)", "Diana Mumby (Dancer)", "Jack O'Shea (Cab Driver)", "Patti Posten (Dancer)", "Stanley Price (Sandwich Man)", "Arlyn Roberts (Dancer)", "Jane Ross (Dancer)", "Vicki Saunders (Dancer)", "Sarah Selby (Mrs. Thayer)", "Dorothy Stevens (Dancer)", "Charles Sullivan (Mugg)", "Robert J.
