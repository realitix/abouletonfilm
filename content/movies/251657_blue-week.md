After a weekend of dancing and camping on a recreation island near the city, a young factory worker decides to stay and cut work for a day. Walking around the now deserted island, he meets a beautiful woman camping alone and sunbathing in the nude on the beach. A hot romance flares up between the worker and the more upper-class married lady, lasting through the light-filled nights of the whole summer week until the woman's much older husband returns to the island the next weekend.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nSw1YEbEPOTxiMuQyjDRHzDZvE6.jpg", "actors": ["Gunvor Sandkvist (Siiri Forss)", "Matti Oravisto (Usko Siltanen)", "Toivo M\u00e4kel\u00e4 (Bertel Forss)", "Paavo Hukkinen (Usko's 1st pal)", "Kauko Laurikainen (Usko's 2nd pal)", "Juhani Kumpulainen (Agitator)", "Kaarlo Saarnio (Doorkeeper)", "Leo Jokela (Usko's 3rd pal)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
