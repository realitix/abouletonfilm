A sprinkle of hope enters when a escaped zebra runs free in the city. The eight strangers all are subconsciously enticed to catch this zebra. In doing so, their lives intertwine and are profoundly changed. This is a story about liberty, compassion and hope in modern times of troublesome existential thought.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aI9QhIh1xdDN6fr6iSEANklE9SA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
