Having written a thrilling 2002 score accompanying screenings of Vertov's monumental film, as well as the British Film Institute's DVD release, Nyman exploits his considerable acquaintance with the work to create a similarly giddy montage with editor Max Pugh, this time shot on video over the past two decades.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8olugSxAIP7Js6L5hpFlFcOET2G.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Nyman ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
