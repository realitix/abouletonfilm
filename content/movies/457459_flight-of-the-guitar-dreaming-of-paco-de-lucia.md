From Mallorca, Jerez de la Frontera and Lisbon to the United States and Latin America, this musical instrument has been travelling, keeping alive the magic of its master, Paco de Luc\u00eda.  \"La Maestro\" flew from hand to hand; from those of Carlinhos Brown to those of Alejandro Sanz, stopping off at Tomatito\u2019s or those of Mu\u00f1equitos de Matanzas, delivering anecdotes, nostalgia and a lot of art along the way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q8CuxMnLXoeoZfxTQpnyfxZDlvt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "wBY5Jc0ViHE"}
