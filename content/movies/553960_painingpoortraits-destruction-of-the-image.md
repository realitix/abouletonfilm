He is made priest of the Church of Satan by Anton LaVey in 1992. Of Native American origins, he is the leader of the artistic circle of performers called \u201cUnited Satanic Apache Front\u201d. In this movie, he exposes sacrificial acts that are filled with magic, originating from nature and the individuals themselves, as well as from his artistic creations, smashed on the altar of anti-consumerism.
