Director Bill Zebub has trimmed all of the filler from the standard serial killer movie and replaced it with a near constant barrage of depraved sexual horror. \"Most serial killer films favor soap opera dialogue and speculation-depictions of the killer doing anything but the vile deeds for which he became famous. This movie shows ONLY the deranged part of the serial killer's story.\" - Bill Zebub WARNING: This film contains graphic nudity and sexual assault and in intended only for mature audiences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/trqD2pc8F6E7Oosv8CqXDV7BhBP.jpg", "actors": ["Taylor Trash ()", "Eidolona ()", "Kathy Rice ()", "Angelina Martin ()", "Jordana Leigh ()", "Bill Zebub ()", "Kitty Daly ()", "Anton Bernard ()", "Kerri Taylor ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
