He was prepared for another Holocaust. So were other children in Boro Park, the largest Orthodox survivor community in America, and this candid portrait of a young Jewish activist coming to terms with his father's traumatic history is as bracing as any fiction. Through his writing and activism, Yossi attempts to carry on the legacy of struggle passed on to him. A portrait emerges of a young man whose world view and personal outlook have been principally shaped by an event that took place before he was born.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aiWov61OznbCz0nobQ3IpPKTl3f.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
