In a dusty hotel room, a depressed husband (Lloyd Kaufman) reads a \"Dear John\" letter from his long suffering spouse. In another location, an old man (Tyree) tells the tale of his randy rollercoaster existence -- and the hunchback son he fathered. In a trailer across town, a recluse (Vietnam Ron) is loosing his eyesight and reflects on his failed relationship with his blonde bimbo wife (Maryanne Spychalski). Elsewhere, a flamboyant real estate agent entertains clients and friends in a tumble down track house. Together they form the spine of a storyline that shifts between scatological discussions of intestinal gas and equally meaningful mediations on contentment, and the pursuit of friendship.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7ca2Mj6mgtw8e9diOzfQN7oOiEI.jpg", "actors": ["Lloyd Kaufman ()", "Vietnam Ron ()", "Maryanne Spychalski ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
