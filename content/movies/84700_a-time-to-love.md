But the Great Cultural Revolution fathered it. As memorable as Romeo and Juliet, their love tied with the same intrusion from their families \u00a8C the hatred. Until one day, they watched Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. It inspires them. It gives their juiceless love story the hope for fruit. It brings them the determination to bridge through time setting aside the hatred. The same gives them a wait of 12 years. 12 years of changing time, changing era. Friends come and go. Songs sang become old. How much longer for their love can they hold? How much longer for their love with beautiful memory and unforgettable days can they hold?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xhianvbp5QU2GhOM7GkKJfvlWgX.jpg", "actors": ["Zhao Wei (Qu Ran)", "Lu Yi (Hou Jia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
