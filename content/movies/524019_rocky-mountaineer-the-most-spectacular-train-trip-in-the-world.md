A voyage where the passenger becomes a real traveller, steeped not only in the natural, stunning beauty of the surroundings but also in the romance and opulence associated with the golden age of rail. A classic rail adventure experiencing the thrills of crossing the Canadian Rockies. Torrential waterfalls, soaring eagles and the contrast of sapphire blue lakes and snow-capped peaks are spectacular and can all be viewed from either the magnificent bi-level dome car or the observation carriage. The unmatchable comfort and elegance of the Goldleaf service brings to life the era when the railways were the \"only\" way to travel.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/veT0tsFbaBgp5tCeJf6UeX6Rrzh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
