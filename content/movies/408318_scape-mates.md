Working with the \"Scan-i-mate,\" an early analog video synthesizer, Emshwiller choreographs an architectural, illusory video space, in which frames proliferate within frames, disembodied heads and hands move within a collage of animated forms, and the dancers and their environment are subjected to constant transformations through image processing. With its witty interplay of the \"real\" and the \"unreal\" in an electronically rendered videospace, and the skillful manipulation and articulation of a sculptural illusion of three-dimensionality, Scape-mates introduced a new vocabulary of video image-making.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tuKYqHgOXm7R4Mc9zAWMKEcopfg.jpg", "actors": ["Stoney Emshwiller ((voice))", "Emery Hermans (Dancer)", "Sarah Shelton (Dancer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
