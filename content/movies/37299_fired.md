Turning to friends in show business, she was assured she was not alone. Everyone she knew, from her rabbi to her gynaecologist, had their own account of getting the boot. Featuring interviews with comedians, economists and regular working folks, and drawing on her hugely popular book, Fired! is a humorous look at downsizing in America.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oOFdTrCvBqu2voaxedrTcvGNFxY.jpg", "actors": ["Stephen Adly Guirgis (Himself)", "W.
