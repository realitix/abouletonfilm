The next scenes introduce the viewer to his family and their poor financial and social situation. As Braulio stumbles around looking for his glasses, he causes a famous film star, Alfonso de Madrazo (Rafael Alcaide) to crash his car. Braulio offers him to eat at his house as an apology. Braulio's sister and mother, big film fans, immediately recognise Alfonso and attempt to get him to bring the girl, Luisa Pel\u00e1ez (Irma Dolores) to Mexico City to become a film star. Alfonso agrees and tells them to come to the capital.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A18TbTzzD7s9i1ZgoFGPHk0BVB6.jpg", "actors": ["Pedro Infante (Braulio Pel\u00e1ez)", "Guillermina Grin (Elisa Miranda)", "\u00d3scar Pulido (Facundo Pel\u00e1ez)", "Irma Dorantes (Luisa)", "Rafael Alcayde (Alfonso de Madrazo)", "Famie Kaufman (Daniela)", "Florencio Castell\u00f3 (Se\u00f1or Isaac)", "Alejandro Ciangherotti (Director Borcellini)", "Armando Velasco (Adaptador)", "Alfredo Varela (Novio de Luisa)", "Luis Mussot (Se\u00f1or director)", "Ren\u00e9 Cardona Jr. (Estudiante)", "Jaime Calpe (Juanito)", "Germ\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s (Tin Tan)", "Antonio Bad\u00fa (Himself)", "Leticia Palma (Herself)", "Miguel Morayta (Director de pelicula)", "Pedro Vargas (Cantante)", "Julio Ahuet (Borracho en hotel (uncredited))", "V\u00edctor Alcocer (Anunciador del cabaret (uncredited))", "Daniel Arroyo (Cliente en cabaret (uncredited))", "Rub\u00e9n M\u00e1rquez (Cliente en cabaret (uncredited))", "F\u00e9lix Samper (Cliente en cabaret (uncredited))", "Ana Mar\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez (Clienta en cabaret (uncredited))", "\u00c1ngela Rodr\u00edguez (Clienta en cabaret (uncredited))", "Rodolfo Calvo (Productor de pelicula (uncredited))", "Maria Luisa Cort\u00e9s (La manicura (uncredited))", "Pedro Elviro (Goliat (uncredited))", "Jos\u00e9 Escanero (Gerente del hotel (uncredited))", "Mar\u00eda Gentil Arcos (Asistente de Facundo (uncredited))", "Salvador God\u00ednez (Empleado del estudio (uncredited))", "Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz (Vendedor de muebles (uncredited))", "Francisco Pando (Escritor de la  pelicula (uncredited))", "Nicol\u00e1s Rodr\u00edguez hijo (Estudiante (uncredited))", "Hern\u00e1n Vera (Polic\u00eda (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
