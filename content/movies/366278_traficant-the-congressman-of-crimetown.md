He quickly ascended to the hallowed halls of Congress, becoming its most outspoken member. \"Jimbo\" as his die-hard supporters called him, was known for his polyester thrift store suits, shock top wigs, vulgar humor and profanity laced rhetoric against the FBI, IRS, and every president since Reagan.
