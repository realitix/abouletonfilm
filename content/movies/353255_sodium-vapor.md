The title derives from an interest in the particular qualities of sodium vapor street lighting \u2014 its characteristic color temperature, the shadows it casts, and the eerie quality it seems to impart to the objects it illuminates. The essence of the work is the spell which the hour has over the physical spaces of the streets in the early morning. There is always the unseen presence of the large number of people surrounding you, most of them sleeping; the camera is awake in their dreamtime. The recording of these locations in the middle of the night rather than in daylight represents a transformation \u2014 like figure/ground reversal \u2014 of these physical spaces from the familiar thoughts and activities of the day to the nighttime shadows of emptiness and obscurity.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6eWegZaigqnlT5lKuJwUvC6LeNR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
