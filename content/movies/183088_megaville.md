All forms of media are encouraged in Megaville, but this freedom has aided moral decay with the distribution of pornography and violent movies. Outside Megaville lies the Hemisphere; whereas Megaville is clean and ordered, the Hemisphere is in a state of decay. Travel from the Hemisphere to Megaville is restricted with few exceptions to the powerful. An outwardly totalitarian regime governs the daily life of civilians in the Hemisphere and the people live in fear of the \"CKS\" (the secret police). All forms of media are illegal in the Hemisphere.  CC wikipedia.org", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k75xJfQYhF8UNuPmO57EW3xX1Pl.jpg", "actors": ["J. C.
