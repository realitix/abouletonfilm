Bud is reluctant to become her partner, as he has proven to himself to be unreliable in relationships, but he tells her to call him whenever she needs help. While working in a beer garden, Florette meets Hap Stanley, an avaricious performer who marries her to get the rights to perform her show routine. Hap dislikes Jimmy and eventually convinces Florette to send him away to school. Both Jimmy and Florette are broken-up over being apart, but Jimmy pretends it is what he wants so Florette can be happy with Hap.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Lee Tracy (Bud Hannigan)", "Helen Mack (Florette Faxon)", "Helen Morgan (Bonnie Kay)", "David Holt (Jimmy Faxon)", "Arthur Pierson (Hap Stanley)", "Lynne Overman (Brown)", "Dean Jagger (Military School Instructor)", "Ann Sheridan (Wedding Party Guest)", "Edwin Stanley (Major Hurley - School Commandant)", "Irene Ware (Lila Lacey)", "Lou Cass (Joe Mandel)", "Max Mack (Jack Mandel)", "Mary Owen (Maizie Kelly)", "Neal Dodd (Minister at Funeral)", "Irving Bacon (Stage Manager)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
