Loitering youngsters, moped girls: in any case, there is no sign of parents or school. The girls laugh, are silent and quarrel, joke about `nice tits', flirt with a Moroccan boy (and call him a fucking fundamentalist when he walks off with another girl). In between, they ride their mopeds. A loosely acted draft of two young lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eD7Y7RzpHP8hN9ImBIZZ26ZzNB5.jpg", "actors": ["Ossama Boudra ()", "Sallie Harmsen ()", "Merle Minjon ()", "Tamara Rottenberg ()", "Max van Till ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
