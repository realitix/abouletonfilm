All 3 men had written their last letters to Kuljeet Kaur, Squadron Leader Vikram Singh, and Dr. Naqvi respectively. These letters were located 3 years later by IBN Reporter, Avinash Sarin, who entrusts them to two Indore-based slackers, Ali Shah and Sameer Suri, and asks them to deliver them to Chandigarh, Manali, and Leh respectively. Ali and Sameer set out to film this journey in order to get a graduation degree so that they can re-locate to America as well as televise it widely in order to convince the youth not to join any of India's armed forces.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eDzUTOdjNYGLXwEmD0iCcfEH23p.jpg", "actors": ["Salman Khan (Balkar Singh/Jassvinder Singh)", "Preity Zinta (Kuljeet Kaur)", "Sunny Deol (Vikram Shergill)", "Bobby Deol (Dhananjay \"DJ\" Shergill)", "Mithun Chakraborty (Dr. Naqvi)", "Sohail Khan (Sameer Suri a.k.a.
