The death of his father and a fishing trip with his brothers provide occasions when he could tell them, but he fails. When he screws his courage to the sticking point, how will they react, and how will he deal with their reactions? He imagines a movie of his rather boring life - surrounded by possibilities - but can anything overcome the insular narrow-mindedness of a big Irish Catholic family in Chicago?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pVcxWNSADwFjWOmOkXqu9WDmeqT.jpg", "actors": ["Pete Jones (Bobby Riley)", "Nathan Fillion (Luke Riley)", "Stoney Westmoreland (Connor Riley)", "Dev Kennedy (Jack Riley)", "Julie Pearl (Maggie Riley)", "Bob Riley (Mr. Riley)", "Michael McDonald (Andy)", "Dana Lynne Gilhooley (Carly)", "Jim Rose (Busboy / Priest)", "J.
