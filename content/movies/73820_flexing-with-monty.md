His gym is the very heart of his existence. He is aggressively male, outrageously narcissistic and a bigot. Sharing this strange world is Monty's cerebral and emotionally wounded younger brother, Bertin. One stormy day, the brothers' bizarre but settled lives are suddenly disrupted by the unexpected arrival of Lilith, a Catholic nun collecting contributions for an unusual cause. Lilith's arrival is the catalyst required to generate a momentous change in Bertin's relationship with his brother: a change that results in the astonishing and gruesome downfall of the vainglorious Monty.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/98hDln5TxF2w0rXItsJE9W0DDkk.jpg", "actors": ["Trevor Goddard (Monty)", "Rudi Davis (Bertin)", "Sally Kirkland (Lillith)", "Melinda Peterson (Mrs. Nog)", "Susan Tyrrell (Mrs. Nog (voice))", "Gwen Van Dam (Granny)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [172372], "youtube_key": "bFg2qrCRsQ4"}
