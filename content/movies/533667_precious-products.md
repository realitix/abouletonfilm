George, with his ever-present video-8 camera, attends an opening of Precious Products\u2014an exhibition of artworks satirizing art as commodity. He leaves the art world of San Francisco to spend a Christmas holiday with friends in their opulent home. Ironically, this is the home of a celebrity (another kind of commodity), Russian defector/ballerina Natalia Makanova. Surrounded by all the luxuries of life and Makanova\u2019s image, George muses about death. Panning over a dressing table laden with products, he focuses on a People magazine and comments, 'We are precious products, all of us.'", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jane Arkinstall (Herself)", "Lynda Diamond (Herself)", "Sharon Grace (Herself)", "George Kuchar (Himself)", "Griff Kwiat (Himself)", "Dennis Morrison (Himself)", "Ben Polsky (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
