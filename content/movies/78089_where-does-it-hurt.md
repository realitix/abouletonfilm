Hopfnagel, a greedy, crooked hospital administrator who has perfected the art of bill padding, unnecessary surgery and kickbacks. Mistrusted by patients, and resented by other staffers, his assistant Alice can no longer endure his scams and plots to have him sent to prison - but not for long enough. Sellers again steals the show with an absurd and hilarious character study.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pFvs2wzd75cuNdxzkL0Vn4srnDP.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Sellers (Dr. Albert T.
