Curiosity, Adventure &amp; Love is a the story of a woman raised by fate to go boldly where few young women of her time and upbringing would go, into the arms of chance and life. A young American woman leaves her country and all security behind, to begin an adventure in the Philippines that would witness the birth of a nation, a cruel war and Occupation and reconstruction. Jessie is a striking personality, somewhere between Scarlett O\u2019Hara and Amelia Earhart, who knew no boundaries and flew far ahead of her times, without regard to sex or society. Her story of a century well-lived is both rich and one that should restore our faith in our own humanity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eSwgorgbwEIjY5ahIYn3lI2EHNE.jpg", "actors": ["Jessie Lichauco (Herself)", "Carlos Celdran (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "-Bvm_sDJcfc"}
