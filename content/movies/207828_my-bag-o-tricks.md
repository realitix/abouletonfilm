Trixie Friganza performs first a story and then a song. For the story, she wears a wide-brimmed had and a matching diaphanous shawl. She tells of a visit to a friend who has a five-year old son. The mother tells Trixie a tale of stepping out on her husband, and to conceal the story from the boy, spells out key words. By the story's end, mom is in for a surprise and Trixie has a moral for us. Then, the hat and shawl come off, a base fiddle comes out, and Trixie sings us a comic song about her first two husbands.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oFpVh80K6fOfGimdtizp9MPbTBf.jpg", "actors": ["Trixie Friganza ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
