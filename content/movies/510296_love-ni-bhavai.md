This film sets up the bar of Gujuarati Cinema for sure. Arohi and Prateek performed well and I think this is the best movie of Malhar. The songs are so soft as silk, you can hear all the day long! Lyrics are touchy. Technically editing, background score, color grading, details are gives you perfect cinematic experience. Kudos team!"}], "recommandations_id": []}
