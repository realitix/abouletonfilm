Copper mining by a Japanese company in the mid-1990s led to violent protests and an ordinance banning future mining in the area. But when the Ecuadorean government sold mining rights to a Canadian copper company, renewed violence erupted.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6FM36dvonz1OWB33NgkwEg3KR98.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
