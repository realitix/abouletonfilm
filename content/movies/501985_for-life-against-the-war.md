Part of the protest festival Week of the Angry Arts, the epic compilation film incorporated minute-long segments which were sent from many corners of the country, spliced together and projected. The original presentation of the works was more of an open forum with no curation or selection, and in 2000 Anthology Film Archives preserved a print featuring around 40 films from over 60 submissions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sShQ2jZVJkpn4fHCKTgjpfsgh8v.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
