A business trip to check on a project called \u201cGalapagos in Greece\u201d by the islanders and for which his bank extended a loan and credit, brought him there. Being a German, he wants to investigate thoroughly, but Panos, a mini-mart owner, and the mayor try their utmost to sabotage him\u2014to camouflage a not-so-good reality.
