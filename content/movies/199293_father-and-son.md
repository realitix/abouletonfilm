Our trip will take two weeks. We\u2019re both documentary filmmakers so we\u2019ve decided to make a film recording the journey. We stop at camper parks or gas stations for the night. We each have a camera to keep the conditions fair and so we\u2019re both the directors and protagonists at the same time. My father is 70, I am 44. We discuss various things - family history, difficult past, my father\u2019s divorces. Any question is allowed. The journey is a pretext to get to know each other a little better. A cinematic-psychological experiment about the father-son relationship. Once in the editing room, will we be able to create a single version that would be acceptable to both?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
