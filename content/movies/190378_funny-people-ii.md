What would you do if you were walking along the street and a cute little lady rushed up to you and gave you a smashing kiss, as if you\\'d known each other for years?

Then there is the case of the bank note sticking out from under the wheel of a car. People will always be human and no-one will walk past without trying to pull it out, even if the mudguard comes off or the hooter suddenly starts blowing. The antics to get this note out will make you laugh until tears roll down your cheeks!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rJ0TDuOBE80DRhNoF2O0zv2kmXY.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Flynn ()", "Joe Stewardson (Narrator)", "Tani de Lange ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [47962], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
