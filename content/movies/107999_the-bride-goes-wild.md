Unfortunately, Greg, who is Uncle Bump, tends to drink too much and has not started his next book. Martha won a contest to illustrate the book and the first thing that happens is that Greg gets her soused. To keep her there to illustrate, John gets a juvenile delinquent named Danny to play his son and show how much pressure he is under. The ploy works at first, but Greg's heart was broken by Tillie, and Martha may be the girl who makes him forget all about her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c0S0TzqQXckPIcei1lFsu9YDjy3.jpg", "actors": ["Van Johnson (Greg Rawlings)", "June Allyson (Martha Terryton)", "Hume Cronyn (John McGrath)", "Jackie 'Butch' Jenkins (Danny)", "Una Merkel (Miss Doberly)", "Arlene Dahl (Tillie Smith Oliver)", "Lloyd Corrigan ('Pops')", "Richard Derr (Bruce Kope Johnson)", "Elisabeth Risdon (rs.
