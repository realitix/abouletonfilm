She is searching for Judith, the woman, she says to be in love with. It's bad luck for the women at the cash desk not to be Judith, because Eunice is eccentric, angry and extreme dangerous. One day she meets Miriam, hard of hearing and a little ingenuous, who feels sympathy for Eunice and takes her home. Miriam is very impressed by Eunice's fierceness and willfulness and follows her on the search for Judith. Shocked by Eunice's cruelty she tries to make her a better person, but she looses ground herself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tIN2dXB01aKycVqhcQ2PKTuQIhV.jpg", "actors": ["Amanda Plummer (Eunice)", "Saskia Reeves (Miriam)", "Kathy Jamieson (Wendy)", "Des McAleer (Eric McDermott)", "Lisa Riley (Danielle)", "Freda Dowie (Elsie)", "Paula Tilbrook (Ella)", "Fine Time Fontayne (Tony)", "Elizabeth McGrath (Waitress)", "Joanne Cook (Angela)", "Paul Bown (Gary)", "Emily Aston (Katie)", "Ricky Tomlinson (Robert)", "Katy Murphy (Judith)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [38096, 46989, 20712, 41801], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
