The decline has occurred amid a collapse of moral values and the victory of \u201cMala Italia\u201d over \u201cBuona Italia\u201d. It has been lauded as being ground-breaking in its creative combination of animation, interviews and hard facts, and has caused fierce controversy in Italy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/loJSlhj0U7qjamlF6lqpTyYDYJj.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Emmott (Himself)", "Silvio Berlusconi (Himself (also archive footage))", "Emma Bonino (Herself)", "Mario Calabresi (Himself)", "Sylvia De Fanti (Herself)", "Livia Giuggioli (Herself)", "John Elkann (Himself)", "Giampiero Judica (Himself)", "Sergio Marchionne (Himself)", "Mario Monti (Himself)", "Nanni Moretti (Himself)", "Alessandro Riceci (Himself)", "Toni Servillo (Himself)", "Marco Travaglio (Himself)", "Gina Nieri (Herself)", "Marcello Mastroianni (Augusto Rusconi (archive footage) (uncredited))", "Anna Magnani (Maddalena Cecconi (archive footage) (uncredited))", "Sophia Loren (Mara (archive footage) (uncredited))", "Hugh Grant (Himself (archive footage) (uncredited))", "Serena Dandini (Herself (archive footage) (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [216790, 18437, 58081, 12622], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
