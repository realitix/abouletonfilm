Aso, Japan. We decided to depict the most fascinating 'person' in Kurokawa, using the legends and folklore of Japan and Kurokawa that had passed down from ancient times as a base. The Japanese cast is comprised entirely of people actually living in Aso. We would be delighted to share Kurokawa's outlook and Japan with the people of the world.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
