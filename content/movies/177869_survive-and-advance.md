The unlikely squad made it to the national championship game against No. 1 Houston, aka Phi Slama Jama, a team featuring future NBA Top 50 all-time players Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler. NC State was one of the biggest underdogs ever in the final game, one that went down as possibly the best college basketball game in history-ending with one of the most well-known plays of all time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7w9YZnvsNAfdVbzvLfdn5w0yY4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [265330, 328346], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
