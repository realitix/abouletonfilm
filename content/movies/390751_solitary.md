Situated in rural Virginia, 300 miles from any urban center, Red Onion State Prison is one of over 40 supermax prisons across the US built to hold prisoners in eight-by-ten-foot cells for 23 hours a day. Filmed over the course of one year, this eye-opening film braids stark prison imagery, stories from correction officers, and intimate reflections from the men who are locked up in isolation. The inmates share the paths that led them to prison and their daily struggles to maintain their sanity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lV8zpTg05Z3AHIgVE8OfELGcOmN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
