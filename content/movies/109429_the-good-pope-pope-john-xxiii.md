When he feels a need to serve God, Angelo goes to study theology in Bergamo, and in Apollinare School (Rome) and becomes a priest. During his studies, he gets to know his two dearest friends, Mattia and Nicola. Very soon, most people see marvelous talents in him, including his wide knowledge and a constant readiness for sacrifice. The Holy See makes him go further to bishop and cardinal, and the Holy Father sends him to various places as a representative of the Church. When Pius XII dies on October, the 9th, 1958, 77 year-old Angelo goes to Rome, to conclave to choose a new pope. However, this time, it is him who hears gentle words of Jesus \"Tu es Petrus!\" (\"You are Peter!\") and from October, the 28th leads the church as pope John XXIII", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lQBk71sS6tHJn75O2s5CPZYGsj6.jpg", "actors": ["Bob Hoskins (Angelo Roncalli / Pope John XXIII)", "Carlo Cecchi (Cardinal Mattia Carcano)", "Roberto Citran (Monsignor Loris Capovilla)", "Fabrizio Vidale (Angelo Roncalli (young))", "Sergio Bini Bustric (Guido Gusso)", "Francesco Venditti (Nicola Catania (young))", "Rolando Ravello (Cannava)", "John Light (Mattia Carcano (young))", "Francesco Carnelutti (Nicola Catania)", "Lena Lessing (Marta Von Papen)", "Joan Giammarco ()", "Gianluca Ramazzotti ()", "Monica Piseddu ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
