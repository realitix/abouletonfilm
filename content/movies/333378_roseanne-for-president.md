I listened to what she was fighting for and it seems like she actually gets what low to middle-class want. But the main thing is she realizes the country is owned lock stock and barrel by the banks. That the Dollar is nothing buy debt, paper and is backed by nothing. The Federal Reserve isn't federal. What other corporation can print their own money? Marijuana should be legal. Both parties have had a shot at controlling and they both suck and everything gets worse, not better. You can't keep doing the same BS either party and expect a different outcome."}], "recommandations_id": []}
