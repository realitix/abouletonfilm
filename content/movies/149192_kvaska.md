He escapes and through complex and often very funny series of events ends up being the main star of the musical, only to be discovered by the police the day before the premiere...OK, enough spoilers! The story keeps going on... Lots of great dialogs, awesome music and singing, and ever-twisting story (plus, the parallels between the play's script and the real story) makes this one of the most enjoyable Czech movies I've seen in years (and I've seen many)! Definitely check it out if you like comedy, drama, musicals, and theater.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ov7i9ObdJBNGUCp5LWwPvf55cNv.jpg", "actors": ["Filip Tomsa (Micki)", "Lucie Vondr\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1 (Karin)", "Rudolf Hru\u0161\u00ednsk\u00fd nejml.
