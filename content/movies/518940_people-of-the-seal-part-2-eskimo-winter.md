Together, the two films provide insight and understanding of a culture now almost vanished, as they show the incredible resourcefulness of the Netsilik (People of the Seal) who have adapted to one of the world's harshest environments. Part 2: Eskimo Winter shows how Inuit families gather in communities on the sea ice to harpoon seal as they come up through breating holes in the ice. Also seen is the mid-winter season, a time of intense socializing in the communal igloo, with games, contests and ceremonial activities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oRvgfWqejS5jCo5koYSO1dyxfvU.jpg", "actors": ["Alexander Scourby (Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
