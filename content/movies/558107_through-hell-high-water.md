In reality they had no idea. Through Hell And High Water follows the incredible journey made by these two men. Rowing 2,930 miles, James and Ben recount their epic journey: a journey that sees them battle stormy weather, dehydration, life threatening conditions and colossal physical stress. At times, their remarkable voyage becomes a living hell, stretching their friendship to breaking point. Pushed physically, psychologically and emotionally to the limit, Ben and James often rowed naked to avoid serious chafing. They survived without water rations for 2 days, lost the few clothes they had in a freak wave, capsized, hallucinated, wept, fought, played games, grew beards and nursed blisters. Forty nine days later, they were the first pair to cross the finishing line, becoming the first ever British team to ever win the race.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d7m1b57LshRK5roGwVdrLqXnEoh.jpg", "actors": ["James Cracknell (Himself)", "Ben Fogle (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
