But before York is able to pull the trigger, Uforic tells him about a secret transaction involving a mysterious briefcase and a large amount of cash. This sets into motion a series of events that will inevitably involve much of the L.A. underworld and may just bring down corporate America. York tells Queel, a dirty cop, who tells Lucy, a homicidal stripper and is overheard by Carl Mauve, the greasy club owner, who hires Smith and Wesson, a pair of bungling thugs, who have it stolen from them by Norman, a pickpocket with a Jewish Dominatrix mother, who brings it to Dr. Zeus, a local Meth cook, who might just be able to solve the secret of the briefcase. Meanwhile an insane, bloodthirsty hit man named Versetti, working for a large multinational corporation, will stop at nothing to get it back.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cLHjCDAaUS7wVxkkWw78JQC4w2w.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
