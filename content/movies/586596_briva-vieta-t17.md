The film tells about the daily life and dreams of the youth community and a mute fish, the so-called commune T17. The community lives in a non-landscaped building, so its occupation is a real challenge. The house is located under the pasp\u0101rns of the association \" Free Riga \", whose movement is based on a responsible attitude towards nature and the careful use of resources. Here, the community is motivated by the conviction that so few resources in everyday life should be consumed in the urban environment. The film follows the everyday life of the community members, who use their lifestyle to use the resources of nature, material, culture and time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lam02WIdFu7GfQT2mc6AUs1fuBW.jpg", "actors": ["Patr\u012bcija Paula Zvejniece (Hershelf)", "Selga St\u016bris (Herself)", "Anna Fogele (Herself)", "Dzintars Briedis (Himself)", "M\u0101rcis Rubenis (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
