Starting in Cumberland, MD and going to Washington, DC, this short follows the man who pretty much just sees the various parts along the river. For a film from 1917, this isn't too impressive as the camera-work isn't anything special and you could say the story was very weak considering what other types of movies were being released at this time.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
