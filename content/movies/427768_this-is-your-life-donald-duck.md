But alas, Donald is relaxing at home, with no plans to leave any time soon. Literally dragged to the Disney Studio by his nephews, an outraged Donald relaxes a bit when he realizes that he's the guest of honor. Donald's life is recounted by such colleagues as Daisy Duck (who explains why she and Donald never married), Chip 'n' Dale, Mickey Mouse, Pluto, and even a few guest stars who never made a picture with the duck, including the Three Little Pigs, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Lady and the Tramp.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uxIzR1uR1n5stmpc3WTUDrWdHDm.jpg", "actors": ["Walt Disney (Himself: Host)", "Clarence Nash (Donald Duck / Huey / Dewey / Louie (voice))", "James MacDonald (Mickey Mouse / Chip (voice))", "June Foray (Grandma Duck / Daisy Duck (voice))", "Cliff Edwards (Jiminy Cricket (voice))", "Dessie Flynn (Dale (voice))", "Billy Bletcher (Pete (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [289179, 165854, 75818, 234818], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
