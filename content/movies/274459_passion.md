{"tmdb_id": 274459, "title": "Passion", "original_title": "\u53d7\u96e3", "slug_title": "passion", "date": "2013-12-07", "genre": ["Fantastique / Com\u00e9die / Drame"], "score": "5.4/10", "synopsis": "A singular deadpan comedy, The Passion tells a story of a young woman raised in a convent named Frances-ko (Mayuko Iwasa), after Saint Francesco. Distressed by not knowing about love and sex, she calls out for a sign from above, but instead hears a voice from below. A human-faced growth speaks to her from between her legs, constantly berating her, calling out \"Woman, you are worthless!\" Mr. Koga, as she names it, continues the verbal abuse, yet Frances-ko somehow adapts, forming an adversarial yet symbiotic relationship. This bizarre film, based on Kaoruko Himeno's acclaimed 1997 novel of the same name, is skillfully directed by Ryoko Yoshida, lensed by veteran cinematographer Akiko Ashizawa, grounded by Iwasa's show-stopping performance and enlivened by the hilarious Kanji Furutachi, who lends his voice to the chauvinistic Koga. The soundtrack boasts an unmissable eclectic score by legendary experimental musician and composer Otomo Yoshihide.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lhRwF8cJj9JGtqSrSwmC99n6k9y.jpg", "actors": ["Mayuko Iwasa ()", "Kanji Furutachi ()", "Kumiko Itou ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "4Bj516bHgiw"}
