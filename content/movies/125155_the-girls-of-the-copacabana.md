Las Chicas de Copacabana is a sexual coming age film from maverick filmmaker Jess Franco. Visually the film is bland when compared to Franco\u2019s most inspired films. To Franco\u2019s credit he does know how to photograph women. The shots of women on the beach and close up of their assets are this films strongest asset.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3DhtEngq11lHJXedE6IouQIpl5O.jpg", "actors": ["Michele Hermet (Juanita Martinez)", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Foulon (Hans)", "Leonardo da Costa (Juan Turan)", "Lina Romay (Lia)", "Nadine Pascal ((as Nadine Pascal))", "Olivier Mathot (Carlos Martin Frey de Acosta)", "Eduardo Hell ()", "V\u00edtor Mendes (Hans' Father)", "Antonio de Cabo (Lia's Father)", "Carmen Lucia ()", "Jean-Marie Lemaire (Roger)", "Juan Soler (Guitar Player)", "Daniel Lesoeur (Man in Telephone Booth)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
