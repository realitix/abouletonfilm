In the dreams, she is a young girl, and she runs from unknown terrors. Trying to understand her troubling dreams, Charlotte revisits part of her childhood, which comes back to her in a series of impressionistic memories. Charlie, her sister, Jobie, and her mother move in with her grandmother. It is 1944, and World War II rages in Europe and the Far East.
