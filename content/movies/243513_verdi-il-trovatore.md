Manrico's enemy in the region is led by the Count di Luna. From the outset, these two opposing forces are in conflict. Count di Luna loves Leonora, one of the queen's ladies in waiting. Ferrando, the captain of the guard narrates to his troops a terrible happening of 15 years ago: an old woman, accused of casting the evil eye over the count's brother, was burnt at the stake. The subsequent disappearance of the boy, followed by the discovery of a child's skeleton in the ashes, led to the conclusion that the woman's daughter, who was present at the burning, had thrown him into the flames to avenge her mother.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v4WmeTzCsffdkcKCdGlshXpFQif.jpg", "actors": ["Luciano Pavarotti (Manrico)", "Eva Marton (Leonora)", "Sherrill Milnes (El Conde de Luna)", "Dolora Zajick (Azucena)", "Jeffrey Wells (Ferrando)", "Loretta di Franco (In\u00e9s)", "James Levine (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
