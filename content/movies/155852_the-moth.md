Jan (Roman Wilhelmi) is the host of a nightly talk show in which he counsels people who call in with their problems. He is dedicated to helping these lonely souls but becomes increasingly disturbed when his co-workers and supervisors at the radio station do not appreciate his program; they seem unable to grasp the importance of what he is doing. Aside from that, Jan's private life is frayed around the edges. His wife is a heavy drinker and his mistress has no comprehension about who he is or what he is doing. Jan's frustration over this lack of recognition builds to an explosive level, threatening to upset the balance of his daily life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aPJW9DeBUZUtWwOFN1iE7Jchvq4.jpg", "actors": ["Roman Wilhelmi (Jan)", "Anna Seniuk (Magda, Jan's mistress)", "Iwona Bielska (Justyna, Jan's wife)", "Nela Obarska (Agata, Jan's ex-wife)", "Jerzy Trela (Jan's editor)", "Grzegorz Heromi\u0144ski (Tomek, Jan's producer)", "Marek Probosz (Marcin, Jan's son)", "Piotr Fronczewski (Psychiatrist)", "Jerzy Stuhr (\"Elegancki\" w barze)", "Zbigniew Buczkowski (Caller from Kalisz (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
