However, the hunt for Higgs is part of a much grander search for how the universe works. It promises to help answer questions like why we exist and is a vital part of a Grand Unified Theory of nature. At the heart of the pursuit of the elusive particle is the same feature that makes snowflakes beautiful and human faces attractive: the simple and enchanting idea of symmetry.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qee9ZoUG7ZP5dizHawhS3MaUs6b.jpg", "actors": ["Jim Al-Khalili (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
