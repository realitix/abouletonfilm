The lights around you glow and intensify. Breathe out. The glow diminishes. Take a deep breath. You rise up and glide across the seascape. DEEP VR is a meditative and psychoactive VR experience, controlled by the player\u2019s breathing. Discover a beautiful underwater seascape where the world challenges, surprises, and comforts.
