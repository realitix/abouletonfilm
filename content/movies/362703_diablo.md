But the opening scene and entire third act had me totally engrossed.\r\n\r\nThe supporting cast of _Diablo_ are all pretty on point. Particularly Walton Goggins. Even Danny Glover who is notorious for phoning it in these days does a good job. Unfortunately, Scott Eastwood in the lead role is abysmal. So poor in fact that it was all that held me back from giving _Diablo_ a \"Fresh\" rating.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"}], "recommandations_id": [249169, 113693, 291871, 174343]}
