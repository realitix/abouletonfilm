As his host looks very much like a vagrant the peasant dubs him 'Pousse-Pierre'. Actually Pousse-Pierre will prove very handy since he will save Miette, the farmer's daughter, and manage - at the risk of his own life - to have the murderer of a miller arrested. His superior reinstates him and the young man can marry Miette.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
