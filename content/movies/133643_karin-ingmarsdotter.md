It is the second part in Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m's large-scale adaption of Selma Lagerl\u00f6f's novel Jerusalem, following Sons of Ingmar from the year before, and depicting chapter three and four from the novel. The critical reception was however unenthusiastic and Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m decided to not direct any more parts. Eventually the suite was finished by Gustaf Molander in 1926.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wPZiVvCxxaYithesN3AcxHkw97P.jpg", "actors": ["Nils Ar\u00e9hn (Berger Sven Persson)", "Josua Bengtson (Eljas' friend)", "Bror Berger (Horse-dealer)", "Harriet Bosse (Brita)", "Carl Browallius (Eljas' father)", "Tyra D\u00f6rum ()", "Emil Fjellstr\u00f6m (Stark-Ingmar)", "Mona Geijer-Falkner (Customer)", "Algot Gunnarsson (Drinking companion)", "Eric Gustafson (Innkeeper's Son)", "G\u00f6sta Gustafson ()", "Paul Hallstr\u00f6m ()", "Tims Halvor ()", "Oscar Johansson (Vicar)", "William Larsson ()", "Thyra Leijman-Uppstr\u00f6m ()", "Nils Lundell (Eljas Elof Ersson)", "Wilma Malml\u00f6f ()", "Bertil Malmstedt (Lill-Ingmar)", "Gustaf Ranft (Horse-dealer)", "Margit Sj\u00f6blom ()", "Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m (Ingmar)", "Tora Teje (Karin Ingmarsdotter)", "Anna Thorell (Mrs. Storm)", "Ruth Weijden ()", "Tor Weijden (Halfvor)", "Olof \u00c5s (Inspector)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
