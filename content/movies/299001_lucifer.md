Lupita's brother Emanuel pretends he's paralyzed so he can drink and gamble while the two women tend to the sheep. Lucifer senses an opportunity and plays the miraculous healer. He forces Emanuel to walk again, seduces Maria and makes Lupita doubt about her faith. He didn't bring bad luck, he only illuminated the line between good and evil, where it didn't exist before.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lRvYnqwrhlzClxwOZLTPGjxN7zP.jpg", "actors": ["Gabino Rodr\u00edguez (Lucifer)", "Norma Pablo (Maria)", "Ana Maria Acosta (Lupita)", "Jeronimo Soto Bravo (Emanuel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [316893], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
