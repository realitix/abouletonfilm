In an historic migration after World War II, Hasidism found it's most vital center in America. Both challenging and embracing American values, Hasidim seek those things which many Americans find most precious: family, community, and a close relationship to God. Integrating critical and analytical scholarship with a portrait of the daily life, beliefs, and history of contemporary Hasidic Jews in New York City, the film focuses on the conflicts, burdens, and rewards of the Hasidic way of life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2Gh4zYCGJ9CELXnBJiWeaWGJCnP.jpg", "actors": ["Leonard Nimoy (Narrator)", "Sarah Jessica Parker (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
