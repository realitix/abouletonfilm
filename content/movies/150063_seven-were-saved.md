The passengers include a Japanese colonel on his way to Manila to face war-crime charges, and a couple who were married on the day they were liberated from a Japanese prison camp. During the flight, the colonel breaks away from his guards, causes the plane to go out of control, and it crashes into the sea. The survivors get into a rubber boat and go through a minor-league version of \"Lifeboat, with no Alfred Hitchcock sightings, until Air-Sea Rescue pilot Jim Willis rides to the rescue.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Ag3xt1zDXPYVc4bFkJmzRY9qWHJ.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Denning (Capt Allen Danton)", "Catherine Craig (Susan Briscoe)", "Russell Hayden (Capt Jim Willis)", "Ann Doran (Mrs Rollin Hartley)", "Richard Loo (Colonel Yamura)", "Byron Barr (Lt.
