It will unzip America's obsession with sex, both from a cinematic and social perspective, exposing the hypocrisy inherent in our culture's war against eroticism (be it film, art, literature or song lyrics).  The special will look at many films that push the boundary, from mainstream studio films to product that in its time has been considered pornographic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/litbuJgGIbhVROYF1Uv1rGcrfhQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "mHdisRJ-nNQ"}
