Upon learning that his mother was a prostitute, Frank (Daniel Gelin) dejectedly vows that he, too, will live a life of debauchery. Part of his self-degradation program is to kill someone, and since the story takes place during the Nazi occupation of France, he chooses a German officer as his victim. His steady descent into psychosis and depravity becomes his ultimate undoing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lukd2O5c7TZ7qwGT2QxHwPTNRZm.jpg", "actors": ["Daniel G\u00e9lin (Frank Friedmayer)", "Daniel Ivernel ()", "Marie Mansart ()", "V\u00e9ra Norman ()", "Nadine Basile ()", "Paul Faivre ()", "Jo\u00eblle Bernard ()", "Camille Gu\u00e9rini ()", "Denyse R\u00e9al ()", "Claude Vernier ()", "Jo Dest ()", "Pierre Duncan ()", "Henri San Juan ()", "Robert Moor ()", "Jean-Pierre Mocky ()", "Jimmy Urbain ()", "Antoine Balp\u00eatr\u00e9 ()", "Valentine Tessier ()", "Micheline Gary ()", "Georges Tabet ()", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Valmain ()", "Andr\u00e9e Tainsy ()", "Hans Verner ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
