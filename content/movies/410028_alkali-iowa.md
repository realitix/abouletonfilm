But things become clearer for him when he discovers via a rusty old lunch box filled with gay magazines that his father, killed in Vietnam, led a double life down on the farm. But as liberating as the discovery is for Jack, it is painful for his grandfather and mother, who have tried for years to keep it a family secret. Now Jack must decide whether to share this new information with his younger sister or allow it to remain buried a while longer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aBkLEaHiOBFiaBha8bw6J0Bnk11.jpg", "actors": ["J.D.
