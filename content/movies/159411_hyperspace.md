Gremloids when the character Lord Buckethead appeared as a voting candidate for the 2017 UK General Election after making his appearance on \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\" and the character has become a hero in both that election and on the Internet.\r\n\r\nAfter that it was natural that I really wanted to see this film and I have to say I absolutely enjoyed it, I had tons of laughs out of this and it's an absolute blast of a fun film to watch, the only thing that could have been better would be the ending but oh well. It an obscure movie that deserves its place as a cult classic and maybe thanks to Lord Buckethead's new fame, more people will know of this wonderful film."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
