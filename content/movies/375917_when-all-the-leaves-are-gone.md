She deeply misses the loving environment of the reserve she once called home, and her isolation is sharpened by her father\u2019s serious illness. When Wato\u2019s teacher reads from a history book describing First Nations peoples as ignorant and cruel, it aggravates her classmates\u2019 prejudice.
