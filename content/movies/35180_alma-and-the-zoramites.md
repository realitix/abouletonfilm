Alma and Amulek fail to persuade the rich Zoramites to  repent. Alma ministers to the poor believers and teaches one of the most important lessons on faith and humility. Zoram forces the believers in Antionum from their land where they finally find refuge with Lamanite converts in Jershon.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vZcQSEHZOO0ids2N0w53bO2TIPD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
