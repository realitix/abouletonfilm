Their den, a burrow that\u2019s borrowed from the meerkats, provides underground shelter and the foxes wait out the long, dry months, determined to survive.  It is a lean time between rains and our bat-eared fox family must outsmart hungry Jackals, Cheetahs and Lions. Their super sensitive ears alert them to predators and help them find food.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kkiKsYcQ2sEx0ZA6ionpyDVrOso.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
