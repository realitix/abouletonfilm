Born to a noble Roman family, Perpetua converts to Christianity when she is irresistibly drawn to the example of unselfish love and service that she witnesses in the local believers.  Along with slaves Felicity and Revocutus, she makes her way to a secret gathering of the Church, unaware that the Emperor Septimius Severus has issued a decree prohibiting new conversions to Christianity.  Arrested and tried, Perpetua, Felicity and their companions take a valiant stand that echoes down through the centuries.  Suspenseful! Moving! Inspiring!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/adBC5yGBazNd6XZOb2II8CrknMz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
