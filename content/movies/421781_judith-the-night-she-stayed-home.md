Judith Myers and her best friend D'arcy Mims are planning a Halloween night camp-out at The Myers House with their friends. Judith is trying to forget the growing tensions in her family and wants to immerse herself in a carefree celebration, but her reclusive brother's presence casts an ominous shadow over their cheerful preparations. This short film breaths life into an often overlooked character from John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN - Judith Myers may have only had a short appearance in the classic film, but she nevertheless played a crucial role in the forming of the Michael Myers story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/deQbplPk38fxVrlOawOCjEPAq1B.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
