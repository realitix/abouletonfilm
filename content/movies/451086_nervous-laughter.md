It\u2019s called Peahi, or \u201cJaws,\u201d and every year it attracts dozens of elite surfers from around the world to attempt the lethal wave. More and more, however, it\u2019s the local crew that steals the show. An eclectic group childhood friends that followed each other into the Jaws lineup as teenagers, and through peer pressure and rivalries, pushed each other to unprecedented performances in the ensuing years. Then came the El Ni\u00f1o of 2016, which promised to serve up the largest swells in big-wave history. Follow the crew for an inside look at a season rife with nerves, injury, triumph and friendship.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dkR6xJ9OfG6IsmKUbjuKALtjdAk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
