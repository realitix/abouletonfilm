I wish at the time that I had known about the event--the one time Jamie Lee Curtis agreed to appear at a horror convention, in order to raise funds for her favourite charity; namely, the children's hospital of Los Angeles--for I would have gone in a heartbeat. I haven't watched much of her work, admittedly, but I loved her performances in the four 'Halloween' films I have seen her in, as well as 'The Fog', 'True Lies' and 'A Fish Called Wanda'. As she stated about the convention itself, the film--as a documentary of a moment in time, and of horror fans' love for her work--was top-notch, and the extra is well worth a watch, both for fans of Curtis' work and for those wanting to investigate the subculture of horror fans in general. It's a fun hour worth spending."}], "recommandations_id": [522440, 316436, 550464, 26054], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
