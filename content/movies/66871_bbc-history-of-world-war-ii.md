The collection is filled with poignantly fascinating moments, such as when an aging American veteran revisits the Omaha Beach he stormed on D-Day, and meets the elderly German who, as a teenager, was defending that section of the beach with his machine gun, or footage of Hitler's early political speeches, raging promises of things to come.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lQxXMls5AA7CeJAgCGkbGeZyrvn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
