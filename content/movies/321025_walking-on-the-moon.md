Bright, capable of looking after himself, streetwise, he's the last person you'd expect to become a victim of bullying. But after he comes to the aid of a victimized school-friend, Daniel becomes the target of systematic, ruthless and destructive abuse. It starts as a personal battle between Daniel and his teenage aggressors - but it soon becomes clear that it's aided and abetted by the very people Daniel might rely upon to help - the teachers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tP4mcGTzCTVh6YJ71bkafZeCki.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
