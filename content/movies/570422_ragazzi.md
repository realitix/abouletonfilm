There, they see Lisa. Alexandre is the shy one, but he is also the one with the greatest yen to meet such a woman. He and Romain track Lisa down the next day and, though she is already dating someone, when Romain approaches her, she agrees to meet the two of them at a restaurant. They are dismayed when the part-Italian girl brings her mother with her as a chaperone. Other difficulties arise as well, and they resolve that this quest is less important than their friendship. Besides, Alexandre has by now discovered the charms of Romain's younger sister.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m5qBIzaLfcGRG45ZRJs0PY83XO2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
