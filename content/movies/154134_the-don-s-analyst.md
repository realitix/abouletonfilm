The world has changed and he hasn't. He'd like to retire, but if he left the \"family business\" to his two idiot sons, they'd be dead in a minute. So he decides to go legit, which convinces everyone that he must be completely off the deep end. To preserve their cushy lives, his dysfuntional family conspires to get him some psycho-therepy. So his boys kidnap a \"piasan\" shrink and order him to \"fix\" their father. This film, which premired on Showtime, pre-dated the very similarly plotted \"Analyze This\" by over a year.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uK8AeLTgFu844fQWI18aeYcxY0p.jpg", "actors": ["Rick Aiello (Frankie Leoni)", "Robert Cicchini (Donnie Leoni)", "Robert Loggia (Don Vito Leoni)", "Angie Dickinson (Victoria Leoni)", "Kevin Pollak (Dr. Julian Riceputo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
