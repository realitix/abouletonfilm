But nothing is straightforward and simple. From Russia \"the run\" continues to Constantinople, to Paris, back to Russia. Some of them have understood that they can't live outside Russia and go back maybe to be happy, maybe not, some go back to face sure death for their crimes, some don't go back and know that are going to miss homeland forever, some are comfortably well off (are they?) in exile. Sentimental without syrup, tragic and comical at the same time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v0Sy5iLMxJHtnOcOchy35kvYLdJ.jpg", "actors": ["Aleksey Batalov (Sergei Pavlovich Golubkov)", "Ludmila Savelyeva (Serafima Vladimirovna Korzukhina)", "Vladislav Dvorzhetsky (General Khludov)", "Mikhail Ulyanov (General Charnota)", "Oleg Efremov (Colonel)", "Evgeniy Evstigneev (Korzukhin)", "Nikolay Olyalin (Krapilin)", "Vladimir Basov (Artur Arturovich, the Cockroach Tsar)", "Bruno Frejndlikh (General Vrangel)", "Vladimir Zamanskiy (Baev)", "Vladimir Osenev (Tikhiy)", "Gotlib Roninson (Voluptuous Greek)", "Tamara Loginova (Lichiko)", "Roman Khomyatov (Frunze)", "Tatyana Tkach (Lyuska)", "\u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u041c\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043d ()", "Stanislav Khitrov (Anyuan)", "Aleksandr Titov ()", "Aleksandr Yanvaryov (Golovan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [69839, 27922, 74045, 83555], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
