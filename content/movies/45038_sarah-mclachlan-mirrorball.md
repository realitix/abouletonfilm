Always a strong, charismatic singer, McLachlan now conjures a rare balance of delicacy and power, measured here in performances of signature songs that add a new, more muscular edge matching her band's rock firepower. Thus, \"Possession\" expands beyond its already sensual promise to touch on truly erotic abandon, while \"Building a Mystery\" focuses its portrait of a narcissistic poseur with a harder edge and a newly amended, R-rated lyric that's entirely appropriate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/scw8ZytxI6RCz5pSCbKd2nlwr1R.jpg", "actors": ["Sarah McLachlan (Herself - Vocals, Guitar, Piano)", "Ashwin Sood (Himself - Drums, Percussion)", "Brian Minato (Himself - Bass Guitar)", "Camille Henderson (Herself - Backing Vocals)", "David Sinclair (Himself - Electric, Acoustic Guitar)", "Sean Ashby (Himself - Electric, Acoustic, Pedal Steel Guitar)", "Vince Jones (Himself - Keyboards)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
