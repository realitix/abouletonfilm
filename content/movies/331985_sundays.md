The end of the world seems like a nightmare to Ben. A memory of a past life that doesn\u2019t belong to him. When Ben starts to remember Isabelle, the only love he\u2019s ever known, he realises she\u2019s missing in his life. An existential descent into confusion and the desperate need to find out the truth begins. This reality depicts a stunning, surprising and dark world.
