In this fascinating meld of career retrospective and film essay, Greenfield offers a meditation on her extensive body of work, structuring it through the lens of materialism and its increasing sway on culture and society in America and throughout the world. Underscoring the ever-increasing gap between the haves and the have-nots, her portraits reveal a focus on cultivating image over substance, where subjects unable to attain actual wealth instead settle for its trappings, no matter their ability to pay for it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lMTdKAKTrZqHZ2t6Cnit0SBAcbz.jpg", "actors": ["Florian Homm (Himself)", "Bret Easton Ellis (Himself)", "Kim Kardashian (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "fyfC1AVhfb8"}
