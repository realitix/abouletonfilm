This short documentary shows the capital of the Cameroon, Yaond\u00e9, but might equally show other African cities: heaps of rubbish lie at the edge of streets, academics are out of work, officials unpaid, corruption is the norm, and misery everywhere. For Jean-Marie Teno 'colonization, civilization, independence, then humanitarian talk are merely excuses and theatrical gestures to ensure that Africa remains the place which foreign powers can exploit with a good conscience.'", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5diRinTS8SIHnVHGFDT3OiYjZxc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
