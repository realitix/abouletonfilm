Have you ever dreamed that you could meet the woman you've always dreamed of? Have you ever been so in love with your best friend that you would do anything to make sure that you got a slice? Well, Serena Blair's future is nothing like she imagined. She's a high tech computer whiz, but what happens next is beyond any dream she could ever have imagined, beyond any dream woman, and beyond any little crush. When her computer Celeste comes to life, downloading her Artificial Intelligence into a real live woman, Serena's life takes a turn she never expected. Her bank account is filled with cash, hoards of new furniture and new clothes show up at her house, and Celeste even brokers a ripe lesbian relationship for her creator, as if she knows everything the world has to offer in the blink of an eye.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7NKaPZnUIFZs0gM20p6Gyzzn743.jpg", "actors": ["Celeste Star ()", "Alexis Texas ()", "Kalina Ryu ()", "Serena Blair ()", "Alix Lynx ()", "Dahlia Sky ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
