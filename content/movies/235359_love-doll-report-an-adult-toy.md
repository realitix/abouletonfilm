This is another softcore pinku eiga melodrama dealing with the proverbial \u201cDutch wife\u201d (a Japanese slang term for love dolls), given an unusually clever treatment by Nikkatsu\u2019s leading director, Chusei Sone. Nobutaka Masutomi stars as a doctor who develops a robot love doll to keep a team of Antarctic researchers company, but is displeased with the result despite the product\u2019s success. His desire to create a more realistic doll leads the doctor to model one after an attractive college student (Maya Hiromi). Naomi Oka co-stars, and the screenplay was by Atsushi Yamatoya, who had directed the subgenre\u2019s most notorious cult film, Koya No Dacchi Waifu, in 1967.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oNDf0QX6FXS2Q1wtkfhKu4LerG7.jpg", "actors": ["Hiromi Maya (College Girl Model / South Pole #2 Robotic Sex Doll)", "Nobutaka Masutomi (South Pole Doctor)", "Naomi Oka (BB Robotic Sex Doll)", "G\u00f4 Awazu ()", "Ichiro Kijima ()", "Toshihiko Oda ()", "Hiroko Fuji ()", "Sanae Shiba ()", "Arisa \u014cgi ()", "Asuka Miyazaki ()", "Hidetoshi Kageyama ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
