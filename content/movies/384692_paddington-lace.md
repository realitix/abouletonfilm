This is a fully dramatised film, which captures the essence of Paddington, not only by striking visuals of the Old-Sydney architecture in the area, but by re-enacting the mood and lifestyle of some typical, bohemian inhabitants. Scripted by Joan Long. Music by Grahame Bond and Rory O'Donaghue. Starring Ross Thompson, Janne Wesley and Ron Blanchard.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iBf8ElLtXSagQekKRN9P9Zy9F8W.jpg", "actors": ["Ross Thompson ()", "Ron Blanchard ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
