Hammer was invited to have a retrospective in summer, 1994, at the first Gay and Lesbian film festival on the African continent. She wanted to do more than screen her films and videos; she wanted to teach video production skills in the townships. These workshops provide the deeply moving stories lesbians and gays told to one another.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qjzouY9PV5QNfVWQCf1DEWlm2lH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
