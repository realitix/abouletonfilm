Millions of people have journeyed to Medjugorje to see for themselves, and nearly all describe a sense of peace they've never felt before. Could it be real? These seven strangers investigate the truth: a young mother with stage 4 cancer, an atheist from England, a man suffering from ALS, a heroin addict and former felon, an atheist police officer, a father of nine who lost his wife to cancer, and a woman questioning her faith. Will their climb up Apparition Hill lead them to a modern-day miracle or a spectacular hoax?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cI0thbI7aoHaFbKHobTBp2DU7sc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
