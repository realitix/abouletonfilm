Both the book and the film that came out of it tell about children's parties spending their holidays near the sports airport. The newly scanned airplane first assigns to aliens, then suspects them of espionage, but in the end it will explain everything. Children will even find the courage to take part in an aviation trip. According to period reviews, the film was a bad thing to teachers, as they said it was inappropriate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gole1pGEvMhTi4IyMThxwtcSCUM.jpg", "actors": ["Zuzana Ondrouchov\u00e1 (Anezka)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
