'The Witness' has become a cult classic, well received by critics and general audiences when it was finally released outside of Hungary. 'The Witness' takes place during the height of the R\u00e1kosi Era, which was closely modeled after the ruthless and brutal Stalin regime. The film follows the life of an ordinary dike keeper, J\u00f3zsef Pelik\u00e1n, who has been caught for illegally slaughtering his pig, Dezs\u00f5. Instead of doing hard time for his \"heinous\" crime, Pelik\u00e1n is elevated into an important position, generally reserved for the communist elite. His new benefactor, the mysterious Comrade Vir\u00e1g, is reluctant to reveal the real reason behind Pelik\u00e1n's preferential treatment. Thus, begins Pelik\u00e1n's hilarious adventure deep within the \"sophisticated\" communist society... Until one day, when he gets called for to return the \"favour\" by falsely testifying against his long-time friend in a mock-up show trial.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lM5cgYbC749ajupyqwWuI5tpRSK.jpg", "actors": ["K\u00e1llai Ferenc (Pelik\u00e1n J\u00f3zsef, g\u00e1t\u0151r)", "\u0150ze Lajos (Vir\u00e1g \u00c1rp\u00e1d)", "B\u00e9la Both (B\u00e1stya elvt\u00e1rs)", "Zolt\u00e1n F\u00e1bri (D\u00e1niel Zolt\u00e1n)", "Lili Monori (Gizi, Pelik\u00e1n l\u00e1nya)", "K\u00e1roly Bicskey (Elem\u00e9r Guly\u00e1s)", "Gy\u00f6rgy K\u00e9zdy (Vir\u00e1g test\u0151re)", "J\u00f3zsef Horv\u00e1th (Vasutas)", "R\u00f3bert R\u00e1tonyi (Operettsz\u00edn\u00e9sz)", "Gy\u00f6rgy B\u00e1lint ()", "P\u00e1l B\u00e1n\u00f3 (B\u00edr\u00f3)", "M\u00e1ria Dud\u00e1s (G\u00e9p\u00edr\u00f3n\u0151)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [104515, 104707, 41080, 41062], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
