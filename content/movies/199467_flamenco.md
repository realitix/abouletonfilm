{"tmdb_id": 199467, "title": "Flamenco", "original_title": "Duende y misterio del flamenco", "slug_title": "flamenco", "date": "1952-06-13", "genre": [""], "score": "5.0/10", "synopsis": "This 79-minute documentary, per its title, is a nonstop display of the best flamenco dancers in Spain. Among the flamenco kings and queen spotlighted herein are Pilar Lopez, Antonio, Maria Luz, Pacita Tomas and Roberto Ximenez. Also on hand (and on their toes) are the Ballet Espagnol and bullfighter Juan Belmonte. To non-fans, the film may seem too much of a good thing; perhaps it would have worked better as a short subject. The English-language version was subtitled by NY Herald Tribune dance-critic Walter Terry. Flamenco was lensed in Cinecolor, which emphasized blue and red above all else.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ea6KGmFOk2HxAQ6vjM7OCYYLvUS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
