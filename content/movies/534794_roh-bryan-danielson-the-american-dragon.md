Crisp technical wrestling, vicious submissions, and fierce strikes are just some of the hallmarks Danielson brings to the table every time he enters the squared circle.  It was those attributes that eventually brought him to the ROH World Title and helped establish a reign that will forever stand tall in ROH\u2019s history books. With battles against AJ Styles, CM Punk, Austin Aries, Jushin Liger & Jay Briscoe, amongst many others, this 2-Disc set is a look at 13 of the best matches from the early years of Bryan Danielson's ROH career. From his \u201cEpic Encounter\u201d with Paul London to the beginning stages of Bryan\u2019s historic ROH World Championship run, these matches are part of what define him as an ROH Legend. This is Bryan Danielson, this is wrestling, this is The American Dragon.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z6U2WMqMxRn0TKAiqcL8hpSHus5.jpg", "actors": ["Bryan Danielson (Bryan Danielson)", "Allen Neal Jones (AJ Styles)", "Phillip Jack Brooks (CM Punk)", "Nuufolau Joel Seanoa (Samoa Joe)", "Keiichi Yamada (Jushin Liger)", "Daniel Christopher Covell (Christopher Daniels)", "Paul London (Paul London)", "Jamin Pugh (Jay Briscoe)", "James Howard Gibson (James Gibson)", "Brandon Silvestry (Low Ki)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
