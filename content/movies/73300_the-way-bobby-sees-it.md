Adding to the difficulty: Bobby is legally blind. With the help of a guide and a rigorous training schedule, Bobby is determined to race his bike down a course riddled with obstacles and flanked by steep, life-threatening cliffs. But, the racecourse isn't the only challenge in Bobby's life. Between thrills, spills and jaw dropping helmet camera footage, we see how Bobby uses humor, determination, and unshakeable optimism to battle adversity - both on and off the bike.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Bobby McMullen (Himself)", "Jason Allen (Guide)", "Andy Freesian (Guide)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Zwflw71zDns"}
