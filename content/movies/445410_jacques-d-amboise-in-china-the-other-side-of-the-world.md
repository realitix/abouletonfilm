Their goal: to create a special performance using a variety of dance styles - including hip-hop, freestyle jazz and traditional Chinese folk dance - that would premiere at the Shanghai Grand Theatre in honor of the 2007 Shanghai Special Olympics World Games. Part of a month-long cultural exchange between d'Amboise's National Dance Institute and several Chinese troupes, featuring some of that country's most talented young dancers, the collaboration underscored the power of dance to transcend obstacles of culture and language.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vHkue0rcq2qPW6NOQ3W7J9bxly7.jpg", "actors": ["Jacques d'Amboise (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
