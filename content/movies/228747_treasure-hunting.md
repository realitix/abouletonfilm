He finds a car and gets in. C/U of him driving. He makes funny faces at the audience. He stops and looks around (seems like he is in the same place so hasn't really been driving.) Suddenly the car lurches off. The car careers down a hillside. We see the car driving along at great speed with Jerry's feet sticking out of the back. Jerry shouts for help and says a prayer. He tries to get out. He shouts \"What'll I do?\" An aircraft pilot responds with: \"Stick it Jerry!\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gRkUe2YpfAFLBOs6QdmGn0AJUPn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
