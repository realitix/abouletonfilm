This attempt increased in scale and ambition as they pushed it further, resulting in the theatricalisation of life. In other words, the boundaries between real events and fabricated drama became blurred as the portrayal of life became more exaggerated. It is important to remember that the film does not represent what actually happened during the 1917 Revolution, but is rather an adaptation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xWkSEt2vONtFrmaw5DZ5vMkYIqG.jpg", "actors": ["Boris Barnet ()", "Ivan Bobrov ()", "Aleksandr Gromov ()", "Vasili Nikandrov ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
