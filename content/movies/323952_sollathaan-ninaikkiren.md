Sivakumar falls in love with Jayachitra. However, things take a turn to the worse in the typical Balachander style when Jayachitra sacrifices herself to the whims of a playboy, played by Kamal Haasan in order to save her friend (Jayasudha) from his exploits. What happens next, who marries whom, is the crux of a dramatic climax. The movie turns the entire concept of romantic movies by its head - the concept being that the hero does not always have to get the girl.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hYBZ0a4K8HLsA7o2QlfeoAmijOy.jpg", "actors": ["Sivakumar ()", "Jayachitra ()", "Jayasudha ()", "Srividhya ()", "Kamal Haasan ()", "Poornam Viswanathan ()", "S.
