By 1941, literally hundreds of RAF fighters and bombers needed to be flown each day between aircraft factories, maintenance depots and RAF aerodromes. This vital task was carried out by the men and women of the ATA, a civilian air force operating from their own pools and stations all over Britain. Essentially a dramatised account of typical ATA deliveries, the film features coverage of the ATA's own fleet of Ansons, as well as being notable for some excellent Spitfire film and very rare footage of the Whitley bomber, including take off and in-cockpit sequences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y42SvPnIEVgDQRV13Blj1pbwcxo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
