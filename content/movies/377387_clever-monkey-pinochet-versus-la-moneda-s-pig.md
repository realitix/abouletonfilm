Based on improvisations and collective creation work, groups of pre-schoolers, adolescents, and university students from different social, cultural, and political origins, recreate history through mise-en-scenes that come from their own imaginations. The film articulates this creative vortex in a multiple-narrative flowing cinematic mosaic that gives an account of contemporary Chile by reliving its past.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2giA77UJZClBxehHKJ01EpujGb8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
