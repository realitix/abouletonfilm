Narrated by William Shatner, and accompanied by a special digital \"surround\" recording of Antonio Vivaldi's The Four Seasons, the film takes audiences on a breathtaking trip through the eruption of spring, the growth of summer, the harvest and festivity of autumn, and the dormancy of winter. The beauty of the seasons is interspersed with a look at the earth as a planet, the sun as a star, and the human quest to understand the relationship between the two.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/40L4sqFmAKGxensc8F0Nv5aiTG9.jpg", "actors": ["William Shatner (Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
