Fourteen days later, on May 20, all that changed when he suffered a devastating leg injury at the Preakness.  Barbaro captures his spectacular victory and promising future; the heartbreaking events two weeks later at Pimlico; and the challenging medical procedures used to try and save the horse's life. Despite the odds, the Jacksons remained amazingly dedicated and never relinquished hope, with the medical expertise of Dr. Dean Richardson enabling Barbaro to survive in the wake of his accident. On Jan. 29, 2007, however, Barbaro's valiant struggle came to an end when he was euthanized after the pain from his injuries and subsequent surgeries became too great to sustain.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y8IbqHue6FELdNgyD9GR7Qv3zhT.jpg", "actors": ["Liev Schreiber (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
