The seven discs included in this three-volume set have virtually all of Lloyd's 1920s features, most of his talking pictures, and a healthy collection of shorts. Because Lloyd--a canny businessman--retained control over much of his output, the films have remained under his (and his estate's) control through the decades, and the quality of the key titles is generally excellent.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t0xM8bboZd69DnpmGLr70KgbTEr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
