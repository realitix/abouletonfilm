For the first time in his mushroom-taking history, he had an experience of \"divine possession,\" in which he felt that a divine being took possession of his body and spoke through him, in a voice that was not his, and with knowledge that he himself did not possess. He later tried several times to repeat the experience. I WAS POSSESSED BY GOD is the documentary record of one such attempt.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xuAY4V3aMyh5q31jvCyi125XRqH.jpg", "actors": ["Caveh Zahedi (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
