A silent movie-style opening title informs us that the town needs a new fire engine, so they decide to stage a play to raise the money. (Nothing more is heard about this, but the finale involves a fire emergency at the theater.) In the opening scene the community players rehearse at the home of the director, a pompous lady named Mrs. Winters. Harry, of course, is The Stage Hand.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Harry Langdon (Harry)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
