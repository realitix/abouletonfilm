Juxtaposing sexual passion with sexual fear, the lesbian eroticism presented by Bociurkiw is inscribed with danger and courage. Using the 1990's summer raid at the Sex Garage in Montreal as a backdrop, Bociurkiw positions her film as a vibrant and pointed critic of the political and social abuse against the homosexual communities.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
