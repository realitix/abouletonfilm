Nowhere on Earth is hit worse than the Korean peninsula. Ha-jin, a sly, savvy orphan, prowls the rubble of a broken, barely functioning Busan wracked by daily tremors. Her petty crimes land her in jail, and from there the clutches of human traffickers \u2014 and finally far out to sea, rescued (or rather, kidnapped?) by a ragtag band of pirates seeking the precious crystals at the heart of a volcanic island. To reach their prize, they\u2019ll need to defeat the island\u2019s fearsome guardian, the legendary volcano whale. And to do that, they\u2019ll need Ha-jin\u2019s special talent for summoning whales. But is her rare power a blessing, or a curse?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pyBijs2SifE3TgHuxXewbCaFl57.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
