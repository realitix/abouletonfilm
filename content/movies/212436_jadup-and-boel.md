That is, until a stranger finds a book that Jadup (Kurt B\u00f6we) gave to the young refugee Boel (Katrin Knappe), who resettled in the town over 30 years ago. Painful memories about Boel and the post-war period begin to surface and shake up the whole town. Boel vanished back then and nobody knew why. Word spread about a rape and some tried to blame a Russian soldier. Jadup, the town's respected and popular mayor, remembers, though, how he mistrusted Boel and did not help her through this difficult time; HE didn't even notice THAT Boel loved him. Jadup's confrontation with the past gives him a new, critical view of his current situation and surroundings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xnQi10VDiHxiMKKN405J85oek81.jpg", "actors": ["Kurt B\u00f6we (Jadup)", "Katrin Knappe (Boel)", "Gudrun Ritter (Barbara)", "K\u00e4the Reichel (Frau Martin)", "Franciszek Pieczka (Unger)", "Michael Gwisdek (Gwissen)", "Dieter Bellmann (Mitarbeiter)", "Horst Lebinsky ()", "Evelyn Cron ()", "Christian Grashof ()", "Heide Kipp ()", "Heidemarie Schneider ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
