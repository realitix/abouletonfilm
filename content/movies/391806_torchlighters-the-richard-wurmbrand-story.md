Instead, Pastor Richard Wurmbrand chooses to speak up for Christ, thereby placing his own life and the lives of his family in great danger. When Richard's choice lands him in a communist prison, his faith and witness are tested to the limits. See how this Torchlighter's amazing story continues to impact the world today.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
