This interesting docudrama follows the tragic outcome of that movement for one of its leaders, the pacifist and nearly beatific Samuel Lount (also the great-great-great uncle of producer Elvira Lount). The orator and journalist William Lyon Mackenzie stoked up the fire among the property-deprived, and a march on Toronto was begun. Lount was convinced to join the rebellion much against his better judgment -- he belonged to the Children of Peace religious sect. Lount's own pacifism meant nothing to the authorities; they executed Lount for treason after crushing the rebellion. R.H. Thomson plays the title role in this low-budget but high-energy effort.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p7JV2F92pcudkmmgmZehXGV4ShS.jpg", "actors": ["Malcolm Black (Peter Matthews)", "David Bolt (Dr. Rolph)", "Donald Davis (Bishop Strachan)", "George Dawson (Alderman Powell)", "Richard Donat (Sheriff Jarvis)", "David Fox (David Willson)", "Andrew Gillies ()", "Linda Griffiths ()", "Manu Lauzon ()", "Gary Levert ()", "Jack Medley ()", "Christopher Newton ()", "David Petersen ()", "Booth Savage ()", "Cedric Smith ()", "R.
