Inside her mind comes five emotions, all with different perceptions of life.\r\n\r\nThere's Joy, who takes charge and her job is to keep Riley content, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust, and together, they work together (or try) to keep Riley from harming herself. They live together in the headquarters, or Riley's head, and they look after Riley's memories.\r\n\r\nAfter eleven years of enjoyment and content, Riley and her parents are forced to move out of Minnesota, away from her friends and hockey team, and moves to the city of San Francisco inside a desolate and cold house.\r\n\r\nBut things get even more anarchic when Joy and Sadness are sundered away from the rest of the gang, holding onto Riley's core memories that make Riley, well, Riley. One by one, the islands of personality fall apart as the rest of the gang back in headquarters watch in dismay and anguish. After all, Joy is not there to keep things under control.\r\n\r\nInside Out truly contemplates the hardships of growing up, but every problem comes to a heart-wrenching solution. The movie truly captivates this and continues the Pixar tradition of inspiration, family, and friendship in a little bit under two hours. Watch this, you must."}], "recommandations_id": [109445, 177572, 269149, 14160]}
