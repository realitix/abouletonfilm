The women filmmakers invited to direct for the seven sins were amongst the world's most renown: Helke Sander (Gluttony), Bette Gordon (Greed), Maxi Cohen (Anger), Chantal Akerman (Sloth), Valie Export (Lust), Laurence Gavron (Envy), and Ulrike Ottinger (Pride). Each filmmaker had the liberty of choosing a sin to interpret as they wished. The final film reflected this diversity, including traditional narrative fiction, experimental video, a musical, a radical documentary, and was delivered in multiple formats from 16, super 16, video and 35mm.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A23zrOytOJyiCOcSFlLaUikbwJo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
