She plays a British nurse named Lily, one of several survivors of a submarine attack during WW2. Lily and the others are rescued by Renato Baldini, commander of the Italian submarine which sank their ship. At first, there's no love lost between the Italian crew and their Allied captives. Gradually, Baldini's essential humanity is revealed, as is his love for the now-friendly Lily. What starts as a traditional wartime melodrama concludes in the spirit of peace on earth, goodwill towards men.  The director won two awards at the 1954 Berlin International Film Festival for the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wEEgireXqXQN85EtZ27OGXCbVyC.jpg", "actors": ["Oreste Biancoli ()", "Duilio Coletti ()", "Ennio De Concini ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
