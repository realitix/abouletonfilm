The director \u2013 herself a descendant of the Raverdy family (and expecting her first child) \u2013 goes in search of the stories behind this sealed-off part of the city. She moves in with her 91-year-old grandmother, who lives over the road. Piece by piece, she is able to reconstruct events leading up to the factory\u2019s closure, using old photos, advertising brochures, myths, language games, conversations with her grandmother and former female factory workers.  These memories unfold through different storylines. The factory\u2019s surroundings are explored through a poetic film style, and the history of the nunnery next to the factory is also revealed. This sensitive film is a reflection on the invisible and the forgotten, revolving around women and the changing body.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/79uaxiiDMvbpeKldIYlo0lnnkhW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
