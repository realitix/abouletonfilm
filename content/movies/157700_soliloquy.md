During the long journey, as the passengers mentally sort out their past &amp; their future, things happen in the present, by choice or by providence, that make their journey memorable\u2014the bus blows a tire, a song elicits tears, a butterfly causes commotion, a picture gets lost, someone's head is stoned, some hearts are broken, some mended.
