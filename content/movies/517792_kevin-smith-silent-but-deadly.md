Recorded on February 25, 2018 at the Alex Theater in Glendale, CA. Immediately after the show, Smith suffered a near-fatal heart attack, created by a 100% blockage of his LAD artery (aka \u201cthe Widow-Maker\u201d). Thankfully, he recovered - and he has this stand-up special to show for it, in which he riffs on marriage, fatherhood, friends and his work (or lack thereof).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u2GRZCcDD4W2zzCnP6PdHqgDHRo.jpg", "actors": ["Kevin Smith (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [104528, 25079, 57665, 130677], "youtube_key": "YgT-0uFZowQ"}
