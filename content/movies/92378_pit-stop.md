Willard bails him out of jail and offers him sponsorship as a race car driver. Bowman eventually accepts and becomes entranced by the tricky \"figure eight\" track Willard introduces him to. The king of the track is cocky and talented hot dogger Hawk Sidney (Hill regular Sid Haig in one of his most memorable and entertaining roles). Bowman and Sidney clash and Bowman sets his sights on knocking the latter of his perch while stealing his girl Jolene. This is just the beginning for the ruthless Bowman who will let nobody stand in his way and will attempt to destroy any man, and seduce any woman who crosses his path. Pretty soon he has his eyes on Ellen McLeod the wife of champion racer Ed McLeod who he befriends. Will he betray his friends and colleagues on the eve of The Big Race, or will he finally discover he has a conscience?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AjfrE5SlGvVUAWrak7R5scVqMu6.jpg", "actors": ["Brian Donlevy (Grant Willard)", "Richard Davalos (Rick Bowman)", "Beverly Washburn (Jolene)", "Ellen Burstyn (Ellen McLeod)", "Sid Haig (Hawk Sidney)", "George Washburn (Ed McLeod)", "Steve Pendleton (Luther)", "Robert Krist (Al)", "Ted Duncan (Sonny Simpson)", "Titus Moede (Moody)", "Ray Thiel (Roy)", "Don White (Ace)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [44439, 121901, 98413, 86777], "youtube_key": "moGU5qbqHiU"}
