Totally enjoyed it. The Sign Language was authentic. \r\n\r\nEven the way people interacted with the deaf, was for me,what I saw happening around me as a kid. \r\n\r\nA lot of people back in the 60's&70's here in Australia didn't know sign language was a Universal language. \r\n\r\nThey thought it was special sign's, families made-up for family members and interaction with a deaf person in the home... I hope a lot of people watch this movie. \r\n\r\nDeafness Is Not Disability..."}], "recommandations_id": []}
