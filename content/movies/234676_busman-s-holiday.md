His first mishap is to cause Pierre to mess up a cake that he's decorating, and Pierre tells him off. Since this job is finished, Woody gets on a bus with his automatic extension ladder, which keeps hitting the bus driver in the head every time that the bus stops. The driver finally throws Woody off, but Woody manages to get back on. The comedy with the ladder continues, finally involving a traffic cop, a motorcycle policeman and Pierre, as well as Woody and the driver. The story ends with all the participants, on the motorcycle, crashing into a brick wall.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mr6OKviHPKZqaX4eBfjp1AxP3h4.jpg", "actors": ["Grace Stafford (Woody (voice))", "Dal McKennon ((voices))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
