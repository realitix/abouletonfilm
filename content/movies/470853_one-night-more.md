{"tmdb_id": 470853, "title": "One Night More", "original_title": "One Night More", "slug_title": "one-night-more", "date": "2017-12-12", "genre": ["Drame / Romance"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "One Night More is a story of inner-city romance set in modern day London and how two people can meet and change each others lives to make them think differently about themselves and how change is an inevitable thing and also a constant. We explore the complex, albeit brief, relationship between Rose, an aspiring photographer, who meets Khrisna - a dancer. The film gives an unique, negative and perhaps melancholy perspective on love and attraction and how people at the end of the day just might not be attracted to one another, and must simply learn how to move on to the next thing, whatever that might entail. The story isn't trying to say anything big or new in regards to romance other than subverting 'the teenage ideal' of being in a relationship which sees no lasting potential just for the sake of fitting in.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eRpKfssfYHnB1ICIVQgib3eyshJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
