Its a fairly pleasant teen comedy about a school where the boys and girls are originally at odds and they play practical jokes on one another. Loletta Lee is in it, ironic that later on in her career she was not averse to taking her clothes off, but its more of an ensemble piece. I think if you're under twenty one you'll enjoy it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i831h5hi9hIpKtQX95DVXZEaJwR.jpg", "actors": ["Loletta Lee ()", "Nadia Chan ()", "Sam Christopher Chow ()", "Russell Wong ()", "Ku Feng ()", "Teddy Yip Wing-Cho ()", "Leung Lam Ling ()", "Chung Lin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
