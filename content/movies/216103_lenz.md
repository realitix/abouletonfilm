But he soon trades the Alsatian landscape for higher altitudes and more emotional territory: a reunion with his estranged wife Natalie and their son Noah in the Swiss Alps. Like his literary counterpart, the modern-day Lenz follows the Romantic motto: Genius writes its own rules. Against a background of kitsch global tourism - provided by the authentic Zermatt locations - Thomas Imbach's Lenz portrays an unconventional family and a man struggling between euphoria and desperation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9dACV8qPGwncov77hAKXH7voeWY.jpg", "actors": ["Noah Gsell (Noah)", "Barbara Heynen (Tanja)", "Barbara Terpoorten (Natalie)", "Milan Peschel (Lenz)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
