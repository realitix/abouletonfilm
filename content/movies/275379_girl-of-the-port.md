While seeking a way home she is befriended by a local man (legendary Olympic swimmer Duke Kahanamoku) who gets her a job working as a barmaid at \"The Bamboo Bar\". There she meets an alcoholic World War I veteran (Reginald Sharland) who is haunted by his wartime experiences and has an irrational fear of fire. Under her concerned care, he begins to recover and they fall in love. But then her jealous self-appointed boyfriend (Mitchell Lewis) forces the veteran to participate in a traditional Fijian fire-walking ritual.
