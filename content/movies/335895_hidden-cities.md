The city, as a living organism, reflecting social processes and interactions, economic relations, political conditions and private matters. In the city, human memories, desires and tragedies find expression in the form of designations and marks engraved in house walls and paving slabs. But what the city really is under this thick layer of signs, what it contains or conceals, is what we are researching in the HIDDEN CITIES project. The source material for the film are 9 sequential photo works created by Guszt\u00e1v H\u00e1mos between 1975 and 2010. Each of these 'city perceptions' depicts essential situations of urban experiences containing human and inhuman acts in a compact form. The cities in which the photo sequences have been made are Berlin, Budapest and New York \u2013 places with a traumatised past: Wars, dictatorships, terrorist catastrophes.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/64I0DAuveEj6iE1qgte8jENJaq0.jpg", "actors": ["Ulrich Matthes ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
