Highlights include an epic pole-vaulting match between West Germany and America, and the final marathon race through Tokyo's streets. Two athletes are highlighted: Ethiopian marathon runner Abebe Bikila, who receives his second gold medal, and runner Ahamed Isa from Chad, representing a country younger than he is.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sEw2E52QM3vTj7Pal3iQNguobXw.jpg", "actors": ["Abebe Bikila (Himself)", "Jack Douglas (English-Language Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [239428, 147312, 148068, 148118], "youtube_key": "WHt0eAdCCns"}
