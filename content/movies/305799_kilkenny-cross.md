Under mother's wing, Jordi spends all his time on the Internet. His only adventure is a ride on the back of his girlfriend's motorbike. One day, a coincidental but shocking discovery on the Net forces him to start searching for his identity, away from his familiar environment. It takes him to a confrontation with his biological father who was supposed dead, but appears to live in Ireland and does not immediately press his lost son in his arms. Kilkenny Cross is a coming-of-age drama, in which the Dutch urban water landscape contrasts with the green hills of Ireland and the impassiveness of modern means of communication with the longing for human intimacy. A chat session between mother and son leads to an emotional climax. In a cameo role, female novelist Manon Uphoff explains what true love means.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cH0tpATUQiKSYnrsCvHnU68wJyn.jpg", "actors": ["Sjoerd Dragtsma ()", "Mari\u00eblle Woltring ()", "Ariane Schluter ()", "Marcel Hensema ()", "Piet Kamerman ()", "Eoin McCarthy ()", "Sue Walsh ()", "Zoe Birchmore ()", "Cliodhna Hallissey ()", "Leo Hallissey ()", "Hedda Lornie ()", "Cox Habbema ()", "Manon Uphoff ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
