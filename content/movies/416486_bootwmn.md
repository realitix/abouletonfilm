When she is approached by a Canadian artist and a San Franciscan tattooer to create a gay themed cowboy boot, a story unravels of a unique collaboration that takes them to the heart of cowboy country in Northern Texas. BOOTWMN is a heart-warming, intimate and at times funny portrait of the queering of a traditional art form.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9D9yj9KhM5GOvt9zOWl9ubYxNoH.jpg", "actors": ["Deana McGuffin (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
