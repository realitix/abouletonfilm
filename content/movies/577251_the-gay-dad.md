Love blossoms with a Dutch man on his quest for liberation.  This short film was taken from a feature film shot in 2008 called 'Dutch Courage' -- the film has been successful on my channels, so I felt it warranted a shorter version, concentrating on the gay love story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zbmIG6Zfkaf6elcfVxzOT2zlqEQ.jpg", "actors": ["Dan Fry (Paul)", "Johan Venter (Karl)", "Lisanne Fry (Ashley)", "Olivia Fry (Olivia)", "Nathan Fry (Nathan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "YMiVavrjscQ"}
