She lives alone, loves reading fairy tales and hides in a magic fantasy world in order to survive living in the real one. She thinks she is a fairy who came on a mission and got caught in this world. She travels by bus every day. At the bus-stop, there is a \"web camera\" which records images and puts them into the Internet. Santiago is a scientist who works in an international research project to detect signs of extraterrestrial intelligence. He is a lonely man who lives with his dog and his computer. Rosal\u00eda finds she has some extra-sensory powers and thinks three young women she knows are fairies. They will remarkably influence her life. She also feels the need to meet her father, whom she has not seen since she was 8.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1dEC3YHAP2gaYBZWvoJlqfkT94g.jpg", "actors": ["H\u00e9ctor Alterio (Padre de Rosal\u00eda)", "Antonio Birabent (Santiago)", "M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n (Susana)", "Julieta Ortega (Rosal\u00eda)", "Ana Mar\u00eda Picchio (Madre de Rosal\u00eda)", "Francisco Rabal (Don Francisco)", "Guadalupe Subiela (Hada)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
