When his house burns, he moves in with his twin sister, Fanfan -- an impulsive, quixotic egoist -- and her husband, Charles, the Aluminum King. Charles becomes the focus of the film, as his wife and brother-in-law bewilder him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dErZ4ZGNsXvTjA1GTzdfQl2ZcJT.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Bohringer (charles)", "Anne Brochet (fanfan)", "Hippolyte Girardot (barjo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
