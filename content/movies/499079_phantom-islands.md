It follows a couple adrift and disoriented in the stunning landscape of Ireland\u2019s islands. Yet this deliberately melodramatic romance is constantly questioned by a provocative cinematic approach that ultimately results in a hypnotic and visceral inquiry into the very possibility of documentary objectivity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1KRXTwyTNjX7lVsex9DQpGuU3NN.jpg", "actors": ["Daniel Fawcett ()", "Clara Pais ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
