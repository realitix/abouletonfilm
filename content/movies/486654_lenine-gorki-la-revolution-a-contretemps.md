Through the voices of Lenin and Gorky, discover the two faces of the Revolution: the theory and the practice.  Let us return to this mixture of exaltation and nervousness that propelled the Revolution's actors. Retrace their steps by using their own words, their outlook.  This dual narrative will give a rich perspective: one abrupt, unpredictable, moving\u2013 will be Maxim Gorky. The other \u2013 as cold as history and tactics, the planning of the next move \u2013 will follow Vladimir Illyich Lenin.  Both the writer and the revolutionary are haunted by the failure of the last great European revolution, the Paris Commune, 1871. Through exclusive archives and beautiful animation, Stan Neumann will immerse us into the day by day events, from February to October 1917.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sT6K77vCr47mgTKdZhACoBbBEdl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
