Roger (the mountaineering expert) states that Martin (the sport climber) wouldn't survive a day on a 'real' climbing expedition, although he is considered to be the world's best sport climber (having just won an indoor 'world championship,' an event depicted in the opening scene). They plan to climb 'Cerro Torre,' in the Patagonia region of South America, near the Argentinian/Chilean border, one of the world's most difficult mountains, especially considering the extreme weather conditions common to the area.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/459MeLTQMF9hlNvaHbUuBPIo5I6.jpg", "actors": ["Donald Sutherland (Ivan)", "Brad Dourif (Fingerless)", "Vittorio Mezzogiorno (Roccia)", "Mathilda May (Katharina)", "Al Waxman (Stephen)", "Gunilla Karlzen (Carla)", "Chavela Vargas (Indianerin)", "Georg Marischka (Werbeagent)", "Volker Prechtel (Himalaja-Bezwinger)", "Hans Kammerlander (Bergsteiger)", "Lautaro Mur\u00faa (Estanciero)", "Amelie Fried (TV-Moderatorin)", "Werner Herzog (TV-Regisseur)", "Wolfgang M\u00fcller ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
