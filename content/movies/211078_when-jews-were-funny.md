Jews came to dominate the world of western\u2010society comedy on radio, stage and screen alike.Why did Jews dominate comedy in this period? And why did that domination end? Were Jews just funnier back then? And if so, did that extend to your average Jew on the street? In this 90 minute documentary acclaimed director Alan Zweig will examine these questions and many others in this exploration of 20th century humour, cultural decay, and a search for a missing heritage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3SGZ4FTcJuVgJcGfbG9PdCK3fZm.jpg", "actors": ["Shecky Greene ()", "Howie Mandel ()", "Shelley Berman ()", "Norm Crosby ()", "Jack Carter ()", "David Steinberg ()", "Andy Kindler (Himself)", "Elon Gold ()", "Gilbert Gottfried ()", "Bob Einstein ()", "Judy Gold ()", "Marc Maron (Himself)", "Eugene Mirman (Himself)", "David Brenner (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [545957, 304816, 473317, 441766], "youtube_key": "3Jb4AluDLN8"}
