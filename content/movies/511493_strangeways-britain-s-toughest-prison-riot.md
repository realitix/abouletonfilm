For the first time, these events are told through unparalleled access to the people at the heart of the riot - ex-inmates, prison officers and the governor himself - createing a compelling story of the struggle for power between the authorities and the hardcore prisoners who ultimately took their protest onto the prison roof. The stand-off that followed is documented until the final moments, when the siege was ended in a dramatic takedown in front of rolling news cameras.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Shaun Dooley (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
