Forming in 1969, Supertramp quickly rose in popularity and established themselves as one of the most popular of the crossover Art-Rock/mainstream bands. They became a staple on FM and had a string of huge selling singles and albums.  Their popularity began to fade in the 1980\u2032s as musical tastes changed with Art-Rock falling out of favor with New Wave. The band eventually went on extended hiatus and reformed later with personnel changes.  But there was a time in the mid-seventies where you couldn\u2019t turn on a radio without hearing at least one, if not several Supertramp songs in one sitting; all of which you knew by heart.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7wA8j07kt32Jnc5MJMfr8J5qH6x.jpg", "actors": ["Rick Davies (keyboards, vocals)", "John Helliwell (saxophone, vocals)", "Roger Hodgson (guitar, keyboards, vocals)", "Dougie Thomson (bass)", "Bob Siebenberg (drums)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
