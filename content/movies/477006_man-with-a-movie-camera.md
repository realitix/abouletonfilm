Through the use of mirrors, manipulations of focus, aperture and composition, film camera and filmmaker are progressively revealed, and the construction of illusion in film is broken down. The Man With A Movie Camera is one the purest examples of reflexive filmmaking in the early years of the LFMC.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/alle5SSes0nSxze22Y05EfcFWkv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
