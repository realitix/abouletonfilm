The con requires a native Albanian, so they designate Spiro, an impoverished and confused former political prisoner as chairman of the board. When Fiore returns to Italy to get government funds for the project, Spiro unexpectedly disappears and Gino sets out on a journey to find him. The search leads him to discover Spiro's tragic personal history and witness Albanian poverty firsthand.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pnoaKYhIhFxdtpdvtuPqQlwTG5X.jpg", "actors": ["Enrico Lo Verso (Gino)", "Michele Placido (Fiore)", "Piro Milkani (Selimi)", "Carmelo Di Mazzarelli (Spiro)", "Elida Janushi (Selimi's Cousin)", "Besim Kurti (Interrogator)", "Marjeta Ljarja (Factory's Manager)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [42143, 105721, 138093, 43596], "youtube_key": "3Fd6ZlgOFqs"}
