In a city where baseball culture is non-existent, these baseball players are a minority by choice. The experience teaches them to be free-thinkers in dealing with love, friendship and their own sexuality. It also enables them to find the will to live in the face of death and the strength to conquer losing in a spectatorless sport.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1CD3Y1eOBWR9Fhy1mZ0PpGJ5Ela.jpg", "actors": ["Yu Chung Leung (Chung - Pitcher)", "Ron Heung (Ron - Pitcher)", "John Tai (Coach Tai)", "Jason Tsang (Jason - Catcher)", "Jose Au (Jose - Captain)", "Yu Hong Lau (Hong - Second Baseman)", "Peter Mak (Peter - Right Outfielder)", "Herman Chan (Wah - Middle Outfielder)", "Jackie Chow (Jackie - Third Baseman)", "Julian Chiu (Julian - First Baseman)", "Kenneth Chiu (Kenneth - Pitcher)", "Lin Yuan (Meizi (as Gia Lin))", "Monie Tung (Kim)", "Wei-Sha Yan (Ping (as Wei Sha Yan))", "Sean Au (Sir Au)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
