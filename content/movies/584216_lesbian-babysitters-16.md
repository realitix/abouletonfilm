Unfortunately Karen is now headed to college, ending their love affair. Sam Potter, Alice's best friend, suggests she call Babysitter Dreams, the agency Sam found her sitter-with-benefits from. Alice is hesitant at first, but decides to call. Jill answers the phone and agrees to meet her, even if her girlfriend Olivia seems a little jealous. Alice and Jill hit it off immediately, in fact there seems to be some sexual chemistry, but when Alice tells her she needs a babysitter 24/7, Jill freaks out--craving the hot older woman and being in her home is quite the temptation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vkrxakCkDpCx9VSbox7FRzDc79h.jpg", "actors": ["Silvia Saige (Alice)", "Danni Rivers (Jill)", "Gianna Dior (Karen)", "Serene Siren (Sam Potter)", "Kenzie Reeves ()", "Ivy Jones (Olivia)", "Aidra Fox ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
