This film explores the process by which an apprentice bullfighter, Carmelo, became a matador, a term which is reserved only for those who are recognized as being fully qualified to serve as a central player in this ritualistic drama, la corrida, which is sometimes incorrectly described as being a \"sport.\" Various senior and retired bullfighters and their relatives recount their observations and experiences, and Carmelo re-enacts his coming-of-age as a bullfighter for the cameras. Those who are already convinced that la corrida is a celebration of the mystery of life and death may particularly appreciate this respectful documentary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u7NQRlgGHS0uKHSVwnyNPRUBoD3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
