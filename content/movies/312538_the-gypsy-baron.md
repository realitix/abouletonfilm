Next to \"Die Fledermaus\", DER ZIGEUNERBARON is Johann Strauss\u2019s most popular operetta. The libretto gave Strauss the chance to revel in such contrasting musical forms as the Cs\u00e1rd\u00e1s and the Viennese waltz. The style of the lied forms and ensembles is so original and finely balanced that the \"Gypsy Baron\" can truly be called a comic opera. Among the leading names of the stellar cast in this exuberant 1975 film of the operetta are Wolfgang Brendel, Ivan Rebroff, Janet Perry, Ellen Shade, Martha M\u00f6dl and, in the role that launched his career, Siegfried Jerusalem as S\u00e1ndor Barinkay.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xNPw3YpBMkAz9UyU9AdPAeQC07.jpg", "actors": ["Siegfried Jerusalem (S\u00e1ndor Barinkay)", "Wolfgang Brendel (Graf Hamonay)", "Hans Kraemmer (Conte Carnero)", "Ivan Rebroff (K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Zsup\u00e1n)", "Janet Perry (Arsena)", "Martha M\u00f6dl (Mirabella)", "Willi Brokmeier (Ottokar)", "Biserka Cvejic (Czipra)", "Ellen Shade (Saffi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
