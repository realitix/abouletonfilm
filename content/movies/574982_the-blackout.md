Contact between most towns on Earth has been severed. A small ring-like area in Eastern Europe still has electricity, and maybe even life is being reported from the Space. What military forces find outside the Ring is shocking. There are dead corpses everywhere: in stores, in cars, on roads, in hospitals and railway stations. Who or what is destroying all life on Earth? How long will the last outpost of mankind survive?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vJrop3uxLhEEWe9if8vucbWQG1m.jpg", "actors": ["Aleksey Chadov (Oleg)", "Pyotr Fyodorov (Yura)", "Svetlana Ivanova (Olya)", "Lukerya Ilyashenko (Alena)", "Kseniya Kutepova (Marina)", "Konstantin Lavronenko (Dolmatov, major)", "Philip Avdeev (Zhenya)", "Artem Markaryan (Sasha)", "Sergey Godin (Lavrin)", "Artyom Tkachenko (Id)", "Angelina Strechina (Katya)", "Alexandr Nedorezov (commando)", "Anastasiya Venkova ()", "Mikhail Grubov (Kopylov)", "Artyom Gaydukov (Senchuk)", "Maksim Emelyanov (Pavlov)", "Ilya Malanin (Kolya, fighter)", "Yuriy Borisov (Kostakin)", "Yelena Koreneva (Yura's mother)", "Ivan Ivashkin (Dima, Yuliya's husband)", "Georgy Topolaga (Mitskevitch, head doctor)", "Kirill Lopatkin (leading)", "Askar Ilyasov (receptionist)", "Oleg Boyko (Oleg's father)", "Yevgeni Syty (taxi driver)", "Arina Polonskaya (girl at the reception)", "Artem Eshkin (patrolman)", "Beso Gataev (Muslim preacher)", "Fedor Leonov (radio operator)", "Dmitry Yanyshevsky (captain Paver)", "Andrey Kurilov (Lt.
