The film is a nostalgic journey into the origins of the world's favourite game, and how legends are born and transcend generations. Perhaps no one before or since has personified the spirit of the working class culture that gave birth to the modern game. Shankly's passion for football was boundless to the point of obsession. This unique feature length documentary is an exploration of the determination and commitment to community that emerged from Britain's industrial heartlands and manifested itself in this unstoppable game: creating a love affair still etched in the hearts of the generations that followed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vbZg1WbnHaZXk03NepjlyvLRz5m.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Shankly (Himself (Archive Footage))", "Jamie Carragher (Himself)", "Steven Gerrard (Himself)", "Peter Hooton (Himself)", "Roger Hunt (Himself)", "Ian St. John (Himself)", "Kevin Keegan (Himself)", "Denis Law (Himself)", "Chris Lawler (Himself)", "Mark Lawrenson (Himself)", "John Toshack (Himself)", "Irvine Welsh (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
