The conversation turns toward the irony of self-starvation in a land of plenty and toward the international politics of food, where food aid is used as a negotiating tool. Confronting a serious issue, Rosler simultaneously sets into play the confessional form and the ghoulish staginess of talk show dramatics.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kLUSmwpiPLBbL6rp5SaQb2a5xbn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
