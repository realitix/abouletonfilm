The sisters showcase their music hall background to great effect, backed up by a number of idiosyncratic and ebullient characters. It's all very daft of course, none more so than with the blunderbuss finale played out at a theatre, and in truth the jokes wear thin after a while. But some comedy sequences do bring the laughs (sleepwalking on tacks, wonderful), ensuring this is not a waste of time for fans of this type of British film making. 5/10"}], "recommandations_id": []}
