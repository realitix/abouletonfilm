A Buddhist one. Old politicians have lost for once, and there is an outpouring of new hopes and energies. People around the newly elected mayor try to reshape the city observing ecological principles, discussing also new methods and values for the everyday political action. So, while the mayor fights truck drivers who are no longer allowed to drive through the city centre, some other people engage in different activities. A girl occupies a public building. A band plays on the beach. A man walks around the city as if he were lost. Another one returns to Messina after many years and tries to adjust to the new reality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tHazL6PGnUkK73DdlelNmi3sfZa.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
