The conflict became a religious war that resulted in a rebel Confucian army massacring hundreds of Christians in little more than a matter of days. The Uprising details the events leading up to the assault, focusing on the story of Yi Jae-su, the young man destined to become the leader of the rebel army.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8C0Z2vTNdmz7lMA6sDVvB4NAQnj.jpg", "actors": ["Lee Jung-jae (Lee Jae-su)", "Shim Eun-Ha ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
