{"tmdb_id": 485074, "title": "Oscar Arias: Without a Shot Fired", "original_title": "Oscar Arias: Without a Shot Fired", "slug_title": "oscar-arias-without-a-shot-fired", "date": "2017-06-18", "genre": ["Documentaire / Histoire"], "score": "6.0/10", "synopsis": "This is the story of a tiny country that made a decision to do something that no other country had ever done -- it decided to abolish its army and declare peace to the world. And this is the story of a young boy who grew up in that country, and how he ended up challenging -- and sometimes even convincing -- the greatest powers in the world to follow Costa Rica's example. \"Oscar Arias: Without a Shot Fired\" is a Don Quixote-like saga with great historical touchstones -- Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, Cold War politics and Communism, Central American War and Peace. It follows a slight, academic, and most unlikely hero over the course of more than fifty years, as he travels the world in a quest to stop the spread of the weapons of war. In the end, it is a story about the triumph of reason, of the sparrow triumphing over the eagle, and how the impossible dream can sometimes come true.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/68JSF0eQx1V8NVzkqroe7vrKrer.jpg", "actors": ["Oscar Arias (Himself)", "Maria Pretiz (Narrator)", "Tom Brokaw (Himself)", "Mikhail Gorbachev (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "e50vTqdRtco"}
