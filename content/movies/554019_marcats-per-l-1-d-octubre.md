What weight will it have on October 1 over the years? Will it be another day of a long process or will it have a separate chapter in the history of the country? These are some of the questions raised by the report \"Marked by October 1\", made by Gen\u00eds Cormand and Sara Segarra with an image of David Bou.  \"In La R\u00e0pita, we still have to understand what happened to us,\" one of the witnesses tells. A few minutes after 9 in the morning, 10 Vans arrived from the Civil Guard. There were 84 wounded. The \"30 Minutes\" has talked with neighbors, has reconstructed the moments that lived there, with a great deal of tension and violence, and reflected their reflections. A year later, they are still looking for an explanation.  The report includes, in addition to Rapita, in 4 other towns also marked by October 1. Five extreme situations explained by the neighbors who lived in the first person.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6Y9AJZUR454IJYf2GbJ5LFQ2MhQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "cdSFcaoQ0TA"}
