Most people don\u2019t know much about him. Most people know he was the father of Herut movement, a revisionist. And who really knows what revisionism really means. A few people know that he translated Allan Poe\u2019s Annabel Lee; even fewer read his historical novel, Samson. The Raven tries to fathom Jabotinsky\u2019s deceptive character.
