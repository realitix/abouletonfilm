She plays the spoiled-brat daughter of a pudding manufacturer who has been entered into the town's mayoral race by some of the local businessmen. They have chosen him because they think he is easy to manipulate. As a sales gimmick, the pudding magnate advertises that his product contains the highly nutritious \"Vitamin Z.\" He suddenly begins selling pudding like crazy and soon his political campaign is well-funded.
