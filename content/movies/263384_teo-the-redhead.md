After Santiago and his family arrive at his grandfather's farm, the elderly gentleman dies but not before telling his grandson a secret. On the one hand, Santiago is the heir to his grandfather's farm, and on the other, he may just have a special relationship to Teo (Alvaro de Luna), his grandfather's foreman. The little boy has a few playmates in his cousins who live on the farm with their parents, and he follows his idol Teo around with a child's admiration for his strength and unique personality. But when tragedy steps into the picture, Santiago's faith in Teo is put to the test.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iGUEh2lNY0bw4bgrD2KBgG5Rvrs.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
