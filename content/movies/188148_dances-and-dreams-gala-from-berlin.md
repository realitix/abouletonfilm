This 2011 concert, Dances and Dreams, has a theme of dances (two Dvorak Slavonic Dances, Stravinksy\u2019s Firebird Suite, Grieg\u2019s Symphonic Dance, Richard Strauss\u2019s Dance of the Seven Veils, and Brahms\u2019 Hungarian Dance No. 1) and dreams (Ravel\u2019s Alborado del Gracisoso and the famous Grieg Piano Concerto in A minor). This generous mix of romantic and impressionistic music shows off the magnificent Berlin ensemble at its best.  It is also great to see star pianist Evgeny Kissin at the keyboards.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rKkOOPJalYcIOXEWdcwJRc2Wtum.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
