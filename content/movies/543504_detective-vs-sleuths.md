The police, believing this a challenge to their crime-solving abilities, assign their own super sleuth, Wang Zhenfeng, along with retired \"super sleuth\" Uncle Xiangyun, to analyze long-dormant cold cases and find the killers before they're killed. A succession of successfully executed Super Sleuth-style murders leads Wang to doubt Uncle Xiangyun's true identity. Meanwhile, the three super sleuths engage in a battle of wits before the next execution takes place.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kvJmuz3EXs9mFJSvlm7kmrIEzll.jpg", "actors": ["Lau Ching Wan ()", "Charlene Choi ()", "Raymond Lam ()", "Carman Lee ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
