Although most aspiring comedians build their careers on the road, Jesus juggles his responsibilities at home in Long Beach with open mics and auditions in the Los Angeles area, often driving more than two hours each way every day. As the pressure of his budding career mounts, the family receives more devastating news: Jesus\u2019 father, Antonio, is diagnosed with stage 2 colon cancer.  An only child, Jesus becomes his parents\u2019 sole caregiver. Transforming adversity into comedy, he uses his life experience as material for his routine. He continues to reach for his dream while taking over his father\u2019s landscaping business to keep the family afloat. When his set catches the eye of producers at The Late Late Show with James Corden, Jesus may have scored the big break he\u2019s been banking on.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1NTvWXEpMblSHXiBy77WawNcSS5.jpg", "actors": ["Jesus Trejo (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
