As the story goes, pigs once lived very clean lives in houses, always picking up after themselves. Despite their cleanliness, they are rejected by others because they are ugly. Junior falls in the mud one day and is washed off by his frantic mother. She discovers that the mud takes away Junior's blemishes.
