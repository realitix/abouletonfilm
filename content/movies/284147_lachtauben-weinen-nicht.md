Among the workers are, for instance, young Rolf, whom everybody just calls \"Lachtaube\" and who always comes through for his co-workers, or the likable Hubert, who works as a simple smelter again after being dismissed as the head of the steel mill. Then, there is also the stubborn Manfred, who should have become a brigadier long ago because of his experience and his competence, but this privilege is refused to him because Manfred is not a party member. Ironically, it is Manfred who hears by accident about the plans of the mill to close down the old Martin furnaces \u2013 and to lay off the smelters. When the other men learn about the plans they enter the barricades for their jobs and force the plant\u2032s management to face the workers\u2032 demands and criticism.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/djZ7hqa5q5RYOw62MzgFEB71UQF.jpg", "actors": ["Gertrud Adam (Frau Krampe)", "Kive Antonow (Musiker)", "Christian Balhaus (Programmierer)", "G\u00fcnter Junghans (Dr. Ing.
