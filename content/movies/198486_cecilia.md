(Since the Spanish conquistadors killed off the Indian population in Cuba not long after they took over the island, there are no mestizos, or those of mixed-Indian blood in Cuba as in other Caribbean nations.) At any rate, the drama about the life and loves of Cecilia (Daisy Granados) takes place against the backdrop of graphically violent mistreatment of slaves and the rumors of a slave rebellion after the Cubans hear of slaves turning against their captors in Haiti.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aPIkJ8BTSKmaFBx90ANNmtraVaq.jpg", "actors": ["Daisy Granados (Cecilia)", "Imanol Arias (Leonardo)", "Raquel Revuelta (Madre de Leonardo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
