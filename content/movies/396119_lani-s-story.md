It is a moving and intimate portrait of a young Aboriginal woman's journey from victim to victor, from a broken and violent relationship to discovering the redemptive power of love. Lani's Story also explores the impact of inter-generational violence within a family and community and how the courage of one person can transform the lives of others.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Mark Owen-Taylor (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
