Then it's on to famous buildings and monuments, a look at female fishmongers who ply neighborhoods with baskets of fish on their heads, a survey of two nearby resort areas, watching a town's annual running of the bulls, and a visit to a bullfight, where the bulls are not killed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bxpMGe6jVrjlftBA2PXwYsHm9mi.jpg", "actors": ["James A.
