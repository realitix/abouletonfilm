A film student from Beijing and avid Johnnie To fan, Ferris Lin boldly approached To with a proposal to document the master director for his graduation thesis. To agreed immediately and Lin's camera closely followed him for over two years, capturing the man behind the movies and the myths. The result is Boundless, a candid profile of one of Hong Kong's greatest directors and a heartfelt love letter to Hong Kong cinema.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zPHKFeyKQn5R9zDNr8oQ46cXyr4.jpg", "actors": ["Johnnie To (Himself)", "Andy Lau (Himself)", "Lau Ching Wan (Himself)", "Louis Koo (Himself)", "Sammi Cheng (Herself)", "Sylvia Chang (Herself)", "Simon Yam (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
