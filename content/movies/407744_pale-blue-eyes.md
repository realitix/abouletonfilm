Kaganof merely projected the old 1992 16mm footage onto a screen and recorded it with a digital camera in 2002.  For some reason, he opted to not use a tripod, so the camera constantly moves around throughout the short.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
