Born into a family that supports the nationalist Kuomintang, Zhang eventually became a leftist and joined the Communist Party. But his family\u2019s background eventually catches up with him, and in a series of bureaucratic measures, he is labelled as a Rightist, leading to a slew of irrational yet life-affecting consequences.  His story is told through an exhilarating hybrid of forms, blending documentary-styled interviews and spectral theatrical displays within an ever-mutating studio-space. Hypnagogic in its imagery and ironic in attitude, Mr. Zhang Believes is a tour-de-force treatise of a man caught within dogmatic political maneuverings, which it critiques indirectly with creative and stoic fervour.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yuwc1w0zyprWEEg4X6y7J1AM9dP.jpg", "actors": ["Yifan Cai ()", "Xiao'ou Ma ()", "Jimmy Zhang ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
