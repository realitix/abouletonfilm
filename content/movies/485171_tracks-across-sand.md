Driven from their lands, forced into a life of destitution, and denied the right even to speak their own languages, the \u2021Khomani San fight for their heritage. Culled from over 130 hours of video recorded between 1996 and 2010, Tracks presents a unique record of the \u2021Khomani San, bringing together the story of Africa's first Bushman claim, from preparation through to ten years after the claim was granted. Seen through the eyes and told in the words of the \u2021Khomani San themselves, this film chronicles the struggle for indigenous rights by a people who are defying a history that has attempted and failed to make them disappear.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
