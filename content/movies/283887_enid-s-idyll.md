As Enid, the protagonist, is seen in a vast array of scenes from deep forests to castle keeps. Her champion is sometimes with her, sometimes away fighting archetypal foes. She dies and, through the magic of Gustav Mahler's resurrection symphony, lives again. Jordan explores themes of love, death and resurrection.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pJmqMFdkBvGTXDolwm7c47Opofk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
