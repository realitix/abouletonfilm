Pushed out of sight and sent to the coast of West Africa these computers end up in waste grounds such as Agbogbloshie in Accra, Ghana. On arrival the e-waste is recuperated by young men, who break and burn the plastic casings in order to extract the precious metals contained within. Eventually the metals are sold, melted and reformed into new objects to be sold \u2013 it is a strange system of recycling, a kind of reverse neocolonial mining, whereby the African is searching for mineral resources in the materials of Europe. Through showing these heavy processes, the video highlights the importance of dispelling the capitalist myth of the immateriality of new technology to reveal the mineral weight with which the Cloud is grounded to its earthly origins.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wPiMdiqsmy9RnFp6RpUaNVfw2e6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
