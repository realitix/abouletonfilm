Squirrels rely not just on memory but also on an enhanced sense of smell to locate their stashes of nuts under the snow. A particular species of woodpecker carves a deep, roomy hole in a dense white pine for a nest, feasting on the ants it somehow knows are inside. And a coniferous tree native only to this region has devised an ingenious way of self-defense. The question is not how cold is cold, but how to exist in spite of it all.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
