When an ancient jade carving that looks astonishing like a phallus passes from hand to hand and then on to more intimate places in an unrelenting magical drive to return to its rightful owner and mistress, it creates a havoc of desire and lust in its wake... fiery love in some, greed and hate in others.  The warm, green statue bewitchingly speaks to your mind enticing the participants in the movie and audience alike to turn on to the other action.  Luscious Linda Wong, Hustler cover girl, is the rightful owner and mistress of this magic aphrodisiac. Desiree West, the busty bombshell who plays Linda's niece, recovers the object for Linda in an action sequence which leads to a delicious wet shower scene. Going from a loving couple, to their chambermaid and woman chauffeur, and on the hoods and their molls who are retained to recover the magic object, the green Lingham instructs all the meaing of China Lust.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gEv2OtqzWB2JT3l8wwsTiK5EqW4.jpg", "actors": ["Linda Wong (Rightful Owner)", "Jeff Lyle (Buyer of Green Box)", "Veronica Taylor (Buyer of Green Box)", "Laura Bourbon (Alice the Maid)", "Melba Bruce (Second Thief)", "Peter Johns (Thief with a Beard)", "Vicky Lindsay (Second Thief's Friend)", "Ken Scudder (Cab Driver)", "Desiree West (Girl with Cab Driver)", "Herbert Wong (Bearded Thief's Partner)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
