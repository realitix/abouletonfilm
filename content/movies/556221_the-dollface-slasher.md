The Dollface Slasher just doesn't.\r\n\r\nAt points, it comes off as a parody of standard slasher tropes, and the overall amateurishness of the final product would play right into that. Then the film takes a confusing turn towards seriousness and loses the playful comedy aspect seen in the first couple of minutes, which is a bit of a shame. \r\n\r\nEven without the questionable line it crosses between serious and parody, The Dollface Slasher does nothing memorable or unique. It's not a thought-provoking twist on the slasher subgenre displayed in just under eleven minutes (without credits). It's simply a confused slasher film that takes a no-budget approach to the slashing parts of the movie. \r\n\r\nOn the plus side, this would make a wonderful appetizer for a group of friends before settling in to watch Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street, or some other top-tier slasher."}], "recommandations_id": []}
