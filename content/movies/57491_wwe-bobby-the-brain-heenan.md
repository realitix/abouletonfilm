He guided members of the infamous Heenan Family to great heights in both the AWA and WWE, even occasionally stepping into the ring himself. He also further cemented his place in pro wrestling lore by becoming one of the great color commentators of all time, completely earning his 2004 induction into the WWE Hall of Fame. Now, for the first time ever, fans can relive the Brain s magnificent career in Bobby The Brain Heenan, a 2-disc DVD that tells the life story of Heenan as well as collects his most famous matches, interviews, and moments.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hKX0AN4cbsAo1tRpHXDrqVofdDq.jpg", "actors": ["Bobby Heenan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
