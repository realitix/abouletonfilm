The concept for 'Stripped,' a studio/live hybrid album with stripped-down instrumentation, was conceived as a kind of response to 'MTV Unplugged' while the band was on their big-scale 1994/1995 world tour in support of 'Voodoo Lounge.' A total of four stripped-down concerts were held at small venues in Amsterdam, Paris and London, and recorded for the album 'Stripped.' The concert that was released under the title \"Live from Paris 1995\" on DVD and SD Blu-ray as part of the 2016 'Totally Stripped' deluxe boxed set took place on July 3, 1995 at the Paris Olympia, a venue with a capacity of about 2000. Three songs from this intimate concert were included on the original 'Stripped' album, namely \"Shine a Light,\" \"Let It Bleed\" and \"Angie.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jSUFw2vV7Vz3c5GsXGR2to5bg2n.jpg", "actors": ["Mick Jagger (Himself (Vocals, Guitar))", "Keith Richards (Himself (Guitar, Vocals))", "Ronnie Wood (Himself (Guitar, Backing Vocals))", "Charlie Watts (Himself (Drums))", "Darryl Jones (Himself (Bass))", "Lisa Fischer (Herself (Backing Vocals))", "Bernard Fowler (Himself (Backing Vocals))", "Chuck Leavell (Himself (Keyboards))", "Andy Snitzer (Himself (Saxophone))", "Kent Smith (Himself (Trumpet))", "Michael Davis (Himself (Trombone))", "Bobby Keys (Himself (Saxophone))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "7zajS4PJSms"}
