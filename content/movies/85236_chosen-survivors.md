There they learn that a nuclear holocaust is taking place and that they've been \"chosen\" by computer to survive in the shelter in order to continue the human race. The shelter is designed to allow the people to exist underground comfortably for years, but they are faced with a threat nobody could have predicted: a colony of thousands of bloodthirsty vampire bats finds a way into the shelter and launches a series of vicious attacks where they claim the humans one by one.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/shhEqihPGuU0zFdtIkQyojaO8RB.jpg", "actors": ["Jackie Cooper (Raymond Couzins)", "Alex Cord (Steven Mayes)", "Richard Jaeckel (Major Gordon Ellis)", "Bradford Dillman (Peter Macomber)", "Pedro Armend\u00e1riz Jr. (Luis Cabral)", "Diana Muldaur (Alana Fitzgerald)", "Lincoln Kilpatrick (Woody Russo)", "Gwenn Mitchell (Carrie Draper)", "Barbara Babcock (Dr. Lenore Chrisman)", "Cristina Moreno (Kristin Lerner)", "Nancy Rodman (Claire Farraday)", "Kelly Lange (Mary Louise Borden)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [135605, 355854, 27546, 111816], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
