A storm from hell brings mysterious strangers . . . who come with secrets. Emma is a struggling romance writer. David is a traumatized war veteran struggling with his past and sleeping in his van. They face an evil and terrifying menace as the strangers appear. Veronica arrives naked. Coby has blood on him. Then the Others come. Sex and murder, lust and deadly vengeance make this a night that the romance writer and her new friend will never forget . . . if they survive. Set in an antique house amidst the haunted saltwater marshes of Cape Cod, like the Sixth Sense, the film marries Hitchcock and the paranormal in a tightly plotted thriller.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rlsu7O66zjgo9XeWwdKAkVpKYpB.jpg", "actors": ["Alexandra Creteau (Veronica)", "Emma Gruttadauria (Emma)", "Joshua Koopman (David)", "Nick Apostolides (Killer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
