It was a secret map, guarded from the eyes of foreign spies, which was changed and reworked with the comings and goings of each expedition. Aided by scientific equipment to measure distance, the navigators dreamed up the representation of the expanses that they had covered. When at sea, they looked up to the heavens and gauged their path by the stars, hands drawing in space fictional lines that carved territories. Upon returning to shore, they took the map that had previously belonged to others as their own, erasing divisive lines and constructing new borders. The map that they followed has been lost over time, and what remains of it is a stolen copy, made from memory by one of the cartographers in order to outwit enemies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yW1ZDF5xRlqc2z3ZWb95RapNU9E.jpg", "actors": ["Ana Moreira ()", "Cavaleiros do Mar ()", "Dr. Miguel Ramalho ()", "Renato Cortes ()", "Jo\u00e3o Fernandes ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
