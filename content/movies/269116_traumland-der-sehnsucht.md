Aside from a tour of the scenic and historical wonders of the country, Mueller-Sehn spends a lot of time in Athens examining its famous attractions like the Acropolis. Perhaps over-long at its current running time, this docu introduction to Greece would certainly be ideal for anyone planning a first visit to the country.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iwAiFJgFqaPdz2UDGgMZefDd1o8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
