Determined to alter the present by changing the past, the pirates travel back to 1955 to construct the ultimate weapon: an Elvis Presley video-clone. Part sci-fi + rom com + biblical epic + action movie, this free-culture manifesto adopts the tactical responses of the parasite, feeding off the body of Hollywood and inhabiting its cinematic structures and codes. The unwitting all-star cast includes Elvis Presley, Charlton Heston, Monkey, Batman, Bette Davis, Jaws, Jesus, The Hulk, The Hoff and the Ghostbusters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4JM3FSjJ1fNij7eq4JeQ1B6pMnY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
