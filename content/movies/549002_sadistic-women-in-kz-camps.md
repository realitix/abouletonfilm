Young women from the BDM, Bund Deutscher M\u00e4del, or the NS-Frauenschaft. But also trained nurses. In 1945 many of them were brought to justice. Some were sentenced to death or pardoned by appropriate time in prison. But the majority of the women guards and supervisors were never caught. They disappeared in the post-chaos of World War 2.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/crzWSYQ9ktuhl5SDXTXftemqVzK.jpg", "actors": ["Ilse Koch ()", "Irma Grese ()", "Maria Mandl ()", "Herta Bothe ()", "Juana Bormann ()", "Elisabeth Volkenrath ()", "Alice Orlowski ()", "Hildegard Lachert ()", "Hermine Braunsteiner ()", "Ruth Closius-Neudeck ()", "Herta Oberhauser ()", "Herta Ehlert ()", "Ewa Paradies ()", "Gerda Steinhoff ()", "Greta B\u00f6sel ()", "Elisabeth Marschall ()", "Liselotte Meier ()", "Frieda Walter ()", "Magdalene Kessel ()", "Hildegard L\u00f6bauer ()", "Charlotte Pliquet ()", "Dorothea Binz ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
