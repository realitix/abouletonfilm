Andreas (Giorgos Dialegmenos) is an elderly man who finds himself caught in a wave of nostalgia about the home where he grew up with his mother. Andreas decides to travel to the Greek island where he and his mother lived in hopes of visiting his boyhood home, but he soon discovers that things have changed a great deal over the years; many familiar landmarks are gone, and no one on the island is terribly interested in helping him find his way. After much searching, Andreas thinks he's found the place where he grew up, only to discover the house is gone, and a group of refugees have set up camp on what used to be the family's property. Efimeri Poli was the first dramatic feature from director Giorgos Zafiris after helming a series of well-respected documentaries.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pgoBs6vPFb3SmuLivF74hEngpx1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
