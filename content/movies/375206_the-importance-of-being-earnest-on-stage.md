Directed by Adrian Noble, (Amadeus, The King\u2019s Speech, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang) Wilde\u2019s superb satire on Victorian manners is one of the funniest plays in the English language.  Two bachelor friends, the adorable dandy Algernon Moncrieff (Philip Cumbus \u2013 regular player at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe) and the utterly reliable John Worthing J.P., (Downton Abbey\u2019s Michael Benz) lead double lives to court the attentions of the exquisitely desirable Gwendolyn Fairfax (Emily Barber) and Cecily Cardew (Imogen Doel). The gallants must then grapple with the riotous consequences of their deceptions, and with the formidable Lady Bracknell.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bfANEHm3b0bNfKaMYek2TcrjppW.jpg", "actors": ["David Suchet (Lady Bracknell)", "Michael Benz (John (Jack) Worthing)", "Philip Cumbus (Algernon Moncrieff)", "Imogen Doel (Cecily Cardew)", "Michele Dotrice (Miss Prism)", "Brendan Hooper (Merriman)", "David Killick (Lane)", "Richard O'Callaghan (Reverend Canon Chasuble)", "Emily Barber (Gwendolen Fairfax)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
