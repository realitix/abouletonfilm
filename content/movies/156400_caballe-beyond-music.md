In locations throughout the world where Ms. Caball\u00e9 sang, we hear interviews with Ms. Caball\u00e9, her family, and by opera and music giants like Claudio Abbado, Jos\u00e9 Carreras, Giuseppe Di Stefano, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Ren\u00e9e Fleming, Dame Joan Sutherland, and Zubin Mehta, also appearing often in clips showing joint collaborations.
