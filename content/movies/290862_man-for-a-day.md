For the past thirty years, the main focus of this performance artist\u2019s work has been an exploration of the theoretical, artistic as well as the practical aspects of gender identity. Katarina Peters\u2019 documentary observes a Diane Torr workshop in Berlin in which a group of open-minded women come together to discover the secrets of masculinity. What makes a man a man and a woman a woman? Precisely when and where is gender identity formatted? How much is nature and how much nurture? Each of Torr\u2019s workshops represents an open-ended laboratory experiment in social behaviour in which the question is posed: is it possible to deliberately play out different roles and create a space in which to transgress both masculine and feminine characteristics?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j79LIgE4bUyFVZSZwsVnS5BBWm.jpg", "actors": ["Diane Torr (Diane Torr)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [290858, 133823], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
