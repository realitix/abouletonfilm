She destroys old correspondence, cleans her apartment by putting furniture in the street, and looks back on her life (as revealed via flashbacks and a film crew interviewing her daughters). Caroline's brief marriage to an Englishman gave her one daughter, successful businesswoman Rachel (Domini Blythe), and an affair with a rebel in the Congo resulted in her other daughter Myriam (Sheila Rose). Further memories rise to the surface when Caroline joins her long-time friend Maureen (France Castel) for a black-tie reception where their community work in Africa brings them an Order of Canada award.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aRHlxqNvkAyOrAhuJuLjnZPALNa.jpg", "actors": ["Annie Girardot ()", "France Castel ()", "Michel Ghorayeb ()", "Domini Blythe ()", "Widemir Normil ()", "Mireille Metellus ()", "Pascale Bussi\u00e8res ()", "Denise Bombardier ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
