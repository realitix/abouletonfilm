Biggi and Alfred are out of work and they live very modestly. The 14 and 17 year-old daughters Saskia and Denise should really go to school, but there are always reasons for them to stay at home. This gives rise to tension with Alfred. We accompany them during their conflict-ridden everyday lives and learn something about their dreams, fears and hopes. And how difficult it is to break out of a circle.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c5Ur2shgwSWwo0i4GymxspRK0uI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
