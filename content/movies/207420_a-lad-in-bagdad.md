The shady character who was playing the game before him covets the lamp, and tries to steal it. Egghead sees a poster: The sultan is having a contest for his daughter's hand in marriage. With his lamp, Egghead thinks he's a sure bet; he conjures up a magic carpet, and he's off. After a couple bad vaudeville acts, it's Egghead's turn, but in the meantime, the bad guy swapped the lamp for a coffeepot. Egghead is thrown out, then sees the bad guy using the lamp; Egghead breaks in, steals the lamp and the girl, and flies off. But she uses the lamp herself to conjure up a real hunk to replace the nerdy Egghead.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2dKOVd0qkHAFReSBpDL1yimCo15.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
