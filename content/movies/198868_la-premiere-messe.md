Directed by Lima Barreto, the tale is told in a series of flashbacks as the priest remembers how he was transformed as a child into a person willing to give his life in service of the church and his God. Barreto also scripted the story, which in the end, may be too filled with religious platitudes and preachy overtones to effectively convey its message.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uQpQyFugRz55bZ7zlcCBMCl9up9.jpg", "actors": ["Roberto Alrean ()", "Dion\u00edsio Azevedo ()", "Artur Barman ()", "Felipe Barreto ()", "Martin Binder ()", "Francisco Brasileiro ()", "Ricardo Campos ()", "M\u00facio Ferreira ()", "Galileu Garcia ()", "Vittorio Gobbis ()", "Jaime Gon\u00e7alves ()", "Luciano Gregory ()", "Henric\u00e3o ()", "Nieta Junqueira ()", "Ferreira Leite ()", "Cavalheiro Lima ()", "Jos\u00e9 Mariano Filho ()", "Oliver Nelson ()", "Joel Penteado ()", "Jacyra Sampaio ()", "Lima Barreto ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
