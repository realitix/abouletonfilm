It charts a vivid journey from the reconstruction in London of the sixteenth-century open-air playhouse to the establishment of a centre housing the theatre, a permanent exhibition and an unrivalled education programme.  The film explores a day in the life of this remarkable enterprise: behind-the-scenes preparations, rehearsals, backstage drama and performance extracts from a production of Romeo and Juliet, together with glimpses into Globe Education workshops and activities, the exhibition and tours.
