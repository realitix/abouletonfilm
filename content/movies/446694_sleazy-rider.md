An original X rating due to rampant nudity and sleaze kept this off of most rental shelves during the video revolution. All subsequent bootleg DVDs have been sourced from a very rare Dutch VHS release, which was the only known release of this film on home video.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3x7vEJbzfuaOuOVDG08NMsAbOsX.jpg", "actors": ["Jody Bishop (Fry)", "Roger Gentry (Sheriff Sam)", "Penny Boran (Barbie)", "Starlyn Simone (Biker Chick)", "Becky Sharpe (Anna)", "Sandra Henderson (Sam's Wife)", "George Peters (Mustached Biker)", "Wes Bishop (Roger (uncredited))", "Dan Haggerty (Hag (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
