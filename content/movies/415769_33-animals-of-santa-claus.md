It's not the most obvious choice for a way of life, acknowledges the woman in question: \"I tell you, it's like living in a madhouse.\" This cheerful menagerie Santa Claus has created keeps her fully occupied. The animals need to be fed, brushed, kept amused and taken out for exercise in groups.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
