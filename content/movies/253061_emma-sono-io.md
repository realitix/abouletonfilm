Emma is a town councilwoman whose husband (Marco Giallini) has taken a mistress because he dislikes her repressed behavior. Her demeanor changes radically when the town pharmacist runs out of Emma's daily dose of depressants. Emma has a disorder in which she is naturally outgoing and upbeat. Her marriage gets rocky as she expresses her true self. The town responds poorly to a woman being so brazen, but Emma's best friend (Elda Alvigini) is inspired by Emma to make a major life change.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hUPxqrZuLYoaqiMfnSo311WoTex.jpg", "actors": ["Cecilia Dazzi (Emma)", "Elda Alvigini (Marta)", "Marco Giallini (Roberto)", "Pierfrancesco Favino (Carlo)", "Nicola Siri (Daniele)", "Nicola Siri (Emilio)", "Luigi Diberti (Marcello)", "Claudia Coli (Elisa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
