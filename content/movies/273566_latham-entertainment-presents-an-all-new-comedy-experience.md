Latin Kings of Comedy was hard to understand because I don't speak Spanish. I looked forward to Latham Entertainment Presents and expected another masterpiece. I was somewhat dissatisfied. Sommore was not funny at all. In fact, she sounded drunk. Ricky Smiley could have been funnier. There were times throughout his segment where I thought he might be booed. D.L. Hughley was nowhere near as funny as he was on Kings of Comedy. However, the only people in my opinion who stole the show were J. Anthony Brown, Bruce Bruce, and Earthquake. Earthquake was definitely my favorite out of the entire cast. A decent move, but not one I suggest you buy. Rent it for a dollar first and see how you like it."}], "recommandations_id": []}
