UP cameramen filmed the Big Boys over a three-year period, which Pentrex re-released in 1992. It ran for a total of just 23 minutes, leaving hours of unused footage that was set aside for many years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tzD9UQ3zXZ2B1F3dZIgawuuspUc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
