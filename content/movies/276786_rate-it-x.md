Men only are interviewed by the two filmmakers in a witty montage of free-wheeling encounters. Pornographers, corporate executives, a funeral parlor director and Santa Claus are among those who reveal more than they intended. A surprisingly candid view of men's feelings towards women 15 years after the birth of the women's movement.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iAZCgrqKqr0tsBREEqvm0bE1zCP.jpg", "actors": ["Lucy Winer (Herself / Interviewer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
