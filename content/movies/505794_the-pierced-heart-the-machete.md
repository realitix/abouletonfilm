The first is for \u00c8zili Danto, goddess of love, art and passion; worshipers from all over the world descend on the southwestern town of Ville-Bonheur to bathe in the sacred waterfall where Dant\u00f2 resides. The second pilgrimage is for Dant\u00f2s' husband Ogoun, god of war, iron and healing. It takes place at the end of July in the northern town of Plaine du Nord, where practitioners bathe in a mud pool and make flamboyant sacrifices. This beautifully shot film offers disorienting yet illuminating glimpses of the contradictory and complementary aspects of these two lwa, the electrifying rites that honor them, and the intense music that accompanies these ecstatic and bloody ceremonies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s6meZOQAl5F0VddpKNRi4ICerNM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
