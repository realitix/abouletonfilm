Directed by Greg Hunt, with Jake Burton on board as executive producer, this was never going to be a short film to sleep through. Even though the stylophone [from the teaser] doesn't feature in the full edit, Dylan does play guitar, wears a white shirt while he shreds and even makes friends with a donkey! Oh, and the skating is silly beaut. Love him or hate him, it's impossible to deny that the boy's got talent.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/21Ovo5uM5ud625YDotKHNfrq1gG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
