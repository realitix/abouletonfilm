Tragedy struck 25 years later, and the city labeled her a killer, traded her and forgot her.  The new elephant, Bunny, lived up to her gentle name. She lived for decades as a lone elephant until a sanctuary offered her a new home and elephant companions. The city was divided as it debated what was best for Bunny.  The movie \u201cTwo Elephants\u201d reaches into history to reveal the universal lessons from the last century about elephants in captivity and to remind us that every elephant has a story.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
