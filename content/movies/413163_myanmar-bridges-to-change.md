All told, the climbers traveled over 270 miles on foot through some of the harshest terrain on the planet. As a country that is just recently awaking from over 50 years of military rule and relative isolation, they were offered a glimpse into a culture unaffected by the rapid pace of globalization throughout the rest of world. This film is not just a recounting of a mountaineering expedition, its a film about a country that is on the brink of rapid change, and what this might entail for the future Myanmar and its people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hIQVPYCzYMiWwoLPxuufJyf8BIk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
