When Rebekah's marriage falls apart in real time, we realize her dream is not a whim. It is a burning passion for music that comes with its share of real world sacrifices. Thanks to the support from her newfound rock n roll legend friends such as Steven Adler (Guns n Roses) and Rikki Rocket (Poison), Starr re-commits to her mission and accomplishes what she set out to do. Her contagious optimism acts as the film's through line, hoping to inspire anyone feeling trapped by their circumstances.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ieJqpMdUL9yiokNytmXacNz5NPZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
