Ahmet, you need to eat more. Double meals.\u201d Like other boys their age, Baran, Ahmet and their classmates wrestle with the desire for recognition, with homesickness and with their target weights. Most of all though, they wrestle with, and against, one another. They are comrades and competitors, united by one and the same dream: Olympic gold! In their wrestling academy in the Turkish province of Amasya, which is well known for this traditional form of combat sport, they undergo strength and endurance training, they learn lifts and throws, they urge each other on and they console one another. Always responding to the boys\u2019 needs, the trainers give the boys tough love, sometimes fatherly, sometimes strict and disciplinary. The film\u2019s intimate documental camera bears close witness to the fine line between friendship and competition, victory and the lesson of how to lose.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bmyp1zpBVOCQhVkF9YLZd9GIG6P.jpg", "actors": ["Muhammed Ceylan ()", "Beytullah Onur ()", "Harun K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 ()", "Baran Kendirlio\u011flu ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
