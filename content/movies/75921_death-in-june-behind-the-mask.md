This would be the first time Douglas would take part in this type of interview project. Its flow replicates a meandering day-long conversation that was held between Douglas P. and Darryl Hell at Mindswerve Studio, New York City, in 2004. Their many life experiences in 1970's, 1980's punk rock, made for a fertile ground. Hell's vision for the project was to give Douglas a chance to fully articulate himself without the boundaries of the traditional interview format. The result is a roller coaster ride through Douglas' life from childhood into the future.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nVL1l0cxpUJLHgu5u6y9aTFfYo6.jpg", "actors": ["Douglas Pierce ()", "John Murphy ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
