Until she married Hamed, Zinat worked in a public health clinic in a small Iranian town. She loved her job and was deeply committed to helping the community. After the wedding, her in-laws and family force her to quit and become a full-time housewife. She does try, but her former patients keep returning for help. Zinat cannot, in good conscience, turn them away so she helps them. She then suffers the wrath of her mother-in-law, but even after the irate in-law locks Zinat in the house, the plucky young woman still continues to help people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lGhI2HIlpVDllhRV1PWk3wqslCU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
