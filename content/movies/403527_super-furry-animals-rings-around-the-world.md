Featuring everything from Status Quo-style boogie-rockers to technofied drill &amp; bass meltdowns. Added to this they make rock &amp; roll history by releasing an album and DVD simultaneously. The DVD holds twelve specially commissioned film shorts rendered in dizzying surround sound. This is an immaculately conceived pop masterpiece.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aAgsqvUEusKdeu9lCo3FSKaVMbD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
