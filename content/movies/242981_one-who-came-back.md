A former LA police officer, Kritzman was under heavy sedation due to the severity of his leg injury, which was initially operated on at the 8055 MASH unit. Unaware of what would happen to him and what his long term prognosis was and would be, he, along with many of his fellow wounded, was transferred from hospital to hospital, each a little better equipped to deal with his injury.
