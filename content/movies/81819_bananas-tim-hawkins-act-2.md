From being the best home-school principal, to an 8-track cassette lover through and through, Tim explores the insanity of our technology crazed world. Tim also explains the difficulty of eating well in our fast-food culture- especially when you have a thing for doughnut glaze. With a bunch of great new material, Act 2 of Bananas Featuring Tim Hawkins is more than just stand up comedy. It's a variety show featuring interviews of the not-so-serious kind, as well as some hilarious unscripted moments caught on tape. Best of all, it's good clean fun for the entire family!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hAvTSya4ESrc0lpIrV8weeGRrMu.jpg", "actors": ["Tim Hawkins (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
