As Patrice Bart's 1999 production shows, it is always beautiful to look at, lending itself to the Christmas season where it has a permanent place in the schedules of the major dance companies. And Hoffmann's tale of the troubled child who must go on a wonderful (and occasionally terrifying) journey of discovery has a universal and timeless appeal.  Bart's production for the Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin builds on Petipa's original choreography and develops the context of the child Marie's (Nadja Saidakova) anxiety into a strong narrative. The godfather Drosselmayer (Oliver Matz) is initially a sinister figure, forcing her to confront past events before leading her into the glittering land of the Sugar Plum Fairy. Here, all expectations are exceeded.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s3sle50UjVFU8l9KXxzmcWo6KLB.jpg", "actors": ["Nadja Saidakova ()", "Olivier Matz ()", "Vladimir Malakhov ()", "B\u00e9atrice Knop ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
