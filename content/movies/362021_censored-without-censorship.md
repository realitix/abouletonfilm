The film tells a great \u201cthriller\u201d story of the ideological madness which characterised the totalitarian psychology having left multiple consequences felt up to our very days. It stresses similarities between totalitarian regimes defending their taboos on the example of the persecution of the most important Yugoslav film authors. Those film authors have, however, made world careers and inspired many later authors. The film is the beginning of a debt pay-off to the most significant Yugoslav film authors.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8sZM2Y0ab7nTaFd5U8BXod0EU5f.jpg", "actors": ["Du\u0161an Makavejev (Himself)", "Lazar Stojanovi\u0107 (Himself)", "Zelimir Zilnik (Himself)", "\u017divojin Pavlovi\u0107 (Himself (voice))", "Aleksandar Petrovi\u0107 (Himself (voice))", "Mladomir 'Puri\u0161a' \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 (Himself)", "Gordan Mihi\u0107 (Himself)", "Radoslav Zelenovi\u0107 (Himself)", "Karpo A\u0107imovi\u0107-Godina (Himself)", "Tomislav Gotovac (Himself)", "Slobodan \u0160ijan (Himself)", "Bahrudin 'Bato' \u010cengi\u0107 (Himself)", "Borislav An\u0111eli\u0107 (Himself)", "Dejan Kosanovi\u0107 (Himself)", "Sne\u017eana Pavlovi\u0107 (Himself)", "Bo\u0161ko Ru\u0111in\u010danin (Himself)", "Josip Broz Tito (Himself (archive footage))", "Dragoljub Vojnov (Himself)", "Branko Vu\u010di\u0107evi\u0107 (Himself)", "Vladan \u017divkovi\u0107 (Himself)", "Dimitrije Vojnov (Himself)", "Zdravko Randi\u0107 (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
