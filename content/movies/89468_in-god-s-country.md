Young women ignored by the police and protected by \"freedom of religion\" are trapped in polygamous communities scattered throughout North America. Judith Joseph is one of them. Despite being raised under the watchful eyes of \"God's Keepers\" and knowing no other life, Judith realises she cannot watch her sixteen year old daughter succumb to the same fate she was born into.

Alone, on the \"outside\", Judith is ill equipped to handle the challenges facing her, but she's determined to build a life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5t0h4WQ72cbQwrwjDgSTnA54OMo.jpg", "actors": ["Kelly Rowan (Judith Leavitt)", "Richard Burgi (Josiah Leavitt)", "Martha MacIsaac (Charlotte)", "Hannah Lochner (Alice)", "Peter Outerbridge (Officer Wayne)", "Lynda Boyd (Louise)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "4ACkSAo6LtE"}
