It was presented by Lugz and took place on December 9, 2001 at the San Diego Sports Arena in San Diego, California.  The main feature of the event was a three-match tournament to unify the WWF Championship and the unbranded former WCW Championship into what became known as the Undisputed Championship. Stone Cold Steve Austin competed against kurt Angle in the first match for the WWF Championship. Chris Jericho then competed against the Rock for the World Championship. The winners of those two matches then fought for the Undisputed Championship title.  In the undercard, The Hardcore Championship was defended by Rob Van Dam against The Undertaker, Edge defended the Intercontinental Championship against William Regal, Big Show and Kane challenged The Dudley Boyz for the Tag team Championship belts, and Trish Stratus fought Jacqueline for the Women's Championship.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dGglxjlFRhL9rbsoIvTFuGg6l2Z.jpg", "actors": ["Steve Austin (Stone Cold Steve Austin)", "Kurt Angle (Himself)", "Chris Jericho (Chris Jericho)", "Dwayne Johnson (The Rock)", "Mark William Calaway (The Undertaker)", "Rob Van Dam (Himself)", "Jeffrey Nero Hardy (Himself)", "Matt Hardy (Himself)", "Amy Dumas (Lita)", "Adam Copeland (Edge)", "Darren Matthews (William Regal)", "Trish Stratus (Herself)", "Jacqueline Moore (Herself)", "Paul Wight (The Big Show)", "Glenn Thomas Jacobs (Kane)", "Mark LoMonaco (Bubba Ray Dudley)", "Devon Hughes (D-Von Dudley)", "Stacy Keibler (Herself)", "Scott Ronald Garland (Scotty 2 Hotty)", "Matt Bloom (Albert)", "William Jason Reso (Christian)", "Andrew Martin (Test)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ON62NOUz87E"}
