It became a symbol of the new times touted by the Nazi regime.  The title (literally \"morning-red\") is the German term for the reddish coloring of the east sky about a half hour before the sunrise.  On patrol Captain Liers and his submarine crew sink an important British ship, but while returning to harbour, they're lured into a trap by a British vessel disguised as a neutral Danish one. They sink it after it attacks them without warning, but  while they prepare to rescue survivors, a British destroyer sinks the sub.  On the sea bed 60 feet down, with all but the bridge flooded, the 10 surviving crew have only 8 rescue devices. Liers orders the crew to use them, but they disobey - either all escape or nobody does.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f7rRrmIq2JqPT7YKK0unT33ApZ7.jpg", "actors": ["Rudolf Forster (Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Liers,)", "Fritz Genschow (Oberleutnant Fredericks)", "Paul Westermeier (Bordfunker Jaul)", "Camilla Spira (Grete Jaul)", "Gerhard Bienert (Steuermann B\u00f6hm)", "Adele Sandrock (Mutter Liers)", "Hans Leibelt (B\u00fcrgermeister)", "Eduard von Winterstein (Hauptmann Kolch)", "Franz Nicklisch (Petermann)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [61460, 218257], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
