It's a story told through a largely forgotten film archive that movingly documents the final years of coal's heyday from the 1940s to the 1980s. One priceless piece of footage features a ballet performance by tutu-wearing colliers. Featuring contributions from those who worked underground, those who lived in the pit villages, those who filmed them at work and at play and those - like Billy Elliot writer Lee Hall - who have been inspired by what made coalfield culture so unique.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ttn2dSvwSr1GMZyRpn1sAnaKhhC.jpg", "actors": ["Christopher Eccleston ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
