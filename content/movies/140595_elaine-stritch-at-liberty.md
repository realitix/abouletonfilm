Sinatra at Carnegie Hall. Streisand at the Garden. Stritch on Broadway. Legendary performances come along so rarely.  Elaine Stritch at Liberty is an autobiographical one-woman show written by Elaine Stritch and John Lahr, which is composed of anecdotes from Stritch's life and showtunes.  The show consists of spoken monologues from Stritch following her life and career, interspersed with showtunes and pop standards which compliment her stories. Many of these songs had been previously sung by Stritch in major productions, such as \"The Ladies Who Lunch\" from Company and \"Civilization\" from Angel in the Wings which she originated on Broadway. Her experiences and relationship with show business are focal points, but she also explores more intimate, personal themes like her alcoholism and romantic relationships.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9uoucM9yfmAYICtNMRHYxCVoWCO.jpg", "actors": ["Elaine Stritch (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "3Q-pgK5eFwg"}
