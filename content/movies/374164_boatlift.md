When the twin towers fell, hundreds of thousands of people ran to the water's edge. They soon realized that Manhattan is, indeed, an island. And that they were trapped. Within moments, an armada of every vessel that could get to the city's seawall spontaneously organized. Dashing into the teeth of danger, hundreds of boats pulled together and, without any formal planning, military or otherwise, they pulled off an ad-hoc sea evacuation that became the largest in history. Their story of courage and resolve reminds us of the powerful spirit that rose among us, on that fateful day. Narrated by Tom Hanks. Directed by Eddie Rosenstein.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cOisFeyE0FGwsjy1XKLAn7RxukD.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Hanks (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
