In addition to the visual clues, which are clips of a party, an Asian country, a European city, table games, winter, and bullfighting, there are montages of street scenes and spinning objects. A simple cartoon character, Mr. Rebus, walks the audience through the clues, and title cards encourage the participation of the theatergoers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lmHHV3Ea5LLyhsceEiAHpG4HRtt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
