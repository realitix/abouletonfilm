Anthony Steffen co-writes the screenplay with director Sergio Garrone and he also takes the lead role of the enigmatic stranger moving about the townsfolk like some grubby phantom. There's a splendid Gothic tint to proceedings, with crosses featuring prominently as Garrone and cinematographer Gino Santini dally with shadows and murky lighting techniques to enhance the other worldly pulse beat that the narrative calls for. Characterisations are pretty thin on the ground, though, while the action is only adequately staged. But genre fans are well served by the Spag Western staples that bring about sadism, wry social commentary and that old devil, Mr. Dry Black Humour.\r\n\r\nNever dull because Garrone keeps it brisk, and Steffen plays it rightly restrained as Django, this Bastardo passes muster for genre fans without ever actually being essential viewing. 6.5/10"}], "recommandations_id": [129851, 73832, 40347, 61738], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
