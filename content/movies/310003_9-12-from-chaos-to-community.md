They brought in supplies, set up relief stations, and for ten months fed and cared for the recovery workers. Many deep and unexpected - even unlikely - relationships developed out of this. Using cinema verite footage, interviews and archival photographs, we follow several characters through a series of events reuniting them with each other after the closing of the site. Through their stories we present a portrait of the city within a city that was Ground Zero, and examine how an extremely diverse group of people transcended politics and culture in an effort to heal their city and themselves. 9/12: From Chaos to Community - a 60-minute character-driven documentary - is a vibrant, moving, sometimes funny, sometimes painful portrayal of hope and healing in the wake of disaster.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
