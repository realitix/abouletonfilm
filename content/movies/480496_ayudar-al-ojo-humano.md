Harassed by this spell, his great-great grandson, also a priest, is forced to flee from the town to the capital and from there to a cathedral submerged in the depths of the ocean. Black magicians, delinquents, insects, archons and even Satan himself will be some of the sinister characters he will have to face in order to succeed in his evangelizing adventure.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vJQmmWl7gG9jUJ1eg98Wiumhpfj.jpg", "actors": ["Juli\u00e1n G\u00e9nisson ()", "Lorena Iglesias ()", "Aaron Rux ()", "Beatriz Lobo ()", "Andr\u00e9s Gertr\u00fadix ()", "Nacho Vigalondo ()", "Velasco Broca ()", "Ram\u00f3n Churruca ()", "Chema Garc\u00eda Ibarra ()", "Carmen Escalante ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
