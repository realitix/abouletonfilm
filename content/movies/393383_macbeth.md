Shirley Verrett stars as the murderous and ambitious Lady Macbeth, Leo Nucci co-stars as her similarly ambitious but slightly more scrupulous husband, who has the good grace to feel some horror at his deeds before he does them. The entire opera was filmed inside a Belgian castle, and some of the smaller parts are obviously lip-synched to pre-recorded music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nNSz0n0WsP9ptTxrC2EXRRslw00.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
