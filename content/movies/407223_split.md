He spends his time meditating and doing 3D puzzles while Jessie spends hers collecting dolphin figures, dancing to \u201cSummer Love\u201d and smoking weed. Wanting to make a documentary on Scott\u2019s social reintegration, social worker Anick moves in to their house for a few days. While the shoot starts off smoothly, with several funny and touching interviews of Scott and Jessie, things quickly derail. Anick seems more interested in Jessie than Scott. The documentary\u2019s subjectivity is quickly replaced by a growing attraction between Anick and Jessie. The continuous presence of the filmmaker in the enclosed space, coupled with the exasperation Scott feels at being constantly recorded, is causing the pressure to escalate. Scott could lose it at any time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zay5SFS1NwyGPNO2Qi1b8j9uDjC.jpg", "actors": ["Whitney Lafleur ()", "Marjolaine Beauchamp ()", "Ronald Cyr ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
