He holds a successful job and is living out a dream experiment of functioning one year without running water or electricity. Not surprisingly, he also displays a passionate opposition to cars and driving. One evening, after being forced to borrow his boss\u2019 car in order to collect a colleague for a work function, Michele\u2019s life takes an unexpected turn.\r In the blinding rain Michele hits something he cannot identify. After leaving a note on a parked car he believes he damaged, he continues down the road only to come across a dead body a few miles down which he later discovers belongs to one of Siena\u2019s most important luminaries. Michele immediately calls the police, but in doing so, he unwittingly brings intense suspicion on himself as his uncertainty raises more questions than he has answers for.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cd23KqW9oNqSqctJumgeNDX8gBk.jpg", "actors": ["Luigi Lo Cascio (Michele)", "Luigi Maria Burruano (Avv.
