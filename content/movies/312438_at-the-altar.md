Most persistent among her suitors was Grigo, a coarse Sicilian, whose advances were odiously repulsive. The arrival at the boarding house from the old country of Giuseppe Cassella, the violinist, filled the void in her yearning heart. Romantic, poetic and a talented musician, Giuseppe was indeed a desirable husband for Minnie.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n0cGjOsuGziBc9ROmQlfmk4w9VF.jpg", "actors": ["Marion Leonard (Minnie, the Daughter)", "David Miles (Father)", "Charles Inslee (Grigo, the Suitor)", "Barry O'Moore (Giuseppe Cassella)", "Anita Hendrie (Mother)", "Dorothy West (Minnie's Friend / Dinner Guest)", "Linda Arvidson ()", "Clara T.
