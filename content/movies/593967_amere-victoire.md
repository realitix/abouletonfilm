A few weeks after this terrible accident, and while there is no time to lose, Yannick Jadot negotiates at the European Parliament for better security for the most nuclearized continent on the planet, whereas the majority political parties try to rationalize this extraordinary event. At the same time, the young deputy is an advisor to Eva Joly, the candidate for the presidential primary in the Ecologist party.
