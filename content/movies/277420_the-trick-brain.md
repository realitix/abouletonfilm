This was the residence of Andr\u00e9 Breton, the mastermind of surrealism, who surrounded himself with an impressive collection of modern, Western art and ethnographic objects from Oceania and North America. The collection was sold and divided up in 2003 at a controversial auction. 'The Trick Brain' is a delirious montage and a trip back in time to Breton's private art collection, where Atkins has been scouring the archives and come up with a possessing interior film of the place that once was, complete with surrealistic paintings, scores of Indian figures and hundreds of other displayed rarities. The film's soundtrack is provided by an observant narrator, who reveals to us that the objects shown are not necessarily what they claim to be - but instead are catalysts for some kind of wonderful linguistic virus which reveals the real identity of things.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yknAksMLOo250SbphqDklXFjm7w.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
