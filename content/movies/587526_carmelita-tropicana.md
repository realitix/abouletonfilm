After a performance one night, she's mugged by a knife-wielding thief. The next day, in a clash with anti-abortion protesters in front of a woman's health clinic, Carmelita is arrested, along with her lively friend Orchida and her sort-of up-tight and wannabe-wealthy sister, Sophia. They're placed in a cell with another woman, who turns out to be last night's mugger, a down-and-out young woman named Cordelia (Dee). Relationships between each pair of women and among the four of them go through changes as the afternoon passes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mDGwEeaAu0lzK8kl6NQlws3Ng6d.jpg", "actors": ["Alina Troyano (Carmelita Tropicana)", "Sophia Ramos (Sophia)", "John Lanzillotto (Righty)", "Anne Iobst (Dee)", "Livia Daza-Paris (Orchidia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
