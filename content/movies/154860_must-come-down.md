They're both very much lost in their individual quarter-life crises. Ashley quit his job to travel in search of clarity. He ventures to his childhood home with plans of breaking-and-entering for the nostalgic rush. Along the way he meets Holly, who, after a short-lived relationship with her restaurant manager, also finds herself jobless and aimless. The film chronicles Holly and Ashley's brief, odd, hysterical commiseration as grown-up children stumbling through life's final bout of growing pains.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9hu5vRDxliavR1y5pfAKaCQxZlQ.jpg", "actors": ["Ashly Burch (Holly)", "David Fetzer (Ashley)", "Liberty Cordova (Susan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "h6RZlProf8I"}
