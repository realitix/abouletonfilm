The trouble begins when crotchety postman Andre begins complaining about his young neighbor Marianna's propensity for playing loud music every time she entertains a lover. To get back at him, Marianna begins sending him anonymous love letters. The old man is intrigued by the mysterious letters and hires a cheap detective to find their author. The detective is convinced the perpetrator is Teresita, a veteran hooker who joins in on the scheme to earn a little extra cash. Andre's friend and colleague tries to warn Andre that it is all a game, but his friend is in love and will not listen. Meanwhile, Marianna attempts to woo Luis Felipe, a hard, unfeeling tabloid journalist who has her take grisly pictures of murder victims for him. Both Marianna and Andre are destined to meet an unpleasant fate at the story's end.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5cnmJrJMz5hsh1gw94akWR5snY7.jpg", "actors": ["Luis Felipe Tovar ()", "Tiar\u00e9 Scanda ()", "Fernando Torre Laphame ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [30323, 30322, 41307], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
