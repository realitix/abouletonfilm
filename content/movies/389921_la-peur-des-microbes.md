He becomes terror-stricken, and runs straight to a chemist's where upon his inquiry they sell him a liquid which must be administered through an atomizer. This he takes, and sets forth on a crusade against influenza. He only succeeds, however, in making a universal nuisance of himself, spraying the contents of his bottle on everybody whom he meets. He comes to grief in one instance when one of his victims dumps him into a filled water trough, giving him a thorough ducking. In another place he tries his charity upon a workman who is emerging from a manhole, and receives a beating. All of his victims join in a chase, and upon capturing him turn him over to the police; even there he tries his atomizer, but the mob sets upon him and avenges themselves summarily.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
