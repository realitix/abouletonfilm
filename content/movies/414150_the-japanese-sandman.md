Told through Burroughs' wickedly incisive voice, cocaine snorting in Panama and post-prom hand-jobs in 1931 St. Louis become a meditation on loss, memory and the human condition.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qaIDVcO8wfKIlbzkpSO3fee8RuC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
