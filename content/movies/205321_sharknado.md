I thought before seeing this movie that it was a spoof movie of all those shark movies like JAWS, Deep blue sea etc., but it turned out to be a serious shark movie with some parts in the movie that are not believable. Tornado itself can be made as a tragic movie so imagine we top it up with sharks and call it Sharknado. \r\nIt\u2019s an ok movie for a one time watch but don\u2019t expect to be all wowed by it \r\nNotable Acting\r\nCassandra Scerbo famous for her movie such as Bring it on\r\nIan Ziering \r\nMy Rating 6/10"}, {"pseudo": "Gimly", "content": "It's kind of odd that _Sharknado_ is the movie that brought ridiculous Creature Feature B-movies into the public awareness. Especially seeing as it's been going on since like... The '50s, minimum... Wish it had have been a better movie that hit the zeitgeist though...\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing.
