The process starts by loosely sketching a variety of shapes with warm grey markers on vellum and mylar. After he completes and scans eight of these quick sketches, you can follow along as he overlays the sketches to create unique color palettes and compositions within Adobe Photoshop\u00ae. To complete the process, Scott then paints digitally on nine of the compositions. During the execution of the quick environment paintings Scott discusses lighting strategies, composition, atmospheric and linear perspective.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
