In between are interviews with the cast of the films and some clips, by far the most from \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", but a few glimpses of Rohan riders (from \"The Two Towers\") are provided. Also, there are interviews with a range of the filmmakers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/knCJvfbr4LWNZBkTDlwRdM28PuR.jpg", "actors": ["John Rhys-Davies (Himself - Narrator (voice))", "Peter Jackson (Himself)", "Elijah Wood (Himself)", "Ian McKellen (Himself)", "Orlando Bloom (Himself)", "Sean Astin (Himself)", "Billy Boyd (Himself)", "Philippa Boyens (Herself)", "Winston Churchill (Himself (archive footage))", "Adolf Hitler (Himself (archive footage))", "John Howe (Himself)", "Alan Lee (Himself)", "Dominic Monaghan (Himself)", "Christopher Lee (Himself)", "Richard Taylor (Himself)", "Cate Blanchett (Herself)", "Liv Tyler (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
