Hans Keller visited the same countries and places in order to make a film about the life and work of this man, who could only live in hotels. Keller creates a beautiful synthesis between Europe as Roth knew it and the present-day Europe. In the loving look at the different locations, the continuity of past and present reveals itself. Intermittently, tableaux in a copied 'Bioskoptheater' show scenes from the author's life. Finally, a film script which was once rejected by Hollywood yet comes alive.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jmwCz3uvqx65GHDVIIrCoYIj0N3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
