The girls are teens and, since they live there, are kind of tickled to see a male teacher. They don't particularly lust after him, but they kind of crush on him. The title of the film refers to a baby that Chen minded as a favor in a doctor's office, only to find the mother left him with Chen. Chen has to take care of the baby and, inevitably, has to bring him to school and hide him, as he lives there also.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AdGi0BmqT9OfuVWAsU8yLFSYw39.jpg", "actors": ["Li Ching (Helen Li)", "Peter Chen Ho (Chen Zi Feng)", "Ou-Yang Sha-Fei (Head Mistress)", "Chin Wei-Ling (Margaret)", "Yi Mei (Nancy Luo)", "Ding Sai (Lin Shu Zhen)", "Sam Wan (Teacher Zhou)", "Ku Wen-Chung (Helen's dad)", "Man Man (Farmer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
