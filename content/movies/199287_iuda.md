He follows them and steals their money, only to be caught red-handed. Nevertheless, the Teacher forgives him. What is more, He invites the thief to become one of His followers and offers him a position as the group\u2019s treasurer. Shocked by Christ\u2019s unexpected offer, Judas decides to join the apostles, if only to figure out what is going on. He gradually starts to comprehend Christ\u2019s message, but feels that the apostles are blindly following their teacher.

But when he fails to make them understand, he realizes that Christ\u2019s teachings may sink into oblivion without benefiting humanity. His solution is to betray Christ. \u201cBy killing a man, have I not saved a God?\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xqF1d1QHHxbm41ftNorp1kSnQmN.jpg", "actors": ["Aleksei Shevchenkov (Judas)", "Sergey Frolov (\u0424\u043e\u043c\u0430)", "Ivan Dobronravov (\u041c\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0439)", "Aleksey Bochenin (\u0418\u043e\u0430\u043d)", "Olga Aksyonova (\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430)", "\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043c \u0414\u0443\u0433\u0438\u0448\u043e\u0432 (\u0412\u0430\u0440\u0444\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0439)", "Olga Stashkevich (\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f \u041c\u0430\u0433\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430)", "Andrey Barilo (\u0418\u0438\u0441\u0443\u0441)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "NSWJAucGN7c"}
