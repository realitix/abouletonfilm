In 2015, 8 staff were assaulted every hour \u2013 a new record high.  At The Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham \u2013 one of the UK\u2019s biggest hospitals \u2013 they think they have the answer. Here a private security force of 46 uniformed guards, and a sophisticated CCTV system, keep staff and patients safe.  A colourful mixture of characters ranging from ex-soldiers, to bouncers, to former elite sportsmen, it\u2019s the security team\u2019s job to keep the hospital running smoothly.
