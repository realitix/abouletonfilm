His vocabulary is consistently challenging\u2014even for some adults\u2014and his ideas are insanely intricate and fun, and yet he retains that aura of silliness and ridiculousness so vital to kids' programming. The show's Retroville setting is a perfectly vivid and colorful environment for Jimmy to thrive in. Characters interacting with Jimmy include his pie-obsessed dad Hugh Neutron, his loving 50s-TV-show-patterned mom Judy, and his friends\u2014Far Side-inspired Carl, Ultralord-obsessed Sheen, and Kirsten Dunst-soundalike Cindy. It's a fun ensemble whose actions appeal to the kiddie set but whose words often aim for the parents. You get fart jokes combined with quotes from Shakespeare and words like \"exacerbate.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ywbl9DPHi9erY4Y5n4m6yYEWPaq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
