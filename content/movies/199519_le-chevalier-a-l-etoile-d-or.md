The title character, played by future director Sergei Bondarchuk (and billed for obscure reasons as Semyon Bondarchuk), is an ex-soldier who returns home to the Kuban region, there to take up life as a farmer. Instead, he galvanizes the local citizenry into participating in a massive construction project, which will result in a new power station and canal. Thus does Raisman offer an prime example of Russian collectivism while making it seem as though it had sprung from individual initiative. Dream of a Cossack is based on a popular novel by S. Babayefsky.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mwRCMV2w1S7JPrgdig8XvTIwjZR.jpg", "actors": ["Sergey Bondarchuk ()", "Anatoli Chemodurov ()", "\u041a\u0438\u0440\u0430 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0430 ()", "Boris Chirkov ()", "Nikolai Komissarov ()", "Vladimir Ratomsky ()", "Nikolai Gritsenko ()", "Ivan Pereverzev ()", "Tamara Nosova ()", "Stepan Kayukov ()", "Sergei Troitsky ()", "Aleksandra Panova (Marfa Lubasheva)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
