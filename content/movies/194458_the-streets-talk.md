Until now there hasn\u2019t been a de\ufb01nitive \ufb01lm made in Barcelona which explores the history, motivation, politics and the numerous characters involved in the street art scene.  The story follows the real life experience of Katrine Knauer as she develops her interest in Barcelona urban art through her photoblogging website called Mapping Barcelona Public Art and an 2012 street art exhibition featuring some of her discovered artists.  The \ufb01lm was originally considered as a 5 minute documentary to complement the Las Calles Hablan exhibition but we later realised that a much bigger, more intriguing story needed to be told. The deeper we delved into this vibrant subculture the more we discovered and the more we got hooked.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7pWQ8YYYCH6dUYBFQGVpdXutd18.jpg", "actors": ["Zosen ()", "Mina Hamada (Herself)", "Kenor ()", "Kram ()", "El Xupet Negre ()", "Debens ()", "Fert ()", "Dase ()", "Ogoch ()", "Kafre ()", "Aleix Gordo ()", "Meibol ()", "Eledu ()", "C215 ()", "H101 ()", "Miss Van ()", "Btoy ()", "El Arte Es Basura ()", "Konair ()", "Gola ()", "Vinz ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
