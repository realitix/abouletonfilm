Girl loves man who loves woman, woman isn't worth his time. Into that mix throw in a hopeless drunk with a good heart and weak stomach, a bartender who's more desperate than his customers and Steven Tyler as a shameless bad boy looking for a good time and fast woman. Powerful, gritty, hard hitting and raw.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qtyEI1LtqKVUdX0BDQj10SBFjWB.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Sorvino ()", "Steven Tyler ()", "Nick Chinlund ()", "Debi Mazar ()", "Richard Edson ()", "Kim Dickens ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
