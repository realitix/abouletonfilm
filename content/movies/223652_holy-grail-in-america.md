The stone allegedly dates back to 1362. Initially thought to be a hoax, new evidence suggests the find could be real, and a clue that the Knights Templar discovered America 100 years before Columbus, perhaps bringing with them history's greatest treasure... the Holy Grail. Follow the clues as experts use erosion studies on the rune stone and match symbols in Templar ruins all over Europe to support this theory. Stones with similar markings have been found on islands across the Atlantic Ocean, and in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Is it possible the Knights Templar, long thought to have been massacred, escaped on an incredible journey and were leaving clues to the whereabouts of the stone?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/693DsQ2ezoTcsCm0wmMpgjbF3NE.jpg", "actors": ["James Lurie (Narrator (voice))", "Alice Kehoe (Herself - Anthropologist)", "Anatoly Liberman (Himself - Philologist, University of Minnesota)", "Darwin Ohman (Himself - Grandson of Olof Ohman)", "Scott Wolter (Himself - Forensic Geologist & Author, The Hooked X)", "Tom Trow (Himself - Past Archaeologist, Minnesota Historical Society)", "Florian Ledermann (Himself - Past President, Runestone Museum)", "James Scherz (Himself - Prehistoric Cartographer)", "Simon Brighton (Himself - Author, In Search of the Knights Templar)", "Erling Haagensen (Himself - Author, The Templar's Secret Island)", "Steven Sora (Himself - Author, The Lost Colony of the Templars)", "Kelly Krause (Herself - Archaeologist)", "Ashley Cowie (Himself - Author, The Rosslyn Templar)", "Evan Pritchard (Himself - Director, Center for Algonquin Culture)", "Niven Sinclair (Himself - Clan Sinclair Patriarch)", "Carmen Legge (Herself - President, New Ross Historical Society)", "David Brody (Himself - Chair, Westford Knight Committee)", "Virginia Kimball (Herself - Westford Knight Historian)", "Bruce Bourque (Himself - Archaeologist, Maine State Museum)", "Roslyn Strong (Herself - New England Antiquities Research Association)", "Richard Lynch (Himself - New England Antiquities Research Association)", "William Penhallow (Himself - Astronomer & Physicist)", "Suzanne Carlson (Herself - Architect & President of NEARA)", "Akram Elias (Himself - Freemasonic Grand Master)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "IorksKF6B6g"}
