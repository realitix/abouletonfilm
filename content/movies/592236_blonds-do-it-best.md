Watch as three buddies go out hiking in the woods and decide that getting off in the great outdoors beats bird watching and camp fires. Back at the cabin things get going as Lance is sunning himself by the lake. When a young boater, Ty Cashe, runs out of gas, Lance is willing to fill up more than Ty's empty can. Just as Ty is taking off, Mark Sheldon returns from jet skiing. While he is warming his buns by the fire, Lance joins him as Mark drops to his knees to warm up the rest. Leo Ford joins in and Mark has more than he can handle trying to take care of these two hot studs from both ends at the same time. Shawn Michaels shows up to find Leo lying down by the fireplace and decides to hop on the situation. Ty suddenly knocks at the door and ends up getting refilled by two attendants this time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nkLSfaGHmU63Z6Lyq0KxmiVXGpZ.jpg", "actors": ["Lance ()", "Leo Ford ()", "Shawn Michaels ()", "Ty Cashe ()", "Mark Sheldon ()", "Chris Thompson ()", "Brandon Wilde ()", "John Tracy ()", "Christopher James ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
