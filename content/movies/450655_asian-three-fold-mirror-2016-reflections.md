Brillante Mendoza grapples with the issue of loss of national identity and home, with a story set in the Obihiro area of Hokkaido and Manila in the Philippines. Isao Yukisada directs a story in Malaysia where the Japanese army was once stationed but is now home to many Japanese retirees living out their remaining years. An elderly man has parted from his family in Japan to live alone in Penang, but when a new helper comes to the house, he slowly opens his mind and an unexpected bond forms between the two. Finally director Sotho Kulikar conveys a beautiful but heart-rending love story between a Japanese man and Cambodian woman that unfolds across past and present against the backdrop of Cambodia's civil war.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7OSvxUWaHFNgmYPHPcRo0JHmJIL.jpg", "actors": ["Lou Veloso ()", "Masahiko Tsugawa ()", "Sharifah Amani ()", "Masatoshi Nagase ()", "Masaya Kato ()", "Chumvan Sodhachivy ()", "Osamu Shigematsu ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
