Four women are looking for happiness and a good man in the divided city. Their destinies are loosely connected through one person: the West Berlin dandy and womanizer, Conny. Released at the peak of East German cultural and political dogmatism, the film was heavily critiqued, especially by female party leaders who objected that its portrayal of the four women did not represent the qualities that characterized women in the new society. Now considered as a richly contradictory work, Destinies of Women represents an encore production by the Dudow/Eisler/Brecht creative team that also made Kuhle Wampe in 1932.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fXFxnlaMrOo5ranXXbp9WCvAL9D.jpg", "actors": ["Sonja Sutter (Renate Ludwig)", "Lotte Loebinger (Hertha Scholz)", "Anneliese Book (Barbara Berg)", "Ursula Burg (Isa von Trautwald)", "K\u00e4te Alving (Chefin von Anni)", "Angela Brunner (Ursula Krenz)", "Maly Delschaft (Frau Ludwig)", "Susanne D\u00fcllmann (Anni Neumann)", "Hermann Mayer-Falkow ()", "Gertrud Meyen (Betty Vogt)", "Charlotte K\u00fcter (Gertrud Neumann)", "Lola Chlud (Staatsanw\u00e4ltin)", "Annelise Matschulat (Frau Becker)", "Karla Runkehl (Freundin)", "Katrin Dahl (Freundin)", "Kaete Scharf (Leiterin des Modesalons)", "Hanna Rieger (Stra\u00dfenm\u00e4dchen)", "Hanns Groth (Conny Lohm\u00fcller)", "Albert Doerner (Dr.Gebhardt)", "Agnes Kraus ()", "Maria Rouvel ()", "Edith Volkmann ()", "Hans Joachim Sch\u00f6lermann (Verteidiger)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
