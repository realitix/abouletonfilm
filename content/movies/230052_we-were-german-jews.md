This is a personal account of their dramatic flight, building a new life in the United States, and coming to terms with the Holocaust. \"We Were German Jews\" grapples with the torment of living with the legacy of the Holocaust. The film chronicles Herbert and Lotte Strauss' return visit to Germany. They were not trying to assuage any sense of guilt over having survived; they wanted to confront the past by going back to where they had lived before the onslaught that claimed most of their relatives. This understated, very personal story adds significantly to the body of evidence that explores human behavior in the face of genocide and insists that we remember the past and learn from it.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Herbert Strauss (Himself)", "Lotte Strauss (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
