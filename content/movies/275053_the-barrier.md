The characters in the movie lack the ability to communicate with each other and therefore, fail to understand their own emotions. Hence, they fail to maintain healthy relationships with each other because of the lack of love amongst them. This failure is attributed to the surrounding environment that dose not allow for healthy relationships to grow and prosper.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qNz1AiIEqbObDd4FNcZg7HLvZq3.jpg", "actors": ["Ebrahim Bahar (Mustafa)", "Rashed Al-Hassan (Hassan)", "Mariam Ziman (Fatima)", "Gahtan Al-Gahtani (Mohammed)", "Latifa Mujren (The Mother)", "Abdulrahman Barakat (The Father)", "Toffol Gassim Hadad ()", "Soad Ali (Huda)", "Farah Ali ()", "Anwar Ahmed (Gang man)", "Norah Yousif (The neighbor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
