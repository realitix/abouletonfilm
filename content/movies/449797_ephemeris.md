Clipson and Onda each investigate very personal, intuitive spaces, through their favored technologies of Super 8mm film and cassette Walkman. Both artists base a significant emphasis of their work on performance environments, where their visual and sonic field recordings interact to create sensory collages born out of the subjective impressions of the audience.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p4IljWGMphRgL0VAMlAvuujTh8g.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
