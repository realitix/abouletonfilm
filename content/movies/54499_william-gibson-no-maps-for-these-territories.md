The limo was rigged with digital cameras, a computer, a television, a stereo, and a cell phone. Generated entirely by this four-wheeled media machine, No Maps for These Territories is both an account of Gibson\u2019s life and work and a commentary on the world outside the car windows. Here, the man who coined the word \"cyberspace\" offers a unique perspective on Western culture at the edge of the new millennium, and in the throes of convulsive, tech-driven change.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/329157hdloFLqZzyq7BoFQKEszS.jpg", "actors": ["William Gibson (Himself)", "Bono (Himself)", "The Edge (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [48894], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
