Akomfrah has disguised this exploration as a science fiction story \u2013 in the manner of the groundbreaking writers profiled in The Last Angel of History \u2013 while providing a bravura display of the aesthetics of video art in the 1990s. The tale of visitors from the future who gather dreams from unwitting subjects in order to construct a history of the Black diaspora both defamiliarizes Akomfrah\u2019s ongoing project and points to the danger that extracting history from memory can be a kind of expropriation.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
