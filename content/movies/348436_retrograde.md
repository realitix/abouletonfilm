The rarely visited and near-empty space station 'Sage' orbits the city and its inhabitants. Two remain stranded on board, a human called Jemima and a bored and lonely alien tourist called London. Oblivious to the danger, they missed boarding the last escape pods to evacuate the station's population to the city below. London's unresisting affection for Jemima is tested when she comes up with a plan to escape their situation, whether he likes it or not. The short is a stop motion film, animated with characters made with armature bodies and hand-drawn replacement faces, and sets made primarily with cardboard.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5ijQ0T83k3elSQoM4YYTEKQPXSE.jpg", "actors": ["Jasmine Hughes (Jemima Puddle (voice))", "Warren Saint George II (Sage (voice))", "Chase Woolner (London (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
