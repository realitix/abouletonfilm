His possessions, which had been sold as material properties, had been purchased by Stamply, a farmer. The latter restores them to the Marquis, who decides to allocate old Stamply with the use of a corner of his manor. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de la Seigli\u00e8re, the Marquis's daughter, takes care of the old man. But this one, devastated by death of his son, buried under the ice of the Berezina, dies. Some time later, three persons come to live in the manor: M. de Paubert, his son Raoul, and Destournelles, a crafty, ruthlessly ambitious lawyer. De Paubert hopes to marry his son to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de la Seigli\u00e8re and might well achieve his aim but for the unexpected return of Bernard Stamply, who has escaped death miraculously. He gets to know Hel\u00e8ne and the two young people fall in love with each other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fj3GBBySXf0jJXVP1TmRkYZCd5N.jpg", "actors": ["Huguette Duflos (H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de la Seigli\u00e8re)", "Catherine Fonteney (La baronne de Vaubert)", "F\u00e9lix Huguenet (Le marquis de la Seigli\u00e8re)", "Charles Granval (Stamply p\u00e8re)", "Romuald Joub\u00e9 (Bernard Stamply fils)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
