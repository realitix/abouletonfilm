Trouble ensues when he is mistakenly given a huge fortune in stocks that he can spend any way he pleases. At the same time, his daughter has fallen in love with an impoverished, but good hearted boy. When the kibitzer suggests he bet all his money on a dog of a racehorse, the lad does it. Against all odds, the horse wins, and suddenly the young man is quite wealthy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iqmiLfkpWExtrqWp0bThazhtCCu.jpg", "actors": ["Harry Green (Ike Lazarus)", "Mary Brian (Josie Lazarus)", "Neil Hamilton (Eddie Brown)", "Albert Gran (James Livingston)", "David Newell (Bert Livingstone)", "Guy Oliver (McGinty)", "Tenen Holtz (Meyer)", "Henry Fink (Kikapoupolos)", "Lee Kohlmar (Yankel)", "E.H.
