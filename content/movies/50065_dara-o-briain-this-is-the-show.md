Dara is on top form as he effortlessly mixes off the cuff audience interaction with razor sharp material and a star studded finale that almost puts Hollywood to shame. \"O Briain is loud and large and fast and feisty...............but the way he tells 'em is a joy\" - The Times \"O Briain has a laser eye for the absurd and the spurious amid the too-much-stuff with which we shore up our hapless lives\" - The Guardian \"Breakneck genius...... the entire audience was hanging on every sentence. And every sentence ended in a laugh. It was stuffed with dazzling observations, vivid vignettes and glorious gags.\" Evening Standard", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/psTAbgUBiLyPlhXM1RwwnlnETWx.jpg", "actors": ["Dara \u00d3 Briain (Himself)", "Jimi Mistry (Himself)", "Richard Hills (Organist)", "Peter Dickson (Announcer (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [25604, 49614, 26556, 18199], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
