The film's haunting images, evoking teenage love gone wrong, are counterpointed by a series of saccharine torch songs, celebrating falling in love and the end of a masquerade. Through a kind of bathetic synthesis, the dialectic of Eros and Thanatos, love and death, is consummated in the 'morgue' of the forensic archive.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rloFAzbuChQd6BEdBKkf8sq8z9J.jpg", "actors": ["Juliette Armstrong ()", "Caryn Clark ()", "Brigette Gale ()", "Dennis Harris ()", "Anton Marin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
