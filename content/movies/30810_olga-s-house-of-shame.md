As the vicious Olga (Audrey Campbell) expands her criminal empire, she also encounters more resistance as a string of once-trusted partners turn traitor in an effort to steal the successful racket out from under her. The result is exactly what fans of the series expect, a barrage of torture scenes featuring soldering irons, floggings, spankings, and even an electric chair. As with its predecessors, Olga's House of Shame is a silent black and white film with narration to explain the action, but even with direct commentary it's difficult to keep track of the characters and Campbell (who is occasionally caught laughing out loud at the absurdity of it all) has all the menace of a kindergarten teacher, even when wielding a machete.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oampyuoWprKn3iimYJeU8GhpkmQ.jpg", "actors": ["Audrey Campbell (Olga)", "Judy Young (Elaine)", "W.B.
