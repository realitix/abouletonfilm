After wishing he had more friends, Manny finds a mysterious collar and puts it on Rufus, the family dog. Suddenly, Rufus turns into a boy! Manny's not sure what to do, so he enrolls Rufus in school. When the other students notice Rufus's silly dog antics -- chasing squirrels, eating without utensils, asking for belly rubs, and catching a soccer ball with his mouth -- he immediately becomes the most popular kid around. Manny is jealous of his new best friend but eventually learns that a dog's loyalty to his owner always comes first.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cZSBLClTKKAkpWQTM9omf1k1Fy3.jpg", "actors": ["Davis Cleveland (Manny Garcia)", "Jace Norman (Rufus)", "Darien Provost (Devon)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [435737, 246569, 407655, 89185], "youtube_key": "008Mh9aJubs"}
