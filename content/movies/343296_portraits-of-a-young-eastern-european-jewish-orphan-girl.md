The charming portrait of this young girl is sublimated with incessant tender zooms in and out on her face and her discreet smile, to accordion music. It\u2019s a portrait-film, a dream-like film that has no contemporary equivalent to its formal and symbolic content. It is not a declaration of love, but a brief moment of admiration for beauty and the noble side of human nature.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x5eFP8k4ghJfTiAzLZv10UquW28.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
