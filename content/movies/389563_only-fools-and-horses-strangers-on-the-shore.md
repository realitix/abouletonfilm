At the village they learn that Albert was a real ladies' man, which could be why most of the menfolk resemble him. Back in Peckham they discover a young man who seems to have stowed away in their van and can only answer \"Gary\" to everything asked of him. In fact he is called Rashid and he was loading the van when he got trapped behind the booze. He was carried to England against his wishes and Del and company get charged with kidnapping him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9NQf7cBqkMP6iQeq7IiCSJqmifl.jpg", "actors": ["David Jason (Derek 'Del Boy' Trotter)", "Nicholas Lyndhurst (Rodney Trotter)", "Tessa Peake-Jones (Raquel Turner)", "Gwyneth Strong (Cassandra Trotter)", "Roger Lloyd Pack (Trigger)", "John Challis (Boycie)", "Sue Holderness (Marlene)", "Paul Barber (Denzil)", "Roy Heather (Sid)", "Patrick Murray (Mickey Pearce)", "Nabil Elouahabi (Rashid Mahmoon/Gary)", "James Ellis (George Parker)", "David Ross (Monsieur Douche)", "Martin Friend (Mayor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
