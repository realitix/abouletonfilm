Gene is courting Ritz (Kathleen Empleo) and requires Sieg\u2019s help to summon the girl\u2019s attention. Inside a dingy pad they call \u201ctambayan\u201d - an empty room with a single mattress plopped down the floor and nothing else \u2013 the three characters exchange their awkward flirtations (if you could call it that). Unknown to Gene, Ritz is really attracted to the bashful Sieg who in turn seems more interested with his best friend than with Ritz.
