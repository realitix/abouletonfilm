L Company 42 Commando Royal Marines, commanded by Captain Jeremy Moore, was hastily sent to Limbang. They were given one mission: \"Rescue the hostages\".  Presented by Major General Julian Thompson, \"Return to Limbang\" recreates this forgotten story of heroism under fire through re-enactments, and never before seen archive footage. With breathtaking scenery of North Borneo as the backdrop, ex-Royal Marines return to face and confront their former enemies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bjSSWecQ1wOlEHymzl7uhYlOmtO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
