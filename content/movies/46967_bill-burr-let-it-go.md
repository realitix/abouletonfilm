The name itself is synonymous with legendary performances. Countless iconic musicians and comedians have been on that stage. To be a part of that history was something I\u2019ll never forget. As much as I was trying to keep my head together before the show, I couldn\u2019t help but feel like a tourist or just some random dude who won a contest. LET IT GO represents the culmination of material I developed on the road from 2008-2009. As always thanks to everyone who came out to my shows, laughed at the funny stuff and stared during the bombing. I hope you enjoy it. \u2013 Bill Burr", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4E2eK7HakEpNJPR17CRTpBsgC2O.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Burr (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [32836, 308571, 191489, 216652], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
