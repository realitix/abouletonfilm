Director Nakamura Ryugo was born in 1996. He made this film, his feature debut, when he was just fourteen years old. Okinawa has an old tradition of eating a goat for celebratory occasions. But that culture is starting to fade in urban areas. Yuto (Uehara Soji), a sixth grader living in Naha, spends his winter vacation in the countryside town where his grandparents reside. He receives a shock when he sees the goat raised by his grandfather killed by locals.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fQFIuNdFqy2VNaDgSFUiG7d9Jv.jpg", "actors": ["Seima Gima ()", "Susumu Taira ()", "Soji Uehara ()", "Taeko Yoshida ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "bljVGLn456Q"}
