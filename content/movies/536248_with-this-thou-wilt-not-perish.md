This region has been called different names in different eras. Its namesakes have been buildings in nearby areas, all of which now disappeared; places like the Shinyoung Shopping Complex, which was dismantled; Baeksukdongcheon, an area now under restoration plan; Segumjeong, an already-restored building. Buildings are not the only objects of restoration. The history of Segumjeong and Hongjecheon was also restored. Perhaps everything the film shows may be a kind of restoration", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rsqjUlD962WSyIfCWHDqEvogRXd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
