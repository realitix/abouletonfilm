In his naivete, Raghu thinks he must protect the virtue of that joint's floozies from grabby clients, especially Sweety, a hitman's honey whose cynical surface masks a soft spot for the clueless hero. But he only has eyes for Neeta, a quintessential TV-soap suffering-heroine played by not-so-nice Reshma.
