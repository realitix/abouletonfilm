Intertwining the stories of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's creation with the true story of Eva Peron, she celebrates the extraordinary show in the 40th year after its creation.  Meeting musical stars including Elaine Paige, Hal Prince and Tim Rice, she hears how the show came into being, all inspired by a face on a postage stamp. She then travels to Argentina, meeting politicians, performers and Eva fans to hear how this intensely divisive figure - loved by the poor, loathed by the rich - became one of the enduring icons of our time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fld5vp57s9gBKNgrenOpi3MoZ2g.jpg", "actors": ["Suzy Klein (Presenter)", "Elaine Paige ()", "Elena Roger ()", "Tim Rice ()", "Harold Prince ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
