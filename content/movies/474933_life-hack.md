After struggling actress Carolyn (Jessica Copeland) gets hacked, Charlie and Jack decide to embark on a tense and amusing search for the twistedly righteous Moraler before he releases Bobby\u2019s graphic masturbation video to social media. The suspense and wit keep you captivated and laughing with cameos from Sean Kleier (\"Odd Mom Out\") and Devin Ratray (\"Nebraska,\" \"Blue Ruin\"). \"Life Hack\" is an incredibly relevant comedic cautionary tale about our digital privacy\u2026or complete lack thereof.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hNIpKzeZ1gZJ9kqUcu0cUXfaYdl.jpg", "actors": ["Derek Wilson (Charlie)", "Jessica Copeland (Carolyn)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "bmtQ-eVdXEo"}
