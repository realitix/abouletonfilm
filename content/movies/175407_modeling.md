Meanwhile, across the studio, Max is animating Koko. When he's called over to consult on the too-accurate bust, Koko gets mischievous and creates his own drawings. He then escapes and crawls inside the clay bust, eventually wriggling off like an inchworm. He gets into a fight with the man being modelled, both of them flinging wads of clay.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qzWwDKWoqDPIyc0FsydcYU2DWgT.jpg", "actors": ["Max Fleischer (Cartoonist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
