Maari (Dhanush) still rules his locality with the help of his best friend Kalai (Kreshna). One thing he hates in his career is drug business, but the rival gang wants him to join with them so they can sneak it without any problem.\r\n\r\nBut, Maari strongly opposes the plan. Meantime, there is Beeja also known as Thanatos (Tovino Thomas) who has vengeance against Maari for killing his brother. When Beeja escapes from jail, he works with Maari\u2019s rivals and plans a cunning scheme to separate Maari from Kalai.\r\n\r\nBeeja\u2019s idea works well and he nearly kills Maari and his lover Aarathu Aanandhi (Sai Pallavi). But they abscond, get married and settles in Tenkasi to lead a peaceful life. But situation forces Maari to return back to his area once again to finish off his rivals.\r\n\r\n\u2018Maari 2\u2019 has all masala ingredients needed for a commercial film.
