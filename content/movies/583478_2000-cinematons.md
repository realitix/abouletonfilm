Historical, ethnological, sociological and psychological, this anthology is a living record of the artistic community of the last 20th century which attempts to answer these questions: Why film everyone? Why choose cultural personalities? How do the subjects look at their image? How much exhibitionism and narcissism is involved in being filmed?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Luc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez ()", "Florence Loiret Caille ()", "Luc Moullet ()", "Arielle Moullet ()", "Dominique Noguez ()", "Dominique Pa\u00efni ()", "Jaques Dutoit ()", "Philippe Sollers ()", "Vincent Nordon ()", "Joseph Morder ()", "Georges Londeix ()", "Alain Paucard ()", "G\u00e9rard Courant ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
