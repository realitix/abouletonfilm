{"tmdb_id": 450566, "title": "New Shores", "original_title": "New Shores", "slug_title": "new-shores", "date": "1987-01-01", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "NEW SHORES is a sister film to IN THE STONE HOUSE in many ways. Like the latter film, it consists of earlier footage edited in recent years. It could be seen as a sequel to IN THE STONE HOUSE especially since it begins with a cross-country journey to the West Coast, where I settled, and concludes with a visit, in 1987, to the \u201cstone house\u201d in rural New Jersey. Even though there is some sort of time line that can be imagined, the film stands on its own. It is simply a series of episodes that touch upon facets of living in a new area with new weather, new people, new identities and stubborn old fears. The Bolex camera goes to work across landscapes and living areas, workplaces and gatherings. A dance of images: can beauty partner with dread and death? It\u2019s a film of the coexistences that percolate beneath the surface of ordinary events. A film of useless hopes and baseless fears.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7sQpVgiobk7DDeV6LljR9bR7gzL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
