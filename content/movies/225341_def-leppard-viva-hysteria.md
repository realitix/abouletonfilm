Plus two additional hits, \"Rock of Ages\" and \"Photograph\" as an encore.  Finally \"Viva! HYSTERIA\" showcases for the first time a career-defining album (excluding concept albums) performed live in its entirety - from start to finish - for a commercial audio/video release. \"Viva! HYSTERIA\"! is unlike any show Def Leppard has ever done or will ever do again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/piJFXz8eaMaS10aCQW5wB8Dzta5.jpg", "actors": ["Rick Allen (Drums)", "Joe Elliott (Vocals)", "Rick Savage (Bass)", "Phil Collen (Guitars)", "Vivian Campbell (Guitars)", "Def Leppard ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [124804], "youtube_key": "Qq73DjaK5DQ"}
