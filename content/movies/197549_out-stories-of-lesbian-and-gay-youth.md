The journeys for most were emotional and sometimes painful, but ultimately a source of strength and hope. Also included are the tales of young transvestites and street hustlers who have had to leave home because of rejection by their families. P-Flag, a support group for parents of gays is also briefly profiled.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dW1wxAvi855jzhFxwGC7vc6auh5.jpg", "actors": ["Scott Thompson (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
