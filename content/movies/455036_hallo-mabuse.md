A nod of the head, which seems treacherous in its mechanical repetition, meets the profile of a bearded man who does not appear to react at all in a suggested counter shot. The slight flickering of the image further intensifies the impression of an illicit agreement, of witnessing a crooked handshake. The ringing of the unseen telephone and the constant ticking of a clock lend the events a limited temporality. Something is running out, and in doing so, is also already reaching its end, a ghostly final act, which is anticipated by an explosion and breaks off with the sound of a falling guillotine.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/txjTwIRCS9Owt9emfSKYBDsZTSC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
