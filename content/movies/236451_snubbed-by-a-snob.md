But the horse's mother pulls him away, saying we don't associate with that kind. Spunky makes a few more overtures, and eventually they set off on a chase, running across a bull from time to time. The horse stops to eat a lot of apples and drink far too much water; this leaves him too bloated to move much at all. The two continue to anger the bull, which gives chase; Spunky saves the colt, and they all live in harmony.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AoaL6Flu1ffAmX4KJI160yayvx4.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Mercer (Hunky / Spunky / Stallions / Bull (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
