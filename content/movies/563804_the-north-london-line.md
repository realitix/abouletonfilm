To record this for posterity,the train operator at the time, Silverlink Trains, allowed Video 125 cameras unrestricted access to train cab and stations along the route.  The route was electrified at 25KV overhead to allow vital freight movements around the capital. One of the most unusual stations is that at Willesden Junction, the platforms being positioned above the West Coast Main Line and the affiliated \u201cDC lines\u201d from Euston to Watford.  The history of the route is complex but totally fascinating, details of which are related en route by Rob Curling.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ICyRrGR43emuU9IrpsVT8j3OX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "E3ugOBlmcoA"}
