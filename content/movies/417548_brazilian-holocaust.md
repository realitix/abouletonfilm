There they were tortured, raped and killed without anyone caring about their fate. Famous journalists, in the 1960s and 70s, made reports denouncing the ill-treatment. None of them - as Daniela Arbex does now - could tell the whole story. Sixty thousand died. Some managed to survive. And they now tell a little about the terrifying history of the Cologne Hospital.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/76muwL3vWeojBD5N2ARsgFrtXPx.jpg", "actors": ["Helv\u00e9cio Ratton (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [45318, 429210, 10166, 8440], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
