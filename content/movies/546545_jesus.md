Not only must he fit in at a new school, but it's a Christian one to boot. At first he's puzzled when he and his classmates are called to \"worship\", but he gradually adjusts to his new environment. One day, in the middle of a prayer, he sees a very small Jesus appear before him. Each wish Yura makes to Jesus comes true, and he starts to have faith in the power of the Lord.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fCyvMhaF9opEduMM2W2OfWuzeU1.jpg", "actors": ["Kenichi Akiyama ()", "Kenichi Akiyama ()", "Y\u00fbko Kibiki ()", "Masayasu Kitayama ()", "Chad Mullane ()", "Kouichi Nihei ()", "Ippei Ohsako ()", "Hinako Saeki ()", "Yura Sato (Yura Hoshino)", "Akko Tadano ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
