Their name is the German term for \"dancing mania\", but is directly translated with \"dance-rage\". Tanzwut are known for their heavy use of bagpipes, an unusual instrument for a metal band. The group has achieved international success, filling concert halls as far away from their home country as Mexico. The band's recent releases have been gravitating towards a more industrial metal approach, incorporating the use of more down-tuned guitars, harsher vocals and darker atmospheres. Tanzwut's live performances have a medieval theme, expressed through their stages, costumes and choreography.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3kdqOjaHwx1NgmWfikHtnol8fYK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
