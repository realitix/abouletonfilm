I stayed there for three months. It was a very turbulent time: having to adjust to depending on cars to get around (without having a driver\u2019s license), my girlfriend being rushed to the hospital with blood clots stuck in her lungs (and almost dying), and trying to keep my freelance jobs back at home running while being far away. We found solace and tranquility in the sunsets when the heat would die down and we'd gather with friends to eat and drink.\" -Bram Ruiter", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6gGhxvM9LeK4boV1PHYClBDq8Ev.jpg", "actors": ["Claudi Moll (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
