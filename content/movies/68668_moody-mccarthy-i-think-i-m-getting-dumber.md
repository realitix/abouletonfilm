Because that's what you'll be doing when you watch the hilarious standup of famed \"wordsmith\" (he's not sure of the spelling) Moody McCarthy (Jimmy Kimmel Live, Last Comic Standing IV). With razor sharp wit and originality Moody looks at everything from life in New York City to the pitfalls of living in the Computer Age (It's not good when the girl you met online rolls to the bathroom on shoes that light up). Sit back, relax, and let Moody take care of the laughs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vFubsDGVEEJlBv7Av4tOhUq2RA4.jpg", "actors": ["Moody McCarthy (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
