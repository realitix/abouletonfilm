It's all around in nature. Only birds and man can sing; man \"sings\" even when he speaks. We see a quick survey of the stages of life, as captured by songs: the alphabet song for primary school, Here Comes the Bride, The Old Gray Mare, etc. Some inspirations for song are outlined in song: love, sailing, trains, the West, motherhood, etc., but \"we never sing about brains.\" Finally, an example of how a simple melody can be expanded into a symphony: an elaborate version of the simple tune that opened the lesson", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dJfy7lXNFnCTE0Gfmgt777SX7V8.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Thompson (Professor Owl)", "Harry Stanton (Bass Singer in Canoe and Ship)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [67173, 57217, 47468, 100308], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
