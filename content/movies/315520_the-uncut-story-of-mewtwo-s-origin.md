To achieve his military needs, he covets a Pok\u00e9mon stronger and more adept than any other, a veritable living war weapon, so he enlists a scientist named Doctor Fuji to create this being from the DNA of the ancestor of all Pok\u00e9mon and most powerful of Pok\u00e9mon, Mew, which Fuji had found on a previous jungle expedition. Fuji accepts, for he is heavily into the prospect of cloning to create and restore life itself, because of his love for his deceased daughter, Amber.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rX9FB0YoeFBXYCWwy3M6GNxNCTu.jpg", "actors": ["Addie Blaustein (Dr. Fuji, Young Mewtwo)", "Kerry Williams (Ambertwo)", "Tara Jayne (Bulbasaurtwo)", "Michael Haigney (Charmandertwo)", "Eric Stuart (Squirtletwo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
