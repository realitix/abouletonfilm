In this crudely rendered home video of a commune of stoned revolutionaries, the cameras are hand-held, the edits in-camera, and the dialogue is wryly on-target. Pettibon's band of outsiders reenacts a countercultural moment defined by rock music, drugs, and ideological paradox \u2014 and in so doing, captures their own late-80's West Coast grunge milieu as well.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6AJjl3MS6GcPRKUd62JmkBczVmy.jpg", "actors": ["Kim Gordon (Bernadine Dohrn)", "Thurston Moore (Jeff Jones)", "Mike Watt (Gabe Nemisch)", "Abby Travis (Jane Fonda)", "Joe Cole ()", "David Markey (Allen Ginsberg/Yoko Ono)", "Raymond Pettibon (Serge Soulberg)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "oa2BXSezPgM"}
