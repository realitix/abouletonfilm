The fans bunch awkwardly around them as Win Butler intones into a ghetto-taped megaphone. Renowned for their sojourns into the crowd, this particular gimmick is usually configured as a populist transgression of the supposed boundary between performer and audience. But this footage shows indie\u2019s high priests seeming uneasy among the faithful, who appear to share the feeling. No species of direct connection is sought. Even in such close quarters, the act of leveling can only be achieved through the conduit of the music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/koHOIuwpb5KHEtBd1FUGC9GCzfG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
