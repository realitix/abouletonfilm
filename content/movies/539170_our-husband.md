When a husband disappears in an accident, the wife is dismayed by a social butterfly pregnant with her husband's child. To preserve the husband's blood line, the wife takes care of the expectant mother and raises the child. Featuring the two ravishing beauties Li Lihua and Sun Jinglu, Our Husband foregoes juicy feuds between the leads and delivers an allegorical message: parents should provide an ideal environment for the next generation. Addressing the rocky times in China, it is equally overt in its remonstration as Yung Hwa's earlier works, The Soul of China and Sorrows of the Forbidden City.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Li Li-Hua ()", "Jinglu Sun ()", "Yan Hua ()", "Wei Wang ()", "Jiang Ming ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
