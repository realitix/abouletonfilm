A lunatic asylum in the city of Lahore becomes a mirror image of events in the outside political world, with the same actors playing both inmates and rulers. Adapted by Tariq Ali and McMullen from famous Urdu writer Saadat Hasan Manto's short story 'Toba Tek Singh', Partition speaks for the countless millions that the usual British Raj films sweep out of sight.  Released to mark the 60th anniversary of the partition of the Indian sub-continent, this is the film's first-ever release on DVD.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3epji9lFX0n6HnRmdysTGsnHJjE.jpg", "actors": ["Roshan Seth ()", "Zia Mohyeddin ()", "Zohra Sehgal ()", "Saeed Jaffrey ()", "John Shrapnel (General Flood)", "Tariq Yunus ()", "Sunil Tanna ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
