Their downfall comes when they suspect one of the boys, Pep, of ripping them off, and his accidental death causes disloyalty among the teens, who suspect Dante offed them. All of this is perfect for the return of Gabriel, a one-time partner of Dante, who has just been released from jail, and has an almost angelic demeanor and the certainty that he can fix everyone's lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lweN1gRGw4yb2hW3wKSuXTSHOl1.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Rapaport (Dante)", "Lili Taylor (Micky)", "Adam Trese (Gabriel)", "Kevin Corrigan (Francis (Cisco))", "Angela Featherstone (Lilly)", "Tony Danza (D'Avalon)", "Isaac Hayes (George)", "Oscar Isaac (Pool Boy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
