But what began as a December snowfall quickly becomes a threatening winter storm, and school is dismissed for the day. The students who are unable to arrange transportation before the storm grows are forced to remain in the school gym. The six familiar strangers are the only students remaining as the outdoor conditions worsen and the doors are locked. Wills are tested, friendships are created, and secrets are revealed as they realize they must rely on each other to make it through the night.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6HNQUYs4djLjCC8vEUWf3b3iI91.jpg", "actors": ["Hollie Shay (MaryJake Harper)", "Vincent Seidle (Grayson Thompson)", "Katie McCaffrey (Camille Sanders)", "Ashley Murray (Anthony Goodwin)", "Elizabeth Potthast (Lynn Bolton)", "Karen Boles (Cynthia Burgess)", "Aaron Michael Johnson (Brant Journigan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "o7cwsvDkHOo"}
