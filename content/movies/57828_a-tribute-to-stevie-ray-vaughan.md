Vaughan, standing at center stage, launches into \"Six Strings Down,\" A moving tribute to his late brother, Stevie Ray, whose memory has drawn this group together. The guitarists fall in, each finding a corner of the song to call their own; King plays fills to Clapton's solo, Cray fires off economical, chiming counterpoint to Raitt's stinging slide, and Guy unleashes piercing single-notes bends to answer Vaughan, who's finger-picking the main theme on his battered Stratocaster. Suddenly, the song blasts into the stratosphere, a gorgeous mosaic of clarion guitar tones.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lwWYkmJ05zVBqkfJPel9v7aHwFB.jpg", "actors": ["Eric Clapton (Himself)", "Buddy Guy (Himself)", "Robert Cray (Himself)", "Bonnie Raitt (Herself)", "Jimmie Vaughan (Himself)", "Art Neville (Himself)", "Stevie Ray Vaughan (Himself)", "B.B.
