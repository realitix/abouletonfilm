Fadi, a forty year old, packs his luggage and sets out to the airport with his friend driving him. He is supposed to leave for a month, but instead of going up the plane, he heads to the arrivals section and rents a car. He takes the highway heading North then continues on a mountainous route. Far from anyone, on a deserted highway, a deviation forces him to quit the main road. A distinct sound coming from far is heard; the sound of a car honk. Fadi gets closer and closer to the sound and sees a wrecked car crashed in a tree alongside the road. A couple lay still inside.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f1yVnxkLSZj7AoIyEx6OrFI116D.jpg", "actors": ["Fadi Abi Samra ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
