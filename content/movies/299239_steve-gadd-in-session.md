This classic video will give you a behind-the-scenes look at masters at work as they arrange tunes, work on grooves, and play funk, Latin, reggae, shuffles and ballads. This video comes with its own accompanying instructional booklet, contains a wealth of teaching by simply showing Gadd playing his relentlessly impeccable licks in loose improvisatory jams, and fleshing them out with illustrative voiceover comments.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cYDo4Y96XOH9xmQT00WAowqdAK0.jpg", "actors": ["Steve Gadd (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
