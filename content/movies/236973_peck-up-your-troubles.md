He climbs, but the bird greases the tree; he starts to cut it down, but a mean dog stops him (this becomes a running gag). Several other attempts follow; at one point, he puts his paw into the bird's home, and the bird puts a tomato there; Sylvester squishes it, and the bird dresses as an angel to torment him, but Sylvester sees through the disguise. Finally, Sylvester tries to blow up the tree; the dog again intervenes. Sylvester gets the dynamite off the tree and puts out the fuses, but the bird has lit them again, and now Sylvester really becomes an angel.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jn9U8sbklJMTNJjKBqMcR6SW6pZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
