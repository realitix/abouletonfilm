Then when he goes to the insurance company, he\u2019s told they won't pay because the damage falls under the \"Act of God\" exclusion in his policy. With nothing left, and nothing left to lose, he decides to sue God himself for damages, naming representatives of the world's religions as defendants in the suit.
