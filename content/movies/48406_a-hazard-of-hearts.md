In a final game, he stakes his daughter's hand in marriage, convinced that this time he will not lose. Unfortunately, however, he does lose; to the evil Lord Wrotham. Unable to return home and tell his daughter that he has lost her in a game of dice, Sir Giles kills himself there and then. Lord Vulcan, who has witnessed the events, takes pity on Serena Staverley, although they have never met. He challenges Lord Wrotham to a game of dice in which the winner takes both Staverley Court and Miss Serena.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8sDMengYq37TbrcadhhjOSPQleL.jpg", "actors": ["Diana Rigg (Lady Harriet Vulcan)", "Edward Fox (Lord Harry Wrotham)", "Christopher Plummer (Sir Giles Staverley)", "Helena Bonham Carter (Serena Staverley)", "Neil Dickson (Nicholas)", "Fionna Fullerton  (Lady Isabel Gillingham)", "Stewart Granger (Old Vulcan)", "Anna Massey (Eudora)", "Eileen Atkins (Lady Harriet's Maid)", "Christopher Villiers (Captain Jackson)", "Gareth Hunt (Joker)", "Marcus Gilbert (Lord Justin Vulcan)", "Robert Addie (Lord Peter Gillingham)", "James Gaddas (Lord John Burley)", "Ben Aris (Lieutenant of Dragoons)", "Genevieve Allenbury (Yvette)", "Lea Rochelle (Marie Louise)", "Kenny Ireland (Padlett)", "Dan Meaden (Big Red)", "Daniel Moynihan (Referee)", "Nelville Phillip (1st Gambler)", "John Abbott (2nd Gambler)", "Josanne Haydon-Pierce (La Flamme)", "John Boswall (Meadows)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
