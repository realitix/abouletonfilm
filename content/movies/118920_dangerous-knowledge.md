The film also talks to the latest in the line of thinkers who have continued to pursue the question of whether there are things that mathematics and the human mind cannot know.  Dangerous Knowledge tackles some of the profound questions about the true nature of reality that mathematical thinkers are still trying to answer today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/miyE1fF2Qm2vwCqdq8jbxqnQjoC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
