Meanwhile, Beatrice, the raccoon, Fleurett, the bluebird, and Leopold, the bear cub donate their winter treats toward a cake to celebrate Jesus' birthday. Luigi, the bee, volunteers his bees wax for a beautiful Christmas candle. Gabriella, the ewe, and her lamb, Anthony offer their wool to be woven into a warm new robe for Francesco. Thought the animals give up much to surprise Francesco for the holidays...they sacrifice even more to learn that love outweighs all Gifts of Christmas!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ccpZ9h2ScICzLr9UWyLqwRL01Ke.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
