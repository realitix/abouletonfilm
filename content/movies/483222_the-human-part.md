Maintaining this fa\u00e7ade in order to save face has become something of a full-time job for him. When Pekka\u2019s parents unexpectedly come for a visit, he throws a lavish family dinner party in order to dispel any doubts. The soir\u00e9e is a success until Pekka\u2019s god-daughter gets run over by a car. The reckless driver becomes a mutual enemy for the family. The driver tries to atone for his actions, but the situation spirals out of control and Pekka attacks the man. Pekka realizes things have gone too far and decides to tell his family the truth. It does not hurt as much as Pekka thought, bringing the pieces of a once broken family back together.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/swKUgfpet2OltMrELyMoVBQt3WE.jpg", "actors": ["Hannu-Pekka Bj\u00f6rkman (Pekka Malmikunnas)", "Kari Hietalahti (Kimmo Hienlahti)", "Ria Kataja (Helena Malmikunnas)", "Asko Sarkola (Paavo Malmikunnas)", "Armi Toivanen (Maija Malmikunnas)", "Leena Uotila (Salme Malmikunnas)", "Della McLoud (Sini Malmikunnas)", "Nicole Stiles (Bika)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "JklpBlLHn5Q"}
