During Chile's transition from dictatorship to democracy (1988-1990), they forge a path from drug- and drink-fuelled nihilism and petty crime into the world of market-driven illegality and Niki begins a seemingly predestined relationship with the middle-class \"loca\", Manuela. Memorable episodes and characters, quotable dialogue and a mix of earthy national portrait and surrealistic flourish make this one of the key Chilean films of the Nineties.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ehHRK3cCTDBB8TEU23O97cJWQkn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
