It's a special tie-clip that when used with a pair of infra-red contact lenses enables the user to see through walls! The guy that stole them from the professor is putting it to good use by wearing it while playing poker and cleaning up! He should think bigger. The first thing Roger does when he discovers this little novelty is use it to spy on his girlfriend getting dressed! That's more like it.  This film really gets around. We travel from the Riviera to Geneva to Paris to Casablanca (the Casbah no less), and to Copenhagen. We even get a tour of the Tuborg brewery. There's a prolonged gun battle amongst the giant beer tanks. Talk about product placement!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wK9wK9zbBIP8KgAx7oisdZzVLPn.jpg", "actors": ["Roger Browne (Glenn Forest)", "Jos\u00e9 Greci (Helga)", "Sancho Gracia (John Parker)", "Roberto Messina (Omar)", "Carla Cal\u00f2 (Russian agent)", "Andrea Scotti (Frank)", "Helga Lin\u00e9 (Glenn's girlfriend)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
