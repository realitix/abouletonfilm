Full of candid interviews from celebrated figures to everyday people, health care professionals, sex therapists, zoologists, anthropologists, and religious figures, this feature length doc answers age-old questions like: What is masturbation? Will it make me go blind? Is it \"normal\"? Is it wrong? And why are we so afraid to be caught in the act? In a world where confusion about sexuality remains at the root of so many societal problems - rape, sexual abuse, and the threat of sexually transmitted diseases - \"Sticky\" will help shatter misconceptions and myths surrounding this intimate aspect of human sexuality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3pyu67Zpu8PtObjpal4Hq2mPpGV.jpg", "actors": ["Joycelyn Elders (Herself)", "Larry Flynt (Himself)", "Janeane Garofalo (Herself)", "Nina Hartley (Herself)", "Sadie Lune (Herself)", "Keith Morris (Himself)", "Joe Matt (Himself)", "Ant (Himself)", "Chris Gore (Himself)", "Sherri Williams (Herself)", "Betty Dodson (Herself)", "Ian Kerner (Himself)", "Patti Britton (Herself)", "Linda Mona (Herself)", "Robert Lawrence (Himself)", "Carol Queen (Herself)", "Thomas W.
