The film travels across oceans and centuries of time to trace the globally interlocking story of East and West.  Ancestors in the Americas is a two-part series that presents the history, challenges, and lasting impact of early Asian immigrants to the Americas, from the 1700s to the 1900s. The series follows their little-known journeys and stories, reveals their pioneering struggle against racial hatred and for basic rights, and depicts their lasting cultural, legal and economic contributions to the building of the Americas.  Using a \"documemoir\" approach, ANCESTORS IN THE AMERICAS brings to life this largely undocumented past and invites a new understanding of American history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u5DZX8SahtM7DEmpBxvRP4tGzr0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
