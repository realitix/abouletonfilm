After decades-worth of international touring with Anthrax, bumping elbows with illustrious (and sometimes ridiculous) characters all over the media spectrum, and undergoing general \"you won't believe this\" experiences-- SCOTT IAN certainly had some hilarious and surprisingly personal stories to share. \"Swearing Words\" is an honest look at the insane life that Scott has led for the last 31 years, the people he's met, and the events that coincide.
