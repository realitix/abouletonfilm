Both growing up as the children of two \"Mega Church\" Pastors, Jay and Sydney understand both the thrills and ills of church life all too well. As they begin to leap into the next chapter of their lives as husband and wife things begin to take a nasty turn and the couple finds themselves not being on the same page. Little do they know that jealous and vindictive people are lurking right under their noses that would love more than anything to see the demise of their relationship. With the couple being crowded with interference from overbearing family, friends and church members, will this couple find themselves calling it quits on Christmas Day or will their relationship be strong enough to survive against the odds?\r - Written by Cedric Moore", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
