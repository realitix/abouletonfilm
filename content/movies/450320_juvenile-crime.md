The girl was violently raped and subjected to torture and sexual degradation for example she was forced to masturbate. On 4th January 1989 four sadists beat her with an iron barbell, poured lighter fluid on her legs, arms, face and stomach, and immolated her. She died later that day of shock and her mutilated corpse was hidden in an oil-drum filled with cement.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Nao \u00d4take ()", "Hajime Mao (Boy A)", "Kazu Itsuki (Boy B)", "K\u00f4ichi Imaizumi (Boy C)", "Masayoshi Nogami (C's father)", "Yumi Yoshiyuki (C's mother)", "Reiko Aoki ()", "Seiji Nakamitsu ()", "Rinako Matsuoka ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
