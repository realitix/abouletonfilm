Nobody knows quite what to do. A stylish variation on the problems of triolism made with striking stability of style and a great feeling for mise-en-sc\u00e8ne. The film provides an impressive mixture of stylised camera angles and realism, by filming taut and geometrically in simple interiors and existing locations. Her self-confidently designed, naturally acted everyday drama made German critics compare it with the greats from film history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9uqYNRpNPoLgawWsAZblqFjllLL.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Maertens ()", "Wolfgang Michael ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
