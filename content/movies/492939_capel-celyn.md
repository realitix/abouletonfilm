Places change, not always for the better and not always by natural, benevolent or politically sound means. A place can be charged with atmosphere because of what it has been through or what it has been.  Phantom Brickworks is a collection of mostly improvised musical pieces, that for some years now, have provided me with a mental portal into places and times - some real, some imaginary, some a combination of both. Human beings are highly sensitive to the atmospheres of places, which can be enhanced or dramatically altered when you learn about the context of their history. Echoes and voices can sometimes be heard, in some way or another. Places sometimes have things to say.\u201d  \u2014 Bibio", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b4n3w2PF5wJHdYh8h5Hvzpzg3yF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "CJsBL-6Ixb8"}
