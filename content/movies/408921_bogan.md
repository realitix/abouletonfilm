Still can't believe that this is from the maker of the disaster movie - _Romeo Juliet_. Great & Unique concept. 1st half of the movie was a roller coaster ride .2nd half was good if not great. But the director+Jayam Ravi+Arvind Swamy combo keep the audience engaged. \r\nAfter Thani Oruvan the duo - _Jayam Ravi_ and _Arvind Swamy_ has given another scintillating performance. Nothing Much for Hansika to perform as such. But she was tolerable. Waiting for Bogan 2. Would rate this 7/10"}], "recommandations_id": [349200, 376440, 264041, 402780], "youtube_key": "zurMRcvMfZU"}
