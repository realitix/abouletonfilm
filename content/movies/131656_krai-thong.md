This fierce monster, Chalawan, has the power of turning into a human being when he enters his golden cave. Chalawan, in human guise, went into town one day and was utterly captivated by the daughter of a millionaire, Tapaokaew, and kidnapped her, returning with her to his cave. Her father, distressed by his daughter's disappearance, made an announcement that anyone strong enough to kill the legendary Chalawan would get as a prize his daughter, and a lot of money. Krai Thong knew this was a job for him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lkpIDBuigD8RTegTRh1LK0DjMwP.jpg", "actors": ["Chutima Every (Luemlaiwan)", "Jet Padoongtum (Chalawan)", "Praryfar Siriwidcha (Tapaokaew)", "Wannasa Thongviset (Tapaothong)", "Champagne X (Wilama)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
