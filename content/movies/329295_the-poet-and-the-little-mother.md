A creditor is dogging them, when a sudden bequest gives them some breathing-space. They buy an old house in a small village, where living is cheaper than in Copenhagen. The villagers are distrustful towards the newcomers. After a while the baker, the butcher and the grocer won't give Poeten and Lillemor credit anymore. Also the old creditor is back dogging them. Should Poeten renounce his high poetical standards and write simple verses for popular music, to get money?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tWDEdYDK6kIhkV3KaHVuNSlsMqs.jpg", "actors": ["Henning Moritzen (Poeten)", "Helle Virkner (Lillemor)", "Ove Sprog\u00f8e (Anton)", "Lis L\u00f8wert (Vera)", "Olaf Ussing (Kreditoren)", "Dirch Passer (Bageren)", "Judy Gringer (Lise)", "Jens Due (S\u00f8lvbryllupsg\u00e6st)", "Karl Stegger (Slagter)", "Holger Vistisen (G\u00e6st i restauranten)", "Vals\u00f8 Holm (K\u00f8bmanden)", "Helga Frier (K\u00f8bmandinden)", "Kjeld Petersen (Henry Hamber)", "Paul Hagen (Postbudet)", "Axel Str\u00f8bye (Landm\u00e5leren)", "Ole Mogens ()", "Henry Lohmann ()", "Bj\u00f8rn Spiro ()", "Jytte Abildstr\u00f8m (Nabokone i opgangen)", "Soffy Damaris ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [56866, 56858, 41600, 56864], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
