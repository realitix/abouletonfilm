Cross-cutting between the girl protagonist and her father, the film creates a sense of crisis and conflict. As the girl invests her feelings in her surroundings and describes events connected to her father, we are drawn into a world of pain and pathos.  Morley's first directorial credit was her graduation film from Central St. Martin's School of Art.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Imogen Nooney (Girl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
