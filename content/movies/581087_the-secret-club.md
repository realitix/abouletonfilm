Although curtains were always drawn and new members were put through a screening process, this rare sanctuary provided a safe space for meeting and dancing at a time when being outed meant social ruin. With humour and a touch of sadness, some of the survivors of those days share their joyous stories of love, lust and politics.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oXxkw25a1m37Y1AGSywQEVN0ilk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
