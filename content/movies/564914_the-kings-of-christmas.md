Pancini, a Staten Island electrician, and others such as Frank Seddio, an Assemblyman in Canarsie, Brooklyn, compete to have the biggest, brightest, most over-the-top Christmas house in New York City. This short documentary shows what motivates these men and what it takes for them to pull it off bigger and flashier every year--despite the sometime objections of angry neighbors.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uSJoDm44ctuOQn2bHqewtG6maLx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
