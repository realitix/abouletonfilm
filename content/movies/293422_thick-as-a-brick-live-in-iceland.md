Following this release Ian Anderson took both albums on the road to perform the complete story of Gerald Bostock and this concert from the tour was filmed in Iceland. The show combines music, video screens and mime to bring Gerald s tale to life as never before and create the definitive presentation of 'Thick As A Brick'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4nobwkhShJMGNrM1Ek35Q434EuM.jpg", "actors": ["Ian Anderson (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
