He grew up in a patriarchal family with his mother, father and two siblings. Home life was strict and regimented, his father was clearly the master of the house. But as a devout Jehovahs Witness, this was hardly out of the ordinary. On the surface, Donalds youth would resonate with anyone raised in the slow-paced sanctity of a small town. Years later, Donald would reveal a sad tale of survival, struggle and strife in his book, A Fathers Touch, his memoirs about enduring years of sexual abuse at the hands of his father, subsequently retold in this documentary Family Secrets, When Nobody's Looking.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
