He soon becomes a top chef and is so impressive that he enters a 'secret society' for chefs, who battle it out to see which one is the best. To his detriment he becomes so obsessive that the women in his life find him obnoxious and nothing seems likely to save him until the news of his patron's death slaps him in the face like a cold fish. In the end, the shock reminds him to keep his life in perspective.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c0pesxhCcfMA3poOjon7jM5oIKQ.jpg", "actors": ["Yorgos Karamihos (Thodoros Notaras)", "Theodora Tzimou (Katerina)", "Alexia Kaltsiki (Dimitra)", "Ioanna Tsirigouli (Michelle)", "Giorgos Nakos (Giorgos Stavrakas)", "Errikos Litsis (Pyrgiopoulos)", "Ilias Petropouleas (Cook Club President)", "Pantelis Kapsalis (Pantelis)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "EVQdlqLVNEQ"}
