Following the path of an ancient postal route, the ride captures the traditional world of the Sami people who are indigenous to northern Scandinavia and for whom reindeer herding remains a way of life.  Deliberately unhurried, the rhythmic pace of the reindeer guides us along an epic two-hour trip that takes us over undulating snowy hills, through birch forests, across a frozen lake and past traditional Sami settlements.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/caolF7xBJX7Qyca4FbyhL1oZeeM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
