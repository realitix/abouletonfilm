The offer is tempting and she thinks she'll make some quick money that she can later spend on a celebration for passing of her exam. Claudia invites the sheik over for a session, only to see the sheik faint, and lay lifeless and non-responsive on her massage table. Scared of her life being ruined forever, Claudia calls her best friend Jessie, an unemployed investigator, to help her resolve this problem.
