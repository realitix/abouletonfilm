Insatiable Obsession (2006) starts with a writer having writers block. His wife, Amy Lindsay, suggests that they rent a house with the hope it will cause inspiration. It does. It is not really clear if the story that unfolds is supposed to be true, or a product of his imagination. The house once was a brothel run by Monique Parent. Supposedly, there is $.5M hidden somewhere in the house, and real estate agent Chloe and her handyman boyfriend are trying to find it. The writer keeps talking to the ghost (Monique Parent).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bheu7YMCBQvX5jya3TEs009wLnX.jpg", "actors": ["Tiffany Taylor (Sexy Woman)", "Chloe (Kate)", "Amy Lindsay (Winn Blake)", "Monique Parent (Stella)", "Sean Juergens (Colin Blake)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
