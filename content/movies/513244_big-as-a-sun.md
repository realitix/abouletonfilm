With trippy lyrics, a middle finger raised to all genres, and a tightly knit bond thanks to many years of friendship, the band is aiming to fly even higher. The film moves with the group from sold-out concerts to isolation in a bunker and a long trip to the Danish island of Bornholm. It depicts a band that tries to find a foothold in a time of unrest and upheaval \u2013 both internally in the band and the world in general. The front figure and perfectionist Niels Brandt balances between his own ambitions and a person who in essence is just 33-year-old Niels. But just as the five friends are on the verge of fulfilling the dream that they have harboured since childhood, Niels's creative driving force \u2013 his darkness \u2013 has suddenly disappeared. Does Niels have to look for his darkness again to be able to formulate his visions?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d4BmA83SHo8sbWf8zkNQszTo9bB.jpg", "actors": ["Niels Brandt (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
