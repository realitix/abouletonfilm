By his side, we witness the fall of Mubarak, the rise and fall of Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood, and the rise of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. The level of craft in this film is extraordinary, and so is the close attention that the director pays to his difficult task: illuminating the compromised lives of the protagonist and his friends and the convulsive nation they call home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kDHclTy8rnGkpqU1XdmROGkCyHG.jpg", "actors": ["Mohamed Siam (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
