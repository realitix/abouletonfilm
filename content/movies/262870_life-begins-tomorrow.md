The story is very simple, a murderer will be released from prison and his wife is supposed to get him, but they miss each other which leads the man to self-doubt and anxious wandering and brooding.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z22jN2kneIU7PTvZVv3fNUcEgr7.jpg", "actors": ["Erich Hau\u00dfmann (Robert)", "Hilde von Stolz (Marie)", "Edith Schollwer (Kellnerin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
