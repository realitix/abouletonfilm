As Gina helps Adrian (who is a journalist) to write a book about Pancho Villa, she discovers the similarity between Villa's relation to women to that of Adrian and hers. She gets sick of only having sex, and when she decides to get married with him and have a baby, he escapes to buy cigarrettes and gets lost for three months. Gina forgets about him and gets a new boyfriend (half the age she is), and when Adrian tries to get her back and she refuses him and humiliates him, the one and only Pancho Villa appears as his machista conscience ready to do anything to get Gina back.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ve8xWhT4iYYO7mUH7glRIpPzuLs.jpg", "actors": ["Diana Bracho (Gina L\u00f3pez)", "Arturo R\u00edos (Adri\u00e1n Pineda)", "Jes\u00fas Ochoa (Pancho Villa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
