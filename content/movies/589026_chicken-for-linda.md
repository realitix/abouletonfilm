To make up for it, she promises to cook her some chicken with peppers, her dead dad\u2019s favorite dish. But how do you buy chicken on the day of a general strike? All the shops are closed. So you go to a farm in the country and persuade the farmer\u2019s wife to sell you a bird. Then, on the drive home, you have to explain to a policeman what a live chicken is doing in your car. In the meantime, the chicken jumps out and runs off. What follows is a frantic chase: Paulette after the chicken, the policeman after Paulette, then others including a truck driver allergic to chicken feathers and other zealous cops along with every kid in the neighborhood!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jDxuof39ojTSCTEKE95Ubxrwq7D.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
