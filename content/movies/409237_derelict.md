Using footage from the theatrical editions of both films to assemble the material to emphasize the strengths of Prometheus as well as its ties to Alien. On the visual side, black &amp; white is used to better marry the visual quality of the two originals (and also because both films look great in black &amp; white). Roughly 30 minutes has been cut from Prometheus and about an hour of Alien has been used in its place. Some content from the deleted scenes of Prometheus was also used.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jhOhikHsvnwoZoHIXML7XXTqWWV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
