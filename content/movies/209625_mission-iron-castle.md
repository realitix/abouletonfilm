Issei Mori directs Hiroki Matsukata as the reluctant leader of a small band of spies charged with kidnapping a noblewoman from a heavily ninja-proofed castle. The finality of the air slowly began to fill like smoke, and in all that had become dark the loyalty of the Ninja who dared to go shone like light as they entered a world shrouded in mystery. Things do not go as planned in what is possibly the darkest and most fatalistic of the already noir-ish 60\u2032s fare. Both the decade and it\u2019s distinctive style of shinobi cinema went out on a high note with Mission Iron Castle.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jYJuH7Mh7ji8rYXWLX57rpwEVm0.jpg", "actors": ["Hiroki Matsukata (Yoshiro)", "T\u00f4ru Minegishi ()", "Kojiro Hongo ()", "Michiyo Ookusu ()", "Yoko Namikawa ()", "Shiho Fujimura ()", "Taketoshi Nait\u00f4 ()", "Rokk\u00f4 Toura ()", "Saburo Date ()", "Asao Uchida ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
