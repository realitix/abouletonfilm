Considered a madman and pervert by his community, he ignores his detractors and makes his dream\u2014low-cost sanitary pads made by and for rural Indian women\u2014a reality. Using manually operated machines, Muruganantham\u2019s microbusiness model is focused on something more important than profits: providing sustainable employment, hygiene and emancipation to women who would otherwise go without. He\u2019s a man with a million-dollar idea\u2014except money has nothing to do with it.
