He can recite any Shakespeare sonnet and is facile with accents, but he can't land an agent or a job. During the course of one summing-it-all-up day, he drives his cab around the city dealing with fare evaders, an insolent stage manager determined to keep him from auditioning for his choice director, his estranged wife who has a new lover, his mistress who seems awfully close to her \"drawing teacher\", and two teenage sons whose bright visions of the future don't seem to include jobs. If he can only cope with all the annoyances of this day, maybe he can deal with the limitations in his abilities and his future.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cWdxMaiid4qagR72pvR0MeqL7XS.jpg", "actors": ["Geraldine Page (Mama)", "Philip Bosco (James Flanagan)", "Brian Bloom (Danny)", "Steven Weber (Sean)", "Olympia Dukakis (Mary)", "Linda Thorson (Andrea)", "James Tolkan (Turner)", "Louis Zorich (Lerner)", "Pierre Epstein (Morry)", "Bill Hickey (Papa)", "Theron Montgomery (Pickles)", "Ronald Yamamoto (Sushi)", "Cory Notrica (Gordon)", "Lynne Thigpen (Woman Cop)", "Gwyllum Evans (Church)", "E.R.
