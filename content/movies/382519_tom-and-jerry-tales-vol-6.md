Learn how the Declaration of Independunce and the first airplane flew into being. Music rules in three melodic misadventures including Kitty Cat Blues, a furocious Flamenco dance-off and a hip-hoppin` feud between Tom and DJ Jerry. This volume runs hot and cold with some roaring lion lunacy in Africa, tail-kicking kangaroo action in the Australian Outback, chilly silliness involving The Abominable Snowmouse, cockeyed hockey and an all-out snowball war. Get ready to travel to your fun zone with everyone's favorite cat-and-mouse team.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/giDBe2hFES5mK8eyv7WBs96MrIE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
