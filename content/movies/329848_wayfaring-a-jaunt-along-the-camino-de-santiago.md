So he spent a couple of months walking and interviewing folks along the Camino de Santiago in Spain and France in the spring of 2013. Hilarity and Culture ensue in \"Wayfaring - A Jaunt along the Camino de Santiago\". You'll meet...Monique, a New York sophisticate trying to lose her cynicism...Thrice-timer Eddie from Ireland who constantly waxes philosophic about the Camino....Brandon from Texas who finds himself skeptical of those who divulge their alleged reasons for walking The Way. Also, semi-crazed eatery owner Pilar whose on-camera rants are priceless. This is Herriott's seventh film involving long-distance treks and those he encounters along the way. It's characterized by his wry humor, good eye with the camera and occasional whining.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
