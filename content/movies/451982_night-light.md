Actually, the engraved art work was film on color negative, so that subtle variations in tone are recorded. The mood--enhanced by John Davis' original music--is dream-like. It is both lyric and crackling, producing a kind of anticipatory tension. The scenes, in the usual Jordan manner, follow the surreal principle of placing objects and people where the ought not to be, and making movements that in the waking world are impossible. Each scene is a kind of drama from another world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mlOeEXwwV6Lx1yOTntu3X5AF1IZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
