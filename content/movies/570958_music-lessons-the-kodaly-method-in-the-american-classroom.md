The method he developed uses a child's own natural instrument, the voice. Beginning with simple musical intervals, the child progresses from folk tunes and children's songs to the complex notes and rhythms of composed music--from Bye baby bunting to Bach. [The film] is a look at the Koda\u0301ly method of music training in public elementary schools in San Jose, California, and West Hartford, Connecticut. Ordinary children are shown in the film, but they exhibit extraordinary self-confidence, discipline, concentration, and an eagerness to learn. There is no such thing as failure in a Koda\u0301ly classroom; in fact, the children are able to correct their mistakes themselves. Moreover, the children will bring much of 'how' they learn in their music lessons--counting and problem-solving, left-to-right progression, following directions--to their study of reading, writing and arithmetic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rkMOFDAjpswe5A7GG2NvouMTmP5.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Cole (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
