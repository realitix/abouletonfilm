At 78 feet in height, the famous East Window at York Minster is the largest medieval stained-glass window in the country and it was the creative vision of a single artist - a mysterious master craftsman called John Thornton, one of the earliest named English artists.  The East Window of York Minster is far more than a work of artistic genius, it is a window onto the medieval world and the medieval mind - telling us who were once were and who we still are, all preserved in the most fragile medium of all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tfjbnQTwtjuGI0WD66KDsVV2tQ7.jpg", "actors": ["Janina Ramirez (Presenter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
