For many, this would be a nice, but for Swedish Reidar Frank (Brass Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m), pensioner Sigurd Vatne (Sverre Hansen) and crazy Alice Lindblad (Elsa Lystad) this is the worst thing that could have occurred. After countless neighborhood feuds they all had, by coincidence, decided to travel to the Canary Islands to escape the unwanted situation of Villa Road. Therefore, the disputes continue also in the holiday paradise of the other family members' great despair. This surprisingly leads to a lot of funny episodes that contain both problems with the travel company, absurd misunderstandings and intricate entanglement that eventually tie up to a pretty successful movie.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zu5q5vA8KnrXpbYCXOArP8MHqHl.jpg", "actors": ["Brasse Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m (Reidar Frank / Preben Hansen)", "Minken Fosheim (Bente Frank)", "Elin Thoresen (Trine Frank)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
