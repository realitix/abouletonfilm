The film opens with the sextet humiliating a respected painter\u2018s portraits of them, driving the man to a suspicious suicide. Later, while celebrating his son\u2018s impending marriage into a wealthy family, Ibaragiya releases six pigeons from a pleasure boat, each with a rolled up drawing of one of the beauties tied to their legs. He offers a cash reward to whomever recovers the pictures, but they instead become death notices of which of the six are next to die. Dandy Sashichi, pestered by his two underlings, gets involved in the case almost by chance, but it becomes personal when his beloved wife (Hibino) is abducted.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u6oXO41CyM9MlZ3xBQ8WHC0uUJA.jpg", "actors": ["Tomisabur\u014d Wakayama (Ningyo)", "Keiko Hibino (Okume)", "K\u00f4tar\u00f4 Sugie (Yonosuke)", "Misako Uji (Okyo)", "Sabur\u00f4 Sawai (Kumezo)", "Shigeru Amachi (Asaka Keinosuke)", "Koday\u00fb Ichikawa (Pirate)", "Sumiko Abe (Harunoya)", "Akiko Mie (Uneme)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
