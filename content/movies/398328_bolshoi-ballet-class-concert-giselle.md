Svetlana Lunkina makes a good Giselle and dances with skill and delicacy. Albrecht (Dmitry Gudanov) dances and acts his part with meaning in Act 1 and provides good support when required in Act 2. The unfortunate gamekeeper, Hans (Vitaly Biktimirov), equally acts and dances his role well and is summarily despatched by a very unforgiving Queen on the Wilis (Maria Allash) in Act 2. The Wilis rather steal the show in their famously renowned `danse des Wilis, which is performed with precision and grace.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/omiT0I16LsoqIQxzPMU5WWUXjGi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
