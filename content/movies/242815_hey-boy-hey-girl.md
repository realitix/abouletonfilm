Dorothy is active in her local parish which like all parishes, is constantly thinking of ways to raise funds. One of the needy projects is a boys' camp, so when Dorothy is approached by Louis Prima to sing with his band she agrees only on one condition -- that he perform a concert benefit for the parish church and boys' camp. The interactions between Dorothy and Prima lead toward romance and a happy ending, as well as a popular album with the same title song featured in this film. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, Rovi (NY Times Review).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9OQa39vws1HmrDY2otcijxYp6W1.jpg", "actors": ["Louis Prima (Himself)", "Keely Smith (Dorothy Spencer)", "James Gregory (Father Burton)", "Sam Butera (Himself)", "Henry Slate (Marty Morton)", "Henry Slate (Marty Moran)", "Kim Charney (Buzz)", "Barbara Heller (Grace Dawson)", "Asa Maynor (Shirley)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
