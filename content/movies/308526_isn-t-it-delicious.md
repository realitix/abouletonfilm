The family's destructive ways are offset by messy and somewhat humorous attempts by Joan to set her children on the right course before she dies. In this big dysfunctional mix, they will all learn to connect in their own ways, and realize on their own terms what life is about.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dyq3zYHmOilHWK8Kdzlicszr4Wx.jpg", "actors": ["Kathleen Chalfant (Joan Weldon)", "Keir Dullea (Bill Weldon)", "Alice Ripley (Caroline Weldon)", "Malachy McCourt (Father Bob)", "Robert LuPone (Sam Spenser)", "Mia Dillon (Molly)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
