One thin line that creates \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d. The importance of the borders has again a huge impact in Europe. Yesterday it was all about free movement. Today it\u00b4s about controled borders. And walls and fences have become normality. \u201cBefore our eyes\u201d is a testimony that shows a situation where Hungary, and indirectly Europe closes itself to the outside world. The film portrays four places, four events, which was filmed over three days in early September 2015, when the worst refugee crisis we have seen since the Second World War started in earnest. \u201cMy Europe does not build walls!\u201d said Stefan L\u00f6fven, the swedish prime minister, in a speech a few days later.
