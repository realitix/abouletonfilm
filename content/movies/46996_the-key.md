In the story, a four year old boy (Mohammed Aladpoush) is left at home with his baby brother while his mother goes out shopping. She has told him to give the baby his bottle while she is away. However, the boy has a different idea about what he should do, and consumes most of the bottle himself. The hungry baby's cries arouse the neighbors to try and get into the apartment, but it is locked, and the four-year old can't (or, more likely, won't) let them in. Despite a number of near-disasters, the enterprising young boy manages things just well enough (with the occasional help of shouted advice from frantic neighbors) so that serious calamities are avoided.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aPaGAouuBMXAuhfBz5Rwsd6rfkW.jpg", "actors": ["Mahnaz Ansarian (Amir Mohammad)", "Abbas Jafari ()", "Amir Mohammad Pourhassan ()", "Emad Taheri ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
