Safaa Fathy filmed the reflections of the sky on the liquid surface at the pace of one second every half-hour, from morning to evening every day. Time passes and leaves its mark on fixed shots. The voice of Jacques Derrida reads a poem written by Safaa Fathy, translated from the Arabic by Zeinad Zaza and Derrida himself.
