Most of the people that know her, know her as a man. Fearing complete rejection from society, Oxana is forced to lead a double life by conforming her gender expression to the sex in which she was assigned at birth, although she doesn\u2019t identify that way. Trying to escape the complex circumstances she is caught up in, Oxana pushes social and personal boundaries in a transphobic country like Moldova. It's on the rare occasion, typically at night, that she dares to go out dressed in a manner she feels most comfortable. When her cross-dressing friend was invited to DJ at a local queer party, Oxana decided to attend the event for the first time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kYoS8WhckgM4Z32oYxND4rXZiul.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
