Adiza, who has been living well in France, has decided that she will return and buy the plantation she and her compatriots were expelled from, and enlists some unlikely helpers to bring them back into the country and enact their plot. Meanwhile, these \"local\" blacks are unwittingly accepted by the other landowners as more cheap labor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vtG5jfzzDEbDZSPV3BplGcgYZu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
