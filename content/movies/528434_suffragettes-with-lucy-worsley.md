The fight for the vote was about much more than just the Pankhurst family or Emily Davidson's fateful collision with the king's horse. In this film, Lucy Worsley is at the heart of the history drama, alongside a group of less well known, but equally astonishing, young working-class suffragettes who decided to go against every rule and expectation that Edwardian society had about them. Lucy explores the actions of these women as their campaign becomes more and more dangerous, while their own words are delivered in simple but strikingly emotive pieces of dramatised testimony. Lucy also tells this story from a range of iconic original locations, from the Houses of Parliament and 10 Downing Street to the Savoy Hotel, and has access to an amazing range of artefacts, from hunger-striking medals to defused bombs and private letters between the government and the press.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qX9YoOrk21xbOqa4FFI0PT0ofrp.jpg", "actors": ["Lucy Worsley (Herself)", "Amy Gavin (Annie Kenney)", "Joanne Thomson (Mary Leigh)", "Kate Burdette (Mary Richardson)", "Lucinda Davidson (Lilian Lenton)", "Ayse Jamieson (Flora Drummond)", "Tara Breathnach (Emmeline Pankhurst)", "Mairi Phillips (Christabel Pankhust)", "Alexandra Donnachie (Sylvia Pankhurst)", "Ellie Goffe (Suffragette 1)", "Lucy Kilpatrick (Suffragette 2)", "Edwin Flay (Inspector Jarvis)", "Richard Shanks (Inspector Wells)", "Tom Ashley (Arthur Barrett)", "Giles Stoakley (Prison Doctor)", "Seamus Casey (Chief Insp.
