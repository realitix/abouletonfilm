For generations, the Badjao were oceanic nomads, living in harmony with the sea as fishermen and free divers. Nowadays, however, only a few Badjao remain, like Alexan, who still remembers the old ways. He hopes to pass his knowledge along to his ten-year-old nephew Sari, but time and opportunities are running out. Sari loves the sea, but it can only offer a hard life of subsistence fishing, while the nearby tourist resort sings a siren song of easy money.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kurb3iKlY8A9jsoxUeLvPYEaw1Q.jpg", "actors": ["Sari ()", "Sari ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
