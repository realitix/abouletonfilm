It is the 1970s and the young people in charge of the place are heavily into flower power, sitar music and solving problems by frank talk sessions with the delinquents. However, the hippies, who themselves despise authority, soon find their own authority under attack by the rebellious youngsters, especially after the arrival of a mysterious young girl. Then a violent incident occurs that will have a decisively detrimental effect on relations at the institution.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3EuZMWzuVKYgvXj9ldUJroNRAU5.jpg", "actors": ["Hilmir Sn\u00e6r Gu\u00f0nason ()", "Atli Rafn Sigur\u00f0sson ()", "J\u00f6rundur Ragnarsson ()", "\u00deorsteinn Bachmann (Keli)", "Tinna Hrafnsd\u00f3ttir ()", "\u00der\u00f6stur Le\u00f3 Gunnarsson ()", "Helgi Bj\u00f6rnsson ()", "Elma L\u00edsa Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir ()", "J\u00f3hann Sigur\u00f0arson ()", "Baltasar Breki Samper ()", "Brynd\u00eds Jakobsd\u00f3ttir ()", "Ragnhildur G\u00edslad\u00f3ttir ()", "Hera Hilmar ()", "\u00de\u00f3rey Birgisd\u00f3ttir ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
