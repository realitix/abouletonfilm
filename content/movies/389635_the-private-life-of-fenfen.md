In 2007, the filmmaker gave Fenfen\u2014a feisty young migrant worker in southern China\u2014a video camera with which to start filming her epic video diary. In the film, however, fragments of Fenfen's video life\u2014constructed out of over 100 hours of footage\u2014are broadcast \"live\" on TV in various migrant worker locations across China. Inside cheap restaurants, hole-in-the-wall cigarette shops, and alley hair salons, everyone is watching Fenfen and consuming her real life as would-be entertainment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kbtBu3wb5gxEToEXA8D85qESrYv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "F1RJaYewUnc"}
