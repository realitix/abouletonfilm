After discovering the seal, Clint goes mad. He then tells his tenant he can't keep Alvin (the seal) because no animals are allowed. A man looking for a circus act visits the tenant, and is not highly impressed by the seal, until Clint chases Alvin. The man then wants to sign the seal and Clint as a \"clown with seal\" act. Alvin doesn't want to work with Clint and she moves to another flat with its owner. Clint is upset, because he thinks he could have been a \"clown superstar\".", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
