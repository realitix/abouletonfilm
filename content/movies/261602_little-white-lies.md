James and based on the play 'Flesh and Blood' by Helen Griffin, 'Little White Lies' deals with the paranoia of racism, the politics of hate and how these things threaten to tear one family apart. The father is an armchair politician who never leaves the house, the daughter has a new boyfriend that she won't bring home to meet her parents and the son has just become an active member of the BNP. The only person in the family trying to hold it all together is the mother, who just wants everyone to get along.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/46Eda49ycZBOwKrCEcI5fEwd5hW.jpg", "actors": ["Helen Griffin (Helen)", "Brian Hibbard (Tony)", "Sara Lloyd-Gregory (Serena)", "Jonny Owen (Steve)", "Mark Lewis Jones (Dr. James)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "zqNGH6C11zE"}
