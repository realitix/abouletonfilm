This marked the end of her disagreement with the director, which arose during the making of this film, some 35 years ago now. The charming director doesn't seem like the kind of man you can stay angry with for long. Wan Pipel turned out to be a watershed in the career of this headstrong filmmaker, who shook up the Dutch film world in the late 1960s. Although he went on to fight back with his so-called \"minimal movies,\" he would never again get the opportunities his talent and inventiveness deserved. In Parradox In-Soo Radstake provides a personal portrait of De la Parra, now 70 years of age, who after many adventures in the Netherlands has returned to his native Suriname. He discusses the major themes of his life and work, which for a long time coexisted: too many women, too little money, too much ego.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eYNtJDfNC571PiTipedLHJWzLZD.jpg", "actors": ["Willeke van Ammelrooy (herself)", "Sylvia Kristel (herself)", "Paul Verhoeven (himself)", "Pim de la Parra (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
