The film charts Keane's musical progression from a four-piece guitar band to the three-piece piano-based group that they've become today, and shows how they went on from playing tiny gigs on the UK pub circuit, to winning 2 Brits awards and selling nearly 5 million albums around the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rzflAWLQUqByazkdmZ1dAnvIrS8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
