The famous portrait of Bach portrays a grumpy 62-year-old man in a wig and formal coat, yet his greatest works were composed 20 years earlier in an almost unrivalled blaze of creativity.  We reveal a complex and passionate artist; a warm and convivial family man at the same time a rebellious spirit struggling with the hierarchies of state and church who wrote timeless music that is today known world-wide. Gardiner undertakes a 'Bach Tour' of Germany, and sifts the relatively few clues we have - some newly-found.  Most of all, he uses the music to reveal the real Bach.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jpfDvfTRrrvShRdtH16sqZR49PJ.jpg", "actors": ["John Eliot Gardiner (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
