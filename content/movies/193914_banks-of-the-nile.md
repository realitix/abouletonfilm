Thanks to a rope and pulley system cows climb skywards then disappear into the hold of the sailing vessel. On the bank, black-haired women rock back and forth, bursting out laughing and showing the first signs of going into a state of trance. Never-before filmed gestures and faces of the people of the Nile succeed one another, uprooted to an unknown, magical world. The Banks of the Nile is one of the first experiments of film in colour that uses the Kinemacolor process.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/49mjVHu9tnrW1ui9YRt18MbFCSp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
