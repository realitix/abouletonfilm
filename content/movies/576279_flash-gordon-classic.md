There, the trio are quickly captured by the forces of Ming the Merciless. As Ming holds Dale captive, he sends Flash and Zarkov into the Tunnel of Terror, where they must engage in a gladiatorial battle against a giant monster. Flash uses a stone like a football to fend off the monster, but as it has him pinned to the ground with its claw, Princess Aura throws a ray gun, which Flash uses to kill the monster. Ming calmly reprimands his daughter for her actions, but she insists for him to keep Flash alive for her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ipoFYfesgPPQBEZMDUz3Cxk8x3V.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
