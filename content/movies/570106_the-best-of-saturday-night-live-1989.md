Wayne and Garth. Mike Myers knew his \"Wayne's World\" was big, but it wasn't until Aerosmith came to Saturday Night Live as a musical guest in February 1990 and all but demanded to be included in a WW sketch, that he knew just how big.\r Wayne and Garth and Aerosmith.

By '89, after three years together, this generation of SNL'ers had rooted a forest of catch phrases and characters into the pop landscape.\r Check out the response here to Dana Carvey's Church Lady.
