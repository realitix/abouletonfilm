Street congestion, air pollution, and rail traffic were all the negative results of a city that had grown without being properly planned. French architect and urban designer Jacques Gr\u00e9ber stepped in to create a far-sighted plan for the future development of Ottawa. With tracks moved, factories relocated, and neighbourhoods redesigned as separate communities, Ottawa became the capital city of true beauty and dignity we know today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/db2XFBwwvIAVELhErf2mSYSEpx0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
