The band played every song on the double album except \"Good Night\", which was played over the P.A. at the end of the set (\"Birthday\" was covered as an instrumental, during which Fishman presented a birthday cake to Brad Sands, the band's road manager). Before the band took the stage for their second set, the sound technician began playing \"Speak to Me\" over the PA, leading the audience to believe the band was about to play Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon. However, just at the moment \"Breathe\" would have begun, the recording immediately cut to a sample of Ed Sullivan introducing The Beatles from their famous February 9, 1964 appearance on his show. The band promptly leapt into \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7fNCYLjYEkuYZs59r1wDi1uKHN4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
