MacGillvary interviews a number of the artists that were formative to the program. Many of whom would go on to become teachers at the school.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i2KSQ8Gygfj9RTvDhf9q4EthK1T.jpg", "actors": ["Dara Birnbaum ()", "Michael Snow ()", "Krzystof Wodiczko ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
