He was the first artist in Australia to animate cartoons for films. He successfully used caricature and satire to comment on the social, political and economic impact of World War One \u2013 from the Allies point of view. Julius's drawn animation regularly includes the appearance of animals representing the major war countries including: a battered fez-capped turkey (Turkey); a large aggressive eagle (the United States); and a Union Jack-covered bulldog or lion (the United Kingdom).", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
