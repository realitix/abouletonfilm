In REVOLUTION, Margaret tackles the axis of evil, her travels through Thailand's red light district, the explosion of child birth, bartering sex for household chores, revolutionizing one's self-esteem, the joy of bodily functions, her loser ex-boyfriend, and of course, her now world-famous mother. Known as much for her social activism as she is for her raunchy humor, Margaret is a one-of-a-kind phenomenon who once again brings her distinctive and empowering personal voice to her devoted and adoring fans.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Dgslz2lcHcn16AD8v1XDqpt3Ib.jpg", "actors": ["Margaret Cho (Herself)", "Bruce Daniels (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
