At the core of this film is a dramatic recreation of Kandinsky's account of returning to his studio one dark evening, and being astonished by an unknown masterpiece of abstract art leaning against the easel - a picture which turned out to be one of his own landscapes fallen on its side. 'Now I knew for certain that the object spoiled my pictures.' While this film's narration does indeed emphasize the notion of an inspired breakthrough to Abstraction, the picture it conveys in more purely filmic ways is a rich and complex one.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f46nz1kWiVBrGh35BzkG07vmGo1.jpg", "actors": ["Susanne Carwin (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
