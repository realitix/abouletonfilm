However, things are more complicated than they seemed for Farah soon discovers that there are two problems that she has to resolve: caring and providing for her and her sister and finding a new place to stay as their current home is rented after her mother sold their old home in order to allow Farah to study in Melbourne, which is now too expensive for her to pay by herself. A silver lining comes in the form of her mother\u2019s will that informs her that they are still in possession of her mother\u2019s first house, which she deemed was a good investment due to its strategic location among the upper class, but has failed to be sold due to the fact that the place is haunted. The two sisters move in, but strange things start to happen", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9IM6gi49T8Eg6FAiArAsObUFNIA.jpg", "actors": ["Tasya Kamila (Rika)", "Gilang Dirgahari (Arman)", "Chintami Atmanegara (Tante Anti)", "Chintami Atmanegara (Tante Anti)", "Medina (Sabrina)", "Medina (Sabrina)", "Ki Kusumo (Pak Hadi)", "Iszur Muchtar (Calon pembeli rumah)", "Rina Nose (Calon pembeli rumah)", "Daus Separo (Pegawai PLN)", "Sonia Wibisono (Dokter)", "Shandy Aulia (Farah)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
