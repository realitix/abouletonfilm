The only thing missing from his life is a good woman to share it with. But after dating a string of nightmarish women from gold diggers to ditzes, he begins to wonder if finding Mrs. Right is even possible anymore. Enter Alexandra (Romi Rain)- a stunningly beautiful attorney that is now being considered for the promotion that Martin was actually next in line for. Thrown into a tailspin, Martin tries to upstage his competition, but her cut-throat charm and razor-sharp wit quickly turn his world upside down and before long he's left wondering if the woman stealing his job - might also be stealing his heart.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rK1eJhi8BlnVb0DEn5WZyBJGqTB.jpg", "actors": ["Romi Rain (Alex)", "Anikka Albrite (Daphne)", "Jessa Rhodes (Mariel)", "Aaliyah Love (Melanie)", "Ryan McLane (Martin)", "Mick Blue (Christian)", "Logan Pierce (Simon)", "Van Wylde (George)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
