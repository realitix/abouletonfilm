P. Eagle\" years). Bobby Driscoll plays a young boy who feels neglected and misunderstood at home. Preparing to run away, Bobby chances across an old diary once kept by his grandfather (Charley Grapewin). Leafing through the yellowed pages, Bobby discovers that grandpa went through many of the same childhood travails that Bobby is enduring at that moment--and look how well gramps turned out! Armed with a renewed understanding of (and appreciation for) his elders, Bobby decides to stick around for a while and see how things develop.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f3sGRAtYCkvrOmKnSPVozIVtYpf.jpg", "actors": ["Bobby Driscoll (Josh / Danny Reed)", "Robert Preston (Father Reed)", "Martha Scott (Mother Reed)", "Sherry Jackson ()", "Sherry Jackson (Ruthie Reed)", "Johnny McGovern (Duckface Kelly)", "Frances Chaney (Mrs. Kelly (as Frances Cheney))", "Poodles Hanneford (Bobo)", "Ralph Dumke (Carp)", "Paul Guilfoyle (Doc)", "Paul Levitt (Carp's Assistant)", "Griff Barnett (Dr. Bailey)", "Margaret Lloyd (Volunteer Nurse)", "Charley Grapewin (Grandpa Reed)", "Harry Morgan (Father Reed (modern))", "Elisabeth Fraser (mother reed)", "Robert Hyatt (Binks (as Bobby Hyatt))", "Hamilton Camp (Bully)", "Ruth Lee (Bully's Mother)", "Donald Gordon (Harmonica Boy)", "Robert Gordon (Boy with Water Trough)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
