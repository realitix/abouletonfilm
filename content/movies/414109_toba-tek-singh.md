Situated in Lahore, it was home to Hindu, Muslim and Sikh patients who were left behind by their uncaring families. Friendships were thick between the patients who had nobody but each other for company. Each had a story that made for an interesting tale but none quite like Bishan Singh.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8S7KB4Bzaag1f3JY4vvB2QmyxeG.jpg", "actors": ["Pankaj Kapur ()", "Vinay Pathak ()", "Gaurav Dwivedi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [405047], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
