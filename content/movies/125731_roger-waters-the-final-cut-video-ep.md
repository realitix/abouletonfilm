Scottish actor Alex McAvoy, who played the teacher in the film version of The Wall, had a prominent role in the video EP. Waters appears (though all but his mouth is silhouetted) as a patient singing the lyrics to a psychologist on the grounds of the Fletcher Memorial Home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/foxXb52vKLJyfTwAJpI7ngc52It.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
