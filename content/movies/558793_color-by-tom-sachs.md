Seen through the eyes of Van Neistat, from the film-making duo Neistat Brothers, Sachs presents a comprehensive manual for color use, appropriately titled COLOR. Starring the Sachs and company studio, this informative piece will surely bring the fascinating science of color back into perspective.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5qrKP6GStU8nP3unUciIEAfDW9U.jpg", "actors": ["Hugo Nathan (Narrator (Intro))", "Arsun Sorenti (Narrator (White))", "Van Neistat (Narrator (Green) / Narrator (Yellow) / Narrator (Red) / Narrator (Orange) / Narrator (Black))", "Carrie Jackson (Narrator (Blue))", "Samantha Ratanarat (Narrator (Orange))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "eBM_9W_e_D4"}
