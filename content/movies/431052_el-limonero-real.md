Wenceslao (Germ\u00e1n de Silva of Las acacias and Wild Tales) blames himself for his son\u2019s death six years prior, but attempts to get his still-grieving wife to attend her sister\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve party; she refuses, even after her nieces and other sisters join in the effort. Throughout, DP Diego Poleri captures the golden-hued radiance of the river during the day as spellbindingly as he does the charcoal-tinted night. -from http://www.filmlinc.org/", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wjCJbaRsk1yufFctBFxTi8L90lM.jpg", "actors": ["Eva Bianco ()", "Germ\u00e1n de Silva ()", "Rosendo Ru\u00edz ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
