In Chelsea Girls with Andy Warhol, Auder captures revealing moments in Warhol's public and private life: the opening of the 1970 Whitney Museum retrospective, a party held at John Lennon and Yoko Ono's home, a heated telephone conversation between Warhol, Viva and Brigid Berlin, and an illuminating interview conducted with Larry Rivers, the grandfather of Pop Art, following the publication of The Philosophy of Andy Warhol in 1975. The issue of money is a consistent topic of conversation with Viva, who after departing the Factory in 1969 sent Warhol a series of threatening letters demanding money.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Brigid Berlin ()", "John Lennon ()", "Yoko Ono ()", "Viva ()", "Andy Warhol ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
