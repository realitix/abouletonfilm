Faced with the prospect of losing the family farm, Dionne convinces her mother (a witch) to cast a spell upon next year's crop. The crop is such a success that Joe hires some college students to help them harvest. However, when a nosy neighbor begins poking around in the fields, he finds out more than he bargained for. Now the question isn't how to best harvest the crop, it's how to keep from being harvested!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gZoK3wf4vt55vUahVHvOrtQfAtO.jpg", "actors": ["Christine Egan (Dionne)", "H.
