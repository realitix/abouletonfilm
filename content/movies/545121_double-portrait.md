{"tmdb_id": 545121, "title": "Double Portrait", "original_title": "Double Portrait", "slug_title": "double-portrait", "date": "1987-01-01", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "\"Double Portrait\" and \"I Love You\" are a paired piece with Akiko Iimura. Both Iimuras play individually as well as a unit. In \"Double Portrait\" they are never together, but one by one in three points of view, front, side, and back, assigned to the words \"I\", \"You\" and \"He/She\" respectively. The pronouns rotate with every repetition, for instance, in front view with \"You\", then \"He/She\" and back to \"I\". Often the words are destroyed acoustically making them unintelligible. \"I Love You\" is not a style of confession, but the words, and a linguistic  practice using a sentence and shifting the pronouns.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nnYjqHAxbKslY0hOPOxzeEirZ9u.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
