Tangerine throws lavish parties at her sumptuous seaside home for influential business executives. What she is really up to, however, has more to do with dollars than hospitality. Her bait, Faith, Hope, and Charity, who pretend to be between the ages of 13 and 15, are actually not teenagers at all, and are no relation to Tangerine whatsoever!  It's a good, spicy tale and a provocative experience, as you follow the three nymphettes in their erotic seduction.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uhCVmyNPSrbfDk6bfGclGwQt4Nk.jpg", "actors": ["Jennifer West (Tangerine)", "Holly McCall (Faith)", "Lori Blue (Hope)", "Angel Ducharme (Charity)", "Michael Morrison (Hammersmith)", "Richard Pacheco (Haley)", "Harry Freeman (Nichols)", "Mike Horner (Eckerman)", "Mike Ranger (Steele)", "Juliet Anderson (Aunt)", "Charles Hooper (Tim)", "Ken Scudder (Williamson)", "Blair Harris (Logan)", "Jane Lindsay (Trio in Shower)", "Kitty Shayne (Trio in Shower)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
