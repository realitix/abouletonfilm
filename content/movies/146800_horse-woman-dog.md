At heart, the film is an extremely perverse rural Gothic reminiscent of Western '70s films like Pets and Dvaergen, in which a necrophilic man lives in a secluded house with a female amnesiac and a woman who murdered her sister. Sato centers his attention on the psycho-sexual deterioration of his protagonists, while Shintoho publicity played on star Kanako Kishi's outrageous sex scenes with canine and equine \"lovers,\" ensuring that an otherwise routine film became a minor succ\u00e8s de scandale.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/azRCUDxSwYAV22rqlBlahxrvkPS.jpg", "actors": ["Kanako Kishi (Y\u016bko Hayakawa)", "Takahiko Kobayashi (Shin Kijima)", "Kazuhiro Sano (Akira Migita)", "Yuri Sasaski (Maki Yano)", "Emi Uehara (Norie Kiyama)", "Tatsuya Takahashi (Akihisa Tsuda)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
