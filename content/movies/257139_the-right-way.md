With no real aim in mind, the bear and the rat bungle along in a folk tale of their own devising, wondering what they should do and where they should go, enjoying nature together, foraging for sustenance, getting lost, squabbling, joking and making music along the way. Both monumental and intimate, serious and hilarious, The Right Way suggests how any way \u2013 whether straight, crooked or both \u2013 may be made into the right one.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8gto4gR29XtHy4PBoOLBilOftRn.jpg", "actors": ["Alfred Pfeifer ()", "Ingold Wildenauer ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
