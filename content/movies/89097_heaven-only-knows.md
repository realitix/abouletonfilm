Hard-bitten gambling boss Brian Donlevy rules his frontier community with brawn and bullets. To his dismay, Donlevy discovers that he has a guardian angel (Robert Cummings), who shows up in the guise of an Eastern tenderfoot. The angel has been sent from Above to save Donlevy's soul, and to that end encourages the one-time villain to squire a minister's daughter (Jorja Curtwright) rather than his usual dance-hall girls. Donlevy is also given tips on winning against his enemies without resorting to gunplay. The gambler finally redeems himself with Heaven by rescuing the angel from a lynch mob (how can you lynch an angel?) Heaven Only Knows deserves an \"E\" for Effort for bringing a fresh twist to the venerable western genre.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uXiZqLubIGUtlJ3ylnAi4zP9YWV.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Cummings (Michael, aka Mike)", "Brian Donlevy (Adam 'Duke' Byron)", "Marjorie Reynolds (Ginger 'The Copper Queen')", "Jorja Curtright (Drusilla Wainwright)", "Bill Goodwin (Bill Plumber)", "John Litel (Reverend Wainwright)", "Stuart Erwin (Sheriff Matt Bodine)", "Gerald Mohr (Treason)", "Edgar Kennedy (Judd)", "Lurene Tuttle (Mrs. O'Donnell)", "Peter Miles (Speck O'Donnell)", "Will Orleans (Kansas City Kid (as Will Orlean))", "Ray Bennett (Lawyer Creel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
