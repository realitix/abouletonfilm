Set in Paris, Otto and Leo both fall in love with Gilda. She cannot make up her mind which man she loves, so the three decide to live together in a platonic friendship. Among Coward's trademark sparkling wit, the play explores deeper themes including infidelity, the pressures of fame on an unstable mind, and morality (or immorality) of a menage a trois.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Rula Lenska (Gilda)", "Clive Arrindell (Otto)", "John Steiner (Leo)", "John Bluthal (Ernest Friedman)", "Dandy Nichols (Miss Hodge)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
