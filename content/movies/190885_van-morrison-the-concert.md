Recorded in New York the previous year, the concert featured two special guests and long-time friends Mose Allison and John Lee Hooker, each of whom performed some of their own songs. This video mainly consisted of Morrison's work from his last two albums; including four songs from both Avalon Sunset and Irish Heartbeat.[1] The video also features jazz singer Georgie Fame on Hammond organ. Some reviewers have stated that Van Morrison was not in best shape during the concert, his voice was probably strained by a cold.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gBDUr3Ywa7a2kZvsBYXrTCs5s7Q.jpg", "actors": ["Van Morrison (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
