Andrei agrees. On the journey, away from Nadia\u2019s harsh father, he plans to tell her that he wants to file for a divorce. But nature interferes with their plans. Because of the rain, the water in the river rises, blocking the ways home. In search for a crossing, Andrei and Nadia get lost in the depth of the Siberian taiga.
