Built in the 1920s as  a holiday home for Welsh coalminers' sons, boasting a pool, sports yards and even a chapel of its own. Not much remains of its former glory, though. Shattered glass and debris are all over the place; graffiti on the walls. There are countless trap falls and opportunities for injury. A parent's nightmare, it can be heaven on earth for a certain kind of child. It more or less is for Kevin. He has been eleven years old for quite some time now. Has it been years or decades?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/idOeLCHRPD3F51LBzMHQU8aUTHj.jpg", "actors": ["Benjamin Thorne (Kevin)", "Andrew McQueen (Alex)", "Hannah-Rose Jones (Brenda)", "Jack Jones ()", "Wain Collins ()", "Ryan Ellis ()", "Jon Pountney ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
