We get all the nostalgic cliche's, the Drive ins, the Pool Parties, Lover's Lane and the endless car cruising and of course the Beach and the sexy horse play. The Last Surfer is an erotic time machine that will take you back to a much different simpler time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bo85uYVtiDL9H7VzE4Af4bvkm7w.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Cambrose (Paul)", "Michael Christopher (Ace)", "Steve Douglas (Teacher)", "Claudette Folger (Mother)", "Jeff Folger (Clinton)", "Daniel Holt (Poco)", "Stefen Peach (Toosh)", "Tony Roco (Pee-Pee)", "Tad Ryan ()", "Jake Scott (The Last Surfer)", "Kathi Stewart (Linda)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
