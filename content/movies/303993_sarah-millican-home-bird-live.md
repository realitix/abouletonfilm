Performing to her home crowd at the Newcastle Tyne Theatre, the British Comedy Award's Queen of Comedy is giving up the party scene (Ann Summers), easing off on the drinking (fizzy pop equals wealthy dentists) and is settling down (taking her bra off). Determined to put down some roots, she now has cats (furry babies) and even a tree (she has a lot of mugs).  On this, her third live DVD, you will learn what to take on a dirty weekend, the right amount of meals to have in a day and how to teach a pensioner to swear. Join her for some hilarious domestic bliss.  \"Sarah Millican is never less than belly-laugh hilarious\"--The Mirror  \"An iron fist in a marigold glove.\"--The Guardian", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yzeAHl6dCGuK4HJbI9XAIENZxU1.jpg", "actors": ["Sarah Millican (Herself)", "Phil Creswick (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [142385, 79310], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
