A cosmic battle between gods and demons reaches stalemate when the sage Shukracharya (Adajania) instantly restores every fallen demon to life. The god Indra (Baburao), on advice from Brahaspati (Vyas), sends Kacha (Bhagwandas) to the sage to learn his magic secret. Shukracharya's daughter, Devayani (Gohar) likes Kacha and the latter is accepted as the sage's disciple. The demon Vrisha Parva (Thatte) tries to kill Kacha but the youth is rescued by Devayani until the demons succeed in dissolving Kacha's body in alcohol and make Shukracharya drink the brew. Shukracharya then teaches Kacha the secret chant so that when he dies and Kacha emerges from his stomach, Kacha may bring him back to life again. Kacha's duties now conflict with a love-triangle, as Devayani marries Yayati who lives Sharmistha (Kamala).", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Gohar ()", "Kamala ()", "Dinshaw Bilimoria ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
