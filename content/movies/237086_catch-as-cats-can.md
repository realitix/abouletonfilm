The parrot spots Sylvester, foraging through the trash. Telling the cat he needs more vitamins (which the canary has been swallowing in bulk), he lures the cat inside to snare the canary. The straightforward approach fails (the canary bops him in the nose). He carves a female canary from soap, lures Frankie there; the birds slide down a greased counter, into the sink, and down the drain, but only the soap bird goes through the pipe and down Sylvester's throat. A trail of birdseed into the garage seems to work, but Frankie jacks Sylvester's mouth open. Sylvester laces the vitamins with buckshot; like all cartoon magnets, his attracts everything metal in sight except his prey.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9XmeMILzV2Qw22wmmoQf8UfSskG.jpg", "actors": ["Mel Blanc (Sylvester (voice))", "Richard Bickenbach (Bing Crosby Parrot (voice) (uncredited))", "Dave Barry (Various (voice) (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
