There he finds a friend in a man who calls himself Igor and he begins a love-affair with the deafmute Lena. Around Max' relationship to his father, Igor and Lena, losely held episodes give a many fasetted portrait of Leningrad and its inhabitants. In the eyes of the returning Max, the city is at once well-known and foreign. Lyrically saturated images and sophisticated editing contributes to making the film an expressive description of a changing city.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Mikhail Dementyev ()", "Gregory Hlady ()", "Igor Kechaev ()", "Natalya Kolyakanova ()", "Cristin K\u00f6nig ()", "Nikita Mikhajlovsky ()", "Gennadi Mitrofanov ()", "Georgiy Teykh ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
