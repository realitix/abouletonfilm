But he wouldn\u2019t wish this upon anybody. Having grown up in the remote Khumbu region of Nepal, Apa was forced to leave school and work as a porter at the age of 12. His dreams of being a doctor forever lost. It is a story all too common for the Sherpa people of Nepal, a story Apa aims to change with his work at the Apa Sherpa Foundation.  In this visually stunning short documentary, we follow young Pemba Sherpa, a young child who must walk six hours a day to attend school. Pemba\u2019s story is a present day reflection of Apa\u2019s past, one where the draw of being a high altitude porter conflicts with the dreams of Nepal\u2019s rural people, dreams made possible only through education and knowledge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dNwBLK7FSTbdAI3kX7VxEISILic.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "itHU2W7zzXs"}
