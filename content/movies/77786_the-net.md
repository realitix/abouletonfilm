From that thematic springboard, Dammbeck branches out omnidirectionally, segueing into a series of thematic riffs and variants on such marginally-related subjects as: the history of cyberspace, terrorism, utopian ideals, LSD, the Central Intelligence Agency, and Cuckoo's Nest author Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bXcpdS5KVXo0Q2lmDyYyrhhRdh2.jpg", "actors": ["Lutz Dammbeck (Himself)", "Eva Mattes (Narrator (voice))", "Tom Vogt (Narrator (voice))", "Stewart Brand ()", "John Brockman ()", "Butch Gehring ()", "David Gelernter ()", "Theodore John Kaczynski (Himself)", "Robert W.
