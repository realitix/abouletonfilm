Upping the ante from last year\u2019s LA LA LAND, this is a movie not to be missed as the platform has been raised with scenes of riding the historical streets of Quebec city, snowmobiling the vast glaciers of British Columbia, lapping many of the major parks in the USA and reflecting upon what one\u2019s mind would conceive as their own snowboarding lifestyle. With new tricks in the bag, stakes are high for this movie to be destined to open your eyes towards female snowboarding.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zKFqo8R4Gsry4asJWshHU35SQNA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
