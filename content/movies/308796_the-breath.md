Haida, once a famous private detective, is now down and out and running out of reasons to live. One day, while engaging in a group volunteer project to clean up a river, he loses what's left of his will to live and lets the water carry him away. He ends up rescuing a drowning man who alters his view of life totally. Soon he gets a job investigating the mysterious disappearance of a student who sent her mother a cryptic letter, \"Wait a bit, Mother. I'm sending my breath. It will arrive soon.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5yJFvvoTszlQY0tqqholT7qMjK2.jpg", "actors": ["Juro Kara ()", "Yoshio Harada ()", "Na Tang ()", "Ni Shu-Chun ()", "Haruko Wanibuchi ()", "T.C.
