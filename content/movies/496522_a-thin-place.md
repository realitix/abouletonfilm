Whilst seeking the truth to their present and past behaviour but driven by self-obsession and malevolent denial, far from leading to salvation, the road they actually travel leads them to a place from which they may never return. A place where the truth is more horrific than the lies they tell themselves. One person from a past that connects them both holds the key to their new place of captivity and that person is in no hurry to leave.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2tZfUD0pwpYU3US8fRyxCCTcail.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
