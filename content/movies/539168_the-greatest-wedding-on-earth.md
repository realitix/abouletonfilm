While the script by Eileen Chang cleverly uses the two regions' foods to bring out clash of cultures, the film's title already says that it is ultimately a heartwarming film about two decent men who must put petty arguments aside for their children's happiness.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Cheung Ching ()", "Kitty Ting Hao ()", "Christine Pai Lu-ming ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
