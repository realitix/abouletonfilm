This time, the focus is Rong Qui-yan (Chen Ping), a kung fu student turned dutiful wife whose life falls apart when her husband is murdered by a squad of government operatives led by the duplicitous Jin Gang-Feng (Lo Lieh). Qui-yan is forced to go into hiding as she plots her revenge and finds allies in fellow fugitive Ma Seng (Tsui Siu Keung) and ex-lover Wang-jun (Yueh Hua). Meanwhile, Jin Gang-Feng sends out an array of killers to track them down. Complicating things further is the fact that Qui-yan is pregnant and struggling to keep her unborn child safe while fighting her way to safety.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7h1wDp7zMLkIwctA3tVlQcfBnQ1.jpg", "actors": ["Chen Ping (Rong Qiu Yan/Bloody Hibiscus)", "Elliot Ngok (Wang Chun)", "Norman Chu (Ma Shen (as Hsu Hsiao-Chiang))", "Lo Lieh (Jin Gang Feng)", "Lam Fai-Wong (Jin Ren Ting)", "Johnny Wang Lung-Wei (Biao)", "Shaw Yin Yin (Jin Shao Zhi)", "Wai Wang (Emperor)", "Lee Sau-Kei (Scholar Wan)", "Lee Chung-Ling (Official Han Tian De)", "Wong Ching-Ho (Tong Bei Hai)", "Keung Hon (Feng's assassin impersonating Hai)", "Chiang Nan (Court official at book burning)", "Wang Han-Chen (Jin Sheng Tan, executed bookstore boss)", "Gam Tin-Chue (Witness at execution)", "Lee Pang-Fei (Flying Gullotine's 1st victim)", "Yuen Biao (Flying Guillotine at bamboo trees)", "Corey Yuen (Flying Guillotine at bamboo trees)", "Ku Feng (Flying Guillotine)", "Ting Tung (Servant)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [75843, 108510, 107897, 125561], "youtube_key": "72KNpZqozCk"}
