Only thing that can be fair in this world is your **HEART** !!\r\n\r\nThough **Daniel Day Lewis'** character is not your typical role model from the start, you know that the Heart within isn't black (more so from a scene just before he says 'In all my godforsaken life, I've never known what it was to kill somebody until now')..The transformation of Day Lewis' character from a man who wasn't responsible enough to take care of himself to a man who vows to fight for his father's name is brilliantly heartwarming!\r\n\r\nIt just pains me to see how cruel 'WE' as a species can be to not accept our mistakes, even when we know that it can make someone's life miserable than HELL!!\r\n\r\nIn all the movie is good till the time you don't think of it as someone's life being played out in front of you.As soon as you realize that,it transforms into something you cant just think of as just another brilliant movie.Instead your heart goes out to the people who actually had to go through all this..\r\n\r\nWell directed, superbly acted, brilliant,heart breaking and heart warming at the same time !!\r\n\r\nThose who found it beautiful can go for Hillary Swank's 2010 movie **Conviction** as their next choice of another heartwarming 'eye treat' !"}], "recommandations_id": [10161, 903, 3090, 968], "youtube_key": "H0ff5KjZ7vM"}
