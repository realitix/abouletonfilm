Evey Hammond ne veut rien oublier de l'homme qui lui sauva la vie et lui permit de dominer ses peurs les plus lointaines. Mais il fut un temps o\u00f9 elle n'aspirait qu'\u00e0 l'anonymat pour \u00e9chapper \u00e0 une police secr\u00e8te omnipotente. Comme tous ses concitoyens, trop vite soumis, elle acceptait que son pays ait perdu son \u00e2me et se soit donn\u00e9 en masse au tyran Sutler et \u00e0 ses partisans. Une nuit, alors que deux \"gardiens de l'ordre\" s'appr\u00eataient \u00e0 la violer dans une rue d\u00e9serte, Evey vit surgir son lib\u00e9rateur. Et rien ne fut plus comme avant. Son apprentissage commen\u00e7a quelques semaines plus tard sous la tutelle de \"V\". Evey ne conna\u00eetrait jamais son nom et son pass\u00e9, ne verrait jamais son visage atrocement br\u00fbl\u00e9 et d\u00e9figur\u00e9, mais elle deviendrait \u00e0 la fois son unique disciple, sa seule amie et le seul amour d'une vie sans amour...", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8rI9pNiTmugkEbI249evLygl9TC.jpg", "actors": ["Natalie Portman (Evey Hammond)", "Hugo Weaving (V / William Rookwood)", "Stephen Rea (Chief Inspector Eric Finch)", "Stephen Fry (Gordon Deitrich)", "John Hurt (Chancellor Adam Sutler)", "Tim Pigott-Smith (Creedy)", "Natasha Wightman (Valerie Page)", "Rupert Graves (Dominic)", "Roger Allam (Lewis Prothero)", "Ben Miles (Dascomb)", "Sin\u00e9ad Cusack (Delia Surridge)", "Eddie Marsan (Etheridge)", "John Standing (Bishop Lilliman)", "Imogen Poots (Young Valerie Page)", "Clive Ashborn (Guy Fawkes)", "Emma Field-Rayner (Guy Fawkes Lover)", "Ian Burfield (Tweed Coat Fingerman)", "Mark Phoenix (Willy Fingerman)", "Alister Mazzotti (Baldy Fingerman)", "Billie Cook (Little Glasses Girl)", "Guy Henry (Heyer)", "Cosima Shaw (Patricia)", "Megan Gay (BTN News Poppet)", "Roderic Culver (BTN News Poppet)", "Andy Rashleigh (Fred)", "Chad Stahelski (Storm Saxon)", "Antje Rau (Laser Lass)", "Amelda Brown (Wardrobe Mistress)", "Richard Campbell (Security Guard)", "Mark Longhurst (Little Glasses Girl Dad)", "Charles Cork (Barfly)", "John Ringham (Old Man)", "Oliver Bradshaw (Old Man)", "Juliet Howland (Middle Class Mum)", "Joseph Rye (Jones)", "Malcolm Sinclair (Major Wilson)", "Madeleine Rakic-Platt (Young Evey)", "Selina Giles (Evey's Mother)", "Carsten Hayes (Evey's Father)", "Derek Hutchinson (Bureaucrat)", "Martin Savage (Denis)", "Grant Burgin (Operator)", "Greg Donaldson (Operator)", "Jason Griffiths (Biology Teacher)", "Laura Greenwood (Sarah)", "Paul Antony-Barber (Valerie's Father)", "Anna Farnworth (Valerie's Mother)", "Mary Stockley (Ruth)", "Simon Newby (Tube Station News Poppet)", "David Merheb (Young Man)", "Dulcie Smart (Civil War News Poppet)", "Ben Posener (Water Shortage News Poppet)", "Ian T.

This was one of the early successes of the genre and it continues to shine today in ways other movies (I'm looking at you, Marvel) have not. \r\n\r\nThe grittiness of the story cannot be understated, this story is DARK. However, the message of the story is one of hope, and hope is a difficult thing to capture. This film captures both, with the help of excellent cinematography and slow-motion action cuts.\r\n\r\n I get the sense when I watch this film that something bigger is happening around me, and honestly in 2017, this movie feels more relevant than ever. Themes of state-run media empires, government corruption of the highest order, and the suffocation of all that is 'other' permeates the fabric of this film, and everything is captured beautifully in a noir-esque nightmarescape of future, facist London.\r\n\r\nI can honestly say that more than a decade later, this film still shines as one of the great comic book movies and its themes will continue to ring true as long as we have people in the world who exist to limit others. Let's just hope that someday this world does not feel any more real than it does now."}], "recommandations_id": [187, 604, 605, 197], "youtube_key": "ZR5xUl2Suew"}
