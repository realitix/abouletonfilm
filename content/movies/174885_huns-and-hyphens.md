He is a clumsy guy working in a restaurant and oddly, everyone who works in the place as well as many of the customers are Kaiser-loving spies. Why they would be headquartered in a restaurant in California, I have no idea! Regardless, their aim is to steal some plans from some old guy and his daughter. When Semon finds out, he comes to the rescue.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x96eFT890SdBtp0APYTukyw9y68.jpg", "actors": ["Larry Semon (Larry)", "Stan Laurel (Gang member)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
