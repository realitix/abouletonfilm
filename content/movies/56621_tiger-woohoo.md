As the only elder who knows \"Woohoo\" can no longer perform, his filial granddaughter put up a misleading advertisement which in turn attracts five youngsters from different backgrounds - bad-tempered bank security man Ah Beng, indecisive Char Kuey Teow hawker Ah Huat, effeminate designer Rain, university student Bobby and smart alec Alan - to be trained as 'woohoo' players. After some tough training, they finally look like a formidable team. However, few days before the anticipated festival day, the only 'tiger head\"'is accidentally destroyed by the mischievous kids in the village.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8zK5DYkUOllOT0J8GVOugdcUioG.jpg", "actors": ["Royce Tan ()", "Jack Lim ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
