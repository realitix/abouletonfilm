Big topics, but seen from a new and original perspective in a film based on a simple idea: that one's sense of time ceases to function when one dies, and that one for a short \u2013 or in fact very long \u2013 moment has the chance to experience eternity. And to therefore live in a single memory forever. Which one would you choose? 'I Remember When I Die' takes place at life's last destination, a hospice, but is a poetic and vital journey into the borderland of consciousness, and right into a possible afterlife.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aNXv92PbtCnsky1pX0zHVowEy9q.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
