Ever have a job that made you ponder \"this place would be fun if it didn't suck so much\"? Welcome to food-service hell. Natalie, the waitress, is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Her social life is in turmoil, and the endless barrage of customers just won't give her a break. Clint, the manager, isn't exactly a people-person. He's lewd, rude, and totally insensitive... until you get to know him. Kevin, the busboy, is a nice guy with a dark brooding secret. He's quirky and artistic, but don't light a match near this powder keg! Throw a couple of wise cracking trash-talkers and some inept thieves into the mix, and this is sure to be one night you'll never forget.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tg6mkLLjBe9qt9HwrVfVw6Hwwti.jpg", "actors": ["Kurt Finney (Clint Rockwell)", "Angela Trimbur (Natalie Pierce)", "Jason Arthur Russo (Lando)", "Ausby Larkin (Cracker)", "Christopher DeMaci (Mace)", "Appelusa McGlynn (Michelle)", "Hawk Younkins (Brad)", "La Donya M.
