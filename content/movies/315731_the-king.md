While she's in the throne room awaiting him, he's outside playing with guns, drilling his soldiers, and dallying with the wife of a new minister. The queen catches him kissing her, her husband figures out that something fishy is going on, and the king tries his best to proceed with his plans for a night out. The queen contrives to keep him cuffed in the bedroom: king, queen, minister, and coquette end up in a game of musical beds. Will his royal highness get his night out?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Harry Langdon (The King)", "Thelma Todd (The Queen)", "Dorothy Granger (Lady in Waiting (uncredited))", "Charles McAvoy (Guard (uncredited))", "Brad Michigan (The Guard (uncredited))", "James Parrott (Minor Role (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
