The multi-textured movie explores several themes, including mental illness, addiction, relationships, family dysfunction, and the struggle for artistic expression in the heart of America\u2019s \u201cBible Belt.\u201d  Centered on frontman Christopher Scum, Rebel Scum is, at its core, the story of one man\u2019s continued drive to create art in spite of the barriers imposed by society and his own self-destructive tendencies. Bouncing intermittently between the extremes of comedy and tragedy, the film reveals a seedy American underworld that is, at once, both fascinating and repulsive.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yazTIIlDvOBaFjCpSfDWsueVEvy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
