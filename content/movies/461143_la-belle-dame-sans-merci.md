La belle dame sans merci follows a famous actress who was once seduced and abandoned by a rich man and subsequently resolved to become a \u201cmerciless woman,\u201d forever scheming to hurt others (men in particular) in a ruthless yet captivating manner. Dulac challenges the Romantic archetype embodied in Keats\u2019s poem by way of symbolist mise en sc\u00e8ne, self-reflexive narration, and her typically associative approach to editing, locating a modern ambiguity within the stereotypical figures of 19th-century art.\" - Film Society of Lincoln Center", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Tania Daleyme (Lola de Sandoval)", "Yolande Hill\u00e9 (Ir\u00e8ne)", "Denise Lorys (Comtesse d'Amaury)", "Jean Toulout (Comte Guy d'Amaury)", "Jean Tarride (Hubert d'Amaury)", "Pierre Mareg (Marquis de Saint-\u00c9rasme)", "Lucien Glen (Lucien)", "Louis Monfils ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
