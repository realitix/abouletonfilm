When Perry's crew caught him and returned him to the mainland the ruling Shogunate put him under house arrest, a light sentence considering that the official penalty for leaving Japan was death. It was during his time of house arrest that Sh\u014din saw the whirlwind of foreign influence that Perry's visit had initiated. To try and counteract this Sh\u014din set up a school in his native Hagi in Yamaguchi Prefecture where he taught traditional Japanese values, military strategy and a redefinition of bushido, the samurai code. This school, the Shoka Sonjuku produced some of the leading revolutionaries who would bring about the downfall of the Shogunate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o5Nq8fqsJzwaG1ytDSq0u7SzVBE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
