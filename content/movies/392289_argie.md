The time is the summer of 1982, and the Falklands war is at hand when the young \"Argie\" follows a British woman home and is stopped from raping her only because she starts to speak to him in Spanish - that is one aspect of Blanco's unlikely premise, another is that the rapist and his potential victim enter into an ambivalent relationship, undecided as to whether they love or hate each other, or both. They end up on the streets when she is evicted and life becomes even less stable - parallels with the 10-week Falklands war and the general relationship between Britain and Argentina might be drawn, but this story focuses more on the couple and the Argentinian's attitude toward himself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yveUuNCkqcFdYKrmNF5snHmIdnf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
