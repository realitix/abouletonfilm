He has no job and hardly any friends. One night K\u00f4ichi meets Ryota at a bar which is also a sex club. Ryota came to Berlin to visit a German guy whom he had \"met\" on a dating app. His high hopes for romance (and marriage?) were quickly crushed since the German was only interested in sex, not even letting Ryota stay for the night. That is why Ryota ended up spending the night in the dark room of the sex club. K\u00f4ichi for some reason lets Ryota stay at his apartment. They have sex. Ryota goes out almost everyday to get laid by various local men and comes home to K\u00f4ichi's. Increasingly caught up with a strange feeling that is akin to but not quite frustration or curiosity (needless to say, it is not even close to love), K\u00f4ichi gradually gives himself up to sex with Ryota.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aH0yHU915NibzznpB2Zks2c6Z9O.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
