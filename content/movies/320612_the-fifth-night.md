The work recalls the narrative structure of a traditional Chinese hand-scroll, while its multiple perspectives are suggestive of an M. C. Escher drawing. The synchronous scene was captured in a single take, with the work running for 10 minutes and 37 seconds, the exact length of a reel of film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jJizLEawpqtJePsiLeUW18bu2Oc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
