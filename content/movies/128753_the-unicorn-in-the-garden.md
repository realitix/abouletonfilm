He rushes upstairs to inform his domineering wife, and she accuses him of being crazy and threatens to have him put away. He persists that he did see a unicorn in the garden, and she phones for the authorities to come take him away. But when they arrive, with strait-jackets, they find the wife rambling and raving about seeing the unicorn, and promptly take her away.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aPxXQ2iEXuc1T7Sek80ZYJxXNzC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [103956, 127408, 46990, 121159], "youtube_key": "1teJjX-smdE"}
