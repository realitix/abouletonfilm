They go on holiday to the Cederberg for a family reunion, which leads to plenty of surprises and reconciliation.  Hanna is an intelligent and imaginative young girl who's earned herself the nickname \"Hoekom,\" because she's forever questioning things. When her eccentric mother decides that the family \u2013 including her gay biological dad, actor stepfather, detestable half-brother and two stepbrothers \u2013 should spend their winter holiday in a remote house on a mountain, they end up stranded with nowhere to go and no-one to turn to except each other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kA74BtTI1hTJvEykMH9xrEHkImV.jpg", "actors": ["Anna-Mart van der Merwe (Mana)", "Gys de Villiers (Beyers)", "Anneke Weidemann (Hanna)", "Helene Lombard (Margot)", "Crystal-Donna Roberts (Sharon)", "Dawid van den Bergh (Yann)", "Christopher van der Westhuizen (Amos)", "Justin Carlse (Tibo)", "Peter Butler (Jonathan)", "Neels Venter (Hex)", "Megan Mathee (Baba)", "Tertius Meintjes (Gavin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
