He always longed to have his own church and jumps at the opportunity to become pastor of the impoverished Divine Faith Apostolic Church in Atlanta. His wife and two children aren\u2019t very enthusiastic about his assignment. Neither is the congregation itself, but they will have to learn to trust each other and pull together to save the church from a corrupt banker anxious to foreclose. It will take a musical miracle, supplied by BeBe Winans himself, to save them all in this heartfelt, family-friendly comedy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gkOFflh2V9Oo4r3YYB0dV3RdmYO.jpg", "actors": ["David A.R.
