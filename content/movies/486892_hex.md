As one is older and thus more experienced things are not equal between them, but the elder soldier underestimates the younger soldier's survival instinct in what leads to a cat and mouse game during which they discover they are not as alone as they thought and find themselves unable to leave the woods, trapped by a witch.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography in Hex is simply beautiful taking full advantage of lush woodland scenery and an old ruins. Re-enactment props and costumes give it an authentic look, combined with the scenery, beyond its means. The audio in this is truly amazing, from the slightest brush of tall grass to a crackle in a fire to a babble in a brook, the environment is full and crisp.\r\n\r\nThree incredibly talented actors bring to life a story tautly stretched in tension. The director keeps the mystery going making good use of the surroundings, the night, and of course the unknown. Fear and suspicion rule day and night for the soldiers, not only of an unseen enemy but of an unknown trust as to whether they could turn on each other at any moment. The tension plays out as thick as the tall grass in the meadows.\r\n\r\nThis is not a story of just a moment in history, as that is its adornment, but within is an allegory pertinent in our times that certainly provides something to think about and stays with you, for those who don't shrink away from it. Slow paced it is, and it could have used some trimming in my opinion, but beautiful and haunting throughout is what sight, sound and an open mind will reveal."}], "recommandations_id": []}
