On the day his beloved grandfather dies, he is charged with taking care of the elder's pet cat. The local town bully, Mourids however, has his own ideas on how to take care of the frisky feline and wastes no time with showing Jasper just what he thinks of cats. Enter Far, a significantly more mature girl who Jasper is attracted to. It's love at first sight for Jasper, but will Far return the puppy love or will Jasper find out the hard way that she is actually Mourid's girlfriend?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xJ8bfWevUY6W5nTUajr2DaiukyM.jpg", "actors": ["Benjamin Rothenborg Vibe (Jasper)", "Jannie Faurschou (Mor)", "S\u00f8ren \u00d8stergaard (Far)", "Patrick Ytting (Mourids)", "Ove Sprog\u00f8e (The Ghost)", "Kirsten Lehfeldt (Pr\u00e6stefruen)", "Stig Hoffmeyer (The Priest)", "Helle Fagralid (Beatrice)", "Mille Lehfeldt (Penelope)", "Birgit Sadolin (Museumsdamen)", "Peter Larsen ()", "Steen Svare ()", "Jytte Pilloni ()", "Jonas Bagger ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
