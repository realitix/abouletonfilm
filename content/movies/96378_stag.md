Just how Canadian is this movie? Well, there\u2019s a stripper, but she remains clothed for 99% of her screentime and the feature ends with a father reaffirming his love for his family. \u201cStag\u201d isn\u2019t exactly a raunchy explosion of men behaving badly, and it\u2019s not all that funny either. True to its Canadian heritage, it\u2019s mild stuff, hoping to come across triumphantly ill-mannered with erection jokes and the occasional curse word, missing a devilish spark that could amplify its tightly mittened tomfoolery to pleasing extremes."}], "recommandations_id": [191698, 222136, 14063, 102639]}
