Jim is also trying to make it with the woman of his dreams, Christine Callaghan (Keeley Hawes, Othello and Wives and Daughters), while simultaneously being pursued by the woman of his nightmares, fellow lecturer Margaret Peel (Helen McCrory, Anna Karenina).  One (of many) complications is that Christine is the girlfriend of Professor Welch's egotistical artist son, Bertrand. Another is that Margaret keeps attempting suicide to get Jim's attention. But despite his misadventures, Jim keeps his eyes on the prize: a leg up on the ladder to a professorship in medieval history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bYeMiD29eysH6KcRsOInlyaL7XP.jpg", "actors": ["Stephen Tompkinson (Jim Dixon)", "Robert Hardy (Professor Neddy Welch)", "Keeley Hawes (Christine Callaghan)", "Helen McCrory (Margaret Peel)", "Stephen Mangan (Bertrand Welch)", "Penelope Wilton (Celia Welch)", "David Ryall (Stanley)", "Anthony Calf (Cecil Goldsmith)", "Hermione Norris (Carol Goldsmith)", "Denis Lawson (Julius Gore-Urqhart)", "Robert Wilfort (Evan Johns)", "Hugh Parker (Beesley)", "Rick Warden (Mr. Catchpole)", "Ursula Jones (Mrs Cutler)", "Anthony Smee (Mr Pringle)", "Tim Wylton (Mr Wilson)", "Ian Lindsay (Bus Conductor)", "Dorian Lough (Taxi Driver)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
