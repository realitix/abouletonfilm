Nearly a decade in the making, this feature documentary chronicles the action both before and after the White Stripes rose to fame and brought an international spotlight on the scene. Beginning with the hugely influential 1980s trio The Gories (and stretching back to a legacy that includes The Stooges and The MC5), the bands of the Detroit garage rock music scene are known for two things: having an impeccable knowledge of the history of rock 'n' roll and putting on a raucous live show. It Came From Detroit documents the evolution of the Detroit scene from underground obscurity to international phenomenon. We watch how, as bands such as the White Stripes, the Von Bondies and the Electric Six started to develop a following overseas, journalists and fans around the world started hyping Detroit as \u201cThe Next Seattle\u201d -- before the whole thing nearly imploded on itself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mJcybI0PFwRsG2UPCjLqQ6VWipk.jpg", "actors": ["Wayne Kramer ()", "Jack White ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
