Different from other Chinese young people who prefer working in the cities, XIONG decided to go back to his hometown, Pingzhai Village in Yunnan Province, and started to plant the \"Red Rice Seed,\" a kind of ancient species.  The so-called organic agriculture has had an age-old tradition in China. The skills have been passed from generation to generation. This is the major reason why farmers connect to the land both historically and emotionally. The \"Red Rice Seed\" can only be planted in a traditional and organic way. If the plantation was to succeed, the problems resulted from scientific fertilizers and the overuse of chemicals since the 20th century can all be resolved.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qmU5E1WOR5g8XTZ4IcUQHWy8xi3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "1_GAtE0zXkM"}
