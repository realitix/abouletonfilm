Fiery Sarah O'Rourke rides the same coach, handcuffed to lawman Bill Speakes and headed for the hangman. In a few hours, all should reach their destinations. But the trail they travel takes an unexpected turn: Cooper and O'Rourke are soon off the stage and running for their lives. The law ends and the chase begins in a very alive tale of wanted-dead-or-alive fugitives (Linda Fiorentino and Craig Sheffer) pursued by a marshal (Sam Elliott) who's a law unto himself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1wH2QZv3aTBOmM7DMhpu1qK0pNp.jpg", "actors": ["Sam Elliott (Marshall Bill Speakes)", "Craig Sheffer (Jack Cooper)", "Linda Fiorentino (Sarah O'Rourke)", "Frank Whaley (Walter Cooper)", "John Furlong (Zeb Hollister)", "John Furlong (Mamie Hollister)", "Bradley Whitford (Tommy Donnelly)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "qt59aiSTI98"}
