For the novice skater just learning, there will be the inevitable bumps and falls. New skaters learn that their skate blades have an inside and outside edge. Basics they learn are how to glide properly and how to stop. Most maneuvers conducted by figure skaters are based on figure eights, figure threes and loops. Other areas of the arts and entertainment mesh with figure skating, such as music, fashion and dance. The most famous professional revue, the Ice Follies, incorporates many other aspects of entertainment into their show beyond the basic ice skating.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dtkwSE3OgGxGb9JYn53RV0rlGNn.jpg", "actors": ["Mae Ross (Herself)", "Pat Merifield (Herself)", "Phyllis Thompson (Herself)", "Sparky Bourque (Himself)", "Adolphe Hebert (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
