He returned to a ruined and destroyed Manisa in 1923. Bedevi started working at the Municipality as a fireman and a gardener. He became the pioneer and symbol of planting activities. Because of the soft climate of the area, he first wore a vest and trousers and then he started wandering about in the town in his shorts. The people of Manisa saw his resemblance to Tarzan because of his clothes, and always cherished him with love. Tarzan of Manisa lived in the mount Spilylus, ignoring all his individual needs but working for a greener environment. He died on 31st May, 1963. However, he has never been forgotten by the locals; on the contrary, he was immortalized for the things he did for Manisa and people followed his example.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pUjfcBETMBYBYNtqdm3hBk6HyGH.jpg", "actors": ["Talat Bulut (Ahmet Bedevi 'Manisa Tarzan\u0131')"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
