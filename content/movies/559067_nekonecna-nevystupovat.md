But in the early hours of the very first morning they are woken up by the loud sound of a trumpet. It is the severe supervisor of a nearby recreation center forcing the children out of their beds and out to exercise drill. To protect themselves from the children, Milan and Julo put up signs saying \"private property\". The first to disturb their privacy is the supervisor's little granddaughter Miluska, who uses their shed as her gingerbread house. The children in the camp are disgruntled, the supervisor's program bores them, and so they make up all sorts of other things to do.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mLZ08EcJkHGEsbMXjbira5U4bPj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
