She excels at school, is good on the springboard and is careful too. Her severely handicapped brother Kasper gets a lot of attention. Merel also has talent for singing. It is no surprise that she is asked for the school musical. But maybe Merel is a bit too convinced of herself. When people perform solos, she likes to sing along loudly. This doesn't fall on good ground though. People start ignoring her and she is getting bullied. All of the sudden Merel's life isn't that easy anymore, it will be hard to keep herself together.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hSstFi1FYHIaifaHjSsr3XjqGoW.jpg", "actors": ["Elske Rotteveel (Merel de Leeuw)", "Kees Scholten (Kasper de Leeuw)", "Elsie de Brauw (Mrs. De Leeuw)", "Jaap Spijkers (Mr. De Leeuw)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
