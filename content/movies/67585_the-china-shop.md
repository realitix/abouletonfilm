A demonic figure captures an upper-class lady and does battle with her lord, damaging much of the shop. But the demon proves to have a glass jaw and, literally, a yellow streak, and the happy couple is soon reunited. No dialogue, but some signs are in English, particularly the final punch-line.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jpKtLIcANyDGmCtiXNzG1jGdQcl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [66829, 67586, 39092, 57222], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
