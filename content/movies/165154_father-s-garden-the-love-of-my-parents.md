The mother irons shirts and regrets that the father never wears T-shirts. The father likes order, always knows best, and has everything under control. The mother prays and talks of her loneliness.

Alongside conversations that shift from slapstick to insanity and observations of daily life in his parents\u2019 cramped, lower middle class apartment, a puppet theatre is also established as a second location.
