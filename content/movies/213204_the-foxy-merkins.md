Margaret is a down-on-her-luck hooker in training, who meets up with Jo, a beautiful and self-assured grifter from a wealthy family and an expert on servicing women, even as she considers herself proudly heterosexual. The film follows their adventures together on the street, through encounters with husky-voiced seductresses, mumbling erotic accessory salesmen and shopaholic swingers. Navigating the bizarre fetishes and sexual needs of their 'dates' brings into focus the hilarious and pathetic disparity between the two hookers, fellow travelers who will share the road together but only for a while.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/viWnfGc4FpMEdgBXf2nubFQU5D0.jpg", "actors": ["Lisa Haas (Margaret)", "Jackie Monahan (Jo)", "Susan Ziegler (Kinky Republican Lady)", "Alex Karpovsky (The Mumbling Erotic Accessory Salesman / CNN Executive)", "Dennis Davis (Margaret's Brother)", "Rae C.
