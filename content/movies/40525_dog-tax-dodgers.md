Being kind of a cheapskate, he hides his dog in the closet from Wally's presence but, upon entering Andy's house, Wally still suspects something is amiss. He uses a trained flea to reveal the dog who gets chased by Wally into a pond in the backyard. After \"fishing\" the dog out, Wally demands Andy pay his $3.00 but both are in for a surprise: the dog has an entire litter of puppies each worth an additional $3.00!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gfcLMRW5wQsKgnu763hALu4Gzz3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
