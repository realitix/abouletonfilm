For him the picture is clear \u2013 there are those who are right and fair, the so-called \"red\", the representatives of a new order who came to their musty world together with the Soviet government and the communists, and there are bad or \"white\" \u2013 those who do not accept this new and bright life. Janis\u2019 father, a kulak, strongly opposes and prevents the creation of the collective farm, which means he is against the happy tomorrow and little Janis makes his major life choice: he betrays his father, telling the authorities about his unjust activities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l1NxiQezJ3zumJLxkB2SqfmIt7x.jpg", "actors": ["Antons Georgs Grauds ()", "Vilis Daudzi\u0146\u0161 ()", "Wiktor Zborowski ()", "Andris Keiss ()", "Liena Smukste ()", "\u0122irts Kr\u016bmi\u0146\u0161 ()", "Rudolfs Plepis ()", "Ivars Brakovskis ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
