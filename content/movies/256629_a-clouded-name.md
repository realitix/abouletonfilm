(Five years earlier Jim's engagement to Marjorie Dare was broken when her mother was killed and his father disappeared.) Through certain circumstance Marjorie also becomes Leighton's guest, and Jim moves out into the woods. There he meets Smiles, a little girl in the care of strange old Ben Tangleface. Leighton wishes to wed Marjorie for her money and is trying forcefully to persuade her to accept him when Jim comes to the rescue. But Ben, his memory stirred by the sight of Leighton, kills him.

He was wounded while defending Marjorie's mother, whom Leighton killed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9noEf5k9hrVyQ7DtOFJzqmeLYUp.jpg", "actors": ["Norma Shearer (Marjorie Dare)", "Gladden James (Jim Allen)", "Yvonne Logan (Smiles)", "Richard Neill (Stewart Leighton)", "Frederick Eckhart (Ben Tangleface)", "Charles Miller (Sam Slocum)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
