Abandoning the narrative confines of the true crime genre, the story is told through fragmented moments from the lives of several characters, whose fates are tragically intertwined. As the sky grows darker, the placid surface of daily life becomes disturbed by a lurking and inevitable horror.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pwymt8MarrCIdsT4YlSJMzbuTgf.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Jumper ()", "Karina Macias ()", "Aaron Purvis ()", "Rosie Rodriguez ()", "Anna Rose ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [347956, 268824, 403665, 461698], "youtube_key": "4aGmQGo3hVw"}
