His first case turns out to be defending a pig that's accused of murdering a child. And the pig is owned by beautiful gypsy Samira (Annabi), so the idealistic lawyer can fall in love (or lust). There's religion and superstition, there's power struggles, there's ignorance versus knowledge--things sound very modern indeed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vEE1cTQpoecXlJzP3hJQXjMVjEo.jpg", "actors": ["Colin Firth (Richard Courtois)", "Ian Holm (Albertus)", "Donald Pleasence (Pincheon)", "Amina Annabi (Samira)", "Nicol Williamson (Seigneur Jehan d'Auferre)", "Michael Gough (Magistrate Boniface)", "Harriet Walter (Jeannine Martin)", "Jim Carter (Mathieu)", "Lysette Anthony (Filette d'Auferre)", "Sophie Dix (Maria)", "Dave Atkins (Valliere)", "Elizabeth Spriggs (Madame Langlois)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [78146, 55636, 47393, 72491], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
