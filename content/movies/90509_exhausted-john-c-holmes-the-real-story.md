In this decade when pornstars are on TV, date movie stars, and are on album covers, the secret world of men in raincoats attending sleazy theaters is hard to imagine. Now most people see porn on their cable or on video or DVD. Once upon a time, though, it was a big deal for a porn star to hit the mainstream, and John Holmes did just that.  With a 14 inch endowment and not so good looks, Holmes made thousands of movies and slept with thousands of women. He became well known for his Johnny Wad series, where he was an international man of mystery and hard core sex. Eventually he got heavily into drugs, got involved in a brutal murder, and finally died of AIDS.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pCVu6eIaXfnewbNvIklb3RS0nr0.jpg", "actors": ["John Holmes (Himself)", "Seka (Herself)", "Jesie St. James (Vickey Caruthers)", "Georgina Spelvin (Alexandra)", "Annette Haven (Girl in Opening Credits Only (archive footage))", "Linda Wong (Jasmine (archive footage))", "Paula Wain (Laureen/Sandi (archive footage))", "Laurien Dominique (Penny Holmes (archive footage))", "Fatima Hamoud (Belly Dancer (archive footage))", "Melba Bruce (Patty (archive footage))", "Felecia Sanda (Maria Luisa (archive footage))", "Kyoto Sun (Hit Girl (archive footage))", "Phaery Burd (Tarine (archive footage))", "Candida Royalle (Juanita (archive footage))", "Jennifer Richards (Shari (archive footage))", "Eileen Wells (Sinthia (archive footage))", "Bonnie Holiday (Sharon (archive footage))", "Kitty Shayne (Lorna (archive footage))", "Jessica Temple-Smith (Jenny (archive footage))", "Chris Cassidy (Barbi (archive footage))", "Monique Starr (Charlee Hammond (archive footage))", "Phadre (Dancer in Opening Credits Only (archive footage))", "Laurie Smith (Herself - Brunette in Hammock)", "Laura Toledo (Herself - Blonde in Hammock)", "Morgan Lofting (Narrator (voice))", "Bob Chinn (Himself - Interviewee/Frankie (also archive footage) (uncredited))", "Damon Christian (Guy Getting Jumped (archive footage) (uncredited))", "Joan Devlon (Juanita (uncredited))", "Michelle Scher (Girl Getting Slapped (archive footage) (uncredited))", "Julia St. Vincent (Herself - Interviewer (uncredited))", "Elliot Lewis (Guy Getting Shot/Bartender (archive footage) (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
