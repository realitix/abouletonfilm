Meet artist Steve Kurtz, whose work led to suspicion of bioterrorism; lawyer Lynne Stewart, convicted of aiding terrorism; and naturalized citizen Mohamed Yousry, whose 20 years of peace in New York City ended after Sept. 11. Chan's project is an eye-opening document of the hysteria driven by the war on terror and of the victims who few even know exist.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
