It's a story that attempts to throw light on the average Joe six-pack's run-in with organised crime, as well as the daily toll it has on a working-class neighborhood. \r\n\r\nThe acting is good all-round and the subject matter is not stylised or glamorized as is ordinarily the case. For a TV movie, it's of an unusual caliber and the narrative is intense as it is compelling. We're shown different character prerogatives and this as a whole amounts to a thoughtful piece."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "-sA1GvNyuMs"}
