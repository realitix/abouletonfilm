Before he is formally charged by the police, he sets out on a two-day odyssey to find the real killer: tracking down his leads from the backseat of a rented limousine. This allows him to converse and ponder class, society, life in the city, and to contemplate the dirt that runs in the small nooks and valleys of cosmopolitan life. Mid-way through the film, the style transforms into Brividio Giallo contemporary, wordless operatic imagery of sex and violence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/szMMOx9hpUcYxwvvdwHrF9N4Sz5.jpg", "actors": ["Dan Ellis (Detective)", "Tristan Risk (Juliette)", "Raresh DiMofte (Killer)", "Momona Komagata (Lina)", "Ariel Hansen (Zara)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
