Although only a short, Vite was one of the most costly of all the Zanzibar productions. It features, for instance, shots of the moon taken by a state-of-the-art telescope, the Questar, that Pommereulle first saw while visiting Marlon Brando in southern California in 1968. In Rohmer\u2019s La Collectionneuse, Pommereulle and his friend Adrien philosophize on how best to achieve le vide (emptiness) during their summer holidays. Three years later, Pommereulle would transform the word \u201cvide\u201d to \u201cvite\u201d (quickly), signifying his profound disenchantment with the aftermath of the revolution of May \u201968. \u2014Harvard Film Archive", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mAe3dib84L6RZeWXWeSjVkLzo4R.jpg", "actors": ["Mustapha ()", "Daniel Pommereulle ()", "Charlie Urvois ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
