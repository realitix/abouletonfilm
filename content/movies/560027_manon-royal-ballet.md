In decadent 18th century Paris, the young, beautiful and naive Manon is torn between a life of privilege and luxury with the wealthy Monsieur GM or love with the poor student Des Grieux.  Manon has become one the Royal Ballet's signature works since its creation by choreographer Kenneth MacMillan in 1974. This typically sumptuous production is designed by Nicholas Georgiadis and staged by Monica Mason and Monica Parker.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uPXBY3jnahpgdt9IACJGzxe1HT4.jpg", "actors": ["Tamara Rojo ()", "Carlos Acosta ()", "Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00edn ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
