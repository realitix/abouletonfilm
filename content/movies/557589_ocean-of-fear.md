The movie investigated the shark attacks that occurred when the USS Indianapolis sank. Hundreds of crew that survived were stranded in the water for four days before rescue. In that time many of the survivors endured constant shark attacks. The Discovery Channel hired George H. Burgess, a renowned investigator in shark attacks, to determine, \"why the sharks attacked the way they did,\" and to \"investigate the survival strategies of the men in the water, including those who fought the sharks.\"", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Richard Bedser (Director)", "Richard Dreyfuss (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
