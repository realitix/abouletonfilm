A big fence and a live-in staff of servants are there to shield Cristobal from the harsher realities of life, while his younger sister Elisa (Camila Sodi), there with her own crowd, uses drugs as her chosen means of escape. There are, however, some realities that cannot be kept at bay forever, like the reason behind their parents' prolonged absence, the gradual breakdown in the villa's amenities, and Cristobal's dwindling university prospects.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vFbcl4QBBgRrEiZleJfeNwcrN6f.jpg", "actors": ["Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal (Cristobal)", "Camila Sodi (Elisa)", "Luz Cipriota (Dolores)", "Tenoch Huerta (Adan)", "Jorge Luis Moreno (Charlie)", "Ana Serradilla (Mafer)", "Fernanda Castillo (-)", "Pamela Reiter (Mariana)", "Giovanna Zacar\u00edas ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [16030], "youtube_key": "hrKacPZp7rQ"}
