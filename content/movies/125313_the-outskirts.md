During the entire film, it does not stop snowing once. As the peasants make their way across the frozen tundra toward the city that houses oil company headquarters, they take vengeance against a series of former Communist bureaucrats who connived with oil company executives. Except for the youth Kolya that they have drafted into their crusade against the protestations of his babushka-wearing mother, they are all grizzled veterans of WWII.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wyGtww0cJHGWzYNHFrfKZntQXbA.jpg", "actors": ["Yuriy Dubrovin ()", "Nikolay Olyalin ()", "Aleksei Pushkin ()", "Aleksey Vanin ()", "Rimma Markova ()", "Viktor Stepanov ()", "Anatoliy Koshcheev ()", "Viktor Venes ()", "Alexandr Vdovin ()", "Galina Zolotaryova ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [56735, 64393, 48012, 110555], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
