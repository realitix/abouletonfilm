This is also the story of that policeman, the tall enigmatic Christopher Hurley who chose to work in some of the toughest and wildest places in Australia, and of the struggle to bring him to trial. The Tall Man is a story in luminous detail of two worlds clashing - and a haunting moral puzzle that no viewer will forget.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lADneM8kcW8zu7pP3IiU6SePV0f.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
