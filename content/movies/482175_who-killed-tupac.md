And of course they come to the conclusion that the only realistic scenario is that of which her book includes (the Orlando Brown Crip payback theory).\r\n\r\nNow that's actually the theory I believe myself, but I felt like they didn't give any of the other scenarios any real chance.\r\n\r\nSure the Puffy ordered hit on Pac theory is a bit of a stretch BUT they paint it out as Puffy being a proffesional not dabbling in criminal activities to debunk the theory (when in fact Puffy's had a number of violent acts in his crime sheet, alot of which were acts against people in the music-business) I'm not saying that I believe the theory but don't just debunk stuff by hiding facts.\r\n\r\nThe Death Row Takeover is the most interesting conspiracy theory IMO, as it is a rather plausible one. And for the whole episode it seems that the conclusion is gonna be that this MIGHT be it, especially when Reggie Wright Jr sounds and looks more guilty everytime he's in front of the camera. And the suspicious O.A. (Orlando Anderson?) payment shortly after Tupac's death from David Kenner's account. But at the end of that episode they yet again somehow manages to rule that theory out, with no reason whatsoever of doing so it just isn't the theory that they are trying to sell you (and make you read more about in Lolita Files book).\r\n\r\nAnd they didn't even try to get into the Lil Half Dead theory they pretty much debunked that before they got into it, and they didn't even bother to ask Half Dead any tough questions, not even why Half Dead on his Dead Serious album have included a dead Tupac on the cover. And I found it odd that he said that him and Snoop met Tupac and everything was friendly the day before when Snoop has always said that Tupac and him were on bad terms on the time of his death (due to Snoop being friends with both BIG and Pac).\r\n\r\nAnyways it's a whole lot of stuff they should have done different and taken their task more seriously. But the interviews are still mostly pretty interesting (as a person who's interested at least). But episode 6 was awful and they showed their true colors there I felt.\r\n\r\nAlso Benjamin Crump seemed to be on there just to promote BlackLivesMatter and moments where he was shocked seemed like straight up (poor) acting. And it wouldn't surprise me if that police investigation paper regarding the murder weapon was manufactured by the producers themselves for dramatic effect.\r\n\r\nBut yeah it's still mostly enjoyable, just take everything with a grain of salt and use your own head to think instead of going by the conclusions of these hosts."}], "recommandations_id": []}
