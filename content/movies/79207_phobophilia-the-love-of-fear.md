Paul Provenza spends the whole show trapped in a system of giant tubes.

Other notable tricks include earthworms finding a photo from a stack, a borrowed ring apparently cut from a volunteer's stomach, and a bullet swap.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1Zebm9RoF6pjt4tU0SZ1hqq8r4D.jpg", "actors": ["Penn Jillette (Himself)", "Teller (Himself)", "Kari Coleman ()", "David Strickland ()", "Paul Provenza ()", "Billy West ((voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
