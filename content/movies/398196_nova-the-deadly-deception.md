Informed that they were being treated for \u201cbad blood,\u201d their doctors had no intention of curing them of syphilis at all.  The data for the experiment was to be collected from autopsies of the men, and they were thus deliberately left to degenerate under the ravages of tertiary syphilis\u2014which can include tumors, heart disease, paralysis, blindness, insanity, and death. \u201cAs I see it,\u201d one of the doctors involved explained, \u201cwe have no further interest in these patients until they die.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
