Taking in to consideration the fact that I'm being delivered _Velvet Buzzsaw_ by the same writer, director, and star as _Nightcrawler_, honestly, yes. But that is a very high bar to try and meet, falling short of it is none too heinous an offence. On its own merits, _Velvet Buzzsaw_ features some magnificent acting, cool effects, engaging plotline, despicable characters and a hefty dose of originality. It's not a perfect film, it's probably not even a great film, but I've started years off in far worse ways before.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"}], "recommandations_id": [537996, 361292, 405774, 483906], "youtube_key": "XdAR-lK43YU"}
