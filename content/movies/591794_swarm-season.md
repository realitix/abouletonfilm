Meanwhile, as Manu\u2019s activist father protests the construction of a giant telescope on the mountain\u2019s sacred ground, a group of scientists study the landscape in preparation for our inevitable relocation to Mars. Ambitiously linking the earthbound and the cosmic, the intimate and the expansive, director Sarah J.
