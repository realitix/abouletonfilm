Lee (Rhys Darby) is a young, skilled OBGYN who lacks confidence when it comes to talking to women outside his successful medical practice. A minor injury temporarily lands him in a wheelchair and it is at that precise time that he meets his dream girl Alex (Sasha Alexander). Convinced she's only paid attention to him because he's in that chair, he stays in it to win her affections well after his injury has healed. Coming &amp; Going is about love and the extreme things people do for it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/724hD5C2kyccWr0uKEUVXzUQchM.jpg", "actors": ["Rhys Darby (Lee)", "Sasha Alexander (Alex)", "Fionnula Flanagan (Irma)", "Pam Cooke (Sue)", "Michael Cornacchia (Stan)", "Brian Hooks (Chad Collins)", "Ivana Mili\u010devi\u0107 (Ivana)", "Carla Gallo (Linda)", "Mather Zickel (Simon)", "Vivian Bang (Joy)", "Jenica Bergere (Mrs. Jensen)", "Dulce Maria Solis (Lupe)", "David Mazouz (Timmy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [325111, 200580], "youtube_key": "Wyf4Wk5iJ0Q"}
