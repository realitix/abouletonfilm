Maybe once, some time ago, he was loved. Maybe, some time, he had loved ones waiting for him, missing him. Today he is only a shadow, lost amongst all the shadows of the days that begin and no one sees. He is a shadow that wakes up in the sidewalk and rummages the trashcans, searching for plastic bottles or cans to sell for a few coins that will give him to eat for the day.
