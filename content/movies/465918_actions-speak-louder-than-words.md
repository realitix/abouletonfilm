The result is a diverse, assertive collage, ranging from advice on how to seduce a librarian( in silence, of course), to the importance of short hair in visibly proclaiming your lesbianism and deafness: plus an essential beginner's guide to sexual signing. Shot entirely in British Sign Language with subtitles for the hearing.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
