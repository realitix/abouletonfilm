Her breakup throws her easy life into mild existential crisis, but the arrival of a new boy on the scene, Lewis, diverts her attention and helps her rediscover the joys of a lazy summer in the city. Acting as unofficial tour guide, Mel introduces Lewis to her neighborhood. Together they buy Lewis a bike from a crotchety yard salesman, and embark on a two-wheeled urban adventure. But is Mel ready to switch gears? Unsure of her true heart feelings, she and her gang of young, witty friends, enjoy the season's last gasps.
