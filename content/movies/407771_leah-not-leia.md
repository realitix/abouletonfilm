This story chronicles the times of a girl named LEAH, who has a particular disgust for that popular Science Fiction series, for that very reason. From the moment she was born, people have gotten her name completely wrong because of that movie. Well no more. She is taking a stand and reminding others that her name is LEAH NOT LEIA. This comedy short strikes back for every kid named Scotty that had to hear 'Beam me up!' repeatedly, or every girl named Jenny that had to listen to that infamous telephone number over and over again. This film will give you a new hope for naming our future generations.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
