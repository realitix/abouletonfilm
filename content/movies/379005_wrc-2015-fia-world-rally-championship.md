That\u2019s why the official review is packed full of the most stunning footage you\u2019re likely to see this year.  From the dramatic forest stage of Finland to the high, hot and arid mountains of Mexico the beautiful backdrops make WRC simply stunning to watch.  Jari-Matti Latvalla, Mads \u00d8stberg, Andreas Mikkelsen, Thierry Neuville and more take the fight to Ogier but, with over one hundred points in hand with three rounds to go, Ogier and co-driver Ingrassia sealed the Championship in fine style.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u3qjb8ioKFQg4GQXpdhJu9wCqVX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "g2ZjyhrMW1U"}
