The only thing that's more interesting than watching enemy planes fly past is the burning desire to discover the secrets of sexuality with the fiery Rosa. But then bombs actually do start falling on their little town \u2013 and the boys are sent to a Czech spa to wait out the end of the war... Worse yet is another problem they have to contend with: Alex learns that he's Jewish! As the choir prepares a concert that Hitler is planning to attend, the boys are swept up into a world of intrigue and danger \u2013 and into the bed of the brave and beautiful partisan Helenka... With both the war and the boys' hormones raging, Alex and Ferry embark on a coming-of-age adventure unlike any other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6ejQoGtpbwoWJyLIopWZlgBhNfS.jpg", "actors": ["Lorenz Willkomm (Alex)", "Johannes Nussbaum (Ferry)", "Susanne Lothar (Alice)", "Udo Samel (Chorleiter)", "Benedikt H\u00f6sl (Ben)", "Felix Jancik (Spindelhannes)", "Catalin Adrian Iova (Lama)", "Fanny Krausz (Rosa)", "Andrei Voicu (Hubert)", "Daniela Nane (Helenka)", "Ciprian Chirita (Leo)", "Levente Moln\u00e1r (Stollenwart)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "JgdMu3UqyHg"}
