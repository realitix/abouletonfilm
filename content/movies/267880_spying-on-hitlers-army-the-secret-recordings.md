The prisoners' unguarded reminiscences and unintentional confessions have only just come to light, and prove how closely the German army were involved in the atrocities of the Holocaust.  British intelligence requisitioned three stately homes for this epic task, and converted each into an elaborate trap.  The 100,000 hours of conversation they captured provided crucial intelligence that changed the course of the war, and revealed some of its worst horrors, from rape to mass executions to one of the earliest bulletins from the concentration camps.  But when the fighting ended, the recordings were destroyed and the transcripts locked away for half a century. Only now have they been declassified, researched and cross-referenced.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cML7gTtdlF0V9B8YacF6LIFq12.jpg", "actors": ["Philip Glenister (Narrator)", "David Barrass (General Kittel)", "Nicholas Farrell (General von Thoma)", "Jack Fortune (General Bruhn)", "Rupert Frazer (General Cruwell)", "Richard Freeman (General Von Choltitz)", "Peter Harding (General Schlieben)", "Gareth Keiran Jones (Fried)", "Elliott Jordan (Hartelt)", "Valentine Pelka (General Von Felbert)", "Rafe Pugh (Minnieur)", "Alan Turkington (Pffanberger)", "Thomas Wheatley (Lord Aberfeldy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "abnzGVLQQZ0"}
