No stone has been left unturned in the painstaking process of piecing together what happened on that fateful day. The government's official version of events has been consistent: Hijackers commandeered commercial jetliners in a highly coordinated terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon that took the lives of some 3,000 Americans. Theories abound contradicting the official version of events: Did the Twin Towers really collapse from the fires, or did explosives inside cause the buildings to implode? Was the Pentagon hit by a missile, and not a commercial airliner? And why do so many people believe theories like these?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sSagdxRpZC47EmAaDIrwNBCSWZE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
