Sun has to baby-sit his small brother in a pram and envies Pep\u00edk his nice adoptive parents because his own father beats him often. Pep\u00edk is happy - he will have soon the same surname Marek as his father and mother. Pep\u00edk is shocked when Sun tells him that Mrs Markov\u00e1 is pregnant.
