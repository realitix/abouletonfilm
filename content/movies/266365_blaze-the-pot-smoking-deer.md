The creators (Adam Cooley/SeaMonster3D) aren't into drugs -- the show is here to ask the question, \"Why do people want to watch a show about a superhero who is on drugs?\" An absurdist existential essay on the idea of animation and superheroes, the core of the show is primarily about a pot-smoking superhero deer who knows he's on \"television\" and constantly talks to the audience about what it's like to be a superhero. He is fully aware he is being animated.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u1cy6l8GgVG3j7qno8tab1DQVk9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
