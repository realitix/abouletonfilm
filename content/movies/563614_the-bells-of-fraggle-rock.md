Despite Cantus' warnings, Gobo goes on a journey to find out if the mythical Great Bell at the heart of Fraggle Rock is real. When the Rock slows down in the winter, the Fraggles hold the Festival of the Bells to make sure it keeps moving. As part of the celebration, they ring bells to awaken the Great Bell at the heart of the Rock. They also dress up as a Weebabeast, who used to guard the Great Bell when the Rock was small.  Meanwhile, Doc and Sprocket explore mid-winter holiday traditions from around the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/68vvqwPuWJKDNoAEAmLyMJxMFmn.jpg", "actors": ["Steve Whitmire (Wembley Fraggle / Sprocket the Dog (voice))", "Dave Goelz (Boober Fraggle / Uncle Travelling Matt (voice))", "Kathryn Mullen (Mokey Fraggle (voice))", "Gerard Parkes (Doc)", "Jerry Nelson (Gobo Fraggle (voice))", "Jim Henson (Cantus the Minstrel (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "GtFYCeLgcwo"}
