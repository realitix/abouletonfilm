Dolph Lundgren - star of a whole bunch of epic actioners\r\nfrom THE EXPENDABLES to RED SCORPION - is on fine performance as this\r\nPentathlon player. Is there nothing this man can't do?! What we have\r\nhere is a slightly different Lundgren vehicle - it's less about\r\nshooting up baddies and more about competing...with Nazis, naturally.\r\nInstead what we get is Dolph film in which his character is not only a\r\npowerful and strong bad-ass, but sensitive and very funny at time.\r\nPENTATHLON is a mighty fine sports film which is perfect for the\r\nOlympics fever that's spreading around with the build up to the 2012\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nActing along side Dolphy is the brilliant Mr David Soul (from SALEM'S\r\nLOT, STARSKY AND HUTCH and the hilariously offensive JERRY SPRINGER:\r\nTHE OPERA). His performance is equally great, in which he plays a cold,\r\nevil Nazi hell bent on winning at any cost. And I mean ANY cost!\r\nPENTATHLON is a fantastic film for any and every action and sports fan.\r\nThe perfect piece of entertainment for the Olympics build-up too. The\r\nnew Anchor Bay Blu-ray is presented in glorious high-def, this release\r\nis the best you'll ever see it!"}], "recommandations_id": [54840, 86095, 66854, 28646], "youtube_key": "GgGbwrZgOSM"}
