The transition from being underground to mainstream has taken a long time (much longer if you just look at North America). For instance, the scene in the UK has been a prevalent part of their popular culture for over two decades. In 2012, EDM has reached a fever pitch, becoming the hottest ticket in music since Hip Hop in the late nineties. With the mainstreaming of electronic music it has opened up the gates of a broader critical look at the genre as a whole. The Drop is a documentary film exploring the EDM culture explosion. From the Artists, to the fans, to the business to the festivals, the Drop will follow all aspects of the growth of a genre of music that is defining today's generation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aMoJShEbcZAAwNN5l1Kfncn4uGy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
