They are stupid, scheming, self-regarding dudes who are convinced of their own greatness. They are also convinced that they can fix their pathetic lives with self-help books. Unfortunately for the guys, self-help is not moron-proof. The foursome's idiotic attempts at bettering themselves lead to lost jobs, poorly timed acid trips, and incarceration. Due to a gross mistranslation of a Mexican website, the guys become convinced that they must travel to Mexico to find an all-knowing guru named Don Rodrigo. On the road to enlightenment the group runs into drugs, guns, gangsters, hot Mexican babes and lots of tequila.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bgQSFammlrHZbYdB9phlw5nAmD3.jpg", "actors": ["Andrick Deppmeyer (The Drake)", "Patrick Cassidy (John Candy)", "Patrick Simone (Simon)", "Adam Jaroszewski (Felix)", "Kylie Clay (Vanessa)", "Jaime Del Aguila (Juan)", "Devin The Dude (The Dude)", "Abel Gonzalez (Armando)", "Alberto Gutierrez (Don Rodrigo)", "Conor Long (Jerry)", "Michael Long (Jim Johnson)", "Ellen J.
