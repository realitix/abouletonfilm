Iago confides to his friend -- who had hoped to marry Desdemona -- that he serves Othello to further his own ends. Venice needs Othello to protect its commercial interests in Cyprus where the Turkish fleet is headed. Desdemona insists on going to Cyprus, too. In Cyprus, Iago plots to convince Othello that Desdemona has betrayed him with Cassio. A lot more than political ambition seems to be motivating Iago.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sZ3TC3fWzp7La7MSocMi3m3GZGM.jpg", "actors": ["Anthony Hopkins ()", "Anthony Pedley (Roderigo)", "Bob Hoskins (Iago)", "Geoffrey Chater (Brabantio)", "Alexander Davion (Gratiano)", "David Yelland (Cassio)", "Joseph O'Conor (Lodovico)", "Peter Walmsley (Officer)", "John Barron (Duke of Venice)", "Seymour Green (First Senator)", "Howard Goorney (Second Senator)", "Penelope Wilton (Desdemona)", "Rosemary Leach (Emilia)", "Tony Steedman (Montano)", "Max Harvey (First Gentleman)", "Terence McGinity (Second Gentleman)", "Nigel Nobes (Third Gentleman)", "Wendy Morgan (Bianca)", "Arabella Weir (Lady in Waiting)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
