While an animated cast of animal \u201cspirit guides\u201d quote Philip Larkin\u2019s poem, This Be the Verse, and implore us to \u201cget out as early as you can\u201d from life and our parents\u2019 grasp, a hunter dreams of a zoo where he might lie next to tranquilized animals calmed of their savagery. A senile and unstable God stumbles, forgets to take his medication, and turns frost into diamonds. Beauty Plus Pity contemplates the shame and beauty of existence; it is part apologia, part call to arms.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
