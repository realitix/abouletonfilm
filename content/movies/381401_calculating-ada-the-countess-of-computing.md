In this film, Dr Hannah Fry tells the story of Ada's remarkable life. Born in the early 19th century, Ada was a countess of the realm, a scandalous socialite and an 'enchantress of numbers'. The film is an enthralling tale of how a life infused with brilliance, but blighted by illness and gambling addiction, helped give rise to the modern era of computing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ctnuP1L7XUWwiVs2CtQF2p3PbhR.jpg", "actors": ["Hannah Fry (Herself - Presenter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
