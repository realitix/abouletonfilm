She visits a magician cat and asks for a way to make her breasts bigger. She pays the cat\u2019s fee with her pet, a hamster. The magician gives her a magic balloon, which works this way: her breasts get bigger as the balloon gets blown up. She becomes upset when she sees that the cat tries to eat her pet. She has to choose between getting bigger breasts and saving her hamster. She decides to keep her wish as her own and gives her hamster back to the magician. The hamster gets angry, so it pops the magic balloon away. Finally, she loses her pet and her desire for a large cleavage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vpT6hfGZ3TlomeX78KuyyIiupR9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
