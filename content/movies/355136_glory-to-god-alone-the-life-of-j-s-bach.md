This is his story, unfolded from the very places where his key life events took place.  Born into a musical family, Bach's life was almost predetermined to be in the field of music. But from a child he internalized the art and passionately pursued the development of his skills. It would result in a legacy that has enriched the world and continues to inspire, engage, and touch souls across diverse cultural boundaries now close to three hundred years later.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bDYGIMCHoslNuy8seFWQy6fdT2U.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
