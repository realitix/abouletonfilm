Incorporating comments about the influence of figures as diverse as Chaplin and Eisenstein, about the ethical and aesthetic implications of film technique and such matters as rhythm, sound mixing, and acting, WHERE LIES YOUR HIDDEN SMILE? becomes a tour de force, immersing us in the mysteries of cinema as practiced by some of its greatest creators. Costa calls the film both his first comedy and his first love story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cdGscNeGmVyTUeyvNFk3pvnY9Np.jpg", "actors": ["Jean-Marie Straub (Himself)", "Dani\u00e8le Huillet (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
