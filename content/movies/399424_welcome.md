This video pays homage to that history by taking the Hyperlite pro wakeboard and wakeskate team and filming them on and off the water while they spend some time at Radar Lake. Each rider is given a significant section in the film", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/flr0w7ZRP3V856R9kbqEzqDJ8DH.jpg", "actors": ["Scott Byerly (Scott Byerly)", "JD Webb (JD Webb)", "Shaun Murray (Shaun Murray)", "Erik Ruck (Erik Ruck)", "Brian Grubb (Brian Grubb)", "Parks Bonifay (Parks Bonifay)", "Chad Sharpe (Chad Sharpe)", "Danny Harf (Danny Harf)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
