But the shortcomings of the new gangs mean that he is soon having to call on his old-school yakuza talents. And when he falls for Asako, a beautiful piano player, she unknowingly ignites a fire within Kuni that will immolate everything and everybody around him. Regarded by many as his masterpiece, Onibi has all the hallmarks of a Mochizuki film, with the gangster elements tightly compressed and controlled to allow space in which a subdued romance can bloom. Coming from a background in porno cinema, this master of sexual relations injects a fresh passion and tension into the macho world of the yakuza film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o0NrWJLcG1dl8w4buq5a5sqz5Ve.jpg", "actors": ["Yoshio Harada (Noriyuki Kunihiro)", "Reiko Kataoka (Asako Hino)", "Sho Aikawa (Naoto Tanigawa)", "Kazuki Kitamura (Hideyuki Sakata (as Yasushi Kitamura))", "Ry\u00fbshi Mizukami (Hanamura)", "Hiroyuki Tsunekawa (Satoshi Fujima)", "Ry\u00fbji Yamamoto (Hiroshi Fujima)", "Yoshiaki Fujita (Kinjo)", "Ei Kawakami (Yoshida)", "Toshihiro Kinomoto (Aoki)", "Seiroku Nakazawa (Nagashima)", "Masai Ikenaga (Kizaki)", "Eiji Minakata (Kanigawa)", "Hajime Yamazaki (Driving School Teacher)", "Yukio Yamanouchi ()", "Noriko Hayami (Toshimi)", "Eiji Okuda (Myojin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "bcKJ0obP-FA"}
