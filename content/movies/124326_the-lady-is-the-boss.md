He may get his wish, thanks to the young, beautiful, intelligent Chan Mei Ling (Kara Wai Ying Hung), who arrives from the states to open a new branch of the school. Armed with an unfamiliar, modern way of thinking, Mei Ling goes about recruiting new students in strange, and sometimes questionably legal ways. Yuan is furious, but when the local triads enter the picture, the two put their differences aside to take back the neighborhood.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vOD7tLz11hqMJVz1iag5Lnlzan4.jpg", "actors": ["Liu Chia-Liang (Wang Hsieh Yun)", "Kara Hui (Chan Mei Ling)", "Gordon Liu Chia-Hui (Lee Hon Man)", "Wong Yu (Ah Yung/Ah Wing)", "Robert Mak (Wong Yuen Shuei)", "Cheung Chin-Pang (Ng Ming Fat)", "Hsiao Ho (Cheuk Jin Shing)", "Johnny Wang Lung-Wei (Big Boss)", "Lam Fai-Wong (Ah Fai)", "Sun Chien (Ah Chang)", "Ku Feng (Wah Chaing Martial Arts Ass. member)", "Ho Wai-Han (Club Girl)", "Lung Tien-Hsiang (Tang Shiang)", "Wong Ching-Ho (Wah Chaing Martial Arts Ass. member)", "Shum Lo (Wah Chaing Martial Arts Ass. member)", "King Lee King-Chu (Big Boss's thug)", "Ting Tung (Night club's patron)", "Ailen Sit (Big Boss's thug)", "Ngai Tim-Choi (New student)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [157321, 75839, 64257, 105482], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
