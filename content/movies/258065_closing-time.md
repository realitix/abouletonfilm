When he is thrown out of a joint because it is closing time, there is always a willing lady to spend the rest of the night with. In the street he has countless semi-philosophical discussions with fellow drinkers, male and female, (shot in black-and-white, as prologue to the different chapters) but in the end it often comes down to one thing: the bottle of whisky that has to be finished. An encounter with a homeless young man with AIDS marks a turning point in the life of the writer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8olXIa1U7ajlLJKqd2ZeH2RNOZQ.jpg", "actors": ["Sansh\u00f4 Shinsui ()", "Takeo Nakahara ()", "Kazuki Kitamura ()", "Mari Natsuki ()", "Ako Jiss\u00f4ji ()", "Y\u00fbko Ishiwa ()", "Bengaru ()", "Sei Hiraizumi ()", "Ry\u00f4ta Nakanishi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
