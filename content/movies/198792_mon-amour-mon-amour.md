She ends up pregnant but does not tell her lover about her condition as she contemplates having an abortion. The viewer must decide whether it was all real or all a figment of the young woman's imagination. By this time, nobody cares. The highlights of this pretentious feature are the nude scenes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6XKuJwJsJQMZ4J86h9nyrpdgNCT.jpg", "actors": ["Jean-Louis Trintignant (Vincent Falaise)", "Val\u00e9rie Lagrange (Agathe)", "Annie Fargue (Jeanne)", "Michel Piccoli (Marrades)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
