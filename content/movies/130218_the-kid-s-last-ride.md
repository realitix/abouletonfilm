In the saloon, young Jimmy Rowell is losing money in a crooked poker game to saloon owner Bob Harmon. Harmon and his henchman Bart Gill are in reality wanted-outlaw brothers Jim and Ike Breedon seeking revenge against Jimmy and his school-teaching sister Sally as their father, a circuit judge in Nebraska, had sentenced their brother Bud to be hanged. Harmon involves Jimmy, because of his gambling debts, in a robbery of a rancher known to keep large amounts of money at his ranch. The Range Busters break up the robbery, Bart is killed, as is Rancher Fleming, and Jimmy is wounded but escapes. Harmon, setting a trap for Crash, tricks Sally and Jimmy to his hideout, and Crash follows them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/BX2Vb4by0an37jkLQ1wgDnBLgI.jpg", "actors": ["Ray Corrigan (Crash Corrigan)", "John 'Dusty' King (Dusty King)", "Max Terhune (Alibi Terhune)", "Elmer (Elmer, Alibi's Dummy)", "Luana Walters (Sally Rowell)", "Edwin Brian (Jimmy Rowell)", "Al Bridge (Bob Harmon / Jim Breeden)", "Glenn Strange (Bart Gill / Ike Breeden)", "Frank Ellis (Henchman Wash)", "John Elliott (Disher)", "George Havens (School boy)", "Jack Baxley (Jack)", "Roy Bucko (Gambler)", "Jack Evans (Gambler)", "Herman Hack (Barfly)", "Al Haskell (Dealer Blackie)", "Walter James (Bartender)", "Ray Jones (Gambler)", "Carl Mathews (Henchman)", "Jack Montgomery (Barfly)", "George Morrell (Rancher Fleming)", "Tex Palmer (Henchman Tex)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
