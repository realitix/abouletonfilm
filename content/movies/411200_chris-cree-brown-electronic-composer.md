Some sounds are made instrumentally, while others are recorded from his environment. In 1980 few classically-trained musicians in New Zealand experimented with synthesized sound and the gloriously large and sturdy equipment Brown uses to create his music will be of sure anthropological interest to many musos. The documentary was recorded with no script to capture the true art of creation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/laqU0uXOJfFjQmeGUmsHOA5uPtv.jpg", "actors": ["Chris Cree Brown (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
