To pay tribute to the 30th anniversary of Pavarotti\u2019s Met debut, the company featured him in fully staged excerpts of three operas: Act II of Donizetti\u2019s L\u2019Elisir d\u2019Amore, Act III of Puccini\u2019s La Boh\u00e8me (the opera he sang at his debut), and Act IV of Verdi\u2019s Aida. Joining the superstar tenor were colleagues like Ruth Ann Swenson, Leo Nucci, Daniela Dess\u00ec, Maria Guleghina, and Dolora Zajick, all conducted by James Levine.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zm0UmDUjVnNeZlCbPzlxg6hKpC5.jpg", "actors": ["Luciano Pavarotti ()", "Ruth Ann Swenson ()", "Roberto De Candia ()", "Leo Nucci ()", "Daniela Dess\u00ec ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
