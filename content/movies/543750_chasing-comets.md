It's in this setting that we find our hero Chase Daylight, whose dream to play in the professional Rugby League is falling by the wayside, just like his relationship to Brooke. At his lowest point, Chase takes a leap of faith to sort out his life. But living this out is a far greater challenge than he imagined, especially among team mates who won't let him give up his partying ways without a fight. Chase's leap of faith might possibly be the worst decision ever he has ever made.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x5rWMfFhNYZNncsiU8v7X52FajR.jpg", "actors": ["Dan Ewing (Chase)", "Isabel Lucas (Brooke)", "John Batchelor (Coach Munsey)", "Rhys Muldoon (Warren Low)", "Stan Walker (Rhys)", "Justin Melvey (Sam Low)", "Kat Hoyos (Dee)", "George Houvardas (The Rev)", "Gary Eck (Kev McCosker)", "Bjorn Stewart (Beefa)", "Peter Phelps (Chase's Manager)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ySDNB-kgyr4"}
