He does not do too well in school, and that makes him an easy victim for the hard core bullies in the new school. When the group leader is moved to a private school, Kim is accepted in the gang - as long as he provides cigarettes for the other members. This of course leads to a confrontation with the school teachers, his family and eventually the gang members.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tJLUGwxQLV6IXyrUHgLIdBpSYMM.jpg", "actors": ["Tommy Hansen ()", "Karen Margrethe Bjerre ()", "Benny Poulsen ()", "Louise Koch ()", "Jonas Elmer ()", "Morten Eriksen ()", "Magnus Grove ()", "Claus Heil ()", "Christian L\u00f8nborg ()", "Louis Steinthal ()", "John Hahn-Petersen ()", "Peter Eszterh\u00e1s ()", "Gyrd L\u00f8fquist ()", "S\u00f8ren Rode ()", "Kirsten Rolffes ()", "Merete Voldstedlund ()", "Ruddy Nyegaard ()", "Finn Nielsen ()", "Henry Jessen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
