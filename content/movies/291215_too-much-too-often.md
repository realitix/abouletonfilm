Taking advantage of the weak-willed masochist, Mike blackmails Dite into giving him a cushy job, then takes advantage of his new position by stealing Dite\u2019s clients, seducing Dite\u2019s elegant daughter, Sara (JOANNE CUNNINGHAM), and climbing his way up the social ladder.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7wXdllGbBdDuBsi6yEnXcHLGMWN.jpg", "actors": ["Buck Starr (Mike Torson)", "Sharon Kent (Lynn)", "Sam Stewart (Jerry / Sam)", "Darlene Bennett (Lisa)", "Bob Oran (Gordon Dite)", "Michelle Fox (Midge)", "Rita Bennett (Rita)", "Jackie Richards ()", "Yolanda Signorelli ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
