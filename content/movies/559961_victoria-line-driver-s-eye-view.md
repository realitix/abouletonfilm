The 1967 stock trains were filmed in their last few years of service in 2009. These were the first fully automatic trains in London running on the Victoria line which was opened in stages from Walthamstow in East London. The whole line is seen in virtually real time from the operator\u2019s cab with the aid of additional lighting. This is more than a Driver\u2019s eye view, for we also follow the progress of our southbound train on the track diagrams of the service control centre, we see inside all the stations with their famous tiled murals, the exteriors of many and of course the operator himself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8eYkbRGv9v9IgxKQDYnNAVgVmXk.jpg", "actors": ["Rob Curling (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "994IywXKR74"}
