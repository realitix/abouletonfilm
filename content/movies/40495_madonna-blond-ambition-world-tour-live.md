The tour supported her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer, and the soundtrack, I'm Breathless. The tour reached North America, Europe and Asia. It was a highly controversial tour, mainly for its juxtaposition of Catholic iconography and sexuality. Rolling Stone called it an \"elaborately choreographed, sexually provocative extravaganza\" and proclaimed it \"the best tour of 1990.\"[1] In 1991, a documentary film, Truth or Dare (aka In Bed with Madonna), was released chronicling the tour. The tour received the \"Most Creative Stage Production\" at the Pollstar Concert Industry Awards.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xlJOG0KqEw7hgRcWa7koK35dkRT.jpg", "actors": ["Madonna (Herself)", "Donna DeLory (Background Vocals / Dancer)", "Niki Harris (Background Vocals / Dancer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [57463, 58627, 40496, 36802], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
