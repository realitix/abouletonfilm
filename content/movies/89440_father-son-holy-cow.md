The little village on the Baltic coast is where he and his wife had sworn to love each other for all eternity when they were still children. Now that everything has changed, Bogdan succumbs to fate and begins to drink heavily. Thankfully his resolute mother has a formula to free the despairing Bogdan from his state of lethargy: renovating the run-down farmhouse and hard work in the stables. One day Bogdan makes a fateful discovery. A surprisingly musical cow, of all things, rekindles Bogdan's life spirits and gives him a crazy idea. His friends and family throw their hands up in horror, and when he tops things by organizing a village feast, things run completely out of control.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/spNySq8wsPjrPqxtaRfUED4WCXX.jpg", "actors": ["Zbigniew Zamachowski (Bogdan)", "Agata Buzek (Anna)", "Antoni Pawlicki (Pawel)", "El\u017cbieta Karkoszka (Katharina)", "Andrzej Mastalerz (Priester)", "Wiktor Zborowski (Veterinary)", "Malwina Buss (Ola)", "Joanna Kasperska (Ilona)", "Lucyna Malec (Izabela)", "Sebastian Becker (Anton)", "Patrycja Topajew (Young Izabela)", "David Lebkowski (Young Bogdan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
