Robert Gagno has all these traits. It might explain why he surged from a complete unknown to one of the world's best players in five years. The achievement is even more impressive considering he was diagnosed with autism at age three. His success on the pinball circuit made him part of a community that provided acceptance and encouragement. With his parents' support and determination, Robert has exceeded every expectation placed upon him. As he approaches adulthood, his next challenge is to become more self-sufficient and gain his independence. From high-stakes tournaments across the continent to his day-to-day search for employment, we follow Robert's persistent progression to overcome obstacles and manage the highs of success and lows of falling short. In Wizard Mode, flashing lights and triple combos highlight an outstanding individual who continues to beat the odds and set records.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vkXENvFYc3BK43jRC8oOkuvQ3mU.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Gagno (Himself)", "Maurizio Gagno (Himself)", "Kathy Gagno (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [431714, 358924, 338167, 325758], "youtube_key": "pYYN2I_-iY4"}
