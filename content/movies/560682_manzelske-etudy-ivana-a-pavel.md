Besides his job and family, the more dynamic Pavel managed to spare some time for his numerous hobbies while Ivana took up the position of his benevolent, understanding supporter from the very beginning. Except for the first years of marriage when the family was struggling with economic problems, she was a housewife and a real keeper of the hearth and home, living primarily for the success, interests and problems of her close ones. Her approach became even more meaningful after the revolution which opened new horizons for Pavel\u2019s enterprising spirit while their children, older Dominik and younger R\u016f\u017eenka, both of whom inherited the active nature of their father, were growing up.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9p648yYjMhFXzK7SS1lAjCMPg4A.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
