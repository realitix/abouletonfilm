Born into poverty and racial segregation, he lived through a monumental time in American history.  This is the story of a cultural icon, and his far-reaching impact on popular music, told in his own words and those of his family and closest collaborators.  Interviews with Keith Richards, Van Morrison, Carlos Santana, Bonnie Raitt and Robert Cray tell how an illiterate man from the rural and impoverished backwaters of the Mississippi Delta influenced their own musical journey. We reveal his part in bringing the Blues to a new generation of young British musicians and how, in turn, those musicians introduced young, mainstream Americans to their own cultural heritage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nl5oNNskvzpdiByNF63kMgIeWMi.jpg", "actors": ["John Lee Hooker (himself)", "Keith Richards (himself)", "Van Morrison (himself)", "Carlos Santana (himself)", "Bonnie Raitt (herself)", "Robert Cray (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
