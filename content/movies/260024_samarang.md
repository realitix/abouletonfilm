Cockle) and his socially superior love, Sai-Yu (Theresa Seth).  Both live in the village of Samarang in the Indian Ocean.  Because Sai-Yu is the daughter of a chief and Ahmang is but a poor fisherman, he needs to increase his wealth before asking for her hand.  Thus he accepts the perilous offer of the wily Chang-Fu, who seeks pearl divers.  Ahmang must brave the treacherous waters of the Forbidden Lagoon of Sakai, home to bloodthirsty cannibals, killer sharks, and a monstrous grasping octopus.  Sai-Yu and Ahmang\u2019s younger brother Ko-Hai come along for kicks, too.  Ahmang finds his pearl, but he and Sai-Yu are stranded on the island, where they befriend a local orangutan.  When they return to the boat, a shark kills Ko-Hai, and Ahmang must get revenge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ea9GE1F1kmZ2x1OO9X1Zf7ZpEUD.jpg", "actors": ["Ahmang (The Pearl Diver)", "Sai-Yu (Sweetheart)", "Chang-Fu (Captain)", "Mamounah (Mother)", "Ko-Hal (Brother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
