The succulent girls of Ridley High are about to graduate and this lust-filled take-off of a famous book fulfills every youthful fantasy ever dreamed of. Mad crushes on male teachers run rampant as our sweet young things explore their budding sexuality as well as each other's bodies. So young, so innocent, so tender, these cute little lasses - bedecked in their mid-thigh uniforms - cross and uncross their virginal legs for their instructors. With shoulder straps that outline their pert, young breasts, teachers struggle to maintain their raging passions. Student/teacher conferences take on a whole new meaning.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2NgET6WV9ztpi038uTObOT46Atm.jpg", "actors": ["Andrea Adams (Opening Credits Girl)", "Bunny Bleu (Mr. Barrett's Girlfriend)", "Judy Ellis (Schoolgirl)", "Kimberly Carson (Holly)", "Tom Byron (Richard)", "Dominique Dancer (Schoolgirl)", "Teri Lea (Schoolgirl)", "Velma Brown (Schoolgirl)", "Renee Summers (Sally's Friend)", "Debra Wong (Sally)", "Paul Thomas (Mr. Barrett)", "Helena Roll (Schoolgirl)", "Eric Edwards (Mr. Chase)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
