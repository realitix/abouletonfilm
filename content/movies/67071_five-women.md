Mobsters out for the money track him down, beating him and raping his wife. Desperate for revenge, he makes himself a sword and sets out to wreak havoc. When he meets the Gonin, a group of five female thieves, his luck only gets worse. Run, Sayuri, Shiho, Saki and Chihiro are fast-shooting, strong-arm women. Not only that, but they're more than prepared to take on an army of gangsters. Unfortunately for them, they stole the ring Masamichi wanted for his wife, and now he's more likely to hunt them than join their cause.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wsKJ5SEBumzE4pfygyzVzuGvmPR.jpg", "actors": ["Ken Ogata (Toyama Masamichi)", "Kimiko Yo (Ran)", "Mai Kitajima (Chihiro)", "Yui Natsukawa ()", "Yumi Nishiyama ()", "Shunsuke Matsuoka ()", "Reiko Kataoka ()", "Yoshiyuki Yamaguchi ()", "Shingo Tsurumi ()", "Toshiyuki Nagashima ()", "Tonpei Hidari ()", "Yumi Takigawa ()", "Susumu Terajima ()", "Daisuke Iijima ()", "Ito Yozaburo ()", "Naoto Takenaka ()", "Kippei Shiina ()", "Minori Terada ()", "Koichi Sato ()", "Jinpachi Nezu ()", "Shun Nakayama ()", "Shinobu \u014ctake ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [26830], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
