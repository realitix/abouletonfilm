Unfortunately, on their first promotional tour, the plane carrying the band crashed and disappeared somewhere in the Swiss Alps - never to be heard of again. That is until now, 50 years later, when the plane is discovered with the Squirrels still inside - frozen alive. Naturally, they're taken to a cryonics lab to be defrosted. Long Live the Squirrels!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gNPJpr9YKj4jqI2uVtLXWTsuySY.jpg", "actors": ["Josh Duvendeck (Doug)", "Kyle S.
