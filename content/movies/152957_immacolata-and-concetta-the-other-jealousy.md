Immacolata is married, is bisexual, and runs a butcher shop that is not bringing in much money. Concetta is a lesbian, doing manual labor and now serving time for taking a potshot at her lover\u2019s husband. Immacolata has also been put in jail for guiding a young woman into prostitution. Immacolata and Concetta develop an intensely passionate relationship in prison and after being released, they defy Immacolata\u2019s husband and society\u2019s scorn by moving in together. But external threats are not as destructive, in the end, as internal contradictions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wcMyu8rz4ZKqR6ysSchSwyut0kW.jpg", "actors": ["Ida Di Benedetto (Immacolata)", "Marcella Michelangeli (Concetta)", "Tommaso Bianco (Ciro)", "Lucio Allocca ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
