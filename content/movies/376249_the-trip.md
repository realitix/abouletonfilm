There are sub-plots also, mainly relating to the life of the poor city dwellers, social injustice and seeming double standards.  Aliki Vougiouklaki is a poor young girl dreaming of a better life and the \"handsome prince on a white stallion\" who will deliver her from her miserable existence.  She meets and falls in love with a young man (Nikos Kourkoulos) who also falls in love with her, but things are not as simple as they first seem.  His past comes to haunt them with tragic consequences.  Vassilis Diamantopoulos is excellent as the half-crazed old captain whose life strangely echoes that of young Aliki.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i1Nw4J6D0qc77lNtF6d7E5yKyj6.jpg", "actors": ["Aliki Vougiouklaki (Marina)", "Nikos Kourkoulos (Stefanos)", "Vasilis Diamantopoulos (Manolis)", "Eleni Zafeiriou (mitera tis Marinas)", "Margarita Labrinou (Athina)", "Lili Papayanni (Soula)", "Sapfo Notara ()", "Zoi Fytousi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
