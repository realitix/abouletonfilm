This geisha story is often described as a loose remake of Mizoguchi\u2019s pre-war masterpiece Sisters of Gion (1936), but this is inexact. Whereas in Mizoguchi\u2019s study of two sisters, both women had been geisha, in Yoshimura\u2019s film only Kimicho (Kyo Machiko) is, while her sister works in the Kyoto tourist office. Juxtaposing a traditional Kyoto profession with a modern one, Yoshimura shows how life in the old capital was changing in the wake of wider transformations in Japanese society.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aBd91KgdjNYXiDN0BgdigF5GoyZ.jpg", "actors": ["Machiko Ky\u014d ()", "Keiju Kobayashi ()", "Yasuko Fujita ()", "Emiko Yanagi ()", "Taeko Kitakouchi ()", "Chigusa Maki ()", "Ichir\u00f4 Sugai ()", "Eitar\u00f4 Shind\u00f4 ()", "Seizabur\u00f4 Kawazu ()", "Chieko Murata ()", "Hisako Takihana ()", "Taiji Tonoyama ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
