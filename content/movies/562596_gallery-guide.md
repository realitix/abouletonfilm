The museum is appropriately impossible in its scope, as Atherton playfully acknowledges the imaginative space of virtual worlds. The fantasy exhibitors have free rein in their show, \u201cFour Rooms and a Toilet,\u201d even to the point of cutting windows in partitions, exposing the building\u2019s masonry, and breaking down the wall between the sex-segregated toilets. Atherton, as the gallery guide, justifies each of the artists\u2019 disruptive requests in high-art terminology as we \u201cmove\u201d through the rooms.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
