This film centres on his unparalleled stardom, revealing how, alongside one of the most staggering musical careers in history, he has received rave reviews for his acting abilities, launched a clothing range, signed superstars like 50 Cent to his own record label, and grabbed the headlines with his explosive behaviour at every given opportunity.
