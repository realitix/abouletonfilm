Fortunately for Cassie, she works in a lab that has just created a serum to treat this disruptive condition. However, when subjects in the trial for this new drug start dropping dead, she uncovers a conspiracy that sends her on a dangerous pursuit of the truth. Will she fall asleep on the job? Let's hope not -- she's got a lot of bullets (and sleep-deprived hallucinations) to dodge along her road to justice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8fay0AXUHqqBr78bwwnM3QBCu5Z.jpg", "actors": ["Missy Peregrym (Cassie Wade)", "Scott Wickware (Detective Logan)", "Joseph Di Mambro (Detective Charlie Andrews)", "Anthony Lemke (Robert Turner)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
