Guy Clark, David Allen Coe, Charlie Daniels and more are featured. Townes Van Zandt really steals the show, though. Out in his ratty trailer he's shown drinking whiskey and shooting bb guns. He sits down in the kitchen and plays some songs for his girlfriend and his elderly black neighbor, Uncle Seymour Washington (whose interactions with Townes are amazing) and plays some of the most amazing music you'll ever hear. There are also some great scenes of a little local ensemble playing in a bar. This is a must-see film for fans of Real Country Music\u2122.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w3p7py4112t7HREqDpAN4nG2cr3.jpg", "actors": ["Townes Van Zandt (Himself)", "Steve Earle (Himself)", "David Allan Coe (Himself)", "Peggy Brooks (Herself)", "Guy Clark (Himself)", "Rodney Crowell (Himself)", "Charlie Daniels (Himself)", "Wayne Moss (Himself (as Barefoot Jerry))", "Gamble Rogers (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "kFh4DebJAfs"}
