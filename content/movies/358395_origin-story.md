He's not your real dad.\" Twenty years later, she's finally ready to learn what that means. ORIGIN STORY is a feature-length, international quest with stops in Los Angeles, Minnesota, and Laos to meet the biological father she never knew. On the road, unforeseen revelations strike as hilarious or heartbreaking, rarely in between. An avid comic book reader with a vigilante character named after her in the DC Comics universe, she must summon the courage of Katharsis, because each question is another step out on a limb. ORIGIN STORY is a deeply personal but universally relevant tale of immigration, conflict, addiction, and personal responsibility. Interviewees in the film include extended family, husband Scott Aukerman, and close friends, like Sarah Silverman, Casey Wilson, June Diane Raphael and Howard Kremer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qSK2Lf0BdQEZbgkmEkncaff7Ux6.jpg", "actors": ["Kulap Vilaysack (Herself)", "Scott Aukerman (Himself)", "Casey Wilson (Herself)", "June Diane Raphael (Herself)", "Howard Kremer (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "pWdH8CquCRY"}
