It is, poignantly, a film about one man's drive, in an increasingly dire American psyche, to overcome the most trenchant of odds, and redefine his fate in a quest to provide a more solid future for self and family than his own meager inheritances would have allowed. Jens Pulver's story is everyone's story. And it is why Jens Pulver is so loved by fight fans around the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f9TNFI0XytFchIJr4c7evz23V4R.jpg", "actors": ["Kannika Pulver (Herself)", "Abel Pulver (Himself)", "Ricky Christian (Himself)", "Tony Fryklund (Himself)", "Jens Pulver (Himself)", "Scott Jorgensen (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "dYgwLofk7j4"}
