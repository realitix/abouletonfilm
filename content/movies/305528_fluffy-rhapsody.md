He becomes caught between his flight attendant girlfriend who is often away and a high school girl who claims to be a lesbian. A mixture of fast living and brooding melancholy, Fluffy Rhapsody is an engaging, photogenic essay on the current generation of seemingly thoughtless, but in fact overly introspective urban youth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wM4q0LthJVnoRye7Cso4AmHKcLw.jpg", "actors": ["Yu-chen Chang ()", "Pinky Juan ()", "Chen-Liang Tsai ()", "Yee Chin-Yen ()", "Sandrine Pinna ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
