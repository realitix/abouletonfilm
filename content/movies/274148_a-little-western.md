Spilling patches of colors are arranged in the form of cowboys and horses, creating a surprising and brilliant parody of the western. Animation is also an intriguing self-comment: the viewer watches not only the struggle between good and evil, but also the process of creating a film world. Made in 1960, the award-winning Little Western is the first fully auteur movie in the history of Polish animation - the director and screenwriter in one person also took care of the visual development of the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nVUSdcKuQr2M7DDa7jMsQX2DXd6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "6D3Wq6ujd48"}
