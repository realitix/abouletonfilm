Filmed in both Manhattan and Brazil and set against the background of the Vietnam War and its protests, Hunger for Love uses a rigorously abstract soundtrack and narrative structure to evoke the acute paranoia of the period building up to the December 1968 military coup that tipped Brazil perilously close to a conservative dictatorship. With its harsh critique of the decadent tendencies of the Sixties counterculture, Hunger for Love offers a key expression of the self-consciously \u201cideological\u201d phase of Cinema Novo. -Harvard Film Archive", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hTed8ep7NC2wJ4ONNb8YOba3w2P.jpg", "actors": ["Ardu\u00edno Colassanti ()", "Manfredo Colassanti ()", "Leila Diniz ()", "Irene Stef\u00e2nia ()", "Neville de Almeida ()", "Paulo Porto ()", "Lia Rossi ()", "Olga Danitch ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
