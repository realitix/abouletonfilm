She frequently refuses to part with her merchandise because of its sentimental value, but she does agree to sell some items to two small boys, Alby and Chris , who are repairing a hot air balloon that belonged to the older boy's grandfather, a stunt man named The Great Sandusky. They plan to take the balloon aloft to celebrate the man's birthday.
