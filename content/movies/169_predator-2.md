Yet I personally feel that Predator 2 stands up to scrutiny as a fine entry into the sci-fi/action genre, locating it amongst the urban decay of L.A. works real well, and pitting the Predator against a tough grizzled (but hardly giganticus beefcakeus) cop (Danny Glover) gives us a smart brains against brawn story. Also cutely is that director Stephen Hopkins and writers Jim & John Thomas have actually got the Predator cleaning up the streets of L.A., in fact another two hours of Predator hunt and kill tactics and crime in L.A. would have been completely eradicated! There is plenty of bloody snotty gore to appease fans of that persuasion, and it's nice to report that the characters on show do actually impact as part of the story.\r\n\r\nIt has a fine cast that reads like a who's who of action films, Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon), Bill Paxton (Aliens), Robert Davi (Die Hard), Gary Busey (Under Siege), Rub\u00e9n Blades (Once Upon a Time in Mexico) & Maria Conchita Alonso (The Running Man0, whilst Kevin Peter Hall dons the Preadtor suit and suitably kicks arse again. It's not genius, it's not even ground breaking, but Predator 2 is a fine and entertaining genre piece that sadly seems to forever be undervalued on internet sites.\r\n\r\n8/10 \"who's next\"?"}, {"pseudo": "Gimly", "content": "When I was younger I always hated _Predator 2_. Rewatching it as an adult, I don't think it was fair how bad I thought it was. It's not that _Predator 2_ is crap, it's just that it's **so much worse** than the original (one of the 5 best movies ever made), that it comes across as such a massive disappointment. With fresh, or I guess more accurately, with more experienced eyes, I don't mind _Predator 2_ at all, there's actually a lot of stuff I like about it. It's still not a great movie to me, but I don't skip it when I'm doing a marathon like I would have once upon a time. It expands upon the Predator lore in some pretty cool ways, and the Jamaican Voodoo Posse inspired my Escher Necromunda gang, so I've wound up pretty 50/50 on the whole thing.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"}], "recommandations_id": [34851, 440, 106, 395]}
