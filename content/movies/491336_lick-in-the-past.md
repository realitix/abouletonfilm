These trance-like confessions and conversations are inter-cut with images of squid and fish, which \u2013 together with glimpses of Prouvost\u2019s body and the landscape of LA \u2013 form a poetic road movie about the vague promises and wistful possibilities of youth.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
