Pulp-serial snippets, industrial-film imagery, and B- (and Z-) fiction clips are intercut with newly shot live-action material, powering a playful, allegorical trajectory through the now-mythic occult matrix of Jack Parsons (Crowleyite founder of the Jet Propulsion Lab), L.Ron Hubbard (sci-fi author turned cult-leader), and Marjorie Cameron (bohemian artist and \"mother of the New Age movement\"). Their intertwined tales spin out into a speculative farce on the militarization of space, and the corporate take-over of spiritual fulfillment and leisure-time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bfL66a8c2PFWbMfJ8eSquSykkTD.jpg", "actors": ["Damon Packard (L.
