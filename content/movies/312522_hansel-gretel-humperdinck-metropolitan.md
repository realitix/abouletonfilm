The Met's storybook production cheerfully evokes a magic world of woodland sprites and candy dreams and yet brings as well the entire apparatus of Wagnerian music and drama to bear on a German fairy tale. This production is sung in English, and features the Metropolitan Opera, Chorus, and Ballet.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rqsluTImpjAf9sTDIod23WXf9jl.jpg", "actors": ["Frederica von Stade (Hansel)", "Judith Blegen (Gretel)", "Jean Kraft (Gertrude)", "Michael Devlin (Peter)", "Diane Kesling (The Sandman)", "Betsy Norden (The Dew Fairy)", "Rosalind Elias (The Witch)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
