He doesn't look or talk like an athlete but make no mistake, Rockhammer is a professional athlete. \"Unflinching Triumph\" immerses the audience into the life of Philip and the underground world of Professional Staredown. From Phlip's breakout success, to his tense showdowns with Staredown legend Tony Patterson, and his confrontations with his personal demons, we're with him all the way. Philip's voyage is at times joyous, often nerve-racking and occasionally heart-breaking. \"Unflinching Triumph\" provides an illuminating look at a man we never knew and a sport we never knew existed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cCRzL0M2OWw0sJPt4uSks99rgnx.jpg", "actors": ["Dave Dyson (Alex Everett)", "Robert Lambrechts (Philip Rockhammer)", "Jon Carlo (T J Greg Doyle)", "Brandon Ray Connor (Kensington Montgomery III)", "Stephen John Turner (Ernie Armstrong)", "Bob Brindley (Tony Patterson)", "Mark Decena (JR McCord)", "Joe Mandragona (Peter McAllister)", "Greg Ayers (Billy)", "Robert Anthony Peters (Cousin Donnie)", "Linda Ayres-Fredrick (Angela Rockhammer)", "Nicole Buckenmeyer (Rebecca Rockhammer)", "Nanrisa Lee (Crissy Smithfield)", "Marcus Samuelsson (Rorrie Rodgers)", "John Halfacre (The Bishop Al Harris (as John Christopher Halfacre))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
