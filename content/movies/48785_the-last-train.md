He is a doctor who has just been called up we learn eventually. This is the end of the line- the Germans are about to retreat. He goes to a hospital which is being evacuated and is thrown out. Kicked out he wanders with another conscript- a failed actor turned postman. The postman is deafened by a shell explosion. They meet their Russian equivalents, others as bad at killing as they are, while other Russians and Germans kill one another around them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wMwTZUyUlAgIJkHbJMjCM8xxuZ6.jpg", "actors": ["Pavel Romanov ()", "Pyotr Merkuryev ()", "Aleksei Merkuryev ()", "Natalya Lvova ()", "Aleksey Devotchenko ()", "Irina Rakshina ()", "Alexander Tyurin ()", "Oleg Fedorov ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
