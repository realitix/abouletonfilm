She believes she is invincible - but one man is destined to change that. He is a man bound by oath to avenge the wrongs inflicted on his home and, in pursuit of revenge, he will stop at nothing. Hannibal explores the man behind the myth, revealing what drove the 26-year-old to mastermind one of the most audacious military moves in history. With 40,000 soldiers and 37 elephants, he marched 1,500 miles to challenge his enemies on their own soil. It was an act so daring that few people believed it possible.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ky9DxOgK6j8m8wqWP5L0IM0Sb5l.jpg", "actors": ["Alexander Siddig (Hannibal)", "Emilio Doorgasingh (Maharbal)", "Bashar Rahal (Hasdrubal)", "Mido Hamada (Mago)", "Shaun Dingwall (Scipio)", "Rob Dixon (Publius Scipio)", "Tristan Gemmill (Varro)", "Vincent Riotta (Hanno)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
