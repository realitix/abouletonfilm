This required close views of the performer's lip movements. The project was given to Demen\u00ff by \u00c9tienne-Jules Marey, who headed the Station Physiologique in Paris and whose chronophotographic scientific research of motion is among the most important contributions to the invention of movies. Despite these educational and scientific beginnings, however, this project led Demen\u00ff to pursue and influence the commercialism of cinema.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1JRfyJuFjVhHJdD5b0OtEgmgelX.jpg", "actors": ["Georges Demen\u00ff (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [159910, 159903, 159908, 319603], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
