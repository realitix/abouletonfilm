Before her arrival, the Latin maid casually enters Jack the father's bed and sleeps with him while his oblivious wife Jeanette is in the very next room talking to him. The rich family is bankrupt and so Jeanette plans to get her son Rick married to the promising actress Brooke. She sets up a dinner but her porn actress daughter Jill is late after the family's handyman complies to practice a scene with her. When she finally arrives, Brooke already left to talk with Jeanette's niece Mark, whose mother Billie also counts on him marrying Brooke. Jeanette, who gives up on the dinner in frustration, tells the handyman to sleep with her or else get fired, only to end up firing him anyway for bad performance. But at night, it is the older Jack with whom Brooke fantasizes about sleeping.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tNfC3ninrBuLXilFDXrblLURXB5.jpg", "actors": ["Brooke Fields (Brooke Fields)", "Vanessa del Rio (Juanita)", "Jerry Butler (Rick Rawlings)", "Colleen Brennan (Jeanette Rawlings)", "Chelsea Blake (Billie)", "Danielle (Jill Rawlings)", "George Payne (Boomer)", "Eric Edwards (Jack Rawlings)", "Alan Adrian (Dave Connolly)", "Erica Eaton (Candace)", "Henri Pachard (The Director)", "Jeffrey Wallach (Burton)", "David Scott (Mark)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
