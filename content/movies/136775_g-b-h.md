Before joining the force he ran with a football firm, getting involved in tear-ups up and down the country. Now he's on the other side of the law and faces a tough decision, side with his old crew or protect London as it burns and rioters run amok. Falling in love with fellow cop Louise, he is quickly alerted to a street-level uprising that is about to shake London. Amidst the brutalities presented by the riots, he fights for justice at Louise's expense. Having been raped by a rioter known to him, Damien finds himself levelling with the rioters, fighting a war he cannot win, as much against the rioters as against himself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rjWznygaHM4I61MHi8QYtLmYrZR.jpg", "actors": ["Nick Nevern (Damien)", "Kellie Shirley (Louise)", "Jenna Harrison (Sarah)", "Con O'Neill (Patrick)", "Steven Berkoff (Chief Constable)", "Roland Manookian (Steve)", "Peter Barrett (Barry)", "Lorraine Stanley (Drake's Mother)", "Mark Harris (Jason)", "Charlie Bond (Hilary)", "Merveille Lukeba (Kyle)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [85566, 286491, 92416, 12216], "youtube_key": "qicdi1aVQh0"}
