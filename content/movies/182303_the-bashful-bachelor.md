Lum is also too timid to propose to Geraldine, so he involves Abner in a \"rescue\" effort which nearly gets both of them killed. They try again, and this time Geraldine is impressed. Lum writes a proposal note, but Abner, by mistake, delivers it to the Widder Abernathy, who has been ready to remarry for years. This puts Lum in a peck of trouble until the sheriff appears with the Widder's long-gone and hiding husband.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2nBbdBSSiNIe6cFtKSyYMS7XNkj.jpg", "actors": ["Chester Lauck (Lum Edwards)", "Norris Goff (Abner Peabody)", "Zasu Pitts (Geraldine)", "Grady Sutton (Cedric Wiehunt)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
