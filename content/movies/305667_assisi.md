The images then create a sort of stroll in front of the art of Giotto and Cimabue. A procession of monks with the candles are the only human elements that stand out in the representation of the city and its architecture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5xqzssopXp6gNkmiuZBqeNladG9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
