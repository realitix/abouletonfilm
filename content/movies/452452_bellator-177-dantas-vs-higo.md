The main event was originally scheduled to feature Eduardo Dantas against Darrion Caldwell, but Caldwell withdrew due to injury. Leandro Higo stepped in as a replacement. Due to the short notice, the fight was changed from a Bantamweight title bout to a non-title contest at a catchweight of 139 pounds.  Bellator Kickboxing 6 was headlined by a Welterweight world title rematch featuring Zoltan Laszak against Karim Ghajji.
