{"tmdb_id": 477931, "title": "Sugar Water", "original_title": "Sugar Water", "slug_title": "sugar-water", "date": "2007-01-01", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "The action takes place on a Paris metro platform where a billposter covers a large advertising billboard with a sequence of images that depict a car parked on a Parisian street that bursts into flames, becomes swallowed up in smoke, and then remains only as a skeleton of the former car. Using a laborious traditional system to mount the details of each image, this cinematic event gradually unfolds over the 72-minute film, offering a slow contemplative consideration of political violence as a counterpoint to the rapid barrage of images we typically experience in our news media. Despite its slow, nearly meditative pace, Baudelaire creates a haunting and provocative work that completely absorbs the viewer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wTB9nA3ZhnPEmXRzEyBmsREje7t.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
