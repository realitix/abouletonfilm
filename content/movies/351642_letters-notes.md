And yet the elusive poignancy that emerges of this exquisite corpse structure is richly suggestive of the roots of narrative. If a code is a \"reduced version of lang.\" (as one of the more enigmatic notes reads) then Barber\u2019s film might be said to explore the possibilities of decoding: specifically, how cinema makes it possible to rewrite sounds and images as emotions. LETTERS, NOTES is another remarkable selection from the Cinemad Almanac.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kMWpTjUdfMWrKM6CX9OFUj5XEUr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
