In spite of its shaky reputation this isn\u2019t half bad, it delivers what most Van Damme fans expect, namely bonkers fights and shifty science. Plot has Van Damme as a fire obsessed serial killer who is always one step ahead of the police. Enter science as a chance to clone the killer arises and this sets in motion the wheels of the Van Damme clone trying to come to terms with his alien world as he, and world weary police officer Jake Riley (Michael Rooker), set about capturing the unhinged mad man.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s of course daft but it\u2019s a whole bunch of fun, and with the strong presence of Rooker supplemented by two very interesting performances by Van Damme, pic is in good hands. The fight scenes are smoothly choreographed and exciting, with director Ringo Lam clearly aware of what makes a Van Damme movie work. It\u2019s not prime Van Damme, but it\u2019s above average and well worth checking out for those so inclined. 6/10"}], "recommandations_id": [10861, 37632, 37498, 10413]}
