She asks Fred, her sleazy boss, if she can work more hours - but instead, he takes on sexy air-head, Sharon and fires Joan. Now, she's forced to resort to extreme measures to avoid her home being repossessed. Aided by Sharon, and her two friends/former work-mates (65 year-old eccentric Enid, and desperate Mavis), Joan becomes the Madame of a do-it-yourself co-operative brothel... A brothel with no sex!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8QixTmYp742JrZE766gPpPC6hCW.jpg", "actors": ["Jeni Howarth Williams (Joan)", "Sophia Hatfield (Sharon)", "Denice Hope (Mavis)", "Caroline Melliar-Smith (Enid)", "Paul Sockett (Officer Jackson)", "Jimmy Allen (Officer Jackson)", "David Corden (Phil)", "Shireen Ashton (Cherie)", "Candice Edwards-Marchrones (Liana)", "Sian Hill (Chantelle)", "Nina Johnston (Purgita)", "Kati J\u00e4gel (Anna)", "Anna Krippa (Oksana)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "zkMXd4rRbj8"}
