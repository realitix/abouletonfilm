The weather was all that could be desired, and the films are, therefore, very fine photographically. There are five scenes in all, as follows: 5. President Roosevelt on the Reviewing Stand. This is a great film. It shows the President as he is entering the reviewing stand, follows him to the reviewing position, and then gives a swinging panorama of Union Square, with its immense throng of spectators.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
