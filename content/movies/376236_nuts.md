And that\u2019s just the tipping point in this stranger-than-fiction tale. With the balls of a P.T. Barnum, the gonads of goats, and the wishful dreams of flaccid men, Brinkley amassed a fortune, was almost elected Governor of Kansas, invented junk mail and the infomercial, and built the world\u2019s most powerful radio station. By the time all of the twists and turns of Brinkley\u2019s story are revealed, Nuts! certainly earns its title.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rytoWiX1qVM0B1MvfAWwMGulKT6.jpg", "actors": ["Gene Tognacci (The Narrator)", "Andy Boswell (Various Voices)", "John Causby (Various Voices)", "Kelly Mizell (Various Voices)", "Jeff Pillars (Various Voices)", "Thom Stylinski (Various Voices)", "Fran Taylor (Various Voices)", "Pope Brok (Himself)", "Gene Fowler (Himself)", "Dr. James Reardon (Himself)", "Megan Seaholm (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [169479, 27242, 186328, 69600], "youtube_key": "XPBJRIPGPI8"}
