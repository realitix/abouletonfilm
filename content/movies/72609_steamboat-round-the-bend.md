But Duke's only chance for freedom is the testimony of a half-crazed witness, New Moses, who has disappeared upriver. With time running out - and Pearly's rival Captain Eli itching to race his paddle wheeler, the Pride of Paducah, against Pearly's steamboat, the Claremore Queen - Pearly sets off on a wild race to find New Moses, free Duke...and lasso a win for the Claremore Queen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sIGOwmDGtXWLVm3upU3MG8eCUne.jpg", "actors": ["Will Rogers (Doctor John Pearly)", "Anne Shirley (Fleety Belle)", "Irvin S.
