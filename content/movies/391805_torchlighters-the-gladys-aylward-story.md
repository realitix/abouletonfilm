But it's not her own safety that concerns this little woman with big faith. It's the safety and well being of the 100 orphaned children in her care. Watch as Gladys' strength and faith are stretched to the limit, all for the sake of the children.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3gS5QDr3GqvYSOLZZbJtqAjHIy5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
