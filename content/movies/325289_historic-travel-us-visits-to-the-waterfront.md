Some believe that the name Coney Island originated from Dutch names like \"Konjn Kok\" which later evolved to Coney. Others feel the conical shaped sand bars that form along the shoreline inspired sailors to call it Coney Island.This Video provides a glimpse of what it was like to be on the famous island in the 50s. It also enables you to have a close look at the magnificent natural wonder-the Niagara Falls and see what the famous Manhattan waterfront looked like in the early part of the 20th century.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
