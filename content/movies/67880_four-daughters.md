Of the four, Kay has the greatest promise as a musical performer, specifically as a singer. Theirs is a loving family, however much the girls exasperate their father with their love of popular music, since he loves only the classics, most specifically Beethoven. The girls support each other however they can, but each is an individual with her own distinct personality and wants, including the type of man each wants as a husband. Practical but deep in her heart romantic Emma has long been courted by their next door neighbor, unassuming florist Ernest Talbot, and clever Thea wants to be Mrs. Ben Crowley, he a wealthy up and coming banker with prospects. Only the youngest, the fun loving Ann, states that she doesn't want to get married.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kH43yj36gVMAXXrZHttEAMyYbxp.jpg", "actors": ["Claude Rains (Adam Lemp)", "John Garfield (Mickey Borden)", "Priscilla Lane (Ann Lemp)", "May Robson (Aunt Etta)", "Lola Lane (Thea Lemp)", "Rosemary Lane (Kay Lemp)", "Gale Page (Emma Lemp)", "Frank McHugh (Ben Crowley)", "Jeffrey Lynn (Felix Deitz)", "Dick Foran (Ernest)", "Vera Lewis (Mrs. Ridgefield)", "Tom Dugan (Jake)", "Eddie Acuff (Sam)", "Donald Kerr (Earl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [13847, 61647, 84295, 113080], "youtube_key": "ClsfBZhViU0"}
