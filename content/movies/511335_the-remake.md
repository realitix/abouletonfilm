What they didn't know was that their on-screen chemistry would translate into a hot and heavy off-screen romance destined only for disaster. Now, living continents apart and a lifetime later, expecting their paths never to cross again, they are thrown back together to star in an updated version of their original film. The studio has high hopes that they will be able to attract the same audience who loved them the first time around. But working together again could demand greater acting skills than either ever imagined: long hours filming awkward romantic scenes, reliving the past and coming face to face with what fate has in store for them. Only slightly shaken and gently stirred by family and friends, Sheridan and Riccardo must find a way to make the perfect martini out of life so as not to waste a single drop of happiness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yubngQSAhehExcLQqTHA75pPPKF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ZdM0iQqqNgA"}
