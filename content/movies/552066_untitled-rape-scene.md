Blood is smeared over and drips down her buttocks, thighs and calves and a pool of it is partially visible on the dark floor beside her feet. The scene is dramatically lit, highlighting her legs, the side of her body and the table, and casting strong shadows onto the wall behind her. Her head and her arms, which are tied to the table, are not visible in the darkness; broken crockery and bloodied clothes disappear into the shadows on the floor to her right.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c5aayw4u1w2ln4ovY6bNCSnQpqU.jpg", "actors": ["Ana Mendieta (Object)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
