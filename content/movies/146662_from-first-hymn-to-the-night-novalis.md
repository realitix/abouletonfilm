The pieces of text which I've used are as follows: \u2018the universally gladdening light \u2026 As inmost soul \u2026 it is breathed by stars \u2026 by stone \u2026 by suckling plant \u2026 multiform beast \u2026 and by (you).

Night opens in us \u2026 infinite eyes \u2026 blessed love.\u2019\u201d -SB", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/44ZEsFbhiSfTLKGMw8uzOXnMg2m.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [146693, 126197, 152304, 145619], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
