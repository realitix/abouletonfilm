Norfolk Southern's busy Pittsburgh Line traverses the state of Pennsylvania from Harrisburg to Pittsburgh. This popular mainline, originally built by the Pennsylvania Railroad, crosses the Allegheny mountain range and is a central artery for east-to-west commerce. It is also the home of the world famous Horseshoe Curve. This program focuses on the portion of this mainline from Altoona to Cresson - known as \"The East Slope\".
