It is an historic running through the technical and artistic evolution of the 7th art. We move from mute to sound, from B&amp;W to color, trough all the genders (musical, Lyric, politic...). Beside it we have a kind of resume of the historic contest in which cinema lived till now, events and movements (neo-realism, classical etc.).
