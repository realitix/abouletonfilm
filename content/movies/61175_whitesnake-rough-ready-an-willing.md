The band's early material has been compared by critics to Deep Purple, but by the mid 1980s they had moved to a more commercial heavy metal style. Whitesnake was named the 85th greatest hard rock band of all time by VH1.[1] Although for many years classed as an English rock band, all the members of the current incarnation of the band, except Coverdale, are American born.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t10tbfIvXefnjutQ9lgfg9q5Sgz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
