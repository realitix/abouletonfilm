And this kitty's not so cool he can't get a little scared, like when he, Jon and Odie discover that a closed-down haunted house is really open, or that leftovers occasionally ran rampant in the fridge. Garfield has a big imagination, too, as you'll see when he imagines himself as a fish or a werewolf, or even Jon for a day!  There's much more to the fat cat's story, so grab some pasta, flop on the couch and tune in for some cat-toon fun with Garfield!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u5SspHB0FZBLqc3mKjzka5Eqsya.jpg", "actors": ["Lorenzo Music (Garfield)", "Thom Huge (Voice 1)", "Howie Morris (Voice 2)", "Gregg Berger (Voice 3)", "Julie Payne (Voice 4)", "Gary Owens (Voice 5)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
