Acclaimed Fokofpolisiekar and African Cypher director (and two-time Encounters Audience Award winner) Little recruited musicians, sculptors, artists, a coastal forager, underwater wildlife filmmakers, conservation biologists, drone pilots \u2013 to spend 10 days and nights at a camp site where they surfed, created artworks, and worked with the local community, celebrating that coast and ocean.
