The young Maximiliane Frey is his assistant and they have worked side by side for years helping people.  Holzgruber repeatedly points out the dangers of radiation to Maximiliane, but is silent about the ulcers on his hand and the severe pain they have caused.  Maximiliane has gotten to know the widower Axel von Bonin and has fallen in love with him.  But then she is diagnosed with incurable cancer.  To spare Axel the inevitable grief over her impending death, she leaves him and dedicates what is left her life to medicine.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Paula Wessely (Maximiliane Frey)", "Mathias Wieman (Dr. Paul Holzgruber)", "Werner Hinz (Freiherr von Bonin)", "Franz B\u00f6heim (Erich)", "Erik Frey (Robert)", "Rolf Truxa (Leopold Welischer)", "Alfred Neugebauer (Sanit\u00e4tsrat Wendemuth)", "Karl Skraup (Herr Welischer)", "Lotte Lang (Emma Welischer)", "Ernst Pr\u00f6ckl (Fritz)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
