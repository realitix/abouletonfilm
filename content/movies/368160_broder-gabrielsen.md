The film points a strong warning against religious fanaticism and against contemporary preachers, and it met then also strong opposition from some of these . In the film we meet the piecemeal lay preacher , Brother Gabrielsen ( ALF MALLAND ) , who discovers how modern music , rhythms and ecstasy gives great success when it comes to getting listeners to his preaching . He will soon get his big break , and keeps ecstatic revival meetings with tongues and \" healings \" through prayer . It ends in discouragement and defeat then wonders absent for Gabrielsen , and personal tragedies for those who were misguided .", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wjePACrYGHDewHkwsBg2Rtz4MzD.jpg", "actors": ["Alf Malland (Broder Gabrielsen)", "Mette Lange-Nielsen (Lina Gabrielsen)", "Per Christensen (Doktor Hermansen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
