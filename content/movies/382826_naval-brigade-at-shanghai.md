In the film story, Japan's marine regiment protects Japanese residents and Chinese refugees-women and young children-from rampant street fighting, Shanhai Rikusentai unsparingly uses its first eight minutes for an official-mannered self-justification of the war. From the viewpoint of explaining Japan's military operation,the narration refers to the city s spatial division in sync with maps on screen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pzvARRwTxkXnMLkaoBA3i19ivCQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
