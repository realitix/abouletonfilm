Rimbaud was always one of Nolan\u2019s heroes. Over the years he painted many pictures of the poet. The famous artist responded enthusiastically to a suggestion by an Australian scriptwriter for a film about Rimbaud and he produced 31 large new paintings for this film together with many small crayon drawings.  These works, interwoven with a wealth of drawings paintings, photographs and documents from the Louvre, the French National Library and the Rimbaud Museum at Charleville, have been combined in a filmic evocation of one of France\u2019s most extraordinary writers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mbiH3dcj47QCsiUeEFJCknafNso.jpg", "actors": ["Zoe Caldwell (Narrator)", "Sidney Nolan (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
