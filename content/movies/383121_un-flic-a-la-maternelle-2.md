Reed also has little time for new fangled politically correct ways of teaching.\r\n\r\nHowever Reed slowly bonds with the kids as he learns how to connect with them, he also falls for a fellow teacher and confronts with the Russian baddie.\r\n\r\nHowever this is straight to pay tv fodder, with a weak script. Although Lundgren can be a good dramatic actor, he is left with little to do here."}], "recommandations_id": [370835, 18654, 38560, 37850], "youtube_key": "PFZajujTqoE"}
