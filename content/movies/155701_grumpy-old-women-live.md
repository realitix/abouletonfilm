Have you reached that certain age? Are you more likely to be shaking your rolling pin than your booty? Are you a little bit hot, a little bit hairy? Jenny Eclair, Linda Robson and Dillie Keane (whose combined age is unprintable) host an orgy of middle aged mayhem, 90 minutes of theatrical HRT with not a thong in sight.  Recording their first ever live DVD, the original cast members tread the boards of the historic Richmond Theatre creating their biggest grump fest to date!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jenny Eclair (Herself)", "Linda Robson (Herself)", "Dillie Keane (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
