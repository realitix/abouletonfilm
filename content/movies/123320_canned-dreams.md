A dream-like voyage with glimpses of disconcerting realities, the story begins with a single mother toiling in one of the biggest open pit mines in Brazil and ends on the shelf of a grocery store in Finland. Along the way, the workers whose calloused hands mine, raise and harvest each ingredient reveal their dreams and hopes, like the Danish pig farmer who loves his sows but longs for a girlfriend, and the Portuguese tomato picker who wants to stay healthy long enough to pay her daughters way through university. Sumptuous photography and impressive sound design make an eloquent statement about our modern, globalized world, making us aware of the hundreds of invisible people who prepare the food we eat every day. -Gis\u00e8le Gordon (HotDocs.ca)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cwyBaaRT71QSn04OQpMhDGZUrr4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "pFeA1SXARHA"}
