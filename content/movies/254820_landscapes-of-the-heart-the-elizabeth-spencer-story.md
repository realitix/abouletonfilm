Her story is filled with memories and reflections about race, class, and the changing roles of women during a defining mid-century in American history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1rmMKYBetv8tiVQhJRDWqNURnnK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "1eIURjmuEvc"}
