A charismatic loner, Johnny spent a dazzling career behind the scenes in show business without never forming any lasting relationships. Destine to die that way, the film is a subtle dance between a subject who wants to control his legacy, and a filmmaker/family-member who simply wants to know him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gZ51KLvW2RbaP4j5GdP4ctHi76t.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "oqWKCzvqy2I"}
