The production values are also elaborate and the look of the set designs reminds one of the elaborate backdrops that Melies used in his shots.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tXnKJtxVhHwPc5Vj0yVKN46rl70.jpg", "actors": ["Maude Fealy (Iolante, the Blind Girl)", "Harry Benham (Tristan, Count de Vaudemont)", "Robert Broderick (King Ren\u00e9)", "David Thompson (Ebu Jahia, the Moorish Physician)", "Mrs. Lawrence Marston \t.
