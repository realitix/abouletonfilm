What would you do, if your love one never wants to depart. No matter how you kill him. This is not just a romantic tale. It's a horrific love story in the heat of the night.  The film combined local belief of \"PI-POP\" (\u0e1c\u0e35\u0e1b\u0e2d\u0e1a), the flesh eating spirit in the northeastern Thailand, with modern day-domestic violence. In an old apartment, the death of 14 year old school girl suddenly destroyed everyone's life. Some people blamed themselves. Someone simply wanted more blood.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xHEcwIZoB9dMqXsUcZNAGthvi2V.jpg", "actors": ["Sirawat Nak-intanond ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "5ZHHdMOsX_M"}
