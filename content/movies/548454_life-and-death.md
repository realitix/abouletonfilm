The irresistible Yuan Muzhi (director of Street Angel the following year) plays both Li Tao, a revolutionary on the run, and Liu Yuanjie, an American-Chinese teacher visiting China with his fianc\u00e9e. Liu is mistaken for Li and thrown into jail; Li teams up with the fianc\u00e9e (Chen Bo'er, Yuan's real life wife) to get him out of prison and into the spirit of revolution. Ying Yunwei (who started out playing female roles in Chinese opera) uses chiaroscuro lighting, highly mobile camerawork and zippy pacing to give it maximum impact, but it's Yuan who really keeps you watching.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/daUL8NBchzUHurmXKd8ioTYjnLN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
