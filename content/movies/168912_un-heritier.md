In 2010, Jean-Marie Straub returned to the eastern provinces of France, this time to Alsace, to film the second half of a diptych based on Barr\u00e8s\u2019s work. The text is derived from In the Service of Germany, a book about the mountain of Saint-Odile, which Barr\u00e8s wrote in 1903. With Joseph Rottner in the principal role, Straub traces the path of a young country doctor as he tours Mont Saint-Odile, following the routes that Barr\u00e8s himself took to the chateau of Ratsamhausen and around the ruins of the ancient fortification known as the \"Pagan Wall,\u201d which are unique in the area. Straub, himself born in Metz, plays the role of a resident of Lorraine whom the young Alsatian engages in conversation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qdQMJ5Hy5kBNB93NlQ0P5J5l3n8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
