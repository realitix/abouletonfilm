But he is not the boy who disappeared over 10 years ago. Tortured and abused at the hands of his psychotic captor, Graham Sutter, Martin is damaged beyond repair. Lurking in the shadows of suburbia, he stalks and kills without remorse. Special Agent William Perkins follows Martin's trail of terror, desperate to capture him before he kills again. Martin's family, mourning his disappearance for over 10 years, is informed not only that he is alive, but that he is responsible for the wave of murder sweeping through their town. Will they be able to reunite with their long lost son before it's too late, or will Perkins have to use excessive force to bring him down?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gJlsbI4OvBoMpKMU0VAg2RDbK8U.jpg", "actors": ["Katie Gibson (Ellie)", "Kevin McKelvy (Agent Perkins)", "Victoria Mena (Victoria)", "Adrienne Barbeau (Meredith Bristol)", "Ashley Wolfe (Katherine Bristol)", "Scott Decker (Agent Roland)", "Reed Davis (Tom)", "Graceann Dorse (Agent Jones)", "David Lee Madison (Agent Smith)", "Lynn Mastio Rice (Georgianna Pritchett)", "Jay Cohen (Martin Bristol)", "Alli Caudle (Lynn)", "Kelsey Deanne (Tara)", "Scott Kay (John)", "Todd Litzinger (Simon)", "Andy Striph (Carl)", "Keith B.
