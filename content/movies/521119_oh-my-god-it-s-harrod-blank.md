From his youth growing up in the woods with chickens and working as a camera assistant for his father- the venerable film-maker Les Blank- to the creation of his first attention-getting artcar, to his current multi-faceted career as creator and head of a nationwide art car movement, all the while pursuing his visions of non-conformity. Featuring interviews with his girl-friends, his mom, his brother, his raconteur lifelong pal, Kevin, as well as Blank\u2019s own painful yet hilarious self-examinations. With special appearances by Les Blank and many fine art car artists. \u201cThe pressure to conform is incredible, \u201d says Blank, \u201cbut I don\u2019t care what other people think. The reason I\u2019m alive is to create.\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nuLanzJnLsAvsO2kezAly8p79J7.jpg", "actors": ["Harrod Blank (Self)", "Les Blank (Self)", "David Endres (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
