The next phase in their relationship is initiated as they only get naked on her fertile days. But does she really want it? The big picture? Or rather be wild and free? When the questions in her head get too loud, she hits the 'mute' button. Until she finds herself in a chalet in the mountains, with three others. Learning that no decisions are decisions. Running away is no option, so it gets straight down to the nitty-gritty.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7myymrHr6begIAybVmLtVahhlma.jpg", "actors": ["Julia Becker (Marie)", "Marc Benjamin Puch (Sascha)", "Christian Natter (Lukas)", "Charlotte Crome (Birgit)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [275509, 457602, 537376, 428975], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
