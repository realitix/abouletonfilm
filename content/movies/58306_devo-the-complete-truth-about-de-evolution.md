Punk/New Wave mad scientists Devo were among the few bands to understand the music video's potential as art form during its infancy in the eighties. Their brilliant and bizarre videos were compiled on VHS and then on laser disc; that long out-of-print disc, The Complete Truth About De-Evolution, has finally arrived on DVD, which should please longtime fans of this eclectic outfit.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tD8LaiabYerIqdScbZKvNC5jf74.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Mothersbaugh (Himself)", "Gerald V.
