The visual world of The Arcadian is an homage to the work of underground illustrators while creating something that is both unique and distinctive. Inspired in equal parts by samurai movies, rock operas, and underground comics, filming took place across four states (New York, New Jersey, California, Florida) as well as Nova Scotia, Canada to get the \"feel\" of the film's disjointed apocalypse right.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pGRYBKIawxCNWaK4u1FhFVU92MM.jpg", "actors": ["J.
