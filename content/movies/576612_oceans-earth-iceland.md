Follow the journey of Henthorne as he traverses Iceland on a journey to capture that perfect Black & White fotograph.  Ocean & Earth Iceland captures those special places where huge waves from the North Atlantic are lapping up on jet black volcanic beaches. The short film provides a behind the scenes look at Henthorne's 44 Days in Iceland, covering 6500 miles and capturing the artwork he is best known for.  There is a real juxtaposition between this live footage and the finished artwork. This film provides the visual of the chasm between real time and Henthorne's Long Exposures.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iEuGkdG3rvTlAcCWmrgwKUzn9ot.jpg", "actors": ["Jason Henthorne (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
