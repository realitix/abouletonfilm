Nesmith lends his soulful, Western style to solo hits such as \"Joanne,\" \"Silver Moon\" and \"Moon over the Rio Grande.\" Between tunes, he offers plenty of his trademark offbeat humor and repartee with his backup band of long-time collaborators Red Rhodes, John Jorgenson, Joe Chemay, Luis Conte and John Hobbs.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
