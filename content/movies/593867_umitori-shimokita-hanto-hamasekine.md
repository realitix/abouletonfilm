Focusing on the fishermen and their stories, Tsuchimoto and his crew made their subject matter the \u201ctheft of the sea\u201d perpetrated by giant business conglomerates. While the fishermen of Minamata were obvious victims of the mercury\u00ad-poisoning tragedy, the fishermen in Shimokita were inadvertently becoming the permanent victims of another announced trag\u00adedy. Tsuchimoto interviews the fishermen, especially focusing on a stage play actor and his boat\u00ad-owner family, establishing, as it became his practice, a complex reflection about the threat brought to small communities by the forces of \u201cprogress\u201d.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
