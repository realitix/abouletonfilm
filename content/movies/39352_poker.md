At the age of 80, the director launched his latest production, which is also his second comedy in a long row of action and historic films. \"Poker\" is a cinema adaptation of Adrian Lustig's theatre play with the same name, and focuses on four male friends, representatives for the social canvas: a doctor without a moral conscience, an unscrupulous politician, a chief of the local mafia, and a businessman who made a fortune in America. Made by MediaPro Pictures, 'Poker' looks at immorality and intrigues in politics, hinting at the fact that contemporary Romania is a day to day jungle where strings are pulled by those in power, so everything turns into a poker round, where those who have the right aces in their sleeve can win.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A97JKxZ4ALtgINmTK5vWcekga6y.jpg", "actors": ["Vladimir G\u0103itan (Horia)", "Horatiu Malaele (Titel)", "Valentin Teodosiu (Claudiu)", "Ion Ritiu (Marcel)", "Catalina Grama (Monica)", "Vasile Muraru (The Priest)", "Mircea Diaconu (Calabrezu)", "Mihai Bendeac (Catalin)", "George Alexandru (Arcasa)", "Petrica Alexandru (Horia at 12 yo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
