Just as commercials pop up on television screens for 30 seconds and then fade from memory, the imagery used by Murata pixelates and melts into a colorful digital sea. Takeshi Murata produces extraordinary digital works that build upon the experience of animation. His innovative practice and processes range from intricate computer-aided, hand-drawn animations to manipulating the flaws, defects and broken code in digital video technology. He alters appropriated footage from vintage horror films, commercials and movies, and creates fields of color, form and motion, redefining the boundaries between abstraction and recognition.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7xKd3HyerCwhvd78sDgUrjiSLRZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
