Crossings of imaginations, of mythologies: the South, the origins, the search for a \"greecity\", the search for the magical potential of the image, the feminine one as \"force in love\". Crossings of plastic gestures: one on canvas support, the other on photographic and filmic support. We invited the artist to become herself body-painting, filmed painting. We have staged her texts, her paintings, her objects, her space. Attempt to reveal it as an embodiment of its own mythology.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9GKxvctVnuz8gw6buUJuoPJ79Wk.jpg", "actors": ["Lena Vandrey ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
