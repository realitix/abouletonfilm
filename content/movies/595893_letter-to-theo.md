In a tragically ironic consequence of the austerity measures, the ambulance arrived too late to save him. His close collaborator Elodie L\u00e9lu composes this ode to the late artist's life and work. Directly addressing her deceased friend in a poetic letter read in voice-over by actress Ir\u00e8ne Jacob, L\u00e9lu returns to Greece, where she finds a country battered by interminable economic strife and overwhelmed by a constant influx of migrants. Delicately interweaving Angelopoulos's images and words with her own take on contemporary Greece, L\u00e9lu suggests his political vision is now more relevant than ever. This melancholic homage to one of the great directors of our time is also a poignant tribute to his country's passionate fight to preserve its dignity despite everything. - Charlotte Selb", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9wKWnGimFbuL68G1FjkKXrerTsm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
