Park\u2019s films often had a strong female perspective and The Risky Road is no exception. The story of a country girl who comes to the city to work, but falls for a rich man and undeservedly gets a bad reputation, the film was marketed as \u201cthe drama every woman should see\u201d. The surviving fragment, showing the despair of Phillips\u2019s character, is a real cinematic gem that leaves one yearning for more material of the film to be discovered. In 2008, a tinted nitrate fragment, with Swedish intertitles at the opening of the second reel, was deposited at the Archival Film Collections of the Svenska Filminstitutet. From the fragment, a 35mm B&W duplicate negative was made, from which this print was struck using the tinting of the nitrate as color reference.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Dorothy Phillips (Marjorie Helmer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
