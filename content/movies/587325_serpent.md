The serpent embodies the primal chaotic life force in mythic symbology. SERPENT uses natural and electronic imagery to convey this elusive creative force. An outstanding piece of art. Striking, kinetic. Its form, techniques, and texture patterns should be studied by all aspiring young filmmakers. A beautiful combination of pure visual poetry and ideas about man and the world. \u2013 Jurors, American Film Festival.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
