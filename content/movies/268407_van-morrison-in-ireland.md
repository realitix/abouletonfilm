The video also shows footage of the band whilst touring in Ireland and images of Belfast, including Hyndford Street and Cyprus Avenue. Tony Stewart of the NME states \"The band display a range of textures reminiscent of The Caledonia Soul Orchestra, first with the dark resonance of Toni Marcus' violin, then Pat Kyle's bright sharp tenor sax and finally Bobby Tench's prickly electric guitar\".  This concert featured the band with which Morrison recorded his 1978 album Wavelength, augmented by a horn section and violinist.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8Wulo4Yw9VTe7W1IOfD37FMTkuo.jpg", "actors": ["Van Morrison ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
