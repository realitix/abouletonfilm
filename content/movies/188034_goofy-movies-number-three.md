Then comes a \"Wotaphony\" newsreel. The last segment is a spoof of James A. FitzPatrick's Traveltalk series. We see a Pitts Fatrick Travel Squawk titled \"A Visit to Schnozzle Isle.\" Schnozzle Isle is just off the coast of a Polynesian land which, when seen from the air, has a profile that looks remarkably (or perhaps not so remarkably) like 'Jimmy Durante' .", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Pete Smith (Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
