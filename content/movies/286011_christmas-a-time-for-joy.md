The words, melody, and interpretation of this song fills my eyes with tears when I hear it...the disc is worth it for this number alone.  -Alejandra Vernon", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ago2vINN4Kehwa84HrSXK73TPAl.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Gaither (Self)", "Gloria Gaither (Self)", "Mark Lowry (Self)", "David Phelps (Self)", "Vestal Goodman (Self)", "Guy Penrod ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ElJ0fiD0lkc"}
