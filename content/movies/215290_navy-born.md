Despite the resistance of the lad's surviving relatives, who worry that growing in the Navy will be hard on the boy, the officer loves and takes good care of the boy. At least he does until the child is abducted by a gangster who has mistaken him for his long-lost boy. Fortunately for the young fellow, the officer rallies the entire Navy and comes to the rescue.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nVZfHbWicV1nHJ08BtqO088Rvwb.jpg", "actors": ["William Gargan (Lt.
