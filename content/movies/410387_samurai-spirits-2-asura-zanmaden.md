Shiki, though apparently free from Yuga's influence, is recognized as a threat for the sorceress' return and it was through Nakoruru's reasoning that previously saved her life from Haohmaru. Nakoruru finds her and then struggles to peacefully defend her from her pursuers, which include Haohmaru, Galford, and Asura.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pNB7cNmlSTTy7K3DD1sXX7rtKMI.jpg", "actors": ["Daiki Nakamura (Haohmaru)", "Harumi Ikoma (Nakoruru)", "Kaori Minami (Shiki)", "Mantar\u00f4 Koichi (Galford)", "Keiko Kamitani (Rimururu)", "Kong Kuwata (Genjuro)", "Kazuya Ichij\u00f4 (Asura)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [404616], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
