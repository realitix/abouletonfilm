Krill, Brian Allan and James Earnshaw examine the shadowy world of the occult to ask whether it's truly a gate to Satan or merely an ancient spiritual practice that the modern-day masses just don't understand. Along the way, they explore the roots of religion, including ritual magic, shamanism and other spiritual practices that don't always get the attention they deserve.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6QAJ80g6ibwwU1zpBwTOhize130.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
