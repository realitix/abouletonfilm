They share a nice 2BHK apartment in the northern suburbs of Mumbai and are befriended by their elderly neighbor Madhusudan Tanha (Anupam Kher), a struggling poet and lyricist. Tanha is a loner living with his only companion, a Persian cat whom he lovingly calls Shehzadi. Preeti is possessive and has issues with trust. When she mistakenly suspects her boyfriend to be unfaithful, she throws him out of the house but soon realizes she can't afford the payment on the apartment on her own. On the advice of a fellow airhostess, she advertises for a tenant to share her apartment. Enter Neha Bhardwaj (Neetu Chandra), a modest small-town girl asking for accommodation. Very impressed by her simplicity and respectfulness, Preeti believes she has found a perfect roommate. The two girls soon become close - their camaraderie leads them to even become companions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lvucdapV1KaHmEysRLWxBKVZccC.jpg", "actors": ["Neetu Chandra (Neha)", "Tanushree Dutta (Preeti)", "Rohit Roy (Karan)", "Anupam Kher (Tanha)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
