Carlos Sorin takes the format and voices of the ancient news films screened in the cinemas in those years, adding fictional TV news reports, and tells about an imaginary general hysteria in Buenos Aires with people wanting to get the marvellous drug. Though I was born and live in Buenos Aires, I doubted about the film first time I watched it. It seems very believable. Sorin filmed the movie in 1986. Then, Buenos Aires news talked about Dr Vidal and his discovering, \"crotoxina\", a marvellous drug that could avoid the cancer extracted from the poison of snakes. Perhaps Vidal and his snakes inspired Dr Kurz and the \u00f1and\u00fa story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pxHpYF02vDVkCoYgENwLXtpeKpO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "QLofU_e7nYw"}
