The opening scene is at a New Year's party where Pierre disappears, and Mathilde starts remembering their life together in flashbacks that tell the whole story. Mathilde is ever-suffering, and Pierre is on the whole revolting, so why she hung in there for so long is hopefully made clear in these flashbacks.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gyvmuuaDsITTdBLSwPT9hvr6LwG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
