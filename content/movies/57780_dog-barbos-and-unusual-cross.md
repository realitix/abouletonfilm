What's more fun: fishing with worms, or dynamite? Three friends decided to have a blast! Unfortunately their dog Barbos just loves playing fetch. And this time that stick was used for blast fishing. Barbos saw people throwing a smoking stick in a water, and fetched it right back to his owners. The \"unusual cross\" part begins when owners try to outrun the dog with dynamite.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nzxuhvJCsphzWEh2wmhlrBNLvzS.jpg", "actors": ["Georgiy Vitsin (\"Coward\")", "Yuriy Nikulin (\"Dunce\")", "Yevgeni Morgunov (\"Stager\")", "Barbos (\u043f\u0451\u0441 \u0411\u0430\u0440\u0431\u043e\u0441)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [42279, 435041, 92983, 42275], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
