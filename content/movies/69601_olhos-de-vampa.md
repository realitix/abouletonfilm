Dr. Artur, the chief of police, assigns detective Le\u00f4ncio to investigate the murder together with the fetishist photographer Oscar. When other women are found dead in the same modus-operandi - i.e., peach in the mouth, bite in the ass, and no blood - the police gives the nickname of \"Vampa\" to the vampire serial-killer. Without any lead, they decide to follow a sexy and popular night-club dancer on the streets of S\u00e3o Paulo, trying to identify possible suspects.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dCR7bLVfvNHZZqu3A9T3paaEhyk.jpg", "actors": ["Joel Barcellos (Vampa)", "Ant\u00f4nio Abujamra (Dr. Arthur)", "Marco Ricca (Oscar)", "Washington Luiz Gonzales (Le\u00f4ncio)", "Mary Alexandre  ()", "Maura Baiocchi  (Old Woman)", "J\u00falio Calasso ()", "Jos\u00e9 Rubens Chach\u00e1 (Night Club Host)", "Christiane Tricerri (Diva Botelho)", "Vanessa Goulart  ()", "Marcelo Mansfield  ()", "Paula Melissa  ()", "Laert Sarrumor  ()", "Malu Bierrenbach ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
