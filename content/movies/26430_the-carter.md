(Perhaps not surprising after eight months in Riker\u2019s Island.) But if you\u2019re looking for the old Weezy, Adam Bhala Lough\u2019s ride through Wayne\u2019s world, filmed over six fly on the wall months as III broke wide, offers a deep dose \u2013 too deep for Wayne himself, who sued to block the movie after its 2009 Sundance debut. (At this writing it\u2019s still in legal limbo in the States but widely available on DVD elsewhere.)\r\n\r\nRambling and disjointed in a good way \u2013 style here utterly matches subject \u2013 The Carter finds Wayne alternately ensconced in Amsterdam and on the road, pursuing a hazy but remarkably productive creative path that somehow melds constant consumption of pot and \u201cpurple\u201d (cough syrup-spiked soda) with a work ethic that would put most performers to shame: mic and mobile recorder are always to hand to catch the couplets Weezy spills readily off the dome (and invariably plays back \u2013 he never listens to any rap but his own). Immersed in the idiosyncratic internal rhythms of an artist who seems to live fully in the present and entirely according to his own beat, this insinuating doc burns slowly but builds surely, finding bits of revelation in a stonking live \u201cA Milli\u201d; misbegotten interviews with a poor Dutch journalist who has the temerity to bring up poetry and jazz (the movie\u2019s Dont Look Back moment) and another who asks Wayne to envision his own death; or brief, quiet flashes where you suddenly remember there\u2019s a guy called Dwayne Carter Jr. under all the layers of weirdness and weed."}], "recommandations_id": [52452, 31688, 20032, 25204]}
