Derek Yee is Cheng, a brusque construction worker who discovers a magical umbrella on a routine dig. When the umbrella is opened and sprinkled with water, a 200 year-old genie arrives to grant the owner's wishes. As if that weren't enough, this genie happens to look like Cherie Chung! Cheng has been given a virtual ticket to Heaven, but he's more annoyed than grateful, and uses the Genie to perform mostly menial tasks.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wtWmApdDGBoUULG0jkZDbWZ0PfT.jpg", "actors": ["Cherie Chung (Qing, the Genie)", "Derek Yee Tung-Sing (Cheng)", "Stanley Fung (Uncle Fan)", "James Yi Lui (Lin Guo Ren)", "Liu Lai-Ling (Zhu)", "Alan Chan Kwok-Kuen (Ren's asst)", "To Siu-Ming (Ren's asst / Ming)", "Charlie Cho (Rich gambler)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
