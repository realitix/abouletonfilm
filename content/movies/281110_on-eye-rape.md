It is an American sexual education film in which plant and animal sex are explained. I, together with an artist friend, Natsuyuki Nakanishi, punched big holes in almost all of the frames. It was a protest against Japanese censorship of explicit images of sex, particularly pubic hair which the censors would cover with black marks. I inserted a few subliminal frames of pornographic imagery from magazines several times throughout the film. At the end, I even punched holes in these subliminal pictures, thereby 'censoring' the censored image.\" \u2014 Takahiko Iimura", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m8BZA53HirlpJNVzqYb5K6zYAjm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
