In search of a new life, she ventures out to New York City in hopes of following in her mother's footsteps as a musician, although her past doesn't stay back in Texas like she desperately hoped it would. While in New York, she meets Grace Vandeloure, a French chorus girl for Jiano Bianchi's infamous speakeasy club.
