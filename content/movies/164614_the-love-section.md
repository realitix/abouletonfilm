Ali\u2019s best friend Joel (BRIAN HOOKS) and his wife (TANGI MILLER) are happy to see Ali cut off his line of women, while Sandrine\u2019s best friend Steph (TEYANA TAYLOR) is unenthusiastic about Sandrine welcoming a man into her home to meet her son and mother (KELLITA SMITH).  With a declining real estate career and issues with his new relationship, Ali starts questioning just how committed he\u2019s willing to be. One important meeting with real estate mogul James Johnson (MEKHI PHIFER) could change his life for forever.  For the first time it looks like Ali may make a transformation if he can steer clear of obstacles. In the end will love conquer all?
