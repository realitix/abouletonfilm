He believes in the adage of life is short and carpe diem. At New Year's Party 2007, he spies on a girl called Sandhya (Shamili) in a salwar-kameez, writing a diary at the pub. Through a series of searches with his friend \"Fatso\" (Krishnudu), he ends up discovering that Sandhya lives alone at a beach side house and runs a nursery. She is very traditional with her own ideals. He enters in her house on a pretense as a Paying Guest to make her fall in love with him. After a series of attempts to woo Sandhya, Uday eventually succeeds and presents her with 12 gifts on her birthday, the last being Uday himself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2Ke8vhxcZTsxFE0wXltX5G9n2wu.jpg", "actors": ["Siddharth (Uday)", "Shamili (Sandhya)", "Sunil Varma (Abhishek)", "Ali (Al)", "Saptagiri ()", "Krishnudu ()", "Surekha Vani ()", "Pradeep Ram Singh Rawat ()", "Tanikella Bharani ()", "M.
