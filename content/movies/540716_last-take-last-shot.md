Both share the same dream: to direct their own films someday. Their lives as mere \"small production people\" took a different turn when, together with the people in the unit van they were riding,had an encounter with armed men. Their co-workers were killed, and the two of them were forced to drive the unit van out of fear until it ran out of gas. The van contains equipment for movie production like cameras, lights and film stocks. They ended up in a secluded barrio not yet reached by modern technology, and therefore, the townsfolk knew nothing of the movie industry.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qnSBBsnIkzRlqSUo2eHeLwuhJlX.jpg", "actors": ["Jeffrey Quizon ()", "Dwight Gaston ()", "Boboy Garovillo ()", "Danny Javier ()", "Jim Paredes ()", "Joel Torre ()", "Ronnie Lazaro ()", "Roence Santos ()", "Soliman Cruz  ()", "Shamaine Buencamino ()", "Raul Morit ()", "Bombi Plata ()", "Jose F.
