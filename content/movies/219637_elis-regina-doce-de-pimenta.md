The first sight would rapidly disappear and anyone who would get closer would also be surprised. It is not known if she did it for \"beauty or precision\", as Guimar\u00e3es Rosa used to say. But the truth is that stereotypes would be destroyed as soon as she would fetch her followers. And revelations would unfold. Behind her suavely acute and toned voice, there was a deep tone that only few could reach. Behind her humble upbringing, there was an uncommon sensibility and intelligence. Her disguise was her irrepressible technique. Elis was pure emotion. And singing was not her final objective, she really wanted to make people happy. This film honours Elis and creates a singular portrait of Brazil's biggest star.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/psKahUUskcjLPp84jDZP6BMrVuf.jpg", "actors": ["Elis Regina (Herself)", "Adoniran Barbosa (Himself)", "C\u00e9sar Camargo Mariano (Himself)", "Jo\u00e3o Bosco (Himself)", "Rita Lee (Herself)", "Roberto de Carvalho (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
