But the body grabs me, it slows me, it enslaves me.\u201d  -- Ponce de L\u00e9on  Our PONCE DE LE\u00d3N discovered the fountain of youth and drank of immortality in the waning moments of his life. In an instant, he became old forever \u2013 an 80-year old Spaniard who would continue to walk the earth for century after century after century, watching as coral foundations gave way to mangrove swamps, as swamps were drained and buildings were erected, as buildings decayed and swamps returned. Our PONCE DE LE\u00d3N is an immortal for whom time poses the greatest dilemma \u2013 it is a constant, a given, and his personal battle lies in trying to either arrest time entirely or to make the hands on his clock move ever faster. For Ponce de L\u00e9on, time is a problem of body, and only by escaping his container can he escape time itself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3HQQPhMGORNeFKLDapwvU0pza4Z.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
