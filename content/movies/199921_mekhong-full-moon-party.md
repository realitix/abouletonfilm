After sunset, mysterious fireballs rise up from the river and disappear into the sky. Where do the fireballs come from? While the locals still adhere to the traditional myth that they are the dragon, Great Naga, making a sacred offering to Buddha, the Western visitors take a more sceptical stance: Dr. Norati sets out to prove that the fireballs are natural while Dr. Surapol wants to prove the phenomenon a hoax. Meanwhile, temple-custodian Abbot Loh believes his monks have been responsible for the \"miracle\" for the past 30 years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/haOAmrQoL7XDfUlHyoijw96u759.jpg", "actors": ["Thidarat Chareonchaichana (Teacher Alice)", "Noppadol Duangporn (Luang Por Loh)", "Boonchai Limathibul (Dr. Norati)", "Jonathan Morrill (Phelong)", "Surasee Patham (Headmaster)", "Somlek Sakdikul (Dr. Surapol)", "Anuchit Sapanpong (Khan)", "Boonsri Yindee (Aunt Oong)", "Boonsong Nakphoo ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
