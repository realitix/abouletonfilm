The film opens in 1877 with the brothers trying to settle down after 15 years of thievery. Frank is shown to be a book-loving and family-oriented man, while brother Jesse is a money-hungry womanizer. The movie follows their lives through Jesse's death at the hands of the \"rotten little coward\" Bob Ford and Frank's death in 1892.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8SfAEAJlWcR970VKxNSpD3XrW0s.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Cash (Frank James)", "Kris Kristofferson (Jesse James)", "Marcia Cross (Sarah Hite)", "Gail Youngs (Anna)", "David Allan Coe (Whiskeyhead)", "Andy Stahl (Liddil)", "June Carter Cash (Mother James)", "Ed Bruce (Major Edwards)", "Darrell Wilkins (Bob Ford)", "Meg Gibson (Zee)", "Cherie Elledge-Grapes (Martha Bolton)", "Earl Poole Ball (Squire Earthman)", "Jack Barlow (Uncle George Hite)", "Willie Nelson (Gen.
