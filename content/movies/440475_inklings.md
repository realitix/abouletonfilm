As the animator goes about his drawings, a narrator tells some stories about the historical figure in question. The drawings come to life as the narrator tells some anecdotes about the historical figure. As each drawing nears its completion and as the story about that figure nears its end, it becomes more and more apparent who the historical figure in question is.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tDJZ4U0bx0yFJooQVi4w8OWCW8N.jpg", "actors": ["Lowell Thomas (Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
