Coppola, along with editor/longtime collaborator Walter Murch, added 49 minutes of material that had been removed from the original film. It represents a significant re-edit of the original version. (I've added this before but it was removed, I figure if the Richard Donner Cut is on here why can't Redux, so please don't remove it)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tlWg6RUtkwjdhdNfF5ylMbNwTfB.jpg", "actors": ["Martin Sheen (Captain Benjamin L.
