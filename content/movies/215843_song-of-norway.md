It stars Toralv Maurstad as Grieg and features an international cast including Florence Henderson, Christina Schollin, Robert Morley, Harry Secombe, Oskar Homolka, Edward G. Robinson and Frank Porretta (as Rikard Nordraak). Filmed in Super Panavision 70 by Davis Boulton and presented in single-camera Cinerama in some countries, it was an attempt to capitalise on the success of The Sound of Music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qiFkn5QuVtnD8lMs844y0NgXBfp.jpg", "actors": ["Toralv Maurstad (Edvard Grieg)", "Florence Henderson (Nina Hagerup)", "Christina Schollin (Therese Berg)", "Frank Porretta (Richard Nordraak)", "Harry Secombe (Bioernstjerne Bjoernson)", "Robert Morley (Berg)", "Edward G.
