This is a story that shows how seven bars and two thousand US dollars bring together an interesting mix of characters: an opportunistic manager, a materialistic courtesan, a con artist posing as a commissioner of the Treasury, a white-collar worker who will do anything for a promotion, a man who specialises in conning women, a father who marries off his daughter for money and a sorcerer who fakes his magic. In this dog-eat-dog world, the only truth is that everyone is lying for his own gain. Playing the courtesan who longs to be part of high society, Li Lihua steals the film with a feisty performance opposite the amusing Yan Jun, whose con artist character has a tendency to flirt with lyrics from Peking operas.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Li Li-Hua (Su Man Na)", "Han Fei (Chang Geng Liang)", "Yen Chun (Pan Chung Fu)", "Hsi-Yu Li (Manager Chao)", "Na Lin (Mrs. Wu)", "Lien Liu (Mrs. Ho)", "Fan Ping (Hsiao Li)", "Chin Su (Sai Shen Hsin)", "Jing-Lu Sun (Wu Yu Ling)", "Yin Szema (Socialite)", "Wang Yuan-Long (Ho Chi Hsin)", "Hsiao Yen (Wu Hsin Yuan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
