Their mother left for Yeonbyeon three months ago, promising to return with their father, and they have heard no news from her since. Every day, Myung-hee and Myung-ho go to the shipping port or airport hoping for their parents' return. Tired from waiting one day, Myung-hee meets Yong-kyu, a young man high from sniffing glue. Beyond a tough and violent exterior, Myung-hee finds a young man's heartwarming inner-self, and she expects Yong-kyu to take the place of her parents. But even Yong-kyu leaves her and life steadily deteriorates. Hoping for help, Myung-hee goes to a familiar Korean-Chinese woman, arriving in time to find immigration officials taking the woman away. They are now truly alone.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pgQK2fwUWgVsuG9HdgiuACRUuwr.jpg", "actors": ["Joo Da-young (Myung-hee)", "Lee Ju-seung (Yong-kyu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
