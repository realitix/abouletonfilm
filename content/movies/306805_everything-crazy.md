She and hubby Gustav exchanged their passionate relationship for a permanent seize-fire. The once uninhibited and vibrant journalist is now just a few fading photographs on the wall. And then, her world is shattered when Gustav apparently starts an affair with the very big investor who just might be the savior of his company \u2013 Elzaan Mostert.  Enter Helena\u2019s alter ego, the can-do, let\u2019s-make-a-plan, nothing-is-impossible younger version of herself. Alter Ego comes up with the idea of starting a blog called Alles wat Mal is (Everything Crazy), documenting Helena\u2019s hectic life, and her quest to win back Gustav\u2019s affection, and put a spark back into her marriage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nuruVPE84qIM2jbMKZD2y8Yvoue.jpg", "actors": ["Louw Venter (Gustav Joubert)", "Erica Wessels (Helena Joubert / Alter Ego)", "Meme Ditshego (Miriam)", "Christina Storm (Elzaan Mostert)", "Jacques Bessenger (Pieter Britz / Prof Hathoorn)", "Eugene du Toit (Pierre)", "Keagan Verwey (Gustav Jnr.)", "Chris de Clerq (Hermann)", "Elzette Maarschalk (Catherine)", "Jana Strydom (Esme Steyn)", "Deon Coetzee (Jan)", "Richard van der Westhuizen (Andre Joubert)", "Philicity Reeken (Lerato)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "VuvSI4aneW0"}
