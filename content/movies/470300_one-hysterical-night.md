Since all the other inmates/attendees think they are historical figures such as Robin Hood, the Duke of Wellington, Paul Revere, William Tell, Salome, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes and others, it takes a while for Judd to separate the wheat from the chaff and prove he is not deranged. His quest becomes more urgent when he falls in love with a nurse named Josephine, who does not think she is Napoleon's \"Josephine\" but is convinced Judd thinks he is Napoleaon.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Reginald Denny (William 'Napoleon' Judd)", "Nora Lane (Nurse Josephine)", "E.J.
