During a dramatic journey to a hospital in Owerri, Nigeria, he lost all life signs and was later pronounced dead by two different medical staff in two different hospitals. The latter wrote a Medical report and commissioned the corpse to the mortuary. But Daniel's wife remembered a verse in Scripture from Hebrews 11: \"Women received their dead raised to life again.\" She heard about a meeting where Evangelist Reinhard Bonnke was going to preach, and proceeded to bring Daniel's body in his coffin. What follows is a story you will never forget", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hiipA12RwfQEsJSbHvaEFklBUKT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
