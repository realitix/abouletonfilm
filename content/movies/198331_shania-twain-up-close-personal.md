This setting is even more intimate than the all-around arena she had during her Up! world tour. This special features songs from Up! Come On Over and The Woman In Me. But most of all, she performs with **Alisson Krauss** and **Union Station** on this special! I got to see it on NBC and absolutely loved it! It gave it a home-feel sound to the songs. Very country-ish if you will. This is a must for all SHANIA fans! here and all over! The best thing about this performance is she does her own rendition of AC/DC's classic \"You Shook Me All Night Long\" with some of the lyrics redone. LUV IT TO PIECES! \r\n\r\n> By J.
