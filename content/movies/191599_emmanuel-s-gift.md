Of the twenty million people in Ghana, two million are disabled. This is the story of one disabled man whose mission-and purpose- is to change all that forever. In Emmanuel's Gift, filmmakers Lisa Lax and Nancy Stern have uncovered a story as compelling as it is important. Narrated by Oprah Winfrey, the film chronicles the life of Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah, a young Ghanaian man born with a severely deformed right leg, who today, against incalculable odds, is opening minds, hearts and doors-and effecting social and political change throughout his country.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kaE415vEFEtC1otWcprkUKf4QGS.jpg", "actors": ["Oprah Winfrey (Narrator)", "Robin Williams (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "gB0BD5l8Ojc"}
