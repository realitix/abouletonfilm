It is a time of hatred in South Korea. LGBTQ people are the easy targets for hatred. In searching for what makes a marginalized life livable, I embark upon a journey. I encounter a double life of Lee Muk, a 70-year-old Korean \u201cMr. Pants\u201d and precarious lives of a Japanese lesbian couple, Ten and Non, after 3/11. As an ever-growing number of citizens are becoming the targets of 'witch-hunting' in Korea, true faces of the haters slowly begin to unfold.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tigj77wrSzyFjw9PbDUmg5o17yb.jpg", "actors": ["\uc774\ubb35 (\uc774\ubb35)", "\uc774\uc601 (\uc774\uc601)", "\ub17c (\ub17c)", "\ud150 (\ud150)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
