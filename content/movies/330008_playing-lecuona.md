Serving as guides through Lecuona\u2019s music are three of the most gifted Latin jazz pianists in the world: Chucho Vald\u00e9s, Michel Camilo, and Gonzalo Rubalcaba. Vald\u00e9s fuses Latin jazz together with Afro-Cuban rhythms in Lecuona\u2019s native Havana; Camilo recreates elegant aural soundscapes in New York and the Canary Islands; and Rubalcaba fuses jazz and flamenco in Seville, the heart of Andalusian Spain. Together, these three musicians provide a rich portrait of Lecuona\u2019s music and its lasting influence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1zSGThsDfCwu2VINbgJhKC4BOQk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "EA03oQnQ6IE"}
