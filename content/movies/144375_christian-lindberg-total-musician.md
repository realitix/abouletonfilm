My personal favorite is the segment on writing Chick'aBone Checkout as a world premier performed by Charles \"Charlie\" Vernon of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. You get to watch Charlie and Christian exchanging ideas to put in the piece, debating the performance details, and in general, bringing humanity into the musical equation. It is extraordinary that Christian and Charlie allowed the cameras to film this development over many months."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
