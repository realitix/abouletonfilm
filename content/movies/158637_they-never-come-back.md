From there, Nolan's path leads downhill. He is drawn into a romance with a nightclub entertainer, then is framed on a theft charge by a jealous suitor. After his prison term, Nolan makes a spectacular comeback in a fight which proves his courage and integrity, while disproving the fallacy about the old sports adage that \"they never come back.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fzFvMGlgvUA9gIz1ie0IP9ecudK.jpg", "actors": ["Regis Toomey (Jimmy Nolan)", "Dorothy Sebastian (Adele Landon)", "Edward Woods (Ralph Landon)", "Greta Granstedt (Mary Nolan)", "Earle Foxe (Jerry Filmore)", "Gertrude Astor (Kate)", "James J.
