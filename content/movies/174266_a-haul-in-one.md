(Maybe it's because Popeye isn't squinting here.) Anyhow, Olive has made the mistake of hiring them. She hasn't finished packing yet, so the boys, smitten as soon as she answers the door, compete to help her. Once packed, they compete to move more impressive piles of her belongings. Popeye easily wins these contests, even though Bluto locks him in the van at one point. At the end, Bluto socks Popeye into the piano, then into a table; though he hardly seems to need it, Popeye still eats his spinach, then thrashes Bluto.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vPy8wYnbYO0TbZHfz20A8rLhjhf.jpg", "actors": ["Jackson Beck (Bluto (voice) (uncredited))", "Jack Mercer (Popeye (voice) (uncredited))", "Mae Questel (Olive Oyl (voice) (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
