For the Naruse-familiar, it is an anomaly only in its placement within his filmography\u2014indeed, this could be a film made by the elder, stasis-minded Naruse momentarily inhabiting, through a metaphysical twist of fate, his stylistically exuberant younger self. Set in depression-era Japan around the time of the Sino-Japanese War (which the director evokes, during a brief dream sequence, by dissolving between children's war games and actual adult warfare), The Whole Family Works gently observes a family coming apart at the seams. Ishimura (Musei Tokugawa) is the jobless father of nine children.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2PtGxVM8GvycNbhXXAdJQ6VZYcw.jpg", "actors": ["Musei Tokugawa (Ishimura)", "Noriko Honma (Ishimura's wife)", "Akira Ubukata (Kiichi, first son)", "Kaoru It\u00f4 (Genji, second son)", "Seikichi Minami (Noboru, third son)", "Takeshi Hirata (Eisaku, fourth son)", "Seiichiro Bando (Kokichi, fifth son)", "Kiyoko Wakaba (Hide, first daughter)", "Den Obinata (Ogawa - the teacher)", "Sumie Tsubaki (Mitsuko)", "Jun Maki (Kiichi's goroup leader)", "Kinji Fujiwa (Ishimura's fellow worker)", "Susumu Fujita (Genji's fellow worker)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
