This film tells the story of the 'Spitsbergen Retraced' expedition, as the team spends 32 days crossing the icecap measuring how the landscape has changed over almost a century - as well as making some surprising discoveries about the original explorers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6rtcyCpZi0AF5EzApYerKB710tw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
