He is unmotivated at the office, and unable to break off a lukewarm relationship with his girlfriend. Then, he meets an old classmate from high school, Ryoichi ([Hiroyuki Ikeuchi]]). Ryoichi says he's starting up a clothing brand with a group of friends. One day, Kenji visits their atelier, or workplace, and is fascinated by the sense of freedom that they share. As his relationship with them deepens, Kenji finds it harder and harder to accept the old world he comes from. One day, he punches his boss and quits his job. Now a proper member of Ryoichi's team, it's the start of a new and carefree life for him. However, it is short-lived. The clothes they make do not sell as well as they hoped for. Short on cash, energy, and ideas, the negative feedback loop forces each of them to start struggling in a search for alternative paths.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8vFQ60ThshWghDMXUUrWMpRGjqk.jpg", "actors": ["Kenji Mizuhashi (Katsuo)", "Ry\u014d (Megumi Tsubaki)", "Hiroyuki Ikeuchi (Ryoichi Nakamura)", "Ryo Kase (Kenji Hamada)", "Urara Awata (Yumiko)", "K\u00f4z\u00f4 Sat\u00f4 ()", "Kanji Tsuda ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
