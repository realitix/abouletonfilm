Rather by coincidence he came to Berlin in the early 1960s and became part of the new German wave. Schmid worked with, among others, Wenders and Fassbinder, for example as an actor in Wender\u2019s The American Friend. He met Ingrid Caven, who was to play a diva in several of his films. This is a documentation of a part of modern European film history and a good analysis of artistry and how it corresponds to the individual behind the camera. A wealth of archival footage brings us close to many directors and actors in Schmid\u2019s circle. If you\u2019ve never seen a Daniel Schmid film, you are sure to want to after watching this portrait of his life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l2Id0YuZhyOBxGWq95sZzGY9TPk.jpg", "actors": ["Daniel Schmid (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
