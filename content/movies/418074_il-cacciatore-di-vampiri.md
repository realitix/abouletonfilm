In despair and with just a dollar to his account, Siu-ho decides to end it by going into the 2442 room of a residential complex that is said to be haunted. Before reaching his goal, Siu-ho is interrupted by others \"occupiers\" of the building, including a Taoist master exorcist, a housewife traumatized by a tragic past and seemingly good an elderly woman who has an empty coffin conspicuously hanging from the center of his apartment. Siu-ho will soon find that the people and the situation around him are far from normal. Although we do not believe, Siu-ho will soon be pushed into the battle of his life when a group of vicious vampires begin to rise again from the dead.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sJWuOF5Tt6Ax8jUd7tFAF0mTnHj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "-ubNDTOYRhw"}
