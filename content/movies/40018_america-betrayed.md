The movie is unsparing in its treatment of the Corps, and Carde clearly views it as her own personal mission to hold that organization accountable for the many acts of criminal malfeasance it has engaged in over the years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zipr8KOVNlLW5ocxwWFBKWeTyvE.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Dreyfuss (Narrator)", "Robert Bea (Himself)", "Joey DiFatta (Himself)", "Steve Ellis (Himself)", "Lucille Franz (Herself)", "Cynthia Hedge-Morrell (Herself)", "Judy Hoffmeister (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
