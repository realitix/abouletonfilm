But the mainstream media hardly reflects this. Nero\u00b4s Guests is a story about India\u2019s agrarian crisis and the growing inequality seen through the work of the Rural Affairs Editor of Hindu newspaper, P Sainath. Through sustained coverage of the farm crisis, Sainath and his colleagues created the national agenda, compelling a government in denial to take notice and act. Through his writings and lectures, Sainath makes us confront the India we don\u2019t want to see, and provokes us to think about who \u2018Nero\u2019s Guests\u2019 are in today\u2019s world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h8FHfsUdxpbr5oZZ944f1tN2uQy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
