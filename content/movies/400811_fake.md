However, just prior to the 2014 Winter Olympics, where Samuragochi's \"Sonatina for Violin\" was to accompany figure skater Daisuke Takahashi, part-time university lecturer Takashi Niigaki revealed that he had served as the composer's ghostwriter for 18 years, that Samuragochi couldn't notate music and, in fact, could hear perfectly. As Samuragochi's recordings were pulled and performances cancelled, Niigaki enjoyed success on TV talk shows. Filmmaker Tatsuya Mori finds Samuragochi in his small Yokohama apartment with his wife and cat, ready to tell his side of the story. A mesmerizing character study skewering media duplicity and constructions of ability/disability, in which Samuragochi's career has collapsed, taking fact and fiction with it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fJ52mhRuUuqhzGunEdmpabCVr40.jpg", "actors": ["Mamoru Samuragochi ()", "Tatsuya Mori ()", "Takashi Niigaki ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
