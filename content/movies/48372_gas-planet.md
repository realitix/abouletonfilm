Their behavior is definitely alien, but also comically familiar to an earthling audience. Gas Planet is an in-house release from ANTZ co-director Eric Darnell with support from PDI's Character Animation Group. The look of Gas Planet reflects the organic qualities of hand drawn imagery while maintaining the 3D advantages offered by computer animation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kYHGPKVnKDIx3eyULoZYOWzpUCx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
