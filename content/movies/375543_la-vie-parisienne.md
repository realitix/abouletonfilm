{"tmdb_id": 375543, "title": "La Vie Parisienne", "original_title": "La Vie Parisienne", "slug_title": "la-vie-parisienne", "date": "1991-12-01", "genre": ["Musique"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "This 1991 production by the Lyon National Opera presents a welcome opportunity to revel in a uniquely Gallic confection rarely seen outside France. It's also a chance to enjoy one of Offenbach's most inventive, melodic scores in which the starring musical role and many of the best tunes go to the orchestra, here conducted by Jean-Yves Ossonce. This is no accident: the operetta was originally created for a company of actors who relied on pastiche and the composer's help to get them through their \"numbers\". Not so these singers, of course. As Metella, the languorous courtesan who is responsible for the unravelling debacle, Helene Delavault is in meltingly good voice for her show-stopping rondeau, \"A minuit sonnant commence la fete\". Her sparring suitors Gardefeu (Jean-Francois Sivadier) and, particularly, Bobinet (Jacques Verzier) combine marvellous visual comedy with fluid singing and there is some dazzling vocal work from the supporting cast. It's a long piece, but hugely enjoyable.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A77qX2KF7MryFapMnOfwITr6uRw.jpg", "actors": ["H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Delavault (M\u00e9tella)", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Sivadier (Raoul de Gardefeu)", "Jacques Verzier (Bobinet)", "Jean-Yves Chatelais (Baron de Gondremarck)", "Claire Wauthion (Baronne de Gondremarck)", "Isabelle Mazin (Gabrielle)", "Pierre Berriau (Prosper)", "Caroline Chaniolleau (Leonie)", "Alain Hocine (Frick)", "Nathalie Joly (Pauline)", "Ivan Merat-Barboff (Gontran)", "Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Pistorio (Le br\u00e9silien)", "Jean-Yves Ossonce (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
