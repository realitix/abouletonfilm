Antony Simon (Mammootty) is a crime branch CI , but prefers to spend his time fooling around with his son Aadi (Dhananjay). And being a Crime Branch police officer, his rather laid-back attitude is not appreciated by his peers and superiors. Richa Pallod portrays his wife who finds this irritating. The father-son duo becomes friends with the famous national cricketer Sreekanth (Govind Padmasurya) when they save him from some street fight. Once while the father-son duo was out for shopping, Adhi saw a man with the gun and screams at his father. Simon turns back and shoots him but he kills the wrong person. Simon now faces murder charges and is suspended from duty.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rQsiARRdHEVPs9SGUEKbXqxE978.jpg", "actors": ["Mammootty (CI Antony Simon)", "Dhananjay (Adi Simon)", "Richa Pallod (Annie Simon)", "Biju Menon (Roy)", "Radhika (Annie's sister)", "Govind Padmasoorya (Sreekant)", "Daniel Balaji (Shiva)", "Vijayaraghavan ()", "Saikumar ()", "Suraj Venjaramoodu ()", "Babu Swamy (Annie's father)", "Rajan P Dev (Roy's father)", "Vinayakan ()", "Ashish Vidhyarthi (Bheem Bhai)", "Bipin Chandran (News reader)", "Ambika Mohan (Annie's mother)", "Lena (Adi's teacher)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [202719, 240245, 237735, 523951], "youtube_key": "pbwmvcuCKLc"}
