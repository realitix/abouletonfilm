Kaufman has planned the ultimate marathon of lost film prints to unleash upon his faithful cinephile patrons. Four films so rare that they have never been exhibited publicly on American soil until this very night! With titles like Wadzilla, Deathecation, The Diary of Anne Frankenstein, and Zom-B-Movie, Chillerama not only celebrates the golden age of drive-in B horror shlock but also spans over four decades of cinema with something for every bad taste.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kgKNXQwyk1582tBAcVDuvMmoOO2.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Riehle (Cecil Kauman)", "Adam Rifkin (Miles Munson)", "Ray Wise (Dr. Weems)", "Sarah Mutch (Louise)", "Owen Benjamin (Larry)", "Joel David Moore (Adolf Hitler)", "Kristina Klebe (Eva Braun)", "Eric Roberts (General)", "Brent Corrigan (Ricky)", "Tim Sullivan (Coach Tuffman / Gravedigger)", "Kane Hodder (Meshugannah)", "Florian Klein (Nazi Rupert)", "Brendan McCreary (Ryan)", "AJ Bowen (Rick Marshall)", "Lin Shaye (Baglady / Nurse Maleva)", "Anton Troy (Talon)", "Gabby West (Peggy Lou)", "Laura Ortiz (Margot Frank)", "Matthew Temple (Nazi Franz)", "Corey Jones (Fernando Phagabeefy)", "Joe Lynch (Mayna)", "Adam Green (Himself)", "Adam Robitel (Butch)", "Ron Jeremy (Captain Fatso / Playbear)", "Mike Mendez (Drive in Patron / Xombie)", "Tania Raymonde (Zelda)", "Miles Dougal (Hobo / Floyd)", "Ward Roberts (Miller)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [29833, 29611, 72648, 140468], "youtube_key": "pGUCX53u90I"}
