{"tmdb_id": 500829, "title": "Jungle Stampede", "original_title": "Jungle Stampede", "slug_title": "jungle-stampede", "date": "1950-07-28", "genre": ["Action / Aventure"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "While most of the footage is indeed authentic and the safari journey and the reason is real, this is far from being qualified as a documentary since it is filled with stock-footage and staged-incidents to add to the film moments of suspense and/or peril that were not part of the actual expedition, i.e., the camera shows a wild beast stalking the safari with the narrator explaining that the man is unaware that he is being stalked until the animal jumps and kills him. Obvious question would be why didn't the cameraman warn him? The film tells the story of two explorers, George Breakston and Yorke Coplen, setting out to make a photographic record of animal life, and the lives of the tribes they encounter along the way. It is broken up into three segments---the journey from Nairobi to the Land of the Pgymies; the trip from there to the territory of the Masai tribe; and the Masai tribe itself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/io99xFmh9T12U4L4ZftSId0Arbr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
