He'd hoped that I Want You would be 1951's \"answer\" to that post-WW II classic, and while the later film falls short of that goal, it still has much to recommend it. The scene is a small town in the Eastern United States, where the outbreak of hostilities in Korea has a profound effect on several people. WW II veteran Martin Greer (Dana Andrews) wants to re-enlist, much to the dismay of his wife Nancy (Dorothy McGuire).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nj7w14da6XaZKWmRWkbBRoqPV4e.jpg", "actors": ["Dana Andrews (Martin Greer)", "Dorothy McGuire (Nancy Greer)", "Farley Granger (Jack Greer)", "Peggy Dow (Carrie Turner)", "Robert Keith (Thomas Greer)", "Mildred Dunnock (Sarah Greer)", "Ray Collins (Judge Turner)", "Marjorie Crossland (Mrs. Turner)", "Martin Milner (George Kress Jr.)", "Walter Baldwin (George Kress Sr.)", "Jim Backus (Harvey Landrum)", "Walter Sande (Ned Iverson)", "Peggy Maley (Gladys)", "Jerrilyn Flannery (Anne Greer)", "Erik Nielsen (Tony Greer)", "Ann Robinson (Gloria (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
