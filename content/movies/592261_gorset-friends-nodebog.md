The melodies are found in hand-written music books containing both international \"hits\" well known throughout Europe and local favourites - Halling dances and Pols dances are featured alongside minuets, marches and English country dances. These rediscovered treasures from the past can only be recreated through living performance today, here by flautist Hans Olav Gorset and his fellow musicians. These melodies may not seem important to the music historian, but to the listener they certainly are - being international \"hits\" of yesterday - and, who knows, perhaps becoming the hits of today!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1tPYblo9EivLj3gIZVLT6etGcvU.jpg", "actors": ["Hans Olav Gorset (recorders and baroque flutes)", "Cathrine Bothner-By (soprano)", "Elizabeth Gaver (baroque violin)", "Vegard Lund (baroque guitar and theorbo)", "Lars Henrik Johansen (harpsichord)", "Andr\u00e9 Lislevand (viola da gamba)", "Kjell Tore Innervik (Norwegian folk drum)", "H\u00e5kon M\u00f8rch Stene (percussion)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
