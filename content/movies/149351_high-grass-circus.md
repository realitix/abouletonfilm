Filmed in 1976, directors Tony Ianzelo and Torben Schioler followed the Royal Brothers' Circus as they set up their tents and put on their show. Fascinating to watch, the film captures the 24-hour-a-day brand of magic that the circus evokes while revealing the nature of the people who run it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gBn3AscyXC8KB8aANxDyexvck26.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
