The segregation of the Jewish population into the ghetto, and the subsequent horrors of the occupation are vividly chronicled through newsreels and photographs. The narration is taken almost entirely from journals and diaries of those who lived--and died--through the course of the occupation, with the number of different narrators diminishing over the course of the film, symbolic of the death of each narrator.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yi21TFdAZY5uWwsOHmGbGg4m3Py.jpg", "actors": ["Jerzy Kosinski (Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
