No actual footage was shot for the project, which instead consists entirely of outtakes, commercials, strips of undeveloped film, Academy leader, and other filmic castoff material, creating a seemingly endless stream of newsreel and stock footage. It was the longest film ever made at the time of its release, but has since been superseded by many other films.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f4rsLuhFdUTOuJegtngkSR5WWiW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
