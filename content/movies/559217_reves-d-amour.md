She leaves her children and elderly husband to go into exile with Liszt. For a while---long enough to father three children out of wedlock---the composer is content but desires to get back into the limelight. He leaves their home for a month of concert bookings and never returns, leaving the Countess holding the bag...and three kids. The Paris Conservatory Orchestra plays brief bits of Lizst, Chopin and Shumann and the piano renditions are credited to Nikita Magaloff. Mila Parely, daintly smoking cigars, appears briefly as George Sand, confidante of the two lovers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/47MplLrdx4dPrIeWLqaHzoDAcEk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
