The predictable and unpredictable, the calculated race of the star and the incalculable (or almost) clouds, the routine and the event, the story and the anecdote - all punctuated by 7 visions. Filmed from a constant geolocated point, to an open window overlooking a French city where a canal and a few planes pass. It's also a family film that would make the reamake of Rear Window:take the measure of the small world, exterior and interior where we live, measure, to take a small place, its place, tell stories, have visions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ps7f7TxWxTn6Ozu3tyyRgArilm5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
