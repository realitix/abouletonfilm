The bearded proprietor explains the equipment and gives them a demonstration: he starts machines whirring, and projects a painting of three women onto a large screen; suddenly the women begin to move. The customers are impressed. First the women sits in the special seat: she's projected onto the screen, and her good nature comes out in the laughing image. Then it's the man's turn, but the machine discloses a vastly different nature in him. Will his reaction threaten our proprietor's inventions?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qOfe6sNnOJGROXsbb5IzuwEudfg.jpg", "actors": ["Fernande Albany ()", "Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [119974, 49272, 44327, 188069], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
