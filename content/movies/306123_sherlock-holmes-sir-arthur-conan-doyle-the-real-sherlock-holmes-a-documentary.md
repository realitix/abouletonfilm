From his first appearance in 1887 in the \"Strand Magazine\", Sherlock Holmes and his constant companion Dr. Watson delighted every reader who came into contact with them, and when Conan Doyle, tiring of his masterly creation, killed him off in 1893, there was such a public outcry that he was forced to devise a complex story line to bring him back to life.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
