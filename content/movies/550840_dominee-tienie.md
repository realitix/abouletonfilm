Do clergymen, or even the church, still have a role to play in this world? He is trying his best to adapt and make sense of the changes, but, in the process, he is alienating his wife and children. After an incident with a dying vagrant, Tienie finds himself at a crossroads. Will he be able to regain his self-confidence and win back the love of his family and will he be brave enough to provide guidance to his congregation in this new era? Based on the play by Dana Snyman.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sakwHl4riIwQ3OCxF6dr5GFsXdy.jpg", "actors": ["Frank Opperman ()", "Henri\u00ebtta Gryffenberg ()", "Thapelo Mokoena ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "285264091"}
