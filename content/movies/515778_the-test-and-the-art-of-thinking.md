In so doing, it strives to support individuals who are embarking on the road to college, by examining what the SAT/ACT measures and means, and asking a range of educational leaders, admissions professionals and stakeholders in the test\u2014from tutors to parents to test designers\u2014to grapple with the test\u2019s use, ramifications and future.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bJ8SKI8I0aBCTDVic4suY0rI1nD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
