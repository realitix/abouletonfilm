This early 1980\u2019s documentary features Garner talking about his life and influences, and comes loaded with narrated excerpts from his books and eerie musical interludes and recorded screams that are curiously reminiscent of The League Of Gentlemen. Other scenes of Garner wandering around his key sites of inspiration \u2013 mainly around Alderley Edge in Cheshire \u2013 look like they\u2019re from the early days of pop videos, with shaky hand-held footage and sudden zooms into blacked-out windows and strange rock formations. Somehow it all adds to the sincere intention of introducing Garner\u2019s unusual body of work to the unsuspecting viewer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lDMXVrxhQDOaYL2G3AcH67UBHJh.jpg", "actors": ["Alan Garner ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "6D6_kO_4WqM"}
