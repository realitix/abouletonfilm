In Kaliyugaya the young couple have aged, their children are scattered, and their past is recalled in flashbacks from the former movie. Since the kali yuga is the worst of four Hindu time periods and we are in it now, the title implies that suffering is bound to arise in the 83-minutes of the movie. Although unhappiness is not a principal theme, the mother (Punya Hendenlya) does grapple with her feelings when she gets a letter from her son in London that accuses her and her husband (Henry Jayasena) of serious faults -- and she starts to go back over the past, recalling incidents that might help her to understand why her son has turned against them.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
