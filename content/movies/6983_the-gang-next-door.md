All of them plunder their parents' supplies in order to build their own stage and amplifiers. Baffled by these unexplained thefts, the parents decide to hold a meeting as their suspicions turn to a group of camper folks living across from their flat. The tables are turned when the residents take a camping holiday of their own and end up being mistrusted by the locals as much as they themselves did their own neighbors. Meanwhile, the children's gang meets a rival group of kids who are planning to enter the same competition.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/torzyhBq9j6FuGJ4XBlcNb7cD4K.jpg", "actors": ["Harro Coppens (Erik Verginkel)", "Patrick van Doorn (Bennie)", "Liesbeth Hovius (Reene Klein)", "Ingrid Mulder (Anja)", "Robert Rook (Willem)", "Norbert van der Zwaan (Ronny Jansen)", "Femke van der Linden (Karin)", "Joyce Oomes (Astrid)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
