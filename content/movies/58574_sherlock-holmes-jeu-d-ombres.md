Car un nouvel grand esprit criminel s'est fait remarquer en Europe : le professeur Moriarty. Non seulement il est l\u2019\u00e9gal intellectuel de Holmes, mais sa capacit\u00e9 pour le mal, coupl\u00e9e \u00e0 une absence totale de conscience, pourrait effectivement lui donner l'avantage face au d\u00e9tective de renom. Lorsque le prince h\u00e9ritier d'Autriche est retrouv\u00e9 mort, les preuves, telle qu'interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es par l'inspecteur Lestrade, pointe le suicide. Sauf que Sherlock Holmes en a lui d\u00e9duit un assassinat... qui ne pourrait \u00eatre qu'une seule pi\u00e8ce d'un puzzle plus vaste et de beaucoup plus mauvais augure, con\u00e7u par le professeur Moriarty.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/psDXA4zuIixEg9MRueezlHuSJLg.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Downey Jr. (Sherlock Holmes)", "Jude Law (Dr. John Watson)", "Jared Harris (Professor James Moriarty)", "Noomi Rapace (Madam Simza Heron)", "Kelly Reilly (Mary Morstan)", "Geraldine James (Mrs. Hudson)", "Eddie Marsan (Inspector Lestrade)", "Stephen Fry (Mycroft Holmes)", "William Houston (Clarky)", "Affif Ben Badra (Tamas)", "Paul Anderson (Colonel Sebastian Moran)", "Wolf Kahler (Doctor Hoffmanstahl)", "Iain Mitchell (Auctioneer)", "Jack Laskey (Carruthers)", "Patricia Slater (Shush Club Maitre D')", "Karima McAdams (Shush Club Maitre D')", "Richard Cunningham (Businessman)", "Marcus Shakesheff (Hashisheen)", "Mark Sheals (Cock Fight Referee)", "George Taylor (University Student)", "Rachel McAdams (Irene Adler)", "Thierry Neuvic (Claude Ravache)", "Laurentiu Possa (Rene Heron)", "Carsten Hayes (Ballroom Photographer)", "Clive Russell (Captain Tanner)", "Michael Webber (Vicar)", "Mike Grady (Train Conductor)", "Thorston Manderlay (Alfred Meinhard)", "Daniel Naprous (Marko)", "Lancelot Weaver (Stefan)", "Vladimir Furdik (Andrzej)", "Alexander Devrient (Gypsy)", "Fatima Adoum (Gypsy)", "Stanley Kaye (Stanley)", "Martin Nelson (Commendatore)", "Mark Evans (Don Giovanni)", "Anthony Inglis (Conductor)", "Ian Wilson-Pope (Leporello)", "Pamela Hay (Elvira)", "Laurence Dobiesz (Servant)", "Peter Stark (German Officer)", "Roman Jankovic (German Officer)", "Fredrick Ruth (Ballroom Attendant)", "Jonathan Christie (Diplomat)", "James McNeill (Diplomat)", "Maitland Chandler (Banker)", "Joe Egan (Big Joe)", "Lasco Atkins (Bar Patron (uncredited))", "D.J.

As a Sherlock Holmes movie\u2026not so much. Unfortunately, watching this movie confirms my suspicions. This is a Hollywood version of Sherlock Holmes. No style, no finesse. A Sherlock Holmes movie should not be a Hollywood action rollercoaster. It should be intelligent, stylish, witty perhaps involving detective work and, above all, British. It didn\u2019t help that they enrolled Stephen Frey. This film is just not right.\r\n\r\nI really cannot stand the hostility between Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. There no justification for it in the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The slow motion scenes are nothing but annoying. The lame jokes are out of place in a Sherlock Holmes movie.\r\n\r\nIt gets a 5 out of 10 just because it\u2019s actually a decent movie\u2026if you can forget that they claim it to be a Sherlock Holmes one."}], "recommandations_id": [10528, 10764, 38356, 41154]}
