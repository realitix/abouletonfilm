Thus, it's not surprising that on the hottest day of the year, only three workers -- the manager, a high-school student and an ex-con -- are around to deal with the rush that occurs when the year's hottest film begins its exclusive engagement. It doesn't take long for an angry mob to form in this comedy co-starring Michael McKiddy, Sean Farley (who also directs) and Angela Roberts.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
