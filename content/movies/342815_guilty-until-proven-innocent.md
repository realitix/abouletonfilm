Due to a clerical mix-up (his police file has been confused with another McLaughlin) Bobby McLaughlin (Brendan Fraser) is wrongfully accused of a murder he didn't commit. Despite his pleas of innocence, not even his father (Martin Sheen) believes him. With a minor crime already on his record, and an incompetent defense attorney, Bobby is convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison. But a suppressed lie detector test that could have freed him convinces his father that Bobby is indeed innocent. Now he begins a fierce struggle to free his son from prison. \"Presumed Guilty\" is a chilling indictment of a faulty judicial system and an inspirational tale of love and reconciliation between father and son.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vSH8H2nEiOP9NGk9uTYvG8u6FkR.jpg", "actors": ["Martin Sheen (Harold Hohne)", "Caroline Kava (Mary Hohne)", "James Handy (Gerry Duffy)", "Rebecca Schull (Beverly Rosen)", "Mark Metcalf (Ron D'Angelo)", "Christine Dunford (Kathy Panzer)", "Peter Friedman (Richard Emery)", "Tristan Tait (Jimmy O'Neill)", "Ren\u00e9e Estevez (Carol McLaughlin)", "Zachary Mott (Billy Ferro)", "Brendan Fraser (Bobby McLaughlin)", "Bingo O'Malley (Judge Mollen)", "Rohn Thomas (Doctor)", "Bill Dalzell (Armor)", "Lamont Arnold (Dealer)", "William Cameron (Nat Laurendi)", "Mark Joy (John Miller)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
