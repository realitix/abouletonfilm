A narrator tells us about a young woman who wants, more than anything, to be a ballerina. Thanks to animation, we see the problem: her legs make up about three-quarters of her height. She sees the impossibility of her dream and moves to a house on an isolated hill where she lives by herself, lonely, practicing her art, and then, in near despair, taking up knitting. Madness seems close at hand, but is there anything that can bring hope and pull her from her solitary, circumscribed life?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/idR3ZQbyALq6Pe6su8TVTNzV9a1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
