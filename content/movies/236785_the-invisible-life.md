He can\u2019t face going home. The images of the mysterious 8 mm films he found in Ant\u00f3nio\u2019s house after he passed away keep coming back to his mind. Hugo remembers the day when Antonio, his superior at the Ministry, told him that he was going to die. Indirectly, Antonio seemed to want to tell him something about Hugo himself. Hugo\u2019s desire to understand what had remained unsaid between the two of them, triggers other memories from the past. Hugo unexpectedly thinks back on the last time he saw the woman he loved, Adriana, and relives once more what he feels has been his unlived life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bwyudb1Iu1f7XNtV6F7sxsLvmIU.jpg", "actors": ["Filipe Duarte ()", "Jo\u00e3o Perry ()", "Maria Jo\u00e3o Pinho ()", "Pedro Lamares ()", "Susana Arrais ()", "Maria Ana Bernauer ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
