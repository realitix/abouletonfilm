We see his daughters, Mary and Anne, playing in the aftermath of a January, 1936, snowstorm. Next, indoors, the girls bring in a birthday cake and sing to Archie. He has Anne read to him from a children's book, and a year later, has her read aloud to show her progress. Anne and Mary dress up Pat the family dog in a dress and scarf and hold a tea party, chattering away. Archie's high-pitched voice provides narration on and off camera.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fJflZLxjSjp3BdsMTaeEp05Mk5N.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
