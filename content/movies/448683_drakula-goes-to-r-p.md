In the story, Dolphy has a half-brother (Navarro) who is based in London. One day, a package was delivered to him and since it was huge, he remarked: \u201cAng bait naman ng kapatid ko, nagpadala pa ng refrigerator.\u201d The ref turned out to be a coffin and when Dolphy opened it, there was Rod Navarro \u2014 deader than dead. I consider that a master stroke because from comedy, the audience was engulfed within moments by a horror scene that was scary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tNzqB43nTFeiW2tcvrkLSj7GsRs.jpg", "actors": ["Dolphy ()", "Rod Navarro ()", "Pugo ()", "Maritess Revilla ()", "Panchito ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
