Living with his parents, 17-year-old Juan (Walter Quiroz) hangs out with several intellectuals who would like to photograph the human soul. The girlfriend of the group's financier is Ana (Maria Luisa Mendonca), and Juan is attracted to her, despite the knowledge that she spent two years at a clinic because she was \"crazy.\" Juan sees Ana when he can and trains as a door-to-door salesman, but when the German photographer on the soul project gives him a viewfinder, it changes his life, putting him on the path to his later success as a Hollywood director. Shown in competition at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/20a7wnIK4SLSkS2nptebIeAtGhW.jpg", "actors": ["Miguel Angel Sola (Juan (adult))", "Maria Lu\u00edsa Mendon\u00e7a (Ana)", "Walter Quiroz (Juan (young))", "Xuxa Lopes (Lilith)", "Norma Aleandro (Mother)", "Villanueva Cosse (Father)", "Oscar Ferrigno Jr. (Martin)", "Arturo Maly (Jacobo)", "Daniel Fanego (Godoy)", "Alejandro Awada (Fausto)", "Carlos Briolotti (Lazaro)", "Luis Luque (Andr\u00e9s)", "Carlos Bermejo (Locutor do festival de cinema)", "Miguel \u00c1ngel Porro (Fot\u00f3grafo de praia)", "Francisco Ramalho Jr. (Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
