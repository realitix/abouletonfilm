A visual feast from the former painter who shows a creative command of celluloid, both figural and abstract. - Marilyn Ferdinand", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bXen9ruE3TL1cvfid5N8QtkgmEc.jpg", "actors": ["Ondine ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
