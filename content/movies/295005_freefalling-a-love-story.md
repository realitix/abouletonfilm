We fall madly in love and plan to stay together for the rest of our lives. Three months later, he is dead. Herbert was a BASE Jumper. Leaping off a cliff with nothing but a parachute, he loses his balance, slams into the rock face and falls to his death. His loss in the midst of my chemotherapy completely throws me. Why does he gamble his life away, while I fight for mine? Desperate for answers, I return to Lauterbrunnen, the scene of the accident where Andreas, his best friend and coach, introduces me to the world of BASE. The jumpers teach me not only about the sport, but about facing fears, harnessing and controlling them. To make the most of the life we get. In the Swiss Death Valley I slowly find my way back to life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Ae4GB0wmpPyCBCQWEZGNFHxjxnY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "MMgUWTMmcu4"}
