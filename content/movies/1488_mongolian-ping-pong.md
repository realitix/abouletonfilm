He and his family live without electricity and running water in a solitary tent home among the vast steppe grasslands. The magnificent landscape here has changed little since the days of Genghis Kahn. But life in the middle of nowhere can be exciting for a young boy. The smallest of details become big events for curious Bilike and his best friends Erguotou and Dawa. The mystery of the small white ball floating in the creek leads to questions about the world around them, as well as innocent mischief.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yVzn3We2n1rNgYhQVKLWCqLnUNX.jpg", "actors": ["Hurichabilike (Bilike)", "Dawa (Dawa)", "Geliban (Erguotou)", "Yidexinnaribu (Bilikes Vater)", "Badema (Bilikes Mutter)", "Wurima (Schwester Bilikes)", "Dugema (Gro\u00dfmutter)", "Jinlaowu (LKW-Fahrer)", "Buhebilike (Dawas Vater)", "Sarengaowa (Dawas Mutter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
