Barely surviving the tragedy herself, Martha was struck dumb due to the shock. Now an adult, the still mute Martha lives with her uncle Ralph in the Spanish countryside. Martha's cousing Jenny arrives to be with the family but is quickly stabbed to death. It appears that a sex maniac is roaming the countryside; killing pretty young girls. The already traumatized Martha seems likely to be the next victim but the case turns out to be far more complicated than it would first seem.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fBuHoT7HhfIWqm2yjTkD0b6kXGr.jpg", "actors": ["Carroll Baker (Martha Caldwell)", "Alan Scott (Dr. Laurent)", "Ida Galli (Jenny Ascot)", "Eduardo Fajardo (Marcos)", "Silvia Monelli (Annie Britton)", "George Rigaud (Ralph)", "Franco Fantasia (Inspector Duran)", "Dada Gallotti (Mayor's Wife)", "Lorenzo Robledo (Vice Commissioner)", "Olga Gherardi (Rosalie)", "Jos\u00e9 Marco (Father Martin)", "Luca Sportelli (Capo Stazione)", "\u00c1ngel Men\u00e9ndez (Judge)", "Fabi\u00e1n Conde (-)", "\u00c1gata Lys (-)", "Antonio Orengo (-)", "Ricardo Valle (-)", "Rosa M.
