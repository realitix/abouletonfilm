He finds a call for help in a Chinese fortune cookie and decides to investigate. Acting on a tip displayed on a solo musician's drum, Daffy/Jones goes to a pub owned by Limey Louie to look for clues. Louie is, in fact, an ex-convict who blames Jones for sending him to jail. Louie disguises himself as a grieving widow and arranges a series of mishaps for the web-footed sleuth. Porky Pig also appears in this cartoon as Charlie Chung, the plain-clothes Chinese detective.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6sqQynovteeZo36s1pknBTK1ru8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
