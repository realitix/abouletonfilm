The disc includes three stories to keep kids entertained as they learn about values such as cooperation and improve their problem solving skills. Mo Willems is a great children\u2019s book author, so any issues with the release don\u2019t stem from his work, but rather from the price for a single DVD release with only three stories when Scholastic will inevitably be releasing them as part of a larger set down the road (if they haven\u2019t already) for a better value.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kgve61sWnfBFNjQDCC3ArbS1KpY.jpg", "actors": ["Mo Willems (Pigeon (voice))", "Jon Scieszka (Bus Driver (voice))", "Trixie Willems (Duckling (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
