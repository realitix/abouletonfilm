It was as if life had handed her a card she felt forced to play. She began a journey into the past, back into the childhood of her Russian mother and her five sisters, all of whom struggled with fear, famine and war in Stalin\u2019s Russia; experiences that left them scarred to their very soul. Aliona\u2019s quest into the lives and fate of her family becomes a loving, poignant, and poetic film with Chekhovian characters. Accompanied by the magical animation of acclaimed Italian artist Simone Massi, unimaginable events in the Soviet past are given an immediate charge. Along with the stories of ordinary people living in the small farmhouse, the film maker tells the tale of Soviet terror, immense bravery and a fear that has never left those four walls.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d4DKV8JTgc7MLKO8ZVqMdUeoYlG.jpg", "actors": ["Aliona van der Horst (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
