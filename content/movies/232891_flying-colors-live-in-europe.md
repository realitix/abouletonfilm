Flying Colors launched in 2012 following a formation that began with a simple idea: virtuoso musicians and a pop singer joining together to make new-fashioned music the old fashioned way. Refreshing, classic, old and new, the recordings are saturated with the many styles, tones and hues of the players who in becoming a band delivered a unique fusion of vintage craftsmanship and contemporary music. Live In Europe captures the quintet in Tilberg, Holland performing at 013 on September 20, 2012.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zOdRW8nkqMgBcOeRBmLYoEXCs3N.jpg", "actors": ["Mike Portnoy (Drums)", "Dave LaRue (Bass)", "Neal Morse (Keyboards, Vocals)", "Steve Morse (Guitars)", "Casey McPherson (Vocals)", "Flying Colors ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
