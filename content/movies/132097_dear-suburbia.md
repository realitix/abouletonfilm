It is a high-performance, location-based surf film set against exotic landscapes, objects and personalities juxtaposed with the traditions of suburban life. Spontaneity versus routine. The unknown versus the familiar. An interpretation of our lifestyle, culture, riding waves, traveling the world \u2014 a pirouette into the absurdity of it all. The result is a graceful, often schizophrenic glimpse at modern life with a surfboard and a passport.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6h4IjqWSZbTx8Y9nUBaIvgNumnK.jpg", "actors": ["Craig Anderson (Himself)", "Taj Burrow (Himself)", "Dane Reynolds (Himself)", "Dion Agius (Himself)", "Yadin Nicol (Himself)", "Dusty Payne (Himself)", "Evan Geiselman (Himself)", "John John Florence (Himself)", "Jack Freestone (Himself)", "Conner Coffin (Himself)", "Dillion Perillo (Himself)", "Mitch Coleborn (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
