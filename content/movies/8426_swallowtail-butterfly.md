The city is called Yentown, and it is much like Tokyo. Sixteen-year-old Ageha (Ito), a young girl whose mother has just died, is passed on from person to person until a prostitute named Glico (Chara) finally takes pity on her. Under Glico's care, Ageha has many experiences with the other poverty-stricken immigrants in Yentown. Eventually, due to a sudden twist in fate, the immigrants are given a chance to realize their dreams. But in doing so, they destroy their solidarity, and have to face their problems separately.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3VmVx9X39w6FIOjiXBUXn3ojmuG.jpg", "actors": ["Ayumi Ito (Ageha)", "Chara (Glico)", "Hiroshi Mikami (Feihong)", "Yosuke Eguchi (Ryou Ryanki)", "Atsuro Watabe (Ran)", "Andy Hui (Maofuu)", "Tomoko Yamaguchi ()", "Mickey Curtis (Doctor)", "Tadanobu Asano (Customer in club)", "Kaori Momoi ()", "Nene Otsuka ()", "Yoriko D\u00f4guchi ()", "Tetsu Watanabe ()", "Ken Enomoto ()", "Toshiyuki Kitami ()", "Kenji Kohashi ()", "Kae Minami ()", "Ken Mitsuishi ()", "Toshiya Sakai ()", "Sansei Shiomi ()", "Keiichi Suzuki ()", "Tomoro Taguchi ()", "Hajime Yamazaki ()", "Hua Rong Weng ()", "Kaori Fujii ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [353760, 67235, 24041, 175952], "youtube_key": "Z4BxdaRRucQ"}
