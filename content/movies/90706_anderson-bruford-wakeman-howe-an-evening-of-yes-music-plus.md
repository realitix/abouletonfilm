In 1989 vocalist Jon Anderson, drummer Bill Bruford, keyboardist Rick Wakeman, and guitarist Steve Howe released the gold-selling Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe album (complete with Roger Dean cover art) and embarked on a tour called \"An Evening of Yes Music Plus.\" The Evening of Yes Music Plus DVD, directed by Jim Yukich, was filmed at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, CA -- the exact date is not listed in the credits -- and it presents a nearly equal blend of songs from the new album and Yes classics.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xmR9BlRuIYrdhdYbuY36hfttlo0.jpg", "actors": ["Jon Anderson (Himself - Vocal)", "Bill Bruford (Himself - Drums)", "Rick Wakeman (Himself - Keyboard)", "Steve Howe (Himself - Guitar)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
