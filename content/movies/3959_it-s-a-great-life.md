Thus it was that Columbia's 13th \"Blondie\" picture was shipped out as It's a Great Life.  The comic confusion begins when Dagwood Bumstead (Arthur Lake), intending to buy a house, buys a horse instead.  Before the film's 75 minutes have run their course, Dagwood gets mixed up in a fox hunt.  But Blondie (Penny Singleton) saves the day as usual, with the help of eccentric millionaire Timothy Brewster (Hugh Herbert).  After It's a Great Life and #14 \"Footlight Glamour\", Columbia restored the name \"Blondie\" to the titles of all subesequent installments in this long-running comedy series.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6wESNXSgvDS7EID9HDlTBhG1njY.jpg", "actors": ["Penny Singleton (Blondie Bumstead)", "Arthur Lake (Dagwood \" Dag \" Bumstead)", "Larry Simms (Alexander Bumstead)", "Marjorie Ann Mutchie (Cookie Bumstead)", "Daisy (Daisy)", "Hugh Herbert (Timothy Brewster)", "Jonathan Hale (J.C.
