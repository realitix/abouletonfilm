A gang of rat-munching, homophobic bums kill the night clumsily. Jesus H. Christ gets crucified for the nth time in Dagger Island. A greaseman, the image model for Poverty, bums around the Edsa Revolution anniversary which ousts another corrupt president, Estrada the actor. And Tony D., the shrewd short-fused citizen of the Philippine ghetto, sets his sights on foreign classmate Steve Banners, a pompous self-righteous dude with delusions of America's grandeur at the expense of Third World inequity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jqm6H5faZ4AJkVF2McTuxODgE7P.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "fZxdrA5MZ_M"}
