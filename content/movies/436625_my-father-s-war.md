There he meets his father as a young man, when he was a member of the Special Forces. As they go through combat together, the son gets to know his father in a way he never has, giving him insight and compassion, and he is able to let go of lifelong feelings of abandonment, resentment and anger. This leads to forgiveness and a real-life reconciliation, which drives home the underlying message of this film restoring the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9AIuZYTQgLCGX2zd7c9Sc73564a.jpg", "actors": ["Stian Bam (Dawid Smit)", "Edwin van der Walt (Benjamin 'Dap' Smit)", "Erica Wessels (Karina Smit)", "Fumani Shilubana (Floyd Mabela)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "1qvfCPYf_yc"}
