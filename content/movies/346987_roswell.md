Brown...seems to take the event seriously. He wonders what the craft was doing in Roswell of all places, speculating that it was piloted by a 'star boy...joyriding through the cosmos' who 'got lost and lost control.' But Brown also sees his subject playfully, as if through a child's eyes-- objects suggest others, nothing has a stable meaning... The fish-eye lens used for some landscape shots curves the horizon line, making the sky seem enclosed-- navigable, traversable. In the film's strongest image, Brown stands facing the camera with a sheaf of papers in hand, as an animated drawing of a spaceship scoots across the paper, suggesting a connection between UFO fantasies and the magical possibilities of cinema.\" -Fred Camper, Chicago Reade", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f0gcjWBoztuDPmcVSK9IfkLQG4U.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
