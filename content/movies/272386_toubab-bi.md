In this story, Soriba heads to Paris, accompanied by the five-year old son of a friend who he believes to be still living in Paris. On arrival he struggles to find the boy\u2019s father. In addition to coping with his new internship, Soriba has to also spend time tracking down the boy\u2019s father \u2018Issa\u2019. Soriba eventually finds \u2018Issa\u2019 but only to discover that he is running a prostitution ring and actually has no intention of leaving Paris. This is deeply disturbing to Soriba as the fate of the young boy now hangs squarely in the balance. Soriba sets out to change this and invokes the spirits of his ancestors to transform \u2018Issa\u2019s\u2019 wayward living so he can care for his son and return to Senegal.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/etEN1UGsD4kjdFqBudEaSK7psYn.jpg", "actors": ["Makena Diop ()", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Lapiower ()", "Khalil Gueye ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
