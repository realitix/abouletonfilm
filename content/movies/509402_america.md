When their father is hauled away, a colorful trio of brothers \u2014 a sibling team to rival Moe, Larry, and Curly \u2014 step up to take care of Am\u00e9rica, their grandmother, in Colima, Mexico. Rodrigo, Diego, and Bruno are stilt-walkers and acrobats and Elvis impersonators and unicycle riders \u2014 when not running the family's agriculture warehouse. With a loose, offhanded charm, Stoll and Whiteside capture the family\u2019s natural performative streak in a way that makes even the most explosive, dramatic moments feel organic. The endearing, genuine scenes between Diego and his grandmother celebrate the possibility of multigenerational connection.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hvdtyGU4HNkbLLMCa8gsbGm6TH2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
