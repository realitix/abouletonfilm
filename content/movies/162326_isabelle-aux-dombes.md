The film is an entirely silent montage of documentary footage, ragged experimental techniques \u2014 mainly some negative-image inserts \u2014 and symbolic psychodrama that's surprisingly not too different from the work that Stan Brakhage would begin making just a year or two later. Images of death proliferate throughout the film, and what started as a loose documentary soon becomes an eerie psuedo-horror piece that's obsessed with death and decay.
