The croft is West Aith, on the edge of a small loch, which almost every passing visitor stops to photograph or draw or paint. I have been filming this beautiful place since 1977, observing many of the human activities which alter and define how it looks.\" Margaret Tait", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/586O4Q4EwJvDuDVvsIMDQFKBx57.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
