Two young poachers, more boys than men, kill a gamekeeper when they are caught illegally hunting. Panicked, they retreat into a forest that grows steadily more forbidding and deadly as their fear for the future\u2014and guilt over their action\u2014mounts. Loosely based on hundreds of oral folk tales and legends that haunt the woods of Czechoslovakia, Vl\u00e1cil\u2019s contemporary updating artistically underscores the relationship between man and nature, crime and punishment, isolation and society, and guilt and memory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mz9TZRxFQvSOS5NtKPFUTg9GlvC.jpg", "actors": ["Marek Probosz (Ruda Aksamit)", "Zbigniew Suszy\u0144ski (Va\u0161ek Kala)", "Miroslav Mach\u00e1\u010dek (Keeper / vagabond / beggar)", "Franti\u0161ek Peterka (Father Aksamit)", "Josef Pato\u010dka (Elsner)", "Vladim\u00edr Hlavat\u00fd (Cepelka)", "Marie Je\u017ekov\u00e1 (Cepelkov\u00e1)", "Old\u0159ich Velen (Tutelary)", "V\u00edt\u011bzslav Jand\u00e1k (Policeman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
