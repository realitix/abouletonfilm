For Myra Harper, age 21, it's time to stop \"playing around\" and find a husband, and the unsuspecting, handsome, shy and quite wealthy Knowlton Whitney is the perfect target. Romance, it seems, will work quite well with Myra and Knowlton. For they fall in love and it's time to meet his outrageously eccentric family and the bizarre characters who inhabit Whitney mansion! Suddenly Myra is caught on a comic roller coaster of events trying to save her romance. Sean Young Take a spin through this delightful PBS adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's charming \"Myra Meets His Family\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o7c6sVMKEsPNqk0CNWCgJkkm8uG.jpg", "actors": ["Sean Young (Myra Harper)", "Lenny Von Dohlen (Knowleton Whitney)", "Barnard Hughes (Ludlow Whitney)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
