We follow Frode and Milla. They are having their first child, who they are told will not live long. We follow Bobbie-Pop, a faded singer who tries to commit suicide. We follow Leon, an institutionalized kleptomaniac who is loking for \u00c5sa, to whom he has a ten year old deal to get married. We meet Leon's brother, Trygve, who fetches Leon at the institution to celebrate his birthday, but who himself has plans to use his leave from prison to run away. And most of all we meet the angel Vidar, Leon's best buddy at the institution, who sees things no one else can see, and who may be able to save everyone - except himself?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uGpPiYt5uD4XtLrl0ZLCp6LEdiD.jpg", "actors": ["Trond Espen Seim (Vidar)", "Jan Gunnar R\u00f8ise (Leon)", "Evy Kasseth R\u00f8sten (Asa)", "Stig Henrik Hoff (Frode)", "Silje Torp (Milla)", "Petronella Barker (Bobbie)", "Robert Skj\u00e6rstad (Viggo)", "Benjamin L\u00f8nne R\u00f8sler (Mikkel)", "Ferdinand Falsen Hiis (Magne)", "Judith Darko (Tina)", "Aksel Hennie (Trygve)", "Morten Faldaas (John)", "Kjersti Elvik (Dorthe)", "Jon Erling Wevling (Mads)", "Stein Gr\u00f8nli (Overlege Krogh)", "Fridtjov S\u00e5heim (Doctor)", "Erland Bakker (Ambulance Driver)", "Andrine S\u00e6ther (Social Worker)", "Thorir S\u00e6mundsson (Social Worker's Assistant)", "Anders T.
