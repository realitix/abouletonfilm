Complicating matters, a nuclear warhead has been smuggled aboard as collateral for a rendezvous with another ocean liner, loaded with gold bullion. A cast full of supernovas, dazzling set &amp; stunt work, and a catchy theme tune by Jeff Wayne create a pleasing audio-visual experience light on logic but fast paced and entertaining nonetheless.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h4HpfjiOEOa8go867oQITWxbS4P.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Harris (John Carter)", "Ann Turkel (Susan Beresford)", "Gordon Jackson (Dr. Marston)", "John Vernon (Luis Carreras)", "David Janssen (Charles Conway)", "Burgess Meredith (Van Heurden)", "Leigh Lawson (Tony Cerdan)", "Robert Flemyng (Capt.
