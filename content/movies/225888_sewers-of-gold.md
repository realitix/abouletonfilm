Over a long weekend the vault of a particular bank will be stuffed with francs. And Bert knows a way in.....through a labyrinthine sewer system, a map of which he has obtained from a contact in the town hall.\r\n\r\nWith colleagues from former fighting days in Indo-China and Algeria, Jean (WARREN CLARKE) and Serge (CHRISTOPHER MALCOLM), Bert reluctantly has to recruit a band of professional criminals to assist in the robbery. The dangerous elements of crime and passionate politics make for uneasy bedfellows..........The criminals look on the job as merely a passport to money and the good life; they cannot understand Bert's ideological approach summed up as 'without arms....without hatred.....without violence'.\r\n\r\nAs the job is planned with meticulous and flawless detail, the personality clashes between the two factions become more and more defined.\r\n\r\nBut the heist goes perfectly and Bert finds more money than he ever dreamed of. There's fifteen million dollars: the biggest bank job in the world.\r\n\r\nThough the police are completely baffled at first, the criminal members of the robbery team are soon throwing their money around with reckless abandon. As they are caught one by one, Bert manages to avoid capture but in the end he, too, is cornered.\r\n\r\nEven so, he might still be able to offer the police a deal'\r\n\r\nThe above description was taken from the Video released in the UK on the Precision Video label - a great great film and well worth a couple of hours of everyone's time"}], "recommandations_id": [31785, 241760, 78842, 110468], "youtube_key": "TJYGWde1BU8"}
