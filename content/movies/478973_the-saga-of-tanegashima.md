Lord Tokitaka helped Captain Pinto repair his ship. The grateful captain offered the lord a gift--a matchlock musket\u2014the first firearm ever seen in Japan. But like a great stone hurled into placid waters, this simple gift will start a revolution. Tokitaka tasks Kinbei, his greatest swordsmith, to copy this musket and build guns for Japan. While Kinbei struggles to forge Japan\u2019s first musket, a great love blooms between Captain Pinto and Kinbei\u2019s daughter Wakasa. But for Kinbei, to let Wakasa marry Pinto and go to Portugal is unthinkable. And as Kinbei creates Japan\u2019s first matchlock factory, Lord Oda Nobunaga will seize upon firearms as the key to sweep all other clans before him, tearing a blood-soaked path of destruction through Japan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lFVoVCpWEPWPbmk3sm9yBcLn9s3.jpg", "actors": ["Rick Jason (Captain Pinto)", "Ayako Wakao (Wakasa)", "Eijir\u014d T\u014dno (Kinbei Yaita)", "Shiho Fujimura (Otane)", "Jun Fujimaki (Nobunaga Oda)", "Asao Koike (Matasaburo Tachibanaya)", "Ichir\u00f4 Nakatani (Sakuji)", "Rokk\u00f4 Toura (Wufeng)", "Ry\u00fbtar\u00f4 Gomi (Tokitada Oribenoj\u00f4)", "Taketoshi Nait\u00f4 (Tokiaki Tanegashima)", "K\u00f4ichi Mizuhara (Shigeomi)", "Saburo Date (Tokunoshin Wakita)", "Gen Kimura (Tokuz\u00f4)", "Flemming Pedersen (Wakami)", "Jun Fujikawa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
