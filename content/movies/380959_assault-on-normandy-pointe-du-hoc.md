Despite their thorough training scaling techniques that included sectional aluminium commando ladders, rocket grapples and ropes experienced commanders predicted a disaster. In the event bad weather, navigational errors and communications failure meant that less than 200 Rangers were delivered to the foot of the cliffs late and under enemy fire. Small groups of Rangers battled their way up ropes and ladders, with grenades bursting around them, to scale the muddy unstable cliff. A handful of men spread out and cleared the stunned defenders but, as often is the case, seizing the objective was only a part of the battle. Isolated for over 24 hours, with no relief from the near disaster at Omaha, the Rangers fought on against increasingly determined German counter-attacks.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fixrtIqcor7CjAebryh3GxoGpRN.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Dormer (Presenter)", "Tim Saunders (Presenter and Director)", "Richard Hone (Presenter)", "Andrew Duff (Presenter & Producer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "oX_9LSNR0AU"}
