Standing on the perimeter of Rome like a monolith in the open countryside is a municipal housing complex from the 70s: Corviale. This ravaged concrete structure, which stretches for over a kilometer, has become the embodiment of a failed utopia from an urban planner's drawing board. The film interweaves the vistas of this fascinating architectural monstrosity with the ways the inhabitants see their living space.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
