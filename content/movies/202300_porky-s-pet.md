But first they have to get there, and the train conductor won't let the ostrich board. Porky sneaks her on. She gets loose and eats a sleeping woman's wig, a boy's toy airplane, and a concertina. Porky hides her in a guitar case, but she gets out as the conductor comes by, and they are both thrown off. They enlist a hand cart and a cow to outrun the train.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/30Eo6UMNH8trjNv0FKEVskdb7HR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
