While the band is just about totally forgotten today, they had a nice sound and are a nice representative of the era. And, like most Vitaphone films of the day, the camera is mostly stationary and there are no fancy effects--just a straight recording of the act--which included several nice songs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4Agghc1okQSBbrY6u3v8Mllbzls.jpg", "actors": ["Gus Arnheim (Himself)", "Sunny Howard (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
