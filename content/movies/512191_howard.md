He and his artistic partner, composer Alan Menken, scored an Off-Broadway sensation with their musical redux of Little Shop of Horrors. And, when Disney snatched up the two in the mid-\u201980s, they revitalized the struggling Mouse House with hits like The Little Mermaid and Aladdin. When the lyricist and librettist died of AIDS-related complications, at age 40, in 1991, one of his biggest triumphs\u2014Disney\u2019s instant classic Beauty and the Beast\u2014wouldn\u2019t hit theaters for another six months.  Told entirely through rare archival footage and interviews with Ashman\u2019s family, friends, associates, and longtime partner Bill Lauch, Howard is an intimate tribute to a once-in-a-generation talent and a rousing celebration of musical storytelling itself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/twnVEJ00TORcbf2oFgid7qCKPWk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "l70W1cYZeRA"}
