Artiego is at presently working incognito, as military governor of the North African city of Tangier. Maria finds an unexpected ally in the form of Artiego's discarded mistress Dolores (Louise Allbritton). Dominating the film's hotel-lobby set is an old-fashioned \"open\" elevator, which will obviously figure prominently in the climax. A camp classic, Tangier is distinguished by supporting actor Sabu's offkey renditions of such American standards as \"Polly Wolly Doodle\" and \"She'll be Comin' Round the Mountain\"!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qSYP714JfWkMDLWc29ncE7NoXNr.jpg", "actors": ["Maria Montez (Rita)", "Robert Paige (Paul Kenyon)", "Sabu (Pepe)", "Preston Foster (Col.
