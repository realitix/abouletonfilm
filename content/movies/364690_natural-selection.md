This movie follows all the tropes of a story about a nerdy high schooler. It tries to force a romance on the audience that you won't buy. The story was very predictable even though they tried to put their own spin on it. The ending was fairly obvious and even then left the viewer unsatisfied. The only saving grace was that the concept was a bit interesting. Good idea, poor execution."}], "recommandations_id": [392898, 373825, 429047, 105379]}
