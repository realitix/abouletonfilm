He earns the trust of the meek and hospitable monks. However, a Jewish girl, Anna - whom, while still a baby during the war, her father had entrusted to the care of the hermit Vasileios - continues to pretend she is a young monk. She manages gradually to discover the entire scheme and acts to foil their plot.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ln3pzsxt1Zbd3Dii3cr2lYIO9lh.jpg", "actors": ["Petros Fyssoun (Andreas)", "Manos Katrakis (Father Vasileios)", "Xenia Kalogeropoulou (Anna)", "Byron Pallis (Aldo)", "Mitsos Ligizos (Abbot)", "Haritini Karolou (Tina)", "Lakis Skellas ()", "Labros Kotsiris ()", "Giorgos Kyriakidis ()", "Giorgos Oikonomou ()", "Lazos Terzas ()", "Giorgos Rois ()", "Thodoros Kefalopoulos ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
