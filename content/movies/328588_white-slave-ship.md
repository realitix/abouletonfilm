The woman activist frees the dozen of low-cast women, and they take over the ship. After a storm, the captain takes back control of his ship. Since mutiny is punishable by death in the New World, the mutineers try to reroute the course, tossing Desny and Purdom in the brig. A practical male mutineer wants to throw the women overboard to save rations, but the women free Purdom and the captain to battle the mutineers. A British warship comes to the rescue, and the captain pardons Angeli and Purdom for having saved his life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7jYtgko8aKuPZKOEODSNQk49ABk.jpg", "actors": ["Pier Angeli (Polly (as Anna Maria Pierangeli))", "Edmund Purdom (Dr. Bradley)", "Armand Mestral (Calico Jack)", "Ivan Desny (Captain Cooper)", "Renato Speziali (Jimmy)", "Mich\u00e8le Girardon (Anna)", "Franca Parisi (Lady Graveston)", "Mirko Ellis (Lord Graveston)", "Maria Pia Luzi ()", "Aldo Berti ()", "Charles Borromel ()", "Tom Felleghy (Larsen (as Tom Felleghi))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
