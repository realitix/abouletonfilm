The set was funded in part through a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Net proceeds support further film preservation.  The box set covers the years from 1894 through 1931, when the motion pictures grew from a peepshow curio to the nation's fourth largest industry. This is the period from which fewest American films survive.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f34eEpEblyMgkVRycMCUTPgBJSj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
