Sparrooabb\u00e1n (Me and my little sister) shows what it\u2019s like to be a minority within a minority. Suvi describes how her little sister Kaisa wishes to be accepted as she is. Like her sister, Kaisa is a Sami, but also in a relationship with a woman, and she also works as a deacon. There are obviously more constricting communities in the film than only one.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pn3F2fpBdH7WyppjHhEaVA5AjXj.jpg", "actors": ["Suvi West (Herself)", "Kaisa West (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
