In Trois Femmes, three De Maupassant stories are dramatized, each conveying the central theme of women falling in love. In the first, a black female carnival entertainer causes an uproar when she falls in love with a white soldier. In the second, a young bride is pressured into having a baby to collect a huge inheritance. And in the final episode, a pregnant girl is \"adopted\" and protected by a small circle of friends. In standard De Maupassant fashion, each of the three stories in Trois Femmes is capped by a surprise twist.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A9UPZsfLtS87rj1JM1BfYh8Z9em.jpg", "actors": ["Marcelle Arnold ()", "Michel Bouquet (M.
