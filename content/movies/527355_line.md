The video is the centerpiece of a large project comprised of paintings and video inspired by the Jean-Luc Godard film Le M\u00e9pris. This project does not seek to analyze or critique the Godard film, but to use it as a model, as an inspiration, as a 'classical' language through which other stories can be told... I myself 'play' the roles of both Camille (B. Bardot) and Paul (M. Piccoli). In the Godard film, the characters meet over the recreation of Homer's Odyssey as a Hollywood-style film. In Line, my Homer, the representative of the noble, classical past or Father artist, is the American painter Barnett Newman. In the video, the characters struggle over how to recreate one of his classical 'zips.' This abstract expressionist gesture of presence, of affirmation is for them a mark of cancellation, of destruction. Are they wrong?\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kd0ZbGbj8PUk6HPFNKAvtC3r0Ks.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
