He discovers that, while his body is decaying, his libido still rages on -- unwittingly sparked by the gentle, kindly attentions of his daughter-in-law Satsuko, a chic, flashy dancer with a shady past. Pitiful and ridiculous as he is, Utsugi is without a trace of self-pity, and his diary shines with self-effacing good humor. At once hilarious and of a sadness, Diary of a Mad Old Man is a brilliant depiction of the relationship between eros and the will to live -- a novel of the tragicomedy of human existence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/armon7ji3B3VVfDTcXiCfdJK4FL.jpg", "actors": ["S\u00f4 Yamamura (Tokusuke R\u00f4jin)", "Ayako Wakao (Satsuko)", "Keiz\u00f4 Kawasaki (Jyokichi)", "Chieko Higashiyama (Hama, Tokusuke's wife)", "Chieko Murata (Tamako)", "Yatsuko Tan'ami (Mutsuko)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
