The documentary was broadcast by most 348 PBS affiliate stations on April 17, 2006.  Because of the controversial nature of the subject in Turkey, PBS attempted to give both sides a voice and produced a four expert panel discussion to be aired immediately afterwards. However, due to an intense lobbying effort by Armenian groups and some members of Congress, the follow-up panel discussion was cancelled on a third of those stations broadcasting the documentary over concerns of offending human rights groups and the descendants of Armenian Genocide survivors.  Produced in conjunction with Oregon Public Broadcasting, it was written and directed by Andrew Goldberg and narrated by Hollywood celebrities Orlando Bloom, Ed Harris, Laura Linney, Jared Leto, Julianna Margulies and Natalie Portman.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/39fNHZnIw6fdO7nansmqD5lvWD0.jpg", "actors": ["Julianna Margulies (Narrator)", "Ron Suny (Himself)", "Peter Balakian (Himself)", "Elizabeth Frierson (Herself)", "Vahakn Dadrian (Himself)", "Taner Ak\u00e7am (Himself)", "Orlando Bloom (Auguste Berneau (voice))", "Ed Harris (US Consul Leslie Davis (voice))", "Jared Leto ((voice))", "Laura Linney (Maria Jacobsen (voice))", "Tom Mardirosian ((voice))", "Natalie Portman (Aurora Mardiganian (voice))", "Paul Rudd ((voice))", "Nick Zelletz (Turkish Strength Society)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
