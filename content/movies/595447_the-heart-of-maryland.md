Alan Kendrick, son of a Virginia general, and Capt. Fulton Thorpe. Nancy, whom Thorpe has loved unwisely, follows him to Washington and commits suicide when she learns he will not marry her; as a result, Alan is forced to request his resignation. When Fort Sumter is fired upon, Alan, who admires Lincoln's principles, joins the Union Army though his father is among the Secessionist leaders; as a result, he is estranged from Maryland. Thorpe, who has joined the Confederacy as a spy, is responsible for Alan's arrest, but Maryland victoriously comes to his aid by ringing the alarm bell.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/79noXXhdR3pADxGa6tqo0U7N1Dw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
