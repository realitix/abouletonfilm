Laura takes it all in her stride. Though as she wildly races through the streets of Prague, her thoughts are running wild too. She has a crush on Luky, but he doesn\u2018t show much interest in her. Laura\u2018s parents live apart, and her mother is desperately looking for someone new. Jealousy, misunderstandings with her best friend \u2013 Laura\u2018s life is full of confusion. Sometimes, when she can\u2018t take it anymore, fantasy worlds evolve. When hope and fear push through the cracks of reality, it gets harder to keep her life in balance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l5lKOdQYz5ENbmS2HZvi2k9yCZV.jpg", "actors": ["Barbora \u0160tikarov\u00e1 (Laura)", "Toman Rychtera ()", "Ivan Martinka ()", "Veronika Pouchov\u00e1 ()", "J\u00e1chym Novotn\u00fd ()", "Adam Mi\u0161\u00edk ()", "Martina Kavanov\u00e1 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
