As high school classmates, they share their loneliness, get close quickly, and fill the emptiness in each other. Cream moves into K's place and they depend on each other like a family or lovers. Years go by, and K works for a record company and Cream becomes a lyricist, but they still live together, neither a couple nor friends.
