Howie's Shakey's Pizza franchise in Muncie, Indiana employs his whole family: wife, nine children and Howie himself. He is the representative of the American Dream: the chance to invest long hours and hard work in exchange for financial security for oneself and family. To watch Howie Snyder as he dickers for better treatment by the Shakey's chain, as he seeks additional financing to stave off looming bankruptcy and as he sits morosely counting an evening's disappointing receipts is to watch America at work. And to see Howie's family rally around him in the hour of his greatest need is a heartwarming experience.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7EHftlTYoptf8BbqKAHn7GzqnS8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
