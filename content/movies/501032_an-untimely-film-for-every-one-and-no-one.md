The film was intended as an adaptation of Nietzsche\u2019s \u201cThus Spoke Zarathustra\u201d in the contemporary Arab world. Since that initial material was collected, much of the region and the world have been thrown into ever-greater tumult. An attempt is made to approach the material in a collective manner and make an untimely version of it. For Nietzsche, untimely meant something not belonging to the order of the tastes, expectations, and procedures of its time. If the original film was to stage an encounter between the writing and thinking of Nietzsche and the contemporary conditions of life as manifested in the Arab world, then this film stages that encounter in the lapse and disordering, in the historical black hole which has opened up in the ten years since the meeting was staged.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
