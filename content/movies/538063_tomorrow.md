In the evening, he joins his wife in their dingy apartment, and together they reminisce about their son, a student in Minsk they rarely see. Possibly their only excitement of the week is buying a lottery ticket, which, for a few seconds, gives them a chance to dream. Yuliya Shatun\u2019s camera, at first oddly focused on the white expanses along every roadside, then begins to scrutinise the teacher in his comings and goings \u2013 a precise recording with, however, a hint of the moroseness of a terrain so rare in today\u2019s cinema. The teacher has stoically adapted to a degenerate world and a life fuelled by stifled shame. An odour of neglect wafts between the apartment blocks, the uttered words and the background noise of the television. A certain irony floats in the air too, and it needs Yuliya Shatun\u2019s patience to grasp and take responsibility for it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A2Pj5sDLcUzCJthh5qU7QWeJRL9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
