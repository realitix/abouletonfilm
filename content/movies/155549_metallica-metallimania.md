Like \"Some Kind of Monster\", \"Metallimania\" was also financed with METALLICA money for the band's own private amusement, a way to document what was then the longest tour of its career: nearly three years playing all over the world in support of its self-titled 1991 album. Cribbed from thousands of hours of camcorder footage taken at outdoor festivals, \"Metallimania\" freezes in amber for future generations the group in its last mullet-wearing \"ALCOHOLICA\" days and some of METALLICA's drunkest, scariest and most confused devotees.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aKsDfofBZjvCNm64vHyrfMLpNYa.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
