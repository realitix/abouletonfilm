And the best indie documentary to have emerged so far from the HKSAR is this year's Yellowing, by Chan Tze Woon, a 29-year-old with degrees in policy studies and film production. Hong Kong's fraught, tense relationship with its mainland Chinese overseers came to a head with the Umbrella Movement of 2014. A crowd of protesters stormed Civic Square on September 27. The next day police shocked most residents of the HKSAR by attacking the growing crowds with volleys of tear gas, whereupon a wide cross section of Hong Kongers occupied the streets in several areas and stayed for almost 6 weeks. Chan took his camera on the streets for 67 days during these events.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Asy8d23XM2e4SciGfogxE1KX7G4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
