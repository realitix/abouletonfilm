Lan (Nicole Seelig) is a Vietnamese prostitute whose rotting teeth and odd affliction, which causes her to turn comatose after an orgasm, is impeding her marketability. She soon finds herself in an unlikely romance with Haitian Carlos (Elie James Blezes), who schemes to sell his kidney for enough money to immigrate to Australia. Meanwhile, tyro hitmen Branko (Misel Maticevic) and Merab (Lasha Bakradze) dilly-dally with their assignment to kill a businessman. Merab bores his Croatian counterpart by regaling him with stories about his native Georgia -- in between vomiting out of anxiety.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xvnQUGtM9uNYlxl2tKBNgV8ZElO.jpg", "actors": ["Nicole Seelig (Lan)", "Mi\u0161el Mati\u010devi\u0107 (Branco)", "Lasha Bakradze (Merab)", "Elie James Blezes (Carlos)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
