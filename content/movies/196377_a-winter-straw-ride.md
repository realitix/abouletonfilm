As they pass by a group of children, the children throw snowballs at the riders, and they and other persons begin to join in the fun. Then one of the carts tips on its side, spilling some of its occupants into the snow. Everyone soon decides that they enjoy playing in the snow even more than riding.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mQusEfPP3rfuXbLz0eSHSEXit8o.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
