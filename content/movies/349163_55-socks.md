It's the closing months of the war in occupied Holland and some women unravel a beautiful bedspread in order to knit 55 socks to barter for food. Reaching back into his childhood memories, Hoedeman has made a simple, poetic film of rare beauty.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4jh4jOOLuZWcNzaxY4L093oGra2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
