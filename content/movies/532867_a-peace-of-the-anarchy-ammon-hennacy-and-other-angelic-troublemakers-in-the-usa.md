Folks from the War Resisters League, the IWW, Earth First! and the Catholic Worker, along with Mr. Hennacy exemplify the marginalized prophetic witness for peace and justice in the USA as they attempt to appeal to the dominant culture. These people speak on the benefits of anarchy and peace, following the radical (rooted/basically grounded) ideology and optimism that goodness will overcome evil, love is superior to hate and truth trumps falsehood.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6yUoUP2gfYVIc5ZduRJu6nAx41P.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
