The members of this gang are all bored teenagers from rich families. One of the gang prefers playing pin pall to getting a girlfriend, because playing pin ball literally gets him off. The leader of the gang indulges in violent sexual fantasies, which ultimately leads to rape and murder. This inspires a teen gang from the streets, whose members are poor kids from the ghetto.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uyXptnz7cbxBBXcuzesZN9ZMgkD.jpg", "actors": ["Gino Barzacchi (Gorilla)", "Alicia Bruzzo ()", "Cristina Businari (Gianna)", "Paola Corazzi ()", "Marco Zuanelli (Nerone)", "Emilio Locurcio (Schizzo)", "Gino Milli (Marco Garroni)", "Mario Cutini (Gino)", "Francesco Pau (Franco)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
