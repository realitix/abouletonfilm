The music was composed and performed live on the set as the play unfolded. There But For is a free-form chance operation within the defined boundaries of place (an apartment) and the assigned roles of the players: the mother (bitch), the father (jerk), their kid (retard), and their visitors. The players continually argue as they feel their way through this structure, where ambiguity is the form. The kid asks, \u201cIs mediocrity its own reward?\u201d Perhaps the clue for the viewer is in the tape\u2019s title: There But For (the grace of God go I).\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xPD23mnzd81DfOx8ewfWaWwcVke.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
