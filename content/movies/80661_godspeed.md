Even though his boss still calls him 'Elizabeth,' Jim loves his bike messenger job, because it enables him to be doing one of his favorite things: going fast. Really fast. The other thing he loves doing is his genius punkstar stripper girlfriend, Ally, who keeps critical theory and lube on the nightstand. She'd live in a paper box with him, and Jim has given up speed (in its drug form) to be with her. But when he plays hooky for love and gets fired, addiction calls, and he gambles on the one person who really understands him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x4uBBBMvhmekRT4qAK1dNvFKdgW.jpg", "actors": ["Lynn Breedlove (Jim)", "Adam Horovitz (Repulski)", "Juba Kalamka (Weed Man)", "Jillian Lauren (Ally)", "Leslie Mah (Frankie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "lZfSEYlix3k"}
