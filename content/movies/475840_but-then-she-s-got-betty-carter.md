Uncompromised by commercialism throughout her long career, she has forged alternative criteria for success \u2014 including founding her own recording company and raising her two sons as a single parent. Parkerson's special film captures Carter's musical genius, her paradoxical relationship with the public and her fierce dedication to personal and artistic independence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sQYtJrwkSxUsRyWJxjefkCqZoXc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
