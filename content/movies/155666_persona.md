Squarely confronting a gang of ruffians, it is soon discovered that behind the mask is none other than Danta, an otherwise weakling student who has heretofore been picked on relentlessly by these same bullies. Donned with his mask, however, Danta exhibits a totally other personality, lacking fear and intimidation. The other students, looking on, soon experiment with the power of masks and find to their glee that behind a facade of anonymity, they experience an overwhelming power to act without the confines of self-consciousness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3bjm8sDFyFs10Tm2vnyuIqBgfir.jpg", "actors": ["Tatsuya Fujiwara (Akira Dojima)", "Maya Kurosu (Yuki Kawamura)", "Ikkei Watanabe (Mamoru Yaba)", "Yuma Ishigaki (Ashihara)", "Chiaki Kuriyama (Reika Dojima)", "Maaya Ono (Danta's Girlfriend)", "Ayumi Shigemori (Hiromi Nosaka)", "Akaji Maro (Daimon)", "Ren Osugi (Yuichiro Jonouchi)", "Hiromitsu Suzuki (Deguchi)", "Hirotaro Honda (Detective Sugawara)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
