Troost, adapted from the best-selling children's book by Rose Lewis. Based on Lewis's own experiences adopting a baby girl from China -- and traveling to the ends of the earth to bring her home -- these stories underscore that an adoptive mother's love for her baby is just as fierce as that of a woman who's gone through childbirth.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
