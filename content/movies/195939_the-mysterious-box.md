A juggler summons two chairs, which come to the stage jumping and twirling around. Across the back of these chairs the operator places a sheet of glass on which he lays a box about four inches high. He then takes a table cover, with his servant's help, rolls it up and from the centre emerges a lady, beautifully dressed. At the juggler's order she jumps in the box, in which she completely disappears.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2ngnUQX9Abkesfq72uvBF3uj4Es.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [106036, 106816, 195948, 108289], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
