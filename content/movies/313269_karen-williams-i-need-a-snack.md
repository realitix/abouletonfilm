Karen Williams brings her irreverent humor to a sold-out audience at the Knitting Factory in Hollywood, Calif. A pioneer in lesbian stand-up comedy, Williams talks about dating younger woman, the bygone days of tireless sex and more. The laughs continue with stories from a lesbian sex workshop, troublesome airline travel, the conundrums of Internet dating and other exploits. It's a sidesplitting hour of delicious humor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/RX5mxWTHoqADJhvFayFIvgs1Nr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
