Pennebaker's documentaries, so to me, this was a no-brainer to watch, especially this vintage. I was fortunate to catch Dylan live, after his life-threatening bout of pericarditis, in Ann Arbor, Michigan at the Hill Auditorium with the Kenny Wayne Shepherd band as support, but how amazing it would have been to have caught him live on this British tour, from a generation earlier.\r\n\r\nI would have given it a perfect rating, but I docked a mark for him making fun of Donovan, for crying out loud."}], "recommandations_id": [27375, 132, 99453, 64404], "youtube_key": "VY4HtQ-XJQE"}
