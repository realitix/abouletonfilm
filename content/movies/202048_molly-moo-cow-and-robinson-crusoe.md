Much of the short is Crusoe extolling the virtues of the solitary life, Molly trying to ingratiate herself to Crusoe and Crusoe trying to get rid of her. He finally succeeds-just before cannibals come ashore, capture Crusoe and dump him in a pot. From the time they grab him Crusoe is yelling for help (from whom is unclear, given that he wants the island to himself).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hxa8mH5zIbAg5F3n3GZcn7RTx9p.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
