He learns from his dim-witted best friend, Cody, a porcupine and street-con, that while he was in lock-up, the entire forest was picked clean by The A.C.O.R.N.S. Institute (Alternative Cosmetic Oils for Regenerative Natural Skin-care). No acorn was left behind. With winter just around the corner, it's a potentially devastating blow to all forest critters. So, Frankie has no choice but to bust into the brand new, state-of-the-art, rodent-proof A.C.O.R.N.S. Processing Plant and take back all of the acorns! Though a seemingly impossible heist, success would not only save the lives of his forest friends, but it would also give Frankie a chance to win back the love of his life, Lola, a local \"show squirrel.\" Sadly, Lola has been burnt by too many of Frankie's false promises in the past.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uGwFLc57MR0BFPBIQDITtVUP0MR.jpg", "actors": ["Victoria Justice (Lola (voice))", "John Leguizamo (Fly Boy / Liam (voice))", "Will Forte (Cody (voice))", "John Cleese (Mr. Bellwood (voice))", "Jason Jones (Frankie (voice))", "Jim Cummings (Edsy / Bear (voice))", "Samantha Bee (Raitch (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [385722], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
