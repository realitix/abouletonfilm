Ruby Rose (Melita Jurisic) is an Australian woman living with her Welsh immigrant husband Henry (Chris Haywood) in the Tasmanian highlands. Cut off from her superjudgmental family, for whom Henry had once worked as a humble farm hand, Ruby remains isolated in her tiny house. Superstitiously terrified of the dark, she begins developing her own folklore about the inky blackness that surrounds her each night; this folklore eventually develops into Ruby's own personal religion, created to ward off the evils that she imagines lurk in every corner. Only by venturing out of her house and rekindling her relationship with her embittered father is Ruby able to exorcise her fears. Almost hypnotic in its stark beauty, Tale of Ruby Rose is proof enough that writer/director Roger Scholes deserves to be far better known.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9KnEiGis38eAIZ8KTy9lpazGxWL.jpg", "actors": ["Melita Juri\u0161i\u0107 (Ruby Rose)", "Chris Haywood (Henry Rose)", "Rod Zuanic (Gem)", "Martyn Sanderson (Bennett)", "Sheila Florance (Gro\u00dfmutter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
