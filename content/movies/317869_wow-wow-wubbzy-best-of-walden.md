In his first-ever DVD collection, Walden bakes a marshmallow lasagna, gets sick with Chickenitis, plays his hoopty horn for a giant Goo Goo, collects figgety-fig leaves, and keeps a mysterious secret. There are silly dances, a day at the beach, wiggle worms, noodle stroodle and a trip to the peak of Mount Zubba Bubba, all with good friends.
