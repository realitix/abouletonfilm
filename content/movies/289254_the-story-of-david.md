The \"David and Goliath\" legend is presented as credibly as possible, while David's later disastrous romance with Bathsheba (Jane Seymour) is handled with taste and decorum. Also in the cast are Anthony Quayle as King Saul, and Terence Hardiman as Bathsheba's unfortunate warrior husband Uriah.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cnmVyOcBttC68RSs43qXdOo8u75.jpg", "actors": ["Timothy Bottoms (David)", "Anthony Quayle (King Saul)", "Norman Rodway (Joab)", "Oded Teomi (Jonathan)", "Yehuda Efroni (Younger Abner)", "Antonio Tarruella (Goliath)", "Ahuva Yuval (Abigail)", "Jane Seymour (Bathsheba)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
