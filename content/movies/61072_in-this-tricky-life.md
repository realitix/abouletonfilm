So, in the space of twenty-four hours, Elisa finds herself without a roof over her head, without a man, without a job and without money. Her best friend Loulou finds her a job - in the brothel run by Dona Jacqueline. And without really being aware of it, Elisa slides into prostitution, which leads her to Barcelona. She falls in love, she is exploited, she gets involved in transvestite gang wars, and meanwhile just dreams of earning enough money for her little beauty salon back home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Ab4uJjypLShq4Q8PXOFqRfBSbEn.jpg", "actors": ["Mariana Sant\u00e1ngelo (Elisa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [57289, 60850], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
