Though it is in the midst of World War II, they are relatively well-off. However, they glimpse the treatment accorded to POWs and others who are not so gently treated, and at the conclusion of the year's harvest, they choose to return to Hungary and are quickly swept up in the tides of war. This film is part of a series of films by award-winning, well-respected director Zoltan Fabri who devoted much time and effort chronicling the struggle against fascism.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/njLqhHoaovuAbSEM7XB1Kviz8aO.jpg", "actors": ["G\u00e1bor Koncz (Andr\u00e1s F\u00e1bi\u00e1n)", "Pap \u00c9va (Ilonka)", "J\u00f3zsef Bihari (Dani)", "Zolt\u00e1n Gera (Brajner)", "Tibor Moln\u00e1r (G\u00e1sp\u00e1r D\u00e1niel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [24588], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
