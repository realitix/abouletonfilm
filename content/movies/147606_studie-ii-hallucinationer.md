Accompanied by metallic sounds, various body parts, limbs and objects form surrealistic collages against the background of a black space. Peter Weiss intended to create associative images that can not be deciphered completely. Beyond any logical interpretation, he wanted to show pure inner feelings. In a conversation with Harun Farocki from 1980, Peter Weiss admitted in retrospect that the images had very well developed a strong psychological effect. Referring to the situation of his exile, he stated that \"this had to do with the traumatic as well as dreamlike experience of rupture and alienation.\"  (UbuWeb)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n4u6XSoK6VyrHOGIMvQu6oLtn4K.jpg", "actors": ["Eugen Alb\u00e1n ()", "Lars Forssell ()", "Lars Fredin ()", "Daniel Helld\u00e9n ()", "Gunnar Hyllienmark ()", "Gert Nyman ()", "Nils Ols\u00e9n ()", "Gunilla Palmstierna-Weiss ()", "Jan Thom\u00e6us ()", "Peter Weiss ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [148827, 145720, 153180, 47229], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
