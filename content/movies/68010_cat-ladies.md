Through the intimate portrait of four unique 'cat ladies' we create a sensitive and emotionally honest portrait of women whose lives and self-worth have become intractably linked to cats. It's not the number of cats that defines someone as a 'cat lady', but rather their attachment, or non-attachment, to human beings. They create a world with their cats in which they are accepted and in control - a world where they ultimately have value.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ffTgckBAFpokz5rqfkMSKQ1Uj1d.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "RCiRFVgXrOQ"}
