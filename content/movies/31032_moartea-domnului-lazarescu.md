When he starts feeling unusually ill, he first seeks painkillers from his neighbors. It soon becomes apparent that Lazarescu is indeed sick, and an ambulance arrives with a nurse (Luminita Gheorghiu) who has a few ideas about what could be the problem. However, a major traffic accident and poor organization leaves little room in Romanian hospitals for the fading Lazarescu.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hNy1U9Q9XWsw3FLxCjl66TM01yd.jpg", "actors": ["Ion Fiscuteanu (Mr. Lazarescu)", "Lumini\u021ba Gheorghiu (Mioara Avram)", "Doru Ana (Sandu Sterian)", "Monica B\u00e2rl\u0103deanu (Mariana)", "Alina Berzunteanu (Dr. Zamfir)", "Doru Boguta (Ambulantier)", "Alexandru Potocean (Brancardier, Spitualui Bagdasar)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [5055, 8905, 24159, 103740], "youtube_key": "OB5BktF00_Y"}
