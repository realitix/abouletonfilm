They live and train in an oasis of teen aged camaraderie and dreams for the future. But when bullfighting becomes banned in Bogota, the boys' sanctuary slowly becomes susceptible to society's larger struggles of class and conflict. Inspired by the watchful eye of retired bullfighter Nicolas, the bullfighting students strive to succeed first as Matadors, then as role models themselves. Interpreting bullfighting as a living metaphor for personal, social and historical struggles, the film focuses on the individual experiences of these boys and their mentor as they try to break free of the bleak future being dictated to them by Colombian society.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lfYsHZ9ebuBZzGa1TkruMOevvYO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "pEH_gHMuFGU"}
