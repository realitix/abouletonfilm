The entire first set was on fire, but the beginning of set two gives you a way to see Umphrey's like never before. Each member of the band is sporting a GoPro camera. You'll get a close up view of shredding guitar solos via Brenden and Jake's guitar cameras. You'll get bass slapping and head-banging via Stasik's head mounted GoPro. There's a combination of spacey and beautiful keyboard licks you'll see from the \"JoelPro,\" and you'll witness the heart of Umphrey's McGee beat through the chest-mounted cams worn by Andy and Kris as they power through \"1348\" and \"Day Nurse.\" What do you say Umphreaks, are you ready to join the band on stage?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kPRwryZbMdxVJvcbN8zdEia7hh3.jpg", "actors": ["Brendan Bayliss ()", "Jake Cinninger ()", "Ryan Stasik ()", "Joel Cummins ()", "Kris Myers ()", "Andy Farag ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
