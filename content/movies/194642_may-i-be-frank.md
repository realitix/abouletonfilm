He also wants to fall in love one more time before he dies. MAY I BE FRANK documents Frank\u2019s transformation as he stumbles into the aptly-named vegan Caf\u00e9 Gratitude, and, over 42 days, begins a life-changing journey during which he is coached physically, emotionally and spiritually by three twenty-something staff members on the path to enlightenment. Challenged by years of addiction, fatigue, and family dysfunction, Frank\u2019s quest for a healthier lifestyle is both tense and touching. Through Frank\u2019s metamorphosis, we witness the powerful effects of change upon one person\u2019s life, and the potential we all have to find the most important love of all\u2013love of ourselves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jLIOSjdywBFk0PbN7dRiNz4HRz6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
