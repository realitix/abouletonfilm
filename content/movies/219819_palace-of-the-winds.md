With spectacular images from inhospitable landscapes, chimerical phenomena that transpire by the sheer remoteness of the land, and haunting indigenous music from a people that have long been shrouded in mystery, this is a genre-defying film of profound beauty. Explore the intoxicating tapestry of sight and sound that this obscure region has to offer through its most awe-inspiring musicians. Featuring live performances by Group Doueh, Group Marwani, Sadoum Oueld Aida and Group Bab Sahara.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/29QMjgqjLOq0z9UEh0tolfMdC51.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
