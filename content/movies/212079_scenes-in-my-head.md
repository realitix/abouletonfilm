In Theo Taylor\u2019s perceptive lo-fi feature we out with such a trio over a weekend spent at Lake Tarawera.  Hadley, the mate, is in the throes of a breakup. Chris has joined him at his parents\u2019 well-appointed lakeside house, bringing along girlfriend Lucy to provide moral support. But all Hadley wants to do is party, and he\u2019s come very well provisioned. When Lucy gets delightedly trashed on night one, the drug-averse Chris begins to have second thoughts. Hadley\u2019s determination to (a) stay high and (b) provide water skiing lessons on the freezing lake sends Chris\u2019 ill-concealed need for control into further convolutions.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
