Half of the century-old Tua railway, that circulates between Bragan\u00e7a e Mirandela, is shut down by a political decision. Fifteen years later, the train's whistle echoes in the memory of the people from Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes. This decision cut the development of the country and increased disparities between the coastal and inland of Portugal, making it the most centralist country in Western Europe.
