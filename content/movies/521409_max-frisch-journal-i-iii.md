It is neither a biographical portrait of Frisch \u2013 who was one of the greatest 20th century Swiss writers \u2013 nor a filmed adaptation of the novel. Instead, Dindo returns to the locations the author describes in his texts, searching for traces of past events that may turn out to have been more imagined than real.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aCl6oqRYK8PJkOKaXjGua2YVb0K.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
