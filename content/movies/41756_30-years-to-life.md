It is a movie about 6 lifetime friends who are all hitting the big `3-0' together during the same year. Each one looks inside themselves to see where has my life gone and what am I going to do with my future. Actually, what I saw was a black Seinfeld comedy. Tracy Morgan, who is one of the main characters, is a struggling comedian just like Jerry Seinfeld. He gives his opinion of what women want in a man in one of his comedy routines. Melissa De Sousa is looking for a man before time runs out. She is just like Elaine in Seinfeld. I don't remember the big problem with turning thirty, however, all the characters in this movie can show you what they are, such as not having fame, riches, a husband, a thin body, and staying young. Their life stories are probably repeated many times around the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w93pS666vtqsHw67GCLbA17n909.jpg", "actors": ["Erika Alexander ()", "Melissa De Sousa ()", "Tracy Morgan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
