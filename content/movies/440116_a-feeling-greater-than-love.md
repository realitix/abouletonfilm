The old man at the wheel is calling for people to join a demonstration to support their brothers and sisters who\u2019ve occupied a tobacco company and are now being besieged by the army. His words come from the past, as he\u2019s referring to events from 1973 \u2013 events that few remember today. Neither the protests made by the tobacco farmers from the south against the large landholders\u2019 monopoly nor the strike for better working conditions by workers at a Beirut chocolate factory are anchored in the country\u2019s collective memory. All recollection of this social movement was erased by the civil war and society has since been marked by deep sectarian divisions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lm7u3mYHAAApKnw0VJpINDhYkmQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "hyAI4dWI0Js"}
