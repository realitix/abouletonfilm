More specifically, his obsession with motorbikes and the invention of the racing bike which was the by-product of his relationship with Stunt Double Bud Ekins and the film they were in together, 'The Great Escape'. As the two men shared their enthusiasm for motorbikes, it was a natural progression for them to work together in Bud's motorbike shop in California, fixing , tinkering and riding, and working to improve performance. This brought about their concept of combining a Metisse frame and a Triumph engine for a new track racing bike. McQueen decided to take this model to England where he met up with the Rickman brothers of Metisse motorbikes, and the 'Desert Racer' was soon born.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jxodhMXtPq9UAMsBA3gcSosTrmI.jpg", "actors": ["Armie Hammer (Armie Hammer)", "Chad McQueen (Chad McQueen)", "Charley Boorman (Charley Boorman)", "Steve McQueen (Steve McQueen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "l62s_L177r8"}
