Thinking that a zombie could never win her love, he changes his flesh-eating ways in order to win the girl of his dreams. The closer Dante gets to his desired love, the harder he finds it to maintain the facade, especially when his zombie friends encourage him to eat a teenage girl they have captured. What Dante doesn't know, however, is that Claudia is already in love with the zombie that saved her from the robbers and desperately tries to find him. This musical extravaganza, filled with singing, dancing, blood and gore, will have you laughing all the way to your grave!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5obJptTJvs0BIS5NxwVTbdlR9P8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
