Eun-sook, an assistant nurse who is the complete opposite of Gwang-ho's mother, becomes the object of all of Gwang-ho's attention and affection. Absorbed in his thoughts, Gwang-ho is oblivious of the news of the presidents death and the picture of the new president replacing the late president in his classroom. Gwang-ho receives a letter of luck and starts sending it to people around him. As those people start vanishing, Gwang-ho is racked with guilt, suspecting the letter of luck is the cause of their disappearance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Y7C8zg4O67T4XYZRbvSCz4z4IB.jpg", "actors": ["Moon So-ri (Mal-soon)", "Lee Jae-eung (Gwang-ho)", "Yoon Jin-seo (Eun-sook)", "Kim Dong-young (Chul-ho)", "Shin Dong-hwan (Terminal Clerk)", "Park Myung-shin (Jae-myung's mother)", "Lee Jin-sun (Student in Bus)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [265727, 99231, 107540, 64223], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
