But now she's blown it big time. One of the vibrators in her shop contained a super-sophisticated bomb. But Sharon lost track of it and sold it to Troye Layn who intends to give it to her girlfriend Diana Sloan. When she gets the gift home and her girl unwraps it, they try it out together. Little do they know that their kinky landlord Davis Christopher is watching through a two-way mirror. When the girls go out for a bite to eat, David steals into their apartment, puts on some of their clothes and makes off with the vibrator. But Sharon is right after him, on the trail of the vibrator, and she's willing to do anything to get it back.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/L60j2Tnj358DYnRzzT0OxmXB5N.jpg", "actors": ["Sharon Mitchell (Madame Suque)", "John Leslie (Man with Sunglasses)", "Joanna Storm (Phyllis)", "David Christopher (Howard)", "Diana Sloan (Sophie)", "Eric Edwards (Henchmen)", "Ron Jeremy (Freddy)", "Troy Scalpini (Angie)", "Veronika Rocket (Customer with Riding Crop)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
