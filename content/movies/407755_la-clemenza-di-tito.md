With a libretto by Metastasio (edited slightly by Caterino Mazzol\u00e0), the work dramatizes the palace intrigues surrounding emperor Titus's attempts to coronate a new bride and the envious Vitellia's attempts to have Titus assassinated (with the help of Titus's friend Sextus) following the deposition of Vitellia's emperor father. Stage director Martin Ku\u0161ej mounted Tito in August 2003, at the Felsenreitschule in Salzburg; a film of that live performance now appears in this home video release. The cast includes Michael Schade as Titus, Vesselina Kasarova as Sextus and Dorothea Roschmann as Vitellia. The Wiener Staatsopernchor, under the baton of Nikolaus Harnoncourt, provides musical accompaniment; Jens Kilian designed the sets.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9dH3Ly0fB5ZUCo4pF9AbM3BJBl0.jpg", "actors": ["Nikolaus Harnoncourt (Conductor)", "Michael Schade ()", "Vesselina Kasarova ()", "Dorothea R\u00f6schmann ()", "El\u012bna Garan\u010da ()", "Barbara Bonney ()", "Luca Pisaroni ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
