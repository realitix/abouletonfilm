Surveillance now the status quo, society is slowly putting its shattered pieces back together under a watchful eye. After a friend\u2019s suicide leaves behind a mysterious computer drive, a young computer prodigy and a shadowy hacker join together to decipher the clues that he\u2019s left behind. The youthful creators of Jackrabbit have successfully constructed a world, which we haven\u2019t previously seen on film.
