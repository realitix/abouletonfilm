Now defined as a collaboration between Michael Baldwin and Mel Ramsden this video work, Qui Pourra, depicts the artists\u2019 studio as a space of collaboration, conversation, reverie, industry and conversely, inactivity \u2013 with the work only revealing itself and any possible meaning incrementally over time, through a steady accretion of ideas.  Mapping text over their place of work and further superimposing their voices at work over this static image, Qui Pourra (which roughly translates as \u2018who can?\u2019) not only depicts the artistic process \u2013 of thought, action, discussion \u2013 but represents many areas of Art & Language\u2019s conceptual practice, combining as it does text, performance, painting, criticism and publishing.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
