When Chesney's \"Greatest Hits\" album was released in September 2000, it immediately took the No. 1 position on the charts. This video captures the country star in fine form in his music videos (\"Me and You,\" \"Don't Happen Twice\" and \"All I Need to Know\").", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
