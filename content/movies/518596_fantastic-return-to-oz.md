In the hands of Urfin is now the magic book of the sorceress Gingema, who fulfills any desire of her master, which means that the Scarecrow the Wise, the Brave Leo and the Iron Woodman are in danger. Ally, Totoshka and their new friend Tim decide to help the people of the Magic Country. Moreover, Tim likes Ellie, and what can't you do for the sake of love? For example, nonsense.
