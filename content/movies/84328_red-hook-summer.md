Fresh from his cushy life in Atlanta, he\u2019s bored and friendless, and his strict grandfather, Enoch, a firebrand preacher, is bent on getting him to accept Jesus Christ as his personal savior. Only Chazz, the feisty girl from church, provides a diversion from the drudgery. As hot summer simmers and Sunday mornings brim with Enoch\u2019s operatic sermons, things turn anything but dull as people\u2019s conflicting agendas collide.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eIPxN2if1LeafOKHiAWc9U4gU6R.jpg", "actors": ["Clarke Peters (Da Good Bishop Enoch Rouse)", "Nate Parker (Box)", "Thomas Jefferson Byrd (Deacon Zee)", "Toni Lysaith (Chazz Morningstar)", "Jules Brown (Flik Royale)", "Heather Simms (Sister Sharon Morningstar)", "Quincy Tyler Bernstine (Hazel)", "De'Adre Aziza (Colleen Royale)", "Kimberly Hebert Gregory (Sister Sweet)", "Colman Domingo (Blessing Rowe)", "Spike Lee (Mr. Mookie)", "Isiah Whitlock Jr. (Detective Flood)", "Al Palagonia (Detective Haggerty)", "Limary Agosto (Lourdes)", "Stephen Henderson (Deacon Yancy)", "Daniel Breaker (Cliff)", "Turron Kofi Alleyne (Butter)", "Tracy Camilla Johns (Mother Darling)", "James Ransone (Kevin)", "Sumayya Ali (Lil' Peace Of Heaven Baptist Church Of Red Hook Choir Member)", "Jon Batiste (Da Organist Tk Hazelton)", "Charles Anthony Bryant (Lil' Peace Of Heaven Baptist Church Of Red Hook Choir Member)", "Janinah Burnett (Lil' Peace Of Heaven Baptist Church Of Red Hook Choir Member)", "Courtney D.

Spike Lee does have a tendency to overuse music though in general.\r\n\r\nAnd some of the scenes (especially the preacher scenes) were too long for their own good.\r\n\r\nThe acting overall is solid especially Clarke Peters as the bishop shines, the kids weren't that amazing though (in particular the girl who played Chazz... 'Ooooooooooooooh!').\r\n\r\nOverall it's okay, far better than 'Da Sweet Blood of Jesus' and maybe even slightly better than 'ChiRaq' but it's still far from Spike Lee's work in his heydays we're talking about here.\r\n\r\n5.5/10... a weak 3/5."}], "recommandations_id": [262160, 22289, 26336, 49471], "youtube_key": "3k9PwH-CPP0"}
