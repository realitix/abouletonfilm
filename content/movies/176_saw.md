Now that I both date a horror\r\nfilm aficionado and my 13-year-old son himself is one as well, I have\r\ndecided to check out the contemporarily well-received original (I may\r\ndecide now to see the entire series, and in order, but really who's to\r\nsay?). Instantly, such trusted, bankable actors as Cary Elwes and Danny\r\nGlover give it credibility, just as Bette Davis and Joan Crawford gave\r\nsuch films as 'What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?' way back in days gone\r\nby. This was much better than I felt parts 3 and 5 were, by the way."}], "recommandations_id": [215, 214, 663, 11917]}
