The year is 1910 and the place is a small Japanese village. Goichi is suffering because he wants to go to school, but his family is too poor to afford that luxury. Even when a kind friend agrees to help out, Goichi's father refuses to give in to his son's request for an education. Instead, he sends Goichi off to work as an indentured servant for a cold-hearted merchant and his family. As tragedy strikes and the suffering of the young boy increases, he begins to look for some way out of his bleak situation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xdsgKP2LezYqJYnaU1E3QzeOdFL.jpg", "actors": ["Chikage Awashima ()", "Katsuo Nakamura ()", "Shuuichi Ikeda ()", "Kei Sat\u014d ()", "Yoshikazu Sugi ()", "Junkichi Orimoto ()", "Michiko Hoshi ()", "Masao Oda ()", "Nijiko Kiyokawa ()", "Shiro Okamoto ()", "Ry\u00f4 Suga ()", "Seihachi Uchikoshi ()", "Midori Yamamoto ()", "Sumie Kaneko ()", "Seiya Sat\u00f4 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
