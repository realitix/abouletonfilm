{"tmdb_id": 259435, "title": "Extramuros", "original_title": "Extramuros", "slug_title": "extramuros", "date": "1985-09-01", "genre": ["Drame / Romance"], "score": "5.0/10", "synopsis": "This 1985 Spanish film reveals one of the many terrible aspects of 16th century Spain, still plagued by the radical Christian Inquisition, one of a plethora of difficulties Spaniards faced at the time.  Spanish super star Carmen Maura plays a nun who agrees to a selfless scam, a fake stigmata, only to avoid separation from her lover, another nun.  It's a serious and passionate work, highlighting the theme of outspoken women-against-repression, seen in other good gay and lesbian films. This is not a lesbian \"Nun sense\" or another \"Dark Habits\" (by Almodovar, which also starred Carmen Maura, and also set in a Spanish convent, with some lesbian nuns).  Perhaps, best of all, 'Extramuros' is realistic and frank. It isn't shy about its characters' sexuality. Their sexuality, and the film as a whole are genuine.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cPxGyaokeCmvhwocyK9IVBmhDd3.jpg", "actors": ["Carmen Maura (Sor Ana)", "Mercedes Sampietro (Sor \u00c1ngela)", "Aurora Bautista (La Priora)", "Assumpta Serna (La Hu\u00e9speda)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
