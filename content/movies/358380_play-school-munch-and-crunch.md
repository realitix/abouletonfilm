We dress up as scarecrows, tell a Jack and the Beanstalk story with Humpty and Big Ted and make a corn husk doll. A rabbit comes to visit us and we look at a worm farm, as well as lots of your favourite songs to sing. Alex is the green grocer in the fruit and vegetable shop, and Jay buys some fruit and vegies to make a salad with dressing. Come and play with all your favourite toys and friends as they munch and crunch their way through the wonderful world of fruit and vegetables.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6kYrKEikS5HJLnTKpmtjcb1rY4b.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
