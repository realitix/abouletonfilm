The film focuses on the introduction of a massive museum of contemporary art in the same buildings that housed Sprague Electric Company in a typical New England mill town. Billed as an engine of economic development, the museum hasn't produced the jobs it promised and the city's downtown is semi-deserted. The film argues that national policy must change and that vibrant unions and social movements are needed to bring about a new 'New Deal' to deal with the social and economic crisis facing U.S. cities today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xLN140vR5NU8hGzxibViNsIgTXY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
