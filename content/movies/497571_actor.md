Literally living off his one recognizable moment in the TV cop show Boys in Blue (he played a TV stealing criminal), he spends his days hustling, his nights arguing with his live-in companion, a transvestite Christian rock wannabe. After a beer can robbery goes wrong, Bronze gets his songwriting pal an audition. When that falls through, he hits rock bottom. A bout with cellphone-induced ear cancer and an incident with a haphazardly thrown can of soup seals his sad fate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yzo6mj5er5PhK9fEwvW9VJcWXdi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
