The performance was a translation of Kafka\u2019s \"Ein Bericht f\u00fcr eine Akademie\". The resulting video work is about the giving of voice - its internal and external experience - the predictive moment before a word and short term memory after it - immediate past and near future mixing with the present/presence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zkr8GzvY1XSIqUiQWLTVJYJGNLA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
