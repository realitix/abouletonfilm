The poem has got just about everything - it is an action-packed adventure, a ghost story, a steamy romance, a morality tale and the world's first eco-poem.  Armitage follows in the footsteps of the poem's hero, Gawain, through some of Britain's most beautiful and mystical landscapes and reveals why an absurd tale of a knight beheading a green giant is as relevant and compelling today as when it was written.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eu0guJKq3estpfy3WmpguKiJ43S.jpg", "actors": ["Simon Armitage ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
