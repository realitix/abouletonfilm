While on the surface the village seems to be a peaceful parish, with perfect residents, soon it becomes apparent that something more sinister lurks beneath the fa\u00e7ade of a local businessman. On a wet, cold night, a mysterious girl visits the Reverend at the chapel. She is welcomed in warmly, but soon it becomes apparent that her visit is not for sanctuary but to deliver a message, a message in the form of a deep, bloody bite... Awoken with an unknown, uncontrollable thirst, the confused Reverend can't find any evidence of the girl from the night before. With nothing but his thirst and memory of the bite, the Reverend embarks on a mandate to clean up the village and the neighboring estate...by preaching or feasting.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fvHTo92gXvG36pvrQh6EvH0xfYg.jpg", "actors": ["Stuart Brennan (The Reverend)", "Rutger Hauer (The Withstander)", "Doug Bradley (Reverend Andrews)", "Emily Booth (Tracy)", "Giovanni Lombardo Radice (The Almighty)", "Tamer Hassan (Harold Hicks)", "Shane Richie (Prince)", "Marcia Do Vales (The Girl)", "Mads Koudal (Viking)", "Billy Rumbol (Ryan)", "Helen Griffin (Mrs. Jenkins)", "Dominic Burns (Big Bazza)", "Edmund Kingsley (Thug)", "Simon Phillips (The Detective)", "Dave Sommer (Brute)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [191094, 204456, 37776, 14472], "youtube_key": "quKSuOiu0uc"}
