There is a war going on between the Fundamentalists and the Liberal Muslims. This situation is creating a drift not only between the Western world and the Muslims, but also within the Muslims. The educated and modern Muslims are in a difficult situation because of their approach towards life and their western attire. They are criticized and harassed by the fundamentalists and on the other hand the Western world sees them as potential suspects of terrorism just because of their Muslim names.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cz9DHLSN7sMw0DeIQlnqWi9j5i4.jpg", "actors": ["Naseeruddin Shah (Maulana Wali)", "Fawad Afzal Khan (Sarmad)", "Shaan Shahid (Mansoor)", "Iman Ali (Maryam/Mary)", "Rasheed Naz (Maulana Tahiri)", "Hameed Sheikh (Sher Shah)", "Austin Marie Sayre (Janie)", "Simi Raheal (Mother of Mansoor & Sarmad)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [97603, 44827, 16566, 60730], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
