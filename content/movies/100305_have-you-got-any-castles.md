We begin with some musical numbers, notably the various pages of Green Pastures all joining in on a song, The Thin Man entering The White House Cookbook and exiting much fatter, and The House of Seven (Clark) Gables singing backup to Old King Cole. The Three Musketeers break loose, become Three Men on a Horse, grab the Seven Keys to Baldpate, and set the Prisoner of Zenda free. They are soon chased by horsemen from The Charge of the Light Brigade and Under Two Flags and beset by the cannons of All Quiet on the Western Front. All this disturbs the sleep of Rip Van Winkle, who opens Hurricane so that everyone is (all together now) Gone with the Wind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lFQnNidKZyUiNmmDPetSO9lqBR3.jpg", "actors": ["Mel Blanc (Town Crier / Praying Baby / Rip Van Winkle / Emily Host / Alladin)", "The Four Blackbirds (Vocal Group)", "Delos Jewkes (Old King Cole)", "Tedd Pierce (W.
