A top-flight cast brings a thoroughly modern perspective to the chaotic lives and tragic loves of the young Bohemians, while conductor Daniele Gatti draws out every detail of this endlessly inventive score, with luxurious playing from the Wiener Philharmoniker. \"Ms. Netrebko's Mim\u00ec emerged as thoroughly genuine and gorgeously sung. Mr. Beczala's Rodolfo was a perfect match\" (The New York Times).  ----- This description relates to IMDB id tt2315854 Salzburg 2012. Change the id to match, fill in missing details.
