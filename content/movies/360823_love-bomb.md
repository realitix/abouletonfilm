She finds her answer and her healing when she fuels herself with purpose by becoming a chiropractor with a passion for unconditional love and international service. 11 years later we join her on a 5-day chiropractic service trip to The Sacred Valley, Peru with her new boyfriend Austin and her friend Alejandra.  They are on a mission to serve as many people as possible offering healing, hope, and connection through collaboration with a medical clinic. Watch as the three stretch themselves by surrendering to service, affecting thousands that they touch, and ultimately, transforming as individuals through the power of love and teamwork. Love Bomb is interwoven with expert voices that explore themes of human transformation, love, altruism, and consciousness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wzMIxwlQlwLyOfbAB2eKUnGW0b9.jpg", "actors": ["Dr. Peter Amlinger (Himself)", "Kute Blackson (Himself)", "Gabrielle Bernstein (Himself)", "Elena Brower (Herself)", "Joseph Chilton Pearce (Himself)", "Sandra DelPrado (Herself)", "Guido DelPrado (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ageDeC0pKgY"}
