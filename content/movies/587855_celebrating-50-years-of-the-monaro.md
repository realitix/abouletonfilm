Other Monaro models that followed--in the 1960's and the new millennium--also enjoyed great success and helped create the Monaro legend.  Join us we reflect on some of the Monaro's greatest competition achievements, with special guest 1969 Hardie-Ferodo 500 winner Colin Bond. This special presentation features historic footage of its famous 1968 and 1969 Bathurst wins, Norm Beechey's 1970 ATCC triumph, the gruelling 1970 Ampol Trial, new millennium success in the Bathurst 24-Hour races and lots more, including some classic Monaro TV commercials.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gkpAJVBpFujaiDYXKLbN8l3s7yR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
