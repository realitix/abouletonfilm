The video was recorded at the Tavastia Club in Helsinki of the band's final show. This is also the band's last release. The DVD spent eight weeks at number 1 on Finland's DVD charts.  Hanoi Rocks' founders, vocalist Michael Monroe and guitarist Andy McCoy, had announced that they had taken the band as far as they could and that they would end the band with 8 live shows at the Tavastia Club. The band's original rhythm guitarist Nasty Suicide appeared as a special guest on this (last show) and the three previous shows.  Besides the show, the video also features an exclusive behind the scenes-documentary of the last week with Hanoi Rocks (co-filmed by some of the members of the band).  This DVD is also the only Hanoi Rocks release to feature drummer George Atlagic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dHBqIgmc9cZoqNt3K3lX3UWfQ0f.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Monroe (Vocals, Saxophone)", "Andy McCoy (Guitars)", "Conny Bloom ()", "Andy Christell ()", "George Atlagic ()", "Lacu Lahtinen ()", "Lacu Lahtinen ()", "Nasty Suicide ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
