This extraordinary production conducted by Lothar Zagrosek, and with Catherine Naglestad, Kate Ladner and Matthias Klink in the main roles, won the Bavarian Theatre Prize in 1999 and offers a refreshingly new view of one of the most frequently played operas worldwide. Special highlight: Neuenfels places an actor at every singer\u2019s side who not only takes over his role for the spoken original scripts, but also interacts with his singing double and other characters of the piece. In recent decades, directors have sought to revitalise the somewhat naive plot of the \u201cEntf\u00fchrung\u201d with fresh interpretations. Hans Neuenfels, who produced his \u201cfirst Mozart\u201d here in Stuttgart, retains the story\u2019s naivety and absurdity. He does this in a very stimulating and intelligent way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/70yVDmnxVJCp0HvXWBfmNayGBAy.jpg", "actors": ["Catherine Naglestad (Konstanze (singing voice))", "Matthias Klink (Belmonte (singing voice))", "Kate Ladner (Blonde (singing voice))", "Heinz G\u00f6hrig (Pedrillo (singing voice))", "Roland Bracht (Osmin (singing voice))", "Johannes Terne (Bassa Selim)", "Emanuela von Frankenberg (Konstanze)", "Carola Freiwald (Blonde)", "Alexander Bogner (Belmonte)", "Alexander Heidenreich (Pedrillo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
