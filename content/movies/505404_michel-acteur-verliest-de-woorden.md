The film shows how he deals with this loss of language and of the profession he practiced for more than 30 years. Against all odds Michel takes on one last role. His wife Irma Wijsman helps him to find new ways of expression and to stay focused. In their search, friends and colleagues draw close and talk about the unimaginable situation of no longer being able to grasp the words that elusively disappear. Showing the events in the first years after the diagnosis, the film makes clear how language defines our identity and what it means to redefine oneself. But foremost the film shows two powerful people who take control over a dramatic turn in their life. Acknowledging the sorrow with humor and undying love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xcS6pDSRDxJUy8Zw4QJ7Q90SVN2.jpg", "actors": ["Michel van Dousselaere ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "DzmUbEDX9R4"}
