Beginning as a black comedy, the film's mood transforms as the games played by Kaveh (director Mani Haghighi) and Leyla (Taraneh Alidoosti) become increasingly perverse, as they find inventive ways of humiliating the recipients of the cash. The immorality of the central characters is at times sickening, and their chain of lies is often as puzzling to us as they are to the townsfolk depicted onscreen. What is the relationship between the pair and why are they giving away money to the needy? Modest Reception has no easy answers nor pat resolutions - instead Haghighi takes the viewer on an intriguing ride into the dark recesses of the human spirit.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7hmgpMXXBDG3Map5HzOkS1MRpwz.jpg", "actors": ["Mani Haghighi (Kaveh)", "Taraneh Alidoosti (Leyla)", "Saber Abar ()", "Saeed Changizian ()", "Esmaeel Khalaj ()", "Mohammad Aghebati ()", "Danial Fathi ()", "Himan Dehgani ()", "Naqi Seif-Jamali ()", "Nader Fallah ()", "Vahid Aghapoor ()", "Ghorban Nadjafi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
