A vehement diatribe against pornography, the film attempts to link explicit portrayals of human sexuality to the subversion of American civilization, and briefly draws a parallel between pornography and the Communist conspiracy. The film is in the public domain, and it has become a popular download from the Prelinger Archives. Perversion for Profit illustrates its claims with still images taken from various soft core pornography magazines of the period, though with some portions of human anatomy obscured by colored rectangles.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zDeoCufJpeQz3WkOi1TmMiKwtsy.jpg", "actors": ["George Putnam (Himself)", "Damian O'Flynn (Judge)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
