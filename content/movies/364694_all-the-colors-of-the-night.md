The green horizon seems to distance it from the city in comfortable isolation. At nightfall, the place hosts known and unknown in a frantic party flow. Iris is the main attraction. But on a hungover morning, she finds a corpse in the living room. As in the distorted reflection of a crooked mirror, Iris feels repeating steps of her childhood friend, Tiara, a medical student who had run over a guy at the exit of a nightclub. After the incident, Tiara plunges into a spiral of self-pity, sentimental emptying and violence. The case is well known in town and Iris does not want to become another ghost in this dark repertoire of stories. In All the colors of the night, reality works as a dimension of imagination, memory and madness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4jZUrVqNk2OVR5u6yKEiFmeO7ba.jpg", "actors": ["Sabrina Greve ()", "Sandra Possani ()", "Brenda L\u00edgia ()", "Giovanna Sim\u00f5es ()", "R\u00f4mulo Braga ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
