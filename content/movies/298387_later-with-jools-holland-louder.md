Louder is combination of the most rock &amp; roll moments from Jools Holland's late night BBC2 show, which offers the only slot currently on terrestrial TV for New and experimental music. Due to this, Later... Louder offers the cream of the indie and rock crop over the last 10 years. Beginning with Dave Grohl in fine form with the Foo Fighters, we then switch to his mates Queens of the Stone Age belting out \"No One Knows\". More spot-the-connection fun follows, as the Screaming Trees' 1996 performance of \"All I Know\" sees a young Josh Homme on lead guitar. These connections run pretty much all the way through the disc, which adds an interesting slant on how to create a DVD track listing.\r With stand-out performances from the White Stripes, PJ Harvey and the Soundtrack of our Lives, Later... Louder also features the interviews from the original shows with such wide ranging talents as New Order and Courtney Love. This is a must for all those who are in need of a varied rock diet.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fOnSKeor5qiBMXjQlJI24SAMLsd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
