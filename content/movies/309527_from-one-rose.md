The film is an epic story in which the great events of the century -- women's suffrage, Prohibition, two World Wars, the Vanport Flood, the tumults of the '60s -- are experienced close-up, with the Rose Festival serving as an annual respite in the hard routines of life. From One Rose is a handsome and intelligent film that explores the intricate ways in which history affects communities and individuals at one and the same time.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
