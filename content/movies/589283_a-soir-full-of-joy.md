The film faithfully traced the course of this humorous and enterprising attempt to wake up the populace, filling out the basic plot with irreverent patriotic gags.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Marcel Roels (Arthur)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
