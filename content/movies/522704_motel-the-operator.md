When he is severely injured by strikebreakers, his wife, Esther, and infant son are left destitute. Desperate to save her starving child, Esther gives him up for adoption to a wealthy couple, and then commits suicide. The richly-rendered beautiful Yiddish songs by Sholem Secunda featuring Cantor Leibele Waldman and Joel Feig's famous choir are a good example of the bittersweet melodrama in the finest tradition of the Yiddish theater.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Chaim Tauber (Motel Friedman)", "Malvina Rappel (Esther Friedman)", "Maurice Kroner (Benjamin Rosenwald)", "Bertha Hart (Rebecca Rosenwald)", "Seymour Rechtzeit (Jack Rosenwald)", "Jacob Zanger (Joseph Frumkin)", "Yetta Zwerling (Chane Beile Frumkin)", "Gertrude Krause (Ruth Frumkin)", "Herman Rosen (Doctor)", "Izidor Frankel (Boss)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
