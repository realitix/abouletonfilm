Starting from different audio-visual perspectives, each section explores the existential space of the voice. Connecting the three performances are the central themes of the individual's body, listening to the other, and finding the right distance for multiple voices in a social space.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
