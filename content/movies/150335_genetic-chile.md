The Chile pepper defines New Mexican cuisine and is considered a sacred plant by many cultures. Despite overwhelming evidence of gene flow, persistent safety questions, predatory multinational agribusiness corporations and potential economic damage, the State of New Mexico funded research to produce a GMO chile. It was the first time a state government directly targeted a crop for genetic modification. Because the funding is public, we were able to force a rare interview with a genetic researcher at NMSU. This film is packed with information about the harmful use of GMO technology and the ignorance shown by the proponents of GMO crops.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Qwx5Xb8ypjAgsdDW7tumcurxmj.jpg", "actors": ["Isaura Andaluz (Herself)", "Christopher Dudley ((voice))", "Constance Falk (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
