Later in the film, he gives his drill sargeant a few pointers, right? Michael Christopher is an M.P. who catches a fellow recruit on AWOL. But the best scene is the opening, a new recruit is getting his hair buzzed off, and gives the barber a blowjob (an uncredited Al Parker - no face shot, just his cock through some camouflage pants!)The background sound is a mix of Marines \"sounding off\" and the buzz of the clippers, as of course the trademark Scott dry ice effect.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AhY9CiZwxuaJhhmaD6fXkXp1Rm1.jpg", "actors": ["Brian Thompson ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
