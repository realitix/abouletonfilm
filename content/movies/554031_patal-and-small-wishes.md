From inside the globe a singing figure emerges by the name of Patal, and has the ability to grant all the boy's wishes. He soon learns of the great power emanating from the globe and begins using it in everyday life, from saving a motorcyclist from crashing into their family car to solving his household chores. The magic never ceases to amaze and enrich the young boy's life in this charmingly quirky film.
