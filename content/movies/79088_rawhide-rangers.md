The villains are a group of frontier businessmen who set up a \"protective\" organization for the purpose of extorting money from the local ranchers. Enter hero Johnny Mack Brown, who has arrived in town to avenge the death of his brother. In short order, Brown deduces that the crooked businessmen were also responsible for his brother's murder, and then all heck breaks loose. Nell O'Day, one of the best horsewomen in Hollywood, is cast as the film's eminently self-reliant heroine.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/drH5gHjxhcaq7Hxuev5BMD7GiZ1.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Mack Brown (Brand Calhoun)", "Fuzzy Knight (Porky Blake)", "Kathryn Adams (Jo Ann Rawlings)", "Nell O'Day (Patti McDowell)", "Riley Hill (Steve Calhoun)", "Harry Cording (Blackie)", "Al Bridge (Rawlings)", "Frank Shannon (Ranger Captain McDowell)", "Ed Cassidy (Alec Martin)", "Bob Kortman (Henchman Dirk)", "Chester Gan (Sing Lo - the Cook)", "Jim Farley (Banker (as James Farley))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
