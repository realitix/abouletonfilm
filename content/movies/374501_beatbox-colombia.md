Their lyrics speak of daily life; civil war, street violence, corruption, drugs and the disappearance of close friends. Despite everything, they cling to hope and this they express through their music. The film is made in 8 mm and DVCAM and includes Flash Animations. Some of the footage is shot by the musicians themselves. The power of Latin American hip-hop street life confronts the horror of the Columbian war.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
