For Drew (Brad Hallowell), eking out a mundane life in Waterville, Maine, it is resisting the illicit pleasure in New York; for Mistress Datina (Philly), it means operating a sex and drug den to cope with her life. In his visually and sexually stimulating film, director Verow introduces multiple characters and overlapping narratives that portray the physical and emotional faces of addiction. For Rob (newcomer Rob Ordonez), drugs and sex are means of finding a bed to sleep in every night \u2013 while they provide Christian (Michael Vaccaro) a means of dealing with his helplessness and loss. A writer records these characters and their unforgettable stories. The themes are universal, but the possibilities are endless.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dvqqo0DT4bP6je0yClXyFjUHjrn.jpg", "actors": ["Theodore Bouloukos (Cherry)", "Brad Hallowell (Drew)", "Jon Moritsugu (Poppy)", "Gary Kramer (The Writer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
