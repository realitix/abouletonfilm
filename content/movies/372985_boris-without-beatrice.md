A freethinker, open-minded and proud, he also displays a certain arrogance when it comes to his successes. For some time now, his wife B\u00e9atrice, a Canadian government minister, has been bedridden, suffering from a mysterious depression. To escape from his wife\u2019s agony, Boris begins a relationship with a colleague, Helga, and gets close to Klara, a young woman who works as a maid in Boris\u2019s home. The sudden appearance of a stranger in his life forces Boris to come face-to-face with the world, with everything he takes for granted, with all his certainties.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n5tJdoRM7xBxWQPS14RiV5V5EZS.jpg", "actors": ["James Hyndman (Boris)", "Simone-Elise Girard (Beatrice)", "Denis Lavant (L'Inconnu)", "Isolda Dychauk (Klara)", "Dounia Sichov (Helga)", "Laetitia Isambert (Justine Malinovsky)", "Louise Laprade (Pauline Malinovsky)", "Anie Pascale (Docteur Miller)", "Roc LaFortune (Le maire)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [215745, 497931], "youtube_key": "gZlxwifrsFQ"}
