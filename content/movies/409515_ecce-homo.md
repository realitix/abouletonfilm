Her rather lonely existence is characterized by hard work and poverty and as her mother's condition worsens there doesn't seem to be a way out anymore. Ecce homo is a parable about being human, rich in religious symbolism, which dreamily and at the same time sombrely poses existential questions without volunteering answers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dts9qPjV390Nely9y3GtgRQeDId.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
