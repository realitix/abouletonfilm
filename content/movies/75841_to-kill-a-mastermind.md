Growing in number at an alarming rate, the Imperial Court orders Yang Chen-yu and his followers to wipe them out at all costs. Doing this proves difficult as no one knows the identity of the mastermind behind the Chi Sha, not even its own members. Spies infiltrate the organization in an effort to destroy them from within. But then, no one knows who the spies are and after a few ambushes and security breaches, the clan deputies begin suspecting one another of being traitors. With the Chi Sha dwindling in numbers, it's a matter of time before the mastermind must reveal himself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lPEjXuMeCRfqb6EGYIr2NckKZXA.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Wang Lung-Wei (Qisha Clan Leader)", "Dang Wai-Ho (8th Chief Fan Tao)", "Sek Gong (3rd Chief Liang Ying)", "Yuen Wah (2nd Chief Xi Zhao)", "Yuen Bun (4th Chief He Ming-Tian)", "Luo Sheng (7th Chief Lu Yi-Fei)", "Luo Jun (6th Chief Liang Jie)", "Mang Ding-Goh (5th Chief Xuan Jia-Bao)", "Ku Feng (Mr. Zhou Dong-Lu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
