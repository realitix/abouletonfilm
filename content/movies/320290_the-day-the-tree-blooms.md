Set in a more old-fashioned time, the story centers around Lenka (Suzana Fisarskova), a young woman with a domineering, psychologically abusive father. When Lenka falls in love she suffers the ultimate injustice when her father and her family forbid her to marry the man. They see no advantage in such a union and want her to marry a wealthy local landowner instead, for obvious reasons. But Lenka is not as submissive as they think and she runs away to the city to look for the man she loves -- only to find a serious problem, though a surmountable one, is waiting for her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uhsSGDtjLWHnqOkz4NDs2jDjqC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
