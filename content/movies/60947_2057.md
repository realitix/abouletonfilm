In a unique blend of drama and science, this three-part series shows you the world of tomorrow. Will we have flying cars? Will advances in medicine help us stay young forever? What about \"printing\" custom-made vital organs? What will our cities look like? What will tomorrow's wars be about? Will we have robots helping around the house? Will solar power be the new oil?  Supported by the world's leading scientists and research institutes, we embark on a quest to answer some of society's most fundamental questions and reveal the dramas of tomorrow's world along the way. State-of-the-art computer graphics in combination with a dynamic story line will create a world usually only seen in feature films, but with the accuracy and relevance of a documentary. This series is all about opening the window of our future based on science fact, not science fiction.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kahtIV6Tr6P6FJXv5LrMiz8MvxF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
