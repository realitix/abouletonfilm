Within this eight-second loop, [Rimmer] cuts shorter ones. For example, the activity of a central group of three women is cut so that the figures repeat certain motions over and over and over again... Rimmer also chose to use the forms of surface imperfections, the scratches and dirt patterns, as bases for his loops... Although working in a disciplined style of re-structuring cinematic forms, his highly orchestrated creations have inspired great admiration both from cineastes and the more general public.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2wit6CbUuA291ICZcsRhcgIsgRz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
