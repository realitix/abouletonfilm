Mugabe was damned as a terrorist, then knighted by Queen Elizabeth, and is still in power more than 30 years later. The film explores what happened through interviews with some of his closest comrades. It assembles a unique collection of southern African archive to powerfully evoke each of the decades of Mugabe's reign. This is a complex and compelling view of Zimbabwe the country and Mugabe the man.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gNeKZ9sZIzxBKeAFUtwQgtsSH4o.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
