It charts the rise and fall of a femme fatale \"created to make trouble\", from life as a society hostess to prostitution and eventual bloody death at the hands of Jack the Ripper. Berg's score is intensely beautiful, and the rich characterisation brilliantly executed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tCJorYY36v1co2gyl7mgaTrB292.jpg", "actors": ["Christine Sch\u00e4fer (Lulu)", "Kathryn Harries (Gr\u00e4fin Geschwitz)", "Norman Bailey (Schigolch)", "Patricia Bardon (Wardrobe Mistress, Groom, Schoolboy)", "Stephan Drakulich (Painter, Negro)", "Neil Jenkins (Prince, Manservant, Marquis)", "David Kuebler (Alwa)", "Donald Maxwell (Animal Trainer, Athlete)", "Wolfgang Sch\u00f6ne (Dr. Sch\u00f6n, Jack the Ripper)", "Jonathan Veira (Stage Manager, Banker, Medical Specialist, Professor)", "Colette Delahunt (15-Year-Old Girl)", "Christine Rice (Her Mother)", "Carole Wilson (Designer)", "Darrell Babidge (Journalist)", "Richard Mosley-Evans (Servant)", "Michael Kennerley (Police Commissioner, Clown)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
