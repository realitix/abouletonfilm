He is also the man whose life and work inspired one of the cult movies of the sixties, Michelangelo Antonioni's Blow-Up, and who has constantly travelled the globe either with the most beautiful models or chronicling the contemporary reality of Papua New Guinea, Brazil, Vietnam, Afghanistan and other countries with ground-breaking reportages. Above all, Bailey is a romantic with a delightful sense of humour approaching his 73rd year and showing no sign of slowing up. Director J\u00e9r\u00f4me de Missolz has created an engaging portrait of this very private man who bared the soul of the swinging sixties and seventies with his photographs and films.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lg5RwKF1KU2CMixfQSvsRQ5fh7W.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
