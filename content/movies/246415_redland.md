Although there are lingering nature shots, it's far more similar (visually) to **Tarkovsky** or **Lopushansky** than **Malick**. A very basic human story about family, survival and jealousy. An incredibly solid debut, and a bar set high for independent filmmakers looking to have their voice heard."}], "recommandations_id": []}
