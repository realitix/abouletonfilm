Through this discovery process information is uncovered about the lack of \"real\" science behind what is accepted as official science. We are given the opportunity to witness and view respected authorities who come forward to challenge many of the uncertainties and \"truths\" about AIDS. This documentary will challenge those who claim to have discovered the cause of AIDS and who then sold to the world a highly inconsistent test as the absolute indicator of a fatal disease. A timeline through AIDS history presents inaccurate statements, questionable scientific evidence, and no real answers from the billions of global dollars spent on research.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dKK4Hcb01agYgKPtfj2tyH1TLBV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
