What the film emphasizes is the surrealistic drama of symbolic self-destruction that Kren drew out of Brus\u2019 action, pacing out each gesture so that one gets a tense, iconoclastic revelation of a man covered in white plaster lying surrounded by razor blades and a range of instruments looking as if they have been taken from an operating theatre. The blades, scissors and scalpels are gradually inserted into him in a ritualistic self-operation.
