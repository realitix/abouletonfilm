When the wife demands a \"star child\" and Charlie can't deliver the goods, they turn to their crazy neighbor (Calvin) to get the job done, so to speak. Very hilarious and bawdy comedy where \"one rooster to a hen-house\" is not always the truth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wEZtwunqR6RjTMuz9CVBMar53ux.jpg", "actors": ["Jeff Conaway (Charlie Alderson)", "Tanya Roberts (Linda Alderson)", "John Calvin (Gordon \"Rip\" Mallory)", "Joan Severance (Maureen Mallory)", "Dom DeLuise (Dr. Beckhard)", "Christopher Michael Moore (\"Cousin Ray\" Burns)", "Angelo Tiffe (Frank Daniello)", "Bruce Lurie (Guru)", "Steve Adell (Muscle Man)", "Lezlie Deane (Party Girl)", "Lisa Comshaw (Body Double)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [20493, 18223, 25120], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
