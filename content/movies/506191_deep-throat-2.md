She is the daughter to the deceased Lilly Laru. It is explained that the original Deep Throat was based loosely upon Lilly Laru\u2019s life. Laura Liplock is married to Senator Lawrence Liplock. The Senator and his darling wife serve on a committee whose main goal is to rid pornography. Laura is re-visited by her mother while the committee screens Deep Throat, and she more or less becomes possessed by her mother\u2019s spirit. The movie goes on to show the characters becoming sexually deviant and overall changing their outlook on pornography.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pobi3KPkYB42jXpChGjHUGf8gbL.jpg", "actors": ["Krista Lane ()", "Samantha Strong ()", "Sheena Horne ()", "Tasha Voux ()", "Scarlett Fever ()", "Melissa Melendez ()", "Alexis Firestone ()", "Ron Jeremy ()", "Michael Knight ()", "Jamie Gillis ()", "David Morris ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
