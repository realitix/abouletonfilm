William Haines, two years removed from being Tinseltown\u2019s top male star, plays Grimes in a melodrama noted for its glimpses of live radio production and for a Depression-era ethos that includes peroxide cuties eager to land a job, a sugar daddy or both.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/spoE22CdvTZDJ0QPRr0tKmUv3Ej.jpg", "actors": ["William Haines (Bill Grimes)", "Madge Evans (Laura O'Neil)", "Anita Page (Larry Barnes)", "Karen Morley (Alice Grimes)", "Neil Hamilton (Jack Clayton)", "Wallace Ford (Larry Barnes)", "Jean Hersholt (George Wagner)", "John Miljan (Ted Russell)", "Hank Mann (Radio station sound effects man)", "Murray Kinnell (Mr. Carson)", "Ethel Griffies (Mrs. Peters)", "Charley Grapewin (Pierce)", "Lucien Littlefield (Fred)", "Hattie McDaniel (Performer entering radio station)", "Joan Marsh (Honey O'Neil)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
