The film does not tell a story, but is made up of various scenes put together as a collage with scenes set in different locations. The futility of human activity and the search for love make up the film's central theme set against the strains of a Silician funeral march. Filmed on location in Wuppertal, Germany, between October 1987 and April 1989.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1qOJddR3Li9OcvlNqEYJtsHITbn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
