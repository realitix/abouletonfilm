Mark Cousins's bold documentary looks at death in the atomic age, but life too. Using only archive film and a new musical score by the band Mogwai, the film shows us an impressionistic kaleidoscope of our nuclear times - protest marches, Cold War sabre-rattling, Chernobyl and Fukishima - but also the sublime beauty of the atomic world, and how x-rays and MRI scans have improved human lives. The nuclear age has been a nightmare, but dreamlike too.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p6dIn4vPAButOuAlnR7mz95D3GB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
