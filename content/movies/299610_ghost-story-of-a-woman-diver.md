The ghost's main target however is the village kingpin, and employer of the local diving girls, Satomura (played by Juzaburo Akechi). When his wife and youngest daughter are abducted, it is up to his remaining daughter Nami (Banri) and her ama companions to get to the bottom of the mystery, which again revolves around sunken treasure and a gang of swarthy crooks.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bjGsziSl9inI64w1j7T9ytBm1bm.jpg", "actors": ["J\u00fbzabur\u00f4 Akechi (Detective Takashi Ikeda)", "Katsuko Wakasugi (Teruyo Satomura)", "Ky\u00f4ko Yashiro (Kayoko Miyauchi)", "Masayo Banri (Natsue Satomura)", "Shinsuke Mikimoto ()", "Ky\u00f4ji Kokonoe ()", "Masaru Kodaka ()", "Rei Ishikawa ()", "Hiroaki Kurahashi ()", "Sakutar\u014d Yamakawa ()", "Tomohiko \u00d4tani ()", "Sabur\u00f4 Sawai ()", "Akiko Yamashita ()", "Ky\u00f4ko \u00d4gimachi ()", "Reiko Akiyama ()", "Akiko Kujo ()", "Takamitsu Watanabe ()", "Tetsuya Chiba ()", "Kaoru Katsumata ()", "Kazuki Nishi ()", "Shinji Suzuki ()", "Baku Mizuhara ()", "Kiyoko Tsuji ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
