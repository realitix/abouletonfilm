It took place on Thanksgiving Eve, November 24, 1993 at the Boston Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. The buildup to the pay-per-view consisted of feuds scripted by the WWF's writers, and the matches that took place at the event had pre-determined outcomes that had been decided by the promotion. The event has been criticized by several reviewers, who have pointed to Jerry Lawler and Doink the Clown not appearing and a dull main event as problems that hurt the show.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qxXE8K6HE9WJH18dd00eIBTK6Nu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
