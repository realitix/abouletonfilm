SOSUEME is an unabashed homage to the athletes' graceful, curved movements and the seamless interaction of body and board. Set to a Giacomo Puccini opera enhanced with a spoken-word track by Malcolm McLaren, the film provides unceasing pleasure as a hypnotic escape or an aesthetic tour de force. The joke in the title is explained at the outset by an onscreen confession: \"The filmmaker acknowledges the completely unauthorized and illegal use of sound and image in this film.\" - Michael Fox", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/442ehbREOEV7JXkpG4TXeXvyJI9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
