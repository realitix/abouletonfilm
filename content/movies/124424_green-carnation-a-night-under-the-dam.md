This live recording was made several kilometers into the Norwegian mountains, under a thirty-meter-tall dam built in 1939, hence the name.  The band performed its entire The Acoustic Verses album and other material in front of an audience of more than five hundred. Green Carnation was supported by several guests, including the Kristiansand String Quartet, singer Anne Marie Almedal, former keyboardist Bernt Moen and violinist Leif A. Wiese.  The DVD contains the entire live show, including two bonus songs, a photo gallery containing more than one-hundred-seventy images, a behind-the-scenes video and full 5.1 Surround Sound.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8B6tXyvxqd1VgWmFB9YrbLHlLGB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
