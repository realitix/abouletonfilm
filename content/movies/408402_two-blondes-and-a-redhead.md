When the show closes, she brings two of her chorus friends, Patti Calhoun (June Preisser) and Vicki Adams ('Judy Clark'), home with her. In addition to trying to make her friends acceptable to the snooty society of which her family is part, she is also being blackmailed by a rival. She and her two friends win over the blue-bloods with a couple of chorus routines, and she discloses she will be marrying the butler, Tommy Randell (Jimmy Lloyd), rather than the pompous Freddie Ainsley (Rick Vallin).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uJql8dksIa7dMu47b0QoJ2vQBmx.jpg", "actors": ["Jean Porter (Catherine Abbott)", "Jimmy Lloyd (Tommy Randell)", "June Preisser (Patti Calhoun)", "Judy Clark (Vicki Adams)", "Rick Vallin (Freddie Ainsley)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
