Alexei Lyarsky plays the young Maxim, who grows up under the czarist regime with his grandparents as guardians. Continually demeaned by his martinet grandfather, Maxim is drawn to his warm-hearted grandmother (Varvara Massalitinova), who instills in him the willingness to pursue his writing muse. Gorky's (and Donski's) deep abiding love for Russia is conveyed through the film's remarkably romanticist landscape shots along the Volga River, which cry out for Technicolor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mdpau6dOpQ2JNVkGKjgXgXoXvgY.jpg", "actors": ["Aleksei Lyarsky (Aleksei Peshkov (as Alyosha Lyarsky))", "Varvara Massalitinova (Akulina Ivanva Kashirin)", "Mikhail Troyanovsky (Vasili Vasilyevich Kashirin)", "Yelizaveta Alekseyeva (Varvara Kashirina Peshkova)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [149349, 94225, 71576, 48596], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
