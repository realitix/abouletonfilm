Valie Export's notion of \"body language\" poses an ironic relation to these questions that acknowledges \"the end of the body\" or at least the final break with the way in which we understand it to be a biological, existential, or metaphysical entity. Export has broken away from any notion of unity - either body, space, or time - into the fragmented world of doubling and difference that is caught in representation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zPBxat1YYeOT69oeeQzCDozbUZb.jpg", "actors": ["Irmilin Hofer ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
