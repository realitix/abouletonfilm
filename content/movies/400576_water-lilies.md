She is a celebrated dancer whose fame is widespread. She has overtaxed her strength, is forbidden to appear in public and is obliged to seek quiet and rest. She retires to her Aunt Mary's home, a beautiful and restful country place, where she secures the much-needed seclusion and comfort. Next door to Aunt Mary there lives a very handsome fellow who has often admired Aunt Mary's niece and to tell the truth she admires him. Growing restless under the enforced retirement, Albertina strolls down to the lake where the water-lilies grow. She pulls a number of them into a garland which she holds bewitchingly above her head. They give her an inspiration and involuntarily she pirouettes, bends and swerves her lithe and willowy form like a nymph of ethereal sweetness. The young man who lives next door is rowing upon the lake; he see Albertina dancing on the velvety field of grass, is charmed by her, and rushes toward her.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Irmgard von Rottenthal (Albertina)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
