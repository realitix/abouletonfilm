This adventurous collage also features the filmmaker's own diaristic recollections (notably of being fitted for a diaphragm by a cold, intimidating doctor), poetical staged sequences, other women's audio testimonies, an old classroom instructional reel about menstruation, prose by Gertrude Stein and feminine \"ideals\" like the undulating young woman performing in fish-tail costumes at Florida's kitschy Weeki-Wachee Springs \"Underwater Mermaid Theater.\" - Dennis Harvey", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rglf5XJT0TwSqXyGK8nnQN8232m.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
