The game creates an alternate universe, where players challenge each other with a mythically-charged online world of humans, orcs, the undead, knights, and elves. In Beyond the Game, we meet - in real life and within the game - two of the game's leading figures, known as Grubby and Sky. Acclaimed filmmaker Jos de Putter tracks these Kasparovs of a new generation and a new game across the world all the way to the world championships in Seattle. A fascinating, surprising, and genuinely touching portrait, Beyond the Game is a study of, and participation in, the reformation of our communities in the internet age.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/otyyMIzgXCD4f7hPLBTFfOuwmwz.jpg", "actors": ["Li Xiaofeng (Himself)", "Fredrik Johansson (Himself)", "Manuel Schenkhuizen (Himself)", "Jang Jae-Ho (Himself)", "Yoan Merlo (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "BKqgHaT9Xd8"}
