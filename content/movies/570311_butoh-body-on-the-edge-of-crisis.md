A Dionysian dance of nudity, eroticism, and sexuality, Butoh's scale of expression ranges from meditative tenderness to excessive grotesqueness. By reestablishing the ancient Japanese connection of dance, music, and masks, and by recalling the Buddhist death dances of rural Japan, Butoh incorporates much traditional theater. At the same time, it is a movement of resistance against the abandonment of traditional culture to a highly organized consumer-oriented society.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/swu2gTEi5gwHQQDbwIrRdeIE39Z.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
