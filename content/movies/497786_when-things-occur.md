The film probes the face of mourning and grief \u2013 its digital embodiment, transmission, and representation. It asks how the gaze gets channeled within the digital realm, and how empathy travels. Equally, how the documentary signifier \u2013 and its abstraction \u2013 operate when viewing suffering. What exactly is viewing suffering \u2018at a distance\u2019 \u2013 and how many meters or kilometers is that? What is the behavior and political economy of the image of war? Who is the \u2018local\u2019 in the representation of war?
