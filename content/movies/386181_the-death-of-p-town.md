The film was never completed due to a violent argument between actor Jack Smith and director Ken Jacobs shortly after the shooting began. Jacobs edited together what footage he had into this silent short. A title card explains that Smith 'would've starred as the Fairy Vampire.'  Unfortunately the actual content neither shows a vampire nor (necessarily) that the character is gay.
