On the first day of class, he meets two of his new schoolmates: Email, a big boy who wears his karate suit under his smock and is the son of a motel owner, and Guzm\u00e1n, an olive-skinned kid who's been living with his grandmother since his parents ran away. The three kids chat while others sing the national anthem, and come to the conclusion that all the teachers could die at that exact moment and it wouldn't change much: right after they say it, the music teacher falls as if she were struck by lightning. Not without some sense of guilt, they spend the following days (without classes due to mourning, of course) living among hostility and lack of understanding from the grown-ups, walking and talking through the vineyards under Mendoza's eternal sun -which also seems to fill this tale of initiation and friendship with warmth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vZJgxswebmOK27Ae0Wbuh25loRb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
