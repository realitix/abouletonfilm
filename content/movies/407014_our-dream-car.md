Yi Wen's script is full of lively and humorous details, his direction affectionate, while the young stars are charming. The film also paints a picture of a bourgeois lifestyle that was yet to occur in the ex-colony. It has also been aptly compared to the genre of hollywood \"bedroom\" comedy made famous by Rock Hudson and Doris Day in the 1950s.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lfymjhxfSQV7AX2eMTgk7tCkRM6.jpg", "actors": ["Grace Chang (Li Jiaying)", "Chang Yang (Zhang Daming)", "Gam Tin-Chue (Party guest)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
