The atmospheric venue, steeped in rock history, gave fans a brilliant opportunity to see the band up close as they delivered a set packed with more recent solo tracks, including several from the new album, and classics from Slash's earlier career with Guns 'n' Roses and Velvet Revolver. The intimate setting inspired the band to deliver a scintillating, dynamic performance that is brilliantly captured on this DVD.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/75RdiAhn30MeVZ8zwaojnH03Le8.jpg", "actors": ["Slash (Guitars)", "Myles Kennedy (Vocals)", "Todd Kerns (Bass)", "Brent Fitz (Drums)", "Frank Sidoris (Guitars)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "eQOT-YUB9Es"}
