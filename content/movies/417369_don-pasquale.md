The sensational Alfredo Kraus sings her beloved Ernesto. H\u00e5kan Hageg\u00e5rd, in his Met debut role and season, is Dr. Malatesta, the man who helps the young couple trick the crusty old bachelor of the title (Gabriel Bacquier at his comical best) into a fake marriage. This being a Donizetti comedy, it all turns out perfectly well at the end\u2014and getting there is pure operatic fun.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iDwSBQAjWbng7lC4iOZolR6TFRa.jpg", "actors": ["Gabriel Bacquier (Don Pasquale)", "Beverly Sills (Norina)", "Alfredo Kraus (Ernesto)", "H\u00e5kan Hageg\u00e5rd (Dr. Malatesta)", "Nico Castel (Notary)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
