The deceased partner was in his lifetime as mean and miserly as Scrooge is now and he warns him to change his ways or face the consequences in the afterlife. Scrooge dismisses the apparition but the first of the three ghosts, the Ghost of Christmas Past, visits as promised. Scrooge sees those events in his past life, both happy and sad, that forged his character. The second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, shows him how many currently celebrate Christmas. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come shows him how he will be remembered once he is gone. To his delight, the spirits complete their visits in one night giving him the opportunity to mend his ways.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/84fcG1pezqwIgJTmKe3OSMyRUTJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "GFCpaSAYpHM"}
