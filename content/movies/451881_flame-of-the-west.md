Usually seen in villainous roles, Dumbrille herein offers a sincere, effective performance as a scrupulously honest US marshal named Nightlander. When he takes on a gang of crooked gamblers, Nightlander is shot down in cold blood, compelling frontier doctor John Poole (Johnny Mack Brown) to put his Hippocratic oath on the back burner and strap on the shootin' irons.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4X7dA4anCk6daf5JKWzvy5qAVxv.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Mack Brown (Dr. John Poore)", "Raymond Hatton (Add Youman)", "Joan Woodbury (Poppy Rand)", "Douglass Dumbrille (Marshal Tom Nightlander)", "Lynne Carver (Abbie Compton)", "Tom Quinn (Bartender Ed)", "Harry Woods (Wisdon (as Harry Lewis Woods))", "Ray Bennett (Henchman Rocky (as Raphael Bennett))", "Riley Hill (Cowhand Midland)", "Jack Ingram (Henchman Slick)", "John Merton (Carl Compton)", "Jack Rockwell (Rancher Bill Knott)", "Steve Clark (Rancher Hendricks)", "Pee Wee King (Band Leader Pee Wee)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
