A young man with a past begins work in a factory, where he attracts the amorous attention of a mysterious woman who lurks behind the scenes. He is a relatively unique young man, perhaps a genetic one-off, in that he feels no particular attraction to Tomie. This of course intrigues Tomie, and she begins to become obsessed with him. Soon, he is caught in a vicious struggle between two rival Tomies. And neither Tomie will die.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fbDkl1tpkF2ThS4ccH4Mu82evWD.jpg", "actors": ["Y\u00fb Abiru (Tomie Kawakami)", "Chika Arakawa (Young Tomie)", "Emiko Matsuoka (Tomie Kawakami)", "Masaki Miura ()", "Hidekazu Nagae ()", "Daikichi Sugawara ()", "Yuki Takenaka ()", "Kazur\u00f4 Tsuji ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [52407, 52404, 46313, 52408], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
