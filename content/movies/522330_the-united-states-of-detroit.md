I had this strong image of being young and hearing that song, \u2018This land is your land, this land is my land,\u2019- thinking about inter-connectivity between communities facing similar issues. This film doesn\u2019t scream with a rigid motif, but leaves the viewer feeling positive about community and individuals are able to accomplish. Things happening in Detroit are applicable to over 300 postindustrial cities- this film serves as a way to get people brainstorming to solve world problems, starting with themselves.\u201d \u2014Tylor Norwood, Director", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aDGIDfjbID73jiVHR3QwGPNgTCd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
