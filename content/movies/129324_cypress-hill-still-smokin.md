Following a brace of songs recorded live at San Francisco's Fillmore Theatre, this selection settles into a tried and tested promo formula for half of its running time, using ghetto-real grainy footage of the moody trio stalking inner city streets. \"When the Ship goes Down\" branches out into conceptual territory with a three-minute epic concerning internecine gang warfare that breaks up the band's performance. On \"Dr Greenthumb\" they play on their Furry Freak Brothers of rap stereotype in the setting of a green-fingered General Hospital. \"(Rock) Superstar\" sees a Cypress fan winning a Willy Wonka-style ride through their Hall of Mirrors, where he is transformed into a bona fide, gold lame-wearing rock star. Set in a derelict warehouse, the hardcore romp of \"Can't Get the Best of Me\" is reminiscent of Fight Club's basement brawls.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rmDbaZcENEtzeFlzYCuwbjNDlcj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
