A static camera depicts images of a pipe, clock, and smoke against a whitewashed brick wall. The superimposed titles were added in 1971, and include the labels \u2018Figure I\u2019 and \u2018Figure II\u2019, phrases that recur throughout Broodthaers oeuvre, and echo Magritte\u2019s concern with the relationship between object, image and language.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5xx1ALv91dF2crUO0xJLKUfWyZH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
