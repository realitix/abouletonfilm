The financial urgency of everyday life is permeated by the political situation in Congo: a larger, more abstract urgency, which the diaspora experiences from a distance. The film finds itself somewhere in between these two imperatives, between here and somewhere else, the past and the present, small money and big money.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lYEqN1hnb2kNZSAIJqcO98gmDcO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
