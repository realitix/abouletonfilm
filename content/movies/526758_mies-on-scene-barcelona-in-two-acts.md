It only existed for eight months but paradoxically its image was always alive in the minds of generations of architects around the world, becoming one of his greatest influences.  The Pavilion is still surrounded by myths and mysteries that this documentary addresses, framing the building into a portrait in two acts of the Barcelona that made possible its cons-truction in 1929 and its reconstruction in 1986. We immerse ourselves in a reflection on the transformative capacity of art, the emotional perception of space and the concept of master-piece.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aOJt0rKV5XqVTWf0EfI8QzrMJ6o.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
