He assists \u201cPrince\u201d Mikah (Simon MacCorkindale) and his cute sister (Kathleen Beller) to overthrow the evil king (Richard Lynch) and his former evil sorcerer (Richard Moll).\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Sword and the Sorcerer\u201d debuted two weeks before \u201cConan the Barbarian\u201d in the spring of 1982 and it\u2019s just a second-rate S&S adventure by comparison. It\u2019s heroic fantasy with the tone of Star Wars, but without the blockbuster budget and in-depth characters. In light of the somewhat kiddie vibe I was surprised by the female top-nudity. \u201cConan\u201d was heroic fantasy as well, but it lacked the Star Wars air, had more interesting characters, a compelling story and a mind-blowing score by Basil Poledouris. I\u2019m surprised that BOTH movies raked in roughly the same amount domestically at the box office, almost $40 million.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the story, the set-up in the first act is too convoluted to create any drive, although the opening on Tomb Island where the hideous Xusia is resurrected in the bowels of the earth is well done. Horsley is gallant and Beller is adorable, but the characters are paper thin. At just over an hour and a half, the tortuous story has no time to breathe and therefore fails to flesh-out the heroes or villains, like \u201cConan\u201d did. That said, some of the characters are kinda memorable, like the spirited black warrior (whom I can\u2019t discern from the cast list). While there are worthwhile bits throughout this movie they don\u2019t amount to a quality S&S picture. \u201cThe Sword and the Sorcerer\u201d is decidedly bush league.\r\n\r\nThe end credits claim that the sequel is \u201ccoming soon.\u201d Actually, it didn\u2019t surface until 28 years later under the title \u201cAbelar: Tales of an Ancient Empire\u201d (2010).\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 39 minutes and was shot in Southern Cal (Griffith Park, Los Angeles; Culver City; and Riverside).\r\n\r\nGRADE: C/C-"}], "recommandations_id": [46500, 47360, 28218, 47364]}
