The film can be thought of as a metaphor for the representational process and the cinematic \u2018apparatus\u2019 itself, with the \u2018bridging process\u2019 connecting the \u2018real\u2019 bridge with its representation as a reflected image on water surface, the reflected image on water to camera and film emulsion, the projected film image to the screen and the screen to the film viewer in the cinema. To push this still a stage further, it acts as a metaphoric link between theory and practice (a stills sequence from Bridge appeared on the first page of the first edition of Undercut Magazine).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4jRFquPZHSRILqIh7y2ynZrm9Ug.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
