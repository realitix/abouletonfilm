His girlfriend is a free-spirited and wealthy European lass who runs an antique shop. One day, Driss becomes fascinated with Fouad, an old man who runs a rundown caf\u00e9 by the beach. Fouad disdains his fellow Moroccans, calling them lazy, preferring the company of Europeans -- particularly, as Driss later learns -- young European women. Always on the make, Driss offers Fouad a business proposition -- to revamp his establishment and turn it into a proper restaurant with Driss as his business partner. He is later shocked and hurt to learn that Fouad starts to remodel his business but without Driss. Sending out his friends as spies, Driss learns a number of unsettling things about his would-be associate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6tPMbCOs4qg1f2VlTFmkPr9wl3u.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
