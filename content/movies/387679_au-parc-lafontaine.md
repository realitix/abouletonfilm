Set to an original song, the film follows a mother who brings her son to the park, where he plays, swings, and watches the ducks and gondolas glide on the pond. As an adult, he wanders through the park with his sweetheart. The song closes sadly, for his sweetheart leaves him. The passing gondola seems to bear his love away forever, but the final scenes suggest a happy ending. - NFB", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8Of0XSOutKgHEQEvYtulpSEV4oU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
