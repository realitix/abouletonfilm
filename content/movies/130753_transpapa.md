Aside from all the boys thinking she\u2019s frigid, her recently love-struck mother is driving her round the twist. But she also has a father who she hasn\u2019t seen for years. When Maren decides to get in touch with him, her mother finally spills the beans: He now goes by the name of Sophia and lives as a woman \u2013 just what she needs! Irrespective of her vexation, Maren risks a meeting and finds in Sophia a person just as hormonal and puerile as herself \u2013 a person who would actually prefer to be her best friend, at best even her mother. Can Maren accept that this life makes her father happy? TRANSPAPA is a compassionate and funny story of gender role-breaking, tolerance and the search for identity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wrjwY0wPkajLZaXRDhPBe3DtRjN.jpg", "actors": ["Luisa Sappelt (Maren)", "Devid Striesow (Sophia)", "Sandra Borgmann (Ulrike)", "Horst Sachtleben (Wolfgang)", "Florence Kasumba (Tessi)", "Fritzi Haberlandt (Silke)", "Arno Kempf (Volker)", "Henriette Nagel (Zora)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
