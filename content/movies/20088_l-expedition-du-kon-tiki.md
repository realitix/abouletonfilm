The purpose of the expedition was to prove Heyerdal's theory that the Polynesian Islands were populated from the east---specifically Peru---rather than from the west (Asia) as had been the theory for hundreds of years. Heyerdahl made a study of the winds and tides in the Pacific, and by simulating conditions as closely as possible to those he theorized the Peruvians encountered, set out on the voyage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/miZKTcEMzmlrIsKxKdUNJlH3vRm.jpg", "actors": ["Thor Heyerdahl (Himself)", "Herman Watzinger (Himself)", "Erik Hesselberg (Himself)", "Knut Haugland (Himself)", "Torstein Raaby (Himself)", "Bengt Danielsson (Himself)", "Ben Grauer (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [87078, 280586, 29860, 105773], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
