While all three characters are too reticent to unleash their feelings, the romance turns on the realization that this web of emotions is largely symbolic. Nham represents for Quyen an innocence and a past that she can\u2019t recapture, just as she represents for Nham an urbanity and future prospects that he may never attain; and caught between the two is the delicate Ngu, left in the most desolate postion of positions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mKNwaVEhTJx0cgYSqXzIAmz8Xwr.jpg", "actors": ["L\u00ea V\u00e2n (Quyen)", "Ngoc Bao Ta (Nham)", "Huong Thuy (Ngu)", "Tr\u1ecbnh Th\u1ecbnh (Grandfather Giao Quy)", "Tat Binh (Ten Co Moi)", "Bich Ngoc (Thim Nhung)", "Ngoc Thoa (Me Nham)", "Phan Trong (Lai Xe Tai)", "Tang Vu (Ong Buu Dien)", "Yen Hoang (Vo Giao Quy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
