It concentrates on less than a minute of horrifying footage of the bloody killing of people who were unaware of the official curfew, to find out more of the identity of the victims. 'Into Thin Air' can be seen as the moving and pathetic image-reading of any political massacre of innocent victims.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Rt8VliX4qS7PCag5hzzwDVUsro.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
