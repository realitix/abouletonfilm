She has many suitors, including a simple-minded farmer's son who plans to drag her away. Even her own brother Ngor is in love with her. However she is in love with Fara, a poor student who has returned to the village, while the university is on strike. At birth, she had been promised in marriage to Diogoye, who went away to work in France. Diogoye, who supplied her parents with many things over the years, has now sent a dowry, and asked that she be married to him in the village in his absence; she would then be sent to France.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nvewlPOhiFGJ1P4LqXQJ0jnXKul.jpg", "actors": ["Magou Seck (Mossane)", "Isseu Niang (M\u00e8re Mingu\u00e9 Diouf)", "Moustapha Yade (Samba)", "Abou Camara (Oncle Baak)", "Alioune Konar\u00e9 (Fara)", "Alpha Diouph (Ngor)", "Ibou N'Dong (P\u00e8re Farba Diouf)", "Moussa Ciss\u00e9 (Le jeune mendiant)", "M\u00e9doune Seck (Vieux Senghane)", "Mbaye Diagne (Le patriarche)", "Daouda Lam (Diokel)", "Seynabou Gu\u00e8ye (Dibor)", "Cheikh Mar (Daouda)", "Djambodj Niang (Mam)", "Saliou Diouf (Sitor)", "Malick Dione (Ndiack)", "Alioune Badara Diagne (R\u00e9my)", "Mamadou Mahour\u00e9dia Gueye (Petit Pel\u00e9)", "Abdou Mama Diouf (P\u00e8re Ndour)", "Awa Tour\u00e9 (Fatou ou Dame Ndour)", "Mamadou Faye (L'imam)", "Anna Bob (Kangou)", "Sagana M'Baye (L'instituteur)", "Abasse N'Diaye (L'etudiant)", "Malick Diop (Le charretier)", "Moussa Camara (Les photos de Diogoye)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
