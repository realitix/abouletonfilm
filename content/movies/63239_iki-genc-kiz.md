As they become closer and closer the relationship becomes more fragile, and the impossibility of the survival of their relationship becomes more evident over time. Economic, social, psychological, and sexual problems come in the way. Behiye is angry and rebellious, but her frequent outbursts cut little ice with her conservative family. Handan is trapped in a different way, in a love-hate relationship with her single mother Leman. Although Leman is willing to turn tricks to raise Handan's college fees, she's otherwise hopeless with both men and money. When a mutual friend introduces Behiye and Handan they immediately hit it off, and despite the differences in their backgrounds they embark on an intense relationship, and with it a secret plan to escape their dysfunctional families.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zBBYIGc3GhmLzodq7otGP82JCrg.jpg", "actors": ["Feride \u00c7etin (Behliye)", "H\u00fclya Av\u015far (Leman)", "Vildan Atasever ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [54424], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
