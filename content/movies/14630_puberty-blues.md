The girls have to follow lots of strange customs, e.g. do not eat or go to the bathroom when a boy is around. Ugly girls have two choices - being bitches and hate boys, or being generally cheap and looked down upon by everyone. The afternoons are spent on the beaches, in the backseats of car or at home-alone-parties where sex and alcohol are the main ingredients. Parents and teachers are trying to straighten the kids out, but that is not easy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lNMLC48sKbPBup8ZlXUv8ZGM284.jpg", "actors": ["Nell Schofield (Debbie Vickers)", "Jad Capelja (Sue Knight)", "Geoff Rhoe (Garry)", "Tony Hughes (Danny)", "Jay Hackett (Bruce)", "Ned Lander (Strach)", "Michael Shearman (Glenn)", "Dean Dunstone (Seagull)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [36822, 25576, 14302, 14937], "youtube_key": "Ee2Hyn6D79A"}
