He takes the blame for the misdeeds of others, with the understanding that he will be exiled for one year and restored to the clan's good graces after the political situation dies down. As betrayal begins to heap upon betrayal, he realizes he'll have to live out his life as a master-less ronin, if not hunted down and killed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iNLJMruU27juOEUXUwIKkLEV56T.jpg", "actors": ["Raiz\u014d Ichikawa (Kobuse Takuma)", "Kaoru Yachigusa ()", "Shiho Fujimura ()", "Ichir\u00f4 Nakatani ()", "Akihisa Toda ()", "Yoshio Yoshida ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [37053, 48894, 37873, 49355], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
