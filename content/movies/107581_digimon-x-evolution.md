Its solution is Project Ark: to wipe out most of inhabitants with the X Program. Yggdrasill chooses a very small percentage to be moved to a new Digital World and then proceeds to destroy the old one. Some Digimon who were not chosen survive anyway, and they move to the new world with a rare gift known as the X Antibody; this antibody changes their appearance and makes them more powerful, while at the same time making them immune to the X Program. No longer in control, Yggdrasill uses the Royal Knights to destroy these X-Digimon, who are outcasts in the new Digital World.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rGt41OgXHQweEjVJIPrtCQSgNzh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
