Harry Benham and Mignon Anderson were versatile and popular Thanhouser stars, here showing considerable skill in light comedy, a genre that invites plenty of satirical social observation such as the burgeoning beauty-salon industry here. Cinema technique shows much more intricate editing and freer use of closeups than just a year or two earlier.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Harry Benham (Bob / Madam Blanche)", "Riley Chamberlin (Simon Southwick)", "Mrs. S.
