In the novel\u2019s six cantos, a young misanthrope indulges in depraved and destructive acts. Unexpected encounters abound, with turtles and birds joining Terayama\u2019s regular cast of snails and dogs to wander over books and bare torsos. Feverish video processing posterizes, inverts and overlays images that are further colored by sound\u2014pushing the limits of his literary adaptation. Terayama wrote that the only tombstone he wanted was his words, but, as Les chants de Maldoror demonstrates, words need not be confined to carved monuments or bound hardcopies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ufXc7MVpSAES855q5EROBFdlK9s.jpg", "actors": ["Keiko Niitaka ()", "Susumu Oono ()", "Yoko Ran ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
