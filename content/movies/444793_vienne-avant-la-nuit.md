What emerges is an emotionally powerful double portrait that reveals a search for identity with universal resonance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m7oVMtIrcGGqVtGDCgfsn2fkn7O.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Bober (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
