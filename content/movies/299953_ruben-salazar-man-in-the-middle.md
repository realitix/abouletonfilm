Killed under mysterious circumstances by a law enforcement officer in 1970, Salazar became an instant martyr to the Latino community--which had often criticized his reporting during his lifetime. Adding to the Salazar mystique is that the details of how he was killed have been obscured in the ensuing four decades since his death. Featuring material from recently released files obtained by the filmmaker, Ruben Salazar: Man in the Middle removes Salazar from the glare of myth and martyrdom and offers a clear-eyed look at the man. The film, produced and directed by Phillip Rodriguez, includes interviews with Salazar's friends, colleagues, family members, and Salazar's own words culled from personal writings", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
