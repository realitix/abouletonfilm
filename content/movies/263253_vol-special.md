They are accompanied by police officers and immigration officials. The passengers are flown to their native countries, where they haven't set foot in in up to twenty years, and where their lives might be in danger. Children, wives and work are left behind in Switzerland. Near Geneva, in Frambois prison, live 25 illegal immigrants waiting for deportation. They are offered an opportunity to say goodbye to their families and return to their native countries on a regular flight, escorted by plain-clothes police officers. If they refuse this offer, the special flight is arranged fast and unexpectedly. The stories behind the locked cells are truly heartbreaking.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rp3US2ThB8kqX5yatZaVFf3FZh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "9vL1PgyL0lk"}
