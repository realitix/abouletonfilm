A lavish new drama documentary by Ric Burns, based on governor William Bradford's extraordinary eye-witness account, the Mayflower Pilgrims reveals the grim truth behind their voyage across the Atlantic.  The Pilgrims story has come to define the founding moment of America and all it stands for. Celebrated each year at Thanksgiving, it is remembered as a pious crusade aimed at founding a Puritan paradise. However their journey from a harsh, often violent part of England to a colony assured of survival less than ten years later is also one of wealth, cruelty, and entrepreneurial genius.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/heWZJliswsXcvhIN1XtFol3S89X.jpg", "actors": ["Roger Rees (William Bradford)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
