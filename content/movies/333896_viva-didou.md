The camera travels freely, through the port, market, streets and caf\u00e9s, capturing everyday people, some of whom recur frequently enough to seem like protagonists. The nominal plotline follows a French tourist couple\u2019s leisurely visit to the city, the man having previously served in the army during the Algerian war. As they walk around, his comments betray his mindset\u2019s racist colonial prejudices, while his wife reiterates asinine clich\u00e9s. Their unhurried wandering is interrupted when he comes across a blind man and realises that he tortured him during his army service. The film is punctuated with punchy sequences that show a poet named Momo delivering verse as an elegy for Algiers.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Georges Arnaud ()", "Himmoud Brahimi (Momo, the poet)", "Suzie Nacer (The French Woman)", "Mohamed Zinet (Hassan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
