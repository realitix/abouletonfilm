Most likely it is the view of others which delimits our own identity, as a young divorced mother named Julieta convinces herself. This evening is like any other: her two young sons are roughhousing in their cramped apartment. They whoop and shout while their mother makes desperately futile attempts at the computer to concentrate on writing a report for work. Feeling intense pressure, Julieta tries to quiet the conflict but finds it difficult without a partner to help. The tense situation changes unexpectedly when her two-year-old falls and hurts himself. In this story of a mother suspected of hurting her own child, the movie investigates themes of motherhood, guilt, duty, the role of men and women, fathers and mothers", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hzwxXtf72bgajNHRZrrWPlfhJSX.jpg", "actors": ["\u00c9rica Rivas (Julieta)", "Nicasio Gal\u00e1n (Teo)", "Zen\u00f3n Gal\u00e1n (Valent\u00edn)", "Rub\u00e9n Viani (Guillermo)", "Marta Bianchi (Abuela)", "Osmar N\u00fa\u00f1ez ()", "Carlos Portaluppi ()", "Dar\u00edo Levy ()", "Lautaro Perotti ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
