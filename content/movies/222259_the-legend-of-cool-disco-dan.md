Despite ending up homeless Cool \"Disco\" Dan used graffiti to escape the social problems D.C. had in the 1980s when things turned violent and became known as the Murder Capital of the United States. Cool \"Disco\" Dan ends up as a cult character of DC and his name becomes a symbol of survival during DC's most trying years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rN3isTB6o6meriDwDnykefiB3hn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
