Popeye, who stayed behind, hears a radio report that Bluto is lost and sets sail himself (on a raft).

We see why Bluto has not been heard of: he has a bevy of native beauties attending to his every need.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c7NAWTjov9KKqf5OaadffV57tqE.jpg", "actors": ["Pinto Colvig (Bluto (voice))", "Jack Mercer (Popeye (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
