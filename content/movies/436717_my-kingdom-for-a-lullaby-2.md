The German play on words actually makes sense in MY KINGDOM FOR A LULLABY #2; it suits a piece, in which electronically generated sounds and images are modulated and combined in a thoroughly sensorial or even ecstatic manner. The term \u00abwhite noise\u00bb refers to both visual and acoustic elements. It is a prevailing theme in this video, an abstract piece, which requires that the viewer look and listen with utmost attention. On a white screen appear horizontal and vertical lines in delicate gray. First they alternate, then overlap, fade, then become more intense. The soundtrack plays a primary role, is equally as powerful (and elusive) as the images: a composition of crackling, noises (Rauschen), and whirring begins to emerge; music comprised of subtle electronic tones and high frequency distortion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pcqiGUPUF628GaIs41QfNYWY8JG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
