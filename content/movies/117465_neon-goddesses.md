We don't get to learn very much about these women, both because of the short running time (46 minutes) and because of the style of the film, which lingers at length observing particular scenes in their lives without any sort of omnicient narrator to describe the background of their lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eTV905lo1OtRrxfUTIRHOQzQh7B.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
