Those first encounters, when they try things, and when they remember other good times. They make you part of their experiences.This is the difference of putting at a credible story behind the sex encounters. \r\n\r\nAn amazing film, worth watching beyond its explicit sex. The way the tale manages to capture the psychological reasons behind the fixation on a particular gender/sex role, the limited nature of the \"tops and bottoms\" labels and an emancipation from these roles. A true ode to versatility."}], "recommandations_id": []}
