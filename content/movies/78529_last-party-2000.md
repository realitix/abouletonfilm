Hoffman shows an obvious distaste for money politics and the conservative right. He looks seedier and more disillusioned the campaign progresses. Eventually Hoffman seems most energized by the Ralph Nader campaign as an alternative to the nearly indistinguishable major parties. The high point of the film are the comments by Barney Frank who says that marches and demonstrations are largely a waste of time, and that the really effective political players such as the NRA and the AARP never bother with walk ins, sit-ins, shoot-ins or shuffles. In the interview with Jesse Jackson, Hoffman is too flustered to ask all of his questions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/60kINlXg1cuv9rNWbACBmjL5BlC.jpg", "actors": ["Philip Seymour Hoffman ()", "Ben Harper ()", "Noam Chomsky ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [58062, 26626, 92967, 98209], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
