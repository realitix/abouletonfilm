In 2014 Roberts filmed Islamic extremist Abu Rumaysah, who is now one of the world's most wanted men and is suspected of being the British jihadi in the latest IS execution video. This film gains extraordinary access to a new wave of extremists, including Rumaysah, who are radicalising and grooming young British Muslims, and asks whether they really have non-violent aims, as they claim, or are a genuine threat to society.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6iosTZ9Rf466vjZr0yqSfFt8NZY.jpg", "actors": ["Abu Rumaysah (Jihadi Sid)", "Khuram Butt ()", "Jamie Roberts (Narrator)", "Mohammed Emwazi (Jihadi John)", "Mohammed Shamsuddin ()", "Abu Haleema ()", "Theresa May ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [452235, 428601, 435738, 457552], "youtube_key": "RTX1IvBMhW8"}
