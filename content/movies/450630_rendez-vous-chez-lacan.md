Beyond the myth, the\r legends and sometimes, the curses, this film by G\u00e9rard Miller allows us to discover his work and his personality,\r through the testimony of his patients, his students, and also his relatives.\r Born with the XXth century in a Catholic, middle-class family, a psychiatrist by training, with an encyclopaedic\r knowledge of culture, a friend of Picasso, Levi-Strauss and Sartre, Lacan was a great theoretician, an outstanding\r practitioner, and he remains the most modern, the most challenging and even the most sulphurous of\r psychoanalysts.\r The director Gerard Miller met Lacan thanks to his brother, Jacques-Alain, the most faithful of his students, who\r married his daughter Judith. A close and intense relationship which makes this film exceptional.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qhUHWcMPkcB1c9R0erFanG8DYLN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
