To be polite, he stops on the way at a bakery to bring along a small gift for the in-laws. Unfortunately, he steps on some flypaper and has a devil of a time getting it off himself. When he arrives at the dinner, he's quite sticky and this causes LOTS of problems--which would have all been alleviated had he told them of his flypaper predicament.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Max Linder (Max)", "Gabrielle Lange ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
