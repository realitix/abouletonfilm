Six young people that try to avoid their solitude by complicating their daily routes, unsuccessfully looking for a glance that changes something or a new sensation that reveals them some sense. A couple used to their common tediousness, a girl who has already decided she wants to be alone, his boyfriend who does not know how to deal with that, a famous actor who does not seem to feel comfortable anywhere and a girl who pretends to get fun without realizing she's always bored.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yVmf8dBboKhH2mLWbIBVxbKTxow.jpg", "actors": ["Gast\u00f3n Pauls (Gast\u00f3n Pauls)", "Daniel Hendler (Mart\u00edn)", "Camila Toker (Camila)", "Mariana Anghileri (Natalia)", "Leonardo Mur\u00faa (Leopoldo)", "Eva Sola (Andrea)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "qgyVwtDkDME"}
