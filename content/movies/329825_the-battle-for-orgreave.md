A community fighting for jobs and survival was wholly denigrated and depicted as violent by the majority of the media. THE BATTLE FOR ORGREAVE puts the record straight, as miners recount their own history, their economic and political struggles over decades and the trial they endured for 48 days in Sheffield when charged with riot at Orgreave - facing life imprisonment. Containing compelling testimonies, emotive cinematography, in depth analysis coupled with meticulous detail of the mass picket and the ensuing events of June 18 1984 at the Orgreave coking plant, the documentary also has unique footage of police violence -- all these make this an historic and important document of our time", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gG2J6OzdQcyNTVcQshvQ9QFHWWE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
