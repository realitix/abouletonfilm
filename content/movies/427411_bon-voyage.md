But while sailing through the night, far away from land, they discover an overloaded refugee boat, close to sinking. They are shocked, but too afraid to help. So they call the coast guards but loose the boat out of sight into the darkness of the night. In the early morning they find themselves drifting through an ocean of dead bodies. The refugee boat has sunk. Jonas and Silvia manage to pull a few survivors out of the cold water: Syrians. This rescue marks the beginning of a dramatic conflict between the hopes and dreams of the refugees, and the fears and ideals of the holiday sailors.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/weKg4x4jsZiXCH0KaJw6bH1TeEZ.jpg", "actors": ["Jay Abdo (Kareem)", "Stefan Gubser (Jonas)", "Suhair Omran (Maha)", "Annelore Sarbach (Silvia)", "Amed Ali (Thabit)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
