Poly then takes us through a range of emotions of what can only be described as a carthartic episode before ending on the same unnerving note it began with. Brambilla composes the video brilliantly, creating mesh-like layers of Poly\u2019s face that scatter and converge as he explores the idea of mulitplicity within the human psyche.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
