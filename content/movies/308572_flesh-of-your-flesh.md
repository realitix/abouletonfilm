The supernatural force released starts to turn innocent people into bloodthirsty killers (a combination of zombies and vampires) but the military and most who live in the countryside of Cali are unaware of this.  There is also a little political subtext when incest becomes involved, though if they are possessed, does that take on a new meaning?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fbOxu2t7H94gJfsqbUENN5IdJNQ.jpg", "actors": ["Adriana Herr\u00e1n ()", "David Guerrero ()", "Santiago Garc\u00eda ()", "Vicky Hern\u00e1ndez (Julia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
