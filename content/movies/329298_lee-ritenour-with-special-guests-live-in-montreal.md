They included frequent jazz-rock collaborator Ernie Watt, and David Benoit, master of a \"jazz-lite\" style. But guitarist Lee Ritenour is key man here: he calls most of the shots, and six of the eight pieces are his, including a fine tribute to early inspiration Wes Montgomery on \"24th Street Blues.\" For the most part, easy-going and mellow are the watchwords on this program - not surprising since the players tend to be based in Los Angeles. Ritenour's \"Etude\" stands out for its creation of atmosphere, and so do Dave Valentin's solo melodic meanderings on a selection of wooden flutes backed by his own vocal effects. All elements considered the bill is a demonstration of top-drawer musicianship, awareness of contemporary styles \u2013 and versatility.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uFThY9P0c5M2rlaSIgpsdZVoWlo.jpg", "actors": ["Lee Ritenour (Guitar)", "David Benoit (Keyboards)", "Don Grusin (Keyboards)", "Ernie Watts (Tenor Saxophone)", "Dave Valentin (Flute)", "Abraham Laboriel (Bass)", "Gary Novak (Drums)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
