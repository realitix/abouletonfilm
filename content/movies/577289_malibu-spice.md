His accountant Rip Hymen suggests that he give one of his most profitable ventures, a Malibu health spa, to its buff and horny employees, among them Jenna Fine and hot European import Moana. When the ladies get the news, they're so excited they start screwing everybody in sight and don't stop until the end of the tape. A work-out room orgy lead by Fine is the tape's sexual highlight, followed closely by Moana's stand-up coupling with Marc Wallice. Hard bodies, hot sex and the amazing Ms. Jenna Fine make this a memorable classic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qnLWiVs0wTZZPhZLe8vii4X2Z48.jpg", "actors": ["Jeanna Fine (Paula)", "Moana Pozzi (Gina)", "Ashlyn Gere (Shelly)", "Angela Summers (Sloan's Secretary)", "K.C.
