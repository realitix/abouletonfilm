The film illustrates Lisa's connection with nature but also the essence of her music and singing as strong spiritual expression. Each section talks about the different components of Lisa's career: her beginnings with the formation of the Dead Can Dance group with Brendan Perry in the '80s, her film solo career, the reformation of Dead Can Dance for a world tour in 2005 and aspects of her family life which support and influence her work.
