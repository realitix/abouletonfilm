After the Chief of Police was brutally murdered, much of the city's Sicilian population was rounded up and brought in for questioning. Eventually, thirteen were formally tried for murder and nine went to trial, and while they were acquitted, a series of brutal lynchings showed they had as much to fear from the city's general populace as they did from the corrupt police force.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gFZB9VN5r5UomG5bRcEHMWbSuTX.jpg", "actors": ["Christopher Walken (James Houston)", "Luke Askew (William Parkerson)", "Clancy Brown (Chief Hennessy)", "Alessandro Colla (Gaspare Marchesi)", "Andrew Connolly (Sheriff Bill Villere)", "Bruce Davison (Thomas Semmes)", "Joaquim de Almeida (Joseph Macheca)", "Andrea Di Stefano (Vincent Provenzano)", "Edward Herrmann (D.A.
