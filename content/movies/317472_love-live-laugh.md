In love with the beautiful Margharita (Lila Lee), Luigi lands a job in the music store owned by the girl's uncle. Ultimately, however, our hero does the Pagliacci act when Margharita evinces a preference for handsome Pasquale (David Rollins). The film's best scene takes place in a nursery full of talented tots, a sequence that undoubtedly reminded Jessel of his days with Gus Edwards' \"Schoolroom\" act. Exercising his droit du seigneur, Georgie Jessel sings the title tune.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["George Jessel (Luigi)", "Lila Lee (Margharita)", "David Rollins (Pasquale Gallupi)", "Henry Kolker (Enrico)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
