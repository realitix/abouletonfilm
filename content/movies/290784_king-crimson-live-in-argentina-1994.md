The new band recorded the mini album \u201cVROOOM\u201d in the Spring of 1994 and, following further rehearsals in the summer and early autumn, performed a series of concerts in Argentina, including a run of shows at Teatro Broadway, Buenos Aires in October.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/clLf9dFZIDiYJwqVcKFIxWLY0V8.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Fripp (Guitar, Soundscapes)", "Adrian Belew (Guitar, Voice, Words)", "Tony Levin (Upright & Electric Basses, Backing Vocals)", "Trey Gunn (Stick, Backing Vocals)", "Bill Bruford (Acoustic & Electronic Percussions)", "Pat Mastelotto (Acoustic & Electronic Percussions)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
