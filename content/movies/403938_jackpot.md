He is upset to discover his wife has moved on and does not want him back.\r\n\r\nCarl plans to crack a safe in 'The Jackpot Club'. He enlists the help of former safecracker Lenny Lane who now runs a coffee shop.\r\n\r\nThey rob the club of \u00a36,000 but shoot a policeman dead while making their getaway. Both the police and the club owner try to track them down.\r\n\r\nThis is a low key crime thriller and a rarely seen one. It features William Hartnell playing the detective trying to catch the bad guys. He usually played military types or low rent villains until he got cast in Doctor Who.\r\n\r\nThe print quality of the film is not very good, but it is a pleasant and cheaply made B movie."}], "recommandations_id": []}
