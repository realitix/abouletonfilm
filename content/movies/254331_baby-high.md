This is a High School specifically tailored for pregnant teenagers &amp; teenage moms. School buses come equipped with baby seats, there's onsite daycare &amp; health clinic, parenting classes are on the curriculum -- and the lockers are pink. With teen pregnancy rates on the rise, and the consequences often devastating, TAPP is designed to give these teens - who otherwise would most likely dropout - a chance to stay on course and graduate despite the fact they're becoming moms at such a young age.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
