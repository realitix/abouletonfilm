At the start of the millennium, a church was built there with support of local inhabitants' relatives from Taiwan. On Sundays, up to 900 people gather to worship, while spending most of their days maintaining a modest living as farmers. Their faith governs how they handle family conflicts, illnesses and other difficulties. Still, they must contend with constraining forces in their community, from ancient folk religious practices to laws forbidding evangelism.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pU8eXaycaPuvgrj1aGD2YrOoGSV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
