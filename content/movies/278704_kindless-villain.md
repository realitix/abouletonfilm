Seemingly alone in their island world, the boys succumb to fatigue, and to rituals of power. Scratched phrases from an ancient recording of Hamlet reveal a sad cry for vengeance. War is a child's game, played quietly in this forgotten world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8U9uf0tlRkNI6i4J8IRHeKoXmYV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
