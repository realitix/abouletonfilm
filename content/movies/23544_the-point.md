Everyone in The Land of Point had a point at the top of its head. Everyone, that is, except Oblio, who was born round-headed. Since he had no point, Oblio, along with his trusty dog, Arrow, was banished to the Pointless Forest. Join them to see what wonders await these two intrepid travelers as they make their way on their amazing, song-filled journey of discovery!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7S5BY8G6WFWJWtbO7RCNsRJjmbl.jpg", "actors": ["Ringo Starr (Narrator / Father (home video release) (voice))", "Paul Frees (Oblio's Father / Pointed Man's Right Head / King / Leaf Man / Villagers (voice))", "Lennie Weinrib (Count (voice) (as Lenny Weinrib))", "Buddy Foster (Count's Son (voice))", "Joan Gerber (Oblio's Mother (voice))", "Mike Lookinland (Oblio (voice))", "Bill Martin (Rock Man (voice))", "Alan Barzman (Narrator / Father (second telecast))", "Dustin Hoffman (Narrator / Father (First Telecast))", "Alan Thicke (Narrator / Father (third telecast))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [36486, 65489, 19373, 18146], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
