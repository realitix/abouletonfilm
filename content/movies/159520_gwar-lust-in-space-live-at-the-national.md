New members just assume the roles of the already-established stage characters (see past members section for more details - note: BalSac, and BalSac the Jaws Of Death are different characters).\r The band sometimes performs as Rawg - GWAR w/o the costumes (this is due to limited stage space in some small clubs).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1ddpjf21VwJJwMTsTlDqN14jbUu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
