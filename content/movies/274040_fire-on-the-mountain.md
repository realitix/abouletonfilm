Desalius.  The hero of the movie is Vogelin, a New Mexico rancher whose land adjoins the White Sands Missile Range and is about to be condemned by the United States Air Force to use his land to expand a bombing range. He is the last holdout among the several people whose land the Air Force wants, and he refuses to move. A young land developer, Mackie, is sent to vacate the rancher, but soon he joins in defying the military. Soon it boils down to a battle of wills between Vogelin and the equally bullheaded army officer Colonel Desalius.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dTHXrED5QSlZ6ofhRWiCXLQiTQx.jpg", "actors": ["Buddy Ebsen (John Vogelin)", "Ron Howard (Lee Mackie)", "Julie Carmen (Cruza Peralta)", "Rossie Harris (Billy Starr)", "Ed Brodow (Maj.
