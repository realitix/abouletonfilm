She innocently takes the ride to reach home faster. To Maya\u2019s horror, the service did not stop at her place. She soon realizes she has been taken, along with the other kids who are inside the crammed school service. Soon, Maya finds herself hours and hours away from home, in an unfamiliar land -Manila. By dusk, the children are dropped off along the national highway to work by begging for alms. Forced to struggle with the harsh conditions of street life, Maya continues to hope for her dreams and chase for her freedom that may never happen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s6SIM4B3lhMTXkZ3qepj9Wi0ddP.jpg", "actors": ["Ai-Ai de las Alas ()", "Joel Lamangan ()", "Celine Juan ()", "Therese Malvar ()", "Felixia Crysten Dizon ()", "Joe Gruta ()", "Ken-ken Nuyad ()", "Kevin Sagra ()", "Santino Oquendo ()", "Ace Caf\u00e9 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
