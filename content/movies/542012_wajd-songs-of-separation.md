Verite footage of their daily lives weaves together with bittersweet musical performances, traditional Su ceremonies, and poetic imagery of a pre-war Syria that no longer exists. What unfolds is a cinematic meditation on loss, yearning, and faith.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iVbjZf266HO5yBI0eMo6pxDq29d.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
