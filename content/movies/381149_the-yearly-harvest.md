Years ago another famous journalist died in an accident there while investigating the same story. Jin travels to Selah hoping to unravel the mystery, suspicious of a darker truth behind the festive holiday. Upon arrival she's stunned by the lack of decorations, lights, and signs, as well as the refusal of most locals to even talk about 'Christmas'. After a violent encounter she's saved by Private Investigator Amy Carson, who is trailing several Missing Persons cases that have led her to Selah. As they continue prying, they realize that the secrets Selah is hiding are far more terrifying than they could've ever imagined.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qHRzSzKIXb1PEycBsfXwyXL5OSJ.jpg", "actors": ["Tiffany Browne-Tavarez (Jin Maddison)", "Linda McLaughlin (Amy)", "Adison Eisenberg (Lyndsey Maddison)", "Victoria Guthrie (Ms. Maddison)", "Melissa Malone (Marlene)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
