Filmed in black &amp; white DV with vintage costume, props etc. Computer filtered to look old and emulate framerate. This is probably my favorite movie project, since I had a relatively easy time filming it and was quite pleased with the results. The fact we did the entire thing in 9 months didn\u2019t hurt either!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
