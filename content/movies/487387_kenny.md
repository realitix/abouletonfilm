In his first season as player manager, he achieved the League and FA Cup double with Liverpool. Then he rebuilt the squad by adding John Barnes and Peter Beardsley.\r\n\r\nKenny is instead a sombre film framed in tragedy. Nothing to do with the shortcomings of Kenny Dalglish but the the events that affected his beloved club.\r\n\r\nThe 1985 Heysel disaster where 39 Juventus fans lost their lives before the European Cup Final with Liverpool. Then in 1989 the Hillsborough disaster that led to the death of 96 Liverpool fans.\r\n\r\nKenny Dalglish went to the funeral of each and every victim of Hillsborough. It took a toll in his health and in 1991 he walked out of the Liverpool manager's job.\r\n\r\nDalglish was always reluctant when talking to the press. Here he reveals a little more about himself and his impish humour."}], "recommandations_id": [64998, 486882, 561894, 462145], "youtube_key": "6mA6uA2-Rcw"}
