ZEMBLA is investigating another explosive dossier concerning Trump\u2019s involvement with the Russians: Trump\u2019s business and personal ties to oligarchs from the former Soviet Union. Powerful billionaires suspected of money laundering and fraud, and of having contacts in Moscow and with the mafia. What do these relationships say about Trump and why does he deny them? How compromising are these dubious business relationships for the 45th president of the United States? And are there connections with the Netherlands? ZEMBLA meets with one of Trump\u2019s controversial cronies and speaks with a former CIA agent, fraud investigators, attorneys, and an American senator among others.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mNHNPdtqmDEwqScZWaJjeJPQFtI.jpg", "actors": ["Frederick Oberlander (Himself)", "Tevfik Arif (Himself)", "Tevfik Arif (Himself (archive footage))", "Felix Sater (Himself)", "Julius Schwartz (Himself (archive footage))", "Donald Trump (Himself (archive footage))", "Vladimir Putin (Himself (archive footage))", "Malcom Nance (Himself - Former U.S. Intelligence Officer)", "Malcom Nance (Himself)", "Michael D'Antonio (Himself)", "James Henry (Himself)", "Semion Mogilevich (Himself (archive footage))", "Michael Bird (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "1bEdMuKq30I"}
