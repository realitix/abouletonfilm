A committed tech-geek, she fears she is more interested in ultrasound technology than in what's being ultra-sounded.  When her sister lures her to L.A. for what ends up being a terrorizing baby shower, Sarah keeps her rental van and hits the road in search of the source of her anxiety: her estranged mother, now living off the grid.  Small, Beautifully Moving Parts takes a comical, yet poignant look at one woman's coming-of-parenthood in the age of technology.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kqZmEWYL1PXdmdL9WvpCqq8XSVd.jpg", "actors": ["Anna Margaret Hollyman (Sarah Sparks)", "Andr\u00e9 Holland (Leon)", "Sarah Rafferty (Emily)", "Susan Kelechi Watson (Towie)", "Mary Beth Peil (Marjorie)", "Rich Hoag (Henrique)", "Timothy McCracken (George)", "Jan Sandwich (Guru)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "knY_wfmOoA8"}
