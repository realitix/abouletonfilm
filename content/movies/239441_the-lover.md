The silent encounters act as counterpoint to a contemplative internal monologue musing on love, loss and the subtle power-plays of aversion and desire underway in an atmosphere pervaded by an irresistible erotic gloom. Filmed in a lustrous black and white, the themes explored find their perfect compliment in the stark, fascinated, all-embracing gaze of the camera. - Robert Avila", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4MLI1AJ9P2S3eEJjL2YsRiz0OzD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [190085, 166092, 49176, 86118], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
