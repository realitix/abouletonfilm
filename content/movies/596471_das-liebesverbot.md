Wagner's adaptation of the story reflects the rebellious mood of a Revolutionary Germany, vindicating sensual love and attack the fanatical repression of sexuality by a puritanical and hypocritical authority. As the prose says, \"Shame to him whose cruel striking/Kills for faults of his own liking!\". One of the most extraordinary musicals based on a text by Shakespeare, especially worthy of a new performance as it is four hundred years since the death of the Bard.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nTwX8Dy84BRFSFpz7wn10mQVAlw.jpg", "actors": ["Christopher Maltman (Friedrich)", "Peter Lodahl (Lucio)", "Ilker Arcay\u00fcrek (Claudio)", "David Alegret (Antonio)", "David Jerusalem (Angelo)", "Manuela Uhl (Isabella)", "Mar\u00eda Mir\u00f3 (Mariana)", "Ante Jerkunica (Brighella)", "Isaac Gal\u00e1n (Danieli)", "Mar\u00eda Hinojosa (Dorella)", "Francisco Vas (Pontio Pilato)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
