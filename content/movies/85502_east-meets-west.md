For generations, they have been reincarnated as mere mortals, and they won't be allowed back to heaven until they've learned to coexist in harmony. Then in today's Hong Kong, a mortuary beautician and her has-been singer dad are chased for a huge sum of money they don't owe. Turns out her materialistic stepmom has taken a tycoon's advance payment on the false promise of organizing a concert that she can't deliver. The family is therefore forced to go on the run, and along the way they meet an assortment of quirky people, including a mute baker, a kung fu cab driver, an aspiring musician and her crafty sidekick. Through a series of comic misadventures, the seven of them come to realize that they used to be gods and have a mission in this life, but...who is the eighth god that has yet to rejoin them?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tUnNXUI4PZ6DGhsM777H90CONZW.jpg", "actors": ["Eason Chan ()", "Ekin Cheng ()", "Karen Mok ()", "Jaycee Chan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ydIyu5Xvc3s"}
