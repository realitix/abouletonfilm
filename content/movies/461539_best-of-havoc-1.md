Now in Best of Havoc 1 we present the very best crashes from many thousands of hours of original motorsport archive in one entertaining and often hilarious DVD.  There's metal curling madness in all its forms, trucks doing the monster mash, Formula Fordsters taking up aeronautics, mud-wrestling quads, the Formula 2 'take-off' at the Nurburgring, Bike GP rodeo riders, Paris-Dakar dune-busters, manic motocrossers and the 10 out of 10 performances of the nutty Norwegian rally brigade - these are just a few of over 200 megaprangs that have crashed their way into the Havoc hall of fame!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6JL53bxFRARLewpXdbo7DIRQhps.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Nichols (Comentator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
