That night they are attacked by a werewolf and Paul is the only survivor, but there is a price to pay one year later as Paul begins to feel the effect of his body and mind transform as he had suffered an injury in the attack. Now Paul only has one person to turn to for help and that is his psychologist Dr. Sarah Sandla. Sandla is skeptical about Paul's crazy stories of becoming a werewolf.
