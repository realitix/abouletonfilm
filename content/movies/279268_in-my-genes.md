For one thing, she has albinism - a lack of pigment in the skin, hair and eyes - and her appearance has provoked prejudice from family, friends and strangers since she was born. But despite all odds, Agnes refuses to lead a life of sorrow. This fascinating and inspiring documentary also shares the stories of seven other people's individual experiences of living their lives with albinism in Kenya, a predominantly black society. While each person's story is unique, they all have one thing in common: they know what it is like to stand out uncomfortably from the crowd.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kuPGuvTnXKk7VHmhTT0w9CHBKC1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
