Tribute bands go to extraordinary lengths to re-create the experience of rock supergroups like Kiss, Journey, Judas Priest and Queen. Tribute follows the on- and off-stage struggles of tribute bands and their fans in their quest to live their rock dreams. Together they face band members quitting, soul-sucking day jobs, even bandmates who take the impersonation far too far.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6fiZO6z8OfofCMsuZ0zA5YwQVEk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
