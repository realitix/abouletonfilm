These \"street skiers\" dedicate their lives to pushing the limits of what is possible on skis in urban environments. Jumping off four story buildings, flying into 50 ft high dams, flipping over staircases; these are some of the most daring athletes in the world. This bizarre sport seems like all fun and games, but then horrific injuries, relentless illegal behavior, and their \"at all costs\" mentality shows that, to them, this is much more. This film takes you behind the scenes into the lives of these passionate individuals to find out why they think it is all worth it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/67s1C2dT3u780X635wtmU6Xgt1f.jpg", "actors": ["Cam Riley ()", "Clayton Villa ()", "Sean Jordan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
