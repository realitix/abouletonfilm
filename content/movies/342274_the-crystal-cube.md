The pilot was one of Fry and Laurie's first television appearances and the first show they had written themselves. However, the BBC chose not to take it to a full series, and Fry and Laurie did not get a chance to make their own programme for the BBC until 1989, when they produced their first full series of the more conventional sketch show A Bit of Fry and Laurie, after a pilot in 1987.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/seAitjpaQ1ENvYAz7nJlkTZLE0j.jpg", "actors": ["Hugh Laurie (Max Belhaven)", "Stephen Fry (Dr. Adrian Cowlacey)", "Emma Thompson (Jackie Meld)", "Robbie Coltrane (Martin Bealey)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
