As with A Drifting Life and Murmur of Youth, Lin\u2019s new film delicately unfolds, gradually building to a climax of stunning emotional reverberations. Drawn from a particularly painful episode in the director\u2019s past, Sweet Degeneration delves into the uneasy bonds a brother and sister have with each other and the people around them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qLw8CCxDibLRk8KKUkVNmTXKvys.jpg", "actors": ["Lee Kang-Sheng (Chun-sheng)", "Leon Dai (Ah-hai)", "Chen Shiang-Chyi (Ju-feng)", "Pen-yu Chang (Mei-li)", "Shih-huang Chen (Father)", "Chao-yin Hsiao (Hsiao-lien)", "Tze-min Hsiao (Mei-li's friend)", "Lee Sun-Fung (Motel chef)", "Chih-long Lin (Ah-ching)", "Li-jung Lu (Prostitute)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
