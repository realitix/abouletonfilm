The plot centers on the political intrigues between Boccanegra (Domingo) and his adversary, the aristocratic Jacopo Fiesco, and the discovery of his long-lost daughter, Amelia. This story though replete with an inevitable tragic conclusion is ultimately one of hope, as the two great men are able to rise above their power-driven animosities to ensure peace amongst their beloved Genoa's warring factions and by placing familial and civic love ahead of their own individual desires.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m86XTWbg3L6MmNYTVXjYzNIaACZ.jpg", "actors": ["Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (Simon Boccanegra)", "Marina Poplavskaya (Amelia)", "Joseph Calleja (Gabriele Adorno)", "Ferruccio Furlanetto (Jacopo Fiesco-Andrea)", "Jonathan Summers (Paolo Albani)", "Lukas Jakobski (Pietro)", "Louise Armit (Criada)", "Lee Hickenbottom (Capitan)", "Antonio Pappano (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
