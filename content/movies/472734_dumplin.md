As a life-long Dolly Parton fan, I would have been eager to see it if I had known several characters would idolize her and that Dolly's life and career would serve as an inspiration to all.  The movie is a feel-good gem.  Danielle MacDonald is a future favorite, and Jennifer Aniston shows real talent in making her cliched character something more.  I recommend it to all."}], "recommandations_id": [449563, 556803, 462919, 519035]}
