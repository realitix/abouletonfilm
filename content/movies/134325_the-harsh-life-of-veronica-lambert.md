Her desperation to see her desires fulfilled is palpable as she acclimatizes to big city life, while assuaged by the good intentions of Mr. New York, an old-time movie hustler who befriends the new arrival to the Hollywood scene. Her interest in true love and naivete in life becomes fodder for her married lover, who ultimately seduces her into a criminally-sociopathic and brutal act.
