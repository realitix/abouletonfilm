Set in a blank white space and backed by an ominous soundtrack, these hybrid creatures mutate from human to object to animal to machine. Some changes seem natural\u2014the smooth transition of aging hands\u2014while others are unsettling\u2014humans turning into monsters. Laric intersperses these animated runs with stills of disturbing, digitally-modeled \u201ccrossbreeds\u201d\u2014slick machines with lumpy human arms and legs; a melted humanoid in a black oily pool on the ground surrounded by clothing he once wore; a submissive hybrid on its hands and knees in front of a standing woman, who is taking its picture like an animal at the zoo. Together, these images destabilize notions of past and present, original and copy, even human and nonhuman.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
