Founded in 2003, the troop has traveled around the world and all continents with their projects.  They call Corporn\u00f4 (from \"hardcore\" and \"porn\") the Cia Dita atomic bomb, supersonic, crossing the sky with a ray of light in the deluded world of Puritans. Corporn\u00f4 is a fine line between erotica and pornography.  Heroes dive into the depths of the human being, incredibly representing what is animal, social, human, and inhumane in each of us.  The show premiered in April 2013 and today is the most sought-after performance of the band.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/otvxRKMs44bVF19a8bCg0CdaVWg.jpg", "actors": ["Cia Dita ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
