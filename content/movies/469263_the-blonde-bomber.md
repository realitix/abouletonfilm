Their first sale is their last, when a burly customer realizes he's been had. Next stop, Joe, Knobby and Punchy load up at a local diner, and Knobby has a scheme to skip out on the bill. Of course, the diner owner turns out to be their watch customer, and the boys make a hasty exit with the manager's waitress girlfriend in tow.  Knobby books Palooka into a local vaudeville house to put on some exhibition bouts. Of course, their friend from the diner is in the audience, with a bag of rotten tomatoes, and he's more than willing to come on stage when Knobby asks for a volunteer to box with Joe.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Robert Norton (Joe Palooka)", "Shemp Howard (Knobby Walsh)", "Lee Weber (Punchy)", "Harry Gribbon (Diner Manager)", "John Berkes (Johnnie (as Johnnie Berkes))", "Mary Doran (Marcy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
