People holding cardboard signs asking for spare change. Most of the time we look away, staring intently at the red light waiting for it to change. Other times we say 'sorry' and keep walking. Whether you give them money or not, have you ever stopped to ask their story? Cardboard is a documentary about the world of panhandling in Seattle. It tells the stories of those on the streets as well as the truth about scam artists. We often wonder about the story behind the sign. This is that story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wofj5SKNraA8N2AHxji1SZjSRw7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
