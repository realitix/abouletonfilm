{"tmdb_id": 362319, "title": "Habitat", "original_title": "Habitat", "slug_title": "habitat", "date": "2014-10-03", "genre": ["Animation"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "\"It\u2019s not until we arrive at Habitat does the wandering eye of Ratt\u00e9\u2019s interlocuteur find respite in a cascading curved form soaked in the color of a pale sunset. The revelation of this habitat creates a visual serenity rarely found within the quivering feedback lines previously employed in Ratt\u00e9\u2019s work. The simplicity and exactness of the vertical lines that dance across the screen in Habitat suggest a kind of transcendental arrival at a near-perfect modular frequency where the input and output harmonize. These lines are pulled back like stage curtains to expose once more the gleaming horizon, this time delicately tinged with a rainbow spectrum created from gamma ramped signal saturation.\"  - Nicholas O'Brien", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/knpqRdcBxQNjbbWAXlUYJClGATE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
