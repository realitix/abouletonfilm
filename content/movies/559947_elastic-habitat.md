Helena Dietrich designed the textile figures with Janneke Raaphorst, based on one-on-one sessions with various guests. In these discussions, they investigated their personal perceptions of their own bodies. Does your personality completely coincide with this body and everything surrounding it? And if you change it in any way, do you change too? You literally inhabit an imaginary body and thus have the time to explore your own identity in an uninhibited, sensory, intuitive way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uXdxsbTsnaLwO3kMcX73Y4GOObA.jpg", "actors": ["Irina Lavrinovi\u010d ()", "Esta Matkovi\u0107 ()", "Julien Bruneau ()", "Helena Dietrich ()", "Janneke Raaphorst ()", "Lili Mihaijlovic ()", "Dolores Hulan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
