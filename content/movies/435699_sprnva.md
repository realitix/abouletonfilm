He is on the cusp of a discovery that will change the world as we know it. Late one night in his lab as he tracks a mysterious object hurdling toward Earth, he has a dream: in it, he is able to see - an impossibility for a man in his condition. It is actually a glimpse into the future, proof that he is one of the first people to experience the object's effects. As one of the few who can help prevent the event, will he choose to stay blind and save life as we know it? Or gain sight and let society fend for itself?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Gregory Smith (Nolan Wilander)", "Chloe Rose (Angie)", "Joseph Ziegler (Dr. Everett)", "Rayisa Kondracki (Julianna)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
