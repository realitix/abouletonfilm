During the Christmas Eve blizzard, Lisa travels to Toyland in Wizard of Oz-like fashion and arrives just in time for a wedding. Young Mary Contrary is about to marry mean, old Barnaby Barnacle, despite the fact that she loves Jack Be Nimble. Lisa tries to stop this terrible wedding and, together with her new friends, discovers that Barnaby wants to take over Toyland. Lisa, Mary, Jack, and Georgie Porgie ask the Toymaster for help, but he can't help them as long as Lisa doesn't truly believe in toys.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mTg72oYoK18oV1uuuZGW2JI752x.jpg", "actors": ["Drew Barrymore (Lisa Piper)", "Richard Mulligan (Barnie / Barnaby Barnicle)", "Eileen Brennan (Mrs. Piper / Widow Hubbard)", "Keanu Reeves (Jack Fenton / Jack-be-Nimble)", "Pat Morita (The Toymaster)", "Jill Schoelen (Mary Piper / Mary Contrary)", "Googy Gress (George / Georgie Porgie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [17485, 36852, 62768, 369665], "youtube_key": "q6QxuPf1G1c"}
