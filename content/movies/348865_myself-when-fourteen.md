The film-maker reminisces about being 14 and describes the rotoscoping process. Ivor Cantrill is autistic, and his attention to detail and his preoccupation with repetition are positive aspects of his condition.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/joNc4Hu9C6RtqDnej0JobtuusUN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
