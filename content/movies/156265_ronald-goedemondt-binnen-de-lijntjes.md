Ronald Goedemondt's Between the Lines was nominated for the Poelifinario 2011 (VSCD Comedy Award for the theater(s) with the most impressive program of the season).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/heqHxAwRuM1esDmpsPrffRkMYIF.jpg", "actors": ["Ronald Goedemondt (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
