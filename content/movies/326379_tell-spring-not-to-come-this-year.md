Security, much less peace, would seem to be unattainable; it is even difficult to find a common language in a country where everyone mistrusts each other. The directors of this film accompanied an ANA company during a year of frontline duty in Helmand. The soldiers are paid irregularly, there are not enough supplies and their equipment is substandard. They cannot fight a war with the equipment left behind by the ISAF.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k04kHvBw6QaYVjB4wylTPmiLHqz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
