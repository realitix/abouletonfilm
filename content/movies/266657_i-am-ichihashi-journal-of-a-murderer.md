Ichihashi escapes the police dragnet to Aomori, 550 kilometres away. Learning that he is wanted by the law, he cuts his own lips to change his features. Burdened by guilt, he continues to avoid the law enforcement. He travels 1000 kilometres to Shikoku to participate in a pilgrimage in hope of resurrecting his murder victim. Obviously it fails and he remains a fugitive. As if to escape his own guilt he changes his identity and has cosmetic surgery to further alter his features. He works at construction sites and when people get suspicious of him he flees to a far-off island in Okinawa where he relies on survival skills.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ljlv5OqUtDBDtEat4KDFDmgeqnT.jpg", "actors": ["Dean Fujioka ()", "Takashi Nishina ()", "Shin'ichi Tsuha ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
