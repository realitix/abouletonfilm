Inspired by the Legion of Honor\u2019s role as a location for Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s Vertigo (1958), Hershman Leeson explores the tension at the core of Vertigo between the difficulty or lack of desire to distinguish between reality and fiction versus the pursuit of truth. The eponymous ghost of Hershman Leeson\u2019s project is the elusive nature of a singular identity that haunts the characters in the 1958 film, its most enigmatic representation being the painting of a supposed distant relative of the film\u2019s protagonist Madeleine, around which her character and fate is imagined.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xtFyRH5Dc9EndMxQsMwmZVx0rik.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
