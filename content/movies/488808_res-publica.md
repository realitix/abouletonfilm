He tries to make an apology for the freedom that he has not been able to achieve, despite his permanent rebellion, only in some occasions when he has loved, with the few women he has had, with the friendship of a few friends and with the family of which only the father remains. He is happy when he knows that he will be released and he will achieve the absolute freedom so desired. Until the last moment, he retains the irony and a subtle humor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fnjZk42sD9cEFHsy7ZZDVg2F6Up.jpg", "actors": ["Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Blanco ()", "Bel\u00e9n Fabra ()", "Alba Ferrara ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
