Presented under the brand \"The Color Bar Lounge,\" a cocktail bar in the mythical 1984 Miss General Idea Pavilion, the program is a hybrid of popular television formats [\u2026] and infomercial. [\u2026] Advertisements for the bar are placed throughout the program; a loaded word choice, full of double-entendres and innuendo, betrays the influence of both Dadaism and consumerism. This collapse of popular and high culture is central to General Idea's agenda, as Felix Partz observes: \"You know, the mass media are like a vast pharmaceutical complex developing new cultural elixirs of an unprecedented intoxication\u2026but art remains a curious and elitist drink. Despite its unique flavor and heady cultural properties, it has never effectively been exploited.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vHgfzQ7ou1LLrxFJCxU4FdPPs38.jpg", "actors": ["AA Bronson (Himself)", "Felix Partz (Himself)", "Jorge Zontal (Himself)", "Marina Abramovi\u0107 ()", "Titus Muizelaar ()", "Wies Smals ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
