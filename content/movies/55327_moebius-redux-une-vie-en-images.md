He achieved his greatest fame as Moebius - not so much a pseudonym as an alter ego. With his triple-split personality - Jean Giraud, Moebius, Gir - he succeeded in making his work accessible in popular comic strip series like Blueberry, in metaphysical fantasies like John Difool and, not least, to a broad public, with set designs for films such as The Fifth Element. In Moebius Redux - A Life in Pictures an exceptional artist tells his life's and work's story. Extraordinary views on Paris, Los Angeles and the Mexican desert build a visual link between his life and his artistic universe, accompanied by the electronic soundtrack composed by \"Kraftwerk\" legend Karl Bartos.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gnVtpbTsT7LScTuVPyP22HDhjP9.jpg", "actors": ["Dan O'Bannon (Himself)", "Enki Bilal ()", "Philippe Druillet ()", "H.R.
