When gold and platinum-group metals are transformed into the monatomic state, a fine white powder is produced.  This substance was used by pharaohs and kings of the ancient world. It was also part of the secret knowledge of mediaeval alchemy and the Knights Templar.  Research on this has been forging ahead, and some amazing properties of high-spin monatomic elements have now been scientifically confirmed. This has huge and potentially revolutionary implications.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
