She is now an old lady, and Andalusia has long since become Europe\u2019s vegetable plantation, with 90% of the sweet peppers in our supermarkets coming from the so-called plastic coast. It\u2019s a lucrative business \u2013 but not for the farmers of San Agust\u00edn, whose share of profits is miniscule. This results in many of them taking on cheap labour from illegal African immigrants. A mysterious virus that threatens to destroy the crop further compounds the situation \u2013 with the affair dubbed the \u201ccucumber crisis\u201d. In this portrayal of a village and its people, three filmmakers highlight in nine chapters the deeper workings of industrialised agriculture \u2013 presenting another side to Southern Spain, far from its image as a beach filled, party Mecca. Like the holiday industry, vegetable growing receives criticism for its excessive exaggeration. But who are the real black sheep?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
