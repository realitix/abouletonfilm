It doesn't matter that the pair seems mismatched because Jack doesn't really exist; he is a figment of Nellie\u2019s imagination--someone she dreamed up out of bits and pieces of Leonard, a somewhat bland man with whom she had a blind date months earlier. Meanwhile, we meet Leonard, and learn that he too has an imaginary lover, whom he has fashioned after the attractive attributes of Nellie. When the two characters come together again, they are forced to compare and contrast their ideal\u2014but, sadly, nonexistent--partners, with their flesh and blood counterparts. The question is, will Nellie choose the man on her mind over the man in her arms?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7hEpDEJpUDLO9Y1p1w8q2e9pX2T.jpg", "actors": ["Amy McAllister ()", "Georgia Mackenzie ()", "Shane Attwooll ()", "Samuel James ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
