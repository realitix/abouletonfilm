Although the ringmaster thinks he is too young to perform, Half-Pint cannot resist the applause of the crowd, and is continually turning up in the center-ring in impromptu acts which are not part of the circus-manager's plan. He joins the band making music with his trunk; performs as a unicycle artist, and generally disrupts the execution of the show.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
