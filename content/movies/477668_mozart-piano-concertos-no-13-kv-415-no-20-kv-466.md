Uchida's pianistic clarity and incision, and her unforced identification with the music, equates to the sort of playing that makes one listen to seemingly familiar music with fresh ears and to appreciate how an artist, even one as individual as Uchida, can search music but not dominate it . . . With crisp, well-balanced sound . . . this is a recommendable release", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8glBcL3AYGt6LGiXJD65JL8PWvd.jpg", "actors": ["Mitsuko Uchida ()", "Salzburg Camerata ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
