Blue paint starts to issue from the projected image, until the room is filled with paint and the distinction between room, image and seascape is lost, to dizzying effect. The relationship between the projected image and its painted representation, the negative and positive space within the projected film and the room in which the film is projected shifts constantly throughout the film like the infinite variations of waves in the sea.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jBVt3j1fO1Q5aeoLrVoVAdZXWED.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
