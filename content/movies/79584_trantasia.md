About 20 women arrive for all-night rehearsals and the pageant itself: swimsuit, evening gown, and talent competition, the selection of eight finalists and three prize winners. We follow the women backstage and get in-depth profiles of six: two from Chicago and one each from LA, San Francisco, San Antonio, and Columbia, South Carolina. We meet their families, and we learn about their lives and their journeys of self-discovery and acceptance", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rIrg4CMhTvG7e2IxlW3XtJNly2U.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
