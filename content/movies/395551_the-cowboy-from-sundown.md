Then, Sheriff Tex Rockett is forced to quarantine all the cattle on the local ranches because of a hoof-and-mouth disease outbreak. Steve Davis herds his cattle to the railhead anyway, and Tex is forced to arrest him. Urged on by the banker's son, Nick Cuttler, the angry ranchers storm the jail, but Steve's sister Bee persuades them to await the trial. Steve, with Nick's help, breaks jail and is told he must kill Tex to aid the ranchers. Meanwhile, government man Bret Stockton and Tex see Nick and his men treating cattle in an unusual way. Tex finally proves that the Cuttlers have been treating the cattle with acid to give a false impression of the hoof-and-mouth disease.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bj2RuZYFrekisTn5dBZQIMKHDdb.jpg", "actors": ["Tex Ritter (Sheriff Tex Rockett)", "Roscoe Ates (Deputy Gloomy Day)", "Carleton Young (Nick Cuttler)", "George Pembroke (Cylus Cuttler)", "Patsy Moran (Prunella Wallaby)", "Pauline Haddon (Bee Davis)", "Glenn Strange (Bret Stockton)", "Slim Andrews (Judge Hank Pritchard)", "Bud Osborne (Pronto Parsons)", "Joe McGuinn (Rip Carter)", "Dave O'Brien (Steve Davis)", "Chick Hannan (Henchman Pete)", "Victor Adamson (Cowhand)", "Gene Alsace (Cattle Buyer)", "Nora Bush (Townswoman)", "James Farrar (Clerk)", "White Flash (Tex's Horse)", "Cactus Mack (Mob Member)", "Fox O'Callahan (Cowhand)", "Doye O'Dell  (Cowhand Musician)", "Tex Palmer (Carter Cowhand)", "Rose Plumer (Townswoman)", "James Sheridan (Davis Cowhand)", "Wally West (Cowhand)", "Tris Coffin (Ben Varco)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
