India.Arie\u2019s music is rich, involving and highly spiritual. The guitar plays a huge part in her music, with two supporting guitarists accompanying Arie and her guitar. The raw percussion sound strongly backs up the powerful lyrical quality of this artist, and rich harmonies stream from the songs with so much emotion and heart.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aIzQACr2GsWdZyt1gmrj3t0JW5c.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
