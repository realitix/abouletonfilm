Having paved the way for many alternative bands in the 90s, and proving once and for all that rock and politics do mix, the band decided to quit while they were ahead. Fortunately a camera crew were on hand to capture the action from their emotional farewell shows, providing an intense document of the final hours of the band. All the groups hits are present, including 'Bombtrack', 'Bulls on Parade', 'Killing In The Name', and many more.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9746OgQv2R5yPlkr7cUUrZThwy1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
