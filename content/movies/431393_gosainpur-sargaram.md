Everyone in the village knows that father and the son are at loggerheads. Shyamlal is also an eccentric who eschews anything modern. Then, instead of Syamlal, his son Jiban Mallick is killed and the wealth of Mallick's looted. Oddly though, the dead body of Jiban Mallick vanishes, only to reappear again. Feluda works this out with a mixture of investigating skills and deception.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hbfX79HHA070xpbKSUXyvzVRn2Y.jpg", "actors": ["Sabyasachi Chakraborty (Feluda)", "Saswata Chatterjee (Topshe)", "Satya Bannerjee (Tulsicharan Dasgupta)", "Rabi Ghosh (Jatayu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
