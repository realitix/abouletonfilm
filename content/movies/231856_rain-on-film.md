What follows is the funny, touching, and somewhat cinematic consequences of her vision. Rain on Film is a bittersweet love story which explores the ways in which cinema can construct and skew our perspective of what love and romance really are.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yMxMrDunycEyPx7uonl88LXazcX.jpg", "actors": ["Josie Long (Josie)", "Rupert Hill (Dan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
