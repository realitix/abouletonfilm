In this film, she speaks frankly about her career, the craft of her immensely varied work, and the immediate, personal themes with which she engages: autobiography, memory, desire, and identity.  Many of her best-known works, including Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963-1995 (1995) and My Bed (1998), are illustrated and discussed, as is a wide selection of drawings, prints, paintings, neons, appliqu\u00e9 blankets and installations.  Please note that this video contains explicit images and adult language featured in artworks by Tracey Emin.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5DH4V7wWdzC2v9vBtAtMRA9b8gZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
