United Artists Records came to Walter Shenson, asking him to produce a movie so UA could issue a soundtrack album. Shenson signed Lester to direct, and they got the Beatles to agree to star. Shenson sent Owen to Dublin to spend time with the Fab Four; from this came a script built around their being prisoners of their own success. Phil Collins, himself an extra on A Hard Day's Night, hosts this examination of a seminal film: what was ad-libbed, why was it a hit, what was its influence on other movies, and how did it define the way the public viewed each Beatle for years to come?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cr25TDLEIJLIZUzc1Ec3t4I9oGf.jpg", "actors": ["Paul McCartney (Himself)", "John Lennon (Himself)", "Ringo Starr (Himself)", "George Harrison (Himself)", "Phil Collins (Host)", "Roger Ebert (Host)", "Peter Noone (Himself)", "Roger McGuinn (Himself)", "Victor Spinetti (Himself)", "Micky Dolenz (Himself)", "Richard Lester (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
