With the unexpected death of both parents, the sisters are left to keep this dying farm out of foreclosure. But when Nancy finds that her sister\u2019s commitment is not nearly as strong as her own, the inequality of labour causes tensions to rise, and Nancy\u2019s conviction to keep the farm could cost her everything, including her family. In this powerful film on the peril faced by America\u2019s farmers, Emmy-winning filmmaker Morgan Schmidt-Feng (The Next Frontier) presents a passionate tale of one woman\u2019s commitment to duty, family, legacy and the lengths she will go to keep it all together. - Heather Haynes (Hot Docs)", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
