During the Reagan years, the films get gorier, budgets get smaller, and their appeal wanes. Then, \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" revives the genre. Jump to the late 90s, when \"Scream\" brings humor and TV stars into the mix. Although some criticize the genre as misogynistic (Siskel and Ebert), most of the talking heads celebrate the films: as long as there are teenagers, there will be slasher films, says one.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2GgTkZg2UVwCp1fapPWiNhiH07g.jpg", "actors": ["Ed Green (Narrator)", "John Carpenter (Himself)", "Rob Zombie (Himself)", "Lilyan Chauvin (Herself)", "Betsy Palmer (Herself)", "Malek Akkad (Himself)", "Wes Craven (Himself)", "Sean S.
