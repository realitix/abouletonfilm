Magnets have the power to attract and repel\u2014sometimes on a massive scale. The Earth\u2019s molten core\u2014a violent mix of searing heat, crushing pressure, and a billion trillion tons of liquid iron\u2014creates an invisible shield that surrounds the globe, guarding against a constant barrage of deadly radiation from space. But over the last few decades, the Earth\u2019s magnetic field has weakened dramatically, intriguing scientists across the globe. The power generated 2000 miles beneath our feet protects us every day, but the loss of Earth\u2019s magnetic field is a brewing storm that affects us all. While experts research and debate, persistent questions remain. Is a rare geomagnetic reversal the cause of earth\u2019s inner turmoil? And if the magnetic field were to vanish altogether, would Earth become as lifeless as Mars?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Agztjq7cPm8lLeshKFbXPC1GaCO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
