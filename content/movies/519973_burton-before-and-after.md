In the wake of greater transgender awareness in the dominant culture, Courtney proposes that they go on-camera to revisit the old footage together. Burton worries about outing himself to co-workers who are unaware of his gender reassignment and declines Courtney's proposition. But after the election of the 45th President of the United States, Burton changes his mind and his fear is no longer as important as his truth.  Burton Before and After is an intimate portrait of transition, memory, and friendship.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/odGlAsS4xOp0QUbgJnFxauFLgW1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
