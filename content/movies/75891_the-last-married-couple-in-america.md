Although their marriage is not perfect, they are seemingly happy in their married and family life. But all their married friends seem to be getting divorced or separated. These newly single friends try to convince both Jeff and Mari - together and individually - that divorce is the way to go. Even if they do decide to remarry, it will be an inevitability that that marriage too will end in divorce. And divorce can even re-energize the love in an otherwise stale marriage. In light of these assertions by their friends, Jeff and Mari do evaluate their marriage. Their friends also place each of them in potentially compromising positions, despite the fact that they still are married. Will Jeff and Mari's marriage be able to withstand all this outside pressure?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sa9P5NsIqYYGHVQol8aDRyxtTyE.jpg", "actors": ["George Segal (Jeff Thompson)", "Natalie Wood (Mari Thompson)", "Richard Benjamin (Marv Cooper)", "Valerie Harper (Barbara)", "Bob Dishy (Howard)", "Dom DeLuise (Walter Holmes)", "Marilyn Sokol (Alice Squib)", "Priscilla Barnes (Helena Dryden)", "Oliver Clark (Max Dryden)", "Mark Lonow (Tom)", "Allan Arbus (Al Squib)", "Arlene Golonka (Sally Cooper)", "Sondra Currie (Lainy)", "Robert Wahler (Rick)", "Catherine Hickland (Rebecca)", "David Comfort (Dick Thompson)", "David Rode (Andy Thompson)", "Rick Segall (Charlie Thompson)", "Stewart Moss (Donald)", "Colby Chester (Reggie)", "William Bogert (Dancing Man at First Party)", "Bebe Drake (Policewoman)", "Murphy Dunne (Dr. Schallert)", "Jan Jorden (Woman at Soccer Game)", "Edgy Lee (Liu)", "Jenny O'Hara (Dancing Lady at First Party)", "George Pentecost (Roy)", "Charlene Ryan (Oriana)", "Shari Summers (Maggie)", "Yvonne Wilder (Margrette)", "Delia Salvi (Bel Air Woman)", "Mieko Kobayashi (Carol)", "Billy Holms (Dave)", "David Bennett (Ralph)", "Robert Perault (Young Man at Restaurant)", "Brad Maule (Young Man at Restaurant)", "Vernon Weddle (Man at Soccer Game)", "G.
