He has his mistress and servant-slave, Aiche, , on the ship, and the ships doctor, Corot, has his eye on Aiche. The slaves, under the leadership of warrior Tamango, plot a revolt, the moment they are herded on board. Corot convinces Aiche that Reinke never intends to marry her or set her free, and is going to marry a Dutch girl. Aiche joins with Tamango in the revolt. When the situation becomes a stalemate, Reinke orders a cannon fired into the hold of the ship, where the blacks are barricaded with stolen arms.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tw4amtKQxTWgMEYDUala7hY23Ca.jpg", "actors": ["Dorothy Dandridge (Aich\u00e9, Reiker's mistress)", "Curd J\u00fcrgens (Captain John Reiker)", "Alex Cressan (Tamango)", "Jean Servais (Dr. Corot)", "Roger Hanin (Bebe)", "Guy Mairesse (Werner)", "Cl\u00e9ment Harari (Cook)", "Doudou Babet (Chadi)", "Bachir Tour\u00e9 (Zaru)", "Julien Verdier (Fernando)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
