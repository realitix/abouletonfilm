One day when his friend, Ali, shows him the contents of a lost purse, Hussein discovers a receipt of payment and cannot believe the large sum of money someone spent to purchase an expensive necklace. He knows that his pitiful salary will never be enough to afford such luxury. Hussein receives yet another blow when he and Ali are denied entry to an uptown jewelry store because of their appearance. His job allows him a full view of the contrast between rich and poor. He motorbikes every evening to neighborhoods he will never live in, for a closer look at what goes on behind closed doors. But one night, Hussein tastes the luxurious life, before his deep feelings of humiliation push him over the edge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6vWpymavFJUupvbqHtEoE5DFVfl.jpg", "actors": ["Hossain Emadeddin (Hussein)", "Kamyar Sheisi (Ali)", "Azita Rayeji (The Bride)", "Shahram Vaziri (The Jeweler)", "Ehsan Amani (The Man in the Tea House)", "Pourang Nakhael (The Rich Man)", "Kaveh Najmabadi (The Seller)", "Saber Safael (The Soldier)", "Yadollah Samadian ()", "Ramin Rastad ()", "Mehran Rajabi ()", "Behnaz Houri ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [42206, 175473, 176298, 190309], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
