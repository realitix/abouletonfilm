Tracing its effective use by religious figures, politicians and marketers, director Larry Weinstein crafts a persuasive study of the mechanics behind propaganda. This fascinating investigation confronts us with timely questions: If we grow up surrounded by propaganda, how do we know what is true? What risks are inherited by a society tricked into their perceptions? Freedom of speech is critical to a democracy's survival, yet demagogues have consistently exploited that freedom to coerce willing supporters. Contemporary artists, including Kent Monkman, Shepard Fairey and Ai Weiwei, analyze their politically motivated work, creatively co-opting the conventions of disinformation that have permeated their respective cultures. As our platforms for spreading ideas continue to expand in a digital age, dangerous lies have never been better disguised.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dZGrPJy3FtIezdwcklZN8cSEf3w.jpg", "actors": ["Ai Weiwei ()", "Shepard Fairey ()", "Kent Monkman ()", "Jean Seaton ()", "Sabo ()", "Rebecca Goldstein ()", "Alistair Pike ()", "Astra Taylor ()", "Barry Blitt ()", "Christiane Gruber ()", "Colin Moore ()", "Craig Silverman ()", "David Walmsley ()", "David Welch ()", "Edward Jones-Imhotep ()", "G\u00e9rard Biard ()", "Eike Schmidt ()", "Jim Fitzpatrick ()", "Jonas Staal ()", "Morten Traavik ()", "Norman Lloyd ()", "Paolo Granata ()", "Tyler Shields ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
