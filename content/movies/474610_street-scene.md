The story focuses on two plotlines: the romance between Rose Maurrant and her neighbor Sam Kaplan; and on the extramarital affair of Rose's mother, Anna, which is eventually discovered by Rose's irritable father, Frank. The show portrays the ordinary romances, squabbles and gossips of the neighbors, as the mounting tensions involving the Maurrant family eventually build into a tragedy of epic proportions.  Broadcast on BBC Two on New Years Day, 1993, this production was performed by the English National Opera and conducted by James Holmes.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Janice Cairns (Anna Maurrant)", "Lesley Garrett (Rose Maurrant)", "Kevin Anderson (Sam Kaplan)", "Mark Richardson (Frank Maurrant)", "Daniel Ison (Willie Maurrant)", "Terry Jenkins (Abraham Kaplan)", "Richard Halton (Harry Easter)", "Keel Watson (Henry Davis)", "Philip Gould (Dick McGann)", "Caroline O'Connor (Mae Jones)", "Anthony Mee (Lippo Fiorentino)", "Christine Bunning (Greta Fiorentino)", "Meriel Dickinson (Emma Jones)", "Shelagh Squires (Olga Olsen)", "Harry Nicoll (Daniel Buchanan)", "Yvette Bonner (Jennie Hildebrand)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
