Loosely related to Surrealism and Pop Art, Porter\u2019s lyrical film reanimates found objects, toys, and figurines that the artist purchased from antique stores and flea markets. The artist manipulates kitsch in ways that call attention to the artifice and ridiculousness of such objects as essentially useless materials.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
