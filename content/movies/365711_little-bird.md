It goes away when instead of playing football with other kids you sit down and silently contemplate the river. When your thoughts don\u2019t let you sleep, and a lightning bug beats in a pot like a heart. When poems come into your mind and you feel you really need to sing. It goes away when you suddenly realize: this summer is going away and it is the last summer of your childhood.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m59vF5N5YQPcZaNM24HndJSU7g0.jpg", "actors": ["Matvey Ivanov (Dima)", "Alexandra Rybakova (Lenta)", "Timofey Shubin (Kid)", "Margarita Tolstoganova (Rita)", "Petr Skvortsov (Pasha)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "fDcls_Rr-V8"}
