Through long and extremely detailed flashbacks, Lacey tells the story about the murderous spirit in the little piece of mirror to befriended actress and her husband director (played by Ulli Lommel himself, with his atrocious German accent). Naturally they want to exploit Lacey's bizarre thriller story and turn it into a horror movie, but then the Boogeyman returns to kill them all during a typical Hollywood pool party. \"Boogeyman II\" is 50 minutes of stock footage and 25 minutes of non-stop new murders.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oms2rGJ1PCAioZAEJdGQOljU0jU.jpg", "actors": ["Suzanna Love (Lacey)", "Ulli Lommel (Mickey Lombard)", "Shannah Hall (Bonnie Lombard)", "Shoto von Douglas (Joseph)", "Bob Rosenfarb (Bernie)", "Rhonda Aldrich (Cynthia)", "Sarah Jean Watkins (Kathy)", "Rock Mackenzie (Jim)", "John Carradine (Dr. Warren (archive footage))", "Leslie Smith (Sally, Miss Arizona 1979)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [156310, 27566, 85189, 84372], "youtube_key": "Xtw8RFT4f9A"}
