Mainly, his job is to help four mentally challenged men live regular lives in a home. They consist of: Norman, who works at a donut shop and has a thing for keys; Barry, who thinks he is a golf pro and doesn't communicate well with his father; Arnold, who is into all things Russian and has a habit of spending money; and Lucien, who is into Spider Man and must testify before the state senate. Jack wants to help them, but he also thinks it is time to move on with his life. The hard part is trying to say goodbye to the guys he cares about.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xsBAwcqJJQpt48TN9r7OfW60gJH.jpg", "actors": ["Nathan Lane (Norman Bulansky)", "Robert Sean Leonard (Barry Klemper)", "Tony Goldwyn (Jack Palmer)", "Michael Jeter (Arnold Wiggins)", "Courtney B.
