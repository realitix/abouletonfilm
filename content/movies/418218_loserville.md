Chuck must face the challenges that he and friends are growing apart; that his mother has decided to date a much younger man who just happens to be the school's gym teacher; and that his dream girl the brilliant, beautiful and popular Melissa Mercer barely acknowledges his existence. His plan to capture Melissa's heart once and for all by befriending her younger sister, Mary, is complicated by the fact that a viral video of Mary is the talk of the school. Featuring an ensemble of funny, flawed, and lovable characters who collide in a romantic, comic cocktail that turns every teen stereotype you think you know on its head.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pxRo59xninZYeYOLASBj3iFJdMg.jpg", "actors": ["Jamie-Lynn Sigler ()", "Jonathan Lipnicki ()", "Matt McGorry ()", "Darby Stanchfield ()", "Natalie Hall ()", "Zuzanna Szadkowski ()", "Katie McClellan ()", "Brendan Dooling ()", "Nick Fink ()", "Lily Mae Harrington ()", "Chris Bellant ()", "Chris Bellant ()", "Kathleen Littlefield (Miss Chase, Debate Judge)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "_Wg9hU20USY"}
