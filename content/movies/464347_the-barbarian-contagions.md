Why have sex and religion come to replace the plague as our number one collective fear? Set in a folkloristic alpine background, Les contagions barbares is a whirlwind of questions that a child might ask. Through a melting pot of images and video extracts, folk music, medieval archives and handmade drawings, the childlike voiceover narrator embarks us on a journey where gender, sexuality and systemic violence collide with history, tradition, family taboos and even a Bobsleigh race.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
