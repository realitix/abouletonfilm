Not even Martin Lawrence who I usually find hilar is funny.\r\n\r\n Some scenes were okay (the battle rap scene stood out the most, the only scene I thoroughly enjoyed) but overall nah. A pretty tame comedy, and too much focus came to thinking about how Kid's eraser head hair do looked for me.\r\n\r\nWatch 'HANGIN WITH THE HOMEBOYS' with Doug E Doug and John Leguizamo instead, or 'FRIDAY' with Cube or yeah why not 'CLASS ACT'."}], "recommandations_id": [16096, 30963, 16097, 28121]}
