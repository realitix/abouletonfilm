He was a human being in animal guise. The story begins in R\u00e9 Valley, which lies like a yawning gap between mountains, long and flat with borders of forests so dark that they look as though part of the blackness of night lingered in them. A river moves sluggishly along the bottom of the valley, making its way slowly and carefully between stretches of light-red sand. It runs northwards, a rare thing in Norway.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nKFBvw9CGvX0AgViXp1krVhBkfA.jpg", "actors": ["Tryggve Larssen (Sjur Renna 'Gaupa')", "Bengt Djurberg (Hans Trefothaugen)", "Julie Lampe (Turi Trefothaugen, mor til Hans)", "Tove Tellback (Ingrid Rustebakke)", "Harald Stormoen (Hallstein Rustebakke, storbonde)", "Einar Tveito (Gunnar Sl\u00f8vika, hestehandler)", "Egil Hjorth-Jenssen (T\u00f8lleiv, tjenestegutt p\u00e5 Rustbakke)", "Mimi Kihle (Bellina, danser)", "Hauk Aabel (Piper, direkt\u00f8r)", "Nils Ar\u00e9hn (P.
