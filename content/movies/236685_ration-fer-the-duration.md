He berates them for wasting time, and tells them the story of Jack and the Beanstalk, which inspires them to plant beans. Popeye falls asleep, and dreams up a giant beanstalk. His nephews talk him into climbing to the top. Inside the giant's castle, Popee hides in the cuckoo clock and spots the giant hoarding sugar instead of gold; his hen lays tires, and his storehouses are full of other goods that were rationed in World War II. Popeye tries to walk out with a stack of tires, but the giant stops him, ultimately swatting him with a fly swatter and making him into a sandwich; the giant sprinkles Popeye with pepper, delaying the inevitable spinach briefly. Popeye defeats the giant, and gets him to sneeze all his tires into a carpet.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mP7uRjCwot7bIvFOvbg2CzvdSfB.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Mercer (Popeye)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
