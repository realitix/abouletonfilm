This one was rather boring and unoriginal. I didn't find it particularly scary and instead of it being a creep ghost movie, it sorta turns into an annoying torture-fest by the end. Poorly developed characters and a lack of scares, along with lackluster atmosphere means I'll give it 5/10 stars. It would be lower but I gave it a bonus star just cuz I like Miss Pugh."}, {"pseudo": "Gimly", "content": "Malevolent did not capture my attention at all.
