The work involved extensive travel around the United States, and poses an examination of just what America is/was, or what do we mean when we speak of it. Done in a series of radically different sections which collide with each other in a manner intended to provoke thinking, Plain Talk, which was made by an American and intended for American viewers, was indeed broadcast in Britain, but somewhat predictably, not in the USA.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/db7rz0CyzSpkA38K8i5FbiO3tiK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
