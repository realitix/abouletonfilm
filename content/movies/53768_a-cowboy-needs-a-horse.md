After he gets the basics, as outlined in the title song, he's attacked by Indians. He runs out of bullets and manages to lasso them. He smokes the peace pipe with their chief. A robber is holding up a stagecoach and he rides to the rescue, refusing the reward. He also saves a train from a dynamited bridge, and a girl tied to a cactus, before riding into the sunset (and back to his suburban bed).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ebaNvmgC743gOiKt4XEO9LKa5Z.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [164954, 64593, 205874], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
