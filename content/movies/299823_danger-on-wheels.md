Lucky Taylor, a stunt driver, is initially blamed for the accident, but is later cleared. He thinks the engine design has a real chance to win races, but the racing association has banned it since the accident. He devises a scheme to have a car equipped with the engine entered into a race, without race officials-- or the engine designer's sassy daughter -- finding out about it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vRaeE7VQI6NfYcpxTQnU5uzY0kQ.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Arlen (\"Lucky\" Larry Taylor)", "Andy Devine ('Guppy' Wexel)", "Peggy Moran (Patricia \"Pat\" O'Shea)", "Vinton Hayworth (Bruce Crowley (as Jack Arnold))", "Herbert Corthell (Pop O'Shea)", "Harry C.
