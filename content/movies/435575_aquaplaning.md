Escaping from his unpleasant landlord and his lover Patrizia (a very young Martina Gedeck), he soon starts to live at the baths, and as swimmers disappear and the baths are closed for the winter, he turns the grounds into his own, perfect refuge from civilisation and social pressure, becoming increasingly detached from reality. What may sound like an annoyingly gimmicky premise is executed here playfully, yet with admirable simplicity and a subtle, unpretentious poetic sensibility that one would wish for more often in contemporary German cinema.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nhg9xi4Uky7OLJhZSM7uE3SBTVU.jpg", "actors": ["Imke Barnstedt ()", "Dominik Bender ()", "Barbara Beutler ()", "Sebastian Bleisch ()", "Gerd B\u00f6s ()", "Martina Gedeck ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
