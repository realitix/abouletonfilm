These are their stories as recollected by Sheldon 25 years after the bar closed its doors for good in 1982. Last Call examines a broad swath of the bar's clientele, some of them regulars, some of them one-offs and uncovers these never-before-heard stories of a bar community that would otherwise be forgotten.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wgCJL025GTYW9gZZ00ge0w1ntyf.jpg", "actors": ["Sheldon Nadelman (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
