The only problem is that the latter is an expert fighter and survivalist.\r\n\r\nThis is a well done revenge Western with spectacular and varied remote Western locations (detailed below). If you thought Brosnan was a pretty boy as James Bond this movie will change your mind as he\u2019s virtually unrecognizable as the skilled Rambo-like militarist. The tone is similar to contemporaneous Westerns like \u201cThe Missing\u201d (2003) and \u201cSeptember Dawn\u201d (2007), but with a revenge-chase plot. The final act throws in supernatural elements with characters like Mr. Charon (Wes Studi) and Louise C. Fair (Angelica Huston). You don\u2019t have to think too hard to figure out who they really are. \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 55 minutes and was shot in Oregon (McKenzie River, Sahalie Falls and Koosah Falls), New Mexico (Lordsburg, Taos, Bramlett and Santa Fe), Arizona (Willcox Playa, Pirtleville, San Bernardino Valley and Chiricahua National Monument) and Death Valley National Park, California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-"}], "recommandations_id": [2055, 7873, 16608, 12690], "youtube_key": "VBM6qxWc8os"}
