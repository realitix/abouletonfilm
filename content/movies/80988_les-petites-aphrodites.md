Nomadic shepherds, plagued by drought, happen on a fishing encampment with plentiful fresh water. The local men are away but will return when it rains; the shepherds stay to refresh their flock until the rain comes. A shepherd lad and a local girl, both on the verge of puberty, start a mating dance. Also, one of the shepherds approaches a beautiful local woman, inviting her to sleep with him. How will she respond? She's married, her husband at sea for the week. Is love forever or temporary?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/67eUvfaVu22VPcIaxBeqg8cet4E.jpg", "actors": ["Eleni Prokopiou (Arta)", "Takis Emmanuel (Tsakalos)", "Kleopatra Rota (Chloe)", "Vangelis Ioannidis (Skymnos)", "Zannino (Molossos)", "Anestis Vlahos (Erster Hirte)", "Kostas Papakonstantinou (Lykas)", "Stathis Giallelis ()", "Vasilis Kailas ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [269963, 125344, 183005, 386435], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
