Just add Ice.\" clearly shows how logical this movie is. I know, I was expecting this as I started watching but the real reason behind me chicking on it was it hilarity and comic value, in this regard it didn't disappoint. So many elements not to be missed, his swarve sophistication, dayglo pants and bike allow him to bypass the laws of physics entirely when jumping fences, cars and entering buildings. His high class vocabulary never stops, mumling phrases in wanna-be rap gibberish \"Yo-yo, whatsup?\", \"sex me up\", \"you know, the chick that drives the horse\" and the ever famous \"drop that zero, get with the hero\". Everywhere he goes he just oozes coolness into the situation, strutting on stage indoors at night wearing sun glasses rapping away then dry humping the girl he's been stalking who is obviously still concussed from being thrown from a horse earlier due to his antics. This movie cost 6 Million dollars to make in 1991 (today in 2015 that figure would be close to 11 million), most of this of course went on his 1 million salary and 4.9 Million on his clothing and general wardrobe/props leaving the rest for its awesome production values. Watch this film though, its funny in a way that it was never intended, totally trashed the directors reputation for 8 years after and it was pulled from the cinema after 3 weeks. Its the E.T game in movie form"}], "recommandations_id": [70500, 27408, 42493, 104334]}
