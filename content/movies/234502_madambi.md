He is a man with diverse qualities. Basically he is a moneylender, but not the avaricious kind. He lends money at very low interest-rates but makes it a point to get his money back on the date agreed upon.  The story takes a turn when a bank, named Grand Bank opens up in the village, offering to give out loans at very low interest. The manager of the bank is a young lady named Jayalakshmi. She has made her entry into the village with a very definite purpose. All this, plus the very different kind of bonding between Gopalakrishna Pillai and his mother, form the plot, which develops towards a very interesting climax.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6kBrhJUDSGdZRUdfmOkuXQa7KJR.jpg", "actors": ["Mohanlal (Puthanveetil Gopalakrishna Pillai)", "Ajmal Ameer (Puthanveetil Ramakrishna Pillai)", "Siddique (Parameswaran's eldest son)", "Mallika Kapoor (Shymala)", "KPAC Lalitha (Puthanveetil Devakiyamma)", "Kavya Madhavan (Jayalakshmi)", "Innocent (Karayogam President Divakaran)", "Jagathy Sreekumar (Advocate Mohan Kumar)", "Suraj Venjaramoodu (Keedam Vasu)", "V K Sreeraman (Parameswaran Kurup)", "Vijayakumar (Parameswaran's second son)", "Kiran Raj (Parameswaran's youngest son)", "M R Gopakumar (Raghavan)", "Kozhikode Narayanan Nair (Saghavu)", "Saikumar (Madhavan Menon)", "Krishna Prabha (Bhavani)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [198256, 105504, 338930, 234593], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
