The artist removes his eye; it falls from his hand, seeing images spin as it rolls. A man falls, objects in the studio falls on him, he's not the artist. A woman gets help from a man in a lab coat; he and the man on the floor fight over a shotgun. Outside, in the city, people and cars move backwards. On the street, those from the studio chase a woman who's stolen leeks. In the backward cityscape, they move forward. They run toward a seaside amusement park. The artist follows, his head in a bird cage. He ends up with the woman who went for help; or does he?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ailUvgxmu1Aa3yLGNJhw60n9odu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
