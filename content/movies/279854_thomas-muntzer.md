As a follower of Luther\u2032s teachings, he finds in the Bible not only reasons for clerical, but also for secular reforms. But when Luther turns away from the rural population after a discord with M\u00fcntzer, it is M\u00fcntzer who becomes the peoples\u2032 spokesman. He is forced to go to Southern Germany, where he convenes with revolting farmers. But his way leads him back to Thuringia. In 1525, he and Heinrich Pfeiffer form the centre of the Thuringian peasant uprising in M\u00fchlhausen, but their success is diminished by the fact that peasants and craftsmen don\u2032t seem to be able to work together. In Frankenhausen, M\u00fcntzer becomes the leader of a peasants\u2032 army that is set to fighting the ruler\u2032s army \u2013 and sustains a devastating loss. M\u00fcntzer is arrested and sentenced to death by decapitation for his insurgency.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lvC0nquVm1n89oSyt4aqJDT8pKv.jpg", "actors": ["Wolfgang Stumpf (Thomas M\u00fcntzer)", "Margarete Taudte (Ottilie von Gersen)", "Aribert Grimmer (Fuhrmann von Thomas M\u00fcntzer)", "Wolf Kaiser (Schwabenhannes)", "Martin Fl\u00f6rchinger (Heinrich Pfeiffer)", "Heinz Giese (Hans Buss)", "Ruth-Maria Kubitschek (B\u00e4rbel Buss)", "Albert Garbe (Bauer Barthel)", "Maly Delschaft (Frau Barthel)", "Jochen Diestelmann (Gerber Martin)", "Hans W.
