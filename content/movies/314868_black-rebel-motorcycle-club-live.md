The footage documents the end of the band s 2007 tour in support of Baby 81, their most recent full-length release. The live audio was mixed by BRMC s own Peter Hayes and the gritty cinematography keeps the band s music front and center while viewers experience the show both from the stage and from the audience s perspective.  Over ninety minutes of unadorned, intimate behind-the-scenes footage is captured on the second bonus DVD along with additional performance footage. Viewers accompany BRMC as they record songs from Howl, see the making of the Weapon of Choice video, and witness inspired, impromptu off-stage performances.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bSNnnk20WMNyJWJUto0RvBAUx2B.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
