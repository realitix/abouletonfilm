{"tmdb_id": 525377, "title": "Eva sur paysage ordinaire", "original_title": "Eva sur paysage ordinaire", "slug_title": "eva-sur-paysage-ordinaire", "date": "1984-05-20", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "In this dated, existential drama, Eva is a young and bored woman whose life never varies from day to day as she moves from home to work and back, against a constant backdrop of media commercials and ads for the 1981 presidential campaign. The continual barrage of repetitive propaganda makes her already banal existence that much worse. Although the film is competent and Eva well-interpreted, the telling of this tale needs a bit more inventiveness to sustain interest in a life that is supposed to be boring.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9p6NsD8fLp6Yz1mbL5BjwXDIGwN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
