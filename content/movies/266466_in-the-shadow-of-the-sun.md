Jarman once described film\u2019s union of light and matter as \u201can alchemical conjunction\u201d and experimented throughout his career with creating dream symbolism through the superimposition of image and action. Originally called English Apocalypse, the film\u2019s final title is derived from a 17th Century alchemical text that used the phrase as a synonym for the philosopher\u2019s stone \u2013 the highly sought substance that turns base metals into gold and silver. The film was intended as a step toward the idea of an ambient video, that like its musical counterpart, was designed to enhance an environment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6ZD4dBrsUAKcgWkqkj3pMEd9kRB.jpg", "actors": ["Karl Bowen ()", "Graham Dowie ()", "Christopher Hobbs ()", "Gerald Incandela ()", "Andrew Logan ()", "Luciana Mart\u00ednez ()", "Lucy Su ()", "Kevin Whitney ()", "Francis Wishart ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
