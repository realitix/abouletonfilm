The project is based on two coordinates. It is based on the character of Hari in Andrej Tarkovsky's film Solaris, who is now the central figure (after Nana from Jean-Luc Godard's Vivre sa Vie in X NaNa / Subroutine, and Giuliana from Il Deserto Rosso in X Love Scenes); at the same time Crash Site / My_Never_Ending_Burial_Plot represents an attempt to close the cycle of X Characters by putting a symbolic end to the lives (more accurately, the afterlife) of the film characters concerned. Whether or not this attempt is successful remains, for the time being, an open question.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
