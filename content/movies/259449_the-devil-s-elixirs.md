He wants to escape the harshness and injustice of the world and devote himself to the service of God in the quiet seclusion of a monastery. He is also hoping to forget the beautiful lady Aurelie (Jaroslava Schallerov\u00e1), whose life he saved in a flooded brook and with whom he spent an amorous night. He knows that her father would never allow her to marry him. But the devil dressed in a monk's habit and under the name Viktorin (Andrzej Kopiczynski) intervenes in Franziskus's destiny and attempts to lead him astray. To do so he first uses the diabolical elixirs kept at the monastery as a rare relic. When the young monk gets expelled from the monastery, Viktorin prepares another trap with the help of Aurelie's stepmother Euphemie (Milena Dvorsk\u00e1).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5AKp49dZDsgA9Gqy5aPMGdpMs52.jpg", "actors": ["Benjamin Besson (Franziskus)", "Jaroslava Schallerov\u00e1 (Aurelie)", "Andrzej Kopiczy\u0144ski (Viktorin)", "Milena Dvorsk\u00e1 (Euphemie)", "Maja Komorowska (Abbess)", "Fred D\u00fcren ()", "Krzysztof Chamiec ()", "Norbert Christian ()", "Radovan Lukavsk\u00fd ()", "J\u00fcrgen Kluckert ()", "Edmund Fetting ()", "Peter Dommisch ()", "Gerhard Bienert ()", "Angela Brunner ()", "Zdenka Burdov\u00e1 ()", "Petr Skarke ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
