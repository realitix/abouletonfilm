Filmmaker Evan Neel captures the events of that time along with the spirit that ties Detroit to its sports. A perfect companion piece to 2018's opening night film The Russian Five, The Joe serves as a fitting elegy for a building that housed the hopes, dreams and victories of Detroiters for three decades, and that now bows into the feted halls of sports history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wJ7c5Rt6XoXOPy5XQuUs2SvDytT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
