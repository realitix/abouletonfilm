A man with no home and no job, Paul Erd\u00f6s was the most prolific mathematician who ever lived. Born in Hungary in 1913, Erd\u00f6s wrote and co-authored over 1,500 papers and pioneered several fields in theoretical mathematics. At the age of 83 he still spent most of his time on the road, going from math meeting to math meeting, continually working on problems. He died on September 20, 1996 while attending such a meeting in Warsaw, Poland.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vwbLvnn7tw4dpGcYp4pKcvtCh4Y.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Erd\u00f6s (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [10686], "youtube_key": "_3PdSqeMEM4"}
