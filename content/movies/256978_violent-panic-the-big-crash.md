The first details the exploits of two bank robbers who specialize in \"smash and grab\" style heists. Evidently, Japanese banks of the period left huge piles of cash laying around on filing cabinets and end tables. The thieves dream of escaping Japan and going to Brazil. Charismatic lead Tsunehiko Watase gets involved with Miki Sugimoto, a strange girl with a severe mental problem. After a bank robbery goes wrong and his partner is killed, Watase is assaulted by his dead partner's thuggish brother who wants the loot.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v8nClLl0EQMfiiVeLpQaagruhQj.jpg", "actors": ["Miki Sugimoto ()", "Hideo Murota ()", "Takuz\u00f4 Kawatani ()", "Tsunehiko Watase ()", "Yayoi Watanabe ()", "Ry\u00f4 Nishida ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
