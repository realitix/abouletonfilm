The original footage, shot in 1974, was a kind of interactive, camera \u201cdance\u201d with the environment. Poetry became important when the footage was later superimposed onto its own mirror-image, to help direct the viewer away from the luring yet limited world of image-identification. \u201cI Thought There Were Limits,\u201d by Quebec poet D.G. Jones, w as used to encourage the viewer to reject Newtonian notions of space and time, and to conceptualize the film\u2019s interplay between absence, desire, and presence.
