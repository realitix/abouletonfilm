Much of the story centers upon lonely Mrs. Chen who has trouble coping with her philandering husband, and nearly senile mother-in-law. Her daughter frequently sulks and has a desperate crush on one of her teachers. Mrs. Chen's only friend is her co-worker Liu, who has fallen for a new office boy, Chou. Mrs. Chen also finds him attractive. Unfortunately for either woman, Chou is gay and plagued with problems of his own.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lfXdq7GDaUA1TH7EjGRF9FYt8k6.jpg", "actors": ["Yang Kuei-Mei ()", "Neil Peng ()", "Joy Yi-Chun Pan ()", "Pai Bing-Bing ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
