But for those new to the director\u2019s films, there\u2019s still some good material here: the commentary from Cassavetes mainstays Ben Gazzara, Gena Rowlands, Al Ruban, Seymour Cassel, and (especially) Peter Falk is predictably engaging, and the selected footage from formative early works like Shadows and Faces is revealing of a filmmaker in the process of discovering his voice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nV2QMqqj6zM6nUIQWipo91IMjEC.jpg", "actors": ["Seymour Cassel (Himself)", "Peter Falk (Himself)", "Ben Gazzara (Himself)", "Anthony Quinn (Himself)", "Gena Rowlands (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
