The former chef lives in a council flat. He has wasted his life and is now on a council job training scheme for the long-term unemployed, where he refuses to let the foreman of the activation project boss him about. When Kaj's daughter, with whom he has not been in touch for nineteen years, moves into the same council estate on the run from her violent husband, a change comes over Kaj. His initial instinct is to avoid her, but by chance he ends up helping to look after Jonas, her six-year-old son. For the first time for years Kaj need not survive on his own devices. Now he has responsibilities and a family of his own.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5bOteNFp8WsXaK44GHWGCugsotv.jpg", "actors": ["Jesper Christensen (Kaj)", "Nicolaj Kopernikus (Stig)", "Jens Albinus (Kim)", "Sarah Boberg (Connie)", "Lars Brygmann (Lars)", "John Martinus (Toiletpasser)", "Petrine Agger (Sygeplejerske)", "Anette St\u00f8velb\u00e6k (Kim's Neighbor)", "Marius Sonne Janischefska (Jonas)", "Stine Holm Joensen (Liv)", "Benjamin Boe Rasmussen (Bo)", "Lars Ranthe (Kaptajnen)", "Holger Perfort (Hr.
