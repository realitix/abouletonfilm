Colours and transparencies pose as gels and lenses until the sequence shifts, making materials behave unnaturally--mixing up insides with outsides; light with colour; time with place; left with right, forced together to prevent any physical point of contact. A filmic and sculptural enquiry into the depth and slippage between a two-dimensional field and its actual location in three-dimensional space.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bXHA4Zh8tMjRTbHFGI97Oqq3pPe.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
