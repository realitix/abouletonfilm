In their 2002 biographical documentary Georgie Girl, co-directors Peter Wells and Annie Goldson highlight the popular Member of Parliament's rapid rise through local government to prominence in the New Zealand national government.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4i39atXYg6j8JMVIHknJHnQ4BEY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
