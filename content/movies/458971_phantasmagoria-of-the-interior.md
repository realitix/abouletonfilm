JEKYLL AND MISS OSBOURNE. Utilising the materials of the complete, restored version of the film, and its French language soundtrack, the film offers a new way of looking at, understanding and appreciating Borowczyk's intensely cinematic art. Particular attention is paid to a painting by Vermeer of a pregnant woman, introduced early into Borowczyk's film, and reappearing at key moments. Beginning from this painting - its content, style, and historical background - particular aspects of the film are explored: its unusual pictorial compositions; the mingling of sexuality with violence; and the association of men and women with (respectively) open and closed spaces. The film argues that Borowczyk brings a surrealist sensibility to his free adaptation of the Jekyll and Hyde story, especially emphasizing the transgressive, revolutionary role of the free-spirited Lucy Osbourne.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j1IGFvDelNq4DwkLpF4V1NjUM2U.jpg", "actors": ["Marina Pierro (Fanny Osbourne)", "Udo Kier (Dr. Henry Jekyll)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
