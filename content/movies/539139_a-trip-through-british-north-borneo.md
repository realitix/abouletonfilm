This unique and beautiful series contains the best photographic results of two expeditions through British North Borneo. The expeditions penetrated 127 miles into the interior, some parts of which had never previously been trodden by white men, and the journey bristled with difficulties. The series illustrates not only the commercial enterprise of the British North Borneo Company, but also the quaint manners and strange customs of the natives.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
