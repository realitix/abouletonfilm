Set in Paris, the story revolves around Princess Tatiana (Irene de Zilaby) and General Mikail (Andre Lefaur), two members of the Russian nobility who'd been forced to relocate to France after the Revolution. Though the regal couple has been entrusted with the Imperial crown jewels, they'd sooner starve to death than betray the late Czar by selling the gems. As a result, they're reduced to taking jobs as servants in the home of a wealthy but somewhat zany family. Robert E. Sherwood's Americanized version of Deval's Tovaritch was filmed by Warner Bros. in 1937, with Claudette Colbert and Charles Boyer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m5pnbm1FpI7nT8iiCdRasuv6s3i.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
