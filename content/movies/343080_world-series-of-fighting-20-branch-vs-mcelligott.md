But on March 5, 2015, it was announced that Magalh\u00e3es was taken out of the tournament due to contractual problems between the World Series of Fighting and Titan Fighting Championship.  The main event was then changed to a fight between WSOF Middleweight Champion David Branch and Ronny Markes for the second semifinal fight of the WSOF Light Heavyweight Championship tournament. However, on the day of the weigh-in, Markes was forced out of the bout due to dehydration and was replaced by promotional newcomer Jesse McElligott. McElligott's original opponent, Steve Skrzat, was removed from the card entirely and paid his show and win money.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pApaYWkCiN76wArYiakLbhRihGZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
