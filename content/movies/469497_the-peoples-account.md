The most explosive was the latter, on the Broadwater Farm housing estate, which resulted in the death of PC Keith Blakelock as well as in hundreds of arrests and a number of prison sentences. The uprisings in both Brixton and Tottenham were sparked by police shootings of innocent black mothers. The People's Accoung was shot during and after the Tottenham uprising. Made by the Ceddo Film and Video Workshop, it was commissioned by Channel 4, but was never shown as the broadcaster objected to its accusations of police racism.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dZQbdKdJI3OcwCMLsDYTuke8aqR.jpg", "actors": ["Lola Young (Narrator)", "Johnathan Burn ()", "Philip Wright ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
