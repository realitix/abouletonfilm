His one out is a marker for half-ownership in a young thoroughbred, which he quickly calls in. He discovers the other owner to be a young woman from an old horse racing family who wants to protect her colt almost as much as Marty wants to rush him into big races for a fast buck. While they clash, Marty soon comes to understand the human bond with the horses and what it means to be a thoroughbred.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sHNuNLDVhoOeAqMJcK57iVb1Fhp.jpg", "actors": ["George Raft (Marty Black)", "Ellen Drew (Penelope 'Penny' Hollis)", "Hugh Herbert (Mousey Johnson)", "Zasu Pitts (Dulcey Lee)", "Louise Beavers (Aunt Tina)", "Edward Pawley (Spike Cronin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
