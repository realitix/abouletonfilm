Some bands were meant to succeed and others, despite their efforts, are destined to crash and burn, their golden dreams of musical stardom abruptly torpedoed and vanquished. Had the fickle hand of fate anointed them the career break they deserved, their story would have been an altogether different one. Tuff Luck would have been recognized as one of the leaders of the '80s hard rock scene.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vmzTiyt6CjAf2K0X7C4h5VHGHtD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
