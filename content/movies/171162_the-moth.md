Her legal guardian, a lecherous old man who has the hots for her, hires a private detective to spy on her. He tails her to a train headed for New Orleans, but she catches on to him. She befriends a young woman aboard the train and they both give the private eye the slip. What Diane doesn't know, however, is that that her newfound friend is actually a notorious criminal known as The Moth, and she has her own reasons for helping Diane escape--she, too, is being tailed by a detective, who's after a cache of jewels she's stolen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1wmmPwquuIrUlf1ZtXngsUhh2K.jpg", "actors": ["Sally O'Neil (Diana Wyman)", "Paul Page (George Duncan)", "Wilfred Lucas (John Gale)", "Fred Kelsey (Detective Blake)", "Duncan Renaldo (Don Pedro)", "Rae Daggett (Marie LeMaire aka The Moth)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
