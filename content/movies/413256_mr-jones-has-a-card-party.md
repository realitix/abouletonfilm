But Oh! the ordeal, for such it was, was telling on him, and his pent-up spirits were threatening ebullition, when at last the chance comes. The league arranges to attend a three-days' convention out of town, and when Mrs. Jones departs, Jones sends a note to Smith, telling him to bring the gang, and they would have a \"Prayer Meeting,\" enjoining him not to forget the \"fixings.\" Well, the gang are not long in putting in an appearance, for they feel that every minute's delay is a chunk lost from a golden opportunity for fun.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qiJSYXdXOaHgqyO3wV5vNvSWcae.jpg", "actors": ["John R.
