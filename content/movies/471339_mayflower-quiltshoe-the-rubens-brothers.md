Finally one week of peace! Their joy doubles when they win a rent-free summer cottage for one week. What they don't know is, that these two cottages are next to each other! When the truth comes out, the constables are forced to masquerade themselves to remain incognito. Unfortunately their alter egos, artistic Rubens brothers, become an instant hit for Mother Kattilakoski. Mayflower and Quiltshoe have instant doubts about Rubens; they must be escaped bandits instead. The girls set to prove their theory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rYZczng7wwlaEjBRGrTQxaXDE4h.jpg", "actors": ["Aku Hirviniemi (Konstaapeli Rillirousku)", "Pirjo Heikkil\u00e4 (Helga Alibullen)", "Niina Lahtinen (Hanna Kattilakoski)", "Janne Kataja (Konstaapeli Isonapa)", "Joonas Nordman (Matti Kattilakoski)", "Krisse Salminen (Halise Alibullen)", "Emily Shipway (Hein\u00e4hattu)", "Ella Kangas (Vilttitossu)", "Pekka Strang ()", "Kiti Kokkonen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
