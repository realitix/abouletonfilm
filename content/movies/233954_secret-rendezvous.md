They think nothing can mar their peaceful life but nothing is permanent in this world and Shuichi's company goes bankrupt. Shuichi feels lost. He misses the good times he had at bars and cabarets, especially Hiromi, a hostess. Nobuko offers to work while he hunts for a job and finds an opening at an advertising company. But as Nobuko makes the rounds of restaurants and cabarets, she finds she cannot get ads just by dint of hard work alone. All the shop owners and managers expect her to sleep with them for each big ad they buy. At first, Nobuko is shocked but, to eat, she must meet their demands.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rNjtpuJDGtJ5e8PJ76kpaUQ2OT7.jpg", "actors": ["Kazuko Shirakawa (Nobuko Kosaka)", "Keiko Aikawa (Hiromi)", "Eriko Oka (Aki)", "Mitsuko Aoi (Kayo Mitsumura)", "Tatsuya Hamaguchi (Shuichi Kosaka)", "Chieko Harada (Tomoko Oba)", "Ry\u00fbji \u00d4izumi (Masayuki Oba)", "Haruhiko Asaka (Shoji Senuma)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
