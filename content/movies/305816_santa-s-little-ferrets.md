In a desperate attempt to get the kids to sleep, their father tells them a homespun bedtime story, an instant Christmas classic -- the story of Santa's little ferrets. Although very few people know it, it seems that Santa brings an elite security detail with him every Christmas Eve -- three highly trained ferrets. Their job? Make sure no one's awake, trying to catch a glimpse of Santa. But on this particular night the unexpected happens, and the line between fantasy and reality becomes blurred. Suddenly, the ferrets' entire security operation is in jeopardy!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4WbGDvTYNKQqgm5Os97gxjCtvRx.jpg", "actors": ["Adam Korson (Henry Collins)", "Lisa Durupt (Claire Collins)", "Erica Tremblay (Daisy Collins)", "Jacob Tremblay (Todd Collins)", "Emma Tremblay (Elsa Collins)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
