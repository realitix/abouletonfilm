He and his wife have a young son, and everything is lined up so he can go to the reunion alone, hook up with the woman, and go home without his wife suspecting anything. Unfortunately for him, his wife's mother breaks her arm the night of the reunion and can't watch their son. Diogo scrambles to find a babysitter, ultimately settling on a nursery in a strange building. He goes to the party, meets up with the crush, but then has to leave. He and his three friends then go back to the nursery and pick up his son, who is wearing his favorite dog mask. While Diogo and his friends are on their way back to the reunion (he still hasn't hooked up with his former crush) he removes the dog mask and realizes the boy isn't his.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p5HTZiZoaaGBFjYBZFMTm1z97jo.jpg", "actors": ["Danton Mello (Diogo)", "Thogun Teixeira (Nando)", "Dani Calabresa (Julia)", "Antonio Tabet (Cezar)", "Monica Iozzi (Marina)", "Juliana Didone (Patricia Ellen)", "Martha Nowill (Marlene)", "Lukas Brombini (Luca)", "Paulinho Serra (Cleverson)", "Danilo Gentili (Policial)", "Rafinha Bastos (Gilson)", "Nicole Bahls (Namorada Cueca)", "Erik Min Soo Chung (Jaspion)", "Maur\u00edcio de Barros (Cueca)", "Otavio Fantinato (Malabarista Argentino)", "Nick Farewell (Senhor Coreano)", "Luc\u00e9lia Maquiavelli (Dona Sonia)", "Fernando Muylaert (Alco\u00f3latra)", "Gustavo Novaes (Paulo)", "Ricardo Oshiro (Kim)", "Lulu Pavarin (M\u00e3e Mariana)", "Diogo Portugal (Alco\u00f3latra)", "Luana Tanaka (Scheila)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [81722, 243451, 228185, 324465], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
