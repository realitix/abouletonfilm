Magaly got to know Fernando who was her lawyer while she languished in a Cuban prison. With his help, she managed to escape. A long time went by before they met again, in the Canary Islands. Now, attracted to each other, they make love for sure but they have also found out they hate each other's guts. Probably because Magaly likes to seduce. Fernando of course, but also a lot of others, men and... women!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/680PyYz4ipgeuvT2i6LNUTFDt78.jpg", "actors": ["Rosa Est\u00e9vez (Marga)", "Felicitas Garc\u00eda (Neli)", "Lidia Herrera (La Nati)", "Fernando Merinero (Fernando)", "Magaly Santana (Magaly)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
