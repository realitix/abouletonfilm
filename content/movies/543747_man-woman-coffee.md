Gradisca and Volpina. Mommy's boys, loose dogs, macho men and strong women. Milan, Rome, Venice, Amarcord, mi recordo, - I remember. What makes you happy? What are you afraid of? How could life have been? Throughout his childhood, the director has longed for Italy, and now he is making a journey from north to south that we can join. Italy's living room is the coffee bar, so of course we meet our everyday heroes there, some are cut out of a Fellini movie. Here we listen to hopes of lottery winnings, talks about football, but also reflect on the great existential questions about what the future can bring.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pUrbf4IWzGP9oJ2kD4Uf6Zaq15B.jpg", "actors": ["Carl E.
