Weaving emotionally compelling interviews with home movies, stock footage, and family photos, Tragos travels from Selma, Alabama, to the U.S. Senate in search of her father\u2019s Naval Academy roommates and war buddies, each of whom has been silently mourning his death and remembers her father\u2019s life in his own way. Along her journey, Tragos uncovers a 30-year-old mystery, as she comes to know her father as a man, untangled from the memory of a war that wounded a nation. And while some discoveries are almost too difficult to bear, it is ultimately the truth that allows her, and her entire family, to understand and move forward.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
