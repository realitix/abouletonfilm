Just a while ago they were at the Italian Mediterranean coast, now here they are standing at a parking lot in front of an Esso gas station, waiting for their father\u2019s car to appear around the corner. Affectionately, they bid their mother good-bye for now. The two sisters\u2019 parents are separated.
