It took place on February 15, 1998 at the Compaq Center in Houston, Texas and was presented by Western Union.  It was the first of a series of In Your House events which later became the title of annual PPVs, replacing the method at the time of making new names for all events aside from the 'Big Four' (the Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam and the Survivor Series) and King of the Ring. However, because later events did not take place in Texas, it was truncated to No Way Out and would not become a regular feature until 2000.  Shawn Michaels did not appear in the main event as advertised, owing to a severe back injury that resulted in his first retirement after the following month's WrestleMania XIV. He was replaced by Savio Vega.  The main event was an \"unsanctioned\" 8 man tag match featuring Steve Austin, Owen Hart, Cactus jack, and Chainsaw Charlie vs. HHH, Savio Vega, Billy Gunn, and Road Dogg.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rNvGjKIHJNnBIXCrWxihYfybQY9.jpg", "actors": ["Steve Austin (HHH)", "Mick Foley (Cactus Jack)", "Terry Funk (Chainsaw Charlie)", "Owen James Hart (Himself)", "Paul Michael L\u00e9vesque (Triple H)", "Juan Rivera (Savio Vega)", "Monty Kip Sopp (Bad Ass Billy Gunn)", "Brian Girard James (Road Dogg Jesse James)", "Glenn Thomas Jacobs (Kane)", "Leon Allen White (Vader)", "Ken Shamrock (Himself)", "Brian Harris (Chainz)", "Ron Harris (DOA Skull)", "Don Harris (DOA 8-Ball)", "Tony Norris (Ahmed Johnson)", "Dwayne Johnson (The Rock)", "Ron Simmons (Faarooq)", "Charles Wright (Kama Mustafa)", "Mark Henry (Himself)", "John Charles Layfield (Justin Bradshaw)", "Jeff Jarrett (Himself)", "Mark Canterbury (Henry Godwinn)", "Dennis Knight (Phineas Godwinn)", "Jacques Rougeau (Himself)", "Takao Yoshida (Taka Michinoku)", "Dustin Runnels (Goldust)", "Charles Warrington (Mosh)", "Glenn Ruth (Thrash)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "d7e8aQ_oPPY"}
