Inspired by the classic duo Tarzan and Jane (not forgetting Skippy the chimpanzee) it is a hilarious exercise in role reversal. Tarzan becomes SHAME - weak, cowardly and sexually inadequate. Jane becomes JUNE - strident, sexually demanding and naked most of the time. Skippy becomes CHEAPO, a randy primate who delights in fondling June's breasts and swinging on Shame's genitalia.  In modern terms it's the saucy adventures of the Wimp, the Chimp and the Bimbo. Featuring the voices of Johnny Weissmuller Jr, John Belushi, Bill Murray and Emily Prager", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fKNp6mC5vV6YcsOUC1VrYIUYZxR.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Murray ()", "John Belushi ()", "Johnny Weissmuller Jr. ()", "Emily Prager (June)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
