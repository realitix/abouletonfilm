You will among others meet an immigrant on skis, an African woman living in Bergen who refuses to be buried any other place than her native Tanzania, a Norwegian army recruit from Sri Lanka, an Afghan business woman and a drug-addict of Norwegian-African heritage. Welcome Home flips your assumptions of immigrants upside-down whilst being a different take on the term 'home'.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
