They are studying, watching you, you suggest, then when you least expect it they call you at night and you summon. In these cases you have to do is put on your coat, fix you pretty well the scarf and get back to them on the neck.  That's what I did. After five years of cinema I received their call.  And I'm back on track.  I dusted off a decade of cabaret. I tuned the piano again, called my pianist. We did four hours of rehearsal and then the show has been reborn alone.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bI8Jg0Hut96NlnKua2sRnTQMTB0.jpg", "actors": ["Leonardo Pieraccioni ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
