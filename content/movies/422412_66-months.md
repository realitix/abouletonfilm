Self-mutilation, alcohol, and childlike delusions mean Nigel is a vulnerable man. In the words of his social worker, \"Nigel has been abused financially, sexually, and emotionally for years.\" She's referring to the days when, while out \"in the wild,\" a man named Robbie took Nigel under his wings. He was like a father to Nigel, while at the same time absolutely unfit for the role of caregiver, especially because he couldn't keep his hands to himself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ds0r54af6WMNCN5omudYiua0MIS.jpg", "actors": ["Nigel Fletcher (Nigel Fletcher)", "Gordon Wilson (Gordon Wilson)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
