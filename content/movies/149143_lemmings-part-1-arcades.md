The first part depicts the generational gap between 1950s teenagers and their parents while the second shows this same group of characters twenty years later as they have grown up to be dysfunctional and suicidal adults. Regarded as the most significant of Haneke\u2019s early works, Lemmings contains incipient treatments of many of the themes he would later elaborate on in his theatrical features.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5wLShDUaqHOujiL3KkqB28P4ZiV.jpg", "actors": ["Regina Sattler ()", "Christian Ingomar ()", "Eva Lindner ()", "Paulus Manker ()", "Christian Spatzek ()", "Elisabeth Orth ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
