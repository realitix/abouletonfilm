The 48 minute-long runtime takes you through the illusory journey of lucid dreaming through love, struggle and choice.  Living Still is truly a sensory juggernaut but also hits with a relatable story and omnipresent themes of tough choices and standing unique in a world full of pressure and fitting in."}], "recommandations_id": []}
