It's another early example of a two-shot film along the lines of Paul's earlier film Come Along Do!. The young man plays a magician who, after completing his act, agrees to go home with the young boy from the audience who helped him perform his tricks. At the boy's home he finds a sick sister and a worried mother being threatened with eviction by her landlord.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vuAHMOZvRcoHQ9zXSFXFAS6KKr2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
