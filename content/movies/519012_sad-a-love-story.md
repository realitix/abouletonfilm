A Love Story' is a feature currently being written by Avital Ash. It follows a happy couple whose relationship falls apart when Donald Trump becomes president.  The dramedy is as much an exploration of the lingering effects of sexual assault as it is a darkly comedic look at DUT (Dating Under Trump).  Avital Ash wrote & directed this short as a chemistry test and to prove to Amir Blumenfeld that he is also a good dramatic actor. Andrew Mueller shot and voices the 'director'.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Avital Ash (Avital)", "Amir Blumenfeld (Amir)", "Andrew Mueller (Director)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
