Time passes so slow in a quiet little town of \u201cCop Land\u201d. This bulky sheriff does nothing other than controlling traffic and surrendering to his pinball addiction. When a misfire broke out in town, Freddy jumped into it with the help of Lt. Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro). This seems like a big leap of the career-stuck sheriff. Two thumbs of for Stallone for giving up his all muscles body, something is well-maintained for years and also his choice for accepting a role much different from his usual heroic/action ones. Stallone did much better in his role when compared to his acting in Get Carter or D-Tox"}, {"pseudo": "Gimly", "content": "Weird that it took me so long to watch given the cast. Look, _Cop Land_ isn't the best movie in the filmography of anybody involved, but it was a worthwhile watch, and a nice way to break up the crap horror we've been on a bender of lately.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go_."}], "recommandations_id": [9350, 9604, 9208, 2924]}
