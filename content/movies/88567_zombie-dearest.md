Given the choice between losing Deborah or living by her plan, Gus gets busy fixing up the old place. Starting with the septic tank. In a moment of desperation, he digs up the very thing he needs, a zombie who'll do anything he wants... for now, anyway. As the zombie's own desires threaten their plans, Gus and Deborah come together in a desperate struggle to get what they want, regardless of the cost. Zombie Dearest is a genre-bender that speaks to the \"living dead\" - the hunger and the horror - in all of us. It's a wild ride that's both smartly comic and deeply quirky.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mlqUw1Q69FKETQyJghXpGO7GuVU.jpg", "actors": ["David Kemker (Gus)", "Shauna Black (Deborah)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [148972, 32583, 27285, 18440], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
