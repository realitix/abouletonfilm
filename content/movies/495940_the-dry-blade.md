With intentions to launch a bloody crusade against the government, warrior Endo Tadaoki (Henry Lee) gathers his remaining men to prepare for one last honorable battle against the emperor and regain the supremacy of the samurai. As fellow warrior Kido Masahide (Vint Carmona) refuses to join the war, he and his wife are brutally murdered at the hands of Endo's blade before being robbed of their family swords. When Kido's only son (Michael Nos\u00e9) is also pressured to join Endo's forces, he instead chooses a fatal confrontation with his parents' assailant. Suffering from a rare medical condition that renders his skin allergic to water, Ken embarks on his quest to find a sword and avenge his family's death.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cPYmJje4rATZrT24M5iCIXWyFmx.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Nos\u00e9 (Ken Masahide)", "Henry Lee (Endo Tadaoki)", "Carl Joseph Schreiber (Karl Hyde)", "Ruth Fox (Beatrice Hyde)", "Connie Jo Sechrist (Matilda)", "Erin Tjoe (Mimi)", "Vint Carmona (Kido Masahide)", "Bryan Cartago (Hiyato)", "Larry Kitagawa (Man)", "Kimberly Lim (Naeko)", "Priscilla Angel\u00edc (Asako)", "Lily Tung Crystal (Noburi)", "Kirstin Nos\u00e9 (Madam)", "Martin Nos\u00e9 (John 1)", "Ronald Nos\u00e9 (John 2)", "Glenn Nos\u00e9 (John 3)", "Brian Rapaido (Endo's Guard 1)", "Jeff Rapaido (Endo's Guard 2)", "Jennifer Gelvez (Geisha 1)", "Amy Ho (Geisha 2)", "Suong Le (Geisha 3)", "Mark Menor (Brothel Guard 1)", "Brian Marquez (Brothel Guard 2)", "Ben Rao (Ninja 1)", "Ryan Keenan (Ninja 2)", "Alex Elkins (Ninja 3)", "Lucas Okuma (Ninja 4)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "cx-_CPkksgc"}
