Zachary Oberzan had a budget of $96 and used only one camera, but nothing in this one-man adaptation of First Blood (the novel that inspired Rambo) recalled the shaky, impressionistic beauty that much lo-fi filmmaking strives for. Instead, the shots were artlessly composed and always static. In fact, not a single frame was aesthetically pleasing \u2014 even the fonts were bad. But film isn\u2019t nice composition, and Oberzan \u2014 an Obie-winning thespian accustomed to performing without props or sets \u2014 realized this, masterfully utilizing pacing, editing, and sheer conviction to transform household items into helicopters and cars, and to expand his 220-sq. ft. apartment into an entire county. It was an impressive feat, especially since he played 20 different characters (and 3 dogs), sometimes 6 onscreen at a time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mCQ8B98Vs5vkqp6MiF3wYLjdhtf.jpg", "actors": ["Zachary Oberzan (Rambo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "TFnVmzsGRXI"}
