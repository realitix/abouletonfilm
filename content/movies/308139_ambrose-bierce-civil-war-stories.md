In 1890, he presented his recently published collection of Civil War Stories to novelist Gertrude Atherton and fledgling young publisher William Randolph Hearst during an infamous meeting in Sonol, California. This meeting sets the forum for the presentation of three of Bierce's most popular stories including \"One Kind Of Officer\", \"Story Of A Conscience\" and \"An Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge.\" This acclaimed collection features epic battle sequences, deeply conflicted drama and the signature \"surprise endings\" that characterized most of the short stories by Ambrose Bierce.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rpFawROEakfbqGCcCsEXs5YsxBx.jpg", "actors": ["Campbell Scott (Ambrose Bierce)", "Vivian Schilling (Gertrude Atherton)", "Nathan Darrow (William Randolph Hearst)", "T.
