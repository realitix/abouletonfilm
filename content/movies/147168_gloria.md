Frampton juxtaposes nineteenth-century concerns with contemporary forms through the interfacing of a work of early cinema with a videographic display of textual material. These two formal components (the film and the texts) in turn relate to a nineteenth-century figure, Frampton's maternal grandmother, and to a twentieth-century one, her grandson (filmmaker Frampton himself). In attempting to recapture their relationship, GLORIA! becomes a somewhat comic, often touching meditation on death, on memory and on the power of image, music and text to resurrect the past.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kf0Gy8QXz1gow11Melgcobytkfk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [383841, 285768, 152973, 150933], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
