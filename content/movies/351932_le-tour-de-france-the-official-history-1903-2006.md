As well as the triumphs we also explore the tragedies and controversies associated with the Tour, amongst them the death of two-time winner Octavia Bottachia, reputedly murdered by fascists, the death of Tommy Simpson on the Ventoux in 1967 and Fabio Casartelli's death in 1995.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iu5Sehza5ytAyYUGfu4q6vstDUs.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
