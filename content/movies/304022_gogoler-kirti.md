Gogol is in a way the younger version of Feluda who is gadget savvy, knows mob applications, has contemporary tastes and upbringing but still loves to be in a joint family and calls its members 'pisi-na kaka-didibhai-chhotomama etc. He never uses a tab but sharpens his 'magojastro'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cwhxtz22RwzEkVtd8VwBQhIaYAd.jpg", "actors": ["Ahijit Ghosh (Gogol)", "Indraneil Sengupta (Ashok Thakur)", "Locket Chatterjee (Gogol's mother)", "Saheb Chatterjee (Gogol's father)", "Biswajit Chakraborty (Roy Raja)", "Bhaswar Chattopadhyay (Rajat)", "Vikram Chatterjee (Joy / Magic Dada)", "Subhasish Mukhopadhyay (Yadab and Madhab (Double role))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
