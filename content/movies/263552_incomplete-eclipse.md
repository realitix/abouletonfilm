Now in a school for the blind, Marta keeps up her hope that she will one day see again, mainly because her mother - out of good intentions - has led her to believe that the blindness is only temporary. Before long, Marta comes to realize that her condition will last until she dies, and she begins to despair, hating her mother for giving her false hope. Only a dedicated psychologist, Dr. Mos (Oldrich Navratil) seems to have the means of retrieving Marta from her depression.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1jDK0M8UrEyM0yx9MWmw6YRimV9.jpg", "actors": ["Lucie P\u00e1tikov\u00e1 (Marta)", "Old\u0159ich Navr\u00e1til (PhDr. Mos)", "Blanka Bohdanov\u00e1 (Nurse)", "Gabriela Bestakova (Zuzana, Martina sestra)", "Michaela Ku\u0161nerov\u00e1 (Eva, Martina spolubydlic\u00ed)", "Ond\u0159ej Havelka (O\u010dn\u00ed lek\u00e1r)", "Jitka Zelenohorsk\u00e1 (Vychovatelka v intern\u00e1te)", "Ludmila Vostr\u010dilov\u00e1 (U\u010ditelka v intern\u00e1te)", "Jana B\u0159ezinov\u00e1 (Jana Rezkov\u00e1, Martina maminka)", "Otto Lackovi\u010d (Ridi\u010d n\u00e1kladn\u00edho automobilu TIR)", "Jana Radoj\u010di\u010dov\u00e1 (Zdravotn\u00ed sestra na o\u010dn\u00edm)", "Simona Sta\u0161ov\u00e1 (Zdravotn\u00ed sestra v intern\u00e1te)", "Jana Lojk\u00e1\u0161kov\u00e1 (Sestrinka)", "Elen R\u00e1dov\u00e1 ()", "Jana \u0160irok\u00e1 (U\u010ditelka)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
