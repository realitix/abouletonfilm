Tragically he was dead from the effects of drugs and alcohol by the time he was only 50 & the myths live on. But there is another side of Flynn that is less well known - his ambitions to be a serious writer and newspaper correspondent, his documentary films and his interest in the Spanish Civil War and Castro's Cuba", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zfbWl3dqLfMVWpn9nnQ0dUHgLbg.jpg", "actors": ["Christopher Lee (Narrator)", "Deirdre Flynn (Herself)", "Rory Flynn (Herself)", "Jeffrey Meyers (Himself - Biographer)", "Kathryn Medlock (Herself - Zoologist)", "Kathryn Medlock (Herself - Zoologist, Tasmanian Museum)", "Ila Andrews (Herself - School Friend)", "John Hammond Moore (Himself - Biographer)", "Lincoln Hurst (Himself - Film Historian)", "Peter Valenti (Himself - Biographer)", "Vincent Sherman (Himself - Film Director & Friend)", "Jack Marino (Himself - Actor)", "Nora Eddington (Herself - As Nora Eddington Flynn)", "Beverly Aadland (Herself)", "Kyra Pahlen (Herself)", "Christopher Stollery (Additional Voices)", "Nell Feeney (Additional Voices)", "Gary Files (Additional Voices)", "Errol Flynn (Himself (Archive footage))", "Don Knotts (Himself (Archive footage))", "Steve Allen (Himself (Archive Footage))", "Fidel Castro (Himself (Archive Footage))", "Charles Chauvel (Himself (Archive Footage))", "Lili Damita (Herself (Archive Footage))", "Patrice Wymore (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
