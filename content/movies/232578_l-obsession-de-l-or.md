Dancing safes appear and he takes bags of gold coins out of them. A woman fairy appears and she transports them to a palace. Soldiers march in and a troupe of women dancers perform. The scene changes to an area before a fountain, but everyone disappears except the artist. A rain of what appears to be fire begins to fall and he awakens back in his studio. He is desperate.
