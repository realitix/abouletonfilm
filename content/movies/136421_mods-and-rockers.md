The short film was later folded into a full-length program alongside a pair of jukebox shorts, Swinging UK and UK Swings Again, retitled Go Go Big Beat for U.S. release.  The original promotional synopsis for the film describes it as follows: \"A symbolic ultra modern coffee bar sets the scene for a girl in gold lame jeans, bolero and bootees, to start moving to the pulsating rhythms beating out from a glittering juke box. As the music becomes progressively louder and more frantic, so the dancer increases the speed of her lithe movements to keep pace with the tempo. A boy starts to dance with this red-headed dynamo of a girl, but is repelled when she accepts the advances of a second boy. The two men vie for her attentions.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gQlIGqxw5kbL3FoSDdR8lxXlUQn.jpg", "actors": ["Mick Fleetwood (Himself - drummer of The Cheynes)", "Peter Hollis (Himself - bassist of The Cheynes)", "Roger Peacock (Himself - singer of The Cheynes)", "Phil Sawyer (Himself - guitarist of The Cheynes)", "Peter Bardens (Himself - organist of The Cheynes)", "Heinz Burt ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
