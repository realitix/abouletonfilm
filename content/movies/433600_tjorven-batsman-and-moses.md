When he comes back to the Saltkr\u00e5kan island he gives the seal to Tjorven, who names it Moses. Peter Malm, a visitor who works at the Zoological Institute in Uppsala, wants to buy the seal, but Tjorven says it's not for sale. Vesterman is in need of money and tries to get the seal back, to sell it to Peter. The children have to hide the seal, so he won't find it. Pelle's rabbit Jocke and one of S\u00f6derman's lambs are found bitten to death. The dog B\u00e5tsman is accused of those evil deeds, which means that Tjorven's father has to shoot her dog. In the last minute S\u00f6derman finds out that a fox is the perpetrator. Peter Malm says he won't buy the seal. Vesterman is disappointed and the seal stays with the children.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fP8xZXp2nTh7UsgUgfa5dgem9k3.jpg", "actors": ["Maria Johansson (Tjorven Grankvist)", "Kristina J\u00e4mtmark (Stina)", "Torsten Lilliecrona (Melker Melkersson)", "Louise Edlind (Malin Melkersson)", "Bengt Eklund (Nisse Grankvist)", "Manne Gr\u00fcnberger (Vesterman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [433396, 433398, 11946, 27599], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
