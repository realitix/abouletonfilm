The film combines statements from authentic workers that were involved in the production of Yugo, archives, along with the reconstruction of different fragments from the Yugo\u2019s history which portray him both as a family and a thug\u2019s car, as a part of the great American Dream, or as a symbol of betrayed expectations. This film is a small \u2018commemorative\u2019 review of the history of an automobile that for a long time symbolised, in a jocular and veritable way, sometimes even by accident, the times in which he was manufactured.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mELmOoKVBB5ms0YqBhTfNLa8nmx.jpg", "actors": ["Zoran Miljkovi\u0107 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
