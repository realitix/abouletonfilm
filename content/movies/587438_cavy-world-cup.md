Kiki works at a cavy-groomer and is busy preparing for the world championship for the most beautiful cavy: the Cavy World Cup. Sven, the fishmonger across the street, sells fish to eat, which Kiki does not like at all. But, when all of a sudden the lights go out and the hairdryers no longer work, she has no choice but to let go of her tight schedule. Will she be able to win the World Cup, or will love win her over?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dUCgM1n5inpbbom1jOuCsUC4zCo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
