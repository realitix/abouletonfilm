Two main characters that find each other at a crucial moment. Two fearless journeys, one that begins as a childlike adventure and ends up on the other side of the country and a one-way journey, free and determined. The same destiny will inevitably bond a woman with her grandson. Without knowing it they are part of an unbreakable family circle that deeply unites them. Second opportunities will arise while individual freedom of choice will become imposing. Everything comes together to tell us: there is only one destiny, the one you choose for yourself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7458rb8sQlBATTQlulKTnOE9JvN.jpg", "actors": ["Carme Elias ()", "Omar Moya ()", "Alec Whaite ()", "Iv\u00e1n Tamayo ()", "Alberto Rowinsky ()", "Isabel Rocatti ()", "Marcos Moreno ()", "Malena Gonz\u00e1lez ()", "Beatriz V\u00e1squez ()", "Jos\u00e9 Roberto D\u00edaz ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "xMY77DqzkBY"}
