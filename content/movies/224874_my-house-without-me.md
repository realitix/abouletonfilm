An intimate story about a Pole and a German placed by war on enemy sides and their parallel lives accidentally brought together.  The film reflects on the concepts of invaders, victim, guilt and forgiveness. It confronts different experiences and their paradoxical similarities. It deals with the controversial subject of the post-war accountings. The visual narration is flowing, guided by memories and archives. Traditional documentation confronts experimental use of archival footage in the cinematic impression about displacement.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bpVSF5NkPGMCwf7IUdqwlugH3RK.jpg", "actors": ["Janina Grze\u015bkowiak (Herself)", "Annemarie Liermann (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
