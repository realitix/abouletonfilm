Music is depicted visually with the complete absence of musical instruments or voices. Directed by Makihara Eri and choreographer Dakei.  With a diverse lineup including ordinary deaf people with zero acting experience and a choreographer who performs in Japan and abroad, this film pulls out all the tops to give visual expression to music through the physical body. An aging man uses multiple sign language poems to convey the four seasons, and a girl expresses the wind amidst the rustling trees.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n505jkPcUHXLKaXux9Mpo3TsoSI.jpg", "actors": ["Chie Honma ()", "Daisuke Ikeda ()", "Karin Ikeda ()", "Fumiko Koizumi ()", "Makoto Nozaki ()", "Kazumi Sano ()", "Miho Sano ()", "Shizue Sazawa ()", "Aya Okamoto ()", "Nozomi Yamamoto ()", "Takaki Yashiro ()", "Tomomi Yokoo ()", "Akihiro Yonaiyama ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
