Feisty, street smart Lena, 18, lives in semi-penury with her hard-drinking slob of a father, Gorri\u00f3n, and hopes to escape by getting a grant to study in Portugal. Gorrion is mixed up with local drug-smuggling mafiosi, that includes Lena's godfather, Gitano, their Portugese Cachero, and the strong, silent Milio. One day, Lena returns from her job to find Gorrion badly beaten up: The gang had accused him of stealing. Lena visits the gangsters and offers to help pay off her father's debt by working for them. After Gorrion forgets to deliver Lena's grant papers, a fragile emotional bond develops between Lena and Milio. When they set off to Portugal to do a job, events start to ramble.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lJF22EFLJ964eiYqB0wvPNfd2gY.jpg", "actors": ["Manuel Manqui\u00f1a (Gorri\u00f3n)", "Marta Larralde (Lena)", "Roberto \u00c1lvarez (Milio)", "Roberto \u00c1lvarez (Cachero)", "Luis Tosar (Gitano)", "Iv\u00e1n Herm\u00e9s (Manu)", "Iv\u00e1n Herm\u00e9s (Antonio)", "Luis Zahera (Esteban)", "Carlos Kaniowsky (Fern\u00e1ndez)", "Nuria Sanz (Mariola)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
