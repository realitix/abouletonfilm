INSIDE starts with a shot of a burnt tree stump in a forest. Materials are gathered. What are the various branches, stones and pieces of grass for and what will the silent activities lead to? INSIDE slowly uncovers an act of human solidarity. The camera hovers around two boys, ramping up the tension, and is supported by an excellent soundtrack.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jHtO6pDwRARe6hSghZ1aJugTwcs.jpg", "actors": ["Fernando \u00c1lvarez Rebeil ()", "Fernando Huerta Zamacona ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
