I recommend that you begin with this DVD first and that you use this workout to wake up your muscles, invigorate your body, and build up your stamina as you gain strong fundamentals in the Method. I offer a lot of advice in the commentary throughout the workout and it is a really comprehensive overview of the Method and an excellent starting point for any level of ability.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nGGWgzvBoCRy3Jc07tRgU5Gsan7.jpg", "actors": ["Tracy Anderson (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
