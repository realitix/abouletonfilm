High school diver Ami (Masami Nagasawa) and swimmer Keisuke (Mokomichi Hayami) don't exactly get along. Their parents run rival sweets shops and Ami is long-time friends, and maybe more, with Keisuke's freestyle rival Hiroki (Tsuyoshi Abe). Over time, however, hostile words give way to hesitant attraction, leaving Ami torn between Keisuke and Hiroki. With the national championship coming up, the young swimmers are competing for more than the title, but also their hearts.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bK5zQzUj3iHvzsFG5lZDmD1pIOe.jpg", "actors": ["Masami Nagasawa (Ami Ninomiya)", "Mokomichi Hayami (Keisuke Yamato)", "Tsuyoshi Abe (Hiroki Nakanishi)", "Yui Ichikawa (Kaori Koyanagi)", "Takuya Ishida ()", "Mai Takahashi ()", "Ren Mori ()", "Manami Kurose ()", "Norito Yashima ()", "Yu Tokui ()", "Yutaka Matsushige ()", "Eri Watanabe ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
