From recreating a rather dramatic ancient Chinese alchemy accident to splitting an atom in his own home-built replica of a 1930s piece of equipment, Jem reveals how explosives work and how we have used their power throughout history. He goes underground to show how gunpowder was used in the mines of Cornwall, recreates the first test of guncotton in a quarry with dramatic results and visits a modern high explosives factory with a noble history.  Ground-breaking high speed photography makes for some startling revelations at every step of the way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nPUW74z4aiez4CZXrP590v4ipLB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
