The film follows Skoda on his nightly rides through the city, and though different characters come and go, Skoda meets a kindred spirit in the form of a teenage woman who finds her own home life equally difficult to shoulder. The two young people are gradually attracted to each other, and they end up one night in Skoda's room together. At that moment, the older woman that Skoda had been involved with opens the door and discovers his infidelity. Skoda is living in her house and driving the taxi she gave him -- her commitment was abundantly clear from the beginning. Pushed over the edge, the older woman commits suicide -- and Skoda is blamed for her death by her ex-husband. He swears to avenge her, and the hunt for Skoda begins.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kaj6rAN0CDl60zBtduyVFWwqLqs.jpg", "actors": ["Siemen R\u00fchaak (Skoda)", "Beate Finckh (Liane)", "Vera Tschechowa (Hilke)", "Karin Baal (Eva Buchholz)", "Vadim Glowna (Onkel Paul)", "Witta Pohl (Lianes Mutter Gertrud)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
