Benjamin Wilkes, an ex-psychologist who helped Manfred select redundancy candidates, is killed in the same way as Manfred, putting disgruntled ex-Brada employees in the frame, but a third slaying implicates a former patient of Wilkes, who has connections to the Stjarne family. A newly loved-up Isabelle and Pontius start to fool around whilst on surveillance, taking their eye off the ball and allowing this suspect to confront Claire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tvxMbeAkSs8dWvCmOxnsEU4S5re.jpg", "actors": ["Krister Henriksson (Kurt Wallander)", "Lena Endre (Katarina Ahsell)", "Sverrir Gudnason (Pontus)", "Nina Zanjani (Isabelle)", "Mats Bergman (Nyberg)", "Douglas Johansson (Martinsson)", "Fredrik Gunnarsson (Svartman)", "Marianne M\u00f6rck (Ebba)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [289436, 289343, 289433, 289434], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
