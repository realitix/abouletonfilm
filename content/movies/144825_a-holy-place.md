However, Kadijevic uses it only as a starting point for his own explorations into the dark side of eroticism. Gogol's story deals with Toma, a reluctant theology student who is forced to read the Psalms over an (un)dead girl for three nights in a row. All the while supernatural forces are trying to grab him from the Holy Circle drawn on the church floor. Kadijevic adapts and enriches 'Viy' by inventing a new backstory for the witch-girl and her father. The dead girl, Catherine (unwittingly killed in the prologue, while in the shape of a hag), is referred to as a 'saint' and her father is a harsh and unpleasant man. Kadijevic departs further from the original story, and introduces an excess of perversity and horror more reminiscent of the Anglo-American gothic than the milder Slavic attempts in a similar mode.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y7dXtxdMLlBKvv6YRhi02JU8Jg4.jpg", "actors": ["Dragan Jovanovi\u0107 (Pop Toma)", "Branka Puji\u0107 (Katarina)", "Aleksandar Ber\u010dek (Gospodar Zupanski)", "Mira Banjac (Gospodarica Zupanski)", "Danilo Lazovi\u0107 (Doros)", "Predrag Mileti\u0107 (Lenka)", "Maja Sablji\u0107 (Lenka)", "Rado\u0161 Baji\u0107 (Spira)", "Dragan Petrovi\u0107 (Bogoslov)", "Du\u0161an Jani\u0107ijevi\u0107 (Upravnik \u0161kole)", "Mihajlo 'Bata' Paskaljevi\u0107 ()", "Igor Pervi\u0107 (Marko Bogoslov)", "Dragan Zari\u0107 (Slikar)", "Slavoljub Plav\u0161i\u0107 'Zvonce' ()", "Dragomir Stanojevi\u0107 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [54755, 62843], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
