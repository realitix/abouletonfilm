Pays for a new rack and wants to write it off.  GF wants to be in pictures, so he puts up 1 million to get the deduction on her assets and get her off his back.  Girl is actually pretty and does have a nice rack.  Acting is poor and breaks down in spots.  If you want an R rated movie for the F word and creative breast camo, this is the movie for you.  I would give the hot chick 3 stars, the movie 1."}], "recommandations_id": [25574, 85133, 172002, 97636]}
