Despite the cutesy decor, the place is far from benign, and she and her inmates are encouraged to compete for survival while being watched over by surveillance cameras, 24/7. Presiding over the group is an authoritarian diva who speaks entirely with the voice of Kenneth Clark from the 1960s BBC series Civilisation. As she forces the women to go head-to-head in a series of demeaning tasks, Siri, with the help of fellow inmate Alexa, starts subverting the rules and soon reveals the sinister truth that underpins their world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eSrkdGBuCsJBV0GMcwI1QbGEL2s.jpg", "actors": ["Rachel Maclean ()", "Christina Gordon ()", "Colette Dalal Tchantcho ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
