Calling at Earley, Winnersh Triangle, Winnersh, Wokingham, Bracknell, Martins Heron, Ascot, Sunningdale, Virginia Water, Egham, Staines, Feltham, Twickenham, Richmond, Clapham Junction and London Waterloo. This is the service from Reading. This train is formed of eight coaches.  This busy commuter line has a minimum half hourly service throughout the day including Sundays. Almost all the trains are formed of Alstom Junipers and we follow ours from three signal boxes. Surprisingly, Wokingham signal box is still operated from a traditional lever frame. Our train is then passed to Feltham power 'box. From Richmond, control passes to Wimbledon PSB which takes our train all the way into Waterloo.  This Driver's eye view was filmed in the summer sunshine of 2013.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/li8uD3kfxGDfbEza3CYavgqjrEY.jpg", "actors": ["Rob Curling (Narrator (Voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
