Fai is married with two sons, Pat is engaged to an older Japanese man, Pom and Nim, still hopelessly single. At one of their frequent dinners out, Pang introduces her friends to Kong, a man she has secretly been dating for three months, and who she has agreed to marry. Kong is handsome, cultured, fashionable, and seems to know more about cooking and fashion than all the girls put together. Her four friends, mostly well-meaning and ever-so-slightly jealous, believe that Kong can't be this perfect, and conclude he must be a closet gay. They set out on a quest to get the evidence, by any means necessary, to prove to their friend that Kong is actually not going to be the ideal husband she thinks he is.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tMcRErekaHLbSvyzYMVVf8ESyzW.jpg", "actors": ["Patcharasri Benjamas (Pom)", "Meesuk Jaengmeesuk (Pang)", "Pimolwan Suphayang (Fai)", "Kulnadda Pachimsawat (Pat)", "Orpreeya Hunsat (Nim)", "Thienchai Jayasvasti Jr. (Kong)", "Kazuki Yano (Ken-jang)", "Dawido Dorigo (Off)", "Moncheep Siwasinanggoon (Pehng)", "Kanit Sarasin (Joe)", "Sansanee Smanworawong ()", "Michael Shaowanasai (Brother Bee)", "Somphob Chumwongchoti ()", "Pongsak Ditsayadech ()", "Kokkorn Benjathikoon (Special Guest)", "Jira Maligool (Special Guest)", "Jaturong Phooboon (Special Guest)", "Anuchit Sapanpong (Special Guest)", "Prasert Vivattanananpong (Special Guest)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Oel2iMjh1g8"}
