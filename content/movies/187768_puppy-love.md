The main gist of the story, besides trying to go one up on each other, deals with the girls\u2019 hot pursuit of super jock, Paul (Chan Chun Kwok). Ching is the first one to gain Paul\u2019s attention while An An is busy toying with geeky looking Michael\u2019s (Dicky Cheung) love for her. Eventually, Paul gets tired of Ching and Michael wakes up and realizes that An An is playing him and to rub salt in their wounds, Paul decides that An An is the one for him! Next thing you, kiddy hijinks ensue as Michael and Ching feign suicide to make Paul and An An feel guilty, but when the latter believes that the suicide is for real, they too (half heartedly) decide to take their own lives. Michael and Ching must rush to save them from death, but during the whole near explosive melee, they come to the conclusion that they were made for each other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/LGUkWDvi0zKOxajIO9L8h1wIQv.jpg", "actors": ["Sandy Lam San-San (Yung Ching)", "April Pak Wan-Yin (Ding An An)", "Chan Jun-Kwok (Paul)", "Chong Man-Ching (Teacher)", "So Hang-Suen (Ching's mother)", "Law Gwok-Wai (Ching's father)", "Mary Hon Ma-Lee (An's mother)", "Eric Yeung Jan-Yiu (An's father)", "Raymond Fung (Audition judge)", "Terence Chang Ga-Jan (Teacher)", "Yiu Yau-Hung (Tries CPR on Ching)", "Dicky Cheung Wai-Kin (Michael)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
