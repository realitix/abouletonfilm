He was too young to have an opinion about it, but he was mightily impressed all the same. Now it is 1968, and he is a young man. When the Russian tanks come rolling through his village on their way to suppress the stirrings of freedom in Prague, he does what he can to ensure that he's in good odor with those who will inevitably come out on top. This meandering political drama is apparently an exploration of opportunism, but reviewers gave it low marks for clarity of exposition.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nHzXtIeozsFYeUWR1bBtgD9dxax.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
