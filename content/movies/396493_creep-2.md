Unfortunately, Mark Duplass' role, while still portrayed excellently, is essentially the same thing we saw last time around, which, unfortunately, can't possibly have the same impact a second go around.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"}, {"pseudo": "Columbusbuck", "content": "I was disappointed both with the prey, a self-styled fearless profiler of the eccentric, and the antagonist- Bruce, serial killer of 39 boys and men. The former seemed to be a blank canvas when she was forced out of her self-styled persona (video profiler of the eccentric) and the latter, after having done a fantastic job in the original story, seemed bored to me. The dialogue was only marginally creative and the final act felt like someone whispering under their breath \"I've got nothing\".  With the exception of the very last frame of the movie: a look that inspired hopes of better things to come."}], "recommandations_id": [250574, 297160, 334536, 420634]}
