In this wry comedy, Basile (Claudio Bucella) is an eleven-year old boy living in a rural French town (along with his mother) with his grandparents. He has the usual boyish adventures in town, punctuated with odd goings-on brought about by events which take place in his grandfather's crocodile farm. However, there is a deep rivalry between his grandmother and her wheelchair-bound half-sister, Cecile (Jeanne Moreau), who has kept hidden from the world (and her family), and has lived in the attic for decades. Basile eventually feels the wrongness of her situation and feels that he may be the reincarnation of Victor, Cecile's long-lost lover. Eventually things come to a head in a confrontation which provides the town gossips with material for years to come.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qq1CPhchm09jrDFPNecLtkp52ON.jpg", "actors": ["Jeanne Moreau ()", "Micheline Presle ()", "Dominique Pinon ()", "Julien Guiomar ()", "Claudio Bucella ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
