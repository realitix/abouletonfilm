With great determination he won the Formula 1 World Championship, the Indy 500 and the Le Mans 24 hours race, thereby achieving the 'triple crown' of motor racing - a unique feat that remains unmatched to this day. Graham also won the glamorous Monaco Grand Prix five times during an era when drivers routinely met violent death.  Graham's illustrious racing career spanned three decades, which at its height saw him routinely slugging it out with fellow F1 champions Jim Clark and Jackie Stewart. Close friends yet intense rivals on the track, they were the 'Three Musketeers' during a golden era of motor racing. But what was the truth behind Graham's popular public image? 30 years on from his death, his family, close friends and former colleagues paint an intimate, revealing and entertaining portrait of a sporting hero tragically killed in a plane crash in 1975.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eRgzMrEN5foIPjOrb8ZznpCr9kV.jpg", "actors": ["Timothy Block (Himself - Narrator (voice) (as Tim Block))", "John Coombs (Himself - Former Team Owner)", "Bette Hill (Herself)", "Damon Hill (Himself)", "Graham Hill (Himself (archive footage))", "Doug Nye (Himself - Motor racing historian)", "Jackie Stewart (Himself (as Sir Jackie Stewart))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
