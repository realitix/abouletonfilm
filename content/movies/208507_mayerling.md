At a royal hunting lodge there, in 1889, Crown Prince Rudolf--desperate over his father's command to put away his teenage mistress, the Baroness Marie Vetsera--shot her to death and killed himself. The misfortune may indeed have been a murder-suicide, but perhaps it was a political assassination, or even the result of a lunatic family vendetta: scholarship is still catching up with the facts.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zFbBNUfkjp8r2CK9lIISQ6BbogT.jpg", "actors": ["Audrey Hepburn (Countess Marie Vetsera)", "Mel Ferrer (Crown Prince Rudolph)", "Diana Wynyard (The Empress)", "Raymond Massey (The Prime Minister)", "Basil Sydney (The Emperor)", "Judith Evelyn (Countess Larische)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
