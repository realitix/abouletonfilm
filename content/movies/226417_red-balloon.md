She hangs up the phone and goes upstairs to investigate. She finds her screaming and standing up on her bed but can't find anything wrong. She calms the child down and goes back down stairs. This happens several times but things get more ominous and creepy as the babysitter has to investigate the supposedly safe little bedroom.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iDYCxTgfPBXbFsLD1jcBNKLX2Zh.jpg", "actors": ["Rachel Bright (Julie)", "Niamh Palmer Watson (Dorothy)", "Tez Palmer (Alistair Radford)", "Rebecca Summers (Girl on Film (as Rebecca Pitkin))", "Gareth Bennett-Ryan (Policeman)", "Kirsten Hazel Smith ((voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [200048, 57236, 226992, 224997], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
