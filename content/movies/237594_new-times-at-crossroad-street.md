Now we\u2019ve come back. Perhaps it was a sense of duty, perhaps nostalgia that brought us back \u2013 who knows? Perhaps it was both. Daiga, Aldis, Osis \u2013 they\u2019re all our people. The first film had an impact on both the filmmakers and the residents of Crossroad Street. We found friends whom we want to meet again and again. Society has become more prosperous, several value systems coexist side-by-side. People often live in these systems as though they were in different worlds that never meet. We felt that the world inhabited by our people is sinking into oblivion, and so we wanted to show that it still has its own turbulence, that Crossroad Street resembles Latvia\u2019s palm \u2013 the place where a fortune teller can see the lines of its destiny.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qeJHN7e37Ek4QjxoYj3VtvLSmPU.jpg", "actors": ["Juris Gornavs (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
