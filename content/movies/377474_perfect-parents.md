The only one they can afford is St. Mary of the Veil, run by nuns whose 'preference' for Catholic families is de facto exclusivity, given the waiting list. So they pose as devout, and get his murky mate Eddie to find them a priest they can 'bribe' for a parish reference, while Lucy is genuinely converted. It works, but when Stuart overhears a dark secret things take a tragic turn.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pb8V7NTO25u6Z25L7e0cQEjzBRs.jpg", "actors": ["Christopher Eccleston (Stuart)", "Susannah Harker (Alison)", "Brendan Coyle (Ed)", "David Warner (Father Thomas)", "Lesley Manville (Sister Antonia)", "Stephen Taylor (Kevin)", "Natalie Hallam (Catholic School Nun)", "Maxine Evans (Teacher)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
