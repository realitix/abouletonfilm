The film made it to the U.S. in 1952 as Life Begins Tomorrow. Made in cooperation with UNESCO, the film speculates on the future of mankind after the advent of Atomic Energy. Many prominent French artists and intellects contribute to the narration: Jean-Pierre Aumont plays The Man of Today, Andre Labarthe is the Man of Tomorrow, and Jean-Paul Sartre, Daniel Agache, Jean Rostand, Le Corbusier, Pablo Picasso and Andre Gide are respectively seen as \"The Existentialist,\" \"The Psychiatrist,' \"The Biologist,\" \"The Architect,\" \"The Artist\" and \"The Author\" (talk about typecasting!) Film clips of hospitals, schoolrooms, scientific laboratories, and even nightclubs are woven into Vedre's fascinating tapestry.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8nC7GhgJZxZ7yESi3yQP80t8zPe.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
