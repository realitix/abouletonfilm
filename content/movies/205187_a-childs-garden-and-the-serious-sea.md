But the film also vaguely calls to mind William Blake\u2014more perhaps for his art than his poetry: there is both a sense of darkness and of mystical transport in Brakhage's images. The first film in the loose \"Vancouver Island\" quartet, Brakhage films locations around the British Columbia locale where his second wife, Marilyn, grew up. He films land, sea, and sky and intercuts frequently between them. Shots are often out-of-focus, to accentuate color and light; they are hand-held, upside down, and fleeting. All of this is no surprise for those who know Brakhage's work: anything and everything is valid, as long as it works.\" - Cine-File.info", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6E0yZLse18B9hFQPbjcaYbEHO4z.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
