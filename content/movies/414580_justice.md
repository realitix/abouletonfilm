In a nod to director Lars Von Trier (Dancer in the Dark, Dogville), Scarborough puts Toby in situations that continually spiral out of control, leaving Toby no choice but to use his sexual moxie to get out of each situation. It's a role that only a sexual Olympian like Rollins could accomplish. This Hardcore Director's Cut Two Disc Set features 7 scorching hot scenes with 16 sexy, hung Hot House Men in a production we'd be hard-pressed to beat.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wr7KBylsKYGuRkmsoQvktUTco8h.jpg", "actors": ["Brad Star ()", "Carlos Morales ()", "Duke Michaels ()", "Jordan Vaughn ()", "Kent North ()", "Marc Williams ()", "Marco Paris ()", "Mike Roberts ()", "Nick Horn ()", "Nick Piston ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
