Gruesome and grisly murders are our entry point into the psyche of the Aswang of Quezon City. More a meditation on the workings of a disturbed mind than a detective thriller, it nonetheless shows us a cat and mouse mind game. We watch and squirm in terror as the Pinoy vampire strikes again and again.  \u00a9 Mubi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mLGSNgGqB20SNuRsXazcR6Euuzg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
