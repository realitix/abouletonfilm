They have no indoor plumbing and subsist mostly on a diet of cheap processed food and bread-and-mayo sandwiches. Sasha works in the IT industry, but a person of his talents cannot find steady work in the countryside and is forced to eke out a living as a computer repairman for his colorful neighbors. Sasha drives from client to client in his 1972 Lada, making barely enough money to cover his gas expenses, while Marina is busy running their impoverished, even by village standards, household. The Kiselyovs have happiness in spades - the heart of their family is their youngest child, the precocious and charming Katya. What kind of a future awaits this little girl?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cwoR0jXcpYpMKvbn1RECJZWhh1r.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
