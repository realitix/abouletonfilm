The band is the brainchild of Rich Ward and Chris Jericho, two larger-than-life personalities that have spent the past decade shaping their own brand of hard hitting music. Ward is one of metal\u2019s pioneers \u2013 as the mastermind of Stuck Mojo, he soldered metal with rhythmic vocals long before it became fashionable, touring the world with some of metal\u2019s biggest bands and being hailed as one of Pantera legend Dimebag Darrell and Black Label Society/former Ozzy Osbourne axe man Zakk Wylde\u2019s favourite guitarists. And frontmen don\u2019t come more dynamic than Chris Jericho, one of professional wrestling\u2019s biggest superstars, the embodiment of charisma, and the by-product of a lifetime immersed in metal.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
