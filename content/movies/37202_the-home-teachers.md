He has just planted himself in front of his massive television screen scarfing down chicken when his new home teaching companion, Nelson, calls to inform him that he has set an appointment to visit the Mori family in 15 minutes. Mormon males serving as home teachers are admonished to visit with their assigned families once a month, bring them a spiritual message, and provide help as necessary. Nelson, a nerdy \"letter of the law\" kind of Mormon who will not even purchase gas on a Sunday, intends to visit 100 % of his assigned families every month, and as this is the last day of the month even the many madcap mishaps that start immediately will not deter him from completing his duty despite Greg's griping and attempts to get back to the games.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lh3qT9C4V8Eor81viV3HcWcNB3H.jpg", "actors": ["Jeff Birk (Nelson Parker)", "Michael Birkeland (Greg Blazer)", "Jimmy Chunga (Phat Cop)", "Jentri Harding (Josie Blazer)", "Michael Flynn (Karl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [16668, 38951], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
