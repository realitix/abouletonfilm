He played for the Calgary Flames, New York Rangers and Chicago Blackhawks. He made 50 million dollars and threw it away on drugs, alcohol and gambling. He reached bottom, and bought a gun intending to kill himself. At the last minute he changed his mind. He wrote a book revealing that, as a teen, he'd been sexually abused by his coach. It created a firestorm of publicity and went on to become a No. 1 bestseller in Canada. Theo starred in a top-rated skating competition reality show and had a cameo in the opening film at TIFF last year. Inspired by the book, the documentary follows Theo's struggle with the aftermath of the book and gives his turmoil a voice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/deUgeO19s6pXcAiTJ3Fsi8cej5.jpg", "actors": ["Theo Fleury (Himself)", "Ron MacLean (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
