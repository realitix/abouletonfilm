A woman has murdered her husband. That's clear enough. Now the woman is in a psychiatric hospital because it seemed clear to the judges that she was not fully competent. Her doctor, who is helping her a great deal, has problems of his own. First, he is against the cookie-cutter treatment practices of his hospital, second, he is on shaky mental ground himself. Then he violates his therapeutic ethics by carrying on an affair with the woman he is treating.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y253F32hKorufTWGdYexBZCtPLJ.jpg", "actors": ["Lotte Tarp ()", "Erik Weders\u00f8e ()", "Jens \u00d8sterholm ()", "Anne-Lise Gabold ()", "Lisbeth Movin ()", "Georg Kringelbach ()", "Hans Chr. \u00c6gidius ()", "Erik N\u00f8rgaard ()", "Niels Barfoed ()", "Finn J\u00f8rgensen ()", "Danny Andersen ()", "Steen Kaal\u00f8 ()", "Vera Gebuhr ()", "Gerda Madsen ()", "Manja Mourier ()", "Elsebeth Reingaard ()", "Rachel B\u00e6klund ()", "Erik Kj\u00e6rsgaard ()", "Peter Ronild ()", "Lise Schr\u00f8der ()", "Inger Stender ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
