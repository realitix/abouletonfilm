The women getting raped appear to be raped by a rapist who has raped them earlier and who was not caught. Detective Eileen Burke, who is working together with detectives Carella, Meyer and Brown, goes undercover and pretends to be one of the women who was raped earlier in order to lure out the rapist. Her boyfriend, Det. Kling, is not happy with her assignment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4mlCnZ9CklhvA2yOG93GGqIaJDw.jpg", "actors": ["Dale Midkiff (Det.
