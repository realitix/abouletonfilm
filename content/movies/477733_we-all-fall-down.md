Michael's best friend Kris (Martin Cummins) is, if anything, in even worse shape; a gifted artist, Kris' appetite for drugs has all but silenced his muse, and his girlfriend Ryan (Francoise Robertson) has little interest in helping him control his dangerous appetites. The drug-related death of a close friend and a bizarre experience with a junkie prostitute (Helen Shaver) convinces Michael that he needs to clean up once and for all, but Kris may be too far gone to save.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k58bMCXqR58fYpc6NiJGHFWyzWb.jpg", "actors": ["Ryan Reynolds (Red Shoes)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
