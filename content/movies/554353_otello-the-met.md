This supremely demanding part was to become his signature role, an accomplishment against which other interpreters are still measured to this day. Domingo stars opposite Sherrill Milnes\u2019s conniving Iago and Gilda Cruz-Romo\u2019s touching Desdemona, all brilliantly conducted by Music Director James Levine.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dJY4IOIO7CDOXxWtJ3d0K7wSE7b.jpg", "actors": ["Pl\u00e1cido Domingo ()", "Gilda Cruz-Romo ()", "Sherrill Milnes ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
