But when you think of movie sequels, there's a lot of history you can point to to show were they've gone wrong. Especially in comedy sequels. **Especially** especially in comedy sequels to cult classics. Especially especially especially in comedy sequels to cult classics where they waited twenty years since the last entry. When you dig that far, and look at the company that _Super Troopers 2_ keeps, it's not exactly promising.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly enough though, I actually kind of dig this movie? It is in no way better than the first, it's not even in any way **as good** as the first, but I did feel that it was **worthy** of the first, I had more than a couple of pretty genuine out-loud laughs, and that's not something I get a lot from the cinema of today.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"}], "recommandations_id": [39939, 490004, 340022, 437557]}
