The future lord of the manor, O\u017ebej, falls in love with the new maid, Meta. His family, however, is opposed to the match and successfully plots to keep the young couple apart. Although Meta must endure scorn and degradation at the hands of the villagers, O\u017ebej still cannot tear himself away from her. Five children are born of their union, all of whom are looked upon as bastards by the manor folk.
