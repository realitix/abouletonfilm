If you ever saw Jorge Negrete singing in a movie you'll laugh to tears when Tin Tan sings. And with the lighting effects, you can see actual flashes of Jorge Negrete until you hear him singing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gjzBivAxyScclTXO889CiUFfPj6.jpg", "actors": ["Germ\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s (Tin Tan)", "Marcelo Ch\u00e1vez (Pioquinto Chumacero)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
