Screened in four parts, lasting a total of approximately twelve minutes, it shows a bunch of old boys, some in full military regalia, others in top hats and suits travelling by boat from one dock to another. From there they make up part of a parade as they travel to a hotel. The men are Russian and Japanese envoys gathered by President Teddy Roosevelt to hammer out a peace deal to bring the Russo-Japanese war to an end.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
