She's now convicted and because of this uncooperative attitude gets the maximum sentence, 10 years in a women's jail wing. Model husband Larry, who wasn't informed of her dumb schemes is left running her appeal, the household and spoiled daughter who now feels abandoned. Since most inmates are junkies or prostitutes, sergeant Ed Crang and fellow corrupt jailers can run a 'favors in kind exchange'. For rebels, it gets worse. Larry however has his own radio show, so it all hangs on gathering proof.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bHO7I4WeRhxyIrSLOFSPSafGQS7.jpg", "actors": ["Stephanie Zimbalist (Lynn Schaffer)", "Finola Hughes (Angie)", "Gary Frank (Larry Schaffer)", "Rusty Schwimmer ()", "Kimberly Russell (Frannie)", "Tasia Valenza ()", "Joel Polis ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
