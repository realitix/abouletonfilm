Set deep in dark mythical English woods Stagknight presents a uniquely stupid look at this genre through the cracked \"Weekend Warriors\" paintball team. This is mansville not boytown on a blow-out bachelor paintball weekender bender of dirty tricks, hot babes and truly splatter-tastic medieval kills to die for.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eOIK2XkfyeKskAHXhNFkS3AekvU.jpg", "actors": ["Jocelyn Osorio (Blossom)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
