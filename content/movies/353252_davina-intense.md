I'm completely hooked and you will be too!  Intense is based on the principle of High Intensity Training, which means that you'll be working out for a shorter amount of time at - you guessed it - a higher intensity.  It's all about getting your heart rate up really high for short bursts, which is great for fitness, toning and fatburning!  Intense Cardio Box - Fantastic combination of boxing moves and high speed interval training  Intense Toning - Brilliant mix of toning exercises with weights, and more high speed interval training.  Intense Abs - A fantastic high velocity workout for your size pack and core muscles.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4YBlvy7rBBiSV4mY8TYdNGs53Ck.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
