He also presents his pet dog to a poor peasant and his wife. For the poor peasant and his wife, the dog is not a mere dog, but a symbol of the royalty which had always inspired in them feelings of respect, admiration and blind worship. They bathe the dog in a very ceremonious manner and take much care of it. They even desist from tying it up. But when the dog bites and kills a duck and then a boy, it leads to problems. The democratic leader orders the arrest of the dog, followed by the arrest of the poor peasant. Then follow protests, talks, negotiations leading to more interesting developments.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9vFHMpo7eGyfFvgaUOf4OaJp9oC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
