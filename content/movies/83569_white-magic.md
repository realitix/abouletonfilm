The story surrounding the whole thing is completely insignificant compared to the wonderful pictures. Nearly all the actors in the movie are world champions in their category. Willy Bogner's most famous work are probably the ski stunts in most of the James Bond movies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wuRNOwqHdXHhZLD3CSp04LTx7f.jpg", "actors": ["John Eaves ()", "Alke Reiter ()", "Reto Lamm ()", "Markus Wasmeier ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
