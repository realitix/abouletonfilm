Yet as accomplished as Pacquiao has become, all men have their limits. The question is: Has Pacquiao finally reached his?  When Pacquiao slips into the ring to challenge WBC lightweight champion David Diaz, he will be facing a 135-pound opponent who began his career weighing 142 and has worked down from there.
