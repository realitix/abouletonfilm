It shows us how Parisians of the 1920s spent their Sundays, by following the progress of four young people on their day off - a girl, her beau, and his two rivals. The film is at turns comic, wistful and romantic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oWHibFzYVGQ9mSMV9l7ZY8MxDfs.jpg", "actors": ["Mona Goya ()", "Georges P\u00e9clet ()", "Monsieur de Villette ()", "Mario Nasthasio ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
