In a dark and dusty shop, a devil's supply of human teeth grown dangerously low. And in the tangled lanes of Prague, a young art student is about to be caught up in a brutal otherwordly war. Meet Karou. She fills her sketchbooks with monsters that may or may not be real; she's prone to disappearing on mysterious \"errands\"; she speaks many languages--not all of them human; and her bright blue hair actually grows out of her head that color. Who is she? That is the question that haunts her, and she's about to find out.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jvwac8LWchKsy7NS7ClTAIDbTzF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
