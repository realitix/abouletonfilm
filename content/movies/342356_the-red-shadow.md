He soon becomes the Riffs' leader and assumes a secret identity: \"The Red Shadow.\" Pierre is still regarded as a weakling by the French troops because he always seems to let the Red Shadow slip through their fingers. When Pierre's sweetheart, Margot, visits the French garrison, she succumbs to the Red Shadow's charms.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Alexander Gray (Pierre Bierbeau / The Red Shadow)", "Bernice Claire (Margot Fontaine)", "Max Stamm ()", "Gracie Worth ()", "Lester Cole (Leader of Musical Ensemble)", "Reginald Carrington ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
