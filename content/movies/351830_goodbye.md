You put a camera in between, just like the boy that unrelentingly lets his camera run at his father\u2019s funeral. His mother can order him to put the thing away as much as she wants, the son keeps capturing what his eyes don\u2019t want to see and his heart doesn\u2019t want to feel. In the process, the handheld perspective also represents the mourning of a child who\u2019d obviously rather play than weep.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/EpaybuseJXT8opAUDL0LcxWOi3.jpg", "actors": ["Suzan Bogaerdt ()", "Arthur Boni ()", "Ben de Jong ()", "Alida Dors ()", "Jona Jungerman ()", "Lieneke le Roux ()", "Maud Loth ()", "Jetty Mathurin ()", "Patrick Mathurin ()", "Sieger Sloot ()", "Maureen Tauwnaar ()", "Tamar van den Dop ()", "Ylva van Putten ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
