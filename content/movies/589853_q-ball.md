Felony convictions derailed the lives of the San Quentin Prison squad, some of them promising players. The rocky road to rehabilitation is the point of the game in this eye-opening, inspirational documentary. Q Ball\u2018s focus is on determined men grappling indelibly with the gravity of their crimes and reaching for redemption. The film zeroes in on about-to-be-paroled star player Harry \u201cATL\u201d Smith, who has not surrendered his NBA dreams; Anthony \u201cAnt\u201d Ammons, a lifer who has become a mentor to younger inmates; and head coach Rafael Cuevas, a convicted murderer who understands his role in preparing his players for life on the outside. For all three men, the team is not just a means of recreation, but a form of family.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sL1xwCyJ9w9Iz3MOuH6gl6EZtvH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
