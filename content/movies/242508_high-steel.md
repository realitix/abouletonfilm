They are the Mohawk Indians of Kahnawake, near Montr\u00e9al, famed for their skill in erecting the steel frames of skyscrapers. The film shows their nimble work, high above the pavement, but there are also glimpses of the quieter community life of the old Kahnawake Reserve.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4PDZlgl7HNXD9deAiCOCjoWAHQS.jpg", "actors": ["Don Francks (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
