However, after her performance, the valuable necklace is missing and so the actress goes to hire some detectives to find it. I loved the strange detective agency in the film. The place had a sliding door, chains on the wall and detectives seem to magically appear out of the floor. It was very kooky but fun.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5Q2UMlYkzd1sd7zbKhIP5hoO19O.jpg", "actors": ["Lucien Bataille (Zigoto)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
