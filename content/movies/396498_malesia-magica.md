The movie also lingers on the contamination caused by the corrupting Western society. Nice exotic and harmless 60s mondo movie with some great visuals. Urban clumsiness is also widely documented: slums with pimps, whores, poverty.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oZCU4MEew9Mn0eJ5yEtDf9aPwMH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
