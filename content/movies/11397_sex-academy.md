That doesn't stop it from being crass in the worst possible way, or completely uncomfortable. Or completely unoriginal... although I guess you could argue that part is by necessity... Look, what I'm saying is, credit where credit's due. It's like, fuck _Transformers_, what a garbage bunch of films those are, but at the same time, it's hard to knock a billion dollar gross earning.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Definitely not for me, but I sort of get the appeal_."}], "recommandations_id": [9285, 8859, 10591, 9352]}
