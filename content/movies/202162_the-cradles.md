{"tmdb_id": 202162, "title": "The Cradles", "original_title": "Les berceaux", "slug_title": "the-cradles", "date": "1935-01-01", "genre": [""], "score": "6.7/10", "synopsis": "Les Berceaux is about the dedicated sailors who venture out into the deepest ocean, and the wives who must await their return. The woman sits in her living room, gently rocking her infant\u2019s cradle as she sings, the movement mimicking the rolling motion of the ocean waves. Many men will lose their lives to the ocean\u2019s vast waters, but the juxtaposition of death and life (in the cradle) suggests an endless and noble cycle. Kirsanoff imaginatively places a rear-projection screen outside the woman\u2019s window, through which, as she sings, we can watch the ocean waves lapping up against the shore, or the ship charging majestically over the water. Also worth noting is that the film was photographed by Boris Kaufman, who later also shot On the Waterfront (1954) and 12 Angry Men (1957). \u2014Shortcutcinema.blogspot.pt", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qMx3HEJ8YiveyQw92SWXEPovuez.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
