The nominal leading man is Tommy Nelson (James Hall), the black-sheep son of a wealthy alumnus (Anders Randolph). Though Nelson is an ace football player, President Sheffield refuses to enroll the boy because of his bad reputation, whereupon Tommy's father withdraws his financial backing and bars his son from ever setting foot on Sheffield's campus. Falling in love with Nan, Tommy signs up with the college under an assumed name, giving up his wastrel ways to lead the football team to victory. Joe E. Brown steals the show as Speed Hanson, a goofy gridiron star who emits a loud and long yell whenever scoring a touchdown (this was, in fact, the first film in which Brown's famous \"Yeeeeowww\" was heard -- but certainly not the last).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zsA8Yt05vTlspldcGrNE5G5efgT.jpg", "actors": ["Joan Bennett (Nan)", "Joe E.
