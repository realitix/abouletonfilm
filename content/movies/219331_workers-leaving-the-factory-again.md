Inspired by the Lumi\u00e8re brothers\u2019 first film, La sortie de l\u2019usine Lumi\u00e8re \u00e0 Lyon, which shows a large number of workers leaving their factory\u2019s gate, Gruzei begins in the interior, in a passageway (made to seem incredibly long by the editing) that emerges from the darkness. Solely portions of the corridor \u2014 a production line at the closed Austria Tabak factory \u2014 flash into view in the buzzing neon light. The impressive sound and choreography of light were taken from an installation by the artist in the empty spaces.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
