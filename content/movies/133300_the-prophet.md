From love to crime, from marriage to work, from beauty to the ultimate death. Instead of a traditional film adaptation Tarn has been guided by actress Thandie Newton's reading of the text - and then traveled around the world with his 16mm and HD camera and filmed people, situations and places that resonate with, rather than illustrate, the text's themes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3i2gdYIG7UMMkXcOhrO91ApTArv.jpg", "actors": ["Thandie Newton (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
