It stars Stevens, John Lupton, Larry Storch, Maureen Hingert and Aaron Saxon. Music is by Paul Dunlap and cinematography by Charles Van Enger.\r\n\r\nIt feels a bit churlish to criticize Mark Stevens' Gun Fever for its cheap feel and well worn plotting, for he clearly has respect for the genre. Apart from budget restrictions stymying his hopes for something more dramatically appealing, he's probably more hampered by his own decision to make a safe old traditional Oater. He relies on tried and tested staples in the hope of appeasing the masses, particularly with the standard \"get revenge on the man who instigated the killing of my folks\" storyline.\r\n\r\nThe wind machine is permanently on, more so in the sound mix than actually blowing up a gale in scenes, so it's not a good sign that this is noticeable to viewers more so than what is actually on the screen. The Mexican character is played poorly by New Yorker Larry Scorch, and this is consistent with the all round average feel to the play playing out. However, Stevens and Enger manage to put a grim texture to the visuals, creating an earthy mud and rags look more befitting the real Wild West than the glossy Hollywood one.\r\n\r\nSadly doesn't live up to the promise of its throat grabbing opening, and not one to recommend seeking out as a matter of need, but there's worse out there and it's not for Stevens' want of trying that it's no great genre offering.  5/10"}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
