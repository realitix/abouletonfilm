He finds the spy \"disguised\" (with his head upside down) but Willoughby uncovers the \"disguise\" and gives chase. Agent X-13 ends up at the train station and riding the Orient Express. The Inspector follows with the agent using a variety of schemes to do away with Willoughby. He notices a downhill grade and sends a safe sliding down to crush the Inspector but the grade becomes an uphill grade and the safe ends up crashing into X-13. X-13 tries feeding him several poisonous foods and Willoughby's stomach turns out to have a trap door. Finally, Willoughby and X-13 battle on top of the train with X-13 leaping from the train to avoid hitting a tunnel and lands in Willoughby's net, then finding himself tied to a scale after going through the tunnel. The Inspector, having captured the crook, exclaims, \"That's what I call apprehending crime on a big scale!\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vhgAIJIMwgWcmzrfTVtH6PaHj2X.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
