What there is is a master criminal named Shlobotka doing some after-hours midnight work at the bank and, being somewhat cocky, he places a call to the police station just to let them know what he is up to. Clancy (the bulldog) answers the phone and then crawls into the phone in pursuit of Shlobotka.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
