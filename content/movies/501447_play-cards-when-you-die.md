Though his work and his life are rather dull, he at least gets along somewhat well with his young daughter. He recieves a phone call one day, informing him of the sudden death of one of his colleagues. Shortly after this shocking news, his wife who is now living apart cuts him down further by telling him, \"You don't see anything.\" While walking in the night, Ichiro is struck by an idea: why don't we go there? He heads off holding his daughter's hand. And thus begins a strange little tale of an ordinary father and his daughter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uDDuB7v5LQ2c0GXdrnRnTU79ofc.jpg", "actors": ["Yukiya Kitamura ()", "Ayumi Kimura ()", "Chieko Misaka ()", "Y\u00fbko Genkaku ()", "Noboru Mitani ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
