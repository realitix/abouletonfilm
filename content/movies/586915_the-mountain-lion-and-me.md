Wildlife filmmaker Casey Anderson became one of those lucky few after following the tracks of the elusive cat from his backyard into the world of a mother and her three cubs. It was the beginning of what would become a remarkable relationship that gave Casey a rare glimpse into the life of a mountain lion family and a new understanding of an animal we know so little about.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Casey Anderson (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
