Growing up in Hawaii and of Chinese descent, he always imagined he\u2019d be a doctor like his father. He enrolled at Notre Dame as a premed student and didn\u2019t think much of playing football until he decided he needed a more well-rounded life. He was the placekicker on his high school football team and decided to walk on to Notre Dame\u2019s. At 5-foot-5 and 135 pounds, Ho was one of the smallest players in a major college football program \u2014 and suddenly became a celebrity on and off campus. As a walk-on, Ho didn\u2019t receive any financial support from his school: a pure student-athlete. He did it for the love of the game and for the love of Notre Dame. After the 1988 season, the walk-on walked off the field. Ho continued his premed degree, but no longer played football. Yet he was a crucial part in Notre Dame\u2019s most recent undefeated season.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n0qzdqXIxYN0kDxhRiIYteLaN86.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
