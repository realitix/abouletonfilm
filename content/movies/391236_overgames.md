Asked \"So how many crazy people watched you?\", he responded: \"A whole crazy, psychologically disturbed nation\". Why were the Germans or to be more precise, the West Germans, a psychologically disturbed nation at that time? This is a film about cheerful and serious games, therapies for re-education and self-imposed re-education, as well as the history of the idea of permanent revolution. Those appearing include directors and producers of gameshows, psychiatrists, anthropologists, and the diversely paranoid.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A0VsNxBINRs2E5eKxsguPwsiyS5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
