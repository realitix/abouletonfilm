Earlene lives across the street from the Bean's trailer, and the view from her window is better than any daytime television soap opera; especially Beal Bean, and especially Beal Bean shirtless. When Reuben Bean is sent to prison for resisting arrest for out-of-season deer hunting, Beal takes up with Reuben's woman Roberta. He also has a child by Earlene, with a triangle of sex complicated by poverty.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aPhwUrsviNrbBs8khuDHsnX9cn9.jpg", "actors": ["Martha Plimpton (Earlene Pomerleau)", "Kelly Lynch (Roberta Bean)", "Rutger Hauer (Rueben Bean)", "Patrick McGaw (Beal Bean)", "Jennifer Warren (Cop #1)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
