Mr Cooper has just been made redundant, but the family are trying to keep this a secret from the other guests. Also staying at the hotel are Keith and Jo, a young couple on their honeymoon, and an older couple, Mr and Mrs Thornton. Waking early one morning, Colin amuses himself by dangling one of his sister's sandals out of the window on a piece of string. The sandal accidentally lands on a flat roof just outside the window of the honeymooning couple, and his father's now straitened financial circumstances mean Colin has to get it back, by fair means or foul.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aKaQkN3zjz471oxhFClDvS6KMaa.jpg", "actors": ["Alun Armstrong ()", "Marjorie Yates ()", "Gary Carp ()", "Susan Hopkins ()", "Lynne Carol ()", "Clifford Kershaw ()", "Ken Jones ()", "Jane Freeman ()", "Jonathan Coy ()", "Rosalind Wilson ()", "Harry Markham ()", "Albert Modley ()", "Helene Palmer ()", "Stephen Greenwood ()", "Bernard Atha ()", "Lee Atkins ()", "Bert Gaunt ()", "Elizabeth Dawn ()", "Paula Tilbrook ()", "Denis Bond ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
