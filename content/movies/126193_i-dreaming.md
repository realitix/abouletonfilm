Occasionally he watches two young children at play; the film sometimes speeds up. Handwritten words, like \"dark void\" and \"waiting longing,\" cross the screen. Film and phrases often come in short bursts. Outdoor it looks gray and cold.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fwb5ryqcKxDW9kEkUvWS22jVFpP.jpg", "actors": ["Stan Brakhage ()", "Bearthm Brakhage ()", "Neowyn Brakhage ()", "Rarc Brakhage ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [126194, 126218, 126215, 126202], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
