Filmed in High Definition and recorded in true surround sound, the outstanding singing of the all-star cast, led superbly by Sarah Connolly, and the vivid playing of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment under the energising baton of William Christie reveal the colour and dramatic character of Handel\u2019s music in a most delightful manner.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mFAsJNgMlcv7U6Xq4AJamyIHlva.jpg", "actors": ["Sarah Connolly (Giulio Cesare)", "Danielle de Niese (Cleopatra)", "Angelika Kirchschlager (Sesto)", "Christophe Dumaux (Tolomeo)", "Patricia Bardon (Cornelia)", "Christopher Maltman (Achilla)", "Rachid Ben Abdeslam (Nireno)", "Alexander Ashworth (Curio)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
