Starring Stephen Walters, Suzanne Maddock and Amanda Mealing.  Based on the acclaimed play by Jim Morris, voted Most Promising Playwright by the Financial Times and Morning Star in 1981.  Blood on the Dole shows the lives of four teenagers, two boys and two girls, struggling to cope after being thrust into the real world for the first time after leaving school.  Living in deprived Merseyside, the four youths' bright-eyed optimism for their futures and new-found freedom is soon crushed by the realities of unemployment, poverty, and the brutal reality of living and trying to find work in a city in decline.  They all soon find themselves in the hopeless situation of facing complete dependence on state handouts, \"the dole\". The four teenagers instead find themselves turning to each other to find the strength to survive.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rbPAjYe4hx1204Njm1aaxIH6JjN.jpg", "actors": ["Stephen Walters (Joey Jackson)", "Philip Dowd (Ricky Jones)", "Suzanne Maddock (Cathy Thompson)", "Rachel Caldwell (Jean Kavanagh)", "Aneirin Hughes (David Williams)", "Jake Abraham (Paul Price)", "Rachel Maxwell (Tracey Ryan)", "Amanda Mealing (Laura)", "Gill West (Jobcentre Receptionist)", "Jodie Draper (Jobcentre Receptionist)", "Andrew Schofield (Post Office Supervisor)", "Alan Igbon (Art Gallery Attendant)", "Kevin Knapman (Dealer)", "Dilys Price (Mrs Williams)", "Elwyn Hughes (Mr Williams)", "Noreen Kershaw (Aunty Vera)", "Ray Gravell (Anton)", "Dorien Thomas (Emrys)", "David Thompson (Anthony)", "Simon Fisher (Glyn)", "Dicken Ashworth (Cockler)", "Clare Welch (Hill Walker Woman)", "Paul Williamson (Hill Walker Man)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
