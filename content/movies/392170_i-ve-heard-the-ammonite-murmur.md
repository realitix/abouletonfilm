They are among the most commonly found fossils, so they must have been extremely plentiful. In this meditative and largely unstructured first feature, a young geologist is traveling by train to visit his sister in the countryside after having received a disturbing and mysterious letter from her. As he travels, he remembers his childhood fixation with rocks, nurtured by his mother, and his very strong affection for his sister.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Kenzo Saeki (Brother)", "Hiroko Ishimaru (Sister)", "Ichiko Hashimoto (Mother)", "Takeo Kimura (Professor)", "Arinori Ichihara (Old man)", "Kazuichi Hanawa (Worker)", "Oji Suzuki (Worker)", "Masayuki Mori (Worker)", "Tetsuya Fujita (Brother as a boy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
