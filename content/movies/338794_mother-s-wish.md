In Mexico, a stripper dances night after night to keep a roof over her child\u2019s head. In Canada, a woman becomes a mother for the first time after enduring seven miscarriages. Finnish filmmaker Joonas Bergh\u00e4ll has travelled to South African settlements, Nepalese terraced fields and Russia\u2019s metropolis Moscow to investigate an unshakable and almost magical connection: the bond between mother and child. MOTHER\u2018S WISH portrays 10 women from the most varied of cultural and social backgrounds who all tell of the beauty and difficulty of being a mother. These are not only stories of love and pride \u2013 but also of disappointed hopes and the most precarious of life circumstances. Above all else, however, the protagonists tell of their determination \u2013 regardless of their current living conditions \u2013 to fight for a better future.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sxNnYColvHbTi7GeBHMTbejE9o2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
