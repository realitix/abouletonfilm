Dave Wade, exhausted from the heat, lands on the shore near the hotel and reports having escaped from a nearby cannibal island. Stella has her servants, Manua and Loru, care for him, but Shane, to whom she is married but with whom she has never lived, orders him taken to his house, intent on stealing his gold. In a drunken orgy, Shane takes the gold, provoking a fight in which Stella aids Wade. When Ma Blackney dies and Stella recovers the gold, she suggests they go to another island and establish a trading business; but because of a misunderstanding, Stella is kidnaped by the natives and taken to the cannibal island. Disregarding their differences, Wade and Shane join forces and go to the island; Shane sacrifices himself to stall the cannibals while Stella and Wade flee to the sea.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iji6gpDy1PynJ0vgSt3A3lGK8kr.jpg", "actors": ["Monte Blue (Dave Wade)", "Myrna Loy (Moira)", "Betty Compson (Stella)", "Noah Beery (Shane)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
