Confronted with the realization that his children knew very little about their origins, he became determined to pass down to them the customs and traditions of his ancestors. This film is the powerful biographical study of a 25-year span in Pete's life, from his early days as an oil-rig roughneck, rodeo rider and cowboy, to the present as an Indian concerned with preserving his tribe's spiritual heritage in the face of an energy-oriented industrial age.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qacXZP2K1PmSN0ldIF1GY7AjTFv.jpg", "actors": ["Pete Standing Alone (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
