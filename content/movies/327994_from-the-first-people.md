The film reveals that life along the Kobuk River is still inextricably linked to the harsh and starkly beautiful land, where the December sun rises at 11 a.m. and sets three hours later. An old man shares his feelings about the changes he has seen: \"Long ago, forest fires put themselves out. Today, even when men fight them, they burn. I think our earth is getting old, and when things get old and dry they burn. Our earth is the same way,\" he adds. \"It's ready to burn. I think it's coming close to the time when we will have a new one.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7QI9TqDJv24VhB9DCEWsMyBzddK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
