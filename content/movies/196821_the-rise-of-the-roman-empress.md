The Rise Of The Roman Empress is the compelling unofficial life story of Italy's newest member of Parliament. This unabashed sex queen believes that in order for people to be happy, she must teach them how to enjoy their lives and loves. So many Italians, so little time! The call goes out to her friends in America, \"Help my people find sexual happiness.\" To the rescue comes the man of the decade, in his last feature film, John Holmes.
