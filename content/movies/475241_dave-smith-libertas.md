Dave's stand up explores the underbelly of the American political infrastructure and shines a light on our own hypocrisy when it comes to social issues such as racism and sexism. Dave has a fresh approach to political comedy. He doesn't simply align blindly with one side of the political spectrum like many of his contemporaries but would rather call bullsh*t on both sides.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8bJvxcoHgAD0ehIdBnQ9jyRZYbG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
