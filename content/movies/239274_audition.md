The music can however be very important. Zwartjes composes it himself, sometimes together with his brother Rudolf and Lodewijk de Boer. Audition is a fine example of a Zwartjes film with an important soundtrack. It is a visual improvisation of cinematography and acting. There is hardly a \u2018story line\u2019. A man and a woman watch another woman singing, predominantly in exciting black and white images.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pAA4rAtmitukgyTLiRilXsMOBV0.jpg", "actors": ["Moniek Toebosch ()", "Christian Manders ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
