Recorded live during the tour are 16 songs featured in this film, However this is more than a video rock concert - including many humourous off-stage shots that show the band sampling some of the sights, customs and culture of the lands their fans call home", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pxn9nMz3khpaqAAY5CEcLt5lBzq.jpg", "actors": ["Sting (Himself)", "Andy Summers (Himself)", "Stewart Copeland (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
