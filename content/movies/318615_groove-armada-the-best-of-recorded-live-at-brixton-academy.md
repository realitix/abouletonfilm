Featuring the biggest hits from their last three albums, this anthology of their time on the Jive label is packed with downbeat and upbeat anthems, and an array of music as heard in film, television and radio.  The subdued intro and trombone melody of \"Superstylin\" opens the collection softly with the now legendary bassline kicking in for a perfect euphoric moment. Other upbeat anthems include the piano house of \"If Everybody Looked the Same\", the Fatboy Slim mix of Gramma Funk's \"I See You Baby\" (both of which have been used to sell cars) and the more recent disco hit, \"Easy\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rQ1f7hgYSWc7XX0Kho7AcFuco7k.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
