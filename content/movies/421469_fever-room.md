Like the film, this projection-performance presents the layers of reality and fantasy. Apichatpong fuses his memories with the actors\u2019 and fictionalises the narrative. Here the people takes refuge in dreams while their land is on a brink of collapse, echoing Thailand\u2019s present state of military dictatorship.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xr4zyWdk1kxPG52MBUvJ5qi6QDS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
