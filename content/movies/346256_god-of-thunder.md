Enraged by devastation of his home, Thor pursues Loki, but in the journey, he is rendered defenseless, awakening on Earth without his mighty hammer, or his memory. Alone and disoriented, Thor is besieged by Loki\u2019s followers, hell-bent on stopping him\u2026at any cost. Enlisting the help of a female human companion, Thor fights his way North, in search of his mythical weapon.
