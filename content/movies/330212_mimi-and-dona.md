For a 92-year-old mother, Mimi, who has cared 64 years for her daughter, Dona, who has an intellectual disability, it means facing the inevitable -- she will not outlive her daughter -- and finding her daughter a home. This poignant, heartbreaking and, at times, humorous documentary traces this process through the story of a wonderfully quirky and deeply connected mother-daughter duo. The film spotlights the challenges of aging caregivers of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities -- some 4.6 million Americans, 75 percent of whom live at home with family -- and details the ripple effects of Dona's disability on three generations of a Texas family.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4oVms085injA8roj4SmaBrOMXz3.jpg", "actors": ["Sophie Sartain ((voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
