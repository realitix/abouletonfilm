The last three, still teenagers, lend a summery and easy-going tone to the film, which is magnificently framed by Eug\u00e8ne Green\u2019s long-time cameraman, Raphael O\u2019Byrne. The dialogue that settles in between the younger members and those in their thirties has a rare quality, as if the difference of language \u2013 which each has had to impose on their family or on their national entourage \u2013 had almost tacitly created a secret community. Starting with the political stakes (regional languages versus centralism), the story hikes over the mountains with these new friends brought together by the filmmaker.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yjLlVojxg6dei8Bs2i0TKBhyiVC.jpg", "actors": ["Eug\u00e8ne Green ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
