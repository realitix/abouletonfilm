Freewheeling and adventurous, she is also irresponsible and reckless, pushing away the timid and the cautious, yet always falling for the romantic dreams of the love-conquers-minor-details-like-my-lover\u2019s-married-status variety. After a spectacular break-up with a co-worker, Eun-jin shares a cab ride with Kim Hyeon-seok, a nerdish, awkward young man. Against all odds, they begin a courtship and eventually decide to get married. One night, however, Eun-jin finds a suspicious text message sent to her paramour\u2019s smartphone. Angered, she enlists the help of her female cop friend So-young and her doofus ex-marine brother Eun-gyul to get to the bottom of what she suspects is Hyeon-seok\u2019s two-timing affair. What she finds out, however, is something else altogether.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4vwNhz2JLZKfg6gIoO26jK4hnjb.jpg", "actors": ["Song Sae-byuk (Hyun-suk)", "Kang Ye-won (Eun-Jin)", "Grina Park (So-Young)", "Kim Hyun-joon (Park Eun-Gyeol)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "D9WB8XdGV-s"}
