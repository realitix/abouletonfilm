It turns out that trumpet player Herb Alpert is the only other performer listed in the credits who is actually there in person. The others appear in clips, some from their own U.S. Savings Bonds spots, others from unidentified movie or TV appearances. Singer Barbara McNair is shown entertaining U.S. troops in Viet Nam, and the youth group The Young Americans also sings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4hdkmLEq5dO5XW7BuP6968wqmrW.jpg", "actors": ["Dan Rowan (Himself)", "Dick Martin (Himself)", "Herb Alpert (Himself)", "Dan Blocker (Himself)", "Les Brown (Himself)", "Carol Burnett (Herself)", "Doris Day (Herself (archive footage))", "Phyllis Diller (Herself)", "Kirk Douglas (Himself)", "Lorne Greene (Himself)", "Andy Griffith (Himself)", "Charlton Heston (Himself)", "Bob Hope (Himself)", "Don Knotts (Himself)", "Michael Landon (Himself)", "Dean Martin (Himself)", "Barbara McNair (Herself)", "George Peppard (Himself)", "The Young Americans (Themselves)", "Jack Valenti (Himself)", "Vicki Lawrence (Herself / Member of the Young Americans (un-credited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
