It was an adapted Screenplay written by Oliver Stone which won him his first Oscar.\r\n\r\nGeorgia Maroda (spelling)soundtrack is really riveting as the \u2018chase\u2019 scene unfolds.\r\nThis is a movie that will stay with you for life.\r\n\r\nThey say that \u2018Midnight Express\u2019 did to Turkeys tourism, what \u2018Jaws\u2019 did to bathing in the sea.\r\n\r\nHighly recommended."}], "recommandations_id": [1632, 1051, 3116, 10518], "youtube_key": "eAY4aADKk08"}
