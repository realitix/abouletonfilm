Now even more widely known thanks to his work in Deep Purple, he spends his spare time... touring! His band Dixie Dregs hit the road whenever they and Steve have the time. This Blu Ray captures them performing in America as well as members of the Dregs backing Steve at an earlier show. With a generous running time, extras, and remastered audio options, it's one no Steve Morse fan should be without. Two full live shows, recorded in 2001 and 1992. Recorded live on the 29th November, 2001, and in New York in 2002, this DVD is an excellent introduction to the world of Steve Dregs and his immaculate country sounds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bf5O9nJdDVMSVMJYl7p8iqmQOBD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
