Six people jump off seeking asylum: four Jews, a French child, and a German soldier. They seek temporary refuge with a couple who run a village inn. They pose as a family: the deserter as husband, Judith as his wife, an old man from Vienna as her father, his granddaughter and the French lad, whom they beg to keep silent, as their children. Judith's teenage brother poses as a soldier. The fabrication unravels through chance and the local constable's exact investigation. Whom will the Swiss allow to stay? Who gets deported?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j3WhNDxAxqzaCIWfez4QKkGX46O.jpg", "actors": ["Tina Engel (Judith Krueger)", "Hans Diehl (Hannes Krueger)", "Mathias Gn\u00e4dinger (Franz Flueckiger)", "Curt Bois (Lazar Ostrowskij)", "Martin Walz (Olaf Landau)", "Ilse Bahrs (Mrs. Ostrowskij)", "Gerd David (Karl Schneider)", "Simone (Gitty)", "Laurent (Maurice)", "Renate Steiger (Anna Flueckinger)", "Michael Gempart (Landj\u00e4ger Bigler)", "Klaus Steiger (Reverend Hochdorfer)", "Alice Bruengger (Frau Hochdorfer)", "Otto Dornbierer (Otti)", "Monika Koch (Rosemarie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
