Knowing nothing about plumbing, they answer Mr. Skunkem's ad for plumber's assistants, and are sent to the Dinwitty estate to recover a diamond ring from a drain pipe. In due course they destroy the bathroom, and switch the gas and water lines, disrupting Mrs. Dinwitty's bridge party, Vanillia's dinner preparation, and the gardener's lawn watering.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["El Brendel (Axel Swenson)", "Shemp Howard (Elmer Peabody)", "Beatrice Blinn (Bridge Party Lady (uncredited))", "Heinie Conklin (Elvis - Groundskeeper (uncredited))", "Willa Pearl Curtis (Vanillia--Cook (uncredited))", "Kathryn Keys (Mrs. Dinwitty (uncredited))", "Judy Malcolm (Bridge Player on Right (1st scene) (uncredited))", "Billy Mitchell (Pinkerton--Butler (uncredited))", "Jean Murray (Bridge Party Lady (uncredited))", "Brian O'Hara (Policeman (uncredited))", "Joe Palma (Minor Role (uncredited))", "John Tyrrell (Judge / Plumbing Store Customer (uncredited))", "Al Thompson (A.
