For Julieta Vitullo, the protagonist of this film, this tragic history becomes deeply personal 25 years later when she suffers a loss associated with her search to uncover that past, unfolding into a life-affirming struggle for renewal and rebirth. This film tells the story of two trips, one made in 2006 and the other in 2010. In the space between one trip and the next, between past and present, between the public and the private, between what can and cannot be told, the movie reflects on the possibilities of conveying extreme life experiences, presenting landscapes and sounds that suggest subtle contours of that shape, 'The Exact Shape of the Islands.'", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gX33yanTayaQ7ew3TgbMsm8qUGd.jpg", "actors": ["Dacio Agretti ()", "Daniel Casabe ()", "Edgardo Dieleke ()", "Carlos Enriori ()", "John Fowler ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "_2bVaGhlUNk"}
