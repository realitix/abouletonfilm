The title indicates the place and progress of the film: it is a three-minute single shot, filmed in Spadina Road in the north of Toronto. We follow the transition from a close-up to a wide shot, all with the fluidity of a long dolly shot that is carefully developed. The movement begins with a reverse dolly shot, going from details of leaves on a tree to a wide shot of an urban landscape, then zooms towards a building and ends on an image of a woman taking some fresh air on her balcony.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
