Born from some magic stones that fell to Earth a long time ago when Goddess N\u00fcwa mended the sky, Sun Wukong, aka Monkey King, lives on Flower-Fruit Mountain, where he leads a community of other monkeys with his magical powers. One day, after breaking his halberd, he learns he can get a new one from Dragon King of the Eastern Sea, whom he visits in his underwater lair. Annoyed that Monkey King doesn't find any of his halberds heavy enough, Dragon King tells him he can borrow anything he can pick up, and Monkey King makes off with a massive pillar - the Sea-Calming Gold-Banded Cudgel - which Dragon King had used to pin down the ocean. Monkey King is able to shrink and expand it to any size he wants. Infuriated, Dragon King petitions Celestial Jade Emperor for the return of the cudgel, and the latter, on the advice of God of the Great White Star, sends an envoy summoning Monkey King to his presence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mod4eoZ8xVk9k9djeY9plvQMuR6.jpg", "actors": ["Chen Dao-Ming (\u7389\u5e1d)", "Yang Li (\u5b59\u609f\u7a7a)", "Peisi Chen (\u571f\u5730\u516c\u516c)", "Zhang Guoli (\u592a\u767d\u91d1\u661f)", "Liu Ye (\u6258\u5854\u674e\u5929\u738b)", "He Jiong (\u54ea\u5412)", "Yao Chen (\u5927\u4ed9\u5973)", "Chen Kaige (\u4e1c\u6d77\u9f99\u738b)", "Liu Xiaoqing (\u738b\u6bcd\u5a18\u5a18)", "Hu Ge ()", "Zhou Li-Bo (\u9a6c\u5929\u541b)", "Feng Xiaogang ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
