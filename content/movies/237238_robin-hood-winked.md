Bluto is the tax collector, and Olive is the owner/barmaid at the local pub. Bluto comes to the pub to collect 100% taxes and falls for Olive, who he tries to impress with trick archery, but Popeye/Robin makes a fool of him. Since he can't win fair, he cheats, by serving Popeye a root beer spiked with \"Ye Olde Michael Finn.\" With Popeye out cold, he dashes off with Olive, but Little John feeds Popeye his spinach, and Popeye races off to the castle, turning the armored knights into a cast-iron stove. Bluto carries Olive up a spiral staircase, but Popeye screws it into the ground, and they all ride off with Bluto acting as their beast of burden.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
