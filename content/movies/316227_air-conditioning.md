It\u2019s the great social destabilizer, a stigma that makes the haves seem better and the have-nots hang their heads in shame. It causes people to do things, reprehensible things, just to keep from drowning in debt, and it offers the slightest glimmer of hope for those who really haven\u2019t a chance in Hell of ever seeing a substantial payday. The crass class distinctions created, the undeniable stress of being without and the immoral drive of having too much, sets the stage for some of our most complex and compelling stories. Giuseppe Andrews clearly agrees. His amazing masterpiece, Air Conditioning, takes a neo-realistic look at how far certain citizens will go to enjoy the simple comforts of civilization - said acts including, lying, cheating, and most horrifically, murder.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f63lzdvzbRTDEBMB17dq5OmP9m8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
