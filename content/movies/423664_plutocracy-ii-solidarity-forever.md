Its subtitle refers to a 1915 song composed by Ralph Chaplin as an anthem for unionized workers. The film itself is the cinematic version of that anthem, as it allows us a comprehensive understanding of the need for these early labor unions, and the enormous sacrifices of its members to ensure fairness, safety, and equality in the workplace.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zEhuRRLA7wB6W1uowaH1dirnE71.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
