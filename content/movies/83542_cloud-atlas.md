I'm still unclear as to the point of it all.\r\n\r\nAnother issue I had was a general feeling of goofiness. Sure, the Cavendish story was pure comedy but the rest of the stories just didn't feel serious enough to me.\r\n\r\nIt carried my attention for the 172 minutes well enough and it was entertaining. I just expected more of a pay off at the end.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it's definitely worth seeing but I still haven't made up my mind if I truly liked it or not.
