Paul embarks on a rollicking, downright dangerous and often unhinged quest across the continent, riding an environmentally friendly motorcycle which was built on a shoestring budget by University of Adelaide students. For a guy who spent twenty years in the oil industry, its a delicious irony, especially since Pauls around-the- continent ride is sponsored by oil service companies. When Paul Carter is involved, there is always bound to be a high-octane adventure and this journey is no exception. This is the story of one man, one bike, and one hell of a ride.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6ExIoKmdxI4QBe6uHhEtIT6SR4M.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
