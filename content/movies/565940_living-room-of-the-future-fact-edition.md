OBM allows programme content to change according to unique interactions with audiences. The \u2018objects\u2019 in OBM refer to the different assets within a given programme. These include large objects like audio and video used to construct a scene in a drama, and small objects, like an individual frame of video, a caption, or a signer. By breaking down a piece of media into separate objects, attaching meaning to each object, and describing how they can be semantically rearranged, a programme can change to reflect an individual viewer\u2019s unique context.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5zBYuQ8POx7TaeTdmypHhQyLAA6.jpg", "actors": ["Leila Ladhari (Affective Character 1)", "Khaleila Hisham (Affective Character 2)", "Jasmine Raymond (Affective Character 3)", "Theodor Spiridon (Affective Character 4/Voice)", "Hannah Cecily (Voice)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "N19I0_1Q0zQ"}
