He takes romantic interest in an adorable local butcher (Nancy Travis) whom he increasingly suspects of (you guessed it) being an axe murderer. Amanda Plummer plays her sister and Anthony LaPaglia a detective pal of the poet. Debi Mazar has a glorified cameo as the cop\u2019s girlfriend.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I Married an Axe Murderer\u201d (1993) is amusing enough to watch at home, but I wouldn\u2019t go out and pay money for it. It\u2019s cute & comical and works up some quality suspense regarding the core question (Is she or isn\u2019t she?) and the writers came up with a worthwhile climax. Enough said.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 33 minutes and was shot in San Francisco, Oakland and Cloverdale, California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"}], "recommandations_id": [11718, 10859, 8873, 2107]}
