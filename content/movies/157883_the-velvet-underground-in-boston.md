Sudden in-and-out zooms, sweeping panning shots, in-camera edits that create single frame images and bursts of light like paparazzi flash bulbs going off mirror the kinesthetic experience of the Exploding Plastic Inevitable, with its strobe lights, whip dancers, colorful slide shows, multi-screen projections, liberal use of amphetamines, and overpowering sound. It is a significant find indeed for fans of the Velvets, being one of only two known films with synchronous sound of the band performing live, and this the only one in color.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j6eeYhIWyMq1HR1cUhixLQcnLmZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
