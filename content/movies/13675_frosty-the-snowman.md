Realizing that newly-living Frosty will melt in spring unless he takes refuge in a colder climate, Frosty and Karen, a young girl who he befriends, stow away on a freight train headed for the north pole. Little do they know that the magician is following them, and he wants his hat back!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zs6epslSJK2qgDJPm4Aa88zkkTW.jpg", "actors": ["Jimmy Durante (Narrator (voice))", "Billy De Wolfe (Professor Hinkle (voice))", "Jackie Vernon (Frosty the Snowman (voice))", "Paul Frees (Santa Claus / Traffic Cop / Additional Voices (voice))", "June Foray (Teacher / Karen / Additional Voices (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [13400, 13382, 18846, 28042], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
