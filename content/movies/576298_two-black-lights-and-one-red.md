Featuring live actors and digital avatars, the story is about the last day of a blind poet, Max Starpower. The project is a universe where tragedy, sarcasm, and comedy are portrayed as a deformed and apocalyptic mirror of reality; In this world, circumstance is the source of tragedy, and the grimace produced by this tragedy is what rules its form.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cuIOG8eiG3fVnPrv7q5HcGma2gv.jpg", "actors": ["Nikki Calonge (Donatino)", "Modesto Flako Jimenez (Max Starpower)", "Christine Schisano (Claudia / Collette / Ruben Dario)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
