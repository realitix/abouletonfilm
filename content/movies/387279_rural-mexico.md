In Mazatl\u00e1n, away from the tourist spots, we see a small village where fishing, growing coconuts, and gathering large sea turtles are the main pursuits. We then visit Toluca on market day, where people sell produce and pottery. The last stop is Taxco, where the Castilian influence of the Spanish conquerors is still prevalent.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hXkZH46ps9C7cqV8cl6SLVqpmKp.jpg", "actors": ["James A.
