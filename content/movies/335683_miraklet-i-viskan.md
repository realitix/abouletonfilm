Across the river lives Bjarnes father Halvar. The two have never pulled evenly, which stems from a 20-year conflict filled with idle words, grumpy pride and stubborn prestige.

A decision that will have unexpected consequences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9xEEaqFbIepN0tEnjVGYDxIFnKX.jpg", "actors": ["Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd (Bjarne)", "Lia Boysen (Malin)", "Ingvar Hirdwall (Halvar)", "Marika Lindstr\u00f6m (Gerda)", "Ivan Mathias Petersson (Jarmo)", "Mats Blomgren ()", "Michael Segerstr\u00f6m (Grape)", "Lena Str\u00f6mdahl (Anny)", "Elisabet Carlsson (Irma Andler)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
