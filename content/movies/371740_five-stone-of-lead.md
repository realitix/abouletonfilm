Dylan is driven, self-possessed, articulate and an unassuming charmer. He cites Rocky IV as the inspiration for his perseverance and resilience, and even seems to have borrowed his intensive training routine from the Italian Stallion. He\u2019s currently so light that he must carry the titular five stone (70lb) of lead in his saddle to be heavy enough to control his horse. As we watch him try to buff up and rise to the top of his game, it\u2019s impossible not to be won over by his determination and dedication. The boys face additional hardship as the grip of recession in Ireland means horses are scarcer, but Dylan remains optimistic and cheerful, grinning from ear to ear.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o92HMpRoCPQ73fFlKv9Q1ABS8yY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
