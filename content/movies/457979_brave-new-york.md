The movie's main voices are those of the artists and street people whose wisdom and commentaries upon the dominant culture give us pause amidst the speedy approach of a \"Brave New World.\"  This Overview was taken from Fandor, where this film is available. 2004.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g3KMxb5XnFVeKCaQuYUmA4UrJE2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
