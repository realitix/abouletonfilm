Thelma has prepared some rules, including singing whenever one feels quarrelsome or angry. Although Thelma tells Patsy that they'll share everything, there's precious little closet or drawer space for Patsy's clothes, little room to maneuver around Thelma in the bathroom, and then a sleepless night for Patsy when Thelma goes sleepwalking. Can they share and share alike, or will Patsy keep on singing?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rQFgqo64OKyf11W5rwzDUzmw9GI.jpg", "actors": ["Thelma Todd (Thelma)", "Patsy Kelly (Patsy)", "Harry Bowen (Hotel Clerk (uncredited))", "Charlie Hall (Porter (uncredited))", "Arthur Housman (Drunk (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
