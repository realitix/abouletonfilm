One night, eighteen-year-old Harry Jukes (British rock 'n roller Adam Faith in his first dramatic role) is driving down a deserted country road when he gets a flat tire. A policeman stops to help him out when a truck drives by, and the next thing Harry knows, the policeman is lying dead on the road and Harry is literally holding a smoking gun in his hand. From there to his arrest and trial is a brief hop, skip, and then a jump into prison to await his execution. His lawyer thinks he did it, but his psychiatrist (Anne Baxter) disagrees -- and sets out to prove she is right.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cN3pI01B4Dd80SY5Elr7eCbUpSI.jpg", "actors": ["Anne Baxter (Dr. Anne Dyson)", "Donald Sinden (Philip Bellamy, QC)", "Adam Faith (Harry Jukes)", "Walter Brown (Max Taplow)", "Jack MacGowran (Terence)", "Topsy Jane (Mona)", "Carole Ann Ford (Jen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [86790, 238730, 65487, 36458], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
