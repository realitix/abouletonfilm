When Berolli thinks that nightclub owner Cassell is complaining that business is bad to avoid giving Berolli his full take, Lucky goes to the club's laundry and proves that Cassell is lying by counting the number of napkins the club has washed. Lucky threatens him, and Cassell decides to go to the police. Lieutenant McFarley and Sergeant Brent, who have been after Lucky and Berolli, go to arrest Lucky; but he slips away from them and is wounded by Brent as he drives off.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zzUmp9KTR6EqVD8e2efyB1FsDTB.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Sterling ('Lucky' Wilson)", "Marsha Hunt (Pauline Miller)", "Virginia Weidler (Lizzie Miller)", "Paul Kelly (Lieutenant McFarley)", "Fay Holden (Mrs. Miller)", "Henry Travers (Mr. Miller)", "Don Costello (Police Sergeant Brent)", "Carol Hughes (Sally Travers)", "Reed Hadley (Tony Berolli)", "Ben Welden (Dr. Anderson)", "Theodore von Eltz (Cassell)", "Leon Belasco (Mr. Lapagos, the Tailor)", "Mitchell Lewis (Alfred 'Al')", "Joe Yule (Little 'Butch')", "Eddie Hart (Joseph 'Joe')", "Jerry Jerome (Pete)", "Steve Darrell (Napkin Counter)", "William Tannen (Driver)", "Veda Ann Borg (Manicurist (uncredited))", "Patricia Dane (Blonde in Elevator (uncredited))", "Charles Judels (A.
