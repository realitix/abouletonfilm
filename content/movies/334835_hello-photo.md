She takes us to India and abandons us there, leaving us to believe what we see through her eyes. Her movie replicates the experience of being a traveller and thus a voyeur, of taking in sights without necessarily understanding their meaning. Davenport seems less interested in cracking the enigma of India than in savoring it...Her hunger makes her unashamed, like the eager children who find the eye of her camera the next best thing to sweets.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kzcjY3veIr5oDXKpUysG4WaTdVG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
