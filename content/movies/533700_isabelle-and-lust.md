But Isabelle is not the mentally balanced young lady she seems to be. In fact she is doubly traumatized, firstly by the rape she suffered eight years before from a Nazi officer and secondly by the suicide of her father shortly after. What she wants deep inside herself is to find a man, young or less young, who will bring her tenderness and happiness. Will Luc, a young German, or Monsieur Vaudois, her married boss, give her what she lacks ?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3JVsQMhRw3aQLjKZebxaUR37Xps.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
