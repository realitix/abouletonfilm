During the trip she will meet the following people: A couple of thieves of international renown, an impoverished marquis and his undercover woman. A disinherited adventurer, and two undercover police agents. Bored and lonely, the beautiful woman accepts the courtmanship of three men she meets on the train: First, an American businessman, then a Hapsburgic officer, and lastly a Spanish bullfighter.
