We see hands close up: working, playing, praying, whittling, and strumming. Hands use saws and hammers, lift stones, turn wheels, then write, type, apply a bandage, play a violin, use a compass, and hold a U.S. Treasury note. Hands put a shoe on a customer, shake a thermometer, and count out bills and coins into other waiting hands. A hand places an engagement ring on a finger, buys a movie ticket, and reels in a fishing line. There are multiple images repeating what we've seen. A chicken is basted; other chickens get grain. It's a national celebration.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sX1mKj6w3zMc1yBUlhnN7McFBLn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
