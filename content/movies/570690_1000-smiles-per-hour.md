Into their deepest desires and fears. Into their humanity. But what about yourself? Who are you? You walk the streets towards a destination we do not know. You meet a woman whose relationship to you is unclear. You remain a ghost, who needs to wash off make-up, a mask, a second personality which you squeeze yourself into for a couple of hours every day. You're the one who smiles for us, who shows us who we are and who disappears in the shadow of ourselves.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["E (Esth)", "Julie Trappett (Mar)", "Alexander Wissel (Jester)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
