Surprises and challenges ensue, including drama with Alfreda's envious sister Mona Levi (Vivica A. Fox); the revelation of a deep, dark family secret involving Alfreda's former acquaintance Chivonne Price (Tichina Arnold); and dealings with Leighton's super-loud, outspoken cousin Nelson Royal (Ricky Harris). Unfortunately, Leighton and Alfreda both play their roles too well as old wounds are re-opened and their carefully planned reunion leads to chaos - and a potentially real break-up.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oLbSfLlP33iebdLRPc7mR7ukZ3c.jpg", "actors": ["Vivica A.
