Peter Rowan was a bluegrass boy in the 1960's for only a short time, but Bill's influence and musical knowledge still resonates with Peter. Even as he branched out into his own music after leaving Bill's band, his bluegrass roots were never far away. This portrait of Peter expands beyond his music to his artistic and spiritual endeavors spanning four decades giving the viewer an in-depth look at a true legend within our Americana musical history. His lyrical quality and melodies are memorable; influencing the next generation of musicians, sharing what Bill taught him and what he has learned being a troubadour traveling the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gRnQ5lldJjBEj15K7WtVvJAcDb8.jpg", "actors": ["Steve Earle ()", "Alison Krauss ()", "Ricky Skaggs ()", "Jack Casady ()", "Vassar Clements ()", "Tony Rice ()", "Peter Rowan (Documentary Subject)", "Wavy Gravy ()", "Hot Buttered Rum String Band ()", "Billy Bright ()", "Amanda Rowan ()", "Manose Singh ()", "Sharon Gilchrist ()", "David Grisman ()", "Jody Stecher ()", "Richard Greene ()", "Chris Rowan ()", "Lorin Rowan ()", "David Nelson ()", "Chojje Tulku Rinpoche ()", "Jerry Douglas ()", "Tim O'Brien ()", "Bryn Davies ()", "Sam Bush ()", "Drew Emmitt ()", "Laurie Lewis ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ih-NOxFNsI4"}
