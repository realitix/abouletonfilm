Amongst the swarms of people that crowd the streets like extras, Fayaaz Bijli is another face relegated to the background of our visual spectrum. Come sundown, however, and the inconspicuous Fayaaz morphs into the iconic personae of \u2018Bijli,\u2019 a voluptuous Pakistani drags queen. Yet beneath the flamboyant stage presence lies a courageous individual who has carved out a unique and cherished identity for herself in a world that has been all too quick to label her as an \u2018outsider\u2019. Defining herself as a woman stuck in a man\u2019s body, Fayaaz has spent her life struggling between the polar tensions of male/female, East/West and Islamic faith/promiscuity. This film is a glimpse into Fayaaz\u2019s psyche as she navigates her way through a New York City life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gv2ZUuArCImOzVpUAG2U29xekrv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "OLZ4ozPBTwc"}
