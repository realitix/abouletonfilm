In these jokey short films, many of them crudely animated, Kago's sick sense of humor reaches its full heights of absurdity. There's a playful surrealist sensibility to Kago's work, as well as a tendency to revel in the ridiculous, the crude and the disturbing. His work straddles a weird boundary between avant-garde experimentation and low-brow fart jokes \u2014 the punchline of one of these films is literally an oozing torrent of shit \u2014 although, admittedly, his videos seem to lean a bit more heavily towards the fart jokes than his comics. But hey, who doesn't appreciate a good fart joke once in a while?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9ma6wzmdU2McbcTIfkSYZ8H7v9h.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
