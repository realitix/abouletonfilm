Shot in Dakar and Alaska, Mille Soleils mystifies as it searches for an origin, its lineage and its transcendent deviations, flouting its own premise as fantasy merges with reality: the sad-eyed cattle herder who embodied the seminal role in Touki-Bouki forty years ago is now filled with longing for the vanished past and a future that was never meant to be. A film of haunting beauty, both sensuous and febrile, Mille Soleils is intimate and raw but also refreshingly quixotic, and confirms Mati Diop as a major cinematic talent.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6xbzwzceGfjk8jQhOG0a4eNG9uS.jpg", "actors": ["Magaye Niang (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
