For three days, more than a thousand children and adults were held hostage in a sweltering gymnasium, denied food and water, and forced to keep their hands over their heads. The harrowing siege ended on September 3 with a series of explosions and a hail of gunfire that killed some 350 people - half of them children. In this film, the youngest survivors of Beslan tell their story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hsbG6RnQylVfXqWEIH2AFIRiCRx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
