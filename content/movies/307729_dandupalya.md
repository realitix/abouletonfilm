She goes to the house asking for water. When the women go inside, the entire gang led by Krishna (Makarand Deshpande) and followed by Hanuma (Ravi Kale), Thimma (Jaidev), Muniya (Karisubbu) and others enter the house and kill women. Krishna takes thrill in slitting the throats as he is fond of the noise that comes out from the throat when blood oozes out. Then they loot the house and escape. They are all shabbily dressed, rough and tough. Inspector Chalapathi (P. Ravishankar) takes up the challenge of arresting them. Thimma was carrying stolen Temple ornaments. He was rejected by the jeweller, while getting back trapped by Ravi shankar and all of them would be arrested by police and submits to the court.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aJjnPUiA6IyAV9ISUNe18EiG9qt.jpg", "actors": ["Pooja Gandhi (Lakshmi)", "Raghu Mukherjee ()", "Priyanka Kothari (Wife of Raghu)", "Makrand Deshpande (Krishna)", "Ravi Kale (Hanuma)", "Jayadev Mohan (Koti Thimma)", "Sudharani (Wife of Inspector Chalapathi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ZHUx7-dEe2w"}
