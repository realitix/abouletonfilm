Jean-Daniel Cadinot descends with his cameras for the first time. His lens captures the initiation of an inexperienced youth into the sensuous and decadent world of Venetian nobility as it feasts upon the willing bodies of the young and beautiful. Virtually non-stop sex is masterfully intertwined with the touching story of a young man breaking away.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q7sr60L3uV6HQUr9dy5NDwPLX3S.jpg", "actors": ["Benjamin Fontenay (Julien)", "Yannick Baud (Romeo)", "Anton Pirus (Silvio)", "Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Chapel (Mother (non-sexual))", "Robert Marsan (Father (non-sexual))", "G\u00e9rard Nemour (The Baron (non-sexual))", "Fran\u00e7ois Chatelain (The Narrator (non-sexual))", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lemaire (The Room Valet)", "Carla Da Cino (Helena (non-sexual))", "Antonella Contini (Isabella (non-sexual))", "Giuseppe Velli (The Client)", "Dja\u00ef Kamara (A Friend Of Romeo)", "Giovani Morano (Flavio)", "Sydney McKenna (A Friend Of Romeo)", "Damiano Martini (A Friend Of Romeo)", "Jacques Auvray (The Initiate)", "Jacques de Rives (Romeo's Double)", "Michel Juvet (A Guest Of The Baron)", "Marius Sainte-Rose (A Guest Of The Baron)", "Claude Leveau (A Guest Of The Baron)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
