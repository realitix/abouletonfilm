The camera catches the subjects indulging in all the (post) modern lifestyle trends: drugs, kinky sex, hip-hop, fashion, exhibitionism, narcissism. They are uninhibited, the kind of youth who break down barriers in a supposedly traditional and religious society, but perhaps that's just on the surface. Behind the upbeat tone is a probing examination of values and attitudes in modern youth relationships. Happiness may be deceptive but there's certainly a lot of fun in the Happy Berry.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6t2fFgiLWOFlM5DnVd9xfKuCGdV.jpg", "actors": ["Chatthip Chanlertfa (Tird)", "Wanwimon Nuntavijarn (Gack)", "Roampol Rochanakit (Jo)", "Chayathip Rungpungtong (Koi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
