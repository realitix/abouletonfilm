Recalling the history of Morocco and those who tried in earnest to affect change, the experiential nature of the film allows for an interesting perspective on a common story and setting. This film is an allegory of memory: an erratic recollection of shared experiences, feelings, and thoughts that shape a coherent narrative.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
