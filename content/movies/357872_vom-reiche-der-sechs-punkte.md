The story deals with a steel worker who looses the sight of his eyes and has to accept his fate. The film shows in unique documentary pictures the work and life in the homes for the blind in Cologne, Neuwied and D\u00fcren. The Filmmuseum Muenchen has restored the only surviving tinted and toned print of the film which was found in the collection of the Finnish Film Archive.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5BrQJeXkYQE1Bg61Modng56GDyp.jpg", "actors": ["Hubert Horbach ()", "Lotte Kleinschmidt (Luise K\u00f6rner)", "Heinrich Langen ()", "Josef Mainz ()", "Herr Metzler ()", "Johannes Nie\u00dfen ()", "Josef Petri ()", "Robert Wirtz ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
