Marshall, who represented the Americans at Plum Village in Nanjing.  A lost notebook stirred the already turbulent peace talk. The ripples alert the three sides and a battle of spy and anti-spy began. Many historical figures like Zhou Enlai, George Marshall, Chiang Kai-shek, Soong May-ling, He Yingqing, Chen Cheng, and Hu Zongnan are depicted in the movie. Other fictional persona such as the ace agent Xiong Huiquan, the female journalist, and a secret spy who belongs to the Confidential Bureau adds tension to the critical moment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/75HZe1zVEvYp8xDFHvQdtlHIdDQ.jpg", "actors": ["Sun Weimin (Zhou Enlai)", "Murray Clive Walker (Colonel Browder)", "Tony Vingerhoets (General Marshall)", "Jiang Qin Qin (KMT Agent)", "Andrew Lane Cawthon (Lock Vader)", "Randall Lowell (John Leighton Stuart)", "Elyse Ribbons (Reporter Margaret)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
