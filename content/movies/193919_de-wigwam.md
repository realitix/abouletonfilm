He made a script and used a camera from his father's shop. This became his first film, Wigwam, with his own family as cast. Black Eagle, a bad Indian, kidnaps the daughter of a farmer's family. Flaming Arrow, played by the young director, saves the child from the kidnapper and brings her back to her family. No better conclusion than smoking a peace pipe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ojd7zooYgnlTTTS90XaZyvFApF3.jpg", "actors": ["Joris Ivens (Flaming Arrow)", "Peter Ivens (Black Eagle)", "Dorothea Ivens ()", "Hans Ivens ()", "Jacoba Ivens ()", "Theodora Ivens ()", "Willem Ivens ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [186164, 163890, 187879, 189943], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
