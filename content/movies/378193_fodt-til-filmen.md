Through interviews with herself, with her family - Ann Bierlich (mother), Asger Leth (brother), J\u00f8rgen Leth (stepfather), friends and people from the film industry it tells us about Stine's life from being a child actress to becoming a celebrated young star of the 80's.  The film is a comment on today's worshipping of stars, and how fame has almost become a drug in itself. It\u2019s as if here\u2019s every answer to any doubt.  But as Stine's story shows, reality can actually be the opposite.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Stine Bierlich (Herself)", "Ann Bierlich (Herself)", "Simon Bang (Himself)", "Jon Bang Carlsen (Himself)", "J\u00f8rgen Leth (Himself)", "Asger Leth (Himself)", "Anders Refn (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
