In fact, \"Every Pixel Tells a Story\" is an example of what can be accomplished on digital video. Producer-director Peter Hanson shot and edited the movie in a matter of weeks using a camcorder, a computer editing system, and a $30 microphone from Radio Shack, all while spending a fraction of what the documentary would have cost had it been shot on film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2lBK1ZNpioqJMj1Cm32aRyLZ30K.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
