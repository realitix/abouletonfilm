Unfortunately, all they found was each other... In a last ditch effort to save their struggling relationship, the duo twist their couples' counseling therapy into a plot that would see them turning back into their Texas low-life roots as petty criminals. As has been the case throughout the history of Rick and Reni's calamity plagued relationship, their haphazard scheme to hold up a dive bar goes horribly wrong.
