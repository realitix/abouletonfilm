In hurrying and neglecting an infection on my right thumb, I had to film more or less with one hand and then spend two days in hospital. I can only think that the making of this little film reflects all the difficulties previously faced by Yann himself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8umn2L2pKtZZBRvBYXoYSBh7afZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
