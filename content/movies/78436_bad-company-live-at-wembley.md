There was magic in the air as all three original Bad Company members - vocalist extraordinaire Paul Rodgers, guitarist Mick Ralphs and drummer Simon Kirke - are augmented by bassist Lynn Sorensen and guitarist Howard Leese. (Original bassist Boz Burrell died in 2006.) The set list is packed with every major hit, fan favorites and seldom-heard deep album cuts.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h3UnshYKFVk36tz4TZ9CE1cLfrq.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Rodgers (Himself)", "Mick Ralphs (Himself)", "Simon Kirke (Himself)", "Howard Leese (Himself)", "Lynn Sorensen (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
