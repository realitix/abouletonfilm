Set in beautiful Montr\u00e9al, a group of twenty-somethings struggle through the misguided awkwardness that comes with early romance. Bryce meets a French girl one day in the city. Jules runs into an old flame he has secretly been in love with for years. Blake realizes that his friend's sister is suddenly \"all grown up\" and these young men are forced to come to grips with the unknown... women. In the quirky vein of \"Diner\" and \"The Brothers McMullen,\" this ensemble-driven comedy will endear itself to anyone who has suffered and savored being a young adult.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cso2s5OBUhF5Jsjl2nPQteosnIL.jpg", "actors": ["Steven Crowder (Blake)", "Jordan Crowder (Bryce)", "Julian Di Nardo (Jules)", "Julian Di Nardo (Andrew)", "Cindy Boisvert (Genevi\u00e8ve)", "Timothy Cormier (Danny)", "Sonia Swift (June)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Ogj5nZRHbAQ"}
