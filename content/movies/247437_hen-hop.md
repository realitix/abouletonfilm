One of a number of drawn-on-film animated works created by McLaren, Hen Hop was animated by inking and scraping film stock, with colour added optically afterwards.  To make Hen Hop, McLaren spent days in a chicken coop to capture what he called \"the spirit of henliness.\" The film was produced by the National Film Board of Canada.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wo5KIsi3NfrbE8n2HTBoWFvW8DC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [291086, 163890, 263875, 189943], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
