Early in his regime, the resources and agricultural products his country sells command high prices, and he is a reasonably confident, even gentle, ruler who likes to take long vacations with his daughter in Paris. After World War I, with falling prices and a number of coup attempts behind him, his rule becomes quite cruel.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eVKD8CcIqjRn9pglyvkOHGrsg2q.jpg", "actors": ["Katy Jurado ()", "Nelson Villagra ()", "Ernesto G\u00f3mez Cruz ()", "Reynaldo Miravalles ()", "Ra\u00fal Pomares ()", "Salvador S\u00e1nchez ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
