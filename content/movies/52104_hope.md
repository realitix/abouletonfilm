When one of his horses is killed by an automobile, and when it is clear that neither justice nor charity will prevail, the man, played by G\u00fcney, begins a slow slide into despair. On the advice of a local holy man, and fuelled by an indefatigable optimism, he sets out into the desert in quest of a mythical lost treasure, slipping further and further into that final, ineluctable moment where hope itself becomes the last terrible delusion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xShhRKRcJ6aFI6kaIXnXdEsLhSL.jpg", "actors": ["Tuncel Kurtiz (Hasan)", "Y\u0131lmaz G\u00fcney (Cabbar)", "G\u00fclsen Alnia\u00e7ik (Fatma)", "K\u00fcrsat Alnia\u00e7ik (Memet Emin)", "Osman Alyanak (H\u00fcseyin Hodja, the imam)", "Enver D\u00f6nmez (The pickpocket)", "Sema Engin (Cemile)", "Nizam Erg\u00fcden (Nizam)", "Hicret G\u00fcrson (Hicret)", "L\u00fctf\u00fc Engin (The grocer)", "Ahmet Ko\u00e7 (Ahmet, the repairman)", "Kemal Tatli (The police chief)", "Sevgi Tatli (Hatice)", "Semra Kaya ()", "Mehmet Eken ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [96051, 96049, 124611, 143729], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
