Lewis. Boss of Hangtown Mesa may not be in the same league as the Brown-Lewis classic Arizona Cyclone, but it comes awfully close. This time around, hero Steve Collins (Brown) comes to the aid of Betty Wilkins (Helen Deverell), who has taken over the telegraph-line business established by her uncle John (Henry Hall). The latter was murdered by outlaws who don't cotton to having the territory linked up electronically with the rest of the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/16b2vfdXcKJcUOP23BZ8jBVvks3.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Mack Brown (Steve Collins)", "Fuzzy Knight (Dr. J.
