He and an equally disreputable acquaintance rape a woman alongside the Seine, a crime made all the worse because she is pregnant. The rest of this slow-paced film deals with the consequences of that action.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8ZaJ3QpRc74MAVNUZNqRtvv9JKG.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Lonsdale (Antonie)", "Olimpia Carlisi ()", "Jean Badin ()", "Jean-Bernard Guillard ()", "Melvil Poupaud ()", "Franck Oger ()", "Kim Massee ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
