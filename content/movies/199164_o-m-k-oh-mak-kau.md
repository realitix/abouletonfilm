However, Sam and Mun's habit of stealing constantly brings trouble into their lives, if only because they are not good at it. Every time the duo goes off to rob a house, they dress up as various characters and spend time cleaning their victim's home. This drives Mama San crazy. If their shenanigans are not bad enough, when Que, a fellow villager who left for the city returns to their village, Sam and Mun both vie for her affections.
