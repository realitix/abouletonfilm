He recently lost his older brother to the war in Syria, and now lives with his family in a Lebanese refugee camp. Traumatised, overwhelmed, disengaged, he prefers to be silent. Director Soudade Kaadan\u2019s patient observation accompanies Ahmad, as he recovers a sense of childhood lightness despite his grief. Amid endless images of violence, the film poses a question about the future, and in Kaadan\u2019s words, \u201cexplores the impossibility to verbally express what is happening in Syria now.\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lwP4z1XiYQxFe6Pgu7DUCaOQqFR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
