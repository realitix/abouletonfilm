Woo-jin's mom, Hyeon-sook used to work as an erotic movie actress for a short time when she was too young to make a right decision for herself. Hyeon-sook operates a small sashimi restaurant and a bed and breakfast to make a living on the island. She lives her life like a hermit, refusing to visit the land even once. Although Hyeon-sook has sex with Bong-seong, she rejects his proposals.  Although Woo-jin and Kang-hee are lovers, Kang-hee allows kisses only, but nothing else of her body, which is against Woo-jin's wishful thinking.  Woo-jin had his first sexual encounter with Hye-ri one day who stayed at the bed and breakfast; however, it happened only in his dreams.  One day, Woo-jin is terribly shocked to accidentally see his mom Hyeon-sook and Bong-seong having sex.
