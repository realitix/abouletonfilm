Olive almost ends up in the dinosaur, but the caveman (longing for a woman) saves her. Olive falls for him, but Popeye, noticing Olive's absence, comes down and saves her from the caveman. They fight it out; the caveman stuffs Popeye into a not-quite-empty spinach can and feeds him to the dinosaur, but of course, Popeye breaks out and wins the day.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
