Miller, Lucky Ghost is amusing low-brow fare that exploits the more base, stereotypical elements of old-time black life (chicken thievin', gamblin', runnin' from ghosteses) for laughs -- sort of like the BET of its day. Mantan and Miller win a house-cum-casino in a craps game, only to discover that the deceased former owners aren't too pleased that their old home is being used for \"jitterbugging, jiving, and hullaballooing\". I hate hullaballooing. The ghosts decide to scare everyone off by opening doors and windows, pulling out chairs, even playing the drums.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ueKQamVvjSZenNBrJvvx6XfSTzS.jpg", "actors": ["Mantan Moreland (Washington)", "F.E.
