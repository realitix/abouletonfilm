On his arrival, he is greeted with the words Herzlich Willkommen, or \"cordial, heartfelt welcome.\" However, once he finds employment, what he experiences is anything but a cordial welcome at his new job, where he is a teacher/counselor for \"wayward children\" located in a former castle. The institution is headed by a former Nazi who runs it with the help of the more criminal, bullying boys. Despite these obstacles, Friedrich manages to establish a rapport with a boy who wants to go \"straight,\" and also begins to have an affair with an attractive female teacher at the school.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wD4gUGoWiW2ECwbsqnyfWeyMC6x.jpg", "actors": ["Uwe Bohm (Friedrich Dombrowski)", "Barbara Auer (Elke Kramer)", "Hark Bohm (Direktor Dr. Fischer)", "Anna Thalbach (Iris)", "Eva-Maria Hagen (Sekret\u00e4rin)", "Michael Gwisdek (Hausmeister)", "Heinz Hoenig (Iris' Vater)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
