We isolated the shots in which no character is talking: the quiet lulls in the stormy debate and the wordless reaction shots. We fashioned these silent shots into a six minute montage, adding only music and non-verbal sounds from the film. No dialogue. (Well, almost none. You\u2019ll hear).  Is the story arc still comprehensible? Can you still sense the tension and the power struggles between the twelve jurors?
