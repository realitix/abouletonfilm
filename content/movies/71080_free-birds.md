They are city birds that you can find in every tree or every corner.\" Juan: a sparrow that feels ordinary and underestimates his own race. Accidentally, he changes the way he looks, and the same reason that will make him feel unique is what is going to put his life in danger. Feifi: a beautiful canary that manages to escape from the cage of a network tycoon (Mr. Puertas), and starts trying a new life in freedom, as a common bird. Both of them will need to be something that they aren't and will face danger and adventures with their friends (Libia, the Pidgeon; Pipo, the Humming Bird; Clarita, the Bat; and some more). A clumsy cat, some psyco Southern Lapwings and Mr. Puertas will make everything even harder for them. Juan and Feifi will try to shape their destiny to feel truly free.
