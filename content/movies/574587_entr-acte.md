The images are interspersed with one another: a man and a woman are painted with white paint, while another couple is wrapped in paper and coloured with paint.  The second part of the film also consists of a performance. This time, Luyken works with life-sized, cartoon-like fantasy figures. Eventually they are numbered and wrapped in white paper.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Edward Luyken ()", "Radboud Molijn ()", "Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Breuls ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
