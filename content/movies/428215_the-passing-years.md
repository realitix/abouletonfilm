This veteran of the experimental Dutch literary movement of the early 1950s known as the Vijftigers sees himself mainly as a poet, even though he might be more famous for his columns, short stories and public performances. He has carefully created an image of himself as a charming Sunday's child, loved by everyone. But who is he really? Director John Albert spent a year with Campert, quietly documenting his everyday life (the daily game of scrabble with his wife Deborah, a cup of tea, a cigarette, a glass of wine), as well as more intimate moments such as his admission to the hospital and conversations with his daughters and friends. He turns out to be a man of few words - at least verbally - but his poems tell a story of melancholy, mortality and approaching death. Fortunately, his writing keeps him going: \"Poetry is an act of affirmation. I affirm that I am alive.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jYhTXo2bDpaly5KrtIiQ78rB9hR.jpg", "actors": ["Remco Campert (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
