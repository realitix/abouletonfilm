Dominated by her over bearing mother, Pauline battles with her sanity and unhealthy obsessions.\r\n\r\nSuperb, a teen based horror that\u2019s pungent with everything from necrophilia, growing pains, peer pressure, sexual anxiety, parental strife, mental illness and horror \u2013 real horror.  Writer/director Richard Bates Junior does a brilliant job of filling an 80 minute movie with so many thematic smarts but never once over egging his bloody pudding. He gets excellent performances out of McCord and Traci Lords (as Pauline\u2019s mother), whilst the blending of surreal imagery via Pauline\u2019s dreams and the real world awkwardness \u2013 with some dry humour in the mix too \u2013 produces a picture that is in equal parts oddball and emotionally shattering.\r\n\r\nWhen Dead Ringers collides with Ginger Snaps, Excision will stay with you for days afterwards. 9/10"}], "recommandations_id": [126277, 65599, 138941, 10894], "youtube_key": "dzKlr1V6xzM"}
