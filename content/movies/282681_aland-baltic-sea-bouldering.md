Baltic Sea Bouldering presents an insight into how climbers tackle this fresh and exciting bouldering destination. What we receive is a fascinating look at how some of Europe's best climbers tackle an unclimbed highball project that stretches mental strength to the limits.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jHJCQlM3AAbCkb1AinwILnMxmi7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
