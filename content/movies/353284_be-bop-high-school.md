Be-Bop High School drops you into the middle of brawling rival high school gangs who do little else than chase each other around with knives and baseball bats. Using local yakuza ruffians as their role models, these high school hooligans pound themselves senseless as fawning girls adore them from the sidelines. Not much plot here; just a WHOLE LOTTA fighting!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h5paDMVpH1rZDpdlZeSSD3bnF9t.jpg", "actors": ["Yousuke Daichi (Taro Omae)", "Manami Honj\u00f4 (Fumie Oyama)", "Kenichi Matsuyama (Jun Kawabata)", "Takanori Jinnai (Onijima)", "Takanori Jinnai (Hiroshi Kato)", "Nobuaki Kaneko (Shingo Maekawa)", "Tak Sakaguchi (Toshimitsu Yamada)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
