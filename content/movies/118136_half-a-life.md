He was imprisoned for a short while in 1973. Disillusioned after the failure of the demonstrations and the death of the only woman he had loved, his life seems to have changed from a period of hope and activism to one of bottomless despair. His friend, Romain Goupil wrote and directed this biographical documentary. Death at 30 received the 1982 Cannes Film Festival's Golden Camera Award for \"Best First Feature-Length Film.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1hTikwOPOr9r7PMoAkAfG5dI78W.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [198790, 199184, 78815, 92711], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
