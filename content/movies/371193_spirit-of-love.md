When her boyfriend/boss comes over and tries to get romantic, the model begins seeing weird and scary visions. Visions of blood flooding her floor, and a three year old boy ghost. It seems that, three years earlier, she was pregnant and caught her husband athletically knocking off a blonde. Husband kicked her down the stairs, which causes her to abort. The ghost is evidently the aborted baby grown up. Back to the present day, hubby has teamed up with a new girl, and is trying to get back into the house and kidnap the boy ghost.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xYOsd02dDxtq2V97sP76du8Zw9U.jpg", "actors": ["Loletta Lee (The Model)", "Poon Chun-wai ()", "Lam Wai ()", "Joanna Chan ()", "Matthew Chow Siu-Fa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
