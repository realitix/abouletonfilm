John Lewis-now a revered U.S. Congressman, then a young student-co-led hundreds of peaceful marchers seeking voting rights for African Americans in the South. When they came face to face with a wall of club-wielding Alabama state troopers, Lewis took a steadfast, non-violent stand and inspired his followers to do the same. Graphic depictions of the ensuing assault were televised on the nightly news and shocked Americans to the core as they witnessed blatant racial oppression. Get in the Way is the first documentary film biography about Lewis, the civil rights icon, respected legislator and elder statesman who continues to practice nonviolence in his determined fight for justice. The film is a riveting portrayal of John Lewis' personal journey of courage, searing disappointments and hard-won triumphs, as over the decades he inspires others to stand up and Get in the Way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lNGQQtfchkYoJ4QOhF823vXDKGZ.jpg", "actors": ["John Lewis (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
