This sublime film exemplifies La Cava\u2019s gift for creating comedies that contain a profound depth of feeling. Starting with a cruel joke \u2013 a couple of callow men make a bet that one of them can seduce the woman sharing their train compartment \u2013 the film charts the relationship that develops between Irene Dunne, a small-town girl in the big city, and Robert Montgomery, the brother of the man who has heartlessly seduced and abandoned her. Their love affair is all the more affecting for taking place against a backdrop of heartbreak and alcoholism, all conveyed under the guise of comedy. UNFINISHED BUSINESS is truly one of the most remarkable Hollywood films of the 1940s.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r03Tyq948q89TfmjRWwwpes8QYV.jpg", "actors": ["Irene Dunne (Nancy Andrews)", "Robert Montgomery (Tommy Duncan)", "Preston Foster (Steve Duncan)", "Eugene Pallette (Elmer)", "Esther Dale (Aunt Mathilda)", "Walter Catlett (Billy Ross)", "Samuel S.
