Then the car crashes into a tree, the male driver (Christian Chaix) is decapitated and the bloody, injured female (Marie-Paule Mailleux) scoops up his head and returns to her home. There, she cleans herself and the head off, prepares dinner for herself and the head, buys the head a Ken Doll to keep it company, puts the head on a mannequin's body and then has a series of strange hallucinations, which include having sex with her bloodied lover, dancing in a room by herself with a spotlight, etc. Things culminate in her having sex with the head and then throwing it into the trash bin.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qHZZo4eioqRLhFnvMo67ExbrpfU.jpg", "actors": ["Christian Chaix (Decapitated Lover)", "To Katinaki (Second lesbian girl in orgy)", "Jean-Pierre Bouyxou (Man in orgy)", "Janine Delannoy (First lesbian girl in orgy)", "Jio Berk (Man in orgy)", "Roland Lethem (Man in orgy)", "Rapha\u00ebl Marongiu (Man in orgy)", "Nicole Duport (Girl in orgy)", "Jean Taymans (Man in orgy)", "Marie-Paule Mailleux (The Woman)", "Louis Lenglet (Tramp)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
