The documentary, directed by Lutz Becker, attempts to remain as objective as possible, serving as a neutral observer of the years 1918 through 1933 in Germany. Via newsreel footage and clips of features from the era, the film offers a kaleidoscopic view of the many elements that fueled the rise of the Socialist Nationalist Party, including post-WWI poverty. Hitler occupies a central place in the documentary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ibjz10QwFlg2i4ySmVUTxjSjo7c.jpg", "actors": ["Adolf Hitler (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
