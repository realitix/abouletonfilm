The Zurich Alice is a flautist who plays for the passersby like many another street or Metro musician. While so engaged, she meets a VIP Russian flautist who has defected and is living in the city. He falls in love with her and as a gesture of his devotion decides to arrange her solo concert debut. Meanwhile, Alice easily figures out what his plans are and devises her own secret scheme. When the day of the performance arrives, her Russian heartthrob is in for a flattering surprise, sure to end his bachelor status. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, Rovi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gXuktKzYF51WjoCXETHiclEKapM.jpg", "actors": ["Anne-Marie Blanc (Alice)", "Michael Gempart (Beamter)", "Towje Kleiner ()", "Johannes Silberschneider ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
