It prompted a public debate over conditions in remand prisons and Armley in particular, where overcrowding had reached such a level that prison officers refused to admit any new inmates. Simon faced a burglary charge over the theft of a hot-water bottle from an unoccupied flat. Less a hardened criminal than an immature, gawky teenager who never fitted in, Simon's tragic death inspired writer Vincent O'Connell and director  Corin Campbell-Hill to tell his story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aSvhvsNPX6C9uTcOHEkfNo6xz9O.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Popplewell (Simon)", "Leanne Whalley (Annie)", "Cheryl Godber (Marie)", "Nicky Evans (Toddy)", "Jensen Marriott (Gaz)", "June Watson (Brenda)", "Lynda Rooke (Stacy)", "Richard Mayes (Tom)", "Ray Ashcroft (DC Harris)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
