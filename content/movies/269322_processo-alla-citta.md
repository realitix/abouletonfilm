Salvatore Ruotolo and his wife are murdered and their bodies are found in different locations. Since the evidence points to a crime by the Neapolitan crime organization, the Camorra, fear and corruption cause serious hindrances to the investigation by police authorities. In charge is a young and courageous judge who, using evidence discovered by chance, tries to reconstruct the story of the double murder. The plot that the judge must unravel is very complicated. Many people are questioned, even those apparently above suspicion. Deciding to get to the bottom of the matter, the judge keeps all the suspects under arrest, causing a backlash of public opinion. But in the face of passive resistance which he finds everywhere, even from his own colleagues and family, he begins to feel discouraged and is about to give up the investigation when a new piece of evidence comes to light.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nceyU47ZwvHj8hLyK8FfmpS7T2b.jpg", "actors": ["Amedeo Nazzari (Prosecutor Antonio Spicacci)", "Silvana Pampanini (Liliana Ferrara)", "Paolo Stoppa ()", "Dante Maggio (Armando)", "Ir\u00e8ne Galter (Nunziata)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
