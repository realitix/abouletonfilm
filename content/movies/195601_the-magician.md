The magician enters from the wings, and making a bow to the audience, removes his coat and hat and they disappear mysteriously in the air. He then takes a white handkerchief from his pocket, holds it over his knees, and his long trousers disappear, and behold! he is clad in knickerbockers. He next makes a pass with a magic wand and a table suddenly appears before the audience, on which is a large pile of tissue paper. The magician takes up the paper and shakes it a few times and three live geese fly out upon the floor. This is a highly pleasing and mystifying subject.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d6hmbZdgPP1gQSXA0efBw33l8z.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
