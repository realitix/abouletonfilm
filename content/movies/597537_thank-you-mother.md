'Thank You Mother' is narrated by award winning Australian film maker and life long simplist Albert Falzon, who made the seminal 1970 surf film 'Morning of the Earth'.  'Thank You Mother' began as a story about the act of creating a surfboard and the art of riding one. Exploring the connection between surfer Torren Martyn and his friend, mentor and surfboard shaper Simon Jones of 'Morning of the Earth Surfboards'. This naturally led to the doorstep of another friend and mentor, Albert Falzon and the film became more about connection, creativity and friendship, about surfing, being happy, and living simply.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u7G69g753ePtUm4sbE34ZrvBOrR.jpg", "actors": ["Torren Martyn (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
