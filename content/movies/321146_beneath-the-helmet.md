At the age of 18, away from their houses, family, and friends these young individuals undergo a demanding journey, revealing the core of who they are and who they want to be. From the creators of the PBS-featured documentary film Israel Inside: How a Small Nation Makes a Big Difference, the film Beneath the Helmet illustrates how these young men and women are protecting not only their homes, but the shared values of peace, equality, opportunity, democracy, religious tolerance and women's rights. The lessons they learn along the way, are lessons that can be adapted, understood and appreciated by everyone.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ckENjdf7FdlAtoNlilqN4ifVI0D.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
