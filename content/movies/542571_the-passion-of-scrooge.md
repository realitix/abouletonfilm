About a composer\u2019s life? An opera within an opera? The Passion of Scrooge blurs these lines between performance, documentary, and fiction, into a cinematic concert experience that\u2019s seasoned with magical reality. Composer Jon Deak has adapted Charles Dickens\u2019 timeless tale into a contemporary opera that melts the heart, but doesn\u2019t avoid the darkness in Scrooge that\u2019s still resonant with the material concerns of our time. Using neither period costumes, nor set pieces to reconstruct old England, the film invites you to experience A Christmas Carol with the imaginative possibilities of a radio play. And then, to meet those visions in your head, filmmaker H. Paul Moon\u2018s floating camera intimately captures musicians performing the score as characters themselves, in this ageless haunted redemption story about \u201cus, every one.\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o3q2sLS6WLJ2YAMrMlUXYhdDYe2.jpg", "actors": ["William Sharp (Baritone)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "gFJwMemBKWU"}
