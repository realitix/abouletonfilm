The kids at this Compton school are about to experience more than a culture clash, as they embark on a rich journey and discover the educational and social value of theater. OT: Our Town tells the story of human spirit and its strength against the stereotypes holding them down. Where Thorton Wilder wrote about about little Grover's Corners, this documentary exemplifies how Our Town is every town. Our Town is Compton.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eyq85CYdzy4iGdIqabd3d3CtTpU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
