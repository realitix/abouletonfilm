Oppresive fog covers both dramas, as a reminder of how values such as courage, love and truth are fading.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qhWGNplB6gbfrzNwLYNKe3UPG0.jpg", "actors": ["Belinda Lee (Anna)", "Enrico Maria Salerno (Pino Barilari)", "Gabriele Ferzetti (Mario Villani)", "Gino Cervi (Carlo Aretusi)", "Raffaella Carr\u00e0 (Ines)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
