K. Lohithadas, directed by Sibi Malayil, and produced by Mohanlal under the banner of Pranavam Arts. It stars Mohanlal, Urvashi, Nedumudi Venu, Lakshmi, and Murali in the main roles. The film is especially known for its music that is largely Carnatic Classical and Semi Classical. The songs were composed by M. Raveendran.  Bharatham is interpreted as a modern day adaptation of the Ramayana from Bharath's perspective. How, in the absence of his elder brother, Bharath takes the responsibility of the family and hides his griefs is the core of the story. It won three National Film Awards that year; for Best Actor (Mohanlal), in the category of Special Jury for Raveendran's music, and Best Male Singer (K. J. Yesudas) for the song \"Rama Katha Ganalayam\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9IHpfkp5u3hs01WhKIApMnVAVDd.jpg", "actors": ["Mohanlal (Gopinathan)", "Nedumudi Venu (Ramanathan)", "Urvashi (Devi)", "Lakshmi (Ramani)", "Kaviyoor Ponnamma (Devaki)", "Thikkurissy Sukumaran Nair (Muthassan)", "Oduvil Unnikrishnan (Unnimama)", "KPAC Lalitha (Madhavi)", "Vineeth Kumar (Appu)", "Suchitra (Radha)", "Murali (HariKumar)", "Kunchan (Kuttan)", "Bobby Kottarakkara (Kunjunni)", "Paravoor Bharathan ()", "Lalu Alex ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [249210, 290890, 306469, 195380], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
