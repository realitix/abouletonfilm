The three parts of the oratorio are devoted respectively to the elements, animals and man, and an earthly paradise. The soloist personifies the Archangels Gabriel, Uriel and Raphael in the first two parts, and Adam and Eve in the third.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
