Burnt turkey, charred Christmas pudding, the same old things on television, and nothing but a book lent to him by Mickey Pierce: 'Body Language: The Lost Art.' When Grandad puts on his glad rags and heads to the OAPs' party at the community centre, the Trotter boys head to The Monte Carlo Club. Rodney puts his new-found knowledge of the unspoken language of love to use, but Del Boy has other ideas. As the brothers argue over who's technique is best, the objects of their affections are whisked away from under their noses.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8vEfiPL0niIGPU3tPQJ6F98KlJE.jpg", "actors": ["David Jason (Derek 'Del Boy' Trotter)", "Nicholas Lyndhurst (Rodney Trotter)", "Lennard Pearce (Granddad)", "Desmond McNamara (Earl)", "Nora Connolly (Anita)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
