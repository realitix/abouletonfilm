Besides Brazil, scenes were recorded involving clerics in various countries such as the United States, the Netherlands, Spain, France, Belgium, England, Costa Rica, Mexico, Germany, the Philippines, Italy or even the Vatican. This work reveals the practice behind the hypocrite hate speech against homosexuals and mainly the severe damage that it causes in families around the world, especially among the younger part of the population.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2JQyUdXCwpo7B4lseSUQYe2YExQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
