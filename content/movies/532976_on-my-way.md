Told as a series of texts between two friends dreading their plan to hang out, \u201cOn My Way\u201d directed by Mary Dauterman is a 90 second comedy about not wanting to leave the house. We watch in split screen as the two young women \u2014 one snacking and watching TV; the other, lounging comfortably in bed \u2014 prep for their supposed night out, \u201cwhat should I wear?\u201d \u201cidk something cute\u201d. Perfectly capturing the low-key lies and excuses we employ to avoid our friends, the social maneuvering and indecisiveness on display is a telling time capsule of millennial relationships and a hilarious bit of self-deprecation.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
