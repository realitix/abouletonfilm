I have been very tough on most of Decoteau's films after _Brotherhood III_. After that film, most of his films did not satisfy the majority of the DVD, VOD audience it was intended for. _My Stepbrother Is A Vampire!?!_ was a pleasant surprise. The casting was very interesting. I hadn't seen William McNamara (_Doing Time on Maple Drive, Copycat, Stag_) in ages and found his performance good. Judson Birza did a great job in one of his earliest roles. They had a real sassy cat who is voiced by Dee Wallace (_E.T. Cujo_). For the adult, the film is almost high camp - there isn't anything objectionable. It could amuse most tweens and _Twilight_ fans."}], "recommandations_id": []}
