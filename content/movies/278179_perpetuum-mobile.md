He spends his days at the club of his childhood friend, Adi, where he plays cards for money. It is springtime. He meets Dina, an old friend of Adi. They quickly become close, start playing as a team, and move in together. One evening, Ron loses all his money at the tables, gets drunk and is thrown out by Adi\u2019s bodyguards. Dina takes advantage of the turmoil to steal from Adi. She convinces Ron to skip town. The two hide out in a fishing village. It is autumn. Ron and Dina discover that they know nothing about each another. They are strangers who can\u2019t so much as look into each other\u2019s eyes much less tell each other the truth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4Ece7fktMW1VyiKhp96aXsXQzaA.jpg", "actors": ["Viktorija Kuodyt\u0117 ()", "Donatas \u0160imukauskas ()", "Julija Goyd (Dina)", "Dainius Gavenonis (Ron)", "Jonas Vaitkus ()", "Ram\u016bnas Cic\u0117nas (Adi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "I3Zvg3m_z8E"}
