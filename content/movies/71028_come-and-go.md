Beckett's note to the text is almost twice as long. Three women meet in a softly lit place. Seated on a bench facing the audience, they reminisce about old school days. Each woman leaves the stage briefly, and during each absence an appalling secret is whispered about the third \u2013 which the audience doesn't hear. At the end the three hold hands with the cryptic comment 'I can feel the rings', though Beckett specifies that none are apparent.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fL7N1dPupwG1yFD2oSyx4rZ1VYY.jpg", "actors": ["Anna Massey (Vi)", "Si\u00e2n Phillips (Ru)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
