Starring his six main characters, from Bubba Jay, a Nascar-obsessed hick, to Peanut, a flamboyant gay monkey, Dunham\u2019s puppets have dirty but relatively inoffensive senses of humor that mock the American Dream. His skills as a ventriloquist alone make him a fascinating entertainer, and anyone interested in how puppetry and ventriloquism has progressed over the decades would benefit from watching Dunham bring life to his wooden friends.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mTz9I6PB6Bp8ji7KhKnwgj3jhSd.jpg", "actors": ["Jeff Dunham (Himself / Walter / Sweet Daddy Dee / Bubba J / Peanut / Jos\u00e9 Jalape\u00f1o on a Stick)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [14540, 75190, 14541, 137144], "youtube_key": "LXDMuKZzd6o"}
