I was attracted to these authors \u2014 their life of poetry, politics and sexual invention\u2014and inspired by my previous fictionalizing of home movies in Covert Action and The Future is Behind You. I worked with non-actors, the seasons and the extraordinary architecture and landscapes of Italy where the Shelleys were in exile for six of their eight years together.\r The result was a feature film A Shape of Error, gorgeous, emotional and harnessed to the narrative. I wanted to go further and abetted by digital technology, I have \u2018exploded\u2019 the film. The result is UNBOUND, digressive, looped, unpredictable, symphonic, spontaneous, messy\u2014like life and memory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xhOLXiuaNXH60oEeaxKy17h7KKK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
