Conrad Veidt stars as sinister Egyptian Mahmoud Baroundi, who even before the film gets under way has left a long trail of ruined women behind him. His latest victim is American girl Mona Chepstow (Mary Ellis), whom Baroundi treats like dirt and makes her like it. The plot centers around a murder by poison, as evidenced by the film's deliberately exotic title. Critics in 1934 praised newcomer Mary Ellis for underplaying her role, but many film fans preferred Nazimova's arm-waving histrionics in the earlier version.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lLmnBgr46z9JJi1tanbN2eEdFsy.jpg", "actors": ["Mary Ellis ()", "John Stuart ()", "Cedric Hardwicke ()", "Conrad Veidt ()", "Jeanne Stuart ()", "Rodney Millington ()", "Eve South ()", "Michael Shepley ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
