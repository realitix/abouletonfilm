It's a place of magic and the place where Des Bishop chose to film his latest, internationally acclaimed stand up show Desfunctional. Take a seat and prepare yourself for a hilariously funny, electrifying and unique comedy experience.  From skinny dipping in Dingle to what the Irish Barack Obama would sound like, Desfunctional takes a humorous look at why the Irish turn every emotional experience into a joke.  Des is on fire in this brilliant show which delivers the powerful and intimate feel of a sizzling trad music session.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9zNdLamdnCBFblipnaRTsvbhFyj.jpg", "actors": ["Des Bishop (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
