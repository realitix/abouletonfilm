It follows the Saxon protagonist, Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe, who is out of favor with his father for his allegiance to the Norman king Richard the Lionheart. The story is set in 1194, after the failure of the Third Crusade, when many of the Crusaders were still returning to their homes in Europe. King Richard, who had been captured by Leopold of Austria on his return journey to England, was believed to still be in captivity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/PQ1aWRo9AImFWuzwenokN0gHws.jpg", "actors": ["Tamara Akulova (Lady Rowena)", "Leonid Kulagin (Cedric the Saxon)", "Boris Khmelnitsky (Robin Hood)", "Romualds Anc\u0101ns (Richard the Lion-Hearted)", "Vytautas Tomkus (Baron Reginald)", "Algimantas Masiulis (Prince John)", "Aleksandr Filippenko (Wamba)", "Vladimir Talashko (Messenger)", "Yuri Smirnov (Father Took)", "P\u0113teris Gaudi\u0146\u0161 (Ivanko)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
