She pauses to think about the family she will leave behind: a completely helpless husband, a kind son who cares about nothing except his mother, and a daughter too busy to attend to anything but her own affairs. Soon-ok begins to prepare a gift for her family -- the opportunity to bring them together for a final farewell. Once fractured and separated, the family comes to learn that death does not have to be the antithesis of life, but can be its affirmation and awakening.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qBlsukahGMIe0HsmJOkdSwaxyNJ.jpg", "actors": ["Lee Kyung-young (Father)", "Kim Young-ok ()", "Jung Eun-chae (Ji-yoon)", "Im Ji-gyu (Young-jae)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
