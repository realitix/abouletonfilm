At the final news conference, Cotto warned Antonio Margarito, \"I'm going to slap you like a little girl.\"  I'm pretty sure Cotto hits harder than most little girls, and Margarito would probably agree. Cotto dominated for most of the match, and eventually won on a technical knockout in nine rounds.  As with all boxing matches, there are plenty of things to be learned about each fighter. As a result, I have compiled a list of four things we learned from Saturday night. Feel free to let me know what you think about the list, or the fight itself", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/klHtpFoxpiieCPdUwz7HCtwNwGe.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
