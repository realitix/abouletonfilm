Hunted criminals, the two young lovers take flight to Yamato, but, as in Chikamatsu's other domestic tragedies of love and duty (known as sewamono), they must be pursued and their passion destroyed by death. Favourite Uchida themes, such as the indenturing of a prostitute (cf. YOSHIWARA; A BLOODY SPEAR AT MT. FUJI), and his characteristic emphasis on performance and theatrical artifice re-emerge here; but the daring device of having Chikamatsu appear as a character - not unlike having Shakespeare interpolated into a film adaptation of one of his plays - is just one of many surprises this remarkable film holds. \u201cExtraordinary\u201d (Donald Richie).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3VlPgToPv19qGIF3ZLtxWvMiDdf.jpg", "actors": ["Kinnosuke Nakamura (Chubei Kameya)", "Ineko Arima (Umegawa)", "Kinuyo Tanaka (Myokan)", "Keiko Yukishiro ()", "Hiromi Hanazono (Otoku)", "Chie Ueki (Otama)", "Sumiko Hidaka ()", "Chieko Naniwa (Oen)", "Koday\u00fb Ichikawa ()", "Ry\u00f4suke Kagawa ()", "Koji Arima ()", "Yoshiko Nakamura (Okiyo)", "Yoshiko Yashioji ()", "Minoru Shiraki ()", "Tokinosuke Nakamura ()", "Masao Oda ()", "Eitar\u00f4 Shind\u00f4 ()", "Minoru Chiaki ()", "Eijir\u014d T\u014dno ()", "Harue Akagi ((uncredited))", "Chiez\u00f4 Kataoka (Monzaemon Chikamatsu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
