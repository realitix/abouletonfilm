Junko is nearly 30, nearing the traditional \u2018best before\u2019 of the Japanese society, and feels increasing pressure: without a partner candidate or even a particular wish to have children anytime soon, she decides to become an egg donor. And not just for the free Hawaii trip that would be the prize if her candidacy is successful. At a counseling session, she meets her niece Aki who has similar plans.
