Ernie Anderson, who played Cleveland's counter-culture media celebrity Ghoulardi, hosted WJW-TV's late-night horror movies from 1963 to 1966 and was an incredible influence locally. The one-hour production premiered on Western Reserve PBS in 2009. It earned two Emmy Awards, for directing and editing for producer Phil Hoffman. Turn Blue is the work of award-winning producer/director Phil Hoffman, Ed.D., who also teaches radio and television courses at The University of Akron. It is the latest in a series of local history productions that Hoffman has created in cooperation with Western Reserve Public Media. The program has also aired on WGTE Public Media in Northeast Ohio.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aJfvCKKQC6KV1PtMmK2T3nuHMbB.jpg", "actors": ["Ernie Anderson (Ghoulardi, Himself)", "Chuck Schodowski (Himself)", "Rich Heldenfels (Himself)", "Tom Feran (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
