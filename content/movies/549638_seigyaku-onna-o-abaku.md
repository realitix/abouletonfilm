Kishi (Taguchi from the Tetsuo films) is a timid salaryman, married with one neglected daughter. His one-time classmate Daimon (Haku Ryu, looking more like Christopher Walken than ever) singles him out for what seems to be an experiment in psycho-sexual damage. Daimon transforms Kishi's life by offering kinky sexual encounters with his own girlfriend - but then wants disturbing reciprocal favours. Backed by a great John Zorn score, Hiroki's ultra-sheer visual style turns Tokyo into an elegant fantasy city, bursting with perversity and paranoia. Just the thing to erase unhappy memories of Polanski's Bitter Moon.\r - timeout", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kByvl5esrH0OoMkq0Q9DuDaL30B.jpg", "actors": ["Yuka Asagiri ()", "Y\u00f4ko Azusa ()", "Yu Tachibana ()", "Ren Osugi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
