When he gets there he discovers that his daughter, a lawyer, is under great stress because of her biggest client, an old geezer who is the wealthiest and most powerful man in town. The girl's father decides to make the old man \"disappear\" by performing a rain dance he learned from an Indian chief back in Wyoming--and lo and behold it starts to rain and the old man does indeed disappear. The local sheriff, however, suspects foul play and arrests the girl's father.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2yHoPQSDTlv18clp3YJoJrD9TIi.jpg", "actors": ["Clem Bevans (Sam 'Bigmouth' Smedley)", "Cecil Kellaway (Jonathan Huntoon Smith)", "David Bruce (Tom Adams, Smith's Attorney)", "Virginia Grey (Janet Smedley Adams)", "Robert Board (Steve Terhune (as Bob Board))", "Leslie Banning (Debbie Smith, Jonathan's Daughter (as Leslye Banning))", "Syd Saylor (Sheriff Luke Arundle)", "Frank Lackteen (Broken Head (as Running Deer in Credits))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
