There's Albert who's pretty much angry at everybody. His brother Dominic who thinks it's better to be jobless than to work an underpaid job, his patient sister Joan who works at a sari shop, his independent girlfriend Stella who feels under-appreciated by her boyfriend, his father and his colleagues, client and Stella's family. The film is very much a social commentary about Middle-class life in Bombay during the late \u201970s and the conflicts arising in the labour force because workers were getting severely underpaid.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2FbacsRzCUXNNU1tRNkNZPJncln.jpg", "actors": ["Naseeruddin Shah (Albert Pinto)", "Shabana Azmi (Stella)", "Smita Patil (Joan Pinto)", "Dilip Dhawan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
