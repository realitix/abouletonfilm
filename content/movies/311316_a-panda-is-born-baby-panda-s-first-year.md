In the first film, scientists investigate the low birthrate among pandas and use their findings to help Mei Xiang and Tian Tian produce a baby. Then, watch cuddly cub Tai Shan grow and explore the zoo habitat, from wobbly first steps to climbing trees.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zPOgrVLwWPWpSUgcZEmAURzCWhT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
