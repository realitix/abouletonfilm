We would, no kidding, watch this once or twice a week for a few years. It was our cult favorite. I found a copy on eBay a few years ago (I think from the folks that produced it). I see it's on Amazon these days.\r\n\r\nThe movie, it's pure teenage bubblegum. Pondo Sinatra is looking to get pussy. The movie is all about how he tries and fails repeatedly. It takes on a Benny Hill-like feel for a while as he goings about his trial and MOSTLY error. But then he has a breakthrough in the chemistry lab and discovers a compound that brings the women on in drives; and there's no way to turn it off. Midas touch. \r\n\r\nThis was really funny when I was 15. I find it funny today. I haven't grown up much. If you can find a copy, give it a look. The Untouchables performance of \"The General\" stands out. See review on Amazon, they pretty much mirror this: Nostalgia, boobies, fun..."}], "recommandations_id": [16405, 241432, 40798, 121822]}
