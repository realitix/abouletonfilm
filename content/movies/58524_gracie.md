When World War Two breaks out, Gracie sings for the troops despite poor health, to the dismay of her fussy husband, film director Monty Banks, an Italian, born Mario Bianchi. With Italy's entry into the war Monty is in danger of being interned so Gracie consents to his moving to America whilst she tours Canada, fund-raising for the war effort. She is accused of deserting the country which made her famous and booed offstage, though she later tours battlefields as a singer. With the war over she regains popularity, performing 'Take Me To Your Heart Again' at the London Palladium. Banks dies in 1950 and, though still a successful singer, Gracie never regains her pre-war iconic status.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1rBSSKLpiJYKGucCVdtPu3wX0ty.jpg", "actors": ["Jane Horrocks (Gracie Fields)", "Tom Hollander (Monty Banks)", "Ellie Haddington (Jenny Stansfield)", "Tony Haygarth (Fred Stansfield)", "Ruth Kearney (Miriam)", "David Dawson (Harry Parr Davies)", "Alistair Petrie (Basil Dean)", "Ed Coleman (Soldier/Journalist)", "Nigel Whitmey (Reporter 2)", "Nathan Nolan (Reporter 1)", "Philip Desmeules (Reporter 3)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
