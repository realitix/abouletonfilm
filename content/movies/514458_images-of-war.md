The clips are taken from television documentaries from Arte to CNN. The images show aestheticized fireworks from Dresden to Bagdad, where people only appear as shadows. The sound is also a collage with Liszt's 'Prelude' as the pathetic announcement of the nazi news to the fanfare of the CNN. Only in the last sequences death becomes real. The images of operational missions comes from amateur videos of the American soldiers who have posted them on the net, accompanied by rock music.\" - Birgit Hein.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
