From the ridiculous to the sublime, her astonishing but often controversial magazine covers have not only broken the rules but also set the high bar for fashion, art and commerce over the past 25 years. From the legendary \u201cBlack Issue\" and the \u201cPlastic Surgery issue\" Sozzani remains deeply committed to exploring subject matter off limits to most in order to shake up the status quo and occasionally redefine the concept of beauty.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fFs5bH3M6SEJbyPvZyVuWQ3OU4r.jpg", "actors": ["Baz Luhrmann ()", "Courtney Love ()", "Naomi Campbell ()", "Donatella Versace ()", "Karl Lagerfeld ()", "Valentino Garavani ()", "Marina Abramovi\u0107 ()", "Jeff Koons ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [450941, 289561, 391754, 451329], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
