Ileana Cotrubas is poignant and touching as Violetta, the consumptive courtesan who finds true love with Alfredo, sung with style and passion by the great Pl\u00e1cido Domingo. Cornell MacNeil is Germont, Alfredo\u2019s father, who forces the two apart, setting in motion events that lead to a shattering and tragic conclusion.
