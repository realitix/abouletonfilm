Based on the novel of the same name by Paula Gosling, the story had previously been filmed as Cobra (1986) starring Sylvester Stallone. For all intents and purposes, Fair Game is a decent action movie, although overindulgent in most aspects (huge explosions, gratuitous boob shots of Cindy Crawford, nudity, a famous sex scene and one-note acting). The film was designed solely as a vehicle to capitalize on the enormous popularity of Cindy Crawford, the hottest Supermodel of the 1990's... and in that respect, it had enormous success. Fair Game has become a sort of Cult classic, based on the adoration for Crawford's sex appeal and a brief, early role by Salma Hayek. As far as her bad acting goes, Cindy Crawford said it best, taking the high road with \"Oh well, at least I tried.\" Indeed, she deserves an \"A\" for effort."}], "recommandations_id": [18550, 17770, 9625, 867], "youtube_key": "YC3npzqwXcs"}
