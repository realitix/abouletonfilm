Dawn starts then to draw silhouettes of dunes while motionless figures punctuate landscape. From night\u00b4s abstraction, light returns its dimension to space and their volume to bodies.

And now the bodies are those which dissolves into the desert.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v4UVsi9fXD5xmnuaYVjgiMVq0wi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
