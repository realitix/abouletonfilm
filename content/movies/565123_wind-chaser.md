He and his mother Dakunta (Wanda Hamidah) want him to go to university, but his father \u2013 the leader of a gang of bandits \u2013 refuses to allow it. Dapunta decides to go to university no matter what.  His crush Nyimas (Siti Helda) and teacher Damar (Lukman Sardi) help him, motivating him to practice his running so that he can use athletics to enter the university of his choice. However, his classmate Yusuf (Giorgino Abraham) \u2013 who has similar running abilities \u2013 is also training; he sabotages some of Dapunta's practice sessions. Meanwhile, the headmaster attempts to limit Dapunta's training out of spite for his father.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4BFUk86gKkna2wUF7tVYlwlfCOA.jpg", "actors": ["Mathias Muchus (Ayah Dapunta)", "Agus Kuncoro (Ferdy)", "Lukman Sardi (Pak Damar)", "Giorgino Abraham (Yusuf)", "Siti Helda Meilita (Nyimas)", "Qausar Harta Yudana (Dapunta)", "Wanda Hamidah (Bunda Dapunta)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
