She seeks the answers to some big questions. How did he become a one-man ruler of Rome? How did he use spin and PR on his way to the top? Why was he killed? And she asks some equally intriguing little questions. How did he conceal his bald patch? Did he really die, as William Shakespeare put it, with the words Et tu, Brute on his lips? Above all, Mary explores his surprising legacy right up to the present day. Like it or not, Caesar is still present in our everyday lives, our language, and our politics. Many dictators since, not to mention some other less autocratic leaders, have learned the tricks of their trade from Julius Caesar.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qScDXXJOYFyexkM9Xh6ju2LEqNT.jpg", "actors": ["Mary Beard (Presenter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
