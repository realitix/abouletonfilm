The uncle's will instructs Danny to find the rest of the statue, so Danny, who speaks no Russian, embarks on a trip that takes him (and the Golem's hand) to Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Siberia, fumbling with hotel clerks, taxi drivers, and bureaucrats, following leads, and making discoveries about myth, story telling, art, and hope.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/czKy1E4y0dmqnd9Hs2vPp77uad3.jpg", "actors": ["Jerome Koenig (Daniel Cornish)", "Hanna Schygulla (Michelle)", "Samuel Fuller (Sam)", "Masha Itkina (Macha)", "Natalia Voitulevitch-Manor ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
