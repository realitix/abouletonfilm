As a consequence of that, he takes a job working the counter of a low-cost, somewhat hip eatery, and meets a French girl with whom he has a brief affair. Though the affair ends, it has created an obsession in him - first with the French girl, and later with slim young women in general. All of them reject him, and he leaves his waiting job to prowl around for these inaccessible beauties. Meanwhile, his wife is having their baby.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/orPrs1gOXi0Xp92m2ETHHV60eec.jpg", "actors": ["Christopher Berger ()", "Tom Bishop ()", "Sam Bress ()", "Darroch Greer ()", "Audrey Matson ()", "Eric Mitchell (Joe Belinksy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
