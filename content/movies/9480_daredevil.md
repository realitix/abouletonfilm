It's that it takes a great character and turns him into a mishmash of tired clich\u00e9s, shamelessly copying The Crow, Spider-Man, The Matrix, as well as both Burton and Schumacher's Batman in an attempt to appeal to the teen angst crowd. Don't blame Ben Affleck. He does what he can but the script and terrible production design lets him down as much as it us."}], "recommandations_id": [9947, 1927, 1250, 8698], "youtube_key": "LmP3YFk_YHA"}
