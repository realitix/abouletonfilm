The story endeavors to invite comparisons between the high-toned romantic adventures of wealthy Gloria Endicott (Erin O'Brien-Moore) and more earthy amours of low-born Kay Duncan (Ann Doran). Caught between both ladies is confused hero Ross Graham (Donald Cook). In her first major feature-film role, Ann Doran was drubbed by the critics, but she survived to become one of Hollywood's busiest character actresses (best remembered as James Dean's mother in Rebel Without a Cause).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bu6YfxMYmyAlkgyuShkXawaGJYZ.jpg", "actors": ["Donald Cook (Ross Graham)", "Erin O'Brien-Moore (Gloria Endicott)", "Ann Doran (Kay Duncan)", "Alan Edwards (Pete Mattland)", "Douglas Fowley (Ted Curlew)", "John Qualen (Bill Harvey)", "Barbara Bedford (Carol Anderson)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
