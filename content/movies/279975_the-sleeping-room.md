When 19 year-old Brighton call-girl Blue meets her latest punter Bill, little does she know the horrifying impact it will have on her wayward life. For the seaside house he\u2019s renovating once used to be an infamous Victorian brothel with a murderous history. Together they uncover a mysterious annexe behind a two-way-mirror that prostitutes of the day used as a clandestine resting area known as a Sleeping Room. Further investigation exposes the habits of a cruel serial killer who recorded his most unspeakable crimes on the media of the era, the Mutoscope, the end-of-the-pier coin-in-the-slot peep show machines, and a connection to Blue herself. Now the chilling closet space is about to unleash terrible occult forces and nobody will escape its monstrous power unless a score for a heinous felony is settled.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xocpWVOsxKcv2OajUg6oH2NviHv.jpg", "actors": ["Leila Mimmack (Blue)", "Joseph Beattie (Bill)", "Julie Graham (Cynthia)", "Christopher Adamson (Fiskin)", "Chris Waller (Glenny)", "David Sibley (Freddie)", "Lucy Clements (Helena)", "Mike Altmann (Jim Whipps)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [47540, 82680, 120409, 80298], "youtube_key": "mhlBHWwx9hQ"}
