Minerva's Lilies centres on two sisters, Leah and Nayomi aged, 9 and 10 as they go through the motions of 'being girls'. The visual meditation forms the experience of not only the girls' little world of magic but that of the viewer and their mother who is carefully perched around their dreamlike atmosphere.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/etbp04mSXuMeiEEjYBgv7zRti08.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
