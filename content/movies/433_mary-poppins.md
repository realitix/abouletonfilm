Their parents are distant from the children and each nanny they employ leaves in exasperation after the chaos the children cause.\r\n\r\nThe children's father is a banker who is cold towards them and their mother is too busy with the suffragette movement.They want the perfect nanny and in a sudden gust of wind, Mary Poppins drops by. She possesses magical powers such as a bottomless handbag. Mary Poppins changes the life of the children and also meets up with her friend Bert, the one man band.\r\n\r\nMary Poppins combines live action with Disney animation as well as some memorable songs and in Dick Van Dyke an unforgettable cockney accent.\r\n\r\nThe movie is regarded as a Disney classic but I found the animation to be below average, the film overlong  and not all that amusing."}], "recommandations_id": [10693, 10882, 11360, 10895]}
