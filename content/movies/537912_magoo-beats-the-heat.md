Thinking himself to be at the beach, he tries fishing (he hooks a turtle which he mistakes for a crab) and swimming. Meanwhile, a desert wanderer and his horse are lost beyond hope when suddenly they lay eyes on Magoo's set up. Thinking the whole thing to be a mirage, they decide to make the best of it by devouring Magoo's picnic lunch and refreshments despite Magoo's protests. After the hearty meal, the man wants to thank Magoo before he \"fades away\" by giving him the only gold nugget he found while trekking the desert. Magoo thinks the gold is a sea-shell and plans to give it to Waldo to add to his collection!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jim Backus (Mr. Magoo(voice))", "Earl Bennett (Prospector(voice))", "Jerry Hausner (Waldo(voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
