Peter Malberg is the somewhat goofy - but very much in love author Peter Str\u00f8m. He has fallen for the publisher's daughter, Else Fischer (played by one of the 30s biggest divas, Gull-Maj Norin). The same has just happened to the bright journalist Fritz Faber, who also intends to fight for the young Else.
