He is friendly with Sheela, who works as a maidservant, hopes to marry her someday, much to the chagrin of Kalu Dada, who lusts after Sheela. One night while returning home he comes across an abandoned male baby near Bhagwan Shri Ganesh's Mandir. He looks for the family of this child, asks for help from the Mandir's Poojary, as well as a Mullah and a Hawaldar, all in vain. When he tries to abandon the child, he is literally forced to adopt him, and when he does so, he faces considerable opposition from his neighbors, and ends up hating the child.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zT6RV2b6rNsgWqhCpiRnkwH2wd5.jpg", "actors": ["Mehmood (Mahesh)", "Bharathi Rao (Radha)", "Bhushan Tiwari (Kalu Dada)", "Amitabh Bachchan (Augustine)", "Dharmendra (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
