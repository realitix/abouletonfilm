By the early eighties the class had become the \u2018Godzilla\u2019 of the rally scene and what resulted were the most awesome cars ever seen on the rally stages of the world - 600 horsepower, 4WD, turbocharged monsters that could cover forest, tarmac or gravel stages faster than anything ever seen before or since.  In 1986 the door was slammed shut on the F1 cars of mountain and forest roads. Faster and faster cars combined with wilder and crazier crowds meant that within the confines of rally car competition the group B rocket ships were just \u201ctoo fast to race\u201d.  The legacy of Group B, however, is a whole range of spectacular cars that continue to thrill enthusiasts.  Includes awesome action footage and stunning close ups.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zuUMnksGflpYjXbMZikGjs6yrxA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "wBXieuH_Fjc"}
