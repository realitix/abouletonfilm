Now he needs something to eat for breakfast. The hungry spider is hoping to make his breakfast from the various visitors in his web, but oh, boy, is he in for a big surprise! He traps a honeybee in his web; the irate bee threatens him with a sting and gets away. Next, he gets a British wasp. The wasp thinks that he wants to have breakfast and a spot of tea with him. No tea, no wasp. Next, a little moth... only the moth snares the spider in his own web and takes it home to his mother for breakfast...
