To be with him, she makes a deal with the evil sorceress: her beautiful voice against a life on land. It seems to work at first, the prince is enchanted with her lovely appearance. But the memory of a foreign princess still haunts him: The one who found him on the beach where the mermaid had left him, and whom he (of course) believes to be his saviour. To resolve this mistake is too much for the mute little mermaid, and not even her father, king of all seas, can help her in the impending catastrophe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/17hgbXzD4aiiAX3rkN7u7AeuysM.jpg", "actors": ["Miroslava \u0160afr\u00e1nkov\u00e1 (The Little Mermaid)", "Radovan Lukavsk\u00fd (King of all the seas)", "Petr Svojtka (Prince Jizn\u00ed r\u00edse)", "Libu\u0161e \u0160afr\u00e1nkov\u00e1 (Princess)", "Marie Ros\u016flkov\u00e1 (Grandmother)", "Milena Dvorsk\u00e1 (Witch)", "Jind\u0159ich Narenta (Counselor)", "Dagmar Patrasov\u00e1 ()", "Andrea Cunderl\u00edkov\u00e1 ()", "Jirina Krejc\u00edkov\u00e1 ()", "Jaroslava Schallerov\u00e1 ()", "Jana \u0160vandov\u00e1 ()", "Milan Hein ()", "Alexei Okunev ()", "Bert Schneider ()", "Ji\u0159\u00ed Ornest (Aide to the Prince)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [50774, 85628, 54333, 82279], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
