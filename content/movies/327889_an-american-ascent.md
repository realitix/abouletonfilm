As the United States transitions to a 'minority majority' nation, a staggering number of people of color do not identify with America's wild places. By embarking on the grueling multi-week climb of the 20,327ft Denali, nine African-American climbers set out to bridge this 'adventure gap' - challenging outdated notions of what adventure looks like by changing the face of America's biggest and baddest mountain on the 100th anniversary of its first summit.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8uyPOBRYQp6n6AgAslxvrAymP73.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
