Feil, a social worker whose career has focused on communicating with language-impaired patients, produced this film and dozens more with her husband Edward Feil. In the film, the patient\u2019s inner thoughts are heard through voice-over as she struggles in frustration to overcome her disability and to connect with her caregivers. The Council on International Non-theatrical Events (CINE) awarded \"Inner World\" its top honor, the Golden Eagle. More than 47 years later, the film is still being screened by media artists and independent filmmakers who appreciate its innovative artistic qualities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1qNf8ZUpfZGQLBNm038QqGXhead.jpg", "actors": ["Naomi Feil (Nurse)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
