His good looks have always worked to his benefit overshadowing the fact that he lives paycheck to paycheck struggling to make ends meet. After being notified that he has come into a lump sum of money years after his parents perished in the tragedy of 9/11, Reggie decides that it's best to keep his new multi-millionaire status under wraps. The only person who knows the truth about his bank account is Reggie's childhood friend Blake Montgomery.
