Super-scientist Larry Martin, inventor of the first stratospheric-flight spaceship as well as a jet-powered personal flying suit with helmet, is called upon by the government to investigate ramped-up UFO reports occasioned by the Martians' spaceships.  The Martians, meanwhile, led by Marex, engage a renegade earth scientist and a gaggle of gangsters to help them steal supplies, operate a menacing robot, and build their bomb.  This movie serial in 12 chapters was originally planned as a sequel to \"Radar Men From The Moon\" with Commando Cody as the hero but at the last moment the main characters' names were changed and all other references to that serial removed from the script.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wqcAFgqBtS8ggaPekLT6kdK7ybc.jpg", "actors": ["Judd Holdren (Larry Martin)", "Aline Towne (Sue Davis)", "Lane Bradford (Marex)", "Stanley Waxman (Dr. Harding)", "Wilson Wood (Bob Wilson)", "John Crawford (Roth)", "Ray Boyle (Shane)", "Leonard Nimoy (Narab)", "Craig Kelly (Mr. Henderson)", "Gayle Kellogg ()", "Robert Garabedian (Elah)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
