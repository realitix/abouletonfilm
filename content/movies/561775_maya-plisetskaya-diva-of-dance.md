She became prima ballerina in 1962, and after being excluded for political reasons many years from tours to the West, she was finally in 1959 allowed to join the American tour with the Bolshoi. She soon gained recognition as one of the world's foremost ballerinas, combining flawless technique with a sensitivity to emotional nuance and becoming the first to truly understand how to combine outstanding dance skills with dramatic expression. This documentary features footage of her greatest successes as a ballerina together with an interview in which Plisetskaya describes her life as a dancer, from Stalin to perestroika, giving an insight into the life of an artist in this extraordinary chapter of Russian history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zKv7MgAniM1Oa2jrsTXhFiLz2b4.jpg", "actors": ["Maya Plisetskaya ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
