As the lines of reality blur, she begins to question which world is real. The film is shot partially in 3D 180 degree view and partially in 2D. The format dynamically switches from 2D to 3D when the main character puts on her virtual reality goggles. This allows the viewer to see the virtual world through her eyes and creates a one of a kind cinematic experience.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wi1paRoZRLTqBlK7P9RbmGDYLlN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
