Whilst her empathetic but overworked caseworker tries to get her settled in new permanent accommodation, Emily is either in attack mode or being non-present. The promise of a new beginning should be alluring but the reality of isolation and loneliness, which the caseworker can do little about, are also apparent in this meditation on the complexities that face many long-term homeless people.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
