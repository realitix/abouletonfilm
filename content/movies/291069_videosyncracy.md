Videosyncracy follows three very different video rental stores as they negotiate their survival in three distinct Los Angeles neighborhoods: Old Bank DVD in the Downtown arts district, Vidiots in sunny seaside Santa Monica, and Eddie Brandt\u2019s Saturday Matinee in bustling North Hollywood. Their stories chronicle not only the birth and twilight of a particular kind of corner store, but also decades of personal lives intertwined with those of their communities, the new challenges and facilities of a rapidly changing world, and an enduring love of the movies, a slice of Americana on the brink of disappearance yet defiant to the end.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3F1gPG4e0nhmH9FYBirazlDObIp.jpg", "actors": ["Claire Brandt (Owner of Eddie Brandt's)", "Donovan Brandt (Owner of Eddie Brandt's)", "Erik Loysen (Owner of Old Bank DVD)", "Mark Schumacher (Owner of Old Bank DVD)", "Patty Polinger (Owner of Vidiots)", "Cathy Tauber (Owner of Vidiots)", "Bree Wakeland (Old Bank DVD Clerk)", "Sean Schlemmer (Vidiots Clerk)", "Ryan Marker (Vidiots Clerk)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "eaM92tEnO0o"}
