He then swims around with just a snorkel sticking out of the water. He emerges and submerges then sticks his upper body out of the sea and blows a jet of water out of his mouth. He swims along doing the front crawl. He looks very alarmed to see a whale swimming by him. His ears elongate. He screams and waves his arms in the air. Suddenly he is lifted out of the water by the whale - Jerry stands on his back.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gRkUe2YpfAFLBOs6QdmGn0AJUPn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
