A young man named Abdelwahed pins his dreams of a better life for himself and his family on travelling to France and finding work there. As the eldest of eight children, he becomes the principal caretaker and breadwinner for his family after his father passes away. He fills out forms and waits for his work permit to arrive. Meanwhile, Hlima, his recently widowed mother who\u2019s reticent to let him go, tries in vain to dissuade him and enlists the help of Abdelwahed\u2019s grandfather too. As the days flow by to the cadence of life in the countryside, marked by the hardships of farming, Abdelwahed waits. All he can do is wait. Straddling fiction and documentary, Alyam, Alyam is Ahmed El Maanouni\u2019s first narrative feature, and the first Moroccan film ever to be selected at the Cannes Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i69uJiFAyeq3QzbRizf29ceQwsY.jpg", "actors": ["Ben Brahim ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
