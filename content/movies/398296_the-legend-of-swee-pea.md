He was born in Brooklyn in 1967 and grew up in the poorest neighborhoods of Brooklyn and Queens. His mother died when he was three, and his father deserted the family, leaving Lloyd an orphan to be raised by his two grandmothers. Virtually unsupervised, Lloyd learned early-on how to hustle to survive. Hustling came easy for him because he was a charming and likable kid. He still hustles to this day.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a55VQ2DSEv08XE5wpZgKCqr2zd3.jpg", "actors": ["Lloyd Daniels (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "v4hNO8IMvyw"}
