This disc contains two, not one, two instructional videos on the art of break dancing made at the height of the breakin\u2019 craze, 1984. First up is the astonishing Breakin\u2019 with the Mighty Poppalots. The Poppalots were THE premier break dancing group in the early 80\u2019s, and this video will show you why! Learn such tricks as The Helicopter, Spider &amp; Crab, Female Walk (?!), The Bicycle, and of course there is a true crash course on the art of Miming. And let us not forget that all raps heard in this amazing video are written and performed by \u201cBone, the Crackmaster\u201d Chuck Jeffreys! Next up is Let\u2019s Break, another insightful Michael Jackson inspired break dance instructional video. By the time this disc is done you\u2019ll be breakin\u2019 like Turbo. Just remember to wear those knee &amp; elbow pads until you get your grove down to a science.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
