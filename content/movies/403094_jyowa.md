This project was started in Tokyo in 2011 as a documentary film, yet it ended up becoming more of an aesthetic experience that takes the viewer into the unique universe of five of Japan\u2019s top rope artists (by order of appearance): Naka Akira, Yukimura Haruki, Nawashi Kanna, Urado Hiroshi and Hajime Kinoko. In each of the the five chapters we can see two people taking a journey into a deep and profound level of communication in which rope takes a very special place.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fxJQILTwjfzj64orXAdns5b5kB7.jpg", "actors": ["Akira Nakata ()", "Nozomi Mashiro ()", "Haruki Yukimura ()", "Sanae ()", "Kanna Nawashi ()", "Kagura ()", "Kazuki Nakamura ()", "Kinoko Hajime ()", "Hana Jhenna ()", "Hiroshi Urado ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
