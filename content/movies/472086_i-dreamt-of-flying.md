The piece focuses on the crews of Bomber Command who sacrificed their lives in the skies to help end World War II. My intention was to illustrate the distinct contrasts between the heroic and romanticised perceptions of the R.A.F and the brutal and terrifying realities so many young airmen faced night after night.\r The film is a tribute to those men who risked their lives and to my grandfather; an RAF tail-gunner 1943-44.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y9FumM5YRCF7BuD1VO6VO2PvSst.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
