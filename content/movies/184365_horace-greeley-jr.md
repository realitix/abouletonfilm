He fights first with the gang's leader, then all join in. He manages to escape with the leader's kimono. He jumps on a mule as the gang pursues by car. Horace gets a dose of courage when he realizes that a young woman on horseback is watching. He captures the gang with a nifty bit of roping, and she holds her rifle on them. He's performed an heroic deed in front of her. Is it enough?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Harry Langdon ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
