The water, the banks, the bright lights of a port ahead; the lure of a coming paycheck and a home-cooked meal. This is the world of BARGE. A green deckhand following his father into the family business. A former convict working his way upward job by job, in the hopes of being First Mate. A thirty-eight year veteran engineer in no hurry to retire. An ancient waterway pulling a double shift as the backbone of a national economy; a tangle of thick steel cables, tied together just right. As long as the boat\u2019s moving, they\u2019re making money. An intimate portrait of the machinery of American ambitions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zIYLRgsC1G0M53tAyxhhErscbO5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
