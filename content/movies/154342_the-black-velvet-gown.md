Miller makes Riah the gift of a black velvet gown, and even educates her children. But when Riah discovers the reason behind Miller's gifts, she vows to leave his house, but Miller has a hold on her, even after his death, when he leaves his house to her on the condition that she never marry. Riah's daughter, Biddy, grows up and becomes a laundress in a large house where her education keeps her from fitting in and makes her a target. But it also catches the eye of a son of the house, and with Miller's legacies, Biddy may yet find her way to happiness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/twElor79wziVfhOQAIH4pqgaovZ.jpg", "actors": ["Bob Peck (Percival Miller)", "Janet McTeer (Riah Millican)", "Geraldine Somerville (Biddy Millican)", "Jonathan Firth (Paul Gallmington)", "David Hunt (Laurence Gallmington)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
