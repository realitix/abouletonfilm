Or should run away from, since Buster spends all his spare time provoking strangers into fights, then refusing to defend himself as they pummel him 'til they grow bored. He's also a grifter, sucking his brother dry, and a cancer, sabotaging his brother's relationship with his girlfriend. Think of him as the patron saint of passive aggression, the don of all losers, or maybe just a regular guy who lost his mind trying to avoid growing up.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nVkgDjcfLZ2aRgN3zcl4gGieGSE.jpg", "actors": ["Cosmo Inserra (Buster)", "Alex Emanuel (Scott)", "Sandra Andreis (Jesse)", "Meghan Farrell (Bess)", "Mike Funk (Rob)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
