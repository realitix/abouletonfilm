Created while in the midst of production on the feature-length GLOBALIZATION TAPES, this brief film is Oppenheimer's most concentrated piece of socio-political commentary: a quick, colorful political cartoon of capitalism plucked out-of-context and set to a soundtrack that is both comic and somewhat sinister. The upbeat musical accompaniment only enhances the empty celebration of meaningless activity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ySUbARTmmfyZDgl0VelbEC8kqil.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
