A woman searches an inner landscape, a space that closes it up and encloses it. Her dress, a projection of femininity, becomes her means of expression. The film silently moves to the point of confrontation by means of rhythmic editing; the woman opens the door to the outside world. This shocking moment of violent interaction is reinforced by the only sound in the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5McgEbh5INghp9FOz1etXowEwOb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
