It turns out that Stalin served as a Major in the Indian Army. Although a war hero, he had quit the army after a rift with the Colonel (Mukesh Rishi) transfers him to administrative division from the battlefield as a disciplinary action. His family includes mother (Sharada Urvashi) as well as his sister (Khushboo), who is not in talking terms with their mother since she got married to a Punjabi. Stalin keeps helping a physically challenged girl Sumati to write her Intermediate examination and her suicide disturbs him. The death occurs as none of the people around her extend help. Then Stalin plans a chain system. The theme works on a principle that everyone should help others and in return they should not seek a mere thanks but tell those who get the help to help three more, with a condition that those who get help from them should also demand the same.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k6X0X6uQ2jXNBy6oSSQIGIzF5kO.jpg", "actors": ["Chiranjeevi (Stalin)", "Trisha Krishnan (Trisha)", "Prakash Raj (Muddu Krishnayya)", "Sharada (mother)", "Khushboo (Sister)", "Anushka Shetty (Item song appr)", "Brahmanandam ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [63671, 63811, 80880, 77715], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
