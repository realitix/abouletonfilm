Aburdist humor is the hallmark of this pseudo-scientific description of biting, chewing, swallowing, and digesting food. The on-screen narrator begins with teeth, \"little sentinels\" as he calls them, and the tongue. Then it's on to the stomach: he describes the stomach's workings as if it were an office or a factory. He uses an illustration of the side view of a human torso, with mouth, esophagus, and stomach visible, saying it's a photograph of a man with a visible digestive tract.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Robert Benchley (Joe Doakes)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
