Hokusai lives in poverty, apprenticed as a printmaker, studying under the best artists of the day, especially Korin. Hokusai's unique style strives for realism. The camera slowly pans Hokusai's art: we see prints popular with merchants and commoners, particularly his caricatures; his subjects are often people at work. Late in life, political turmoil becomes his subject.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9pcLIrd1pqPEf70WcYKYwXf0BIE.jpg", "actors": ["Yoshi Kat\u00f4 (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [105580, 116370, 10244, 61430], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
