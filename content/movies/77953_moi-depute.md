Leur homme n'est autre que le candide Marty Huggins qui dirige l'office du tourisme du coin. Si, au d\u00e9part, Marty ne semble pas le candidat id\u00e9al, il ne tarde pas \u00e0 se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler un redoutable concurrent pour le charismatique Cam gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'aide de ses bienfaiteurs, d'un directeur de campagne sans vergogne et des relations de ses parents dans la politique. Alors que le jour du scrutin approche, les deux hommes s'engagent dans un combat impitoyable : d\u00e9sormais, tous les coups sont permis entre Cam et Marty qui n'h\u00e9sitent plus \u00e0 s'insulter et \u00e0 en venir aux mains dans un affrontement \u00e0 mort.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6uH8BOWN60mu2Vd5z4jCaVWb2ix.jpg", "actors": ["Will Ferrell (Cam Brady)", "Zach Galifianakis (Marty Huggins)", "Dylan McDermott (Tim Wattley)", "Jason Sudeikis (Mitch Wilson)", "Sarah Baker (Mitzi Huggins)", "Millard Darden (Moderator Carl Terry)", "Kya Haywood (Dylan/Clay Huggins)", "John Lithgow (Glen Motch)", "Dan Aykroyd (Wade Motch)", "Brian Cox (Raymond)", "Amelia Jackson-Gray (Becky)", "Josh Lawson (Tripp)", "Thomas Middleditch (Travis)", "Scott A.
