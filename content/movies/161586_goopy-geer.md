He gives a zany performance on the piano, but the employees and the customers are just as wacky. A gorilla waiter dances while serving. Three identical cats display a peculiar way of eating. A chicken has a nauseating way of making chicken soup. The nightclub singer tells corny jokes. Even the hat racks come to life and dance. A horse imbibing a too-strong drink provides the show-stopper.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gZs8j2dvJhLT0XmSLoQToWKY3dS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
