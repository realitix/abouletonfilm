He sang hits from the Guess Who, Bachman-Turner Overdrive, and his solo career, interspersing stories along the way, adding the biographical song \"Prairie Town\" as a framing device. This 2014 set  generally has a lower energy level than the original recordings but the relaxed vibe is part of the appeal: it's not a race, it's a nostalgic stroll with the amiable Bachman. If you're on the same wavelength as him, it's an enjoyable way to pass the time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eAOQMuLegnTYXnfdjkNA8WeLO7q.jpg", "actors": ["Randy Bachman (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
