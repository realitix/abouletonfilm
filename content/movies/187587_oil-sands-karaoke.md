These five characters know they're at the center of a global controversy and yet they continue to work there under extremely arduous physical conditions for long hours for extended periods without a single day off. Why? Obviously for the high wages. But what could motivate a person in this situation to sing karaoke, let alone take it seriously? A documentary unlike any other, Oil Sands Karaoke will make us laugh, sing along, and perhaps re-examine our biases", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fBgiJcK5l4mXIqkhsvuk8RGX5he.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
