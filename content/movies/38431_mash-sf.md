This video recognizes those who have inspired us with their unique presence in the streets, who have created an accelerated style of riding bikes built for the track but tailored for daily abuse. The synthesis of this video sprang from a desire to show the world how these locals take ownership of San Franciscos dense landscape and display an incredible amount of focus, fluidity, and grace in the process.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/taGTqT5MyVwJ98cvxr0hhgQz4se.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "VTEWIiFPDN4"}
