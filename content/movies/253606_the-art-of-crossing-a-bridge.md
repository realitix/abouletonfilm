He is creative and free-spirited, and he loves his Danish wife, but unfortunately the rules and regulations of the Danish and Swedish societies obstruct their wish to live a peaceful life. They embark on a Kafkaesque journey through the European legal systems, and end up not being allowed to stay in Denmark, or Sweden; in fact anywhere at all. As the legal decisions threaten to ruin their relationship, Camilo ultimately faces an impossible dilemma: Should he go back to Cuba, possibly ending up in prison, or should he stay in Scandinavia illegally, with or without the love of his life?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3ByBOFh2w7HefbVk8wCmwl1s7qh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
