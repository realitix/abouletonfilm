Daniel is an engineer working in Singapore, who comes from a humble Hokkien Malaysian family, while his wife-to-be Tina, comes from a well-to-do Cantonese Singaporean family. What follows the happy decision to tie the knot is a series of problems involving both families - the disparity in perceived wealth and the countless differences between Singaporean and Malaysian, Hokkien and Cantonese cultures, such that preparations for the wedding almost come to a standstill. In a show of sincerity and commitment to his demanding parents-in-law to be, Daniel agrees to hold an extravagant and lavish wedding banquet in Singapore.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xrpAxBTw24KtdFcWVXe5DA72K9t.jpg", "actors": ["Ah Niu (Daniel Chua Wei Keat)", "Elanne Kwong (Tina Chong Sze Xin)", "Kara Hui (Allison Chan)", "Shaun Chen (Jeremy)", "John Cheng (Propman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "suwD8tZdHkY"}
