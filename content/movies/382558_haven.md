They end up at the heart of suburbia, in Tel Aviv, at the bourgeois apartment Yali and Boaz. The spacious apartment suddenly seems crowded and small when tensions between the couples begin to mount. The situation is further complicated as Keren's obvious pregnancy adds to the pain of Boaz and Yali, who cannot have children of their own. The shifting relationships between the four serve to examine the tensions and complexities of Israeli society today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eCnV417aj2DhQpcVG1jCZhGJaEW.jpg", "actors": ["Oshri Cohen (Motti)", "Lana Ettinger (Yali)", "Nevo Kimchi  (Boaz)", "Rotem Zissman-Cohen (Keren)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "qlUPxa-FvFk"}
