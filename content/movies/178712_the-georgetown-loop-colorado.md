Hooked somehow to the rear of a four-car passenger train is a camera that pans the scenery and, when the train goes around curves, looks ahead to see the engine and passenger cars: the passengers wave hundreds of white handkerchiefs out of the train's left-side windows for the benefit of the camera. The town comes into view; the tracks are above the town, so the camera looks down on dozens of modest rooftops as it pans the area.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lvDFS51sBL5Gk0bNQUJc3YA4ipf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [185446, 189591, 195301, 263860], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
