The film tries to present it in a positive, and beautiful way, alluding to the fact that the curious girl wanted it to happen. The viewer can decide whether or not the film is beautiful or whether it is a glossy excuse for pedophilia. It is set just after World War II. A man has discovered and read Celine's diary which is filled with sexual longing and sensuality. The child herself, only portrayed as a photograph, describes her relations with a recently widowed hairdresser. The film contains little formal dialog and mostly focuses upon the daily lives of the people involved. The setting of the seduction is shown, but not the seduction itself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xTMA3DezZyXApRIiGSgpRYzfld1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
