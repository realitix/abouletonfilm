A blanket of fog has descended, shrouding the far side of the water in dark mist. We hear a disturbance in the sea's surface, out of our line of sight. A man staggers into view. He is stranded. Alone. He searches for answers; in the water, in the woodland, in the hills. He finds none. As he wanders deeper into the darkness of the forest, questioning his fate and destiny, he thinks back and reminisces over fragments of his life, and what has been lost. As time passes, the man finds a cabin. He feels uplifted at the thought of shelter from exposure to the elements that he has endured. Inside the shack he encounters a book that he had lost days before. He attempts to find solace in the book's pages; memories of days passed by. It consumes him. He accepts his spiritual end. It comes full circle.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yDdSKEz2Rdtk5McqJFnKhd6vJ8k.jpg", "actors": ["Ross Shaddick (He)", "Nerys Rees (She)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
