One occupied by some of the most acclaimed dancers in the world, people who move for a living. The other occupied by people who often struggle to move, people who have Parkinson's disease. This is the story of what happens when those worlds intersect. We followed individuals with Parkinson's as they prepared to stage a first ever dance performance, under the tutelage of two long time dancers at the Mark Morris Dance Group. It's a story about determination, adversity, contending with doubt, the transformative power of art and the strength of the human spirit. This is the story of a remarkable community of dancers who have come together to rediscover the meaning of grace.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jKjwIaNs0Akf1gOu4Ogc9l6cRSH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
