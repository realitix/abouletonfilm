The show was produced by Marvel Productions and Sunbow Productions, who made a pilot for NBC. The pilot aired, but for unknown reasons, it was never turned into a full-blown series. Despite it not becoming a full series, the pilot has aired in syndication, and was later released on video.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/208meMFoKbMGyho4HJ85h7wRdmD.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Bell (Cyclops (voice))", "Kath Soucie (Kitty Pryde (voice))", "Andi Chapman (Storm (voice))", "Patrick Pinney (Wolverine (voice))", "Earl Boen (Magneto (voice))", "Neil Ross (Nightcrawler (voice))", "Dan Gilvezan (Colossus (voice))", "Ron Gans (Juggernaut (voice))", "Pat Fraley (Pyro (voice))", "Alan Oppenheimer (The Blob (voice))", "Frank Welker (Toad / Lockheed (voice))", "Stan Lee (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [37338, 49076], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
