At that very moment, a female ghost appears on the scene. As she is on the verge of killing him, a male ghost also shows up. The male ghost saves him, but Atsai gives him a scolding for his trouble. Then they start sharing their woes, and end up drowning their sorrow in wine. Unfortunately, the wine is drugged and Atsai dies. Forty years later, a Taoist priest meets the ghost of Atsai, who asks for his help because he is being controlled by an old demon and cannot be reborn.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Liu Chun ()", "Peng Chia-chia ()", "Peng Peng ()", "Cheng Chin-i (Atsai)", "Fu Chuen ()", "Eric Tsang ()", "Woo Gwa ()", "Elsie Yeh ()", "Ngai Man-Yin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
