On any weekend, there may be no better place to find out what makes America great than at a flea market. A Flea Market Documentary is an unabashed celebration of the unusual people and the enticing things that can be found in parking lots, fairgrounds, drive-ins, sidewalks, and wherever else someone has posted a sign saying \"Flea Market.\"  It's capitalism mixed with craziness. It's amazing old stuff, great salespeople, the ancient tradition of the open-air market, and the possibility of finding a bargain, all uniting shoppers across the nation.  Produced by WQED Pittsburgh, A Flea Market Documentary travels from the gigantic Rose Bowl Market in Pasadena, California, to the busy but modest- sized Eastern Market in Washington, DC, talking with organizers, vendors, food merchants and shoppers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oDlMedGDsohy0Eyn199d6PF37af.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Pq20LSw87H0"}
