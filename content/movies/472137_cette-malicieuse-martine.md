His niece (Barbara Moose) comes to visit and he hires a private detective (Dominique Aveline) to keep a watch on her. Martine works as his receptionist at first and spies on him having sex with a patient (Brigitte Lahaie) who, at the end of the session inserts love balls inside herself. Martine copies this when she goes off to a shoe shop (she also seems to be working there) where Liliane Lemieuvre is a customer (non-sex). Martine has sex with the shop assistant, who notices her playing with herself. Martine has various adventures, including getting involved in a fetish dungeon scene with Diane Dubois, Marilyn Jess and Guy Royer, sex with a waiter in the hotel, watches Alban Ceray having sex with Morgane (dressed as a bride), phoning up her uncle while he has sex with his wife (Cathy Stewart) and finally with Dominique Aveline who has been following her around all this time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oHtgmnLGKgt2c89UJyDP33BOH8o.jpg", "actors": ["Brigitte Lahaie (Une cliente de l'oncle)", "Barbara Moose (Martine)", "Diane Dubois (La dominatrice (as Denise Lascene))", "Liliane Allan (Une cliente du magasin (as Liliane Lemieuvre))", "Marilyn Jess (L'assistante de la dominatrice)", "Morgane (La femme dans la serre tropicale)", "Cathy Stewart ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
