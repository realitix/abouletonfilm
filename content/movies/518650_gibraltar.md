For the past 300 years Spain has fought to regain this tiny British territory but in true David and Goliath style, the small community on the rock has fought back, choosing instead to remain British. In the summer of 2010, the director Ana Garcia returned home to Gibraltar to get married. Coming back to the most unique of British territories, she finds herself compelled to find out more about the history of her family and her birthplace. As she prepares for her wedding, we are taken on a very personal journey that uncovers the inspiring story of how a small community has fought for its homeland and identity. At times funny, at times tragic, this is a surprising tale of struggle and victory in the name of home and family.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oEv4BlQNranSUbZUvw0LjFaqW3B.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
