Alliances constantly shift. Tatsu and Takeshi, friends since boyhood, reluctantly join Shin's gang. Shin's an upstart and moves his gang often to avoid the local kingpin. Hanoko is a young woman with ambitions: first she's in the blood business with her father, then she joins forces with Shin. She soon breaks off that partnership, even though she's taken the sensitive Takeshi under her wing. Double crosses multiply. Those with the closest bonds become each others' murderers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bW60uES0XoUZI4YQQP2AZ7d6v2o.jpg", "actors": ["Masahiko Tsugawa (Shin, leader of gang)", "Kayoko Honoo (Hanako)", "Isao Sasaki (New gang member Takeshi)", "Fumio Watanabe (Yosehei)", "Kamatari Fujiwara (Batasuke, peddlar)", "Tanie Kitabayashi (Chika, Batasuke's wife)", "Junzabur\u00f4 Ban (Yotsematsu, Hanako's father)", "Y\u00fbsuke Kawazu (Gang member)", "Kei Sat\u014d (Sakaguchi, doctor)", "Rokk\u00f4 Toura (Masa, vize leader)", "Kunie Tanaka (Thief)", "Asao Koike (Black Glasses)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [113989, 188273, 182099, 131836], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
