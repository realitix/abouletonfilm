As a director, however, his forte was erotica. Like Li Han Hsiang, Ho Fan was a pioneer of the aesthetic school of erotica, known for his luscious cinematography and seductive lens. He is certainly one of the few Hong Kong erotica filmmakers to have made a respectable name for himself with Category III offerings like Adventure in Denmark, Yu Pu Tuan, and 1977's Innocent Lust.  One of Ho Fan's representative works, Innocent Lust stars Ai Fei, Chan Chun Ho, and Lam Choi as college friends who are unlucky in love. They decide to go to a night club, and are surprised to discover that their innocent-looking classmate (Chan Wai Ying) works as a hostess there. When they step up to defend her from a lecherous old man, the encounter sparks off an unexpected journey of love and lust.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vXap8p0Aye1icYj926W1qyjNQAo.jpg", "actors": ["Ho Yen (Lin Zi Ping)", "Ngaai Fei (Man Pei Tao)", "Chan Wai-Ying (Zhu Qiu Qian)", "Chan Jun-Ho (Shi Da Bang)", "Cheng Suk-Ying (Li Hui Min)", "Lam Choi (Hu Ping Lang)", "Tsang Choh-Lam (Sauna manager)", "Cheung Chok-Chow (Nightclub manager)", "San Shu-Wa (Zi Ping's father)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
