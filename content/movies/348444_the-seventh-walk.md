First glimpsed wandering the valley\u2019s dense woodlands, the painter is seen peering through the sun-dappled canopy; soon he spies a mysterious footprint and follows the forest path to the base of a gnarled old tree. There he sits in Buddha-like repose while Dutta\u2019s protean camera conjures a series of arresting images: rocks defy gravity and levitate gently upwards; lichens and moss multiply in layered afterimages mimicking Singh\u2019s intricate brushstrokes; and a celestial maiden takes to the sky, bearing ambrosial milk to the artist\u2019s darkened atelier. Dutta masterfully weaves these iconic passages together with Singh\u2019s painterly technique, merging the still and moving image into an impressionistic assemblage that pays homage to the legends, folk traditions, and artistry of this unique corner of India.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6Np6dQ11n40sEqcp0gxVmByxye3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
