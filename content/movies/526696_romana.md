His house is a unique temple, furnished with fantastic, beautiful and enigmatic drawings and other artifacts; works of art that speak of their belief, worldview and express their relationship with the transcendent. From his backyard emerge great sculptures that link the earthly world to other planes and dimensions, and speak of their religiosity, the nature of planet Earth and the future of humanity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gWUQLSm0h6LdNPPMId1YPqBGNEP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
