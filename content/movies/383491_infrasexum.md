He leaves behind his old life and tries to discover a simpler happiness through painting and meeting new friends. Wanting to save him from a sexless fate, his friend (director Carlos Tobalina in a supporting role) attempts to solve the mystery of his sexual shortcomings, through any means possible.  Filled with incredible footage of Las Vegas, the Sierra Nevada and elsewhere, as well as subplots involving kidnapping, and even a bit of unexpected gore, filmmaker Carlos Tobalina\u2019s debut feature is a totally unique sexploitation experiment that showcases many of the stylistic touches that would become his trademarks, along with a cast of beautiful starlets, including Sharon Matt and Marsha Jordan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zFaxR2waLHGEOwSBcYU0U1Zfy1b.jpg", "actors": ["Eroff Lynn ()", "Sharon Matt ()", "Marsha Jordon ()", "William Kirschner ()", "Carlos Tobalina ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
