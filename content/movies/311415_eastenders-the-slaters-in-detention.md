When three generations of the Slaters - Kat, Little Mo, Lynn, Zoe and Mo - go up town, it could only really end with a night in a police cell. But straight out of the disco, the fiery Slater girls - dressed in school uniforms - are far too hot for the local constabulary to handle.  With time on their hands they have an opportunity to look back on their lives; Mo's bust-ups, Lynn's altercations at the altar, Kat's confrontation with her past, Little Mo's nightmare with evil Trevor and a cauldron of steamy romances. When not flirting with the night sergeant, they give the inside story on the Slater highs and lows; the passion, the heartbreak, the fights and laughter of a family that doesn't know the meaning of the phrase \"The quiet life.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yjllyUmopRiSe7qJPpOKHcPsAVh.jpg", "actors": ["Michelle Ryan (Zoe Slater)", "Elaine Lordan (Lynne Hobbs)", "Jessie Wallace (Kat Slater)", "Kacey Ainsworth (Little Mo Mitchell)", "Laila Morse (Mo Harris)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
