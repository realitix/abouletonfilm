Investigators uncover a possible liaison between the dead sailor and the writer's wife, and also learn that Sayed's successful fictions owed much to the inspiration of his brother Mahmoud's adventurous life. Just as the evidence against the novelist seems overwhelming, Mahmoud turns up alive. But why are the twins never seen together...? In this very personal film, one can see the symbolic outlines of the uneasy relationship between Egyptian intellectuals and the problems of the proletariat.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xPDL1BJ5BohOryhO7RvN1NxJZza.jpg", "actors": ["Ezzat El Alaili ()", "Seif El Dine ()", "Mahmoud el-Meliguy ()", "Soad Hosny ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
