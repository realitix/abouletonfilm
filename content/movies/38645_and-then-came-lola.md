But, as usual, Lola is late. With her job and girlfriend on the line, she has three chances to make it right. In a desperate race through the streets and back rooms of San Francisco, time grows short-will Lola make it? Will she come at all? With a pop sensibility that mixes live action, animation and still photography, And Then Came Lola explores love's age old question in a fresh new way, \"If you try, try again, will you finally get it right?\" (Written by M. Siler and E. Seidler)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9wOq17Wp9L5NLLRmsjR2qlvdBbm.jpg", "actors": ["Ashleigh Sumner (Lola)", "Jill Bennett (Casey)", "Cathy DeBuono (Danielle)", "Jessica Graham (Jen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [45020, 73846, 58887, 21891], "youtube_key": "M1TV7m1koZk"}
