From a standing start in Brazil, through 16 races, 4 continents and a flying finish in Adelaide, the 1987 season provided non-stop entertainment with spectacular racing - all supported by on-board and pit-lane footage,  technical insights and characterful interviews.  Williams-Honda teammates Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet fought it out all season long whilst checking for Ayrton Senna\u2019s Lotus and the McLaren of Alain Prost in their rearview mirrors.  Mansell should have had it with 6 wins to Piquet\u2019s three, but a crash in Japan settled the title in the Brazilian\u2019s favour.  Narrated by Academy-Award-winning actor Peter Ustinov.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Peter Ustinov (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
