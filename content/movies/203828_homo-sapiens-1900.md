Eugenics is to be the scientific credo of the 20th century. The man credited with its invention, Francis Galton, says it is based on the concept that the evolution of man is crippled by the ill-conceived - those unfit to breed. The study of eugenics thus would concern itself with distinguishing the weed from the good flowers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nSdrehaoEd3pZ8iM08zcaiecJuE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
