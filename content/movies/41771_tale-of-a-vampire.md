The only woman he ever loved was lost to him centuries ago...but there's a new woman in his life, a woman named Ann who bears an extraordinary resemblance to Virginia, the young girl Alex once loved. Ann has recently lost a love of her own to a fiery car crash, and lives deep in her own gray depression. After an anonymous letter leads her to a new job in an occult library, Ann begins a slow, hesitant courtship with Alex, whom she finds both attractive and a little spooky. Alex, confused and jaded (and also unable to refrain from imagining himself feeding on Ann) holds her at arms length. But the fears and emotions of Alex and Ann are not the only complications in their relationship. There's another man stalking them both...a man named Edgar, who was once married to Virginia and has been looking for Alex for a very long time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6twZI05ulOI9bKt9gL72eH08Ltu.jpg", "actors": ["Julian Sands (Alex)", "Kenneth Cranham (Edgar)", "Suzanna Hamilton (Ann)", "Marian Diamond (Denise)", "Mark Kempner (Morgue Official)", "Oliver Smith (Bum)", "David King (Waiter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [50407], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
