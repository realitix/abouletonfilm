She helps plot against him, and the Vicious Long Brothers invade his home and steal the Golden Dragon Blade - a sword that makes its wielder unbeatable. Zhishan, crippled in the attack, and his young daughter are whisked away by a devoted servant, and the trio soon find shelter in the home of an herbalist. Years pass, the daughter grows up to be a lovely young woman and a powerful fighter, and the Long Brothers use the Golden Dragon Blade to gain power in the region. Zhishan's family of sorts has managed to stay well hidden, but a trip into the city - the daughter's first - sets off an old power struggle as Zhishan's wife discovers her daughter is quite alive.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1pjj3ntm333xz5QK464KzU0hZce.jpg", "actors": ["Chin Ping (Li Xiaoyan)", "Elliot Ngok (Liu Qingsong)", "Tang Ching (Li Zhishan)", "Kao Pao-shu (Mrs Li Yuexiang)", "Goo Man-Chung (Liu Anzheng)", "Lee Pang-Fei (Long Zhentian)", "Chiu Hung (Long Zhenxiong)", "Law Hon (Long Zhenying)", "Ngai Ping-Ngo (Master Jin)", "Wong Ching-Ho (medicine shopkeeper)", "Hao Li-Jen (Wang Shun)", "Tsang Choh-Lam (Ah Sheng)", "Lam Yuen (Zhang Debiao)", "Sammo Hung (Long's man / Escort man)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [115651, 90562], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
