Cowboy and Indian are always up to some harebrained scheme, with Horse left to clean up the mess. In Christmas Panic, their out-of-control antics lead Horse to call Santa and cancel the presents. But the boys figure they can still save Christmas\u2026 if they break into their neighbor\u2019s house to steal his yule log! In Back to School Panic, a class assignment yields a special prize, but only Pig knows the answer. Cowboy and Indian use a special shrinking potion to sneak into Pig\u2019s brain, where they discover a sodium-packed world of pig cops riding in bacon cars and sausage cycles.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ahO73l5oV8D148XbJ7cFYiKUNhw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "l4x9UJs-DgI"}
