Emotions run high since it is the one-year anniversary of the death of John's brother, the handsome and charismatic Tony, who had also been Lyle`s lover. Marian, who is still inconsolable after losing Tony to AIDS, is upset when Lyle brings his new boyfriend, a young artist, Robert. Meanwhile, the situation is just as tense at the Kerr`s neighbors' house, where oft-widowed, free spirit Laura Ponti gets a surprise visit from her resentful, angry daughter, Nina, and her married lover, Thierry. Matters worsen when the battling mother-daughter duo joins the Kerr household for a dinner party, where the pain-riddled diners engage in a messy emotional showdown.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rb9Utxqn4DVsSxxkXuNwxNkjr81.jpg", "actors": ["Gena Rowlands (Laura Ponti)", "Brooke Shields (Nina)", "Deborah Kara Unger (Marian Kerr)", "Jared Harris (John Kerr)", "David Conrad ()", "James Duval ()", "D.
