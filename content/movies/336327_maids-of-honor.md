Through a theatrical reenactment of the painting's pictorial tableau and a re-articulation of its complex perspectival structure, Downey brings to life the spatial dynamics, illustrating the psychological tension of the relationship between viewer and subject. Placing Las Meninas in a historical context, Downey relates the painting's thematics to Spain's economic and political systems of the late 17th century.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4vnkVc7515t0dNI4Batc4ZLD3tF.jpg", "actors": ["Carmen Beuchat (Herself)", "Suzanne Harris (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
