He forms The Rock 'n' Roll Brothers band with his friends. One night as they are performing live, a woman like a typhoon appears. Her name is Saki Utagawa (Fumi Nikaid\u014d). She is a charismatic and popular digital top idol who performs with a unique style.  Takur\u014d has as much freedom as anyone but isn't popular, while Saki performs as a top idol but suffers because she can't do the music she wants. They each possess what the other lacks. One day, Saki gives Takur\u014d a request. She says, \"Please, write me a song. There's no more time for me.\" And so, the fates of the \"strongest rock idiot in history\" and the \"savage idol\" become one.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7QJqaKpzrKgCoBGDrSBj9O2l3pE.jpg", "actors": ["Shuuhei Nomura (Takuro Hibinuma)", "Fumi Nikaido (Saki Utagawa)", "Tomoya Maeno (Mamoru Kusakabe)", "Keisuke Okamoto (Akira Yoda)", "Motoki Ochiai (Shinjo)", "Yutaro Furutachi (Yuichiro Inukai)", "Yoko Kita (Machiko Machida)", "Yoshikazu Ebisu (Shocho san)", "Tomoko Mariya (Izumi Kazama)", "Naoto Takenaka (Takeshi Matsumoto)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "FDPTCnsGf6k"}
