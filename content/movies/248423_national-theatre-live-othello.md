Othello, newly married to Desdemona \u2013 who is half his age \u2013 is appointed leader of a major military operation. Iago, passed over for promotion by Othello in favour of the young Cassio, persuades Othello that Cassio and Desdemona are having an affair.  Olivier Award-winning actor Adrian Lester (Henry V at the National Theatre, BBC\u2019s Hustle) takes the title role. Playing opposite him as the duplicitous Iago is fellow Olivier Award-winner Rory Kinnear (The Last of the Haussmans, James Bond: Skyfall), who is reunited with director Nicholas Hytner (Timon of Athens, One Man, Two Guvnors) following their acclaimed collaboration on the National Theatre\u2019s recent production of Hamlet.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iBxon2EesoyUZPO1ciYg9kZTQZb.jpg", "actors": ["Adrian Lester (Othello)", "Rory Kinnear (Iago)", "Jonathan Bailey (Cassio)", "Lyndsey Marshal (Emilia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Cuza9jF7zgg"}
