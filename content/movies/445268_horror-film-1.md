Projected onto the same screen \u2013 the centre image large and the two side images smaller and superimposed into the centre of the larger screen. The performing body casts complex colour shadow. The action begins touching the screen and - passing through the space of the audience \u2013 it ends at the projectors. The actions are timed to an audio tape of breathing. Though improvised in detail to fit the particular time and place, the action follows a consistent pattern that has changed little since the first performance.\".", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Malcolm Le Grice (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
