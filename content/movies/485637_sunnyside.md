Sixty feet down the hill lives his eccentric 84-year-old friend and neighbor, architect and former Frank Lloyd Wright collaborator Daniel Liebermann. These extraordinary old men, influential artists in the 1950s and \u201960s, continue, each in their own way, to search the world for perfection.  Sunnyside takes us to an extraordinary place, a microcosm with its own distinctive rhythm and remarkable inhabitants. It is a film about creativity, the capacity to dream and, ultimately, the transience of life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/up69XtMJRxsRjtaj7WM1yJ9jQgP.jpg", "actors": ["Henry Jacobs (Himself)", "Daniel Liebermann (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
