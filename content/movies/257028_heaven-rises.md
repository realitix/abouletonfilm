Following the prescriptions of the doctor, he must take complete rest, \"not a single movement, not a single thught\".  Stretched on a hammock, Juan de Dios must resign to \"sinking himself in the boredom, just like a castaway at sea\". But suddenly he realizes that \timmobility is something impossible:  Juan de Dios sees himself overwhelmed by a myriad of physical, sound, optical and olfactory sensations,which awaken his spirit.
