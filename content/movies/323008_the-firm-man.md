His work in the organisation turns out to be of a unique and somewhat disturbing nature. But Gerald finds no comfort with his wife Melissa and friend Barry - his relationships with both collapse. In a surreal and strange fashion, Gerald eventually comes to understand what The Firm is about.  Made on a tiny budget of $15,000 the film is a mix of naturalism and stylisation which the filmmaker hoped would work on 'a simple, surrealistic level'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5Dqao19lfjACf9e63ssVHVbTJ3z.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
