With some prodding, the tourists unwittingly reveal an unattractive and pervasive ethnocentrism to O'Rourke's cameras. The tourists thus become somewhat dehumanized by the camera, even as the tourists themselves are busy exoticizing even the most mundane aspects of Sepik River life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8vlaKiw5yveRAu3i2add2e32Jke.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
