See the launch of Frances CoRot and Americas Kepler missions, and the smoking hot worlds they discover. See a controversial and tantalizing discovery of a planet where life could exist in a strange twilight zone, that is, if the planet really exists. Astronomers are working to determine what conditions are necessary for life to exist, and they are building the radical James Webb Space Telescope, a spacecraft that can look at the atmosphere around a planet and reveal whether or not life as we know it actually exists. It could be the greatest discovery in human history and it could change how we see ourselves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3xN26EWSedoOuVd1POnXDFK6n8N.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
