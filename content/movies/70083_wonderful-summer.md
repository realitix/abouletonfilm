Now, in her late teens, she makes her first life choices. Her grandfather, her father and even her late mother are determined to help the adolescent girl. However, suffering from the family trauma and in constant conflict with each other, they themselves seem to need help. They do not make it any easier for Kitka so the girl decides to take matters into her own hands. She embarks on a series of funny adventures, meets a number of strange characters and experiences first romantic entanglements.
