A group of young friends go on a camping trip in the countryside, where Ken encounters a mysterious woman near a grave. Afterward, Ken's life is changed forever as he becomes a victim of ghost meddling. As the friends journey back to Hong Kong without Ken, another sinister story takes place. Mrs. To has a date with her husband to celebrate their wedding anniversary, but becomes concern when he doesn't show up. The outcome of this second story leads to Ken's friend Jojo being courted by a ghost, and ultimately leads to the final story where Peter Butt unknowingly visits a haunted theater with some of Ken's friends.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p3gei6C4MYkSGEFoqLCPELOaaSJ.jpg", "actors": ["Simon Lui (Peter Butt)", "Louis Koo (Ken Ng Chi Keung)", "Allen Ting (Ball)", "Jason Chu (Bee)", "Ada Choi (Ken's love interest)", "Teresa Mak (JoJo)", "Bak Ka-Sin (Fat girl in 1st story)", "Helena Law Lan (Ghost Granny)", "Lee Lik-Chi (Director)", "Frankie Ng (Ng Tai Hung)", "Kingdom Yuen (Sister Dan)", "Christy Chung (Mrs. To)", "Sunny Chan (Mr To Ka Ming)", "Hui Fan (Antique shop boss)", "Lee Siu-Kei (Dr Ho)", "Christine Ng (May)", "Ivy Leung Si-Man (Ghost audience in theatre)", "Kenix Kwok (Ann)", "Lui Tat (Uncle Ho)", "Hau Woon-Ling (Boat woman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
