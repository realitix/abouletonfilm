In this video, the bodies are not near or far: they are large or small. The horizons change and no space is independent of the person observing it. Incorporating only memory, the landscape is seen in a variety of speeds and movements applying a corporeal logic to the vision.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8cuge0BeL3IC4UoO3ZoVXMVkF4D.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
