One of the dads is their manager; we hear from him and one of the moms at whose house they rehearse. The lads talk about their playing, singing, and song writing. The gig is a success and all the CDs sell.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
