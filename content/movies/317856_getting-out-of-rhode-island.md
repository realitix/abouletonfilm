Nothing's scripted and everything's game as Mattison travels to Rhode Island for a homecoming party of sorts thrown by a childhood archenemy, Morgan Stipe (Jeremy Banks), who now supposedly wants to be his friend. In truth, Stipe sees Mattison as a means to go Hollywood himself.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
