The Noon Gun sends a rattle through the old wooden homes of the North End. Within one of these homes, an elderly woman dotes over her graffiti writer grandson. An interracial couple walk tensely down a side street. A recovering alcoholic cop lectures his street-wizened young partner as they walk the beat. On one day in particular, the Noon Gun blast ties these groups into a sequence of events. As these events unfold, each group\u2019s perspective grows, obscuring reality and ultimately effecting each other\u2019s lives.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
