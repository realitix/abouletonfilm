In Jane's Journey, we travel with her across several continents, from her childhood home in England, to the Gombe National Park in Tanzania where she began her groundbreaking research and where she still returns every year to enjoy the company of the chimpanzees that made her famous. Featuring a wide range of interviews and spectacular footage from her own private collection, Jane's Journey is an inspiring portrait of the private person behind the world-famous icon.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eitBKXrqJsKrqw385RQmz90ehZD.jpg", "actors": ["Angelina Jolie (herself)", "Pierce Brosnan (himself)", "Jane Goodall (herself)", "Kofi Annan (Himself)", "Hugo Eric Louis van Lawick (Himself)", "Hugo van Lawick (Himself)", "Judy Waters (Herself)", "Merlin van Lawick (Himself)", "Angel van Lawick (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [32045], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
