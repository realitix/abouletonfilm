He used to love to party, make music, and let himself drift through Berlin. Then six years ago, he suddenly became a Muslim. He broke off contact with his old friends and his old ways. Now as a Salafi, every question has an answer by the rules of fundamental Islam. By filming him, I go in search of our lost bond of brotherly love and suddenly find myself on a journey with him, that goes beyond a religious exploration.\" - Eli Roland Sachs", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9EfVvcqEaEecEqp7HT6fTHx4pht.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
