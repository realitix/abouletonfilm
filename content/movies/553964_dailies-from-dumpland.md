Here, superficiality overcomes necessities, and life-inspirations only exist on screen or glossy paper. The souls are essentially turned towards the Dollar God, provoking envious vertigo, jealousy and frustrations. In a stream of images accumulated on a daily basis, M. Woods transcribes the symptoms of a frail society. If the \u201cnumb spiral\u201d is a disease, \u201cDailies from Dumpland\u201d and its endless visual flow might just be the remedy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xx5t758OvxiUgUMGXtujd3RH29P.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
