Montgomery plays a former movie idol hired by the government to woo a young heiress (Ann Blyth). Someone had previously given the girl some jewelry stolen by the Nazis during the war, and the government wants to find out who that someone was. In the grand tradition, Montgomery pursues Blyth until she finally catches him. Produced by longtime Alfred Hitchcock associate Joan Harrison, Once More, My Darling is more conservatively directed than Montgomery's earlier works, though the director earns at least one laugh by playing a clever editing joke.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/agCHD3qo8gPj4TPx9VkhKW9vkJC.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Montgomery (Collier Laing)", "Ann Blyth (Marita Connell)", "Jane Cowl (Mrs. Laing)", "Charles McGraw (Herman Schmelz)", "Lillian Randolph (Mamie)", "Taylor Holmes (Jed Connell)", "Roland Winters (Col.
