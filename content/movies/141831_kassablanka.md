Mr. Van Loock is a rabid supporter of the extreme right-wing political party Flemish bloc. Mr. Fawzi, a Moroccan immigrant, is a conservative Muslim. In October 2000, one week prior to a hotly contested national election, 17-year-old Leilah Fawzi falls for 19-year-old Berwout Van Loock. This development sparks a sometimes hilarious and sometimes politically incorrect love story that explores the thin walls between love and hate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9L1njyAGojmnNRuBE6n6TUv5Ege.jpg", "actors": ["Roy Aernouts (Berwout Van Loock)", "Mo Barich (Mostafa Fawzi)", "Mostafa Benkerroum (Mohamed Abdelouafi)", "Amid Chakir (Nonkel Nourredine)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
