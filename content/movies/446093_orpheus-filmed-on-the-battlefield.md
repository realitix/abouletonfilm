The film, which was never provided a soundtrack, was screened on several occasions with a soundtrack performed live consisting of a text for three voices and a number of musical pieces, among which were the \u201cdescent into hell\u201d from the opera L\u2019Orfeo by Monteverdi in the version by Edward H. Tarr, released in 1968 by Erato, \u201cNew York 1963 \u2013 America 1968\u201d from Every One of Us by Eric Burdon and the Animals; and \u201cThe Return of the Son of the Monster Magnet\u201d from Freak Out by [Frank Zappa and] The Mothers of Invention. After the \u201cstate of emergency\u201d in January 1969, an epilogue was shot but it was never developed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uhB8ajABgYz2nDvIw4Anfn6zf2l.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
