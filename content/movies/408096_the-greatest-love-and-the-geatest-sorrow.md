The film begins with the funeral of Beethoven, at which Schubert was a torch-bearer, His story is told almost entirely in music written in the twenty months that remained to him after that date, together with quotations from Schubert's letters, diaries and the words that he chose to set in some of his songs.  Includes personal introductions by Christopher Nupen and Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9 and features the legendary 1969 performance of The Trout with Daniel Barenboim, Itzhak Perlman, Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9, Pinchas Zukerman and Zubin Mehta.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f3cMaaRXqijmsq0R7hehcAT72sU.jpg", "actors": ["Daniel Barenboim ()", "Jaqueline du Pr\u00e9 ()", "Pinchas Zukerman ()", "Zubin Mehta ()", "Vladimir Ashkenazy ()", "Michael Sanderling ()", "Andreas Schmidt ()", "Antje Weithaas ()", "Wolfgang Sawallisch ()", "Itzhak Perlman ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
