But in the meantime here's Volume 2. Volume two of the Jackass series contains a random, haggard selection of segments and bits that aired on our crappy little television show. Remarkable moments in this half-ass collection include Chris Pontius masquerading as an American werewolf and creating panic in the streets of London, Johnny Knoxville sticking his arm right up a cow's butt, Bam Margera and Brandon Dicamillo taking the hockey gloves off and brawling in the middle of a caf\u00e9, Ehren McGhehey falling flat on his pink face while skateboarding blindfolded, and a bunch of other absurd stunts, pranks and queer misbehavior from our bumbling cat and crew of idiots.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bZwUM8zVM97tmOSpbiCq3KblUqs.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Knoxville (Himself)", "Steve-O (Himself)", "Brandon DiCamillo (Himself)", "Bam Margera (Himself)", "Jason Acu\u00f1a (Himself)", "Preston Lacy (Himself)", "Ehren McGhehey (Himself)", "Chris Pontius (Himself)", "Dave England (Himself)", "Jeff Tremaine (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [347112, 347115, 41392, 23377], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
