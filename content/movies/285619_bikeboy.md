He's also horse-hung! His boyish charm and bulging shorts make him the Speederz' favorite. But not everybody's his friend. Nasty Nick the dispatcher is jealous of Danny's favour with the boss, and he's cooking up an evil scheme. Today will be a day they all remember for a very long time. Danny's unwitting cockfest introduces some of the hottest guys ever seen in a Eurocreme production... and some of the biggest cocks! It's all brought together with a blistering debut from Swiss dreamboat Tom Schwarz and an upbeat 70's electro soundtrack from master composer Kinky Roland. There won't be a dry eye in the house!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Josh Cooke (Straight Plumber)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
