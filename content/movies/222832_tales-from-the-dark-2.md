She gets hold of a Chinese herbal pillow that eventually helps her fall asleep again but it also draws her near something unexpected. \"Hide And Seek\" casts a group of young newcomers into an abandoned school campus where they meet longtime janitor Mr. Chan who takes shelter at the school. Playing hide-and-seek after midnight, the teenagers go missing, one after another. In his self-directed piece \"Black Umbrella,\" Teddy Robin makes solving conflicts on the street at night his mission and marks each closed case with his signature black umbrella. Before he calls it a day, he meets a prostitute who forcefully pulls him upstairs for business and unfortunately things spiral out of control.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nCN2VetE76zV6rPlW5Z5FnD3N8O.jpg", "actors": ["Fala Chen (Chow Ching-Yi)", "Gordon Lam (Yun Ho-Hong)", "Tony Ho (Dr. Kwan)", "Joman Chiang (Mabel)", "Chan Yiu-Wing (Fatty Keung)", "Sham Ka-Ki (Char-Siu)", "Kiki Tam Kei-Kei (Ceci)", "Ronny Yuen (Tat)", "Pam Cheung (Princess)", "Tong Kit-Leung (C Hing)", "Wong Yat-Ho (Sissy)", "Jacqueline Chan (Little Bo)", "Teddy Robin (Uncle Lam)", "Mo Qi-Wen (Zhenni/Jenny)", "Cheung Kwok-Keung (Minibus driver)", "Kelvin Kwan (Druggie robber)", "Vincent Wan Yeung-Ming (Landlord Bo)", "Lanna Wong (Woman in red)", "Yee Tin-Hung (Keung)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [208621, 137618], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
