She occasionally then begins cutting herself, causing her husband, Yoshio, to intervene. Yoshio attempts to help Naoko by dressing as a woman, \"Yoshiko\", in whom Naoko can confide. Yoshio has a low sex drive, and hopes to stimulate his interest by having Naoko dress as a school girl. When so attired, shopping for appropriately adolescent socks, Naoko meets Kimiko, one of her female students. Kimiko's parents have abandoned her, and she stays with a strange man named Tokio. Naoko suggests that Kimiko come to live with her. At their home, Kimiko proceeds to seduce both Naoko and her husband. During a sex session with Yoshio, she binds him and paints obscenities onto his body.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/icaxKkgZMP4DCi5vawPT7I4hwIB.jpg", "actors": ["Takeshi It\u00f4 ()", "Mikio Sat\u00f4 ()", "Mitsuyo Suwa ()", "Atsuko Suzuki ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
