Tony recognizes the man as Jorny, mayor of Avalonia, a straitlaced town where Tony was once arrested for playing his hurdy-gurdy. After this meeting, Tony's travels take him again to Avalonia. Camped on the outskirts of town, he meets June Ramsey, a cousin of the mayor's wife, ejected from town by the mayor because his reelection campaign is jeopardized by her having been seen in a roadhouse. Under considerable pressure because he wishes to conceal his previous encounter with Tony from the opposition, Jorny returns Tony's favor by asking June's forgiveness and inviting her to return to Avalonia. June accepts his apologies; she then follows Tony, with whom she has fallen in love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dDDSCtW135yss72YMkDVaGXJ4ue.jpg", "actors": ["Leo Carrillo (Antonio Camaradino)", "Virginia Valli (June Ramsey)", "Gareth Hughes (Joe)", "Frank Reicher (Milton Jorny)", "Eugenie Besserer (Mrs. Jorny)", "Lewis Franklin (Earl Jorny)", "Francis Ford ()", "Lloyd Ingraham ()", "Gus Leonard ()", "Viola Louie ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
