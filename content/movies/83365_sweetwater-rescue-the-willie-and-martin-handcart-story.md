They left too late from England in their 6,000 mile journey to the Salt Lake Valley. Nearly one fifth of these 1200 pioneers perished in the worst overland migration disaster in American history. The tragedy could have been catastrophic had a rescue effort not been launched immediately upon learning of their plight. Facing a series of blizzards, more than a hundred wagon teams and nearly 300 men were ultimately involved in one of the greatest rescue efforts of 19th Century America.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ipqD7RrU8eyntjOlti4h10gDJ0V.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
