Separated from the city by a river and bounded by towering sandstone cliffs, everyone attempts to live and survive in their own way. Foreigners who have a go at being Swiss, and Swiss who observe with scepticism. They meet in the corner shop run by an Iraqi living in exile, send their kids to a children\u2019s club managed by a missionary, and old drinking mates meet regularly over a beer in the neighbourhood\u2019s only bar. Despite all the differences, they are rather proud of the fact that they come from here.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6NlpP7SbfFxoduo7M0WiIiLBAh0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "swvPp1aD1tw"}
