This almost lost classic of recent Portuguese cinema was shot in 1991 but only completed in 2002, and has barely been seen outside Portugal since. Deadpan and dreamy, it\u2019s a work of bone-deep melancholy, a young man\u2019s film that bears the scars of age.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hCiBBjUwRbt8p9LNHXkE78l3yA6.jpg", "actors": ["Pedro Hestnes (Xavier)", "Cristina Carvalhal (Rosa)", "Jos\u00e9 Meireles (Hip\u00f3lito)", "Sandra Faleiro (Lu\u00edsa)", "Canto e Castro (Alves)", "Isabel de Castro (Irm\u00e3 Luz)", "Isabel Ruth (Laura)", "Jos\u00e9 Pedro Gomes (Pires)", "Rog\u00e9rio Samora (Tiago)", "Alexandra Lencastre (Carla)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
