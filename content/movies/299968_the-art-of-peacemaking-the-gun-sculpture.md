Groups as diverse as the PLO, the Israeli Army, Sinn Fein, and the Loyalist UDP supported the project. This sculpture was created by Edmonton artists Sandra Bromley and Wallis Kendal to stimulate discussion on violence, victims and the desire for peace at home and around the world. It was exhibited at the Edmonton Art Gallery and then invited to Seoul, Korea for the 100th Anniversary of the Nobel Peace Prize and to New York City for The United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
