The couple flee south soon after Gu presents Dan with a wedding gift - the precious white silk dress his mother had owned (his one valuable possession), while he promises her a proper marriage someday in the future. The couple arrive in the seaside town of Hoi An and build a new life, with Dan ultimately giving birth to 4 daughters. Despite struggling through immense poverty and hardships, the family is happy and fulfilled as long as they have each other, but the horrors of the encroaching war brings tragedy and threatens to tear them apart.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/52aF9S7zc4aS859KRHZIXnfrzBD.jpg", "actors": ["Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Ng\u1ecdc \u00c1nh (Dau)", "Khanh Quoc Nguyen (Gu)", "Nh\u01b0 Qu\u1ef3nh Nguy\u1ec5n ()", "Bach Thuy Tong ()", "Thi\u00ean T\u00fa Tr\u1ea7n (Ngo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
