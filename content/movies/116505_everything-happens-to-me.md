Angel and Edu share a flat. Angel, who is handsome and strait-laced, is planning to get married, and as his marriage draws closer, Edu, a sloppy punk, begins to resent Angel's impending union with suspicious voracity. Meanwhile, in the flat downstairs, Txell and Aina are a lesbian couple whose relationship is faltering. They share their lodging with Elena, an obnoxious heterosexual who has the habit of annoying everyone with her inability to shut up. Elena is looking for love, and soon sets her sights on Oscar, Edu's prospective new roommate.
