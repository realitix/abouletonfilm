Both films were shot on the spur of the moment; the difference between the two is that ARE WE REALLY SO FAR FROM THE MADHOUSE? was made specifically for Yang Haisong, whose music I had regrettably never used even though he had suggested it many times, while INNER EAR INFLAMMATION is 100% ruthless contraband. The shooting and production were completed in a very short period of time, but this doesn't mean it was sloppily done. In fact, INNER EAR INFLAMMATION is by far the least regrettable of all of my works to date, including the feature films. -Li Hongqi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rCU0822ymCFnXhO9L1jayUAhMve.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
