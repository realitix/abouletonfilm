Slower more atmospheric songs were then selected to end the Weekend on the Sunday night, creating a completely different show and feel.  Mixed by Dave Meegan and available on audio downloads as Smoke and Mirrors, the 2 live shows included on Bootleg Butlins were filmed using only 3 cameras.  This DVD gives you the feel of being not just AT but IN the show - a true memento of the Marillion Weekend 2005.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aw52PrtJMxjXa6J6rkkBnuozVNa.jpg", "actors": ["Steve Hogarth ()", "Steve Rothery ()", "Mark Kelly ()", "Ian Mosley ()", "Pete Trewavas ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
