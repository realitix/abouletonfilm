It will cast a new light on our contemporary system of imprisonment whilst revealing our changing attitudes to crime over the ages. In a time of credit crunch and economic crisis, Piers eye-opening exploration of debt will show how 300 years ago punishments did not necessarily fit the crime.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hVuzCWVSnJeUuLan1flyAIqdHmk.jpg", "actors": ["Martin Hancock ()", "Jonathan Hansler ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
