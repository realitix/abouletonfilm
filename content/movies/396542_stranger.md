When she finds a small, trendy statue to complete her and her boyfriends bedroom, the Goodwill purchase seems like a good investment. Little does she know that the statue is a cursed relic of an ancient Goddess specializing in deception. As they sleep the powers of the statue come to life causing Chris and Liz to mistake each other for a foul monster, so naturally the only option left is to try and destroy it.
