In fact there really isn't a whole lot gangsterism's in it, it's more of a character-study and focuses more on family life than anything else.\r\n\r\nPrimo is a real five star general blood gangmember and he plays a version of himself. The teenager is definitly not a part of the life, and he does not quite make his character believable in that regard for me. So a bit of a miscast there perhaps.\r\n\r\nAs far as the rating goes, definitly not a 5 star but a 5.5/10 from me."}], "recommandations_id": [28161, 422553, 297733, 285856]}
