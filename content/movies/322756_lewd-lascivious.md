Surprisingly, an unlikely group of straight ministers see the injustices firsthand, and work, for the first time, with the queer community to do something about it. Yet, simply having a dance to raise funds for their cause is enough for the cops to show up in mass, invite the private party, and start making arrests. What happens next becomes a pivotal, yet little-known, moment in gay, lesbian and trans history, not to mention in San Francisco history, too!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3e1VfKCCdzkDBQGWcbQfakqISdu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
