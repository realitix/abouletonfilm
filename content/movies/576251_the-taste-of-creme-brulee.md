Their care and attention is shared between the house and the garden. Their daily life, serene and unhurried, is full of memories and small tasks. They do not make plans for the future \u2013 it just happens day after day - like tapestries which are made with neither paper pattern nor prior drawing. Whilst the garden reveals the passing of time, the house seems to live with quivering light and trembling breath. Illness arrives, unannounced apart from that of age itself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yY0CNW7Gld6So0D9p2hpkJI65qd.jpg", "actors": ["Hiroatsu Suzuki (Directing)", "Rossana Torres (Directing)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
