He comes across Robinson Crusoe. Crusoe's parrot pecks Jerry's finger so he plucks it from its perch and swings it around by the tail. Crusoe is listening to a radio set through headphones. Jerry borrows the headphones and dances to some music. He then walks off, smashing the radio by accident as he does so. Jerry almost falls off a cliff. He takes out a buried treasure map, he dreams of all the riches he will acquire, money, a car, a big juicy bone.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gRkUe2YpfAFLBOs6QdmGn0AJUPn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
