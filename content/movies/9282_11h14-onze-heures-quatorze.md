We see the accident, which occurs at 11:14pm, from different perspectives, as the puzzle slowly comes together.\r\n\r\nSure, the story works a lot on coincidence, but it's still a great build up and interesting ending, despite it being somewhat of a let-down.\r\n\r\nThe very black humour includes two sections which might just be some of the most cringing moments for men in cinema history \u2013 one of them in particular had me cowering fear.\r\n\r\nGood performances from Patrick Swayze and Hilary Swank make this a good cinematic treat."}], "recommandations_id": [9828, 7304, 8270, 13641], "youtube_key": "XS8gh5qMlFw"}
