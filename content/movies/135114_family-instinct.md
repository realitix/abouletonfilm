Zanda is a 28-year-old woman, worn out by hard work. Surrounded by poverty and despair, she is trying to survive with her two children in a god-forsaken Latvian village. Her hardships can be traced back to living in a relationship with her brother Valdis. When Valdis is put in jail, the local community forces her to make a difficult choice: to stay with him or with her children. Despite her ill fortune, she manages to express her love for the children, still hoping to save her family. The film offers a tragicomic but highly authentic insight into the bleak reality of Latvian countryside today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jsN1ap3wlGEI8CRv46xWxqduMQs.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
