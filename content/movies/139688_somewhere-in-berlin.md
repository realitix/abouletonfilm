For Gustav, Willi and their friends the rubble provides an adventurous, dangerous playground. Especially for Gustav, it helps pass the time, as he longs for his father's return from a POW camp. One day a stranger arrives, looking helpless and hopeless... Gerhard Lamprecht built his reputation during the 1920s and '30s with films like Emil and the Detectives (1931, script Billy Wilder) and socially-critical Berlin films based on the drawings of Heinrich Zille. In Somewhere in Berlin-his first postwar film, made just months after the cessation of hostilities-he portrays the people of the shattered city with precision and psychological realism.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4FTx6VMkOZfit4H1SkTZoB04y0A.jpg", "actors": ["Charles Brauer (Gustav Iller)", "Hans Trinkaus (Willi Schelp)", "Harry Hindemith (Paul Iller)", "Hedda Sarnow (Grete Iller)", "Walter Bluhm (Karl \"Kalle\" Roper)", "Hans Leibelt (Herr Eckmann, artist)", "Paul Bildt (Birke)", "Magdalene von Nu\u00dfbaum (Frau Schelp)", "Siegfried Utecht (Kapit\u00e4n)", "Fritz Rasp (Waldemar Hunke)", "Lotte Loebinger (Frau Steidel)", "Gerhard Haselbach (Steidel, the shell-shocked ex-soldier)", "Lilli Schoenborn ()", "Gaston Briese ()", "Karl Hannemann ()", "Eduard Wenck ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
