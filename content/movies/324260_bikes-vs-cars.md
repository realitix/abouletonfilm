An ever-growing, dirty, noisy traffic chaos. The bike is a great tool for change, but the powerful interests who gain from the private car invest billions each year on lobbying and advertising to protect their business. In the film we meet activists and thinkers who are fighting for better cities, who refuse to stop riding despite the increasing number killed in traffic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8KEZ7cn2VlJy9Lz3uIFImFJ5H9S.jpg", "actors": ["Aline Cavalcante (Interviewpartner)", "Dan Koeppel (Interviewpartner)", "Raquel Rolnik (Interviewpartner)", "Joel Ewanick (Interviewpartner)", "Ivan Naurholm (Interviewpartner)", "Nicolas Habib (Interviewpartner)", "Don Ward (Interviewpartner)", "Gil Pe\u00f1alosa (Interviewpartner)", "Liliana Godoy (Interviewpartner)", "Christina Deckwirth (Interviewpartner)", "Joshua Dysart (Interviewpartner)", "Denzil Minnan-Wong (Interviewpartner)", "Fabio Mendon\u00e7a (Interviewpartner)", "Evelyn Araripe (Interviewpartner)", "Otto Koeppel (Dans neugeborener Sohn)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [407897, 252485, 368836, 404490], "youtube_key": "zPqF1BCkIw8"}
