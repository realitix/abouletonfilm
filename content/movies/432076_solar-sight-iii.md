Scenes are sometimes run-on, sometimes separated by brief periods of darkness to relax, as in breathing, the viewing eye. There are no fancy superimpositions now, nor excessive visual trickery, only a comparatively straight forward presentation of the improbable images, which have formed themselves in my improbable mind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9g8w0BoETkzmvAVzbkWR54YR8Wu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
