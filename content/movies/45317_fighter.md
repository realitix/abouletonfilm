C\u2019\u00e9tait avant qu\u2019il ne sombre dans la drogue, avant son s\u00e9jour en prison.Entre le sportif en qu\u00eate d\u2019un second souffle et l\u2019ex-toxico, il y a longtemps que le courant ne passe plus. Trop de non-dits, d\u2019\u00e9checs et de souffrances. Pourtant, parfois, les hommes changent, et Micky et Dicky vont peut-\u00eatre avoir ensemble, la chance de r\u00e9ussir ce qu\u2019ils ont rat\u00e9 chacun de leur c\u00f4t\u00e9\u2026", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ddoP1dqYCzw89Tno6UfYleetf5o.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Wahlberg (Micky Ward)", "Christian Bale (Dick \"Dicky\" Eklund)", "Amy Adams (Charlene Fleming)", "Melissa Leo (Alice Eklund-Ward)", "Mickey O'Keefe (Himself)", "Dendrie Taylor (Gail 'Red Dog' Eckland Carney)", "Jack McGee (George Ward)", "Bianca Hunter (Cathy \"Pork\" Eklund)", "Erica McDermott (Cindy \"Tar\" Eklund)", "Jenna Lamia (Sherri \"The Baby\" Ward)", "Caitlin Dwyer (Kasie Ward)", "Chanty Sok (Karen)", "Jackson Nicoll (Little Dickie)", "Frank Renzulli (Sal Lanano)", "Sugar Ray Leonard (Himself)", "Melissa McMeekin ('Little Alice' Eklund)", "Ted Arcidi (Lou Gold)", "Ross Bickell (Mike Toma)", "Sean Malone (Wolfie)", "Matthew Muzio (HBO Cameraman)", "Alison Folland (Laurie Carroll)", "Thomas Benton (Businessman)", "Jeremiah Kissel (Bald Businessman)", "Kim Carrell (Reporter)", "Dale Place (Referee Micky Vann)", "Bonnie Aarons (Crackhead Bonnie)", "Walter Driscoll (Court Officer)", "Jerrell Lee Wesley (Fight Spectator)", "Eric Weinstein (Micky's Friend)", "Anthony Molinari (Neary)", "Peter Cunningham (Mike 'Machine Gun' Mungin)", "Brian Christensen (Drunk Guy)", "Jen Weissenberg (Drunk Girl)", "Michael Buffer (Fight Announcer)", "Larry Merchant (Fight Announcer)", "Jim Lampley (Fight Announcer)", "Emanuel Steward (Fight Announcer)", "Roy Jones Jr. (Fight Announcer)", "George Foreman (Fight Announcer)", "Dicky Eklund Jr. (Man on Street #4)", "Charlie Alejandro (Movie Patron (uncredited))", "Joseph Basile (Inmate Prisoner (uncredited))", "Jeffrey Corazzini (Inmate (uncredited))", "Conan Marchi (Inmate (uncredited))", "Brina (Ringside Fan (uncredited))", "Luisa Diaz (Ring card girl (uncredited))", "Shawn Fogarty (Ringside Reporter / Gym Fight Spectator / Courtroom Attendee / Pedestrian / Precision Driver (uncredited))", "Jodie Brunelle (VIP Spectator (uncredited))", "John Franchi (VIP (uncredited))", "Gino Cafarelli (Lowell Neighbor (uncredited))", "Al Conti (Larry Merchant (uncredited))", "Shawn Doherty (Road Crew Co Worker (uncredited))", "Henry Penzi (Road Crew Co Worker (uncredited))", "Ger Duany (Extra (uncredited))", "Alex East (Fight Spectator (uncredited))", "Dan Marshall (Fight Spectator (uncredited))", "Jeff Martineau (Fight Spectator (uncredited))", "Anastasia Sanidopoulos Mousis (Fight Spectator (uncredited))", "Briggon Snow (Fight Spectator (uncredited))", "Thomas Olson (Fight Photographer (uncredited))", "Ron Shimshilashvili (Fight Fan (uncredited))", "Mark Falvo (Press (uncredited))", "Susan Farese (British Press Reporter (uncredited))", "Dennis Jay Funny (King, Ring Girl Escort (uncredited))", "London Hall (Casino Gambler (uncredited))", "Hunter Wilichoski (Casino Kid (uncredited))", "Kimko (Referee (uncredited))", "Dennis Lauricella (Boxing Referee (uncredited))", "David Struffolino (Boxing Ring Photographer (uncredited))", "Alicia Love (Background (uncredited))", "Joseph Oliveira (Spectator (uncredited))", "Joe Siriani (Bodyguard (uncredited))"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "Kenneth Axel Carlsson", "content": "Two brothers. Two fighters. One has had his time and his now a junkie - Dicky (Christian Bale), and the other is in the shape of his life, with his career ahead of him - Micky (Mark Wahlberg). The two love eachother, but one is on his way up, and the other is on his way down. Lets just say, it is not without problems. This is based on a true story, btw, and we see the two brothers by the credits (lovely idea, and also shows us how true the actors are to the real brothers).\r\n\r\nThe story is centered around Micky, but we also get a lot of insight into his crazy family, which consists of a mad and devoted mother (Melissa Leo), a hundred sisters and of course, the father who is just trying to survive in the ocean of women. They all mean well, but damn, I am glad my family is different from them. \r\n\r\nI've never (big word in this case, but still) been a big David O. Russell fan. His movies has been a little too... fancy for my liking, and with a weird sense of humor (seriously, I've never understood what why everyone liked Silver Linings Playbook). However, this one really took me by the heart and flipped me around. It is a very emotional story, and the fact that it's a true story, only makes it so much better. Also, the actors are great, especially the two brothers, Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale. They have enough contrasts between them to make it really interesting.\r\n\r\n_Last words... forget the boxing matches. They are ok, but its the story between the brothers that is the real story here. I mean... that last scene with the two being interviewed... that got me so bad. It is a predictable story, but really, I can forgive that, since the rest is so good._"}, {"pseudo": "Andres Gomez", "content": "A really good movie like you don't easily find lately.\r\n\r\nGreat story, without getting into getting cheesy and great cat.
