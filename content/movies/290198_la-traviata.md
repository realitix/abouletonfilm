The outdoor setting is stunning\u2013it is a massive Roman quarry with mountains visible in the near and far distance\u2013and apparently this Traviata is the first opera they\u2019ve done without wild animals in residence (Nabucco, Aida, and Carmen have been shown in recent years). The sets are lavish enough to make Franco Zeffirelli blush. Designer Manfred Waba has placed the action in a reproduction of the Paris Opera, complete with stage boxes inhabited by patrons in their fanciest clothing who watch along with us. There is more gold than anyone would know what to do with.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f7jkgupKPjlyXPvQOpiEjdBVZ38.jpg", "actors": ["Kristiane Kaiser (Violetta Val\u00e9ry)", "Magdalena Anna Hofmann (Flora Bervoix)", "Stefanie Kopinits (Annina)", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Borras (Alfredo Germont)", "Georg Tichy (Giorgio Germont)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
