Destitute, the troupe plans to return home when Mac, the stage doorman, offers to allow four of the men, Phil, Dandy, Jack and Ted, to use the theater for a boardinghouse. After accepting Mac's offer, the men improvise bedrooms out of the set pieces and meet amateur actress Lorie Fenton from Cleveland, who is eager to audition for them. When the men learn she recently received a small inheritance, they allow her to audition, hoping she will back the show.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vHXR4VyFxnEDlEipYJBb0lf69LV.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Paige (Ted Brooks)", "Peter Lind Hayes (Dandy Joslyn)", "Eddie Quillan (Jack Norcross)", "Frank Jenks (Phil Miller)", "Grace McDonald (Lorie Fenton)", "Virginia Dale (Dolly Stewart)", "Carol Adams (Polly Adams)", "Lillian Cornell (Doris Marlowe)", "William Frawley (Mac)", "Charles Lane (Freeman Taylor)", "Wanda McKay (Lulu)", "Arthur Aylesworth (Joe Phillips)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
