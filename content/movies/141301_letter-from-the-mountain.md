They visit a thatched cottage that serves as a memorial shrine (amidado) for the village dead and chat with the attendant, the spry 96-year-old Oume (Tanie Kitabayashi). Together they admire the view -- from an inspiring distance. Oume, it turns out, is a kind of sage, whose thoughts and observations are a popular feature in a column in a local newsletter. Her amanuensis is a mute, sweetly smiling young woman named Sayuri (Manami Konishi), who is as devoted to Oume as Oume is to the souls of her beloved dead.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vY7KiU8S269XUZAbwUpLdXyPPvv.jpg", "actors": ["Akira Terao (Takao Ueda)", "Kanako Higuchi (Michiko Ueda)", "Hisashi Igawa (Sayuri's father)", "Tanie Kitabayashi (Oume)", "Manami Konishi (Sayuri)", "Yoko Shioya (Tanabe)", "Takahiro Tamura (Shigenaga Koda)", "Hidetaka Yoshioka (Dr. Nakamura)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "zlInf21k080"}
