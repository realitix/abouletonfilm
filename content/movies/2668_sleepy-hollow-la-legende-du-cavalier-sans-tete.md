Terrifi\u00e9s, les habitants sont persuad\u00e9s que ces meurtres sont commis par un \u00e9trange et furieux cavalier, dont la rumeur pr\u00e9tend qu'il est lui-m\u00eame sans t\u00eate. Les autorit\u00e9s new-yorkaises envoient alors leur plus fin limier pour \u00e9claircir ce myst\u00e8re. Ichabod Crane ne croit ni aux l\u00e9gendes, ni aux vengeances post-mortem.

I do not think Johnny Depp was the right person for playing Ichabod Crane. Maybe I am too influenced by seeing him in Pirates of The Caribbean but I just do not think he was the right person for this role. He really did not work for me. He is to whimsical and gesticulating to be taken seriously as a scientifically inclined crime investigator as far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nToo bad since the story itself and the movie was quite promising. As is often the case with Tim Burton\u2019s work the movie has quite dark tone which I quite like. The various scruffy and suspicious characters that Ichabod meets right away as he enters the village inn fits right into the eerie atmosphere.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Ichabod\u2019s inclination for science clashes with the rest of the story which is undoubtedly supernatural. It makes the movie not really have a distinct direction but instead waddle with one foot in each camp. I would have preferred if the movie either had gone all science and in the end Ichabod had exposed an evil but perfectly human adversary by scientific means or if it had gone all supernatural and Ichabod was an adept at exposing (exorcising) supernatural beings rather than a scientist.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, the movie was still a decent enough evening flick and fairly enjoyable. The footage and scenery are well done as one would expect from Tim Burton. It is not exactly a special effects loaded movie but what is there is fairly okay, at least for a movie from 1999."}], "recommandations_id": [13885, 768, 628, 622]}
