Reuniting in 2003 with Fleetwood Mac, Buckingham and his former cohorts released Say You Will and embarked on a worldwide tour. With this Soundstage appearance, Buckingham\u2019s performance spans the various eras of his career. Whether performing Rumours hits \u201cRed Rover\u201d and \u201cPeacekeeper\u201d from Say You Will, or 1981\u2019s Law and Order single \u201cTrouble\u201d and the title song from Go Insane, As an added bonus, the alluring Stevie Nicks joins Buckingham during the set, providing an intimate view of the chemistry that once propelled their former band to the top of the charts. Though their once tumultuous relationship was a topic that reached near-epic proportions, this reunion eclipses the controversy, placing all emotion back into the songs that defined them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/acy7NwdvLJF9FhXJ3Foe00Z10i0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
