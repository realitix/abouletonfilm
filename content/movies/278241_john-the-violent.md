The murderer is Ioannis Zachos (Manos Logiadis), a young man lacking in both mental and sexual stability, who lives out his erotic fantasies through purifying violence. He often fantasizes about killing beautiful women, in this way compensating for his deficient manhood and satisfying his passion for power. When he is arrested, he immediately confesses his crimes, which is a relief to the police, who have been accused of gross ineptitude by the press. During the trial that follows, the relentless question, \u201cwho is ultimately guilty? Man or society?\u201d is again raised.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jkbk7BB11BhH5xb96qFBcPI5hNa.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
