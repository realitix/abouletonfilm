Erin Gray turns in a commanding, award-worthy\r performance with a portrayal that is disarming in its reality. Kent McCord portrays a man in\r profound conflict, reflecting the best and worst in all of us. Gary Conway's performance as\r artist/attorney, David Merritt, will invoke people to question their own unchallenged truths.\r Marshall Borden brings depth, style and humanity to his role of the inspired playwright.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
