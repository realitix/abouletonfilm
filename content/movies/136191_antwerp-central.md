The film covers three centuries of Belgian railway history: from the moment that the national railway company laid its first tracks to the development of the high-speed rail link in the  21st century. Echoes of Belgium\u2019s colonial past and the location of the station in the centre of the bustling diamond district and next to the city zoo add a surreal touch as contrasting pairs, such as animal and human, nature and industry, baroque and modernity, dilapidation and renovation are complexly juxtaposed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hSkebePaXlbGCnmrKkGwbClOEO4.jpg", "actors": ["Thessa Kr\u00fcger (The Little Girl)", "Johan Leysen (The Traveller)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
