Whether following at close range the semi-circular motion of a handsome, pacing leopard, its spots evoking rhythmic patterns through Fanderl's intuitive shooting process, or closely studying a tray of glassware on a ship as the sea reflects and refracts through the crystalline shapes, the artist fully gives herself over to the present moment and allows us to bask in it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2eaCDrC9f0p7VFGy2jennBrgU6v.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
