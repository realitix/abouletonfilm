I wish that the films of today could have\r\neven a fraction of its good-natured mischievous approach. Certainly film studios could learn a thing or two, in this ridiculous era of quarter-of-a-billion-dollar blockbusters. I for one don't need the equivalent of 'having my eyes masturbated', as one cinema critic so lovingly stated.\r\n\r\nI would prefer watching this in a second over any of the ham-fisted,\r\ncash-soaked holiday atrocities made in the past three decades (I\r\nbelieve 'A Christmas Story', and perhaps 'Elf' and 'National Lampoon's\r\nChristmas Vacation' to be the last decently-made Yuletide films).\r\n\r\nBut don't take MY word for it...see it for yourself (without the stupid\r\nand condescending MST3K commentary) and make your OWN conclusion."}], "recommandations_id": [31119, 49379, 31122, 22727]}
