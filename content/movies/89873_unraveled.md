Brazen forgeries and impersonations branded the white collar crime spree remarkable. \"Unraveled\" is set in the purgatory of house arrest -- an Upper East Side penthouse -- where the Court has ordered Dreier confined until his sentencing day. The film weaves Dreier's struggle to prepare for the possibility of life imprisonment with first-person flashbacks, which reveal his audacious path of destruction. Destroyed by his own hubris, Dreier attempts to grasp his tragic unraveling. With unprecedented access, \"Unraveled\" exposes a mastermind of criminal deception.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Adm3NLGZBP4AnyiWo1KsCHWiZrR.jpg", "actors": ["Marc Dreier (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [120777], "youtube_key": "QTLm5I-bHsI"}
