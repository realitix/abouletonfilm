This short was reissued in June of 1950 to be shown as a trailer with 1950's \"Father of the Bride\" and some sources think this short was made for that express purpose and date it as a 1950 film.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["William Newell (Groom-to-be (uncredited))", "Sally Payne (Bride-to-be (uncredited))", "Pete Smith (Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
