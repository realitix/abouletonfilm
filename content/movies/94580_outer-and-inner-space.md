On the videotape, Edie is positioned on the left side of the frame, facing right; she is talking to an unseen person off-screen to our right. In the film, the \u201creal\u201d or \u201clive\u201d Edie Sedgwick is seated on the right side of the film frame, with her video image behind her, and she is talking to an unseen person off-screen to our left. The effect of this setup is that it sometimes creates the rather strange illusion that we are watching Edie in conversation with her own video image.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/33O5NweS4M5yYtHFc6pIMTi3B2Y.jpg", "actors": ["Edie Sedgwick (Edie Sedgwick)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [83909, 350062, 39239, 350068], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
