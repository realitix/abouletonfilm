{"tmdb_id": 489474, "title": "The MeshugaNutcracker", "original_title": "The MeshugaNutcracker", "slug_title": "the-meshuganutcracker", "date": "", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "The MeshugaNutcracker! is a full-length musical comedy that features the wonderfully silly sensibilities of the folklore of Chelm (the fictional town of fools) underscored by an invigorating, Klezmer-ized orchestration of Tchaikovsky's \"Nutcracker Suite\", now with original lyrics that celebrate Chanukah. Judah Maccabee's triumphant saga and accounts of perseverance during the Holocaust as well as the celebration of the first Chanukah in the new state of Israel emerge with a genuine sense of wonder as the Chelmniks tell eight stories that pay tribute to the holiday. Add in dancing dreidels, singing sufganiot, and surprise guest stars and you have the perfect recipe for a holiday gathering. Some might call it crazy...we call it The MeshugaNutcracker!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lYcwvTMXwhRT1rOio3lwyBtKBab.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
