The rich history and doctrine were illustrated and reviewed beautifully. Some of the explanations of tulip were new to me and I found their depth to be refreshing. While I personally loved the call for racial justice at the end of the film, it felt somewhat out of place and probably could back been transitioned into more seamlessly."}], "recommandations_id": []}
