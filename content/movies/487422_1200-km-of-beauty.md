The film is a trip to the peninsula made especially with the documents of the Istituto Luce, in whose archives appears an Italy from the early twentieth century, a long journey up to years close to ours. An articulated Italy, made up of different forms of Beauty, in a territory that has particular characteristics for each region, from Valle d'Aosta and Friuli Venezia Giulia, from Tuscany to Lazio, from Lombardy to Liguria, from Campania to Sicily and its islands; and so on. Twenty regions. The history of the territory, of the its landscape, life of its people and art have always been mixed. The spectacle of nature intertwines with the spectacle of Italian work and creativity, open to the world, loved and visited by the world. The film tells this Italy. Scenarios, art, work, landscapes, culture, shows, great people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r65akqxfSGArSXExxVrhr7qXVfo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
