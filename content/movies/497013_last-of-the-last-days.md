The director\u2019s decision to leave the family\u2019s faith results in an ultimatum from her mother, a devout Jehovah\u2019s Witness: either return to Jehovah or never see her again. As the choices are revealed, the film discovers what has been lost and questions why subsequent generations often repeat the past.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nqeiXr5mLtyr0WGmCeLZEbvsX9Z.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
