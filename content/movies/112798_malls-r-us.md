The film blends archival footage tracing the history of the shopping mall in America, visits to some of the world's largest and most spectacular malls-in Canada, the U.S., the U.K., Japan, Poland, France, and Dubai-and interviews with architects, mall developers, sales managers, environmentalists, labor activists and social critics, as well as commentary from mall shoppers themselves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/70U8IWOxbmjvWtYKTVX1iyGGhvo.jpg", "actors": ["Jon Pahl (Himself)", "Rubin Stahl (Himself)", "Alfred Taubman (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "C6m0KwBzOpU"}
