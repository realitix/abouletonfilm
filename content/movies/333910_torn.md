The men in the cast become a part of the wallpaper, but the setting in Florida is great. There are lots of juggling boobs and simulated sex, in warm and partly wet environments. Kate, played by Amanda is a writer with writer\u2019s block, and goes with boyfriend and two other couples to Florida to visit a friend living on the waterfront. One of the other two girls is having an affair with Kate\u2019s boyfriend. The mood of the movie is set in the jacuzzi and on the sunny beach. Nice couples touch to the movie, which is definitely softcore. These girls must have been in Playboy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/87fdLNvoD4siNK6mgwo0KaGW4Y5.jpg", "actors": ["Amanda Collins ()", "Sven Garrett ()", "Hardy-Ames Hill ()", "Mary Milligton ()", "Anka Romensky ()", "Chantell Thomas ()", "John Trapani ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
