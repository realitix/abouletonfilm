In the summer of 2005, he and a group of young college students traveled across the country in a wheelchair-accessible RV to test accessibility in the United States. Their ultimate goal was to reach Los Angeles and convince MTV's hit show, \"Pimp My Ride,\" to customize Darius's wheelchair. Along the way, they found joy, brotherhood, and the knowledge that life, even when imperfect, is always worth the ride.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1E5SunsLXef7lGux9UVvqTwVp8O.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Jackson (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
