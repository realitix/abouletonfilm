Written by Kaneto Shind\u00f4 and featuring Ry\u00f4 Ikebe as a young policeman it is part crime drama, part social study. Definitely not an undiscovered masterpiece, but still a must for Ichikawa buffs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zrHaITnHpyVPHv2WuHe6pHdYYlr.jpg", "actors": ["Ry\u00f4 Ikebe ()", "Jun Tazaki ()", "Michitar\u00f4 Mizushima ()", "Y\u00f4ko Sugi ()", "Y\u016bnosuke It\u014d ()", "Kan Yanagiya ()", "Fujio Nagahama ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
