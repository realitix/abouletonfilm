Ephron comes vibrantly alive onscreen via her words; the memories of her sisters, colleagues, former spouses, and many friends; scenes from her movies; and, above all, her own inimitable presence. Watch any given moment of Ephron being her sparkling but caustically witty self (for instance, this response to a scolding talk show host\u2014\"You have a soft spot for Julie Nixon, don't you. See, I don't...\") and you find it hard to believe that she\u2019s been gone from our midst for three years. Everything Is Copy (Ephron's motto, inherited from her mother) is a lovingly drawn but frank portrait and, incidentally, a vivid snapshot of an earlier, livelier, bitchier, and funnier moment in New York culture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9QslFCPfSRXtNwONVsDDvlzN1fp.jpg", "actors": ["Nora Ephron ()", "Tom Hanks ()", "Rob Reiner ()", "Mike Nichols ()", "Lena Dunham ()", "Reese Witherspoon ()", "Meryl Streep ()", "Rita Wilson ()", "Gaby Hoffmann ()", "Steven Spielberg ()", "Meg Ryan ()", "Kate Capshaw ()", "Bob Balaban ()", "Rosie O'Donnell ()", "Joel Schumacher ()", "Amy Pascal ()", "Barbara Walters ()", "David Geffen ()", "Carl Bernstein ()", "Barry Diller ()", "Delia Ephron ()", "George C.
