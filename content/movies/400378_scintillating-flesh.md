Each stroke of light unveils an image and permits it to spill over to the adjacent film frames, thus breaking out of its rectangular prison while at the same time being woven into the fluidity of moving body, the whiteness of light, and the redness of flesh. Using the photogram technique and my body as a tool and a means to inscribe myself into this film, \u201cScintillating Flesh\u201d is a self-inscription, where the filmmaker is not so much its subject but becomes its form.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5RTahVi0aTMf8pMCglbh2ADBAv0.jpg", "actors": ["Izabella Pruska-Oldenhof ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
