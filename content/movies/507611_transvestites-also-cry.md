In a small side street, seconds away from the Place the Clichy, two dirty and dingy hotels face one another. Behind their facades, the lives of marginal transsexuals from Ecuador take place. They all work as prostitutes in the Bois de Boulogne. Among them, we meet \"Mujeron\", (the \"Big Woman\", in Spanish), a former boxer who chose prostitution and a solitary life in order to survive and help his family back home. We also meet the exuberant and ironic \"Romina\", who seems to have made her dreams come true thanks to prostitution: a woman's body, a housewife's routine, a small flat and some money. Two parallel existences that are apparently poles apart but will in fact unite in one tragic ending. Both light-hearted and tragic, switching from flirtatiousness to misery, from optimism to fatalism, the story of Romina and Mia balances between joyful complicity and solitary distress.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ihtsVwiUrMZu1OGexBEFgmUZF5O.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
