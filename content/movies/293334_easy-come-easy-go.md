Becoming a bit overexcited on the air, our hero lets slip a few (fortuitously unheard) profanities. Fired from his job, Parker enters into an amusing series of misadventures with veteran bank robber Jim Bailey (Charles Sellon). Wide-eyed Nancy Carroll is delightful as ever as Dix's love interest. Easy Come, Easy Go was adapted from a play by the prolific Owen Davis Sr.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zsZzqMH4fOxL4hEZTvsGJTXpYPz.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Dix (Robert Parker)", "Nancy Carroll (Barbara Quayle)", "Charles Sellon (Jim Bailey)", "Frank Currier (Mr. Quayle)", "Arnold Kent (Winthrop)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
