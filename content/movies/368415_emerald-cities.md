Juxtapositions of \"on-the street\" interviews (by Willie Boy Walker), punk performances by bands Flipper and The Mutants, TV shows of past-life hypnotism and nuclear destruction, and a crazed ex-con all finally intermix with the characters' own sagas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i6It3sxF6tKCGkvgprFoqgOF6Y4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
