His contribution as an interdisciplinary composer, educator, and founding member of Western Front, though undoubtedly extensive, is in danger of being erased from cultural memory since his death from AIDS in 1993.  Navigating an array of archival materials including letters, correspondences, notebooks, personal photos, and a huge body of unreleased music and field recordings held at the archives of Simon Fraser University, Electro-Pythagoras is a journey through the evolution of Bartlett\u2019s musical time and space, softly guided by Luke Fowler\u2019s insightful camera and montage\u2014creating an experimental portrait that defies one-dimensionality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hbkFUBza3fgbpHVv9GIQs31yfkD.jpg", "actors": ["Martin Bartlett (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
