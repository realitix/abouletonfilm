He sets out for Scotland's Isle of Skye, where he will burn down the star's mansion. In a cafe, he meets Vincente (Jonny Philips), a Spaniard who asks him for a ride. With his new friend in tow, Charlie soldiers on, only to run out of gas in the middle of nowhere. They walk to the nearest residence--where they are greeted by a suspicious and motley group of people who may or may not be part of a bizarre cult that lives in the area. Charlie and Vincente will be staying longer then they expected, and it is going to be a strange visit! David Mackenzie's (YOUNG ADAM) first film is an offbeat hybrid of horror and comedy with an effective score by the Pastels.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g5Au3A79NaOukjyZMV73fNssZay.jpg", "actors": ["Alastair Mackenzie (Charlie)", "Jonny Phillips (Vincente)", "Ewan Stewart (Magnus)", "David Hayman (Ruaridh)", "Victoria Smurfit (Claire)", "Louise Irwin (Morag)", "Jane Stenson (Flora)", "John Comerford (Paul)", "Sheila Donald (Ellie)", "Gerard Horan (Contract Killer)", "William Harrison (Contract Killer)", "Ford Kiernan (Eric)", "Martin Bell (William)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
