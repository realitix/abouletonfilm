This experimental satire that examines what happens when a South Korean filmmaker sojourns into communist North Korea to breathe new life into that country's flagging, propaganda-driven movie industry. Believing that cinema can prop up North Korea's Juche Idea of self-reliance, mad dictator Kim Jong-Il pulls out all the stops to help the young \u00e9migr\u00e9 produce appropriate films.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bxEPrjcXgrjcFRxnbLfkMg8BKg.jpg", "actors": ["Jung Yoon Lee (Yoon Jung)", "Daniela Kostova (Russian Woman)", "Sung Kim (North Korean Man)", "Oleg Mavromatti (Russian Man)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
