It does have it's share of logical loopholes but still entertaining for sure.\r\n\r\nJohn Travolta takes up the biggest space on the poster but that is merely due to the fact that he's the most famous person in it, his role is important but there are at least 5 people with more screen-time than him.\r\n\r\nMichael Pitt is what drew me to this movie the most but I must say that Dan Stevens and Edi Gathegi outshone him in this.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a dark comedy about some not so brilliant criminals you could do alot worse than this."}], "recommandations_id": [332411, 301608, 354110, 255157]}
