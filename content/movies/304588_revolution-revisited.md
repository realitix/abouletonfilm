Its also a struggle of ordinary people, unlettered in combat, politics and government. Al Pacino stars as a rough-hewn trapper drawn into the conflict in this compelling adventure framed by the violent summer of 1776 and the bloody victory of Yorktown in 1781.  This is the director's \"reimagined new version\" of his 1985 film, which is 10 minutes shorter than the original, among other changes.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
