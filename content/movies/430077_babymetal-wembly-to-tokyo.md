The biggest cultural export from Japan in recent years has been the phenomenal rise of Babymetal; 3 school age girls fusing Metal with J-Pop, who recently performed a sold out concert in front of 12,000 fans at Wembley Arena.  Dev heads to Tokyo to learn more about the pop-culture that\u2019s spawned the band. He enters the world of traditional J-Pop idols (including Katy Perry endorsed Kyary Pamyu Pamyu), explores the Japanese rock scene (with Crossfaith), learns about kawaii fashion in Harajuku (Tokyo\u2019s equivalent to Camden Market) and has a wild karaoke night with a band called Ladybaby.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aUu3QHzqLzalGzkIdRW6drZCVex.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
