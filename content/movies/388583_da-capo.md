Literally sold to a master teacher, Sergei Rippas (Tarmo Manni) by his mother when he was still a child, the violin prodigy was forcefully and strictly raised to practice, practice, and perfect his technique. Once an adult, Arsi finds a way to escape the rigors of a U.S. tour and drowns his overworked self in drink, or seeks out one-night stands, or otherwise lets off steam. The tightly-wound spring that has been coiled since he was forced into his grueling training and work sessions -- shown through symbolic images -- eventually snaps in a healthy way, freeing Arsi at last to continue on, simply for the love of music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9hDXykMmwMpcX4FmyogUiotTFPg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
