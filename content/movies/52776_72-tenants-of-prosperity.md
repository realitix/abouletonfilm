Now they run competing phone stores right across from each other on Mongkok's busiest street, and stretch their minds trying to outdo each other with crazy promotions. There's absolutely no mixing with the enemy in these parts - until Kung and Kin's kids fall for each other! Further chaos breaks out when the landlord triples the rent of all the shop owners to force them out for redevelopment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vyyLh18vD6lJR9FIKfpr2A3HXlN.jpg", "actors": ["Jacky Cheung (Shek Kin)", "Eric Tsang (Ha Kung)", "Anita Yuen (Pinky)", "Bosco Wong (Ha Chai)", "Stephy Tang (Kin Nui)", "Linda Chung (Ha Nui)", "Wong Cho-lam (Kinny, Shek Kin's son)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [57880], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
