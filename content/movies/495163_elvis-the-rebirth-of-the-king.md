He became, in those short years, the greatest performer on earth. The film tracks this five-year renaissance with some of his key musical and artistic collaborators of the period, including the creator of his most memorable jumpsuits, to celebrate the greatest pop reinvention of all time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ic6gMsnLFY52MRWQNMGL921o3me.jpg", "actors": ["Elvis Presley (Performance)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
