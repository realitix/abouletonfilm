But here he portrays the great Chih Shim, the monk who saved the Southern Shaolin Temple. Making this production all the more notable is Lo Lieh, Shaws' first international star, who returns to a role he also made famous - that of Shaolin renegade Pai Mei. This, and even more, makes for a true martial arts epic of the first order.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uiLPIZJCUjytmHNou3aF0iZAWll.jpg", "actors": ["David Chiang (Monk Chi San)", "Lo Lieh (Pai Mei)", "Cheng Miu (Mr. Li)", "Ku Kuan-Chung (Tao Te)", "Lily Li Li-Li (Wu Mei)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [107897, 108510, 88978, 75843], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
