Some people think the animation is weak, but I feel it creates its own world and has its own charm. It holds up as long as you can adapt to those creepy dead eyes of the characters.\r\n\r\nSome people love this movie while others think it\u2019s weird, like a Twilight Zone Christmas flick. Roger Ebert, for instance, loved it and gave it a perfect grade. I\u2019m sorta in the middle. I see its good points and appreciate them, like the haunting winter ambiance, parts of the trip to the North Pole (e.g. the quasi-rollercoaster ride) and the kids\u2019 investigation of the Christmas factory. But there are some meh parts and dubious sections like the whole last act with the multitude of elves and the towering Santa who looked like he was modeled after 6\u20195\u201d Christopher Lee with a pillow strapped to his mid-section.\r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s interesting in some ways but also quaint in a cheesy way, as well as peculiar and lifeless.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C"}], "recommandations_id": [9836, 10555, 9928, 9982]}
