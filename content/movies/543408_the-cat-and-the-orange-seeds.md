Yet the wife stays in the marriage to take care of him daily. The film is full of beautiful shots which sadden the couple\u2019s distress even more as it evokes a lovely past that was not so further away but will forever stay as memory. Sadness initiates beautiful dream that soon turns to wishful thinking and breaks into despair. The story of The Cat and the Orange Seeds is not a new one yet the way it is done, it is a tragedy beautifully told with pure cinematic beauty and capable of truly touching tour heart.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c13mwV0DI5eyzFaLTyspnmrJHmz.jpg", "actors": ["Cuong Dang Cao (The Husband)", "Trang Nguyen Mai (The Wife)", "Tu Nguyen Duc (The Friend)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
