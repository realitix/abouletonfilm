This new system manipulates the environment in a way which can: * Disrupt human mental processes. * Jam all global communications systems. * Change weather patterns over large areas. * Interfere with wildlife migration patterns. * Negatively affect your health. * Unnaturally impact the Earth's upper atmosphere. The U.S. military calls its zapper HAARP (High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program). But this sky buster is not about the Northern Lights. The device will turn on lights never intended to be artificially manipulated.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tJD1TwZ740q3hUkUf2I1klQ0thr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
