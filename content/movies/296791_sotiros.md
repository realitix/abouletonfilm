Filmed in Athens and Peloponnesus in Greece as well as in Austria, much of Sotiros is structured around another binarism: two repeating intertitles marked \"He said\" and \"he said.\" Each title introduces a set of visual phrases with loosely parallel camerawork. The images are careful and delicate studies of light patterns in a hotel suite and at a cafe, rolling hills populated by a lone shepherd, Eurostyle modernized storefronts, a blind man begging in the street. The film\u2019s title refers to one of the appellations of the Apollo, in his role as savior or healer. - New York Press", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ajc7BuLkMxNFpv5iafNvUEV9XLa.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
