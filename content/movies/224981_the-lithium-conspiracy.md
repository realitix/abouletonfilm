And the power of governments behind the events has been replaced by the power of holding companies. Nowadays you don't conquer a country. You buy it. \"Short story of long betrayals\" is again set in the Republic of Queimada, where in the \"Salar de Queimada\" (a salt lake) lies 50% of lithium in the whole world. Not surprisingly, there is an international interest in its fate and a breathless fight to seize it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AbkaUPL45vHwdSQ8LaK8E7XgVFG.jpg", "actors": ["Carolina Crescentini (Cecilia)", "Maya Sansa (Valeria)", "Flora Mart\u00ednez (Mabel)", "Anna Ammirati (Adetta stampa)", "Guido Caprino (Giulio)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
