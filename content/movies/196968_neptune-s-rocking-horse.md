As an angry black cross-dresser is brutally beaten in an altercation with New York City police, five people look on at the incident. Busy businesswoman Genna (Laura Kenyon) thinks little of it, and she considers transvestitism to be a sexist parody of women. Woronoff (Joe Capozzi) is a gay rights activist who is appalled by the attack, even though he's unaware of the facts. Sadie (Helen Gallager) is an elderly woman caring for her invalid husband, but she finds this attack on a stranger hard to ignore. Malcolm (Tony Fair), a doorman at the building where the man was attacked, regards the victim as a disgrace to the black community, without examining his own place in African-American culture.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
