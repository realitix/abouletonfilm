Just weeks before the Olympics on Jan. 6, 1994 at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, Kerrigan was stunningly clubbed on the right knee by an unknown assailant and left wailing, \"Why, why, why?\" As the bizarre \"why\" mystery unraveled, it was revealed that Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, had plotted the attack with his misfit friends to literally eliminate Kerrigan from the competition. Now two decades later, THE PRICE OF GOLD takes a fresh look through Harding's turbulent career and life at the spectacle that elevated the popularity of professional figure skating and has Harding still facing questions over what she knew and when she knew it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sYbc74tb2r9JWXCOszqsjzHlFih.jpg", "actors": ["Tonya Harding (Herself)", "Nancy Kerrigan (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
