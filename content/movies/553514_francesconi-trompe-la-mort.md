An ambivalent character, both regal in bearing and warmly protective, cruel and yet loving, rapacious and indomitable even in the face of madness, this \u2019Machiavelli among miscreants\u2019 destined to become chief of police, uses his conquests to advance relentlessly in the pursuit of his aims whilst keeping his hand closely hidden. Guy Cassiers, working for the first time with the Paris Opera, portrays a three-tiered society where some rise and others fall.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/93HmhQoknL2Zezob9En31IHktsG.jpg", "actors": ["Laurent Naouri (Vautrin / Trompe-la-mort / Jacques Collin)", "Julie Fuchs (Esther)", "Cyrille Dubois (Lucien de Rubempr\u00e9)", "Marc Labonnette (Le Baron de Nucingen)", "Ildik\u00f3 Koml\u00f3si (Asie)", "Philippe Talbot (Eug\u00e8ne de Rastignac)", "Susanna M\u00e4lkki (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
