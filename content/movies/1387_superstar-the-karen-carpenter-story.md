The first film from Todd Haynes (Velvet Goldmine, I'm Not There), Superstar is a hauntingly beautiful biopic that garnered immediate praise among the local film community but quickly received 2 cease-and-desist letters from Mattel, the maker of Barbie, and Karen Carpenter's family. To this day, this movie has not seen further release.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1JYPLVtOrkYNKplhrYrn0OETzM6.jpg", "actors": ["Merrill Gruver (Karen (voice))", "Michael Edwards (Richard (voice))", "Melissa Brown (Mother (voice))", "Rob LaBelle (Dad / Mr. A&M (voice))", "Cynthia Schneider (Dionne Warwick (voice))", "Todd Haynes ()", "Bruce Tuthill (Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [46784, 94513, 183913, 250252], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
