The union results in her being pegged as a household ornament for her husband by her husband's coworker. She makes friends with a woman who shows her how to juggle the couple's living expenses to get whatever material goods she desires. When the couple entertains the coworker and his wife, the drunken men suggests they swap wives. Celine strips the man and makes him look at himself in a mirror to prove he is not desirable. Celine turns to painting and writes papers on the inequity between genders as she asserts her independence and gradually frees herself from her husband's claustrophobic world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q5PFYOpt0FFiuUdTLZNtLl4JEow.jpg", "actors": ["Bernadette Lafont ()", "Bulle Ogier ()", "Michel Duchaussoy ()", "Serge Marquand ()", "Virginie Th\u00e9venet ()", "Mich\u00e8le Moretti ()", "Bernard Lajarrige ()", "Fran\u00e7oise Lugagne ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
