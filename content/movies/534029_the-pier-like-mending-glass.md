The old man\u2019s speech becomes more confused; the women of his family repeat the story, now become mythical, using re-speaking techniques inspired by \u201cverbatim theater\u201d; the filmmaker reconstructs the scene, casting a young woman whose blonde chignon brings to mind Vertigo\u2019s Madeleine. Yet the moment comes when the grandfather has to be brought to a nursing home, where, gradually, he fades away. His mind, his breathing, fly away with the passing time, along the flowing water. The last image that stays with him, is that of the pier\u2026", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
