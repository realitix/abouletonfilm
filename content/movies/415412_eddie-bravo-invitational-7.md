This time around, it's the featherweights turn to take center stage.  This seventh edition of the Eddie Bravo Invitational will be crowning the promotion\u2019s featherweight (145lbs / 65kg) division champion, a title currently held by Eddie Cummings.  Although the open weight tournament (EBI 6) included big names of jiu jitsu\u2019s international circuit, this featherweight event will have the popular tournament return to its origins in a recipe that rose the attention of the sport\u2019s fans in previous showings, a mix of veteran grapplers, fairly unknown talent and rising stars of the submission only movement.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vuMbthrgonNpzkJoxQdAu3jW0dV.jpg", "actors": ["Eddie Cummings (Himself)", "Geo Martinez (Himself)", "Joe Soto (Himself)", "Kim Terra (Himself)", "Rafael Domingos (Himself)", "Denny Prokopos (Himself)", "Mike Davila (Himself)", "Mike Main (Himself)", "Joao Alfredo Tavares (Himself)", "Baret Yoshida (Himself)", "Aza Muradyan (Himself)", "Sergio Hernandez (Himself)", "Ashley Wiliams (Himself)", "Jose De Jesus Gutierrez (Himself)", "Bill Cooper (Himself)", "Alex Ecklin (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "auKCN2_Fy2o"}
