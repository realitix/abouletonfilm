Malins during the First World War, is brilliantly decoded in this riveting experimental doc that unravels fascinating secrets and manipulations. A compelling contemplation of the ownership of history plays out on intertitles taken from excerpts of Malins\u2019s controversial autobiography juxtaposed with conflicting historical accounts and emotionally devastating clips from the original film. Dispatched to the front as Britain\u2019s \u201cOfficial Kinematographer,\u201d Malins filmed from the muddy trenches to capture the valour and horror of \u201cthe big push\u201d on July 1, 1916\u2014a day that has become synonymous with the futility of war. The British alone suffered 58,000 casualties by nightfall. The rising tension in this fascinating deconstruction of propaganda, illusion, and \u201ctruth\u201d in documentary is underscored by a haunting electro-ambient soundscape.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Oz74mddIV0g"}
