An alternative title, \u201cThe Scissors Bird,\u201d is intended as a reference to \u201cThe Story of Little Suck-aThumb\u201d in Hoffman\u2019s Struwwelpeter, in which little Conrad has his thumbs cut off. The clearest issue from the stormy advance of family history over the last two decades is that adult perceptions of children are unanchored and self-absorbed. By killing the imaginary child, Run Dick, Run Jane skews the adult viewer\u2019s inner child narrative investment. \u2014Tony Conrad", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
