As a privileged tenant, director Josef Birdman Astor began to videotape his neighbors whose lives intersected with decades of artistic history, but his project changed when the landlord served everyone with eviction notices for a conversion to offices. Astor chronicles the protracted battle to save the apartments and pays homage to their rich heritage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/shEeRpRRebxOuzHTFtStQnC5G5j.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
