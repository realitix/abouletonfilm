The working dog is locked inside a large wire wheel; the dog runs inside the wheel, turning it to run a machine. The beggar's dog pulls its legless master, who's sitting on a low cart, down the street. The shepherd's dog keeps a flock of at least 20 sheep in a tight circle. The milkman's dog pulls a cart on which is mounted a large cylinder of milk. A lad leads the dog to a house with a Dutch door; the top half of the door opens, and the lady of the house hands out a pitcher that the boy fills as the dog waits.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y02ADcADIHLUjPIBeGO35gXQ9bX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [163090, 152456, 189807, 163320], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
