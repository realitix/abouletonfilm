A marital crisis becomes a family tragedy; a mad man's gun forces a young couple to reconsider a premature pregnancy; a long struggle of in-vitro fertilizations brings together and forces apart two sterile women who have shared the same man; and a young Iraqi immigrant, all alone in her apartment, is forced to give birth to her child with the help of her Greek stalker and next door neighbor. The stories unfold within a day and collide in a violent and fatal incident.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b2hLRLBbpihNolwCfc8fmyP3WkJ.jpg", "actors": ["Kika Georgiou (Nadine)", "Giorgos Ziovas (Antonis)", "Vassilis Bisbikis (Fotis)", "Anna Kalaitzidou (Dina)", "Iosif Polyzoidis (Nadine's Neighbor)", "Dimitris Kotzias (Tasos)", "Natalia Kalimeratzi (Liza)", "Maria Tsima (Vaso)", "Iro Loupi (Marina)", "Leonidas Kakouris (Spyros)", "Mihalis Sarantis (Giannis)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
