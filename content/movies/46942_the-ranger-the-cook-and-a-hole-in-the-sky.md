Other than that, this is a Wilderness Drama wherein a teen comes of age. It\u2019s fairly family friendly and only hints at the worldly temptation youths will eventually face. The beauty of the wilderness is emphasized with the corresponding arduous hiking, camping, forest work, relationships and so forth. It\u2019s a likable movie if this appeals to you and realistically low-key.  \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 34 minutes and was shot in British Columbia, Canada. WRITERS: Norman Maclean (book) and Robert Wayne (teleplay).  \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"}], "recommandations_id": []}
