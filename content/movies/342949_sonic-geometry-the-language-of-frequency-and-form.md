Here at the dawn of a new age, this sonic-geometric puzzle is finally nearing completion, revealing the building blocks of a language based on energy, frequency and form.  How will we use it? With whom will we be communicating? Now that we know the basics of this new language, maybe we are ready to begin the conversation.... again?  Please join us as we explore the synchronicities and connections between ancient places and people, as well as the roles that geometry and sound have played in revealing one of the greatest mysteries on Planet Earth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xEW4CifJUBf9GPNaGJppsE0LwQD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
