This videotape, produced for an exhibition held jointly at San Francisco's City Hall and its Museum of Modern Art, argues \u2014 against the show's theme and title, Public Disclosure: Secrets from the Street \u2014 that accounts of cultural life that omit the question of social power are mythical: The real \"secret\" is the obscured relation of economic and political domination exercised by one's own culture over the observed subculture. Or, as Rosler states in the tape's voiceover, \"The secret is that to know the meaning of a culture you must know the limits of meaning of your own.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iEsOU90ympXEbOO7TGcTLL1z3QY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
