Onna banch\u00f4, the first movie in the series, takes place in Shinjuku, Tokyo where rivaling youth gangs are constantly trying to one-up each other in toughness. An all-girl gang led by Mei (Meiko Kaji) gets involved in dangerous circles when Mei's boyfriend Michio (K\u00f4ji Wada), wants to join a powerful yakuza organization called Seiyu but inadvertently loses the gangsters' money in a fixed boxing match. Of course, Mei's gang is not going to leave him to the gangsters, especially when helped by an enigmatic and independent female biker called Ako (Akiko Wada).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9FnVLok9s5KWcrVPhd9H6e01Rwj.jpg", "actors": ["Akiko Wada (Ako)", "Meiko Kaji (Mei)", "Tatsuya Fuji (Katsuya)", "Y\u00f4sui Inoue ()", "Ken Sanders (Kerry Fujiyama)", "Hanako Tokachi (Hanako)", "K\u00f4ji Wada (Michio)", "Bunjaku Han (Yuriko)", "Goro Mutsumi (Hanada)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [64721, 55783, 64726, 138845], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
