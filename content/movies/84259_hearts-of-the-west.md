He leaves home to answer a writing correspondence course's ad for on-campus classes, only to discover that the school consists of a row of postboxes at an isolated Nevada train depot. On the run from the con men responsible, Lewis stumbles across \"real\" cowboys shooting a movie in the desert. The would-be writer soon finds himself instead acting in Westerns, for the rundown Tumbleweed Productions, in silent-era Hollywood.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tNOLQdXpqxhgDd7a0xQBvqCBHbe.jpg", "actors": ["Jeff Bridges (Lewis Tater)", "Alan Arkin (Bert Kessler)", "Blythe Danner (Miss Trout)", "Andy Griffith (Howard Pike)", "Alex Rocco (Earl)", "Richard B.
