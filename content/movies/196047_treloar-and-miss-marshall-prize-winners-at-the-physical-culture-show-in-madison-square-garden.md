Marshall continues with various feminine poses, reminiscent of classic Greek statuary, to accentuate her figure. Film cuts to Treloar posed on the bare stage without a pedestal. He wears brief leopard-skin trunks or short tunic, wrist bands, and Roman-looking laced sandals. His poses accentuate the muscular development of his upper body, particularly that of his arms, and include movements that make the muscles jump. Treloar finishes with a slight nod to the camera.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5djVOE46s64h7ElnAY8OtIBHuRX.jpg", "actors": ["Beatrice Marshall (Herself)", "Albert Treloar (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
