Now, he's in Vienna with his daughter, the city of his fondest memories since studying there as a boy. It doesn't take long for the charm of Vienna to work its magic on the former king: he quickly comes to terms with the new situation and is able to enjoy the Austrian capital sans all the ceremony and trappings which would otherwise accompany him on a state visit. The princess is content with preparing herself for a career as a pianist concert, while the former king takes a job as a chauffeur in the embassy of the country he once ruled. The revolutionaries are shocked; and his days in Vienna are numbered.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rwpqXF8nwvCjHu99USZf3SzPDgb.jpg", "actors": ["Adrian Hoven (Peter Lehnert, Musikprofessor)", "Erika Remberg (Sandra, Prinzessin von Alanien)", "Hans Holt (Alexander I., K\u00f6nig von Alanien)", "Hertha Feiler (Elisabeth Seyboldt)", "Oskar Sima (Gesandter von Trotum)", "Paul H\u00f6rbiger (Vater Lehnert)", "Alma Seidler (Mutter Lehnert)", "Jane Tilden (Klara von Trotum)", "Erwin Strahl (Mirko)", "Hannes Schiel (Morosos)", "Richard Romanowsky (Katzelseder)", "Lilly Stepanek (Mrs. von Waldegg)", "Alfred B\u00f6hm (Polizist)", "Peter Fr\u00f6hlich (Reporter)", "Fritz Muliar (Zweiter Bauarbeiter)", "Peter Brand (Chauffeur der Gesandtschaft)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
