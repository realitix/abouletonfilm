To arrange the sale of an inherited house, she must travel to the Canary Islands, and so puts an advert in a newspaper asking for a maid to accompany her, and a chauffeur to drive her car. Mercedes, a girl who works in a Museum in Madrid, and Tony, a student whose college has just started Summer vacation, answer the advert. Neither of them gets along with the other at all, but both are hired to make the trip with Eduvigis. Arriving in Tenerife, Mercedes and Tony discover that the house is worth much more than it appears, and much more than what is being offered.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e9pZL640DviC1RLlhFIIJw5GZpm.jpg", "actors": ["Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal (Mercedes)", "Enrique Guzm\u00e1n (Tony)", "Amalia de Isaura (Eduvigis)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [252536, 77335, 365279, 327558], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
