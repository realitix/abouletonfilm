Atypical not only because of its technical specs, but because of its narrative structure. There are several scenes with only the city in common, and more as a conceptual presence at that than as a precise geography. None of those scenes contains a single \"story\": Each one of them is part of a larger situation that we cannot see, as though the beginning and end of each \"story\" had to be filled in by the audience.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9clPJss1NTR3zJsuKvBI3M1ybvR.jpg", "actors": ["In\u00e9s Efron ()", "Julia Mart\u00ednez Rubio ()", "Guillermo Garc\u00eda Faure ()", "Duilio Orso ()", "Walter Jakob ()", "Romina Paula ()", "Mariana Chaud ()", "Maria Abadi ()", "Mart\u00edn Policastro ()", "Milagros Gallo ()", "Gonzalo Mart\u00ednez ()", "Clara Miglioli ()", "Ignacio Rogers ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
