The film opens with lights reflected in the eggs (of course), then, through single framing, pixilates a man's hand arranging eggs in different patterns. The hands (those of John Hawkins) fill the box back up with eggs. Next, the eggs do the same routine, but more magically, more serenely, without the assistance of the hands. Menken also introduces a string and a feather duster into animated action, so that the eggs, one by one, seem to be coming directly out of the duster (objects infect objects). By the end, the eggs are magically back in their box.\" Melissa Ragona", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e3lCPX8UdSHFyfx98stp5Uy7ih8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
