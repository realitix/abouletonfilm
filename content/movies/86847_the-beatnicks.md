Their luck begins to change when they find a box on the beach, a treasure chest of infinite beats that will set the stage for the ultimate success, a gig at the Monkey Club. But when Nick Nero falls in love with Nica, the club owners captive bride, he learns that they are some truths better left unsought. Hard knocks and a trip to rock bottom reunites the Nicks to preform the gig of a lifetime, and return the box to its source", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pqxdvCn9XWJaK6uxwf8NQ8Up5fI.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Boone Junior (Nick Beat)", "Norman Reedus (Nick Nero)", "\u00c9lodie Bouchez (Nica)", "Eric Roberts (Mack Drake)", "Patrick Bauchau (Hank)", "Lisa Marie (Sophie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
