Walzer is a poem written by Novalis, the German romantic poet (1772-1801) to mark the premature death of his fianc\u00e9e Sophie von K\u00fchn. The text of Walzer is recited and appears in a spiral - the spiral of life? Lyric-Clip reflects the transience of youth as borne out by the macabre, dancing skeleton that appears on screen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/daIb8K6r0mGzwYBBE9f3l83Fgz8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
