These are the private paradises in which the Danes in The Home Front live. But wait a minute - is that a dog barking? Is that gardener peeking over the fence, and are the branches he's trimming falling on the right side? The smallest trifle in the world can send neighbors who once merrily drank beer together into arguments that last years. But when the distrust is so thick you can cut it with a knife, there's still hope. In order to help the desperate parties, the Danish government came up with the Fence Committee, an institution that mediates and makes binding decisions when necessary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Fv7LBtDX2PVFAKqzX4FB3BIRI5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
