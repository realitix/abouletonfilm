At night, I wander through the streets, in search of resemblances, in the faces and the bodies of others. For whom do I close my eyes at night? A phantom image, a single face that is not there. I show a world that is not mine, that is not real. The image carries my words, words that are eroded. What can I tell, close to the places that I do not show you?\u201d (MC)", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
