Jane loved Roderick, until they slept together and she learned he'd been keeping his long-term relationship a secret. Now she is nagged by questions: Why did he wrong her? Who is this other woman? What happened to the seemingly sweet man she fell for? How does infidelity still happen? She finds him and confronts him without malice or spite, attempting to make the self-identified \"nice guy\" explain his chauvinistic behavior.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/snxRbGIZGIBmbg8RzzmgDiWUYTL.jpg", "actors": ["Michelle Siracusa ()", "Nick Smerkanich ()", "Theodora Blasko ()", "Cooper McKim ()", "Chris Donohue ()", "Stephanie Ulm ()", "Alex Heim ()", "Tucker Johnson ()", "Mike McCreary ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
