The first 20 minutes or so recap his retirement, attempt at minor league baseball, and his dealing with his father's murder. It picks up when it starts looking at the huge frenzy that was his return to the NBA in the Spring of 1995. It covers his mediocre first game back against the Pacers, his Friday night Chicago return against the Magic, and his subsequent return to form with a game-winning shot against Atlanta, and a career night dropping 55 on the Knicks.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6DWYbHoEE2TOgntdriR0d0OYq5A.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Jordan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [69049, 51954, 31848, 52370], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
