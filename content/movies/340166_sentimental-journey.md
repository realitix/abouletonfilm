The film then changes to black and white and the argument continues about houses and planning, with shots of the destruction of a house, and shots from other films of the houses it used to be. The arguments are not conclusive and the film is about doubts rather than certainties. - A.R.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qzMHSehK8Mx0B0cZ8UL0gAQ15CL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
