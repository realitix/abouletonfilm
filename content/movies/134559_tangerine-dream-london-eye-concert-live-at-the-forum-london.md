London\u2018s and TD\u2018s soundscapes are so unique like a score to a movie. The British influence in TD\u2018s music within their 40 years\u2018 development most people may have recognised. For those who couldn\u2018t join the concert or like to relive it again: Here\u2018s the full cut of their beat show on Blue Ray at the Forum in Kentishtown. A kaleidoscope beginning with the new title \u201dTrauma\u201c (Autumn In Hiroshima) and ending with the breathtaking live interpretation of the TD classic \u201dCloudburst Flight\u201c. Enjoy a great concert on Blu Ray - nearly 3 hours with a very fresh mastering.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/omYscaRXpHtpIY0ZEU6GMbi1rho.jpg", "actors": ["Edgar Froese (Keyboards)", "Thorsten Quaeschning (Keyboards)", "Linda Spa (Keyboards, Sax, Flute)", "Iris Camaa (Drums, percussion)", "Bernhard Beibl (Guitar, Violin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
