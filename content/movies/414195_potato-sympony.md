They clashed constantly with \u2018The Picks\u2019, a gang led by Jin-han. They were always better than the Picks. Twenty years later, Baek-i\u2019s crew, now nearing forty, meet for drinks. They mull over the news that Jin-han donated a scholarship to his high school, even though he had been expelled. And when Baek-i's friend Hyuk and Jul-byuk get beaten up by the members of the Picks for a trivial reason, a new situation arises.
