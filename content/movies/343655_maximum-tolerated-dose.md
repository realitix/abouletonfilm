Equal parts found-footage mash-up, verit\u00e9 investigation, and artful meditation, the film charts the lives of both humans and non-humans who have experienced animal testing first-hand, with hauntingly honest testimony of scientists and lab technicians whose ethics demanded they choose a different path, as well as the simultaneously heartwarming and heartbreaking stories of animals who have seen both sides of the cage. MTD aims to re-ignite the debate about animal testing by bringing these rarely-heard perspectives to the fore.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oyYU7Qk7HuC6rJjhHigD9xsjfjE.jpg", "actors": ["Eric Thomas Bachli (Self)", "Dr. Lynda Birke (Self)", "Dr. Ned Buyukmihci (Self)", "Gloria Grow (Self)", "Sarah Kite (Self)", "Dr. John Pippin (Self)", "Erika Sullivan (Self)", "Rachel Weiss (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
