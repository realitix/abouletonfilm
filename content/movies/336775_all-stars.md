In the vein of \"Best in Show\", where it's more about the dog owners than the dogs - \"All-Stars\" is about the adults involved in youth sports (parents, coaches, umpires, volunteers, board members, etc.) more than the kids. The end result is a funny, yet compelling spin on fast pitch softball as well as a unique state of affairs on the outlandish antics of a few crazed parents.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vSSHbONtRuh1Onzq3lBntZXubzR.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Kind (Richard Kline)", "Seth Morris (Joel Levitan)", "Lance Kinsey (Lance Grayden)", "Nicole Sullivan (Jill Levitan)", "Mike Hagerty (Mike Garland)", "Mary Lynn Rajskub (Tina Travanti)", "Angela Kinsey (Debbie Shipman)", "Fred Willard (John Carson)", "Illeana Douglas (Billie Burke)", "Christian Kane (Jim Hall)", "Rose Abdoo (Rose Foley)", "Jenica Bergere (Jenica Harmon)", "Joshua Funk (Josh Harmon)", "Sam Richardson (Ramel Johnson)", "Kyle Howard (Brad Twersky)", "Danielle Nicolet (Kim Lockemer)", "John Goodman (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [389323, 319080, 324252, 27933], "youtube_key": "T0gS0Hdr6Eg"}
