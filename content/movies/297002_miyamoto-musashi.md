In Part I we see the young would-be swordsman setting out to achieve greatness in war, achieving nothing because fighting on the losing side, &amp; then beginning his long period of wandering &amp; training, with the goal always in mind of his duel with Kojiro. Part II builds toward that great duel on Ganryu Island, with considerable focus on Musashi's planning &amp; forethought as to how to gain an advantage. Rather than the Zen questor of Inagaki &amp; Uchida's versions, we come to realize by watching Kato's film that this Musashi is a calculating, cold- blood trickster, scientific in his approach. This is close to the truth of Musashi's historical self, for he was an opportunist first &amp; sentimentalist last.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y8JZ0aJclklDVaKAQBp2pCokIZz.jpg", "actors": ["Hideki Takahashi (Musashi Miyamoto)", "Jir\u00f4 Tamiya (Kojiro Sasaki)", "Keiko Matsuzaka (Otsu)", "Frankie Sakai (Honiden Matahachi)", "Mitsuko Baisho (Akemi)", "Chish\u016b Ry\u016b (Takuan)", "Toshiyuki Hosokawa (Seijuro Yoshioka)", "Yoshi Kat\u00f4 (Sado Nagaoka)", "Ushio Akashi ()", "Kawashima Akimitsu ()", "Ichir\u00f4 Arishima (Kobayashi Tarozaemon)", "Seiji End\u00f4 ()", "Akashi Goro ()", "Takigawa Goro ()", "Kenkichi Hamahata (Hosokawa Tadatoshi)", "Takanobu Hozumi (Gion Toji)", "Kentar\u00f4 Imai ()", "Tomiko Ishii ()", "Kenjiro Ishiyama (Mibu Genzaemon)", "Rintar\u00f4 Kaga ()", "Osugi Kanjiro ()", "Jun Kashima ()", "Takeshi Kat\u00f4 (Iwama Kakubei)", "Taku Kido ()", "Kenji Kimura ()", "Toshie Kimura (Oko)", "Ry\u00fbsuke Kita ()", "Akitake K\u00f4no (Kimura Sukekuro)", "Hisakage Maebara ()", "Fuyukichi Maki ()", "Yoshihara Masahiro ()", "Tamura Masakatsu ()", "Nao Matsubara ()", "Ry\u00f4ko Mizuki ()", "Kazuko Motohashi ()", "Kiyo Murakami ()", "Sh\u00f4sei Mut\u00f4 ()", "Koji Nakada ()", "Akiko Nishina (Omitsu)", "Y\u00f4ichi Numata ()", "S\u00f4nosuke Oda ()", "Toshio Ohkubo ()", "Tsuneo Ohsugi ()", "Tadayuki Okamoto ()", "Shuichi Oki ()", "Takuya Shima ()", "Akira Shioji (Togiya Kosuke)", "Kenji Sonoda ()", "Nobuo Takagi ()", "Yoshiz\u00f4 Takahata ()", "Kazuhiro Takasugi ()", "Yoshino Tani ()", "Masahiko Tanimura (Sasuke)", "Ofuna Taro ()", "Masaki Tatsuya ()", "Rokk\u00f4 Toura (Shishido Baiken)", "Keiji Tsuchida ()", "Junk\u00f4 T\u00f4da (Osugi)", "Hara Yasuji ()", "Hinoki Yoji ()", "Taki Yoshiro ()", "Tsubaki Yunji ()", "Minamoto Yusuke ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
