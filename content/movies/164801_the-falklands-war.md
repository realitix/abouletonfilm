It is over twenty years since Argentine forces invaded the Falkland Islands. Within three days, a British task force had been mobilised and was on its way to the South Atlantic on a mission to restore the islands to British control. Soon, harrowing images that demonstrated the terrible realities of war were being beamed back to the United Kingdom. This twentieth anniversary commemorative programme is a powerful record of a war that cost more than a thousand lives. It features remarkable archive footage of the fight for the Falkland Islands, atmospheric battle reconstructions and 3D animated graphics that provide a unique perspective on famous battles such as Goose Green, Tumbledown Mountain and Wireless Ridge. \u2018The Falklands War\u2019 also features the memories and recollections of British and Argentine servicemen who went to war in the South Atlantic more than twenty years ago.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qLyeA7pWtXiHXmsHxMgiZFqMO7k.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
