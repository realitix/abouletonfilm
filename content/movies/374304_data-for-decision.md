Examining the arduous work of assessing and documenting the geographical landscape, including sampling and analysis of soil, forestry, timber, wildlife, resources, industrial sites, and many other aspects, we see that human beings alone couldn't handle the vast amount of information that is collected. A new kind of computer (an \u201cinstant library\u201d), the Canada Land Inventory Geo-information System, was developed to help manage and develop Canadian land. This film examines the workings of this new and mysterious machine.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wkLoM8PSs9okMVfyN8i5EEqyrLE.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Gilbert (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
