However, behind of it was an oppression the marginalized female laborers had to endure. The film invites us to the lives of the working class women engaged in the textile industry of the 1960s, all the way through the stories of flight attendants, cashiers, and non-regular workers of today. As we encounter the vista of female factory workers in Cambodia that poignantly resembles the labor history of Korea, the form of labor changes its appearance but the essence of the bread-and-butter question remains still.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/seqNOD94VQ0ziPO2T0SDbxtoRoM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "g_vGsqzYPHU"}
