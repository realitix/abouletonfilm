Based on one of those original productions, Georges Wakhevitch produced stage settings and transformations that supported Karajan's concept with every possible means. Herbert Von Karajan's staging is in the epic style of another age, emphasizing the dignity of the gods rather than their all too human failings. With the singers - foremost among them Peter Schreier - Karajan had an ensemble that fully conformed to his intentions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eY8xpiLMzuFswX19wmJNnxm3OkW.jpg", "actors": ["Herbert von Karajan (Dirigent)", "Thomas Stewart (Wotan)", "Vladimir de Kanel (Donner (actor))", "Leif Roar (Donner (singer))", "Hermann Esser (Froh)", "Peter Schreier (Loge)", "Zolt\u00e1n Kelemen (Alberich)", "Gerhard Stolze (Mime)", "Gerd Nienstedt (Fasolt (actor))", "Karl Ridderbusch (Fasolt (singer))", "Louis Hendrikx (Fafner)", "Brigitte Fassbaender (Fricka)", "Jeannine Altmeyer (Freia)", "Martha M\u00f6dl (Erda (actor))", "Birgit Finnil\u00e4 (Erda (singer))", "Eva Randov\u00e1 (Woglinde)", "Edda Moser (Wellgunde)", "Liselotte Rebmann (Flosshilde)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
