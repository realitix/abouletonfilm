A large tabby cat sits perkily in front of the hospital. An old woman comes up to him and strokes him. A tall man calls out for him. A little girl lures him with a treat. The cat is present every day, quietly looking around. It\u2019s hard to imagine the hospital without him. He is a subject of conversation, makes people smile and offers consolation. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit of a mascot for me,\u201d says one woman as she lights her cigarette. \u201cIf he is there, I\u2019m fine.\u201d What the Cat Sees is a portrait of the patients of the hospital, who pass by this special cat every day.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d6vFe0BfVcgZCp9eoTPn5F6iIe4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
