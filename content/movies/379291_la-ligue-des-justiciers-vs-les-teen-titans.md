The violence is initially somewhat cathartic, in a _Dragonball Z_ kind of way, but that wears thin quickly and the incredibly unusual decision making takes hold. There are a handful of concepts explored in Justice League VS Teen Titans that felt like they could have been quite interesting if they were dealt with in a longer, more personal format, like a television show. Instead because we're pressed for time in this animated feature, we have to montage through all that in some truly bizarre ways.\r\n\r\nThe \"versing\" is also, unsurprisingly, pretty bull."}], "recommandations_id": [408647, 366924, 297556, 408220]}
