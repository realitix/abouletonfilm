The 64-minute documentary eschews much of the tabloid sensationalism that shrouded the genre in the early to mid-'90s, focusing instead on the music itself, an element thus far overlooked by the mainstream media.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5qrSoPHuMnJm5qKSEu4iBwFx8D0.jpg", "actors": ["Mantas, Jeffrey Dunn (Himself)", "Attila Csihar (Himself)", "Charles \u201eGhul\u201d Hedger (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
