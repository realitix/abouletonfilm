Urgent questions pound inside his head. \"Where was I last night? Who was I with?\" Marcus suffers from parasomnia, a rare sleep disorder which causes him to do things in his sleep which he cannot remember the next day. His situation takes a horrifying turn when Marcus wakes up covered in blood with a knife at his side. Then, the wife of his best friend is found stabbed to death. Marcus is terrified to put together the pieces - could he have murdered her in his sleep to hide a dark secret between them? Mysterious phone calls make Marcus believe someone is watching him. He investigates his own nocturnal activities, desperate to figure out what happens after he goes to sleep at night. His journey to discover the truth ends in a shocking discovery.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vGO8WEMGqdOVP47HKDtYZCwVuQ0.jpg", "actors": ["Philip Winchester (Marcus)", "Tim Draxl (Justin)", "Lacey Chabert (Becky)", "Abigail Spencer (Gwen)", "Kelly Overton (Ann)", "Amy Aquino (Detective Curwen)", "Tony Hale (Ben)", "Kevin Kilner (Greg)", "Aidan Mitchell (Young Marcus)", "Michael Badalucco (Derek)", "Beth Grant (Evelyn)", "Alexandra Paul (Roxana)", "Kirsten Vangsness (Madge)", "Allan Wasserman (Dr. Schwarz)", "Patrick Labyorteaux (Rob)", "Vanessa Evigan (Kelly)", "Kathryn Fiore (Lisa)", "Bellamy Young (Olivia)", "Shanna Collins (Jennifer)", "Marcelle Larice (Carissa)", "Christopher Darga (Officer Etling)", "Larry Clarke (Officer Knachel)", "Robert Joseph (Officer Cooley)", "Joe Nunez (Mr. Mather)", "Bunny Levine (Rachel)", "Natalie DuBose (Keri)", "Kevin Michael Curran (David)", "Sean Gabriel Moore (Little Justin)", "Joy Bisco (Exotic Woman)", "Nancy Sexton (Tall Woman)", "Jessica Martine (Club Woman)", "Jamie Tisdale (Club Woman)", "Joshua Lee (Bartender)", "Christiann Castellanos (Babysitter)", "Jacqueline Hickel (Babysitter)", "Syr Law (Babysitter)", "Brenda Schmid (Babysitter)", "Jade Tailor (Babysitter)", "Julia Faye West (Club Patron (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [83716, 61533, 208656, 167919], "youtube_key": "VmJy-7CfxTs"}
