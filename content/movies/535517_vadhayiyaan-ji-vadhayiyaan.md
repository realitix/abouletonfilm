When Pargat, a local boy, is smitten by Gagan she makes it very clear that any union must be approved by her father, hence begins Pargat's attempts to impress her father. Due to much of his bad luck, every attempt by him, and with the help of his friends, Sukhi and Honey, all go haywire and it seems he has no chance of impressing Gagan's father. Eventually with Gagan's intervention her father agrees to meet Pargat and wedding talks ensue. After a night of binge drinking on laced local brew, or due to \"bad omens', Pargat LOSES his sight! Thus begins Pargat's struggle to get through the wedding without anyone especially Gagan knowing about his temporary handicap.
