Told entirely from the perspective of the boy, Xiao Wu, this story of two very different characters is less about friendship than about a shared experience and appreciation of solitude. \"4:30\" starts with Xiao sneaking to the room of Jung in the early hours of the morning, and stealing from the Korean man. Just as getting intoxicated is a habit for Jung, who only staggers back to his rented room when drunk, soon stealing for Xiao Wu becomes equally as compulsive. We soon realize that Jung's true intention for staying in Singapore is suicide. It is only through Xiao's encounter with Jung failing in his bid to die that he begins to understand his true fascination with Jung.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7UmmfxA96BPAGpkQ2IYORgcAK7A.jpg", "actors": ["Young-jun Kim (Jung)", "Xiao Li Yuan (Xiao Wu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [72489, 79860, 149145, 179868], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
