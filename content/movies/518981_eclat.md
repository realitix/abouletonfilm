We witness rehearsals by the Netherlands' Nieuw Ensemble, hear comments about the piece from the composer, conductor Ed Spanjaard and some of the musicians, and we see a full performance of the work. Eclat (\"To burst out\") is a beautiful example of the strangely lyrical pointillist style that Boulez had inherited from Anton von Webern. Aural pinwheels and shifting musical kaleidoscopes with stunning instrumental color is the only way to verbally describe what must be heard to be understood. This is definitely not for those who hate \"modern\" music. For those who respond to contemporary music, this piece is masterful and this film is a must-see!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4a9llxftPdYUXT1FPS1smzFWHkx.jpg", "actors": ["Pierre Boulez ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
