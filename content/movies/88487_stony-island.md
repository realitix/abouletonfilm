Telling the story of a group of multiracial R&B performers, and how they\u2019re affected by the death of a veteran musician from their circle, Stony Island is an incredible time capsule, and provides a sweetly funky soundtrack to boot!\" -- The Cinefamily", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bKo3gp7vctCxfb8n7PckLYarxSs.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Davis ()", "Edward Stoney Robinson ()", "Gene Barge ()", "Rae Dawn Chong ()", "Susanna Hoffs ()", "George Englund Jr ()", "Dennis Franz ()", "Billy Preston ()", "Phil Upchurch ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
