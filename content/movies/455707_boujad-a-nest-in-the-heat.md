As director Hakim Belabbes chronicles his journey from his home in Chicago to visit his family in his hometown of Boujad in Morocco, his exploration of family relationships is self-conscious and at times painfully honest. We witness his most private moments with his family. Belabbes' film intimately explores the domestic spaces and religious rituals of intra-family relationships, especially when compounded by one member's break with traditional values.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k3v7tM5ZRz30n83wGJTLYoAaTWw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
