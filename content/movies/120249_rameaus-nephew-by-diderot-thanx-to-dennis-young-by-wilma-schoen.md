In his words, the film \u201cderives its form and the nature of its possible effects from its being built from the inside, as it were, with the actual units of such a film, i.e. the frame and the recorded syllable. Thus its \u2018dramatic\u2019 element derives not only from a representation of what may involve us generally in life but from considerations of the nature of recorded speech in relation to moving light-images of people.\u2019\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qZj9rzBB6SRa29YMCdMeLwaX1DR.jpg", "actors": ["Kevin Wenzel ()", "Munro Ferguson ()", "Jim Murphy ()", "Jonas Mekas ()", "Harry Gantt ()", "Joyce Wieland ()", "Barry Gerson ()", "Helene Kaplan ()", "Bob Cowan ()", "Ping Chong ()", "Nam June Paik (Tom)", "Steve Anker ()", "Roz Michaels ()", "P.
