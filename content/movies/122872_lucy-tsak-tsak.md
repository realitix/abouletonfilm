We see the hands of a film editor cutting away the initial frame of strips of film; then we see a montage of these outtakes: a woman with long black hair claps the slate board at the start of take after take. She is Lucy, she calls the slate \"tsak tsak.\" We hear Lucy's clap at least 55 times for the film \"Tuvalu\" (1999). Rolling credits at the end tell us of her career: for more than 30 years, 56 feature films, 3 documentaries, two series, 7200 claps of the slate for each film, nearly half a million claps, and over 382 hours of her image on film - without appearing in a single motion picture, until now.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
