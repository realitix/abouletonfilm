{"tmdb_id": 90988, "title": "Aida", "original_title": "Aida", "slug_title": "aida", "date": "1989-10-06", "genre": ["Drame / Musique"], "score": "5.2/10", "synopsis": "AIDA, an Ethiopian princess, is captured and brought into slavery in Egypt. A military commander, Radam\u00e8s, struggles to choose between his love for her and his loyalty to the Pharaoh. To complicate the story further, Radam\u00e8s is loved by the Pharaoh's daughter Amneris, although he does not return her feelings. Sonja Frisell\u2019s production captures all the grandeur and excitement of Verdi\u2019s monumental opera, particularly the great triumphal scene where the Egyptian army, led by Radam\u00e8s (Pl\u00e1cido Domingo), returns victorious from war. Aprile Millo is Aida, the slave girl whose love for Radam\u00e8s has her squaring off with Amneris (Dolora Zajick), the Egyptian princess who also loves him. Sherrill Milnes is Amonasro, and James Levine leads The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, Chorus, and Ballet.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hOCmdVNTOR7hi3fwkcqJQqJFLnI.jpg", "actors": ["Aprile Millo (Aida)", "Dolora Zajick (Amneris)", "Sherrill Milnes (Amonasro)", "Paata Burchuladze (Ramfis)", "Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (Radam\u00e8s)", "Dimitri Kavrakos (Il Re dell'Egitto)", "Mark Baker (Un Messaggero)", "Margaret Jane Wray (Sacerdotessa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
