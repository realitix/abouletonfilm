For more than two decades, Deacon has created unique sculptures in a wide range of materials such as laminated wood, polycarbonate, leather, cloth and ceramic. Working on both a domestic and monumental scale, his structures combine organic and biomorphic forms with elements of engineering. The sculptures are defined by the space within and around them, as much as the solidity of their shape.  Deacon's dissatisfaction with the materials commonly associated with outdoor works drove him to explore the use of clay on a large-scale, overcoming technical difficulties to produce a body of work such as Another Kind Of Blue (2005) or Flower (2004) that illustrates his fascination with the relationship between the physical and the material.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e92GUmZImr1QTvUQA29mZFPDZgx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
