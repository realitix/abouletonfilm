It is based on a short story written by Justin Spooner. The film seeks to convey the power of sound to store and evoke memory. It both recounts and reimagines aspects of his grandmother\u2019s life. The film is told from the vantage point of her granddaughter, voiced by Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9. Where is Eva Hipsey? mixes fact and fiction to search for a truth or representation of Eva\u2019s reality, past and present. It combines experimental animation techniques with archival material taken from both Spooner and Mc Hardy\u2019s grandmothers\u2019 collections; family photographs, v\u00e9rit\u00e9 camerawork, sketchbooks and field recordings, to suggest a journey. Driven by curiosity and a desire to listen deeply, Eva explores and attempts to capture the world around her, stepping further and further from the familiar.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
