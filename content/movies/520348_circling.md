They mirror, they contradict, they caricature each other. And again, all human thinking seems to be an enormous utopia within the framework we can hardly adjust. Our physical space is limited, but therein, mental constructions come to improbable proportions.  The film connects fragments of memories, thoughts and observations, finding recurrent themes in different graduation. Therefore these fragments become something different, they form their own.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eWhrdSwOykzNvRC98n5StO2qL4y.jpg", "actors": ["Lea Fresenius ()", "Anna Hirschmann ()", "Ruth  Rupp ()", "Dirk Hoener ()", "Heinrich Vogt ()", "Thomy Kessler ()", "Leena Fahje ()", "Joachim Kappl ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
