His dad's in the army and they've just moved to a town in New South Wales; his mom is pregnant; his older brother, Charlie, who's autistic, has his own adolescent sexual issues. Thomas finds Charlie an embarrassment in public, so when Thomas is attracted to Jackie, a girl in his swim class, Charlie presents any number of obstacles when she drops by their house, when the three of them go for a walk, and during a family birthday dinner. Can Thomas find a way to enter the world of teen romance and still be his brother's keeper, or is Charlie's disability going to prove more than Thomas can handle?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gi2qtnQ8Jw72wfJQYbvJbgp1xLF.jpg", "actors": ["Toni Collette (Maggie Mollison)", "Rhys Wakefield (Thomas Mollison)", "Luke Ford (Charlie Mollison)", "Gemma Ward (Jackie Masters)", "Lisa Kowalski (Sally)", "Nathin Butler (Chris)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [51249, 14630, 68876, 36714], "youtube_key": "IiyAfaXmbrk"}
