Bestselling horror novelist Claire Huston (Dawn Duvurger) has a sure way of producing creepy story after story - she steals them from a dead master of the macabre using a spirit board. What follows are four stories of suspense and terror... though not without consequence. Alice (Mona Duvera) encounters an all-too familiar ventriloquist doll; Bobby (Amber Peach) knows something is watching her from within the walls of her home; a crazed sniper (Eric Spudic) uses geocaching as a lure for his victim (Krystal Stevenson Akin); and a man (J.C. Pennylegion) attempts to resurrect his dead wife, brought to him by two grave robbers (Denman Powers, Kirk Jordan).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tE60Tut5JEOETwdw3CgYwqnqeGI.jpg", "actors": ["Donny Versiga (Pest Control Man)", "Eric Spudic (Sniper)", "Dawn DuVurger (Claire)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
