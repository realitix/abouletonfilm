It's hard to depict methamphetamine use with any sensitivity, but this movie's dry and frank style bring this plague into startling focus. It's very compassionate and gives a lot of context and insight into how Gay culture and drug culture meet. It is heartbreaking to know that the majority of the men interviewed for this movie are HIV-positive. This movie includes graphic sexual content and vivid depictions of drug use, but it serves a very valuable purpose. it is an eloquent call for social responsibility.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vONLLOgA7uvq71fn3xrgklczvZn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "PZ1KeepKbI4"}
