HAWAII is a film project made by Rock Ross and Michael Rudnick in the early 1970s while both were students at the San Francisco Art Institute. It is a unique sampler of all the various cameras, lenses, film equipment, techniques, filmstocks, editing, lighting, A/B/C/D roll FX, tricks and gimmicks. These various disciplines were incorporated into the film as they were learned.
