While maintaining a friendship with his comrade, Mr. Hanson is obviously interested in Mr. Harbord's fickle moll, the lovely Lya de Putti (as Katie Fox). After Harbord kills the local police chief (during a gunfight) he is driven underground; leaving Ms. de Putti free to hook up with Hanson. Then, when Harbord surfaces to visit his mother, Hanson suspects he is seeing de Putti. So, Hanson becomes \"The Informer\", hounded by detective Warwick Ward (as Dan Gallagher).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jL397t1kbsjvckXR4xi0k9Vh8OI.jpg", "actors": ["Lya De Putti (Katie Fox)", "Lars Hanson (Gypo Nolan)", "Warwick Ward (Dan Gallagher)", "Carl Harbord (Francis McPhillip)", "Dennis Wyndham (Murphy)", "Janice Adair (Bessie)", "Daisy Campbell (Mrs McPhillip)", "Craighall Sherry (Mulholland)", "Ellen Pollock (Prostitute)", "Johnny Butt (Publican)", "Ray Milland (Sharpshooter (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [82203, 27811, 186782, 148820], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
