Thousands of Hollywood hopefuls lineup around the block to be selected to strike a deal with Satan himself in order to achieve the unattainable stardom they so desperately seek. The turnout yields not only dedicated actors and musicians who can't get a break, but a legion of seemingly successful people willing to sign in blood not to attain immortality or world peace - but for material things like money, houses, cars and diamonds or even lesser things like a gun you never have to re-load. Ultimately, Kai Blackwood, an aspiring rock star is chosen and embarks on a nefarious path of real-life occult practices following the instructions laid out in the ancient book 'Le Grande Grimoire' and proceeds to LITERALLY sell his soul to the Devil.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sXeqX1Z5avNeJa8nJBA7ljewuzW.jpg", "actors": ["Kai Blackwood (Himself)", "Jymie Darling ()", "Father Mike ()", "Maja d'Aoust ()", "Patti Negri ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
