The conversations are candid, and even veer into the territory of murder. In the final credits, the director apologizes to Jim Jarmusch, whose work (in the anthology Coffee and Cigarettes, which Jarmusch shot in pieces over many years) Oldenburg-Svintsov is clearly indebted to. Sex, Coffee, Cigarettes\u2019s kinship with Jarmusch\u2019s film extends to the fact that superstars play tiny roles in almost all of the vignettes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t1kBYBdJR9zLdfMYObKhKCyJnQq.jpg", "actors": ["Anna Chipovskaya ()", "Anton Shagin ()", "Agniya Ditkovskite ()", "Konstantin Kryukov ()", "Alisa Grebenshchikova ()", "Anna Starshenbaum ()", "G\u00e9rard Depardieu ()", "Aleksandr Bashirov ()", "Aleksandr Peskov ()", "Evdokiya Germanova (Flora - Professor (segment Flora and Fauna))", "Sergey Migitsko ()", "Ekaterina Volkova (Frivolous Woman (segment 'Father'))", "Mikhail Evlanov ()", "Lidiya Fedoseyeva-Shukshina ()", "Maksim Drozd ()", "Boris Kamorzin ()", "Aleksandr Semchev ()", "Polina Agureyeva ()", "Daniil Spivakovskiy ()", "Angelina Mirimskaya ()", "Aristarkh Venes ()", "Roman Viktyuk ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
