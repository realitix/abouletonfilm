The film version featured Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer, who (you guessed it) were man and wife at the time. The story traces the history of a marriage from the wedding night in 1890 to the death of the wife in the 1930s; all crucial scenes are acted out in the couple's boudoir, near the fourposter bed they'd received as a wedding present. The passing years, and the triumphs and tragedies of the couple, are wittily represented by transitional animation sequences produced by the UPA cartoon studios. A musical version of The Fourposter titled I Do I Do opened on Broadway in 1966, breaking precedent by starring Mary Martin and Robert Preston, who were happily married but not to each other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cnJJ5lDxjGpJBPxO3ZOuhbgWgzL.jpg", "actors": ["Rex Harrison (John Edwards)", "Lilli Palmer (Abby Edwards)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
