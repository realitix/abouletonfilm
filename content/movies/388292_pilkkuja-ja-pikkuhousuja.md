It's not just a romantic legend. In wry but basically directionless Finnish movie, Paavo Pentikainen plays one of these ungainly beings, a man whose last published work is decades in the past, who probably hasn't written anything in years, but who still has an uncanny knack for precise observation, \"pinning the tail on the donkey\" almost every time. In the movie, the poet, accompanied by his young assistant, takes a minor celebrity's swaggering tour of small cultural centers and retirement homes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2FmwV80e24CcFhjjlUzFYOeYdM8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
