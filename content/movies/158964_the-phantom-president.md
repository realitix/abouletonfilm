Blair; his party feels he has too little flair for savoir faire. But at a medicine show, the party bosses find Blair's double: huckster Doc Varney. Of course, they scheme to make Varney T.K.'s public spokesman; at first, he even fools Blair's girlfriend Felicia, providing a romantic complication. As election eve approaches, the conspirators face the problem of what to do with Varney...who has difficult decisions of his own to make.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sNSGvdbL6kc0w5s6E6O09S0rz1r.jpg", "actors": ["George M.
