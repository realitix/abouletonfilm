Hiding its public identity as a training school of singers and dancers, it actually operates as a girl-warrior training school, in order to win independence of the island. The secretly trained agents watch the music video of charismatic idol Cocoe on a huge TV monitor, and unlock codes from her dancing to complete their missions.
