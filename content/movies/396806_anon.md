It is a society with no privacy but what if the memories can be manipulated?\r\n\r\nSal Frieland (Clive Owen) is a detective who solves crimes by reviewing people's memories that exist in some kind of matrix where the memories are placed and can be accessed.\r\n\r\nWhen an anonymous hacker is suspected of killing some people, Sal figures it is a mysterious woman (Amanda Seyfried) who does not exist in their records as she is off the grid and who can alter the memory files.\r\n\r\nDirector Andrew Niccol pursues his interest in a futuristic society as he did in Gattaca. The film slows down when Sal and the mysterious woman hook up. Yet Sal finds himself in danger and also finds his own memories are hacked. However there is an air of predictability in the mystery aspects of the film."}], "recommandations_id": [411143, 476926, 429415, 385332]}
