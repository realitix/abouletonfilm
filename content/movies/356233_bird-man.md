During the 1970s dictatorship, he broke sexual taboos with a \"strange\" behavior on stage and became one of the most famous brazilian singers. Inspired in Cassiano Ricardo's concrete poems and the experimental music of Ney's repertoire, \"Bird-Man\" explores a sound and visual lyrical aesthetic of high contrasts that approximates man to nature's feelings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AdfXk1soeF6oE6rPcGAzjsWZKjG.jpg", "actors": ["Ney Matogrosso ()", "David Cunha ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
