A onetime member of San Francisco\u2019s legendary Cockettes theatre troupe, Goldie was famously crowned Santa Monica College\u2019s 1975 Homecoming Queen, captured in Bruce Yonemoto\u2019s documentary HOMECOMING (1975). GARAGE SALE subverts the drag aspect of Goldie\u2019s performance enabling her to sympathetically play a woman whose fantasies and expectations have been shaped by Hollywood romance films. The film follows the couple as Hero tries to regain Goldie\u2019s love by seeking the advice of a cast of eccentric characters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xtnvuX0brzryF8O5ZEwCEtSKJ7V.jpg", "actors": ["Goldie Glitters (Goldie)", "Tom White (Hero)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
