Led by a spiritual guide and a whip-bearing ringleader, a group of dancers ride woven horses in rhythmic unison until they are entered by spirits. Once possessed they engage in a range of self-mortification behaviors until safely emerging from their altered state, left with no memory of the event and no lingering ill effects.  The film combines footage of a number of Jathilan performances with interviews with dancers, spiritual leaders, anthropologists, and enthusiasts.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mScBuqjfPYbchuBOHJ4QDkv9UGd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "exLey-tzYwM"}
