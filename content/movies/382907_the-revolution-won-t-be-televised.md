Shortly afterwards, a group of school friends, including rappers Thiat and Kilifeu, set up \"Y'en a marre\" (\"We Are Fed Up\"), with filmmaker Rama Thiaw soon coming on board to start documenting events \u2013 meetings, campaigns, arrests, concerts, states of exhaustion, trips \u2013 from an \"insider\" perspective. Over several years, a stirring portrait emerged of a youth protest movement to whom independent observers were not the only ones to ascribe the role of \"kingmaker\" in the last elections. Rama Thiaw shows the rappers and their environment with an intimacy whose cinematographic finesse provides space and context for the thorny conflicts between music and politics, street and state.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ydNaJKsIEuGFG2iIM0mVVxM2JLQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
