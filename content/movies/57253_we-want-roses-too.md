Rather than focusing on the alleged objectivity of facts, the film gives space to a chorus of voices that narrate those events in first person, visually supported by archival footage of the period, drawn from the most varied sources - institutional, public, militant and private. Anita, Teresa and Valentina come from different Italian regions and different social backgrounds, but share the same feelings: they no longer feel as part of a society based on the patriarchal family, on the power of \"husbands\" and on the supremacy of males, which requires them to be efficient mothers, obedient wives and virtuous daughters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9WaFS1hK9j9SYHJmLoNtCGliAfv.jpg", "actors": ["Anita Caprioli (Anita (voice))", "Teresa Saponangelo (Teresa (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [40794], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
