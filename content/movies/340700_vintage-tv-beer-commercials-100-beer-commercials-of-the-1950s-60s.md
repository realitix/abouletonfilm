In their fight against the big boys, small town breweries enlisted television as their primary weapon. This wonderful video is a record of that historic battle, containing classic beer commercials like the Hamm's Bear, Bert &amp; Harry Piel, Mr. Magoo for Stag Beer, Mabel--Black Label, and dozens more. It's a truly unique piece of beer history, and loads of fun. Perfect for parties and beer tastings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uOR0WeAaGP5R1OkFt7X0IfiFjSg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
