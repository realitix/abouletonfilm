Now six of them remember the untold story of the first 17 days - when no-one outside knew if they were alive.  Filming down a Chilean mine, the program explores the nightmare of living in the dark tunnels half a mile underground, eating a spoonful of tuna every two days and not knowing if you would ever be found.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
