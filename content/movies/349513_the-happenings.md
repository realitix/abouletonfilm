These two have never succeeded in life, and are constantly in and out of prison. Two others who happen to be in the same boat as Deok-Bae and Dal-Soo are ex-convicts. They have threatened to commit suicide unless traffic and unemployment issues are resolved. They are also unlucky enough to have been spotted at the scene of a crime. While these four are making big plans for their first success, the city becomes wrapped up in a serial murder case. In the meantime, an investigating team of veteran cops is formed in order to solve this case.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/syYedN3fOXQbHrV6TfHhcO8KL11.jpg", "actors": ["Choi Jong-won ()", "Yang Taek-jo ()", "Lee Kyung-young ()", "Oh Yeong-su ()", "Son Hyun-joo ()", "Shin Ha-kyun ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
