No great shock there, it's an American Comedy in much the same vein as a great number of American Comedies that have come before it I didn't like. A lot of other people did like it. That's fine. Different strokes for different folks. All that jazz. I totally understand it. What I don't understand is the vast number of people who have said _\"This one's different. This movie is gonna appeal to the people who don't normally go in for this sort of thing. It breaks all the conventions and even Independent film & Oscar film fans will love it\"_. Like... No... When you follow up your piss-joke with the exact same piss-joke just seconds later... It's like... This is exactly the same as every other movie I hate.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605 - Of no value. Avoid at all costs._"}], "recommandations_id": [397422, 431530, 345914, 373569], "youtube_key": "mVhIJjEtNZY"}
