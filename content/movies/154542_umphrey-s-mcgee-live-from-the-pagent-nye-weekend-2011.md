Three nights and seven sets of classic Umphrey\u2019s McGee are now available for your viewing pleasure. Clocking in at almost nine and a half hours of music (gulp), these performances are raw, live and awesome. Live From The Pageant also contains unreleased bonus material from the Death By Stereo live in-studio webcast.  Both the video and audio were captured in real time, as it happened \u2013 no remixing, editing, 5.1 mixes or other blemish-reducing measures. What you saw is what you get.  Settle in and get after it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sLjUUoyHHydZkiglatrJ1TzmpE8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
