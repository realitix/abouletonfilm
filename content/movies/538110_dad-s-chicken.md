He hates his dying wife and his transsexual son - but not for the reasons you think. She won\u2019t let him obsessively cut coupons, and he/she fetishizes guns to the point of distraction. His other daughter is a dope fiend, and his recently deceased father was an out and out pervert. And don\u2019t even bring up autistic child prodigy Hobie. Desperate to play the violin, the partially blind boy spends his days roaming around the city, instrument in hand and toilet paper tube up to his bad eye. When the youthful talent meets European Ernie, it seems like everything will be all right. He coaches the child, and even suggests someone who might be able to teach him a thing or two. In the meantime, Mom and the sexually confused Shamu build a bomb. With Black Jesus out of the house, they intend to avenge the cultural attacks on religion once and for all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zOeXBCnlgLkFfqGR6zKrQhiiZ3q.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
