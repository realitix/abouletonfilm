Yoshida Sh\u014din (\u5409\u7530 \u677e\u9670, 1830-1859) was one of the most distinguished intellectuals in the closing days of the Tokugawa shogunate. He devoted to developing many Ishin Shishi who made an outstanding contribution to the Meiji Restoration. At least two of his students, Takasugi Shinsaku and It\u014d Hirobumi later became famous, and virtually all of the survivors of the Sonjuku group became officers in the Meiji Restoration. Takasugi led rifle companies against the shogun's army when it failed to conquer Ch\u014dsh\u016b in 1864, rapidly leading to the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Ito Hirobumi became Japan's first prime minister. His admirer, Maebara Issei, was later killed rebelling against the Meiji regime. He is now enshrined in Setagayaku-\uff08\u4e16\u7530\u8c37\u533a\uff09Tokyo, Japan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wUDB6rttlg2ttJPVMxaXokkmOAl.jpg", "actors": ["Hashinosuke Nakamura ()", "Mansai Nomura ()", "Yuki Amami ()", "Hiroshi Abe ()", "Masanobu Takashima ()", "Yukiyo Toake ()", "Hideki Takahashi ()", "Takashi Sasano ()", "Kankuro Nakamura ()", "Katsuhisa Namase ()", "Atsushi Yamanishi ()", "Marika Hayashi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
