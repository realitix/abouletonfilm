Fredo commands a crew of young people from poor families as he takes his rattletrap ship into the ocean in search of fish that live along the reefs, snaring catch with an illegal netting system. Not all of Fredo's youthful sailors are willing to put up with his abusive arrogance, however, and even his father Dado (Pen Medina) and close friend Botong (Jhong Hilario) have grown weary of Fredo's tirades. Fredo's body is beginning to betray him as well, and as he and his crew damage the sea's reef beds in search of fish, no one is certain how much longer he will be able to continue.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gfKa88sjZ1VpdWcFsSjBn3Lsc97.jpg", "actors": ["Cesar Montano ()", "Pen Medina ()", "Jhong Hilario ()", "Amy Austria ()", "Rebecca Lusterio ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
