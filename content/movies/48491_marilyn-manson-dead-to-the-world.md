The picketing zealots, the fulminating moralists, the disingenuous politicians, the tens of thousands who came to see for themselves and, of course, gazing outward from the very heart of the storm, Manson himself. One hour of live concert performances intercut with behind the scene and backstage footage that will help you to understand what it must have been like to be at the center of these extraordinary occurrences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bklnmUrQ7HDCxgvEG2gstUOVK8a.jpg", "actors": ["Jeordie White (Twiggy Ramirez)", "Madonna Wayne Gacy (Himself)", "Zim Zum (Himself)", "Ginger Fish (Himself)", "Marilyn Manson (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
