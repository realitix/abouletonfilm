But the hotel survived almost undamaged. It took another 40 years until it was finally demolished for economic reasons in 1967.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nmqjoU4WGDpOVsOgPodi5GrL0Y1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
