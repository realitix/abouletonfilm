Despite the fact that the film was filmed in 1954, it is quite spectacular. It was very interesting to watch Bond try to win at the <a href=\"http://blacksheepumich.com/\">jackpot city casino</a> with almost no poker skills. His way of thinking and incredible luck allowed him to fulfill his task. Although, honestly, it seems impossible to win at the casino from the first time. As they say, \"the casino always wins.\" I do not think that's just that. But the movie really captures you from the first minute of the movie"}], "recommandations_id": [71910, 34768, 31394, 71016]}
