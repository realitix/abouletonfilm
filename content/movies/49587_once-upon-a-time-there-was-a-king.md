When one of them says, \"more than salt\", he banishes her from the kingdom. Not understanding what she meant the King assumes love can only be measured by precious metals or one's own talent, the 'correct' answers from his other two daughters. The arrogance of the King leads him to gather all the salt in the kingdom and destroy it. Of course, this backfires as he slowly learns the universal value of the substance, and of course, the essence of his daughter's reply. With the help of the wise and magical old 'herb woman', the King also learns what it means to be a true and wise ruler.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rcJfVS6e3e1awOEtDQCtfXLCt0V.jpg", "actors": ["Milena Dvorsk\u00e1 (princezna Maru\u0161ka)", "Jan Werich (kr\u00e1l J\u00e1 I.)", "Vlasta Burian (kacl\u00e9\u0159 Atakd\u00e1le)", "Irena Ka\u010d\u00edrkov\u00e1 (princezna Drahom\u00edra)", "Milo\u0161 Kopeck\u00fd (chytr\u00fd princ)", "Stella M\u00e1jov\u00e1 (princezna Zp\u011bvanka)", "Lubom\u00edr Lipsk\u00fd (chrabr\u00fd princ)", "Miroslav Horn\u00ed\u010dek (kr\u00e1sn\u00fd princ)", "Terezie Brzkov\u00e1 (sta\u0159enka)", "Zden\u011bk D\u00edt\u011b (zahradn\u00edk)", "Vladim\u00edr R\u00e1\u017e (ryb\u00e1\u0159)", "Marie Gl\u00e1zrov\u00e1 (vdova Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1)", "Franti\u0161ek Hanus (pl\u00e1ten\u00edk)", "Eman Fiala (krej\u010d\u00ed)", "Franti\u0161ek \u010cern\u00fd (kucha\u0159)", "Josef Pehr (dud\u00e1k)", "Ji\u0159\u00ed Novotn\u00fd ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [75029, 116174, 287001, 65915], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
