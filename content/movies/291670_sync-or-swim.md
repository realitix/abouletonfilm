The film also examines the media storm that threatens the team's Olympic dreams when one of its members suffers devastating injuries and faces manslaughter charges as a result of a tragic car accident. Juxtaposing scenes that are intense and emotional, uplifting and mesmerizing, quirky and entertaining, Sync or Swim is the first-ever behind the scenes documentary about the making of the U.S. Olympic Synchronized Swimming Team.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fDBx7jLL0XU1RfBNnwsDF2hNjCD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
