It is a continuous struggle to manage from day to day. His bohemian friend, the wandering singer Janos, prefers to live free of all the demands of society, but is there to help him out. Stig believes that Janos is a great undiscovered talent and decides that the way out of his situation is by marketing Janos as a brilliant new artist, by which both of them can be successful. Janos isn\u2019t quite as enthusiastic about Stig\u2019s high-flying plans, but does his best to keep Stig\u2019s burning enthusiasm alive. All of a sudden Stig is reminded of his past, something which may change everything.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eDGoMOzm9KojNLuewShhmPOS0Xl.jpg", "actors": ["Rolf G.
