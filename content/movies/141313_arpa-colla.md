This is what the 2 main heroes of the film are doing. The one is a director(Giorgos) and the other an author(Kostas) with communistic ideas, who has won a prize at a festival. They both want to make a movie for the cinema. But every idea they have never comes true, because every time they meet someone to whom they tell their idea, they change their mind, and they want to make a totally different movie, ideas varying from political cinema to Greek historical dramas and modern films with motorcycle gangs. Not a bad attempt for the Greek cinema of the early 80's, which starts to wake up from the hibernation of the 70's.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xdfU3B9vYYuFlGnTyZTU23G1pvW.jpg", "actors": ["Mimis Chrisomalis (Giorgos Makropoulos)", "Nikos Kalogeropoulos (Kostas Antonakos)", "Despina Pajanou (Soula)", "Ilias Logothetis (Mr. Alexiou)", "Dimitris Piatas ()", "Nikos Rizos ()", "Ismini Kalessi ()", "Betty Livanou ()", "Rocky Taylor (Shirley)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [75194, 251779, 258636, 58686], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
