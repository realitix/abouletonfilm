Tracy introduces a number of professional circus acts, plus a cavalcade of movie stars who have side shows under the open air big tent. There is as much action in the audience as Tracy identifies a number of movie stars watching the proceedings incognito, having their own fun in the stands, and sometimes interacting with the circus acts.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d8IUY7GF5uUxrh2HKTr2L4Ho0Vv.jpg", "actors": ["Lee Tracy (Himself - Ringmaster)", "James Gleason (Himself)", "Alice Faye (Pert Kelton)", "Cliff Edwards (Himself)", "Pert Kelton (Pert Kelton)", "Allan Jones (Himself)", "Dixie Dunbar (Herself (uncredited))", "Hank Mann (Himself)", "Chester Conklin (Himself)", "Baby LeRoy (Himself)", "Leo Carrillo (Himself)", "Charles Murray (Himself)", "Ole Olsen (Himself (as Olsen))", "Boris Karloff (Himself)", "Mickey Rooney (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
