Macbeth is one of the most multi-layered, profound and demanding roles that Verdi ever wrote for a baritone and the Italian singer Leo Nucci is arguably the most distinguished in his field. The role has repeatedly brought him lasting success and he enacts it with an intensity that only the very experienced stage personality can muster. French singer Sylvie Valayre is known for her versatile interpretations of spinto and dramatic coloratura soprano parts, especially for particularly gruelling roles like Lady Macbeth. Supported by Italian bass Enrico Iori as Banco and tenor Roberto Iuliano as Macduff, they make up a wonderful cast under the baton of Bruno Bartoletti, musical director of the Teatro Regio di Parma.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eVDlBWeZLDSTmv3K24igOdpUhSn.jpg", "actors": ["Leo Nucci (Macbeth)", "Enrico Iori (Banco)", "Sylvie Valayre (Lady Macbeth)", "Tiziana Tramonti (Dama di Lady Macbeth)", "Roberto Iuliano (Macduff)", "Nicola Pascoli (Malcolm)", "Enrico Turco (Il medico)", "Davide Ronzoni (L'araldo)", "Riccardo Di Stefano (Un domestico)", "Norris Borgogelli (Il sicario)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
