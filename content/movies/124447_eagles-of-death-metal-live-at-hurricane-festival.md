Despite their band name, Eagles of Death Metal is not a death metal band. Hughes stated that a friend was introducing Josh Homme to the death metal genre. When he played a song by the Polish band Vader and made a claim that the song was within the death metal genre, Homme then referred to Vader as \"The Eagles of Death Metal\". After hearing this phrase, he wondered what a cross between the Eagles and a death metal band would sound like.[1] In a 2003 interview Homme described the sound of the band as a combination of \"bluegrass slide guitar mixed with stripper drum beats and Canned Heat vocals.\" Jesse Hughes is known by fans for his enthusiastic interaction with audiences at live performances.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5iPSlAclKCShkwYEG0fqiNZ06v6.jpg", "actors": ["Jesse Hughes (Himself)", "Troy Van Leeuwen (Himself)", "Brian O'Connor (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
