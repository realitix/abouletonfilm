For a full year we follow the peaceful battle that began during the first days of the uprising. We see artists, intellectuals, ex-military, and young Libyans who sought to lead a different kind of revolution, one of ideas. Beyond the Frontline is an intimate and humane story. It explores the contradictions that coexist within Libyan society, in their struggle for justice and liberty.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ok5kqk2oOI2kP9OxflbHzCzbkF6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "-1wj0F_y7W8"}
