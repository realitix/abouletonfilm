That of passengers in the Paris metro. they use a moving railway which takes them from one platform to another, from one line to another and from one destination to the next. What do we actually see ? The thick grain of the black and white film composes very pictorial images. Geometric shapes come and go. The faces of people come into view and then flit away. Glimpses of words, titles torn from posters, are interspersed between these fleeting encounters. The filmmaker ingeniously presents people according to affinities: mocking young girls in a hurry, tired old couples\u2026 This is a real com\u00e9die humaine presented to us \u2014 in a few fragments and a small number of shots. Then, a few minutes from the end, the cinematic process reaches the outermost limit and the images disintegrate. The film itself seems to decompose and the faces only leave their final impression on the canvas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mWd2hTZQd3ZjBJ0bRN0Epo9DAzT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
