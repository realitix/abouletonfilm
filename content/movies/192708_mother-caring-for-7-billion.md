Since the 1960s the world population has nearly doubled, adding more than 3 billion people. At the same time, talking about population has become politically incorrect because of the sensitivity of the issues surrounding the topic- religion, economics, family planning and gender inequality. The film illustrates both the over consumption and the inequity side of the population issue by following Beth, a mother, a child-rights activist and the last sibling of a large American family of twelve, as she discovers the thorny complexities of the population dilemma and highlights a different path to solve it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/10emHHFiTX6xMZv4wGEJ4xSwl2Z.jpg", "actors": ["Esraa Bani (Herself (Population Action International))", "Albert Bartlett (Himself - Host)", "Lester Brown (Himself (Earth Policy Institute))", "Martha Campbell (Herself (Venture Strategies))", "Susan Davis (Herself (BRAC))", "Brian Dixon (Himself (Population Connection))", "Paul Ehrlich (Himself - Host)", "Riane Eisler (Herself (Center for Partnership Studies))", "Katie Elmore (Herself (Population Media Center))", "John Feeney (Himself (Environmental writer))", "Sara Morello (Herself)", "Malcolm Potts (Himself (University of California at Berkeley))", "William N.
