They ain't got no money till the mystic plant reappears. Soon they have enough money for champagne, a penthouse and a nice car. But everyone's got private problems. H\u00e4schens girlfriend Valerie is in Sevilla, Max is too shy to go into Berlin's gay-clubs and Ziege is in love with the girlfriend of a manager of a big company.

Of course the old problems reappear.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wWRUVgAepxrJ7SnqOLqT9gai6LN.jpg", "actors": ["Andr\u00e9 Kaminski (Anton 'Ziege' Ziegler)", "Jacob Matschenz (Adam 'H\u00e4schen' Hoppeczynski)", "Jonas J\u00e4germeyr (Max Spackmann)", "Susan Hoecke (Natascha)", "Thorsten Feller (Hubertus)", "Florian G\u00e4rtner (Dicker Pf\u00f6rtner)", "Zoe Weiland (Valerie)", "Mareike Lindenmeyer (Ines)", "Sabine Kaack (Gabi)", "Marcus Kaloff (Klaus)", "David Montero (Juan)", "Eva Wei\u00dfenborn (Frau Pakowski)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [36910, 6183], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
