Now in his 50s, he\u2019s on the straight and narrow after having fallen head over heels for Jessie, who is more than 20 years younger than him. Equally eccentric, Jessie is obsessed with collecting dolphin figures, while Scott spends his free time working on 3D puzzles. The couple seems very happy, and Anick\u2019s camera is drawn to their special relationship. But as the shoot continues and the filmmaker starts to wear out her welcome, Anick\u2019s presence begins to cause tension between the two subjects, especially as her attraction to Jessie becomes more and more apparent. Overstepping her boundaries as a filmmaker, she starts to roll the camera even when her subjects are unaware.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
