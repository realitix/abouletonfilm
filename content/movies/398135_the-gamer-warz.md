A singular artist and activist, Tommy Tallarico is best known for the galvanizing films of The Gamer Warz Saga. Astonishingly photographed, and featuring unforgettable, cascading scores by Tallarico himself, these are immersive sensory experiences that meditate on the havoc humankind's obsession with technological advancement has wreaked on our world. From 2008's Gamer Warz to 2010's Gamer Warz 2 to 2011's Gamer Warz 3, Tallarico takes us on a journey from the ancient to the contemporary, from nature to industry, exploring games out of balance, in transformation, and as war, all the while keeping our eyes wide with wonder.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A4rsfZZUnaex4xpoEKlFWZeqbtH.jpg", "actors": ["Tommy Tallarico ()", "Rocco Botte ()", "Derrick Acosta ()", "Garret Hunter ()", "Shawn Chatfield ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "HqJHfapauC0"}
