The tale begins at a garden party in a lovely villa in the Azores held by Rogerio and Leonor for handsome, middle-aged Michel and his mistress Irene, a noted Greek movie star. The guests aren't there long before an obvious attraction between Leonor and Michel prompts them to head for a private beach (their tryst, if there was one, occurs off-camera). Five years later, the foursome again meet for a garden party and once again they pair off after spending much time discussing gender differences, emotion, social insight and exchanging witty bon mots.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6Ojyw72rS18eWGal6jHmYSeurMR.jpg", "actors": ["Michel Piccoli (Michel)", "Irene Papas (Irene)", "Leonor Silveira (Leonor)", "Rog\u00e9rio Samora (Rog\u00e9rio)", "Sofia Alves (Rapariga)", "Ricardo Tr\u00eapa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
