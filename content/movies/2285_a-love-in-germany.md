He wants to discover what happened then, the truth about an affair his mother had with a young Polish prisoner of war, how the authorities came to learn of it, the lovers' arrest, and the aftermath. While his son takes Polaroid photographs, he retraces the steps of his childhood and interviews those who should remember. The story is disclosed in flashbacks that focus on the lovers (Paulina and Stanislaus), on a jealous and conniving neighbor, and on Mayer, the local SS commander who wants to find a way out of inevitable consequences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e7UlyH4bza9fT7nptDXeXdeASLr.jpg", "actors": ["Hanna Schygulla (Pauline Kropp)", "Piotr \u0141ysak (Stanislaus)", "Armin Mueller-Stahl (Mayer)", "Ralf Wolter (Schulze)", "Daniel Olbrychski (Wiktorczyk)", "Bernhard Wicki (Dr. Borg)", "G\u00e9rard Desarthe (Karl Wyler)", "Elisabeth Trissenaar (Elisabeth Schnittgens)", "Sigfrit Steiner (Melchior)", "Erika Wackernagel (Frau Melchior)", "Ben Becker (Klaus)", "Otto Sander (Narrator)", "Friedrich G.
