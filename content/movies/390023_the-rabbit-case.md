His series of odd court cases reveals more about the human condition than about law. In one of these litigations a wayward nephew has cheated his elderly aunt out of her savings. In court, the nephew insists the money was a gift, but his aunt explains she only gave him the money as a loan. Although the lawyer technically wins the case, everything of value seems lost in the meantime. His services are paid for in rabbits because the aunt has no currency, and in the end, the nephew cons his aunt into parting with her savings anyway. Other cases expose similar types of petty corruption.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gr3MLAG4rV5uIVQmxF8wH0lUHlj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
