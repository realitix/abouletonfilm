Starting with Robert Louis Stevenson's nightmare in September 1885, Rankin traces the roots of this story, which stretches back to Stevenson's childhood. Grave-robbers, hallucinatory drugs and prostitution all play their part in the disturbing account of Henry Jekyll's double-life, as Rankin's journey takes him into the yeasty draughts and unlit closes of the city that inspired the tale - Edinburgh.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2IGH31TAVOKKuH7QPWSjlLCUdeH.jpg", "actors": ["Ian Rankin (Presenter/Himself)", "Ewen Bremner (R.L.
