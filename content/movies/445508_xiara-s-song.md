Though she seems happy hanging out and playing with her pal Melissa, Xiara becomes defensive and emotional when talking about her father, Harold Linares.  As we see and learn, Harold is in jail serving a ten-year sentence for weapons possession; Xiara seems to blame his incarceration on her mother, whom she says \"kept calling the police.\" Xiara, who has always been extremely close to her father, acts out with her mother.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qN1roVNOsSJUuSe6JqUpkGxrZve.jpg", "actors": ["Xiara Trujillo (Herself)", "Aracelli Guzman (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
