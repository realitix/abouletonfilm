Haas and his film crew follow Cyprien as he first paints and then takes part in the ceremony to open a new temple. The paintings include three vodun figures and several emblems, including a pipe and a duck. Cyprien explains his work in the context of the religion and takes the crew to film two other local ceremonies, one where the dead are believed to come back to instruct the living through wild dancing and, another, where women warriors perform their war dances.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sbabZgVIQuTGHhO1MBl77AYJkGd.jpg", "actors": ["Cyprien Tokoudagba (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
