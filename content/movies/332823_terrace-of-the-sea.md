An anthropologist, author (her most recent book is \"Refugees of the Revolution: Experiences of Palestinian Exile) and filmmaker, Diana Allan documents the experiences of the Ibrahim family, who have been making a living as fishermen for generations. The film looks at their relationship to work and to the physical environment and how they've persevered in this \u2018temporary' home.  Produced at Harvard's Sensory Ethnography Lab, Terrace of the Sea is a haunting work, a meditation on the process of memory and on the distances between photography and film, land and sea and - between seeing and being seen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pmIZ4NS9gNeuWjIuN2Chdydp4Vb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
