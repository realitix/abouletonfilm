Former Tarzan Gordon Scott sucks in his gut for this one. Professor Carmichael has developed a death ray \"for peaceful purposes only\" but a vague group of bad guys want it instead, so he's kidnapped by doughy guys and taken to their toy sub (via a toy helicopter)Bart Fargo must rescue him cause he's the only American spy who looks good in womanly sunglasses. Cool music accompanies him as he searches for Carmichael while he must deal with evil Abe Lincolns, a fey bad guy tuned friend of Fargo's and a couple of women who he must sleep with. In the end the ineffective bad guy gets killed, the professor and the death ray get rescued and Bart gets the woman. There's also a complex scene with a watch thrown in a pool which symbolizes the amount of time that was wasted on smart screen writing for the movie.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b1LHjeRiQXqjwYivGCZeMoNcN7j.jpg", "actors": ["Gordon Scott (Bart Fargo)", "Delfi Mauro (Lucille (as Maureen Delphy))", "Nello Pazzafini (Frank)", "Alberto Dalb\u00e9s (Carver)", "Silvia Solar (Mrs. Carver)", "Massimo Righi (Al)", "Tullio Altamura (Prof. John Carmichael)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [278758, 198558, 315379, 20053], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
