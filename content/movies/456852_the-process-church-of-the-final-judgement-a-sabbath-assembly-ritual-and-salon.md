About 50% of the video is the ritual itself, consisting of recitations from their unique liturgy interspersed with vintage hymns.  The text is read by original Process minister Sammy M Nasr and the songs are performed here by the band Sabbath Assembly (Jex Thoth, Imaad Wasif, Kevin Rutmanis and Dave Nuss - obviously taking their name from the ceremony itself).  Following the ritual is a slideshow presentation on the church narrated by original Process member/author Timothy Wyllie and finally a Q&A interview with Timothy conducted by Feral House publisher Adam Parfrey.  So while it's not a documentary exactly, you certainly learn about the history of the church, its practices, and get a good feel of what it was like to be a member.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p72gvqm2kNfoG908luZHmUqO0Al.jpg", "actors": ["Jex Thoth (Herself)", "Imaad Wasif (Himself)", "Kevin Rutmanis (Himself)", "Dave Nuss (Himself)", "Timothy Wyllie (Himself)", "Adam Parfrey (Himself)", "Sammy Nasr ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
