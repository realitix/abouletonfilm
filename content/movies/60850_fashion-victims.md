When Wolfi loses his drivers license in his brand-new Mercedes but can't afford to lose the season's sales because his frustrated wife (Franziska Walser) desperately wants a new bathroom, their son's vacation plans take a back seat as Karsten (Florian Bartholom\u00e4i) is forced to making sales rounds with his father instead of celebrating his high school graduation in Spain. Also making the rounds in small town southern Germany is successful and attractive sales rival Steven Brookm\u00fcller (Roman Knizka), 33. As the men's paths cross, long-hidden secrets are revealed and things come to a hilarious head.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/goMyQXtDIBbPPv0MFCNFRqwH3yZ.jpg", "actors": ["Edgar Selge (Wolfgang Zenker)", "Florian Bartholom\u00e4i (Karsten Zenker)", "Roman Knizka (Steven Brookm\u00fcller)", "Franziska Walser (Erika Zenker)", "Traute Hoess (Brigitta)", "Horst Krause (Horst)", "Gottfried Breitfuss (Polizist Gerhardt)", "Lara Beckmann (Lucie)", "Janna Wangenbach (Nicola)", "Jessica Schwarz (Frau Pfeiffer)", "Irm Hermann (Frau Retzlaff)", "Eva L\u00f6bau (Frau Rinne)", "Elert Bode (Herr Schiller)", "Susanna Fernandes-Genebra (Frau Hellberg)", "Sabine Hollweck (Endverbraucherin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [76956, 26423, 61072, 46755], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
