Funds are not forthcoming. Goundamani assures him that with his employer's help Kannan's dream could become a reality. But Goundamani is disappointed when his employer, the wealthy landlady's (Manorama) grandson Raghu (Ranjith) turns out to be money minded and heartless. In a fit of anger, Goundamani pushes him into the waters of a river and thinks he has committed a murder. Predictably Kannan is made to enter the scene as an impostor. What follows next forms the crux of the story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uD9Ss2zk3F8Ya8N3Bhyut0EJom1.jpg", "actors": ["Karthik Muthuraman ()", "Divyaa Unni ()", "Raasi ()", "Goundamani ()", "Manorama ()", "Senthil ()", "Ranjith ()", "Soori ()", "Vichu Vishwanath ()", "Balu Anand ()", "Kazan Khan ()", "Radha Ravi ()", "Mayilsamy ()", "K.
