In fact, he devotes himself to a bohemian life, preferring the popular fairs and pretty women, especially Alice, a seamstress from the Castelinhos quarter, which rather upsets her ambitious father, tailor Caetano, who is familiar with Vasco's debts. After failing yet another final exam, he is surprised by his aunts' announcement that they will visit him in Lisbon to see his practice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sH0d4sfbwG1wofS6MdM3CxIq31I.jpg", "actors": ["Vasco Santana (Vasco Leit\u00e3o)", "Beatriz Costa (Alice)", "Ant\u00f3nio Silva (Caetano)", "Teresa Gomes (Eug\u00e9nia)", "Sof\u00eda Santos (Maria Perp\u00e9tua)", "Alfredo Silva (Sapateiro)", "Ana Mar\u00eda (Maria da Gra\u00e7a)", "Manoel de Oliveira (Carlos)", "Eduardo Fernandes (Quincas)", "Manuel Santos Carvalho (dono do retiro de fados)", "Silvestre Alegrim (empregado do retiro)", "Maria Albertina (fadista)", "Henrique Alves ()", "Artur Rodrigues ()", "J\u00falia da Assun\u00e7\u00e3o ()", "Fernanda Campos ()", "Zizi Cosme ()", "Francisco Costa ()", "Elvira Coutinho ()", "Maria da Luz ()", "Coralia Escobar ()", "Ivone Fernandes ()", "Jos\u00e9 Victor (an examination professor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [74717, 97110, 79128, 74718], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
