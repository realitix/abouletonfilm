After losing badly to the Eagles, many of the players leave, and the team now has only eight players, one too few to play a game.  Going against his principles, the main character Harumaki Shunpei decides to buy a baseball robot. However, since he does not have enough money, he ends up buying the maid robot named Azusa. Even though Azusa has a warm heart and strong determination, it doesn't appear that she stands a chance against her adversaries who were top-of-the-line baseball robots. The team's only hope seems to lie in a secret buried within Azusa's clouded past.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1FT824zOrt3nryje4z6ys985w9b.jpg", "actors": ["Mamiko Noto (Azusa)", "Sayuri Anzu (Super Azusa)", "Yuuki Tai (Harumaki Shunpei)", "Daisuke Kishio (Hanashima Wataru)", "Fumito Yamano (Temple Reverend)", "Hiroki Shimowada (Tanabe)", "Hiroshi Shirokuma (Judge)", "Hajime Iijima (Harada)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
