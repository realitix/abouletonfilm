Richard, a 10-year-old boy who lives with his grandparents, has an attachment to a soccer ball as if it were his best friend. Every where Richard goes, so goes the ball. As time progresses, the ball develops different blemishes as a result of their activities together. We are reminded that inanimate objects can have memories as well; maybe just in the form of a scratch.
