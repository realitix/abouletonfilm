There\u2019s always music in it. When I was asked by some critics at a festival press conference what the film was all about, I said 'it\u2019s about the song All Along The Watchtower, and the film is about what happens and what changes depending on whether the song is sung by Bob Dylan or by Jimi Hendrix.'\" Well, both versions of the song appear in the film, and everybody thought I was pretty arrogant to explain the story this way. But the film really is about the difference between the Dylan version of All Along the Watchtower, and the Jimi Hendrix Version. One is at the beginning and one is at the end.\" \u2013 Wim Wenders", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rL1uAGNbRvAm38VhCm30iSUP11c.jpg", "actors": ["Werner Schroeter ()", "King Ampaw ()", "Christian Friedel ()", "Norbert Losch ()", "Paul Lys ()", "Peter Kaiser ()", "Christian Thiele ()", "Muriel Werner ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
