While predominantly looking at its use in the United States, the filmmaker takes us on a journey around the world to look at the magic of neon.  The documentary describes the initial public perception of neon as a glimpse into the future, it's use in film and art, as well as the changing impact that neon has had throughout the 20th century.  A wonderful documentary that will change the way you look at the colourful city lights."}], "recommandations_id": [333319, 118491, 217057, 344753]}
