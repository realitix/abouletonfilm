This is doubtless because it offers a total symbiosis of music, text and movement \u2013 described by the critic of the Daily Telegraph of London as being \u2018as close to the perfect dance opera as I have ever seen\u2019. Or to quote Gilles Macassar in T\u00e9l\u00e9rama: \u2018In the pit and onstage, the Brussels production has only one watchword: mobility, nimbleness, dexterity. The singers run, fly, whirl like dancers defying gravity. From the flies down to the footlights, the whole theatre is under a fantastic spell.\u2019 For Christophe Vetter, on ConcertoNet: \u2018This Orfeo can be seen again and again with immense pleasure. . . . Ren\u00e9 Jacobs\u2019s conducting continues to arouse admiration for its precision, its stylistic rigour, its inexhaustible inventiveness and its feeling for the contrasts so vital to this repertoire.\u2019", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oe8knMJe3RklWhhq7gl8qBLGcTf.jpg", "actors": ["Simon Keenlyside (Orfeo)", "Juanita Lascarro (Eirodoce / La Musica / Eco)", "Graciela Oddone (Messagiera)", "Martina Dike (Proserpina / Ninfe)", "Stephen Wallace (La Speranza / Pastori / Spiriti)", "T\u00f3mas T\u00f3masson (Plutone)", "Paul G\u00e9rimon (Caronte / Pastori / Spiriti)", "Mauro Utzeri (Apollo)", "Anne Cambier (Ninfe)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
