A fall means splashing into 80 degree water, drying off and trying again - from the bottom. Some call it climbing in its purest form. Others call it a hell of a way to spend a few weeks. Last season, a small group of climbers traveled to those sea cliffs to learn the intricacies of deep water soloing and to try, unrehearsed, some of the hardest - and most aesthetic - routes in the world. Directed and produced by Mike Call, Perfecto captures the beauty, adrenaline and purity of the Mallorca experience.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hd7Yo66Xhk2utoB7etaVP7IJMCm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
