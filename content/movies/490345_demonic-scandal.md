There, one of the nurses, who tries on the necklace, dies immediately. The necklace\u2019s hold on Katri then continues once she has healed; Katri becomes a slave to the spirit of Ellen Morgan. Andika (Johan Saimima) and Sion (Emri Margono), the doctors who are treating and monitoring the condition of Katri begin to suspect that the necklace has some kind of power over Katri, and they try to help her.
