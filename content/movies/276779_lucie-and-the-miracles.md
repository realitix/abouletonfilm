Lucy's fondest wish is to find new parents and leave an orphanage. She befriends a man who can create doors from paint. He gives her a stuffed dog that magically comes alive when placed on the ground, and he and his wife end up adopting the little girl. After finding parents of her own, Lucy sets out through fantasy to find parents for her orphan friends. All of the people Lucy meet during her remarkable make believe wanderings end up taking children home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2o6f5erymqGJWOHWauQXDBUPUwd.jpg", "actors": ["Viktorie \u010cerm\u00e1kov\u00e1 (Lucie)", "Na\u010fa Urb\u00e1nkov\u00e1 (Petra)", "Karel Kmoch (Cashier)", "Jan T\u0159\u00edska (Mikul\u00e1\u0161)", "Regina R\u00e1zlov\u00e1 ()", "Bohu\u0161 Z\u00e1horsk\u00fd ()", "Helena R\u016f\u017ei\u010dkov\u00e1 ()", "Ji\u0159\u00ed Str\u00e1nsk\u00fd ()", "Leo\u0161 Sucha\u0159\u00edpa ()", "Jaroslav Tomsa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
