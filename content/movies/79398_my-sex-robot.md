Some of us are drawn to red hair, some to big noses, while others can't get enough of a gap-toothed smile. Then are the more unusual attractions. Some people are attracted to robots. They don't just like robots \u2013 they love robots. They want to make love to robots. And some people want to help them. My Sex Robot follows three robot fetishists in their quest to find a futuristic lover, and the engineers who believe they could make their dreams come true. Robot fetishists are a little understood subculture, but in this film they talk openly about their desire for a mechanical lover: for one who'll give sex on demand, never answers back, and doesn't expect a cuddle. There are a few giggle-behind-your-hand-moments but once you're past the playground desire to point and laugh at anyone a bit different, it's engrossing stuff.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4FbG2NRHI4Leij1ZGd5rXSc7Mi3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
