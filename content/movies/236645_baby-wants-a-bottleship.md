Popeye carves a sailboat for him, but the tyke spots Popeye's battleship, and the puny toy boat will no longer do. He climbs aboard, and there's the expected mayhem. Notable sequences include a stint on the ship's cannon's control board, with Popeye caught on the barrel, then in the gears; also, at the end, Swee'Pea hitches a ride atop a torpedo just as Olive is returning and Popeye's out cold.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nfHJ6IclcYSLqUSNFKtXvW3X3zz.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Mercer (Popeye)", "Margie Hines (Olive Oyl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
