When a cyclone blows Strawberry to Oz, she runs afoul of a Wicked Witch and must journey to the Emerald City to ask the Wizard for help getting home. With her faithful dog Pupcake by her side, Strawberry meets Ginger Snap as the Scarecrow, Peppermint Fizz as the Tin Woodsgirl, and Orange Blossom as the Cowardly Lion. After making a big impression down the Berry Brick Road, the Munchkin-like Berrykins call on Strawberry and her friends to save the Gem-Berries whose glow lights the whole land of Oz.
