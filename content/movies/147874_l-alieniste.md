As usual, the director exploits all cinematic constituents in his palette \u2013 a radically intrusive and discordant soundtrack, non sequitur editing, exaggerated camera angles and all manner of carnivalesque pageantry \u2013 to illustrate the tale of a doctor/priest on a mission to discover truth through the study of madness. The population of his asylum grows as his definition of sanity fluctuates until it finally threatens to incorporate the entire town. The film\u2019s own irrational reversals and allegorical codes gleefully mock the arbitrariness of authoritarianism in all its varied guises. -Harvard Film Archive", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/237bKKD8Em23w6sGrNWLjSHMpIh.jpg", "actors": ["Nildo Parente (Sim\u00e3o Bacamarte)", "Isabel Ribeiro (D.
