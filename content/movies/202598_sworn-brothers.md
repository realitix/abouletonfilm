Lau (Andy Lau) is a fast-rising enforcer with the triads, but beneath his \"bad\" exterior is the sworn brother of Cheung (Cheung Kwok Keung), a Royal Hong Kong Police officer just returned from Scotland Yard. The two men are on opposite sides of the law, but both share a bond that cannot be tarnished, either by years or differing ideologies. Can the brotherhood of these two righteous men set things right in the underworld? Co-starring Tung Piu (Jackie Chan's Police Story films) in a compelling role as a corrupt cop, and loaded with many exciting actions sequences, Sworn Brothers is a standout triad action-drama in a genre already loaded with many similar films. With potent melodrama, and the type of heightened emotions that typify many popular eighties Hong Kong films, Sworn Brothers hits the action-drama bulls-eye in entertaining and bloody style!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iTg2CPc3qh1szWA2lPOduYiU0mS.jpg", "actors": ["Andy Lau (Lam Ting Yat)", "Bill Tung (Uncle Pao)", "Eddy Ko (Chan Chung Hon)", "Chin Ka-Lok (Ga Lo)", "Cheung Kwok-Keung (Inspector Kuo)", "Wong Chi-Keung (Fat Kao Wei)", "Pauline Wong Yuk-Wan (Yang Li Chui)", "Peter Yang Kwan (Yang Tung Hai)", "Ka Lee (Chen Guo)", "Shum Lo (Chui's father-in-law)", "Lui Tat ()", "Kan Tat-Wah (Sgt.
