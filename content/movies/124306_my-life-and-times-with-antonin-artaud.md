Over ten months, we follow the mad Artaud from his cruel coaching of an actress in his \"theatre of cruelty\" to his semi-friendship with Prevel who buys him drugs and hangs on his every word. Meanwhile, Prevel divides his time between Jany, his blond, young, drug-hazed mistress, and Rolande, his dark-haired, long-suffering wife, who has a child during this time. Cruelty, neglect, poverty, egoism, madness, and the pursuit of art mix on the Left Bank.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4KhSvrn9FPxQdyYShLAK6MwRKu3.jpg", "actors": ["Sami Frey (Antonin Artaud)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
