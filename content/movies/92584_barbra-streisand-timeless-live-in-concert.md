It opens with a dramatization of her first, amateur recording session, with young Lauren Frost playing a part described in the credits as \"Young Girl,\" though Streisand later refers to her as \"mini-me.\" Frost doesn't get too far before being joined by Streisand herself on a stirring version of \"Something's Coming\" from West Side Story. The rest of \"Act One\" traces Streisand's career from her club days to her movie performances. \"Act Two\" has less of a narrative structure, though it is equally autobiographical, with Streisand displaying and commenting on videos of herself performing with other stars and building up to the stroke of midnight with a combination of old, recent, and new specially written songs. At 57 that night, Streisand remains in good voice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5dDcY4RNi8Jhpx3xDszyK3Wols.jpg", "actors": ["Barbra Streisand (Herself)", "Randee Heller (Mother)", "Lauren Frost (Young Barbra)", "Shirley MacLaine (Herself)", "Savion Glover (Brother Time)", "Alec Ledd (Piano Player)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
