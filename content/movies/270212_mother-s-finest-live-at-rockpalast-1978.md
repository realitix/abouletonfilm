The sets are full of lively pieces that capatures the electrifying excitement and fun the band creates in concert. The two separate sets also define the length of time between the two events as the Rockpalast changed locations and as the band grew older and a few bandmember changes are obvious. The concerts are high powered and the footage is remarkable,Mothers Finest at it's mighty best!!!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s8FxPzu1XoYOqlKsXYFWQh56K3D.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
