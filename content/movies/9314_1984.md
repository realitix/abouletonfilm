Some of the details were:\r\n\r\n(1) Continual surveillance, in this case carried out by cameras hidden inside television sets.\r\n\r\n(2) Decaying infrastructure and shoddy merchandise produced by the Party's monopoly of the economy.\r\n\r\n(3) A political language, NewSpeak, full of euphemisms and code words for the government's activities.\r\n\r\n(4) A brutal law-enforcement system in which being suspected even of disloyal THOUGHTS can bring barbaric punishment.\r\n\r\nThe movie stars John Hurt as the beaten rebel, Susanna Hamilton as his mistress, and Richard Burton as the government official on whom they pin their hopes  (like Orwell himself,  Burton was fatally ill during the production and died before the movie's release)"}], "recommandations_id": [10803, 12101, 811, 4437], "youtube_key": "UEQnp_jdhiI"}
