Despite discouragement from her family, Walaa applies - and gets in. But her own rebellious behavior and a complicated relationship with her mother are a challenge, as are the circumstances under which she  lives. Following Walaa from 15 to 21, this first-ever look inside the Palestinian police academy brings us the story of a young woman navigating formidable obstacles, learning which rules to break and follow, and disproving the negative predictions from her surroundings and the world at large.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5SiXqObK18iVPVSxFOTJCElODwh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "259509687"}
