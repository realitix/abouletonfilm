The goofiness starts as knight Sir Carolboomer sends his clumsy servant, Hollyberry, to steal the Christmas wish list of his hard-to-please love interest, Princess Silverbelle, but ends up with the answers to a crossword puzzle instead. Bolstered by bouncy musical numbers and the vocal talents of Phil Hartman and Larry Kenney, the cartoon makes for family-friendly holiday fun.  An original story by the writer of Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oYGm9h5nJ79ocfDZuA3WjiP3GM5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
