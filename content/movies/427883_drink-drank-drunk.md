Gal pal Wendy gets things rolling with plans for a night of non-stop partying. Alan's lawyer knows his client's unreliability, so he pressures Alan's dependable chum Chris to tag along. Chris's friend Sam, an entrepreneur eager to do business with Alan's crowd, also joins in for fun and profit. As they make the rounds, Alan gets increasingly plastered while searching for his latest infatuation, Ayaka. By sunrise, he's hardly in condition to testify and even the hangover-curing skills of bartender Cherry prove ineffective. As the deadline looms, another solution is sought. In the process, the guys discover their twilight craziness provided each with a new self-perspective that has intangibly changed their lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t1t1mFPIMm5wLMbcaf3KtBHi10E.jpg", "actors": ["Carlos Chan (Alan)", "Ken Hung (Chris)", "Deep Ng (Sam)", "Michelle Wai (Wendy)", "Kathy Yuen (Cherry)", "Felix Lok Ying-Kwan ()", "Lee Kin-Yan ()", "Wan Chiu ()", "Maggie Siu ()", "Rock Ji ()", "Ayaka Tomoda (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "6FQxPacvC0U"}
