The crusty old Private Eye who was in love with her. A smooth-talking seductress who hires him to solve the crime. A bulldog detective with a nose for the truth and a leash held by city hall. A long list of suspects with a long list of alibis. A sprinkling of dirty secrets. A zest of clever lies. These are the ingredients of an homage to the PI films of Hollywood's Golden Age.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7Osd2F8jLyHbdQjhac6u9ifd4W3.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Atha (Louis Pendergrass)", "Mark Bramhall (Jefferson Sinclair)", "Ken Butler (Det.
