However, in the attempt to fly to Hawaii, Gilligan falls out and has to parachute down to the island. Against their better judgment, the gang decides to return the island to get him. In a stroke of luck, that saves their lives as an engine collapses upon landing instead of in midair. Even better, a U.S. Navy captain appears saying that their plane was detected on radar long enough for them to follow it to the island. A year later, the island is now a tropical resort spot fully linked to Civilization, and the castaways work as the staff as they work to entertain the various guests they receive.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Bhq37ngqWFGetF94KiWfXL85rK.jpg", "actors": ["Bob Denver (gilligan)", "Alan Hale Jr. (Skipper Jonas Grumby)", "Jim Backus (Thurston Howell III)", "Natalie Schafer (Lovey Wentworth Howell)", "Judith Baldwin (Ginger Grant)", "Russell Johnson (Prof. Roy Hinkley Jr.)", "Dawn Wells (Mary Ann Summers)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
