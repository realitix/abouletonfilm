The German authorities, who were financing the film, began to fear that these delays would have a negative impact on the future commercial success of the two Olympia films and so it was decided to create a promotional film, in English and in French, in order to maintain public interest for the film.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
