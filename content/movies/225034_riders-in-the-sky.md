He looks for the three witnesses who can testify that Lawson shot only in self defense in killing a gambler, but the witnesses are terrorized by another gambler, town boss Rock McCleary, who shoots witness Pop Roberts Morgan. Fatally wounded, Pop gives Gene the information needed to clear Lawson, then dies crying the \"Ghost Riders\" are coming for him. Gene then heads for a showdown with McCleary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kjzxrBsqXHhUvHmNytLATEZEuoG.jpg", "actors": ["Gene Autry (Gene Autry)", "Champion (Champ, Gene's Horse)", "Gloria Henry (Anne Lawson)", "Pat Buttram ('Chuckwalla')", "Mary Beth Hughes (Julie Stewart)", "Robert Livingston ('Rock' McCleary)", "Steve Darrell (Ralph Lawson)", "Alan Hale Jr. (Marshal Riggs)", "Tom London (Old Man Robert)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "OKtwllIhz2c"}
