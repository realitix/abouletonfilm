As the title of the work suggests, the journey also takes us back in time. Gliding over the surface of the planet, we look down and see historic architectural styles fly by - the exuberant Socialist Classicism, aka Stalinist Empire, the austere and brutish Soviet Modernism, and the hodgepodge of contemporary knock-offs and revivals of the styles of the past. An essential companion to this journey through time and space are Hymnic Variations on the Soviet anthem.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2sW1ojyrQXzAaVagMxGAHW6rPEo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
