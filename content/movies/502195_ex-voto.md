In the continuation of the contemplation of my homeland, I felt the need to come closer to the elemental of life and survival. So I went with the camera through my country and have taken everything that has happened to me. While working, I realized that the film is a reflection of my own spiritual needs. I've been trying to find an answer, to become aware of what my elemental sensations are that I believe are not different with my fellow human beings.\"-Langjahr", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7MnrZVz8dFzLvfzrDYxmezXPYqM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
