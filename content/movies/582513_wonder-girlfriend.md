So he gets drunk and wishes upon a star ... just as a spaceship is flying overhead, and an alien buzzes out and follows him home. Using his comic drawings on the walls as a guide, the alien assumes human form (to become Jacqueline Law) and calls herself Mah-Hey. Girlfriend gets understandably upset and walks out. Artist and Mah-Hey get jobs in a new firm, where she gives him support and help to succeed where he failed before. In between, Mah-Hey drinks water by the large bucketload, occasionally helps artist win fights, and looks into his dreams while he sleeps.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Simon Lui ()", "Jacqueline Law ()", "Ka-Lok ()", "Carol Lee Yee-Ha ()", "Lo Hoi-Pang ()", "Tung-kim Hung ()", "Kent Got ()", "Fung Yiu-Gei ()", "Yiu Kai-Chung ()", "Yu Ngai-Ho ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
