It's an amazing spectacle of late 80's/early 90's indie-music icons. KMFDM's En Esch, Revco/Ministry's Chris Connelly, Nine Inch Nails creator Trent Reznor, Mary Biker, William Tucker (RIP), Raven (Prong/Killing Joke), Andrew Weiss (Rollins Band/Ween), Danny Carey (Tool), and leader-slash-drummer Martin Atkins (Public Image Ltd./Ministry/Killing Joke) keep this video spinning with their over-the-top antics and Spinal Tap-ish tour foibles. This should be in your video collection between the Who's \"\"The Kid's Are Alright\"\" and Dave Markey's \"\"1991: The Year Punk Broke.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
