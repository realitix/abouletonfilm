It begins with Chantal\u2019s escape to Berlin from the confines of a small country town in southwest Germany in 1980. Interweaving interviews and portraits, but also on- and off-stage stories, backstage gossip, copious amounts of music and excerpts from her shows, the film allows Chantal\u2019s story to unfold before a backdrop of recent and very recent history. House of Shame takes us to the squats of Oranienstrasse of the early 1980s; to Martin Kippenberger\u2019s newly founded club \u2018SO36\u2019; to the studios of the artists of the \u2018Neuen Wilden\u2019 movement, and the epicentre of gay emancipation. The film also takes a look at the lives and deaths of transsexuals. No amount of colourful parades and riotous parties can conceal the fault lines in a personality: a body can thwart everything and lead to apartheid among sex workers, in bars and even in everyday professional life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fj6xzG9yjHv3QJzJsEvF45nE5C1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
