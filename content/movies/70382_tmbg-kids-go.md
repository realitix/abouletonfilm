Called to action by the words Hey, kid! a tired-looking boy and girl are encouraged to stand up, get up off the couch, [j]ump up off the floor and go/ Get up off your chair and go! go! go! Soon they're moving like a monkey, jumping like a jack-in-the-box, and getting a high-energy groove on (there's even a dance break). With just a hint of retro style about them, Campion's thick and loose black ink lines provide a sense of fluidity in riotous scenes that use a limited but appealing palette of green, gray, and peach, splashed over lots of white space.
