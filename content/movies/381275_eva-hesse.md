Her flowing forms were in part a reaction to the rigid structures of then-popular minimalism, a male-dominated movement. Hesse\u2019s complicated personal life encompassed not only a chaotic 1930s Germany, but also illness and the immigrant culture of New York in the 1940s. One of the twentieth century\u2019s most intriguing artists, she finally receives her due in this film, an emotionally gripping journey with a gifted woman of great courage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/veuIYTtajv1IJgr3tKUGUGkniOI.jpg", "actors": ["Selma Blair (Eva Hesse (voice))", "Bob Balaban (Wilhelm Hesse (voice))", "Patrick Kennedy (Sol Lewitt (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "l2b8m9D0mK0"}
