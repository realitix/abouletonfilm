It shows the Nazi war criminal\u2019s last years in Argentina and the \u201cheroic search\u201d of the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency and a tragic love story: Romeo and Juliet of the twentieth century, a Nazi Romeo and a Jewish Juliet. Klaus is Adolf Eichmann\u2019s son and Silvia, the daughter of Lothar Hermann, a survivor of the Shoah.
