One night, Romeo, a Montague, crashes a party given by the Capulet's in order to meet up with a young woman called Rosaline, with whom he is infatuated. Thoughts of her vanish from his mind, however, when he catches sight of Juliet, daughter of the head of the Capulet household. Juliet is equally smitten with Romeo, but her father already has other plans for her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a8zPWWJfhZPGD8D7zzWoPQEua1x.jpg", "actors": ["Sara Farb (Juliet)", "Antoine Yared (Romeo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
