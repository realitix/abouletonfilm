The Colossus Of Destiny - A Melvins Tale is a film about a band who have defied all the rules, for over 32 years and counting, and still managed to succeed and do it their own way. The journey of band members King Buzzo and Dale Crover leads us from the backwards-waters of the Chehalis River in Washington State, down through the Golden Gate of Northern California, and finally settling into the Los Angeles River Basin of Southern California. With the rest of the world thrown in along the way. You will witness first hand the beliefs and attitudes, values and obscenities, slows and fasts, triumphs and toils, loves and hates, wits and giggles of a hugely talented and influential band. And you will also come away with a lesson in how to survive in the wicked world of the music biz without taking yourself too damn seriously.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wSK3l00L8USO5IUTt3LkuQv0J3k.jpg", "actors": ["Buzz Osborne ()", "Dale Crover ()", "Mike Dillard ()", "Trevor Dunn ()", "Jello Biafra ()", "Chris Cornell ()", "Tom Hazelmyer ()", "Mike Patton ()", "Kevin Rutmanis ()", "Gene Simmons ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
