The best thing about \"Office Girls\" is that Lisa is in it! Her style and sophistication make her a perfect business woman. Another great thing about this movie is that we get to see two real-life lovers having sex with each other (Helena and Nelly). All of the scenes are very nice, but two of them stand out: The scene with Helena and Nelly (a.k.a. Jackie) because you know it's for real, and the scene with Lisa and Kylie because of the very interesting set-up.  The movie begins with Vera having some fun with a copying machine. Then we see a conversation between Lisa, the office boss, and Stella Stevens, who wants a raise. Lisa tells her to come over to her apartment later that evening so they can continue discussing the possibility of a raise. When Stella gets home, she dresses up for the evening, and later she shows up at Lisa's apartment with a bottle of wine.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
