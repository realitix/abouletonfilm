A man walks toward the shore, looking for something. A bunch of illegal immigrants from northern Africa are hiding in the bushes. The man works for the local mobster exploiting the immigrants. They will work at a local mine as modern slaves. Among them is somebody who is not supposed to be there. Sometimes inner conflicts come to the surface. This is the moment to take a look where nobody does, where modern hypocrisy turns other humans into misfits, and not only people from the third world.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
