Soon after the wedding their only son Ashish (Amir Dalvi) flies back to Germany from where he had come only to attend his sister's wedding. The old couple is left alone in their big mansion in Delhi. A few days down the line it is revealed that Sujata is afflicted with multiple myeloma, a rare type of cancer. Somewhere in this city, there are four goons whose livelihood is to murder and loot hapless senior citizens in the city. They do this by pretending to be AC mechanics who offer free checks of ACs even when your AC could be working perfectly fine. Dilliwaalas open their doors to anybody who offers a free service. Then there are domestic servants and drivers who are hand-in-glove with the four criminals. This is not to say that such things do not happen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8LHM31C5uX08vftdDxoIxhBUBuF.jpg", "actors": ["Asif Basra ()", "Aamir Dalvi ()", "Darshan Jariwala ()", "Nina Kulkarni ()", "Yashpal Sharma ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "A4buVvzImhM"}
