Recorded live at the Royal Opera House, September 2013.  Andrei Serban's spectacular and thrilling 1984 production of Puccini's final and grandest opera has long been a classic at the Royal Opera House. First filmed for BBC TV in the 80s, this new recording \u2013 of its fifteenth revival \u2013 is in stunning HD and makes this famous production available for the first time on DVD and Blu-ray. The release will rightfully take its place alongside the outstanding Royal Opera Puccini DVDs of La Boh\u00e8me, Tosca (on EMI) and Trittico. American Lise Lindstrom is one of the very few contemporary Turandots who can genuinely sing this \u2018killer\u2019 role, and is supported by a touching Li\u00f9 from Japanese soprano Eri Nakamura and an unashamedly Italianite Calaf from Marco Berti. The young Hungarian conductor Henrik N\u00e1n\u00e1si directs the large orchestra and all-important chorus.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p0yauS9jRLKdrHoyjyjkwplmCt1.jpg", "actors": ["Lise Lindstrom (Princess Turandot)", "Marco Berti (Prince Calaf)", "Eri Nakamura (Li\u00f9)", "Raymond Aceto (Timur)", "Dionysis Sourbis (Ping)", "David Butt Philip (Pang)", "Douglas Jones (Pong)", "Alasdair Elliott (Emperor Altoum)", "Michel de Sousa (Mandarin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
