These haven't worked so far, and the bodies have been waxened and placed on display in the museum to cover his crimes. His big chance seems to come, however, when he learns that the mummified body of a modern man has been found in an Egyptian sarcophagus. The professor and his two henchmen steal the body and take it back to his lab - where the experiment flops again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pOaonn4psRhyPkF2amt5iKLK51X.jpg", "actors": ["Lon Chaney Jr. (The Mummified Werewolf)", "Germ\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s (Casimiro)", "Yolanda Varela (Paquita)", "Yerye Beirute (Professor Sebastian)", "Alfredo Wally Barr\u00f3n (Nacho)", "Agust\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez (Rito)", "\u00d3scar Ortiz de Pinedo (Dr. Lorenzo Salazar)", "Consuelo Guerrero de Luna (Dr. Salazar's Patient)", "Rafael Estrada (Professor Estrada)", "Dacia Gonz\u00e1lez (Mesera)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [107298], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
