Their everyday life is determined by an attempt to ward off everything modern, a life without electricity, machines and communicative media, a school whose only books are the Bible and the Catechism. Nora Fingscheidt takes this life in the eye and lets it be told by those who live it - in different degrees of devotion. In the process, it is not least apparent how a life-style, which has devoted itself entirely to the departure from this \"world,\" is formed around it. And then, between the pictures and the words, a gap opens, in which the longing for a more destitute life, as well as the fear of a sad departure, becomes perceptible.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
