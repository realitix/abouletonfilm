A year ago in this town Laura, who looked just like Drew, was murdered. Everyone assumed that Laura's boyfriend Teddie who went missing at the same time as the murder had done it, but Drew starts having dream sequences and trances that imply otherwise. Gradually through investigation and with the guidance of more visions from Laura, Drew uncovers the story behind the murders.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3872d2wqCHerMz9LVafDczFL5cm.jpg", "actors": ["Candace Cameron Bure (Drew Summers / Laura Fairgate)", "Casper Van Dien (Teddy Johnson / Ray Ordwell - Jr.)", "Denis Arndt (Ray Ordwell - Sr.)", "Bobby Hosea (R.J.
