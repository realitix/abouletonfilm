The result is two remarkable documentaries: the first, NCR: Not Criminally Responsible, premiered at Hot Docs in the spring of 2013 and follows the story of a violent patient released into the community. The second film, Out of Mind, Out of Sight, returns to the Brockville Mental Health Centre to profile four patients, two men and two women, as they struggle to gain control over their lives so they can return to a society that often fears and demonizes them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gcCzIGFXD8HPzZUKfViurfSfwoo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "DUWTszWapDE"}
