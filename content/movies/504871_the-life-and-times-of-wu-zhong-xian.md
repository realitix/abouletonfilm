Based on a stage play, this DV feature traces the poignant trajectory of a rebel whose dream of world revolution first landed him in battles against British colonialism in the 70s, and later on his deathbed in the mid-90s, in agonies over the uncertain fate of a revitalized China. Revealing a little-known chapter of rebellion and idealism, THE LIFE AND TIMES OF WU ZHONG XIAN is a timely, resonant docu-drama for today's Hong Kong, China, and our ideologically-disillusioned era.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cAo7u6795H7kyvZQzXQutR4yfFf.jpg", "actors": ["Mok Chiu-Yu (Wu Zhongxian (Ng Chung-yin))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
