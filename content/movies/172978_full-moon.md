Murer wrote and directed this Swiss drama about a family with a missing child. The only explanation seems to be kidnapping, but no ransom note arrives. Police inspector Anatol Wasser (Hanspeter Muller) soon faces an elaborate mystery: a dozen Swiss children vanish with no indication of any pattern -- other than the fact that they all lived near lakes. Is organized crime responsible, or does the answer lie in mystical realms? Shown at the 1998 Montreal Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/21mz6uDdfjTDKaVdGwyQ05VRfOK.jpg", "actors": ["Hanspeter M\u00fcller (Anatol Wasser)", "Lilo Baur (Irene Escher)", "Benedict Freitag (Max Escher)", "Mariebelle Kuhn (Emmi Escher)", "Yolande Moreau (Marie Rochat)", "Angelika Bartsch (Ingeborg Gilardi-H\u00f6lzle)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
