That's what the short movies you could see in a peep machine were. For the cost of a few coins, a variety of beautiful babes romped around in the buff before your eyes. They weren't always glamorous, but they were always well-endowed. In the 1950s and 60s these little films were commonplace, but now they're part of a bygone era. This collection brings together over an hour of those short subjects in both black & white and color, with a special emphasis on \"going back to nature.\" By which we mean curvaceous pin-up models camping out in the woods. Usually, a little spilled coffee leads to them stripping down to their undies... and then nothing at all. (Hopefully, their spectacular rear ends didn't suffer any bug bites.) One thing's for sure, the gals who made these films had fun... and you will, too.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
