A newspaper reporter is working on a story about a criminal serving time in jail. He interviews the prisoner, has an affair with the criminal's daughter, and also spends some time in bed with his editor's wife. His amorous life is an adjunct to his searching out the details of the prisoner's case -- though tragedy strikes before the journalist can wrap everything up. In the meantime, it becomes clear that the daughter and imprisoned father had an incestuous relationship, raising more questions than answers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oMBgCPC5IBzeNG7s8tRAo6r9XIh.jpg", "actors": ["Jos\u00e9 Luis G\u00f3mez (Juan Oribe)", "Amparo Mu\u00f1oz (Clara)", "Patricia Adriani (Carmen)", "Francisco Casares (Paco)", "Luis Politti (Luis Falc\u00f3n)", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Peychayrand (Aurora (as Helene Peycherand))", "Claude Legros (Donato Est\u00e9vez (as Claude Legross))", "Marie Mansart (Josefina)", "Juan Jes\u00fas Valverde ((as Jose Valverde))", "Mar\u00eda Amezua (Chica del bar)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
