Potter's Museum, filled with his creations and collection of oddities and curiosities dazzled millions for over a hundred years until the collection's unfortunate separation in 2003. While largely about the man and his creations, the film also takes a look at the obsessive nature of collecting, as well as the controversial history of stuffing dead animals.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8sFtzZQXkAFcWKW0HqE9wokZndR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "BjHBpxIa45U"}
