They are best known for their groundbreaking contributions to architecture, furniture design, industrial design and manufacturing. The legacy of this husband and wife team includes more than 75 films that reflect the breadth and depth of their interests. All three films in Volume 3 grew out of the remarkable exhibition, \"The World of Franklin and Jefferson,\" designed by the Eames for the celebration of America's Bicentennial. The first film, \"The World of Franklin and Jefferson\" (1977, 35 min.), uses the lives of these two founding fathers as prisms through which to evoke colonial America. Also included on this volume: \"The Franklin and Jefferson Proposal Film\" (1973, 13 min.) and \"Paris: The Opening of an Exhibition\" (1976, 6 min.), showing the Paris opening of this incredible exhibit.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nz1CfF0A9buKNXHKtX6bZMHp2pq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
