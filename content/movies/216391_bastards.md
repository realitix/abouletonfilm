He unsuccessfully tries to adapt to the modern Russian savage life. The world around him lives by rules dictated by the black market and Chechen wars. It is a cruel and unjust world, where you can survive only with a bunch of stolen dollars instead of brains. For a young Russian, money is a symbol of power and strength. Even the new state ideology feeds on blood oil dollars. In Russia there is no more room for dreams. This is the era of anti-utopia.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/utex7K9DoLh220iidoX4JN9C71u.jpg", "actors": ["Elena Lapteva ()", "Egipetskii Mag ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
