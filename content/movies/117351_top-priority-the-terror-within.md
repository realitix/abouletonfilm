Customs and Border Protection Commissioner, former head of the DEA Robert Bonner can't afford any more media scrutiny, since his incompetence was already exposed in the NASA 'Challenger' disaster. To avoid the scandal, the full might of the government is unleashed against Julia Davis, her family and witnesses. This retaliation reaches an unprecedented magnitude, including four unexplained deaths, Hollywood and the Mafia, false imprisonments and the use of Blackhawk helicopters and airplanes for warrantless surveillance. Amidst many shocking revelations, this documentary provides a new insight into the deaths of well-known Hollywood figures unwittingly dragged into this scandal.  The truth is no longer a secret.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qm4wkExCyt2VkXwmn0qd5CZWDQS.jpg", "actors": ["Julia Davis (Herself - Former Customs and Border Protection Officer targeted)", "BJ Davis (Himself - Husband of Julia Davis targeted by the Department of Homeland Security)", "Herbert P.
