Addicted to their favorite new game (from which the film takes its title), these children have become seriously estranged from the real world. The film's constant emphasis is on the ways in which this has been allowed to happen, and on how emblematic it is of larger attitudes in a technological society. When a young boy trying to converse with his mother must compete with a home computer for her attention, it's not hard to see why the boy has retreated into his own computer-dominated world.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2TszIAf0PkAc5fSYMe9FmJpreb3.jpg", "actors": ["Ryo Takayama ()", "Neko Saito ()", "Nobuo Nakamura ()", "Issei Ogata ()", "Saeko Suzuki ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
