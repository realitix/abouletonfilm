Smighting is very much perturbed at this possible hindrance which threatens to upset his apparently successful land fraud, and he immediately convenes a caucus at the capitol of those legislators of his brand who can be \"approached\" for the ultimate motive of securing the passage of the bill. To doubly ensure the accomplishment of his desire, he enlists the services of his family, in that he instructs his daughter to exert her charm over the young Indian so as to possibly keep him away from the object of his visit.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mc6xjuIlI6zH8PsqbOeCsbBeio0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
