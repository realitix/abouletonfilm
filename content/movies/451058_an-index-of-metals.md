An Index of Metals bears vigorous witness to this determination to go beyond: sizzling orchestration, electric and psychedelic; a voice which plays on effects, murmurs with reverb, cackles into a megaphone, screams like a pop star; and an electric guitar score of a kind that no \u2018serious\u2019 composer has ever written, sliding across an infinite range of tones with a lightness of touch and blurring of contours.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4WWDb2kqz9ARIFeQHM2WgQVMYjp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
