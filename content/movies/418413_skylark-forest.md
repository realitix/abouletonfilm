Teaming up the ever-popular Misora Hibari with the greatest samurai action hero of all-time Wakayama Tomisaburo is a brilliant stoke of casting.  Hibari takes on the role of Mori no Ishimatsu, a young man who gets involved with real-life Yakuza legend, Shimizu no Jirocho, 'Boss of the Tokaido'. Ishimatsu manages to interfere with a dispute between the Shimizu and their competition, the Marugame family, even going so far as to become an avenger's assistant.  It's not the first time Hibari has played a man in a film (also in Benten Kozo), and her acting skills are at their best as she mixes in a bit of humor along with excellent swordplay.  Wakayama Tomisaburo, as always, gives an outstanding performance as the powerful and beloved Yakuza Boss Jirocho.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/raKfnQ6Q3m8vrLa4amz90RlY1yI.jpg", "actors": ["Tomisabur\u014d Wakayama ()", "Chie Ueki ()", "Hibari Misora ()", "Kunio Kaga ()", "Koinosuke Ogami ()", "Kusuo Abe ()", "Denjir\u00f4 \u00d4k\u00f4chi ()", "Kojiro Hongo ()", "Tamao Nakamura ()", "Raiz\u014d Ichikawa ()", "Sonosuke Sawamura ()", "Keiko Funabashi ()", "Takaaki Furuishi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
