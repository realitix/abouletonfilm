Shot in 2009-2012 (before and during the Egyptian revolution, and ending with the most recent presidential elections), the film explores the country's collective identity, inherent struggles, and the sentiments that lead through the historic changes taking place in Egypt today. For his third documentary, Egyptian/ American filmmaker Sherief Elkatsha rides through the congested streets alongside a diverse cast of characters-from taxi drivers to ambulances, from traffic cops to private citizens-capturing the unspoken codes of conduct, frustrations, humor, fatalism, and life-or-death decisions of driving in a city where the only rule is: there are no rules.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hl8s1nBtnFH21x9dAqZdg61AAhJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
