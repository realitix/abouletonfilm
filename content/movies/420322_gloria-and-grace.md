One day, in a visit to the doctor, Gra\u00e7a is diagnosed with a brain aneurism that may rupture at any moment. Desperate about who will take care of her kids in the event of her death, she decides to go after her brother, Luiz Carlos, whom she hasn't seen in over 15 years due to a quarrel. When they meet, however, Luiz Carlos has become Gloria, a beautiful and successful transvestite, who now owns a restaurant and brags about being independent. At first, Gloria is unwilling to reconnect with her family; but as she becomes more guilt-stricken, she accepts Gra\u00e7a's invitation to meet her nephews and eventually realizes that maybe, to be complete, she needs to become a mother.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uINrTkh87w9aOFiTq1SRahJQ9Ja.jpg", "actors": ["Carolina Ferraz (Gl\u00f3ria)", "Sandra Corveloni (Gra\u00e7a)", "Vicente Demori (Moreno)", "Carol Marra (Fedra)", "Vicente Monte (Vicente)", "C\u00e9sar Mello (Ot\u00e1vio)", "Roberto Maya (Dr. Eduardo)", "Gabriel Delfino (Saulo (barman))", "Marjorie Machi (Keila (gar\u00e7onete))", "Bruna Griph\u00e3o (Mariana)", "Gabriela Simoni (Cris)", "Katharina Furtado (Tha\u00edssa)", "Rog\u00e9rio Barros (Porteiro)", "Jo\u00e3o Langen (Gringo (restaurante de Gl\u00f3ria))", "Naura Schneider (Irene)", "Henrique Pires (Dr. Chagas)", "Nanda F\u00e9lix (M\u00e3e de Gra\u00e7a)", "Ludmilla Demori (Bruna (secret\u00e1ria de Gra\u00e7a))", "Felipe Oliveira (David (amigo de Ot\u00e1vio))", "Thomas Stavros (Advogado)", "Marcelo Marins (Garot\u00e3o procurando programa)", "Polly Marinho (Enfermeira)", "Rafael Boschi (Luiz Carlos menino)", "Andressa (Travesti 1 / Dubl\u00ea)", "Sarah Chimits (Travesti 2)", "Fabr\u00edcia Plattielli (Travesti 3)", "Luany (Travesti 4)", "Ricardo Richaldi (M\u00fasica 2 (baixo))", "Pedro Tambellini (M\u00fasico 3 (guitarra))", "Mikael de Albuquerque (Rafael (paciente de Gra\u00e7a))", "Rafael da Silva (Camel\u00f4)", "Sofia Marques (Papoula)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
