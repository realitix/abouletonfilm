He promises to improve his ways and is finally granted a few hours alone with his two children. They celebrate the reunion by going to the movies to see a new film by the famous, critically acclaimed Danish director Claus Volter. But the film is not the masterpiece it is said to be on the poster; the children are crying and Tony cannot get the money back he spent on tickets and candy. Tony does not give up; he seeks out Claus Volter in order to get an explanation and a refund. It is however easier said than done to get money out of a world-renowned filmmaker.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z4TYjt1MBd7Rz1gavRnvsA7OqEB.jpg", "actors": ["Ulrich Thomsen (Tonny)", "Nikolaj Lie Kaas (Claus Volter)", "Mille Dinesen (Pernille Jepsen)", "Line Kruse (Klara Kj\u00f8bmand)", "Lars Ranthe (Laust Hatling)", "Nicolaj Kopernikus (Jan Godtfredsen)", "Jakob Cedergren (Allan Henriksen)", "Lars Brygmann (Tim Holstein)", "Niels Olsen (Brormand)", "Peter Mygind (Tom Frej)", "Ellen Hillings\u00f8 (Tanja)", "Mette Agnete Horn (B\u00e6kkel)", "Ole Lemmeke (Christian)", "Lykke Sand Michelsen (The Realtor)", "Anette St\u00f8velb\u00e6k (Kira)", "Kristian Halken ()", "Michael Car\u00f8e ()", "Christian Heldbo Wienberg  ()", "Frederikke Thomassen ()", "Michael Asmussen ()", "Helge Scheuer ()", "Marie Caroline Schjeldal ()", "Benedicte Balling ()", "Kjeld N\u00f8rgaard ()", "Dan Schlosser ()", "Stephanie Le\u00f3n ()", "Hans Pilgaard ()", "Allan Olsen ()", "Caroline Boserup ()", "Tomas Villum Jensen ()", "Peter Reichhardt ()", "S\u00f8ren Frellesen ()", "Uffe Holm ()", "Mikkel Vadsholt ()", "Ditlev Arne Ulrichsen ()", "Anne Oppenhagen Pagh ()", "Poul Thomsen ()", "Preben Kristensen ()", "Nicolai Villum Jensen ()", "Joachim Knop ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [21273, 23294, 57193, 15965], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
