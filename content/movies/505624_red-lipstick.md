Starring, Hedda Lettuce and Miss Understood as a pair of none-too-glam dragqueens, down on their luck and living the low life in New York City circa 1992. A not particularly bright scheme to reinvent themselves as Bonnie and Bunny, bank robbers in daring frocks, rockets them to fame and finally gives them enough cash to hire a posh, Eastern European, interior decorator, specializing in rococo. But all is not feather boas and sequins. The envy of Brenda, bitchy Morticia Adams clone, and Violet, a whip-wielding dominatrix, scheme to ruin the party.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1UjfsByckiv0jjey1PXcc6UjSEt.jpg", "actors": ["Steven Polito ()", "Miss Understood ()", "Debbie Harry ()", "Jane Lynch ()", "Marc Geller ()", "James Lorinz ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
