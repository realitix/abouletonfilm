Meanwhile, having just ended his engagement to Eugenia Abbott and now looking for rest and relaxation, the wealthy Robert Stanley also becomes a boarder at the aunt's, and he and Dimples quickly fall in love. Then a stock market panic puts a severe strain on Robert's assets, and he must get a lot of cash in order to avoid a disaster. Dimples finds out, takes the money from the doll, gives it to Robert's broker and, as a result, saves her sweetheart's financial empire.
