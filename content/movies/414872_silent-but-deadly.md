Coyote is sitting in his cave reading a book about ninja fighting. He dresses up as a black ninja in an attempt to sneak into Road Runner's nest and eat him. When he gets to the nest, he grabs the Road Runner by the neck only to find out it was a decoy. The real Road Runner then arrives in a white ninja suit to fight the Coyote. Wile E. and Road Runner begin to fight with their new knowledge of martial arts, however, Wile E. isn't as good as he thought he was.
