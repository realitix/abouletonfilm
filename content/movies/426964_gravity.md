It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rj9CMoZQVrbxYMTbdSBPzNepIvj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
