Bogman is passionate about the threatened habitat of Scotland's Flow Country. But Bogman's early life and subsequent diagnosis as \"paranoid schizophrenic\" conditions his relationships with other people. Describing himself as \"the hidden cat\" and \"wild outlaw of paradise\", Bogman is taking legal action to remove the label \"paranoid schizophrenic\".
