Not only must Blondie Bumstead (Penny Singleton) put on a brave face when her husband Dagwood (Arthur Lake) is fired for the umpteenth time by Mr. Dithers (Jonathan Hale), but she must also tolerate the attentions paid to Dagwood by pretty WAC Mary Jane McDermott (Angelyn Orr).  A whiz in business matters, Mary Jane sets up Dag in his own business, which replenishes the Bumstead coffers but which drives Blondie into a jealous frenzy.  The film's highlight occurs early on, when Dagwood assumes Dithers' responsibilities for a single day--and makes a proper mess of things within five minutes.[", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hkoex0sBb5iC7DSvU9OpDWNHabV.jpg", "actors": ["Penny Singleton (Blondie Bumstead)", "Arthur Lake (Dagwood \" Dag \" Bumstead)", "Larry Simms (Alexander Bumstead)", "Marjorie Ann Mutchie (Cookie Bumstead)", "Daisy (Daisy)", "Bob Haymes (Jonathan \" Johnny \" Butler)", "Angelyn Orr (Sgt.
