It's a story based on a selection of key events occurring between the formation of the band and their appearance at Live Aid.\r\nAs a Queen fan I found this film utterly engrossing and enjoyable. The acting brilliantly invokes the characters in the band and the music provides a thumping rhythm to carry the story along.\r\nQueen aficionados may be affronted by the out of sequence music performances and the highly selective approach to the story telling but if you can see past that, you'll enjoy a storming film with a spine-tingling conclusion as the Live Aid performance is brilliantly recreated."}], "recommandations_id": [332562, 490132, 487558, 338952]}
