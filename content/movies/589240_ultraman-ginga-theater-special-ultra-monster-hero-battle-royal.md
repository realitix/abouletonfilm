Misuzu, Kenta and Chigusa discover several Spark Dolls, which were thought to be sent into outer space but somehow returned to Earth. Hikaru soon arrives, and soon the group are transported into a virtual room by Tomoya's Gunpad. The room itself has several Spark Dolls in its collection. Tomoya introduces them to the Livepad, a tablet which allows its user to use UltLive simulations by simply scanning the Spark Doll via the tip of its pointer pen. The group begins experimenting with the new technology.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yAJXuwlNl3wxlLWcC3qekfmqOdw.jpg", "actors": ["Takuya Negishi (Hikaru Raid\u014d)", "Mio Miyatake (Misuzu Isurugi)", "Mizuki Ohno (Kenta Watarai)", "Kirara (Chigusa Kuno)", "Takuya Kusakawa (Tomoya Ichij\u014dji)", "Masahiko Tsugawa (Hotsuma Raid\u014d)", "Hiroya Ishimaru (Ulltraman Taro (voice))", "Tomokazu Sugita (Ultraman Ginga (voice))", "Yoshihisa Kawahara (Ginga Spark/Livepad (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Joap7EmAtRA"}
