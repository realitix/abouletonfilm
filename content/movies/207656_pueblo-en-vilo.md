It's an ordinary town, with no special qualities. A Mexican writer, however, Luis Gonz\u00e1lez, who was born and died in the town, wrote a surprising book telling of the small occurrences in the village. The book was translated into several languages and became a classic text of \"microhistory\". The thesis is that everything that happens in a small town is a reflection, an echo, of what happens in the whole country... The film reconstructs the disperse memory of this community with the presence of Luis Gonz\u00e1lez and the other elders of this group of human size and without any particular hero.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
