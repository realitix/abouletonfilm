Watershed, not the Loire river! That is to say the inclined to the sea level, all of the irrigated area, not only the stroke of the river. That is to say, the business areas and wetlands, ditches and highways, meeting rooms and yards. Because water is everywhere, in soil, ground, air, flowing, seeping, evaporating and everywhere connecting the territories between them, indicating their interdependence, making us dream of solidarity.
