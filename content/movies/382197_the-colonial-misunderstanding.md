The film looks at Christian evangelism as the forerunner of European colonialism in Africa, indeed, as the ideological model for the relationship between North and South even today. In particular it looks at the role of missionaries in Namibia on the centenary of the 1904 German genocide of the Herero people there. It reveals how colonialism destroyed African beliefs and social systems and replaced them with European ones, as if they were the only acceptable routes to modernity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6X7uLXJAQfcbaK7Oui0eNT5wVNK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
