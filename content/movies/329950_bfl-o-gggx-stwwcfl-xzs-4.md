The screen goes black between each sketch. The narration is straightforward with the chimps providing comic, contradicting subtexts.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p40gZbktORm70KqDRXEg8JoDkvR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
