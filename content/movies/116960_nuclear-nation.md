With a clear and compassionate eye, filmmaker Atsushi Funahashi follows the displaced people as they struggle to adapt to their new environment. Among the vivid personalities who emerge are the town mayor, a Moses without a Promised Land; and a farmer who would rather defy the government than abandon his cows to certain starvation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kjnoVsMx04JrrLFCUDvneDNHMfT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
