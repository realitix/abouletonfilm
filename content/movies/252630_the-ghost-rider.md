Though the next three years featured Brown (as Nevada Jack McKenzie) and Hatton (in his Sandy Hopkins role from the Rough Riders series) as undercover marshals in some form or another, this initial entry had Brown as a lone rider seeking vengeance and he and Hatton's characters were unknown to each other through most of the film. Hopkins offer McKenzie a marshal's job at the end of the film, which the Brown character declined and rode off alone on his quest. This quest didn't take long as by the next film in the series Nevada Jack McKenzie was a full-fledged U. S. Marshal.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kQ7VhV30WorhA2aY5GhmgIQR24b.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Mack Brown (Nevada Jack McKenzie)", "Raymond Hatton (Marshal Sandy Hopkins)", "Harry Woods (Lash Edwards)", "Beverly Boyd (Julie Wilson)", "Tom Seidel (Joe McNally)", "Edmund Cobb (Henchman Zach Saddler)", "Bud Osborne (Henchman Lucky Howard)", "George DeNormand (Henchman Red (as George De Normand))", "Bill Hunter (Henchman Jess)", "Artie Ortego (Henchman Roy)", "Charles King (Henchman Steve Cook)", "Milburn Morante (Wilson (Hotel Owner) (as Milburn Moranti))", "Bill Nestell (Bartender Bill)", "Jack Daley (Pat McNally)", "Horace B.
