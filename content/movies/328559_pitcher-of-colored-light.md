The seasons move from the garden into the house, projecting rich diagonals in the early morning or late afternoon. Each shadow is a subtle balance of stillness and movement; it shows the vital instability of space. Its special quality opens a passage to the subjective; a voice within the film speaks to memory. The walls are screens through which I pass to the inhabited privacy. We experience a place through the perspective of where we come from and hear another's voice through our own acoustic. The sense of place is never separate from the moment.\" \u2013 R.B.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qLoMopaWqGCEonoPhuDp9aRDnkl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
