But that all changed in 1965 when a Minnesota Outward Bound class was opened to young women. At a time when girls should have been honing their housekeeping skills, 24 courageous young women took the challenge of a month of outdoor survival. This moment changed them and the Outward Bound program forever. Through interviews, footage of the Boundary Waters both then and now, and a heartwarming reunion, this documentary tells the story of these pioneering women.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a7qQuGcL6bI0woQI71nIZD6TRr0.jpg", "actors": ["Hannah Blase ()", "Devvie Booth Cersine ()", "May Coors ()", "Lynn Cox ()", "Cathy Crowson ()", "Maxine Davis ()", "Janice Comb Fraser ()", "Patti Giebink ()", "Marge Nelson Kellor ()", "Elizabeth Kilanowski ()", "Eileen O'Shaughnessy ()", "Jean Sanford Replinger ()", "Joan Thames ()", "Genie Mitchell Waters ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
