In a lovely Anatolian town, he earns a living as an attendant in a Turkish bath inherited from his great grandfathers. One day, a wealthy constructor named Tuncay wants to demolish the bath and the marketplace it is located in, and build a mall in their place. Barber Cemil, Kahraman's enemy, convinces the craftsmen in the marketplace and collaborates with Tuncay to start the demolishment immediately.
