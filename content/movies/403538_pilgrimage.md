They come from California by Greyhound bus, from Vancouver by plane, and on foot from many parishes surrounding Montr\u00e9al. What is the fame of this shrine, that it attracts the devout and the curious alike? The story is told by Brother Placide Vermand\u00e8re of the Order of the Holy Cross, who was personally acquainted with Brother Andr\u00e9, after whom the shrine's famous temple is named. Cameras follow a procession of the League of the Sacred Heart through the streets of the city to the famous sanctuary and show many of the religious observances conducted in the church, including Mass attended by invalids who come in the hope of being healed of various afflictions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qx9oIOS2jDhzMEH0LHgre6n63uL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
