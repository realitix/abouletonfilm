Especially in the opening theater sequence, and in the climactic \u201ctransformation\u201d sequence, several different shots are edited together to create a fluid, dynamic scene. Cinematography shows the first spark of flexibility with a couple of tilting movements. There is a new energy in direction with strong fore-to-back staging. There are also some insert close-ups and some relatively unusual medium close-ups of action.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["George Ober (Miser)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
