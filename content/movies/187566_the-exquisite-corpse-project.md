They agree with one stipulation: If they write the movie, he has to make it.  It's a comedy, a love story, a psycho-sexual thriller, and a supernatural adventure all in one. Meanwhile, documentary footage of the writing process provides an inside look into the often-hilarious creative process, as well as the group dynamics that make collaboration between friends difficult.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rlX82ZoWTyFqQUK4xRvSHSdU0Xo.jpg", "actors": ["Caleb Bark (Marc)", "Megan Raye Manzi (Adayit / Meg)", "Julia Frey (Stephanie)", "Trevor Williams (Yustus)", "Geoff Lee (Mr. Kim)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "LJBUQKvGZ0o"}
