Cummings poem.  Among the many accolades received, DownBeat magazine gave the album a coveted \"5 Stars\" review calling it \"sonically, one of the best recordings ever made by a jazz singer with a small acoustic ensemble.\" The response, and subsequent worldwide touring, led to Barber\u2019s signing to Blue Note Records one year later and the New York Times proclaiming: \u201cBarber\u2019s art is the kind of art we need to pay attention to.\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vufC9eeMif7VpFNqE96wgP3NtXJ.jpg", "actors": ["Patricia Barber (Patricia Barber)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
