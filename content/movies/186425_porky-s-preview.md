A skunk tries to buy a ticket, costing a nickel, but he only has one scent. He looks for a way to sneak in. Meanwhile, Porky introduces the show: a collection of cartoons, drawn as stick figures. At the end, the audience is all gone because the skunk managed to sneak in. Porky's cartoons include: Circus Parade, Choo-Choo Train, Soldiers (Marchin), Horse Race, and Dances (hula, Mexican hat, and ballet). All accompanied by a self-parody musical score.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5S46F9oHVI1vneNEkjA7xaCt3qB.jpg", "actors": ["Sara Berner (various)", "Mel Blanc (Porky Pig)", "Cliff Nazarro (various)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [87206, 188755, 185399], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
