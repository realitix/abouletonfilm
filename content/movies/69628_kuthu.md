Whether Silambarasan succeeds in marrying Divya Spandana, with the help of his college mates, forms the rest of the story. Srikanth Deva's tunes (he is in fact music director Deva's son) are catchy though familiar. The re-recording especially in stunt sequences is jarring.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8vzR5HRkPpV41PAMdjcYye1QDfu.jpg", "actors": ["Silambarasan (Guru)", "Ramya (Anjali)", "Livingston (College principal)", "Kalabhavan Mani (Anjali's father)", "Karunas (Guru's friend)", "Vijayakumar (Guru's Father)", "Kota Srinivasa Rao (Anjali's Grandfather)", "Manorama (Anjali's Grandmother)", "Aishwarya (Anjali's Mother)", "Ramya Krishnan (Cameo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
