He then wages war against his peaceful neighbors, killing their women and enslaving their men. A hero named Ursus appears at a tournament to challenge Hamilan's authority. Though victorious at the tournament, Ursus is arrested and forced to turn a grist-mill under an overseer's lash. Meanwhile, the former king's virtuous daughter, Diana, is tormented by her evil cousin, the new queen. Sentenced to a slow and tortuous execution, Ursus breaks free and a revolt breaks out. Ursus throws Hamilan to his death in a fiery pit and then Ursus and Diana enjoy the cheers of a grateful populace.  - Written by dinky-4 of Minneapolis", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zc4g29FjPyw2Y8xSZdntQ6PQowj.jpg", "actors": ["Ed Fury (Ursus)", "Luciana Gilli (Diana)", "Adriano Micantoni (Hamilcar)", "Claudia Mori (Mila)", "Nando Tamberlani (Lothar)", "Giuseppe Addobbati (Dorf\u00e4ltester)", "Pietro Ceccarelli (Lero)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
