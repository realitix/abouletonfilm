The film consists of loosely composed sequences. The landscape is the setting for a series of peculiar occurrences in which individual members were free to realize personal ideas, fantasies and themes: a man runs across the heath, shouting, a Molotov cocktail flares on a beach, a man repeatedly falls over, an angel-like woman makes a solitary procession, a burning pine, a man breaking a tree with a shovel, etc.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/26ueBlQPEUTdY9EO5ra7wNUGlOX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
