Every effort to calm Rupert is undone by an immediate commotion to wake him up. Joe rocks him to sleep, but then the neighbor starts playing his bass fiddle. Joe then rocks the cradle so hard it falls apart, and he trips and stumbles moving Rupert to the baby carriage, which subsequently rolls down hill through traffic with Rupert and a neighbor's monkey enjoying the ride.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6kvdIlbWJBzxfpe0MFrDupCKjNQ.jpg", "actors": ["Joe Cobb (Joe)", "Jean Darling (Jean)", "Allen 'Farina' Hoskins (Farina)", "Bobby 'Wheezer' Hutchins (Wheezer)", "Mary Ann Jackson (Mary Ann)", "Harry Spear (Harry)", "Pete the Dog (Pete)", "Warren Mills (Rupert)", "George Dunning (Our Gang member)", "Gordon Thorpe (Our Gang member)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
