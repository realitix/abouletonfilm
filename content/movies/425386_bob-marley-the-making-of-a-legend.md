The film shows us the Wailers' first rehearsal, when the idea of a Jamaican supergroup was still just a dream. Sit in as the albums of Bob Marley and the Wailers brought reggae music and Rasta consciousness to the world, starting a revolution that would change rock music and contemporary culture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6oJGWz1LhwKjB88rWdkDRQiBP0G.jpg", "actors": ["Bob Marley (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
