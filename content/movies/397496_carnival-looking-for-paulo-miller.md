Paulo \"Miller\" is known for taking a dangerous jump into the Alva from a bridge each year during carnival, but what this film is about is, in keeping with the free-roving feature, much less the subject himself than Gomes and co.'s inability to pin him down; not only does he not do his famous jump during this year's carnival, but an ostensible technical/audio failure (as with the feature, it's very difficult to say how much of this film is \"fact,\" how much invented) during Gomes's initial on-camera meeting with Paulo \"Miller\" leads to five minutes of lip-readers attempting to decipher their conversation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4YWpW2xsZLwTVAfL4DtnfKY0nzc.jpg", "actors": ["Raquel Bernardo ()", "Ana Cristina Ferreira ()", "Miguel Gomes ()", "Paulo Moleiro ()", "Vasco Pimentel ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
