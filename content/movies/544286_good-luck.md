Everything she does - whether it's work or play - is charmed and goes smoothly. After securing a meaty contract with Tarun Chopra, she is promoted by her boss, Kanchan Soni, and they celebrate with a masked party. It is here she meets with a male, Vicky Varma, dances with him and kisses him - thereby losing her luck. Shortly thereafter she not only gets arrested; gets lodged in a cell and slapped by a larger woman; but also gets fired. She moves in with a co-worker, Ritu, and both plan to locate the masked male, have Saba kiss him, and restore her good luck. But the question remains: how she is going to locate him?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uAVki5yKsHPXFbDqMNQEf4J8JQ9.jpg", "actors": ["Aryeman Ramsay (Vicky Varma (as Aryeman))", "Sayali Bhagat (Saba Sharma)", "Sharat Saxena (Inspector M.R.
