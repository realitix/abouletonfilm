Yusuke Mito, a law faculty lecturer who did not become a lawyer even though he passed the bar exam, the famous lawyer Kojiro Otomo who advocates the abolition of the death penalty, and the public prosecutor Mariko Nagase studied law together. Each have their own thoughts about the death penalty. One day, Otomo\u2019s wife is murdered by someone. Shinzo Sabae who is resentful of a lawsuit that Otomo had been in charge of, is arrested as a suspect. Otomo reverses the stance he had had until now and seeks the death penalty against Sabae. This prompts Mito to make the decision to become a lawyer and stand in the court. However, the first case Mito takes charge of is the defence of Sabae, who murdered the wife of his good friend, Otomo\u2026", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3CuFw63RgnrfKXLz8DP8NTVWXgf.jpg", "actors": ["Koji Yamamoto (Yusuke Mito)", "Yukiyoshi Ozawa (Kojiro Otomo)", "Naho Toda (Mariko Nagase)", "Kotomi Ky\u00f4no (Noriko Iijima)", "Yoshimasa Kond\u00f4 (Wataru Togane)", "Kenichi Yajima (Goro Takaishi)", "Yuriko Hirooka (Toshiko Togane)", "Jiro Sato (Takeshi Hoshino)", "Kei Yamamoto (Kosuke Mito)", "Akio Kaneda (Ryusuke Ishimaru)", "Takashi Kashiwabara (Shinzo Sabae)", "Ken Mitsuishi (Kazuho Karita)", "Akira Emoto (Kyusaku Tsushima)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
