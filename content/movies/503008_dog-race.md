Nakayama (Goro Kishitani) is a suave police detective who doesn't play by the rules. He busts a drug ring, but not before sampling a few of the wares, and he closes down an underaged prostitution ring after enjoying the company of a school girl hooker. One of duties is to shake down sniveling Korean gangster Hideyoshi (Ren Osugi) for information. In spite of their positions on opposite sides of the law, the two discover that they share a fair amount in common. A disregard for the law and the love of a comely prostitute from China named Momo-chan (Makoto Togashi). Though Hideyoshi is running an illegal alien smuggling ring with her and has lusted for her from a far for quite a while, Nakayama manages to bed her first. When she does finally appear in Hideyoshi's bed, she's unfortunately a corpse.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5C3FjXEgqqG1jF9zMf71HwfXJh6.jpg", "actors": ["Gor\u00f4 Kishitani (Nakayama)", "Ren Osugi (Hideyoshi (as Ren \u00d4sugi))", "Teruyuki Kagawa (Sakuma)", "Ken'ichi End\u00f4 (Gonda)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
