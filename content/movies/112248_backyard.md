He filled his little shack with equipment and prayed for good weather. Then he invited all of his neighbours, made them pizza, cupcakes and pancakes and treated them with some of the most exciting Icelandic musicians of their generation. While he was at it, another guy called \u00c1rni filmed the whole thing and the result is this beautiful documentary that provides a unique look at the culture and diverse music scene of modern day Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/32GlVVTvwDN3D06CSzhM9eUP0tc.jpg", "actors": ["Hjaltal\u00edn (Themselves)", "m\u00fam (Themselves)", "FM Belfast (Themselves)", "Retro Stefson (Themselves)", "Borko (Himself)", "Reykjav\u00edk!
