Catlin Adams plays a stunt rider at a carnival who has the hots for Navin (Martin) while Bernadette Peters plays a more important woman in his life.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Jerk\u201d (1979) has several laugh-out-loud scenes like the eventual confrontation between Patty (Catlin) and Marie (Peters), but there are also some flat, overlong parts, like when Navin departs the mansion in the last act. \u201cForrest Gump\u201d (1994) was obviously inspired by \u201cThe Jerk\u201d and made a more serious, popular picture. Jim Carrey also took a lot of inspiration from Martin and \u201cThe Jerk\u201d to forge the even funnier \u201cAce Ventura: Pet Detective\u201d (1994).   \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 34 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"}], "recommandations_id": [2609, 8388, 11977, 10890]}
