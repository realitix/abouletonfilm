The frontline of the global war is coming closer everyday; people are hungry, wor-ried, angry. In February the tsar is overthrown. Many artists are euphoric: Revolution! Freedom, finally? No. Starting in October, the Bolsheviks rule by themselves. What were poets, thinkers, and avant-gardists like Maxim Gorky and Kazimir Malevich doing during this drastic change of power? In the film, five of them alight from the director\u2019s piles of books as animated cut-out figures. With their own recorded words in their mouths, they participate in salons, committees, and street riots.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/anRIPdlCU1ubLVr0QXONT8r2F34.jpg", "actors": ["Maximilian Bauer (Wladimir Majakowski (voice))", "Hanns Zischler (Alexander Benois (voice))", "Martin Schneider (Maxim Gorki (voice))", "Inka Friedrich (Dokumentarfilmerin (voice))", "Claudia Michelsen (Sinaida Hippius (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
