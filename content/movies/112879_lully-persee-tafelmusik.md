Pers\u00e9e (1682) is one of Lully's greatest works for the stage. The opera concerns Perseus son of Jupiter, his love for Andromeda, and his killing of the snake-headed gorgon Medusa. The music is enchanting, with lots of celebratory choruses and orchestral divertissements.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mdTHusbD6QRiORe4OZdgVGr5RJL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
