Rosselini's 'Chastity' deals with an attractive air hostess who receives the unwelcome attentions of a middle aged American. Godard's 'New World' illustrates a post-apocalypse world the same as the pre-apocalyptic one but for an enigmatic change in attitude in most people, including the central character's girlfriend. In Pasolini's 'Curd Cheese', a lavish film about the life of Jesus Christ is being made in a poor area. The impoverished people subject themselves to various indignities in the name of moviemaking in order to win a little food. The central character is hoisted up on a cross for filming, and dies there. Finally comes Gregoretti's 'Free Range Chicken' in which a family of the materialist culture inadvertantly illustrate the cynical, metallic voiced doctrine of a top sales theorist.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lUIdW88hFIARvFQMLQSU1jo2W6o.jpg", "actors": ["Rosanna Schiaffino (Anna Maria (segment \"Illibatezza\"))", "Orson Welles (The 'Director' (segment \"La ricotta\"))", "Ugo Tognazzi (Togni (segment \"Il pollo ruspante\"))", "Ricky Tognazzi (The son (segment \"Il pollo ruspante\"))", "Tom\u00e1s Mili\u00e1n (Centurione (segment \"La ricotta\"))", "Bruce Balaban (Joe (segment \"Illibatezza\"))", "Maria Pia Schiaffino (Air hostess (segment \"Illibatezza\"))", "Jean-Marc Bory (Husband (segment \"Il nuovo mondo\"))", "Alexandra Stewart (Alexandra (segment \"Il nuovo mondo\"))", "Mario Cipriani (Stracci / Good Thief (segment \"La ricotta\"))", "Laura Betti (The 'Diva' (segment \"La ricotta\"))", "Edmonda Aldini (Another diva (segment \"La ricotta\"))", "Ettore Garofolo (Angel (segment \"La ricotta\"))", "Lisa Gastoni (Togni's wife (segment \"Il pollo ruspante\"))", "Antonella Taito (The daughter (segment \"Il pollo ruspante\"))", "Elsa De Giorgi (Productor's Wife (segment \"La ricotta\"))", "Rossana Di Rocco (Stracci's Daughter (segment \"La ricotta\"))", "Vittorio La Paglia (The Journalist (segment \"La ricotta\"))", "Franca Pasut (Visitor (segment \"La ricotta\"))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [47239, 239441, 222560, 49152], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
