This novel by the pro-regime writer also inspired a children\u2019s film, which was directed in 1981 by the experienced family filmmaker V\u00e1clav Gajer. The story takes place in 1947 and it is based on the popular model of the relationship between a human hero and an indomitable animal protagonist. The tale of the freedom necessary for life, is, of course, beholden to the standards of the time: the Hucul horse that heals an old villager, has remained in the small village in \u0160umava after the Soviet soldiers have left. This is a pleasing movie that engages with the acting performance of Zden\u011bk \u0158eho\u0159 and the depiction of the indisputable beauty of the \u0160umava landscape as shot by cameraman Jan N\u011bme\u010dek.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eYhplbKT574ayfNJT73SiX6g29U.jpg", "actors": ["Zden\u011bk \u0158eho\u0159 (Anton\u00edn Jakub)", "Milo\u0161 Nedbal (Bratranec)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
