The chosen setting \u2013 a night club in the centre of Berlin \u2013 creates the intimate, dark salon atmosphere in which the songs might also have been performed at the time they were written. Returning to origins in this way, the film departs from the concert atmosphere in which song-recitals are normally performed nowadays.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yg6smDiYSX1229o1Q9TSJBgPhNW.jpg", "actors": ["Christine Sch\u00e4fer ()", "Robert Hunger-B\u00fchler ()", "Natascha Osterkorn ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
