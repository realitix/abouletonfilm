Dissolution 2 is the continuation of investigations into the fragmentation of time and images through video. It also represents an attempt to reveal the material nature of this vehicle of illusions. Depictions of a film strip (with sprocket holes, frame lines, splices, etc.) were reduced to horizontal and vertical lines with a resolution comparable to that of video. The image itself comprises two different temporal structures which are interlaced in the alternation between the half images.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
