Handling a gun and sword as skillfully as a man, Fuji Junko portrays an appealing personality that differs from Oryu in the Red Peony Gambler series.  Tsuruta Koji stars as the vagabond Tsukuba Tsuneji that tops the list of an impressive all-star cast that includes Endo Tatsuo, Kogure Michiyo, Ashiya Gannosuke, Kitamura Eizo, and many others. This film is an authentic yakuza movie that conveys the true \"Matatabi\" (wandering gambler) feeling.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/savnhX02DyvUWvW2DTqogvPtJGb.jpg", "actors": ["Sumiko Fuji (Tsumagoi Okoma)", "Koji Tsuruta (Joji Tsukuba)", "Gannosuke Ashiya (Katsuji Hanada)", "Michiyo Kogure (Otaki)", "Tatsuo End\u00f4 ()", "Eiz\u00f4 Kitamura (Zenzo)", "Shizue Natsukawa (Otami)", "Minoru Shiraki ()", "Takuz\u00f4 Kawatani ()", "Akira Shioji ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
