The main topic of this film is arguably one of the most important issues of our time: social and economic immobility. Inequality has been on the rise in America for more than three decades. Middle and low income wages have remained stagnant or decreased while top earners have seen their wages increase 135% since 1979. Today, the top .1% of Americans owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%. This film is incredibly timely because of the staggering state of inequality today, but this film is also important because it is new. By bringing the unique perspective of gender to this story, this film expands the conversation around the causes and solutions to America's inequality and division.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pDDXk1oDMjJOfPulikDtQBKJwZD.jpg", "actors": ["Nicholas Kristof (Himself)", "Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond (Herself)", "Libby Schaaf (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
