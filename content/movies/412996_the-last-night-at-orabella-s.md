Les and Dolly Colsey re-live the night they met, Blind Man Jackson returns to play a final set with Country Wayne Conaway and the Swingin' Sidekicks, Bridgette Fertle tries to determine Angina's real father, and romance blooms when Taint Bueller is courted by a parade of Dumpsterians while Gwenda relentlessly hits on a depressed Uncle Al.
