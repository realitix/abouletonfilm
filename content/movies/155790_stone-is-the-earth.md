Young Vergel left his family to take as job as a miner, and following a long stretch away from home he returns and enjoys a reunion with his younger siblings, a mischievous brother and a sister who is newly aware of matters of the heart. All is well in the household until Vergel makes a startling discovery -- there are gold deposits on the family's farm. Vergel's first concern is the safety and well-being of his family, but as the value of the gold claim rises, his lust for money begins to overpower his common sense and regard for others.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7opjhsGrWxYHqMYv5YGIwbIkM6V.jpg", "actors": ["Edwin Pamanian (Vergel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
