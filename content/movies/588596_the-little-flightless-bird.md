He dreamed of rising into the air. After one of the unsuccessful attempts, he dropped into the water and caught a gold fish that turned him into a balloon for his wishes. Fascinated by the plane, he asked the fish to become a great machine. He flew around the world. He introduced confusion on air routes and disrupted the work of radars. Tired he returned to the island and fell like a dead man. After waking up, he happily joined the other penguins.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
