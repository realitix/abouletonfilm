To teach him a lesson, she shows up at his estancia pretending to be a maid. Working from a popular stage play adapted by tango lyricist and versatile writer Homero Manzi, Luis Saslavsky directed a screwball comedy with singing star Libertad Lamarque. Giving the film\u2019s title an ironic twist, Lamarque is cast as Sol Bernal, a platinum blonde defying class conventions in 1940s Argentina. A comedy of white telephones and lovely musical numbers, Eclipse de sol is peppered with sentimental touches and a dash of sex farce, thanks to Saslavsky\u2019s visual sophistication.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7KqiANeRYTaTWMoc6cM0tttjSb3.jpg", "actors": ["Libertad Lamarque (Sol Bernard)", "George Rigaud ()", "Pedro Quartucci ()", "Angelina Pagano ()", "Alita Rom\u00e1n ()", "Juana Sujo ()", "Alberto Terrones ()", "Raimundo Pastore ()", "Celia Geraldy ()", "Benita Pu\u00e9rtolas ()", "Iris Martorell ()", "In\u00e9s Murray ()", "Adriana Alcock ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
