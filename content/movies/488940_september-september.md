Rainy rides along Sch\u00f6nhauser Allee, which seems to be depopulated. Past the 'Viennese Caf\u00e9', the meeting place par excellence. From a moving train the view of idyllic landscapes, on the horizon a castle. The camera tilts, turns, until the world is upside down. Scenes of an action with the artist friend Heike Stephan: in the sanctuary Hahnemann, black painted with a white turban, and Stephan, stack cages with rabbits on top of each other. Then TV recordings of a discussion forum with Jean-Luc Godard and Rosa von Praunheim - scenes as from another planet. From the off again and again a poem Hahnemann, recited by Peter Mario Graus. The diction is initially calm, almost factual, increases, eventually overturns, but then falls back, resigned. \" (Claus L\u00f6ser in \"Gegenbilder\")", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7tJCWXNcpEmCkpos4vBr9N8EJms.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
