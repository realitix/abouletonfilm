Feng is greatly moved by Bingai\u2019s uncompromising personality. Feng says that most Chinese people give up their land too easily, like losers. Meanwhile, the extraordinary effort Feng puts into making this documentary is comparable to Bingai\u2019s perseverance. In this sense, the filmmaker and her subject are mirror image of each other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lrY7uGKST7UxL3axddTFtnsWoSz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
