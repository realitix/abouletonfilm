After stumbling upon the shrine of Lucy, a hit and run victim, Tess finds herself overwhelmed by hallucinations of the dead girl and starts to question her sanity again.  When the spirit possesses Tess\u2019s mind and soul, mother and daughter are at a loss for where to turn next for salvation: religion or medicine?  Both institutions have failed them to date but faith leads them to the house of Sarah, Lucy\u2019s mother, who has been despondent since the accident.  All together with time working against them, Sarah is desperate to believe that Lucy is still alive in Tess but neither parent wants to give up on their daughter.  Now that she understands what is happening to her, ultimately Tess must decide whether she wants to keep fighting or succumb to her affliction.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mjzcibK6JGwJaL3oldm9HsiSNaj.jpg", "actors": ["Ryan Simpkins (Tess)", "Annika Marks (Jessica)", "Karina Logue (Sarah)", "Amberley Gridley (Lucy)", "Cliff Chamberlain (Robert)", "Ryan O'Nan (Father Meyers)", "Paulina Olszynski (Morgan)", "Christian Litke (Priest)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [328763, 354220, 410270, 322163], "youtube_key": "2GVMsY4CwD0"}
