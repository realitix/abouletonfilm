Spinsterish Ann-Margret, who has long harbored a fondness for Bates, hopes to take advantage of his memory loss. But both Christie and Ann-Margret are challenged by a third woman, Bates' childhood sweetheart Glenda Jackson. Poor Bates deals with all of this by not dealing with it. A fairly faithful rendition of the Rebecca West novel on which it is based, Return of the Soldier ambles along at its own languid pace to a inconclusive conclusion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8aEWrbSa31CpuHGYyIlMVp1lNER.jpg", "actors": ["Alan Bates (Chris Baldry)", "Glenda Jackson (Margaret Grey)", "Ann-Margret (Jenny Baldry)", "Julie Christie (Kitty Baldry)", "Ian Holm (Doctor Anderson)", "Frank Finlay (William Grey)", "Jeremy Kemp (Frank)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ADrrF9zyuZ0"}
