A truly exquisite performance, where the band played many fan favorites including two Talisman songs, as well as one song each from Eclipse and Work of Art. The Eclipse song was Bleed &amp; Scream which was sung by Erik Martensson and the Work Of Art song was The Great Fall where the band were joined by Lars S\u00e4fsund, lead singer W.O.A. The show was filmed and recorded for a live CD / DVD release, which also includes two unreleased bonus tracks, studio cuts taken from the Rise Up sessions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4TZqTIbMjbDoE1Gc7kG69qxPCsT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
