Pilger asks why the qualities seen in the paper prior to the 1970s are no longer apparent, examining the contraction of the press following the Sun's symbolic move to Wapping, coverage of the Hillsborough disaster, the fate of the Daily Mirror under Robert Maxwell, and the stranglehold of Rupert Murdoch.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/39XyOpwmxV6T0EhaC1d8vNWuw2y.jpg", "actors": ["John Pilger (Himself - Presenter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
