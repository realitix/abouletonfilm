The legend claims whomever consumes its flesh will attain remarkable longevity. He presents the project to his peers, who mock and dismiss him as a fraud. He decides to risk everything and go after the Ningyo on his own in hopes to bring to light what could be one of the greatest contributions to science. What he could not anticipate is that, in his search, he is confronted with a choice that puts the very foundations of his morality to the test.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sGAoM9QQr5g23nGZraZ0XjVlLbk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
