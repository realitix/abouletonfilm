With an amazing director and original music score, it is my delight to offer you CRUX!!!  Bonus Content includes my video segments from:  The Collective  Roam  Kranked 6  Leaps &amp; Bounds  Freeride Fundamentals  ES2 Fully Loaded  CRUX defined: a particular point of difficulty.  This singular word precisely describes the riding formula of the film. Each and every line that the featured athletes, Ryan Leech, Dylan Korba, and Thomas Ohler ride has a CRUX. These three riders, aggressively pursuing Leech's Manifesto Style, execute mind-bending feats of bike mastery.
