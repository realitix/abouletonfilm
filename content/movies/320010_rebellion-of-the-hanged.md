The actor is cast as a peasant who works in a mahogany camp in the Mexican jungles with his family. Disgusted with the miserable living conditions imposed upon himself and his co-workers, the peasant finally spearheads a revolt against the sadistic bosses. Some of the scenes of brutality and torture are almost impossible to watch, and as such were trimmed when the film was released to the U.S. by United Artists. The film was based on a novel by Berwick Traven, of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre fame.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5GJVcnBe3m5jLH17BID5qT23e7A.jpg", "actors": ["Pedro Armend\u00e1riz (C\u00e1ndido Castro)", "Ariadna Welter (Modesta)", "V\u00edctor Junco (Celso)", "Carlos L\u00f3pez Moctezuma (Don F\u00e9lix)", "Amanda del Llano (Aurea)", "Jaime Fern\u00e1ndez (Urbano)", "Luis Aceves Casta\u00f1eda (Don Acacio)", "Miguel \u00c1ngel Ferriz (Don Severo)", "\u00c1lvaro Matute (El picaro)", "Tito Junco (Don Gabriel)", "Agust\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez (Gusano)", "Carlos Riquelme (Don Ra\u00fal)", "Ramiro Orci (Pascacio)", "Rogelio Fern\u00e1ndez (Mart\u00edn Trinidad)", "Guillermo \u00c1lvarez Bianchi (Gordo)", "Eduardo Alcaraz (Doctor)", "Francisco Reiguera (Director funerario)", "Margarito Luna (Felipe)", "Ismael P\u00e9rez (Angelito)", "Roberto Contreras ((uncredited))", "Bruno M\u00e1rquez ((uncredited))", "Salvador Terroba ((uncredited))", "Emilio Garibay (Capataz (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [30323, 30322, 41307], "youtube_key": "yfA_OBqLGeM"}
