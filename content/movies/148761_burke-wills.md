The two are thrown together in a share house after Wills outstays his welcome in the home of his girlfriend, and a newspaper classified ad leads him to Burke, who has a room to rent. The beginnings of an awkward relationship develop through beer-assisted conversations about cooking, travel, and the importance of satisfactory toilet visits.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m6v3CbX9KySc4XyilwilEJwNWl.jpg", "actors": ["Oliver Torr (Burke)", "Matt Zeremes (Wills (as Matthew Zeremes))", "Daniel Feuerriegel (Guy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
