She invented the multiplane camera and created the first feature length animation. Lotte that Silhouette Girl is an homage to her, told in Lotte\u2019s style, with stop motion shadow animation and through a lens of folktale storytelling. For many unjust reasons, Lotte is just a footnote in the history of film, but she revolutionized animation and made it what it is today. In this short film, Lotte\u2019s puppets have come back to life to set the story straight.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6HTt9Uh6E519ktCW1S9ZOmPcW6a.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
