Tanya has been supporting her husband, a former ballplayer, since his accident, waiting for an insurance settlement that will solve all their financial woes. But when it comes, he refuses to share it with her, claiming with newfound piety that money is the root of all evil. She then enlists the help of Benny to concoct a scheme to get her fair share of the settlement, and he finds one: a local Catholic mission needs money for repairs and Benny decides to create a miracle that will encourage husband Henry to fork over the money - which Benny and Tanya will intercept and share.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iodaTExr7qKBqmQD7ydIP1kK3Ey.jpg", "actors": ["Lara Flynn Boyle (Tanya Mulhill)", "Danny Nucci (Jesse Torrejo)", "Peter Dobson (Benny O'Malley)", "Luca Bercovici (Henry Mulhill)", "Michael Chieffo (Inspector)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Qpxux0GPeaY"}
