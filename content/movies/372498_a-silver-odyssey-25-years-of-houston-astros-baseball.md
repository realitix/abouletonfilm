Enjoy many of the great moments in Houston's baseball history including Ken Johnson's no-hitter, which he lost, Don Wilson's spectacular performances on the mound, and Nolan Ryan's triumph in overtaking Walter Johnson's strikeout record, just to name a few.  Relive the story of the Astros as told by the stars who experienced it: like Rusty Staub, Joe Morgan and Mike Scott. From an expansion team in 1962 to today's National League Western Division Champions, \"A Silver Odyssey\" captures a quarter-century of history, humor and excitement.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9MPIadD7012gyXM3aDr0zcFaQwX.jpg", "actors": ["J.D.
