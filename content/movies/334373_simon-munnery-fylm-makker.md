In these shows, Simon never appears on stage. Instead he sits in the audience behind a box of tricks that can display his face, the table or both. From here he contrives to make live films - or Fylms - which are projected on a big screen at the front of the theatre. What you see on the DVD is exactly what the audiences saw on their big screen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zT0aHqs8P9AuIti4vcvRxRWmtIy.jpg", "actors": ["Simon Munnery (Fylm Makker)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
