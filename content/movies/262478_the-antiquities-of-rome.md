Again hard places played against drifting sounds from unseen sites beyond the image; the images and sounds, repeated, become inflections of each other. But this time there are historical inflections; Rousseau's film, like Straub's, takes place in a sort of meta-history as characters and ancient sites each become products of outside light and shadow.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v6q6CObEivdTL6nL1yFRNGy5Vfa.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
