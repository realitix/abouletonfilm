What was supposed to be an exhilarating and somewhat fearful rite of passage - diving into the exciting, fast-paced world of first experiences - quickly becomes skewed by an incomprehensible depression, and a house of interior horrors. Surrounded by women - his untraditional, Spanish, photographer mother (more interested in the role of confidante than mother) his sister, a comedic, door-slamming tormentor, marked by her parent's divorce; and Aida, his silver-haired emotional focal point on the verge of death in Lenox Hill Hospital - Oliver struggles to maintain his role as \"man of the house\" and his sanity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xcEeGwhJZ6cmjUwYqP19q5FHCy8.jpg", "actors": ["Spencer List (Oliver Nicholas)", "Pilar L\u00f3pez de Ayala (Luna Nicholas)", "Adriana Barraza (Aida)", "Eric Nelson (Valerio)", "Courtney Baxter (Adriana Nicholas)", "Tommy Nelson (Nick)", "Heather Braverman (Lila)", "Marlee Roberts (Annabel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [160210, 253315, 137376, 174378], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
