Faced with the threat of violence, loneliness, the lack of financial resources or information about services, the victim is often understandably reluctant to seek help. Emphasizing the importance for women of speaking out, the film also points out the role of the transition house in putting victims of abuse in touch with appropriate legal and social services.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Holly Dressel (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
