But her father's goodwill to take in Daniel and bring him up does not sit well with her real older brother, who retaliates one day and kicks Daniel out. But by this time, nothing can come between the deeply in love Andrea and Daniel anymore--until the rich family on whose hacienda they've been working all these years come back.
