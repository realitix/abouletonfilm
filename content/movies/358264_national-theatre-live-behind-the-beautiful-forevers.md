But beyond the luxury hotels surrounding Mumbai airport lies a makeshift slum, full of people with plans of their own. Zehrunisa and her son Abdul aim to recycle enough rubbish to fund a proper house. Sunil, twelve and stunted, wants to eat until he\u2019s as tall as Kalu the thief. Asha seeks to steal government anti-poverty funds to turn herself into a \u2018first-class person\u2019, while her daughter Manju intends to become the slum\u2019s first female graduate.  But their schemes are fragile; global recession threatens the garbage trade, and another slum-dweller is about to make an accusation that will destroy herself and shatter the neighbourhood.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6poAsrCld6JARDWOSpRlZLDmrEl.jpg", "actors": ["Meera Syal ()", "Vincent Ebrahim ()", "Sartaj Garewal ()", "Muzz Khan ()", "Ranjit Krishnamma ()", "Stephanie Street ()", "Hiran Abeysekera ()", "Esh Alladi ()", "Nathalie Armin ()", "Pal Aron ()", "Tia-Lana Chinapyel ()", "Mariam Haque ()", "Thusitha Jayasundera ()", "Manjeet Mann ()", "Nikita Mehta ()", "Anjli Mohindra ()", "Tia Palamathanan ()", "Ronak Patani ()", "Bharti Patel ()", "Pehrr Ramrakhyani ()", "Anneika Rose ()", "Chook Sibtain ()", "Gavi Singh Chera ()", "Anjana Vasan ()", "Assad Zaman ()", "Shane Zaza ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
