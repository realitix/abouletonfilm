Stone's Weekly", "slug_title": "i-f-stone-s-weekly", "date": "1973-10-18", "genre": [""], "score": "5.0/10", "synopsis": "A fascinating portrait of the maverick Washington journalist who, blacklisted during the McCarthy era, started his own paper (running it for some seventeen years) and became a master political gadfly. Stone himself is a delight: witty, irreverent, forever puncturing the lies he claims it is in the nature of all politicians to tell. Brilliantly edited throughout, the real triumph of the film is the way it intercuts Stone's comments with newsreel footage to demonstrate how much of a point he has.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2Uy5bXIB9qQ1b9gND1juaqXm0Ms.jpg", "actors": ["I.
