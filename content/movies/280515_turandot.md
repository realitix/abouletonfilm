Puccini draws heavily on the chorus, and as ever makes intense demands on his heroine, to which Eva Marton rises powerfully, very well complemented by the tenor Michael Sylvester as Calaf. However, what makes this 1994 San Francisco Opera version so enchanting as a visual experience is the realisation by David Hockney, who not only designed the sets and costumes but also directed the production. His vision is highly stylised, richly imagined, atmospheric and very beautiful, and it is a testament to how well this version is directed that much of the original magic is communicated through the confines of a TV screen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cJgxbUJTDJCuzYPidP6mQ5urHCp.jpg", "actors": ["Eva Marton (Turandot)", "Michael Sylvester (Calaf)", "Lucia Mazzaria (Liu)", "Kevin Langan (Timur)", "Theodore Baerg (Ping)", "Craig Estep (Pong)", "Joseph Frank (Emperor Altoum)", "Chester Patton (Mandarin)", "Tim Lewis (Prince of Persia)", "Victor Liu (Executioner)", "Dennis Petersen (Pang)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
