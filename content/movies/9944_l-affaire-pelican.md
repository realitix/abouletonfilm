Pakula from John Grisham\u2019s novel, \"The Pelican Brief\u201d is a political drama/thriller about a law student (Julia Roberts) who researches the murders of two supreme court justices and shares her theory with her college professor (Sam Shepard) who, in turn, gives it to an FBI friend on a lark. The brief hits a nerve because people start dying one-by-one. Denzel Washington plays a DC reporter who teams-up with the student while Robert Culp appears as the president. \r\n\r\nWhile I prefer \u201cThe Firm\u201d (1993), which was also written by Grisham, this one is along the same lines, albeit with a totally different story (naturally). \u201cPelican\u201d has more action, but the plot/characters aren\u2019t quite as interesting IMHO. Still, if you liked one, you\u2019ll probably appreciate the other.    \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 21 minutes and was shot in New Orleans and Washington DC/Maryland. ADDITIONAL CAST: John Heard plays an FBI agent, Stanley Tucci a hitman and John Lithgow an editor.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-"}], "recommandations_id": [37233, 8834, 10731, 9869], "youtube_key": "4k9bqqLUge0"}
