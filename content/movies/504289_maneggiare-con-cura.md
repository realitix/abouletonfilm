It looks like a futuristic sculpture, but we\r find that it is actually a scientific instrument.\r The film follows, step by step, the restoration of a 1950 particle accelerator at the Museo\r Nazionale della Scienza e della Tecnologia in Milan. We observe the restoration of the\r materials, surfaces, and valves, to the recovery of memories and gestures. It is a collective\r rite: restorers, curators, former users of the machine work to transform a \"thing\" taken\r from the everyday life of the laboratory into a museum \"object,\" the guardian of several\r stories.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
