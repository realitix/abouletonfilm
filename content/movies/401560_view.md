The View speaks of children's feelings, evident in many broken families. Since the story is told from a child's point of view, the memories which the child conveys are mostly exaggerated and could be misrepresented. Still, a child's point of view tells the most truthful stories.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rt4aGL793qfPIArrA6qRpBNPcA0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
