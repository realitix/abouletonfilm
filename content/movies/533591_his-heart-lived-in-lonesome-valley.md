Never allowing itself to be fully comprehendible, the film maneuvers through the unknown with a bizarre, darkly comedic vision. To begin, the man receives a message from an ominous visitor (himself?) suggesting he have a party. Agreeing, he goes upstairs to get ready, and that's where an immortal soul (embodied as a single pea on the floor) catches his attention and leads him on a voyage through time and space. The gloriously strange conceit is delivered with enigmatic visuals and atmospheres and leaves a haunting impression.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
