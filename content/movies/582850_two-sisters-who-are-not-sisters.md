Beatrice Gibson\u2019s adaptation, set almost a century later in contemporary Paris, deploys Stein\u2019s script as a talismanic guide through a contemporary moment of comparable social and political unrest. An original soundtrack, written especially for the film by British composer Laurence Crane, responds to the repetition, duplication and duality at play in Stein\u2019s script. Both a fictional thriller and an act of collective representation, Deux Soeurs proposes empathy and friendship as means to reckon with an increasingly turbulent present.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hat2LX8aDsajeV0Ta5i9ZeKDwud.jpg", "actors": ["Adam Christensen ()", "Basma Alsharif ()", "Ana Vaz ()", "Maria Palacios Cruz ()", "Alice Notley ()", "Diocouda Diaoune ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
