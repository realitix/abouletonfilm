Therefore we adore Cecilia Bartoli for the magnificent performance as the crazy Nina who lost her mind totally. Her magnificent singing, we don't doubt at all, but her acting is amazingly such that it expressed a real situation of a girl becoming crazy and losing her mind caused by painful incidents in her love life. It is also supported by the other singers who are singing matching as perfectly and splendidly as the diva Cecilia Bartoli, especially the baritone Laszlo Polgar with his deep rich voice as the cruel father who has remorse and came back to see his daughter Nina and the young tenor Jonas Kauffmann with his clear light voice, resulting in a surprisingly beautifully performed opera.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kmqBN3Q0PAJQSljhdlbKNWSdax2.jpg", "actors": ["Cecilia Bartoli (Nina)", "Jonas Kaufmann (Lindoro/Pastore)", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Polg\u00e1r (Il Conte)", "Juliette Galstian (Susanna)", "Angelo Veccia (Giorgio)", "Federica Bartoli (Villanella)", "Golda Fischer (Villanella)", "\u00c1d\u00e1m Fischer (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
