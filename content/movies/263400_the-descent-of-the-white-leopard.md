Apparently the Kirghizian folks had plenty of time to tell this story: to print a full synopsis would result in a novelette. Essentially, the story involves a proud group of highland hunters called the Snow Leopards, who in order to survive a brutal winter must request help from the Lowland people. The price for this assistance is the hand of the Snow Leopard's daughter, who is promised in marriage to a wealthy Lowland trader. During the Springtime wedding celebration, the trader becomes fascinated by a stranger who wins all the athletic contests. This \"male\" contestant turns out to be a woman, who has arrived to seek freedom for her imprisoned husband. The subsequent romance between the trader and the beautiful stranger results in disaster and bloodshed for both the Snow Leopards and the Lowlanders.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/375n8R7UQ1w2ggivIzfIjmEaLad.jpg", "actors": ["Dokhdurbek Kydyraliyev (Koshoshash)", "Aliman Zhankorozova (Saikal)", "Doskhan Zholzhaksynov (Mundusbai)", "Gulnara Alimbayeva (Aike)", "Ashir Chokubayev ()", "Marat Zhanteliev ()", "Dzhamal Seidakhmatova ()", "Gulnara Kydyraliyeva ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
