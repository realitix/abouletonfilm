On their lunch break they go into a restaurant with their Japanese uniforms on causing the proprietor to mistake them for the real thing, and a chase ensues. The boys fall through a trap door, and into a nest of Nazi spies where they are mistaken for \"Naki\", \"Saki\" and \"Waki\", three Japanese saboteurs. The stooges try to act the part, including demonstrating acrobatics and jiu-jitsu to their hosts. When the real \"Naki\", \"Saki\" and \"Waki\" show up, the boys are exposed and impostors, but after a wild fight manage to capture all the Axis spies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b5qCrj1D4K2so03xNLIJolZQq3f.jpg", "actors": ["Curly Howard (Curly)", "Vernon Dent (Hugo (Nazi spy))", "Christine McIntyre (Celia Zweiback)", "Moe Howard ()", "Larry Fine ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
