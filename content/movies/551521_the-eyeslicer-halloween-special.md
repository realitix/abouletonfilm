From an X-rated Halloween party hookup to a coming of age story set on the eve of Ted Bundy\u2019s execution; from a documentary about pumpkin carving and misogyny to a supercut about the gendered dangers of the bathtub; from a cursed stand-up comedy set to a woman ( Carrie Coon) trapped inside a Red Lobster commercial; from a John Carpenter homage (featuring a cameo by Carpenter himself) to a sequel to The Eyeslicer\u2019s now infamous Gwilliam, The Eyeslicer Halloween Special is an experience like no other \u2013 a deranged, proudly transgressive anthology carving out a bold new space in the Midnight movie genre.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/buDos61fdOOPh6vdY6JaTcDLQeE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
