Not only addressing viewers directly, Snow's narration attempts to direct our eyes toward specific portions of the image, as if spectatorial vision could function in a manner analogous to camera vision.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6eJAyokcrr6kFMLNQgxycEP6UQ8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
