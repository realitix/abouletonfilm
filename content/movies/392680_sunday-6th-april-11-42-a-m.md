It is a video that focuses on the relationships between actions and places, movements and the environment, because it points out that people are the place in which they live as well as the trajectories which the place itself creates. The video underlines the reciprocal connection between environment and its inhabitants, where territory plays an inevitable role also in its anthropomorphic transformations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bfusP7kWs1DD5seBkF1G6cNHrk5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
