This time, Leung puts on omega hair and woman's clothing, posing as a rich woman in order to help his two friends get love. Liu is equally amusing, sharing the dance floor with Leung in a hilarious dance scene. Loosely based on the British play Charley's Aunt, the film is a delightful comedy on grassroots, offering a refreshing alternative to MP & GI's usual line of comedies.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Christine Pai Lu-ming ()", "Chung Ching ()", "Kelly Lai Chen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
