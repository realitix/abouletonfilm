How many types of family structures are there? Age, Class, Gender and Survival continue to distort the facets of emotional relationships among humans. I like to think that Taiwanese are like desperate fishes in troubled waters, struggling to get to the water surface for a breath of fresh air.  In 2013, Taiwan bids goodbye to the toll booth system as it launches a new electrical device called eTag. With the new system, Chia-wen, a middle-aged divorcee working in a toll booth on the freeway, is about to be laid off. Her financial burden increases when her teenage son is charged with sexual assault. At this difficult time, Chia-wen meets Chih-hao, who promises to help in exchange for sex. Standing at a crossroads in her life, Chia-wen is uncertain which step to take next.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gcIFUrWKewfdr5iHuZxrALT7LhF.jpg", "actors": ["Ivy Yin (Jia Wen)", "Cheng Jen-Shuo ()", "\u9673\u9f0e\u4e2d ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
