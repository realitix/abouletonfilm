Annemarie Schwarzenbach, who was among Erika and Klaus Mann's circle of friends in the 30s, is searching for a place of refuge in the Near East to discover her own self. Ella Maillart justifies her restlessness, her need for movement and travel, with a scientific pretext: she would like to explore the mysterious Kafiristan Valley and make a name for herself with publications on the archaic life of the nomads living there. Both women are on the run, but political developments and their own biographies catch up with them again and again. Their mutual journey through the outside world, which runs from Geneva via the Balkans and Turkey to Persia, is compounded by the inner world of emotions with a tender love story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7P7DNXPVf3R6LCjHg9TGXR0xXNK.jpg", "actors": ["Jeanette Hain (Annemarie Schwarzenbach)", "Nina Petri (Ella Maillart)", "Thomas Morris (Deutscher 2)", "Wolfgang Rau (Bibliothekar)", "Christof Wackernagel (Engl\u00e4nder)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
