The episode intercuts footage from Eye of the Storm with new footage of the students, who are now adults. The film takes us through the journey of a young class learning the unfairness of racism. Elliot teaches the lesson through eye color and different treatment. All of the students admit that this is wrong. In footage of the students as adults, we are able to see how this shaped the experiment changed their lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kdsGTpTFmVJiG6cGvMCfsIlP9M4.jpg", "actors": ["Jane Elliott (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
