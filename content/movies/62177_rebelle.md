It was enjoyable sure, and had some good morals and family values but I never felt like I was invested in the main characters. Stuff just seemed to happen.\r\n\r\nSecondly, and this isn't as much the movies fault as perhaps the marketing that surrounded it, but it was actually a very different movie than I thought it was going to be. I discovered that it's hard to break those pre-conceptions as I kept thinking the story was going somewhere else than it did.\r\n\r\nBrave was at its best when it made me laugh which  unfortunately, was just too seldom. For example, the entire scene where the 3 clans try to fight for M\u00e9rida's hand was way too short!\r\n\r\nThe voice cast was very good though. Kelly Macdonald in particular, was perfect as M\u00e9rida.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Brave was good but not great. It just seems to lack the \"magic\" I expect from Pixar. Not their worst outing but close to it."}], "recommandations_id": [38757, 62211, 585, 82690]}
