His aggressive play shakes up both the league, and local folk rocker Sherrie Lee Nelson (Trudy Young) digs Duke off the ice but can't handle his violent profession.\r\n\r\nThe film was produced by John F. Bassett, who is a pioneer in Canadian feature filmmaking, among other pursuits.\r\n\r\nThis was a project close to VSC President Jonathan Gross' heart; aside from being a true hockey fan, he spent years trying to get the copyright holders to offer up even a limited release. Considering this to be buried treasure, Gross believes the 1971 release of Face Off  will inspire the same enchantment 40 years after its original release.\r\n\r\n\"All in all, the hockey action, shot in 35 mm, much of it during real games and integrated into the story line, is the real hidden treasure in Face Off,\" says Gross. \"For the fan of a certain vintage it will be like uncorking a fine wine that has aged very well.\"\r\n\r\nLeaf fans get about 20 minutes of action in Maple Leaf Gardens and on the road against legendary Original Six rivals of the 70s, including Detroit, Chicago and Boston in many bygone arenas. Dave Keon, Paul Henderson, Brian Glennie, Jim Dorey, Norm Ullman and a young Darryl Sittler are seen facing off against the likes of Bobby Orr, Gordie Howe and Jean Beliveau while Leaf captain George \"The Chief \"Armstrong has a significant speaking part in the film, along with NHL bad boy Derek Sanderson.\r\n\r\nVSC has restored the action-packed, cameo-filled classic from a 35mm print in the Toronto Film Reference Library archive and added commentary from Art Hindle, Trudy Young, and producer Harve Sherman."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ig9aeTrfZSQ"}
