The play concerns a group of seven-year-olds playing in the Forest of Dean one summer afternoon in 1943. It ends abruptly when the character Donald is burned to death as a result of the other children's actions. Perhaps the most striking feature of the play is that, although the characters are children, they are played by adult actors. Potter first used this device in Stand Up, Nigel Barton and returned to it in Cold Lazarus.  The dialogue is written in a Forest of Dean dialect, which Potter also uses extensively in other dramas incorporating a Forest of Dean setting, most notably A Beast with Two Backs, Pennies from Heaven and The Singing Detective.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/CczldpCYCLVGMyDJkN0GtiMPIg.jpg", "actors": ["Colin Welland (Willie)", "Michael Elphick (Peter)", "Robin Ellis (John)", "John Bird (Raymond)", "Helen Mirren (Angela)", "Janine Duvitski (Audrey)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
