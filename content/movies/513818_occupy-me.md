But when a flirtatious word-spar about sexual positions turns unwittingly into a debate over something else entirely, both men take sides against the other and replace that could-be beautiful connection with anger, resentment and accusation. OCCUPY ME is about the insidious way outside issues can seep into our interpersonal relationships and invade and cloud our perceptions until love is replaced by anger, truth is pushed out by fear, and potential is destroyed by the past.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3remWLoLSl4xDRGsH4BX1rOBT6Y.jpg", "actors": ["Jaspal Binning (Sam)", "Max Rhyser (David)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
