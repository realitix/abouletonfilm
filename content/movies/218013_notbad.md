A tale of seven brave riders who set out from the four corners of the globe to gather together under one roof in a town located at the ends of the earth. A tale with no beginning and no end but where a few things happen in between. Things like eel fights. Yeah that's right... eel fights. So watch this movie. Why? Because it's NotBad... 30 days of bicycle tomfoolery in New Zealand. A new film from the crew who brought you The Collective, Roam, Seasons, Follow Me and Strength in Numbers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2ImzIJBfa2mHbwTYgrjD05Gee1e.jpg", "actors": ["Brandon Semenuk ()", "Brook MacDonald ()", "Brett Rheeder ()", "Cam McCaul ()", "Andrew Shandro ()", "Rene Wildhaber ()", "Ryan Howard ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
