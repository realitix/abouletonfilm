Then the \"dead man\" will suddenly show up at his partner's murder trial. Unfortunately, things don't quite go as planned. For one thing, no one seems to much care that the \"dead man\" is missing, and for another thing he's mistaken for the leader of a Balkan revolutionary group and is kidnapped by the other side.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s9OtuXg14d0AGyBd0SbMtR0sG7e.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Buchanan (Teddy Enton)", "Maurice Chevalier (Fran\u00e7ois Verrier)", "June Knight (Grace Gatwick)", "Marta Labarr (Sonia)", "Gertrude Musgrove (Helena)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
