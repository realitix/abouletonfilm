The anthropological understanding of following subjects to record their lives is re-oriented. Rather than (critically) explaining the actions, believes or norms of certain subjects, the film concentrates on the affective components of events, objects and actions. (No claims are made about the lives of others.) Here, filming is to follow affects and to produce further affects. To follow affects, does not mean to be affected by an idea or a subject, but to be mesmerized by materiality, by the sounds of the running camera and by following the movement of things that are being filmed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vUhf3lfrceu4s0zY29Imeo4dtBO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
