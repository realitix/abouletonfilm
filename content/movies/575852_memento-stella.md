He overwhelms us with his universe, which is built up of countless images, figurative and non-figurative, accompanied by an equally sophisticated soundtrack. At times very abstract and distant, at others almost palpable and narrative. We naturally seek recognition in the infinite layering of the images, and in so doing compose our own story, based on what we ourselves know of the world, using our personal references to help us. In this way, a work arises unique to every viewer, which continues to reverberate long after we leave the cinema.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bjDZJrExq0ILGnfHgAt3S3bXBE0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
