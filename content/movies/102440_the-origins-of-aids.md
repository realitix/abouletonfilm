Two filmmakers explore a controversial theory about the beginnings of the disease. Using interviews, newsreel footage, and documented research experiments, The Origin of AIDS examines how a combination of benevolence, careless lab procedures, and the need of a desperate few to cover their tracks could have led to one of the most serious pandemics of the 20th century.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vnpAd5hW14NGxhZ9VQ9eHUpBO7c.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
