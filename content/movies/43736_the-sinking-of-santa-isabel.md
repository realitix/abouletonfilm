He heads to his childhood home and climbs up a tree, where he plans to stay the entire summer in a house of his own creation. Not surprisingly, Webster captures the attention of his neighbors, who soon find that they have a stake in his mission as well. Jacob and Michael Hamblin helm this quirky comedy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xNLtBxocO8j4kDatadPnQnxsCkS.jpg", "actors": ["Jake Suazo (Peter)", "Maclain Nelson (Webster)", "Brandon Luke Bringhurst (Jester)", "Susanne Sutchy (Beth)", "Bus Riley (Mr. Clark)", "Delmar Derricott (Dwayne)", "Rowene Thomas (Buena)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
