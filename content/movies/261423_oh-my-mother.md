My Mother was the first work I made using a newly bought 16mm camera I had purchased with the writer Shuji Terayama in Paris. This piece was selected for the Oberhausen International Film Festival. In 1969, there were, of course, no video cameras like ones we see now, and color TVs were only found at broadcast television studios. I had just been employed at the TBS (Tokyo Broadcasting System), and I often snuck into the studios after hours to experiment with the equipment. Oh! My Mother was made using the feedback effect, which is produced by infinitely expanding the image by looping the video.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/35iDeVqs5zjGGEViTwefQWa3dSg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
