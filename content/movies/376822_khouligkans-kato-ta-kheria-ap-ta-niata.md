His parents are preparing a party to celebrate this occasion. George spoils the evening by appearing dressed like a woman as a reaction to the rotten modern society. After a fight with his parents he leaves home and teams up with the \"Hooligans\", a bunch of punks that cause trouble at football games and destroy everything that stands in their way. One night during a fight, George breaks his spine and as doctors say, he will never walk again. His father starts investigating by himself and finds out that the hooligans are lead by a Nazi organization that take advantage of the whole chaotic situation in order to gain power! When the hooligans learn about the manipulation, they go after the fascists.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bgofFLt1QdO0LH8ZBA8NbLfIJoq.jpg", "actors": ["Giorgos Kyrlidis (Giorgos)", "Katiana Balanika (Ira)", "Petros Zarkadis (Savvas)", "Giorgos Siskos (Dr. Stavrou)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
