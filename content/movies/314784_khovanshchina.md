A moody opera that is thematically broad at times and intimately personal in others, \"Khovanshchina\" tells the story of the 17th-century clash between Russian conservatives and Peter the Great's reformists. Among the singers is renowned basso Nicolai Ghiaurov and Paata Burchuladze, as well as Anatoly Kocherga, Ludmila Semtchuk, and Heinz Zednik.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/svfwEqrn4HajaHiWF9ISkU96xhb.jpg", "actors": ["Claudio Abbado (Conductor)", "Vladimir Atlantov (Prince Andrey Khovansky)", "Paata Burchuladze (Dositheus)", "Anatoly Kocherga (The Boyar Shaklovity)", "Yuri Marusin (Prince Vassily Golitsin)", "Ludmila Semtschuk (Marfa)", "Nicolai Ghiaurov (Prince Ivan Khovansky)", "Heinz Zednik (Scribe)", "Brigitte Poschner-Klebel (Susanna)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
