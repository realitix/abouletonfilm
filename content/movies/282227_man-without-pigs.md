He returns to the Binandere clan and his small village of Tabara in the Northern Province of PNG. Once there, he has to organise a celebration for his achievements with his family\u2019s help. Since he has been away for most of his life, he has no recognised wealth in the village (the pigs used for gift giving), nor a network of supporters or knowledge of the preparation and rituals for having such a celebration. He wants the event to happen quickly but that\u2019s not the way it works in Tabara. Man without pigs focuses on the antagonism aroused by the clash between traditional customs and Western values in this remote PNG community.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ii3K2uViIgVKlD4lPErDfR7V7hO.jpg", "actors": ["John Waiko (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
