The pianist has a new hair-do in every scene he is in, all designed to help him see the piano. One fat musician nonchalantly wanders in in the midst of the concert, takes off his hat, coat, muffler and gloves, unpacks his instrument, a triangle, hits one note, repacks, puts on his gloves, muffler, coat and hat, and goes home.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
