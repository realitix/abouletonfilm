A long take presents, in a far-fetched sequence, the four meteorological elements which befall the different portions of the ruins. The four musical instruments, performing the quartet, cease to be an ensemble and become, individually, the audio tracks corresponding to each of weather. So the sound of the first violin drips as the rain, that one of the second violin is snow-muffled, the sound of the viola moves like the wind and that one of the cello reverberates like inside the fog.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aRwnIppPM9kgATnUbCr4ca6lvHy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
