Mike Connors, publicity man for Frankie Carle's orchestra, invites her to try out as the band's vocalist since the regular singer, Mary Lou, had just quit the band on the eve of an engagement at a swanky New York night club. Encouraged by her boyfriend, Steve Roberts, Ann lands the job and assumes the name of \"Mary Lou\", a trademark almost for Frankie Carle singers. But the departed Mary Lou shows up and threatens to sue if she is not rehired. Ann returns to her former job. Meanwhile, Steve locates the woman who was the original Mary Lou with the band, and urges Mike to keep the current Mary Lou off the bandstand until he can return with Ann.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lQ0j5jpyZLFCsiUkdWDLOnSh9WZ.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Lowery (Steve Roberts)", "Joan Barton (Ann Parker, aka Mary Lou)", "Glenda Farrell (Winnie Winford)", "Frank Jenks (Mike Connors)", "Thelma White (Eve Summers)", "Abigail Adams (First Mary Lou)", "Chester Clute (Cheever Chesney)", "Emmett Vogan (Murray Harris)", "Pierre Watkin (Airline President)", "Charles Jordan (Mortimer Cripps)", "Frankie Carle (Band Leader Frankie Carle (as Frankie Carle and His Piano))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
