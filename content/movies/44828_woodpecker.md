Declared extinct in the 1940\u2019s, the bird has apparently been spotted by numerous experts. Enter amateur birder and poet Johnny Neander, who has convinced his taciturn sidekick that he will be the one to find the elusive woodpecker. The ensuing chaos divides the small town between believers and non-believers, rabid environmentalists and opportunistic entrepreneurs. Much like the bird itself, Woodpecker explores the intersection of fact and fiction, manipulating our notions of documentary and narrative techniques within a tragic comedy about hope, perception, and some very very strange birds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5RA4N58e4Jox40EZcpdAYkXdXAX.jpg", "actors": ["Jon Hyrns (Johnny)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
