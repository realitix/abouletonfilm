Tiersen says he wanted to fix the moment, immortalize it on film as something freshly created with each of his different collaborators, Jane Birkin, Liz Frazer (of Cocteau Twins), Stuart Staples (of Tindersticks), Dominique A and Christophe Miossec. A musical documentary where you see the musicians struggling with the computer, fine-tuning the recording, smoking a cigarette against the sea spray of Ouessant or riding a scooter down the island's pebbly tracks.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/myvLaSXnDYRgF74vRgUqqe2o2n4.jpg", "actors": ["Yann Tiersen (Yann Tiersen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "a0SdZa5e4AM"}
