It was created in Brazil mainly by descendants of African slaves with Brazilian native influences, probably beginning in the 16th century. It is known by quick and complex moves, using mainly power kicks and quick leg sweeps, with some ground and aerial acrobatics, knee strikes, take-downs, elbow strikes, punches and headbutts. The word capoeira comes from Tupi, referring to the areas of low vegetation in the Brazilian interior.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xUcCAYmctORTyIc0WysPWr7MVhd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
