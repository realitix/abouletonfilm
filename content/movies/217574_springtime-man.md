A morbid turn of events brings Haruo (Jacky Woo) to the squalor of Manila. A prized asset of the feared Yakuza in Tokyo, Haruo, aka Tadano Hayashi, escapes the criminal syndicate with bountiful cash, a helpless Filipina bar girl (Nina Kodaka) \u2013 and tragic consequences. Now solitary, he has uprooted himself to the railside slums of the metropolis, wistfully fending for himself. Still hiding from his past, he rents out a small room, seemingly lost in the clutter of wandering souls desperate for survival. There, he spends his days anonymously roaming the congested streets selling food, and even giving them away for the hungry. But he mostly keeps to himself, even to the inquisitive Edna (Rosanna Roces), an aging bar girl with whom he occasionally shares his bed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k5L14n9k5LDXkCjS9HlnxK5iZAE.jpg", "actors": ["Jacky Woo ()", "Rosanna Roces ()", "Perla Bautista ()", "Evelyn Vargas ()", "Roxanne Barcelo ()", "Jun-jun Quitana ()", "Nina Kodaka ()", "Arnold Reyes ()", "Angeli Bayani ()", "Pamela Juan ()", "Samuel Quintana ()", "Okame Tsutomu ()", "Takeda Hiroshi ()", "Sakaguchi Yuki ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
