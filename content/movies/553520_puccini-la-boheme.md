Taking up these scenes of Bohemian life, Puccini offers us a heart-breaking love story and some of the most beautiful music in the history of opera in the story of the poet Rodolfo and fragile Mimi. The staging of this new production has been entrusted to Claus Guth who sets the drama in a future devoid of hope in which love and art become the sole means of transcendence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1b79gVrL2pIXJiof8z1crlR6807.jpg", "actors": ["Sonya Yoncheva (Mim\u00ec)", "Atalla Ayan (Rodolfo)", "Artur Rucinski (Marcelo)", "Alessio Arduini (Schaunard)", "Roberto Tagliavini (Colline)", "Aida Garifullina (Musetta)", "Gustavo Dudamel (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
