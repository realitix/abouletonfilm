This did not make foreigners of any stripe very popular, and those from \"guest worker\" countries were particularly disliked. In this film, set in 1938, a half-Polish boy goes to Poland in search of his mother, runs into financial and psychological difficulties there, and is sent back to a Swedish mental hospital. In another story, an unfortunate woman suffers a miscarriage and ends up at the asylum where the Polish boy is being kept.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z4PQraAANxR72YjzT76LyoRp18J.jpg", "actors": ["Anders \u00c5berg (Eije Str\u00f6m)", "Grazyna Brattander (Polish whore)", "Gerissa Jalander (Mother)", "Bo Lindstr\u00f6m (Albin Str\u00f6m)", "Tomas Norstr\u00f6m (farm worker)", "Emy Storm (Gerda)", "Jan Dolata ()", "Jan J\u00f6nsson ()", "Anne-Lie Kinnunen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
