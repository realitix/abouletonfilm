De la Pera was a talented photographer, always willing to try new gadgets and techniques. This film experiments with microphotography in the style of Jean Comandon's films for Path\u00e9 and it is part of a series which included a film about mosquitoes and paludism and another one about cancer, which are considered lost. Flies were a popular subject of silent films and there are more than a dozen titles featuring them in the teens and early twenties.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vCSAsxJIPdLrz0YlWrBWjnNDUEA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "QWRxm0JQiAk"}
