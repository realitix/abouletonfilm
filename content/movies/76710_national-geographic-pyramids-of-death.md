But it wasn't the pharaohs that built these pyramids. This is the majestic ancient city of Teotihuac\u00e1n, Mexico, home to one of the most powerful civilizations of its time. But why, around 750 AD, did the advanced civilization that created Teotihuac\u00e1n suddenly vanish? The identities of its founders, the language they spoke and even the original name of the city are all unknown. DNA analysis of bodies from Teotihuac\u00e1n shows they weren't Mayan, Incan or Aztec, but an entirely different civilization. It was assumed to have been a peaceful, utopian society, but the latest discoveries are revealing a much darker scenario. In the depths of Teotihuac\u00e1n's pyramids, experts have uncovered vault after vault filled with curious human remains.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wopgixGjBmQZBZWJJ7Bok4oufB3.jpg", "actors": ["Salvatore Vecchio (Narrator)", "Manuel Poncelis ()", "Martin Gutierrez ()", "Roberto Zuniga ()", "Fransisco Zuniga ()", "Julio Rivera ()", "Hugo Morales ()", "Cresencio Cruz ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "soh7IUHxd4E"}
