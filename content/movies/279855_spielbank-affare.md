With her winnings from the roulette table, she attempts to finance her studies. Despite a rather lucky streak, her winnings are a little on the lean side. She doesn't, however, gamble with her own money but with that of Dr. Busch, a lawyer, who likes to stay in the background with the argument that gambling houses are not the proper turf for a serious lawyer. From him, Sybille receives only a small share of her winnings later, and only through the intervention of Gerhard Fischer, a journalist, does Sybille come to realize her role in Dr. Busch's fraudulent scheme.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z2aapzZsm5kMYkIVfPd78HBw6sQ.jpg", "actors": ["Gertrud K\u00fcckelmann (Sybille)", "Jan Hendriks (Gerhard)", "Peter Pasetti (Dr. Busch)", "Rudolf Forster (Gallinger)", "Willy A.
