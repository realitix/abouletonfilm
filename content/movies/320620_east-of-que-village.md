East of Que Village considers the impact of Chinese industrialisation and urbanisation on rural communities, casting fresh light on those neglected by the new social-economic paradigm. The dogs, which literally have to eat each other to survive are juxtaposed with a group of villagers who struggle in the same ways. The work reflects the sense of isolation and loss increasingly present in Chinese society as communities are scattered, traditional rural villages are dissolved, and the fight for survival takes hold. The work's title signals to the only road leading from the village to the outside world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mCJ9Bl4Q7dy5bPqIQlAsuDUX0Xi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
