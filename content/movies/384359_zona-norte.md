Over the years Yvonne has developed a new pedagogy that helps children who are traumatized by violence to overcome their experiences and the resulting learning problems. The children we portrayed 15 years ago are now young adults. They report from their lives in the most dangerous favela in the north of the city. They are the living proof that an alternative pedagogy is capable to break the vicious circle of poverty and violence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kHdAzlWMTu5e7zSiiIuQuwHnOrH.jpg", "actors": ["Yvonne Bezerra de Mello (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
