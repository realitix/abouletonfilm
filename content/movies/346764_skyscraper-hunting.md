They looked like humans, but they weren't. The ASH can be identified by a pulsating appendage on their back; it resembles an embossed root clutching the spine. These humanoid creatures have the power to destroy telepathically via a deadly impulse which hemorrhages brain cells. Their goal is to populate the planet via random sexual contact and then take control. There are special police units who fight the ASH. This top secret organization is called The Society For Environment Protection and its agents are called psychosists", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yuK61z4FawezdKHlo6Gn0guRKTC.jpg", "actors": ["Akira Okamori (Bohachi Hijikata)", "Shingo Kazami ()", "Hiroshi Tsuburaya ()", "Hiroshi Shimizu ()", "Kenji Fukuda (Rai)", "Nahoko Aizawa (Midori Saegusa)", "Saki Kurihara ()", "Minken Karasawa ()", "Michihiro Yamanishi ()", "Tomomi Nishimura ()", "Masami Horiuchi ()", "Mio Takaki (Kaori Himi)", "Kikuo Kaneuchi (Narration (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
