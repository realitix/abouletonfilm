During the weekend of Thanksgiving, aliens put their plans to take over the Earth in motion. Two friends, Mike and Jesse (Megan Frankovich and Ben Johnson), appear to be the only thing to stand it the way, if it wasn't for the fact they are somewhat clueless to the invasion. But with a little help from an over the top grump (Jayme Schmitt) they may just have what it takes to get a clue and fight back. In the true style of the 1950s genre of Science Fiction and Horror, you never saw this one coming!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hixh719ZSsCS2jGBiJDZnkaxADN.jpg", "actors": ["Megan Frankovich (Mike)", "Ben Johnson (Jesse)", "Meghan Behning (Lizzy)", "Tara Verdia (Admiral Pike)", "Tori Hermsen (Brittney)", "Jayme Schmitt (Steve Spencer)", "Cherokee Mello (Brian)", "Raine Schmitt (Rebeka)", "Sara Schroeder (Carlie)", "Callie Westcott (Venessa)", "Christopher Wolf (Bob)", "Zachary Smith (Rick)", "Jeff Doerr (Officer Bill)", "Brian Wilhelm (Officer)", "Brooke Fangmann (Spaceship A.I.)", "Nathen Cox (Mormon #1)", "Edward Brown (Mormon #2)", "Eryka Ysquierdo (Alien Soldier)", "Paul Kurutsides (Alien Soldier)", "Mary Beecher (Alien Soldier)", "Emma Mentley (Alien Soldier)", "Sarah Oberbroeckling (Alien Soldier)", "Daniele Halfhill (Alien Soldier)", "Kelli Schubert (Alien Soldier)", "John P.
