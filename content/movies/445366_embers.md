Stepanyan visits the elder Tamara\u2019s hometown in Armenia, where she spends time with her grandmother\u2019s circle of friends, who discuss their memories of daily life with Tamara, bringing to light their ideological and political viewpoints in the process. As the conversations progress, a dialogue emerges between past and present \u2013 between the Tamara of today and the Tamara of two generations ago, whose life was shaped by her experiences during World War II. Despite the absence of the film\u2019s central subject, her presence is deeply felt through her impact on those who survived her. Stepanyan\u2019s mourning the loss of someone close to her heart is acutely apparent; here, she faces down that sorrow with a bright tribute to a wonderful woman.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gVZp9XvzzYe3nuxWALPYv4tU8bT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
