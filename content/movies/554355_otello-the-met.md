He understood how to combine Shakespeare\u2019s rich characterization and Verdi\u2019s dramatic music to create an overwhelming figure, one whose death left audiences deeply shaken. Vickers is perfectly partnered by James Levine\u2019s conducting and the Met\u2019s sensational orchestra and chorus. Renata Scotto is an appealing Desdemona, Cornell MacNeil is a menacing Iago, and Franco Zeffirelli\u2019s production is deservedly legendary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sQsb0TotolIJ1MSmcnrNUGxCYzh.jpg", "actors": ["Jon Vickers ()", "Renata Scotto ()", "Cornell MacNeil ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
