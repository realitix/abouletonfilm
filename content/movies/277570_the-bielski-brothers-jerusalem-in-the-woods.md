Using archival records, historic analysis and compelling interviews with surviving members of the Bielski Brigade, the film paints a fascinating portrait of these largely unsung heroes.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
