Its first ever Royal Opera staging, by Associate Director of Opera John Fulljames, is sung in English, and conducted by Mark Wigglesworth \u2013 recently announced as the successor to Edward Gardner as Music Director of English National Opera.  Mahagonny is a satire on money, morality and pleasure-seeking among the dubious citizens of a fictional city. The richly varied, jazz-infused score, influenced by ragtime music, includes such irresistible melodies as the \u2018Alabama Song\u2019 and many dramatic ensembles.  The superb cast includes Kurt Streit as the wild lumberjack Jimmy, Christine Rice as his sweetheart Jenny, Anne Sofie von Otter in a welcome return to The Royal Opera as the cunning Leokadja Begbick, and Peter Hoare and Willard W. White as her helpers and fellow-fugitives Fatty and Moses.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4e4WjpvDgbVruTd6H735xp0yoo7.jpg", "actors": ["Anne Sofie von Otter (Leokadja Begbick)", "Peter Hoare (Fatty)", "Willard White (Trinity Moses)", "Christine Rice (Jenny Smith)", "Kurt Streit (Jimmy MacIntyre)", "Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts (Jack O'Brien)", "Darren Jeffrey (Bank Account Billy)", "Neal Davies (Alaska Wolf Joe)", "Toby Higgins (Hugh Francis)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
