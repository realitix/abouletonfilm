Proceeding from the observation that television in the Caribbean is overwhelmed by US and French programs, this film ambitiously weaves together interviews, indigenous poetry and music with clips from imported French and US television programs to show how Caribbean viewers receive a distorted view of the world that alienates them from their own cultural heritage. Also included is a glimpse of how Cuba has tackled the problem, featuring an interview with Cuban film director Tom\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez Alea, and the US response in the form of Radio and TV Marti. This is part of the Developing Stories Series on Environment and Development. Starweek Magazine called it \"An astonishingly searing look at TV.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6RYfpbYjjkLVU1cLpQAELJb6TvN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
