His idea of fun is to get his hands on as much free alcohol as he can, and as a result of his carelessness he and his daughter are constantly separated. Each time they reunite, he finds a new group of people for a few more drinks, and another round starts -- as a consequence, there is no build-up to the climax at the end.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wdv9u01lnLVrwCtlGCyU3J5j1f5.jpg", "actors": ["Cas Enklaar ()", "Tara Fallaux ()", "Helen Hedy ()", "Emile Fallaux ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
