As Adam Borowski, Stuhr plays a government lawyer prosecuting a variety of cases, including smuggling, theft, child abandonment, and racially motivated assault. However, Adam's own life is hardly a model by which to live. He's overextended himself financially and is trying to figure out how to avoid paying the hospital bills for his terminally ill mother. Adam is married, but he's been having an affair for some time, and, while he breaks off his relationship with his mistress, he's easily tempted into other liaisons. His wife wants to adopt a handicapped child; Adam would prefer not to have another child in the house, and he uses his influence to slow up the paperwork. And in order to reduce his tax bill, Adam has involved himself in a charitable donation scheme of dubious legality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zfHk6RTW9j9awwH83VrO90IE3xr.jpg", "actors": ["Jerzy Stuhr (Adam Borowski)", "Gosia Dobrowolska (Anna Borowski)", "Danuta Szaflarska (Adam's Mother)", "Alex Mozdzynski (Dominik)", "Ewa Skibi\u0144ska (Adam's Mistress)", "Krzysztof Stroi\u0144ski (Oles)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
