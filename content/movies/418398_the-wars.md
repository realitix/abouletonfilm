'Madame Edwarda' is a story with no beginning nor an end. A male first-person narrator and a prostitute encounter in Paris by night. It's a story about lust, power, anxiety, desire, and humiliation. Van Alphen uses Bataille's text as a metaphor for the perversity of social structures, for the uncontrollability of political and economic power, and the effects of these on human dignity. He juxtaposes pictures from the decaying and almost deserted industrial regions in Northern France and of the 1968 student rebellion in Paris, with the pornographic text from the first years of World War II.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/khH6HcZruhKVZ6WG4fWnBRvs9YX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
