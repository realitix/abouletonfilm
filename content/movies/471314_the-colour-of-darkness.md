A proud Indian international student is attacked in a brightly lit train carriage against a backdrop of darkness. Unknown to his attackers his high caste status has little relevance, and in one poignant moment, he is rescued by his counterpart, an 'untouchable', a low caste. They are united by what would otherwise be impossible. The highly publicised event sends shock waves through the international community.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oCvYsjiIFl7PYmITF7gFHpNAtwj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "5g-ezea3zKg"}
