Barren sands and endless gales proved too much for human settlement on this island off the coast of Nova Scotia. Only a small group of researchers and maintenance people occupy the island; horses run wild, seals and birds multiply profusely, and the Ipswich sparrow has found a fruitful breeding ground for itself. Sable Island provides a perfect opportunity to observe nature in an untouched, organic laboratory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9FclY8bQBn9JdcgYKlXtdqfQC0.jpg", "actors": ["Fred Davis (Host)", "Julien Talbot (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
