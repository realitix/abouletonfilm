One of a missing young man with Asperger's Syndrome who seeks refuge in the underground labyrinth of NYC. The other follows a gambling Ecuadorian livery driver & a Chinese woman desperate to get home to her sick child. Along each of their journeys through the urban landscape, they discover the deeper understanding of communication & their intimate connections despite their barriers. H.O.M.E. is an understated yet lyrical exploration of urban alienation & meaningful encounters through the lens of a \"disconnected\" city in constant motion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oK1QIZtQuhWB7IEivFX5HGiA7kX.jpg", "actors": ["Jes\u00fas Ochoa (Gabriel)", "Jeremy Ray Valdez (Danny)", "Angela Lin (Sze Wun)", "Carlo Alban (Manny (voice))", "Lauren Augarten (Carly)", "Al Thompson (MTA Employee)", "Karen Lynn Gorney (Waitress)", "Lino Del Core (Hasidic Man)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
