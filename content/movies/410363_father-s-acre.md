A convict (Janos Derzsi) returns home after a long stretch in prison to a less than enthusiastic welcome; his son (Tamas Ravasz), now in his late teens, was left to fend for himself and tend the family farm on his own after his dad went away, and the youngster blames his father for his mother's untimely death. The father wants to mend his relationship with his son, but the young man makes no secret of his contempt for his dad, and only grudgingly allows him back on the farm.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qXOn8BffDYMWvukI8rlatDrjAtT.jpg", "actors": ["Tam\u00e1s Ravasz ()", "Andrea Nagy ()", "J\u00e1nos Derzsi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
