This ultra rare gem has him starring alongside Matthew Dunster and Pearce Quiggley as they try to rob a local pub of their evening\u2019s takings. With Kay as the getaway driver though hilarity, and thoroughly unsuccessful robbery, soon ensues.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uJYNaOmsMK2DaYn1lePDkis0S4c.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Kay (George)", "Pearce Quigley (Brian)", "Alexei Sayle (Bernie)", "Paul Shane (Ernie)", "Lynda Baron (Moureen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
