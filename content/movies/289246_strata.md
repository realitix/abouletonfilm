As writer Krumbachova stated: \"With nature as a prison, an impassable barrier ... where every action is physically and psychically limited by the environment ... people are reduced to fragments of basic instinct and intelligence.\" Promoted as a psychological thriller, Strata provides little tension nor any real climax. The characters are ideas - not believably real.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xgFH24UbYMx3wTr0q9bLrz3XnfA.jpg", "actors": ["Nigel Davenport (Victor)", "John Banas (Steve)", "Judy Morris (Margaret)", "Tom Brennan (Eric)", "Roy Billing (Keith)", "Peter Nicoll (Tony)", "Mary Regan (Gaylene)", "Ctibor Turba (Thomas)", "Patrick Smyth (Quarantine Doctor)", "Norman Forsey (Dr Hunter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
