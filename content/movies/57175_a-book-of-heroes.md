As in most of these Taiwanese films, slapstick comedy alternates with intense action. An absurd plot has something to do with missing bullion and a treasure map. Yamashita\u2019s gang wants it, and so do an unlikely band of heroes, including an incompetent traffic cop, his cop wannabe girl friend, and a couple of card sharks who have teamed up with an infatuated gas station owner. Some of Taiwan\u2019s best action actors provide excellent kung fu action.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gYl6vtup6nymm1wOGBkKx4PfX7y.jpg", "actors": ["Yang Hui-shan (Yang Shan Shan)", "Yasuaki Kurata (Yamashita sensei)", "Yukari \u00d4shima (Yamashita's fighter)", "Pauline Lan (Little Mei)", "David Tao (David)", "Cheung Aau-Tang (Little Rat)", "Fong Ching (Ah Fang)", "Bin Bin (Little fighter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "dVmKza0EYYA"}
