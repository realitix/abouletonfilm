Firmin, J\u00e9r\u00f4me's servant, asks Claude, a Montmartre artist, to organize the reunion, to find the sum of 17 million francs which is hidden there (as a child he had been told by Armandy where the hiding place was) and to divide the amount between the different heirs. But a series of odd facts occur: Claude is knocked unconscious as he is busy opening the hiding place door; one of the heirs gets killed; and even more astounding, the dead man reappears and... asks his money back!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/18x4i5EB0yEKW45Y9HhnniKSTva.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
