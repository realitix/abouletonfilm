Using the threat of arresting them for their lack of a retail license for their merchandise and the resulting unpaid taxes, he forces them to agree to cooperate in a sting to break a gun running ring. They have an initial success, but that brings new problems as the ring's leader brings in a merciless assassin to eliminate these new enemies. It will take all their skill, allies and some luck to come out this crisis alive.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fLMhdvOYfPNS90jmQ0uNflSt7ul.jpg", "actors": ["Michiko Neya (Rally Vincent (voice))", "Kae Araki (\"Minnie\" May Hopkins (voice))", "H\u014dch\u016b \u014ctsuka (Bill Collins (voice))", "Aya Hisakawa (Becky Farrah (voice))", "Seiz\u014d Kat\u014d (Senator Edward Haintz (voice))", "Michihiro Ikemizu (George Black (voice))", "Yoko Soumi (Natasha Radinov (voice))", "Akiko Hiramatsu (Cathy (voice))", "Daisuke Gouri (Jonathan Washington (voice))", "Ikuya Sawaki (Roy Coleman (voice))", "Kenichi Ono (Gray (voice))", "Toranori Yoshikawa (Jody (voice))", "Youhei Tadano (Police Officer (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [45279, 96650, 45278, 72016], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
