Amateur film enthusiasts - soldiers, tourists, Hitler's own pilot, even Hitler's mistress, Eva Braun - began experimenting with color film in the late 1930s, their camera eye recording the Third Reich from every angle. Some of this film was only recently uncovered in former Soviet-bloc archives, hidden for almost 60 years; all of it, thanks to digital technology, has been newly transferred to video with surprising clarity. (This documentary was produced with two different narratives, both an English and German language version.)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bhfixgnFWuBWkbXEVWqZ0sntjpZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [48894], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
