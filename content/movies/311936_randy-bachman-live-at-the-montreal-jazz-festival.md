Captured on film, this concert features Randy revisiting his jazz roots and trading licks with fellow guitar great Duke Robillard among other musical guests. A spectacular set includes some jazz standards, Bachman style, and some of Bachman's biggest hits, showcasing his virtuosic guitar playing. This evening is also historic as it was the last recorded show at the Spectrum, which closed its doors shortly after this and was demolished.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Randy Bachman ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
