It features Elvira Kurt, a Second City alum named Canadian Female Comic of the Year and writer for Ellen DeGeneres; Sabrina Matthews, a regularly featured performer on Comedy Central; Renee Hicks, the first African- American woman nominated Best Female Stand-up at the American Comedy Awards; and the Southern-Baptist-lesbian-mom-turned-crossover-comic, Vickie Shaw. This film takes a \"reality\" approach to showcasing the comics, capturing their on-stage performances, and their personas off-stage in behind-the-scenes footage, one-on-one interviews and recurring segments where all four converge for spontaneous and improvised discourse.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kMsmro9nOkfG0ihuFvECBqNUCuE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
