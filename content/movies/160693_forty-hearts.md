At gigantic expense and effort, the Soviet Union is rapidly industrialised. The state plan foresees the construction of forty power-generation centres across the country. However, the people must first be enlightened about the nature and use of electrical current. Horses and tractors, households and industry, nature and the world of work, neon signs and the construction of power stations all depend on this miraculous new source of energy. The famous Soviet director Lev Kuleshov masterfully realises this project with documentary shots, acted scenes, and lots of creative trick sequences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pPREYvXfozi1NBMKOzAsAwVwKxn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
