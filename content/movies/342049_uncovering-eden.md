However, Edie finds her grandmother\u2019s words constricting and tries to separate herself from what she thinks is the problem: her Jewish faith.  At school, Edie wants to fit in with the popular crowd, particularly because of a boy named Darren whom she has feelings for. But Darren and his friends, June and Chad are not the most tolerable of people and their prejudices toward others not like themselves; drive Edie in a downward spiral.  As Edie struggles to find her way through adolescence, faith, and her first love, she learns that her actions have consequences and perhaps the steep slope she has chosen to go down will risk more than she ever thought possible.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
