King Minos is married to the vulgar and voracious Queen Scylla. Minos discovers that his long-lost niece is the rightful ruler of Greece and...plans on having his servant Pandora use her charms to distract Theseus from his mission and lead him to the land of the Amazons where, hopefully, he\u2019ll most certainly be killed. Meanwhile, on Mount Olympus, Zeus is in search of a \u201cgullible schnook\u201d to guard a wooden chest \u201cfull of trouble\u201d and decides Theseus is the man for the job.
