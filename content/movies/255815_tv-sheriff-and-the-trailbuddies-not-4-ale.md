They have since taken their unique act to venues worldwide, providing animated commentary on the state of mind control in the USA. The Trailbuddies focus on the banality of television, creating rhythmic collages from appropriated clips of the most absurd broadcast moments. And besides their virtuoso sampling, the madcap ensemble creates original\u2014and hilarious!\u2014karaoke-style melodies on mass-media manipulation.  Behind TV Sheriff &amp; The Trailbuddies is the ingenious, Emmy-award-nominated Davy Force, an exceptional combination of brilliant director and hands-on computer artist. His recent projects include music videos for Devo, animated commercials for Bandai and the show open for Tim &amp; Eric's Awesome Show Great Job.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/20s18durv3zUFj8zeyglcpKiCQt.jpg", "actors": ["Dave Foss (TV Sheriff)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "qrQl_dz7IKk"}
