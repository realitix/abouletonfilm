Featuring Star Wars ripoffs, Star Wars TV specials, Star Wars commercials, Star Wars interviews and even shameless Star Wars pornography [rated R].  It\u2019s Star Wars gone wild, gone weird and gone wrong, and there\u2019s nothing else like it.  C-3PO rapping?  It\u2019s here. Mark Hamill turns into a homicidal maniac?  Yep, we got it.  Jabba the Hutt Italo disco? Check. Tusken Raider Voyeur Pornography? Oh yeah, and lots of it. You\u2019ve never seen Star Wars like this and you\u2019ll never see Star Wars quite the same way after watching.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/50Xf9wCG3OK2xvaEnZO7ZcmlPCa.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
