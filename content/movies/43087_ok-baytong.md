He even must learn to ride a bicycle and zip up his trousers without injuring himself. He is confronted by a flood of feelings - sexual, for a woman and family friend across the street; as well as fear and hatred for the Muslims, who he believes is responsible for his sister's death and other sorrows in his life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tTl5PhoZViFguCUIrvx5PUGP2rU.jpg", "actors": ["Phoovarit Phumpuang (Tum)", "Chiranan Manochaem (Lynn)", "Saranya Kruengsai ()", "Attaporn Teemakorn ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "K46kLVEoRm0"}
