Turner is widely recognised as England\u2019s greatest painter. Tate has the world\u2019s finest and most extensive collection of his work. Turner at Tate explores Turner\u2019s art through many of his best-known canvases and exquisite sketches and watercolours, all newly and exceptionally filmed in HDTV from the original artworks.  Incorporating the landscapes and places that inspired the works, the film provides an overview of Turner\u2019s life and - in an accessible and engrossing way - of critical approaches to his art. The film\u2019s focus is Turner and England, and his work is considered against the radical social and political changes of the early nineteenth century. Turner at Tate is a film about ideas and history and landscape, a film about colour and light.  Contributors include Tate curators Ian Warrell and David Blayney Brown, and art historians Sam Smiles and Barry Venning. Also featured on the DVD are ten additional short films, each of which considers in detail a major work.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x6BO6NALWQWvIUlh7KbMrjSPIkz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
