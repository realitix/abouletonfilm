Remarkably, her father's epistolary accounts of his daily life as a soldier also include fantastical watercolour illustrations of his travels, which Meter incorporates to movingly amplify the emotional resonance of a father-daughter bond made fraught by distance and war.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sC7RBDPzK80Kl1ffgSMlg6qW5rl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
