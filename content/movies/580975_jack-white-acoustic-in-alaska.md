With the ethereal setting adding to the mystique of the circumstance, the show was one of the most thrilling in White\u2019s twenty-plus-year career, and those who were there to enjoy it (who had waited all day in the snow), bore witness to a once-in-a-lifetime performance. We present that memorable show here, in its entirety, on DVD, with expertly engineered sound and editing by TMR\u2019s in-house film guru Brad Holland. Acoustic in Alaska is truly spectacular.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5ZPE5SsufiZCVJzz9zmmw6X9g86.jpg", "actors": ["Jack White ()", "Dominic Davis ()", "Fats Kaplin ()", "Lillie Mae Rische ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "m0xCNswmcE4"}
