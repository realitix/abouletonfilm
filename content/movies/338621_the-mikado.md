About six scenes from The Mikado are shown, then designer Charles Rickets steps onto the stage with a final look at the costumes and the film ends. The players in the production are legendary Savoyards, well-known from recordings of the period, but this is the only time a movie camera caught them in their roles, though sadly minus the singing. About four nitrate prints of this film are known to exist; two of which are at the BFI in London.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Darrell Fancourt (The Mikado)", "Charles Goulding (Nanki-Poo)", "Henry Lytton (Ko-Ko)", "Leo Sheffield (Pooh-Bah)", "John Huntington (Pish-Tush)", "Elsie Griffin (Yum-Yum)", "Aileen Davies (Pitti-Sing)", "Beatrice Elburn (Peep-Bo)", "Bertha Lewis (Katisha)", "Charles Ricketts ()", "Janet Adair ()", "Herbert Aitken ()", "Josephine Ashley ()", "Marjorie Avona ()", "Henry Blain ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
