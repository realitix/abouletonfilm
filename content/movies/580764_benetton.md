Overloaded front table, sunglasses, cell phones, Viagra (sold by the pill, $10), assorted hot goods. Inaccessible back table, more of same, two 35mm film cans marked BENETTON.  'Excuse me, what's in those cans?' 'Twenty dollars.' 'Is there film in the cans?' 'Twenty dollars.' 'No, I want to know what is in the cans.' 'Twenty dollars.'  Twenty dollars later, four giant 16mm reels, 2 hours of color double-perforated reversal footage, three female models.
