As a primer on gender theory beyond feminism, it's alright; it gets the broad strokes right but fumbles the details and muddles the thesis somewhat. If it weren't the only documentary to tackle this topic, I'd rate it lower, but it gets a bonus point for its originality and guts. It's worth a watch if you care about human rights and equality."}], "recommandations_id": [207699, 34044, 241620, 143481]}
