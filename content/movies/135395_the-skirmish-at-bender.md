The Swedish king Karl XII is waiting in the small village of Bender for the Turkish sulton to help him defeat his arch enemy, the czar of Russia, Peter the Great. But the Turks think he's an expensive guest and want him out of Turkey. However, he refuses. The sultan then decides to send Karl XII a princess to marry him, to get him out of the country (a bride for a bribe). The two Swedish soldiers Lagercrona and Kruus are to escort the princess. They experience many different adventures on their way to Bender, namely because other Swedish soldiers and agents try to stop them from ever reaching the village, because they don't want Karl XII to leave Turkey. After their long adventure to get there and a few misunderstandings, the famous \"kalabalik\" of Bender, where the Turks decide to drive Karl XII out of Turkey by force, begins.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q8hXYvbEKEa9iRlbFAvcNU2AfGH.jpg", "actors": ["G\u00f6sta Ekman (Karl XII)", "Lasse \u00c5berg (F\u00e4nrik Lagercrona)", "Brasse Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m (Kruus)", "Ayse Emel Mesci Kuray (Sirene)", "Sten Ljunggren (\u00d6verste Grothusen)", "Lars Amble (Pastor Agrell)", "Carl-Gustaf Lindstedt (Taffelt\u00e4ckare Hultman)", "Sture Hovstadius (General Lagercrona)", "Nils Ahlroth (Doktor Skragge)", "Donald Arthur (Ambassad\u00f6r Poniatowski)", "Walter Gotell (Storvesiren)", "Rozita Auer (Belly dancer)", "Ann-Sofie Kylin (Elin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
