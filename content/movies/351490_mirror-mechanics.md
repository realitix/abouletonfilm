This film reports on cinema and the processes within it. In doing so, it doesn't reveal any secrets, but instead, attempts to transfer \u2013 in the sense of seeing what we see \u2013 what we do in the cinema and what also can be relevant outside of film into a visually stimulating and captivating event.\" (Siegfried A.
