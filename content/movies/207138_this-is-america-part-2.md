This film goes inside the real America circa 1980 - a world of punks, orgies and worm-eating hicks! Romano Vanderbes back on the film making side and Norman Rose back on narrating duty for the second of the This Is America trilogy. Things kick off slightly louder this time with a performance by The Dictators doing a version of America the Beautiful while the titles role, then right into piece about punk star Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedy's running for mayor of San Francisco. Then back into a more This Is America feeling segment about a crazy fat bloke called Captain Sticky. Among some of the other more interesting segments we get a look at underground vagrants, a piranha attack, martial arts nuns, a family of worm eaters, a drug abusing church and ends with a death row electrocution.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/94xd4C7fZbA0yYeEqge0fxf9iQr.jpg", "actors": ["Jello Biafra (Himself)", "Alice Cooper (Himself (archive footage))", "Charles Manson (Himself (archive footage))", "Vanessa del Rio (Boxer in Red Shorts)", "Veronica Hart (Boxer in Gold Shorts)", "Bo Diddley (Himself)", "Kandi Barbour (Plato's Retreat Swinger)", "Ron Jeremy (Plato's Retreat Swinger)", "Candida Royalle (Plato's Retreat Swinger)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
