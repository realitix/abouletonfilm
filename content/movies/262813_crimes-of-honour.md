They may have lost their virginity, refused an arranged marriage or left an abusive husband. Even if a woman is raped or merely the victim of gossip, she must pay the price.  Crimes of Honour documents the terrible reality of femicide \u2013 the belief that a girl\u2019s body is the property of the family, and any suggestion of sexual impropriety must be cleansed with her blood.  We meet women in hiding from their families, a brother who describes his reasons for killing the sister he loved, and a handful of women who have committed themselves to the protection of young women in danger of losing their lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l73dJ9lAhOntrQ7W2jY5nNvs1Gl.jpg", "actors": ["Olympia Dukakis ()", "Olympia Dukakis (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "b0c0XVI1BpM"}
