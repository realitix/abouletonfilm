So the material, while mostly generated as a diary, is heterogeneous enough to include just about any kind of footage. At one point, a baby cries inconsolably, in another, a boy in a baseball uniform is playing Bach while his mother sits next to him putting on mascara. The 18 minute video montage of impressions has a cumulative effect, accessed and read differently depending on the mental connections the viewer makes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pPPru5zVIMqYDzAini9tMZTfnSf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
