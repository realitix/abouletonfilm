It seems that he has moved back from Canada and cannot afford the tax on the car. The dealership is manned by two. One appears to be the worker of the pair - keeping the cars clean and running. The other is a cookie cutter version of many auto salesmen to be found everywhere in the world. He is Shmuel, the apparent owner of the lot and has seen the same car in a German dealer's catalog priced at \u20ac50,000. He conferences with Siso, the worker of the pair, whose financial support he needs and convinces him to invest in the purchase of the car. In the typical car dealer fashion, Shmuel makes a deal to buy the car from the \"ignorant Arab\" for \u20ac5,000.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rAwk1nLySCixiWNsQCiDfQEAN4q.jpg", "actors": ["Moshe Ivgy (Siso)", "Avi Kushnir (Shmuel)", "Christoph Hagen Dittmann (Son of Car Salesman)", "Stephan Kampwirth (Policeman at Junction)", "Ulrich Matschoss (Old Reception Clerk)", "Hannes Hellmann (Manager Autohaus Decker)", "Konstantin Graudus (Policeman 1 Hotel)", "Rolf Nagel (alter Mann)", "Harald Burmeister (Z\u00f6llner)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
