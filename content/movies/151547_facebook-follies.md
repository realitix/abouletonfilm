Viewers meet people who lost their jobs, their marriages, their dignity, or who even ended up in jail - all because of their own or someone else's Facebook posting. To give a broader context to the events, these stories are intercut with reflections from experts in the areas of social change, internet security and contemporary media.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/teUb3y5O0ZDzzWw5vBXQqAEROQO.jpg", "actors": ["Ann-Marie MacDonald (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
