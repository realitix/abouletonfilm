True to his word, after Joe and Chubby's father leaves, a crazy man starts a train with most of the kids on it, save for Farina who is nearly run over several times.\r Once Farina manages to climb aboard himself, the kids attempt to stop the runaway locomotive, but have no luck until the engine crashes into a grocery truck. As it turns out, however, the entire incident is revealed to be a dream Farina had as Joe and Chubby's father lectured the kids about rail-yard safety.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4HOZQU9b1STG0mhw858OLxZqufJ.jpg", "actors": ["Bobby 'Wheezer' Hutchins (Wheezer)", "Joe Cobb (Joe)", "Allen 'Farina' Hoskins (Farina)", "Mary Ann Jackson (Mary Ann)", "Harry Spear (Harry)", "Norman Chaney (Chubby)", "Jean Darling (Jean)", "Pete the Pup (Petie)", "Helen Jerome Eddy ()", "Ed Brandenburg (Brakeman)", "Mrs. Norman T.
