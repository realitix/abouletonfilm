In the silence, the bros-in-arms distract themselves with jokes. A tohu (sign) brings them back to reality, and they gather to say a karakia before returning to the fray. Director Taika Waititi describes the soldiers as young men with \"a special bond, strengthened by their character, their culture and each other.\" Shot in the rubble of the old Wellington Hospital, Tama T\u016b won international acclaim. Invited to over 40 international festivals, its many awards included honourable mentions at Sundance and Berlin.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vcHUlfoFivVCHYNKG86hgdAf7tr.jpg", "actors": ["Tammy Davis ()", "Taungaroa Emile ()", "Rob Mokaraka ()", "Jarod Rawiri ()", "Te Kohe Tuhaka ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
