Two people meet again in the seaside town where they fell in love as adolescents 20 years earlier while spending their summer vacation there with their families. It could be a chance to rediscover each other and to lend continuity to a relationship that was interrupted, in his case at least, traumatically. But the disquieting presence of her 15 year old daughter insinuates itself between them. He transfers his feelings to the young girl and relives, in a kind of addendum the same feelings that were cut short by the abrupt separation. A three-way relationship is formed, colored by tensions, generational conflicts, and subtile psychological games. Each of the three will emerge from the rapport in their own way. Each will emerge, no doubt, changed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9JTxLDOpe38itf6S23qGx2L1lbb.jpg", "actors": ["Massimo Venturiello (Guido)", "Olga Beaumont (Anna)", "Viola Simoncioni (Susan)", "Giovanni Costa ()", "Francesco Casu ()", "Eleonora De Nurra ()", "Costanzo Dettori ()", "Alba Giordo ()", "Andrea Falchi ()", "Sabrina Idini ()", "Ugo Niedda ()", "Nerina Marta Nieddu ()", "Angelo Padiglia ()", "Siro Pau ()", "Carlo Pinna ()", "Costanzo Pinna ()", "Joele Piras ()", "Maurizio Simbula ()", "Corrado Ughi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
