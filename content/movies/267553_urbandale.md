Filmed at Urbandale Plaza in the eastern suburbs of Buffalo N.Y., \"Urbandale\" is a study of America's suburban sprawl stripped to its barest essentials and void of unnecessary contemporary cultural influence. This film captures the sly, bland smile strip plazas cast at modern culture.  The film, rendered in text, focuses on the repetitive motion of food stuffs being cooked in the lobby of a discount department store.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nB1OXWcZwHZA2pmTRgH0DadJepr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
