When he discovers that a powerful local figure is responsible for his father\u2019s death, Alberto realizes that he\u2019s been summoned by his family to avenge the murder. It\u2019s an unthinkable act \u2014 especially for him, an Evangelical Christian. But as pressure mounts, he sees few ways out. Questions of faith, tradition and honor course through this electrifying film, which, seemingly at the speed of thought itself, jumps between film formats, colors, and aspect ratios, radically envisioning a community torn asunder by senseless violence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5aobAPTPLFsXyN6sPm0l9nwapLH.jpg", "actors": ["Vincente Santos (Alberto)", "Yuberbi de la Rosa (Patria)", "Jos\u00e9 Miguel Fern\u00e1ndez ()", "Kalyane Linares ()", "Enerolisa N\u00fa\u00f1ez (Cantante de salve)", "Judith Rodriguez Perez (Karina)", "Pepe Sierra (Mart\u00ednez)", "Isabel Spencer (Chave)", "Ricardo Ariel Toribio (Asistente de Mart\u00ednez)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
