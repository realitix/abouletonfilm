The film interweaves stories of military doctors, nurses, and medics who are working with skill, compassion, and dedication amid the vortex of the Iraq War; wounded soldiers and marines reacting with courage, dignity, and determination to survive and to heal; and students at Uniformed Services University, the \"West Point\" of military medicine, on their journey toward becoming career military physicians. The film also follows 21-year-old Army Specialist Crystal Davis from Iraq to Germany to Walter Reed Hospital in Washington DC as she fights to recover and \"bounce back\" from the loss of a leg.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
