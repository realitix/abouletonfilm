The focus is on 17-year-old Jessica who is struggling with reconciling the love she has for her father with the hatred she has for his right-wing politics. Instead of a shorter story dealing with this conflict alone, Bontzolakis has drawn attention away to peripheral subjects like the depressed mother of one of Jessica's friends, or the inveterate drinker at the local bar -- interesting, but distracting at the same time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/499XGUCn3vOgTlCFwGNQoJR4nNl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
