Speech varieties from the African American community reflect the imprint of African language systems, the influences of regional British and Southern American dialects, and the creativity and resilience of people living through oppression, segregation and the fight for equality. Filmed across the United States, Talking Black in America is a startling revelation of language as legacy, identity and triumph over adversity. With Reverend Jeremiah Wright, DJ Nabs, Professor Griff, Quest M.C.O.D.Y., Dahlia the Poet, Nicky Sunshine and many others.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pNJ8GSGc8EXDQOJCPHcTuBKuOSx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
