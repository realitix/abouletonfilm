He lives alone among olive trees in southern Italy. One day he decides to cross the sea. Once in Albania, he goes near the location where he had made his last war picture, as if he was retracing his steps. He finds a tree he wants to photograph. He is just about to do so, when he discovers a runaway girl hiding in it with the sole objective of crossing the sea and getting to the other side. The man has no choice. He has to flee with her, follow her and guide her along until a storm separates them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p3RtZl3rwZAlWpOyWOgqomhjLPk.jpg", "actors": ["Carlo Brandt (Jean)", "Kristina Ago (Mira)", "Michele Venitucci (The Priest)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Bpa0r3ISwCI"}
