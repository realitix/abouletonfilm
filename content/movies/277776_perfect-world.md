Described by Elling as a \"visual poem\", and by Laugesen as \"a collage of dreams - of bubbles or planets in the ocean or universe\", the film is very much in the same visually expressive style of The Element Of Crime (indeed, the extent of Elling's contribution to the look of Trier's early works is self-evident).  One of the most intoxicatingly beautiful films I've ever seen - the luminous monochromatic cinematography, hallucinatory lighting and liquid editing make this a truly astonishing experience unlike anything else.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6dG3sAN5vpw15c4Z4VFJZB7qarf.jpg", "actors": ["Anne Mette Rosenkilde ()", "Tabitha Vinten ()", "Marianne T\u00f8nsberg ()", "Julie Heilmann ()", "Rikke Funch ()", "Rasmus Elling ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
