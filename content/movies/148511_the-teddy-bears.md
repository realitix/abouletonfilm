Goldilocks goes to sleep in the bears' home after watching six teddy bears dance and do acrobatics, viewing them through a knothole in the wall. When she is awoken by the returning bear family, they give chase through the woods, but she runs to the aid of the Old Rough Rider, who saves her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dCwOE3eJuw9axhsiGsqOV60B1J2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [147723, 148547, 180139, 131933], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
