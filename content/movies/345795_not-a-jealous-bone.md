The bone represents the promise of youth and hope\u2014a promise jealously coveted by the young, but needed more by those grown old. Inverting cultural values, Condit represents feminine youth as a mannequin, and seeks humanity in the form of the older woman, who is reborn by overcoming her fear of death.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cxdrQsccf2ETGvmhhjCDTBCsviY.jpg", "actors": ["Sophie Finson Wohl ()", "Jill Sands ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
