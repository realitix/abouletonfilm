She claims she is innocent, but to prove it, she must submit to a ritual: trial by fire, walking on fire along a path leading directly to a crucifix. A film that has been much commended for the visual creativity shown by the director in successive blending in of images involving Ursula, her husband, the Virgin Mary, and Jesus Christ. Much applauded, also: the performance of Jenny Hasselqvist, thus described by French director Ren\u00e9 Clair: \u201cWe shall never forget her flaming eyes, the severity of her spirit, her abrupt and alarmed expressions, like an animal under threat.\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w2MEppuweUWaCVB2cuCvpgpgrbD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
