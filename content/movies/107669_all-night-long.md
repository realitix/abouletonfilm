She said that the woman on the screen wasn't her. But all films tell two stories: the plot and the tale of the bodies filmed. This film narrates what happened between two images: a first shot of 'Pandora' and a first shot of 'Harem', the first and last movie filmed by the actress in Spain. Ava must certainly have thought that neither of these two women had anything in common with herself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6uv6bYKxGx3bQ0ToQxFb38hsAkJ.jpg", "actors": ["Carlos Abella ()", "Jaime Arias ()", "Lucia Bos\u00e9 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "LKivdqZXYro"}
