The statue of Nero comes to life and tries to burn the nearby painting of Rome but his matches go out. He tries to get a set of \"hear no evil\" monkeys to take the matches from a still life, but they refuse and he teases them. The other artworks come to their defense. Nero plays hurt, and gets the monkeys to help; after they stumble around in the still life for a while, they get drunk on lighter fluid and start breathing flames, which they combine with the fluid to act as a flamethrower. Soon, the museum is ablaze and all the paintings are either sounding the alarm or coming to fight the fire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qXMNIq0k386AVPE5AB3YvVbsvjc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
