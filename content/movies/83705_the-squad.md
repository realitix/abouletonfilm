The mountain is shrouded in fog and the men are exhausted. They've been fighting guerrillas on enemy turf for some time, and they're worn down by the stress and anxiety of battle. The men don't want to wait; they want to charge up the hill, fearing that their comrades in the base have been overrun by the guerrillas. The squad's leader tries futilely to keep his men in line while dealing with his insolent second-in-command.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hulXitLsl3eCqbWdFDuQnuTcFtb.jpg", "actors": ["Juan David Restrepo (Ramos)", "Mateo Stevel (Parra)", "Mauricio Navas (Teniente)", "Andr\u00e9s Casta\u00f1eda (Sargento)", "Julio C\u00e9sar Valencia (Robledo)", "Juan Pablo Barragan (Ponce)", "Daniela Catz (Mujer)", "Andres Torres (Arango)", "Nelson Camayo (Fiquitiva)", "Alejandro Aguilar (Cortez)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [29926, 135589, 254010, 386621], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
