In 1938 Lenard, a writer with a Jewish background, fled the Nazis to a safe haven in Rome. Shortly thereafter, the U.S. Army Graves Registration Service hired Lenard to reconstruct the bones, small and large, of dead American soldiers. Eventually he found himself in remotest Brazil where he embarked on the translation of \u201cWinnie the Pooh\u201d into Latin, an eccentric task that catapulted him to brief world-wide fame. Sachs\u2019 essay film uses personal letters, abstracted war imagery, home movies, interviews and a children\u2019s performance to create an intimate meditation on the destructive power of war.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/90zow66ivgH9EzRTT3VD37vnDwn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
