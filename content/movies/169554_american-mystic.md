Set against depressed but quintessentially American landscapes - the former revivalist district of upstate New York, old mining country in the mountains of northern California, and the stark badlands of South Dakota - the film interlaces three very intimate, apolitical portraits of young individuals trying to lead more extraordinary, mystical lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w2lWBkmg21WXgYCe8SVHYdAmrfv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
