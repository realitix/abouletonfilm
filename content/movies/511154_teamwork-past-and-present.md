Stone engravings record a complete absence of cooperation between the Egyptian ruler and his slaves but, beginning with the Greeks and Romans, there was a gradual change towards recognition of the labourer. With the growth of factories, the trend received a setback, but reasserted itself through the expediencies of World War II, which saw the formation of the first Labour Management Production Committee (LMPC) in Britain. In post-war Canada the film shows LMPCs well implanted in industrial life, with the Industrial Production Cooperation Board giving official government recognition.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
