In the story, a boy, a woman and a cow seem to be the only survivors of a global catastrophe, except for whoever is following them threateningly in a tank. Slowly they put together what they need to survive, and despite the difficulty of all this, it looks as though the human race may just manage a new beginning. This simple, darkly imaged story is told with a very minimal amount of dialog. Sci-Fi and action fans may find the film disappointing, but conoisseurs of metaphor may find what they are looking for here.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Maria Ploae ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
