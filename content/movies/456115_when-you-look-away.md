Is it possible to exist across multiple worlds simultaneously? When her young daughter insists she\u2019s sometimes human and sometimes an animal, filmmaker Phie Ambo wonders what else might exist outside a singular human consciousness. Committing to the principal of randomness, she plumbs the minds of various leading thinkers, from the father of string theory to a Buddhist monk, from a clairvoyant to a janitor. Just as impressive as their fascinating ideas, however, is the visual correlative of this ever-deepening metaphysical query. Who would expect the mysteries of existence to lurk inside the grease trap at an amusement park or in a single cup of tap water? Prepare to have your reality permanently altered by this mind-boggling, impossible and thoroughly compelling film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/CaOv2FN6MQriLPVTnK16hcoynX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
