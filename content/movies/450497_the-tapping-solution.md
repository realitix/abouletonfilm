The Tapping Solution explores Tapping in a way that's never been seen before. The film combines the wisdom and experience of world famous teachers, speakers, and motivators, with an element that's usually missing: REAL LIFE CASES, unfolding before your eyes. Ten people spend four days working with Tapping practitioners to see if they can turn their lives around. The results are fully documented and the ride is one that you'll never forget.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oXOiqTIgQYYEyPeWvjWAzcIytog.jpg", "actors": ["Bruce H.
