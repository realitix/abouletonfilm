The conductor Conlon gave us a short but enlightening lecture an hour before the performance. My seat was a little too far and I missed parts of actions. Especially I could not read the expressions of singers. I am extremely happy that they produced a DVD that shows details of actions in fine blue ray resolution and superb audio quality. Verdi would have liked the performances by Domingo and Semenchuk and Conlon. Stages and costumes were designed meticulously with ample budget."}], "recommandations_id": []}
