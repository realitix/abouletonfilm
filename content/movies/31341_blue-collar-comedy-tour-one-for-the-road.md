Not as funny as the first, but still entertaining. You can see these guys genuinely like each other and basically try to make the other laugh. No swearing (so safe for the kiddies as well) and if you like crude jokes, this is one for you. You might be redneck if pickup this movie."}], "recommandations_id": [45062, 23626, 22427, 35143]}
