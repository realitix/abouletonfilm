Now, stocked with a cooler full of good ole boy jokes (and plenty of Pabst Blue Ribbon), the comics are hitting the road once again to unleash their unique brand of redneck humor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9999ij9VE3Bf7QBLxDRYsacnJYb.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Engvall (Bill Engvall)", "Ron White (Ron White)", "Jeff Foxworthy (Jeff Foxworthy)", "Larry the Cable Guy (Larry The Cable Guy)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "Killa-What?", "content": "The third in the series of on the road standup from comedians Jeff Foxworthy, Larry the Cable Guy, Bill Engvall and Ron White. Not as funny as the first, but still entertaining. You can see these guys genuinely like each other and basically try to make the other laugh. No swearing (so safe for the kiddies as well) and if you like crude jokes, this is one for you. You might be redneck if pickup this movie."}], "recommandations_id": [45062, 22427, 23626, 35143], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
