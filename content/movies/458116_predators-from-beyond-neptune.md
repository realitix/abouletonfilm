Hoping to move up in the world, Leslie and David decide to start pitching a glossier project around town, and they score a deal with a major studio to make a mid-budget science fiction-thriller. However, Leslie and David soon find themselves butting heads with the head of the studio, and when the financing is pulled from their project, they find themselves trying to finish it on a budget even they find impossible. Jason Priestley, Neve Campbell, and Dean Devlin all make cameo appearances as themselves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/545lWrmLelXWhCv8c7mhY7GG7s2.jpg", "actors": ["Neve Campbell (Herself)", "Tim Caldwell (Groppo, King of Pluto)", "Dean Devlin (Himself)", "Stephen Eckelberry (Bill Goodwyn)", "Tony Ferriter (Barton Bachs)", "Bob Gill (Crazy Toymaker)", "Robert Harvey (Lance Wright)", "Ashley Hill (Leslie Miller)", "Scott Mabbutt (Himself)", "Tracy Langan (Studio Lawyer)", "Shannon K.
