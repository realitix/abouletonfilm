His ocean-deep baritone voice is not dissimilar to that of the great Joe Williams, but he uses it sparingly, delivering just a few choruses before starting to dance in a manner that recalls Nelson Mandela's trademark two-step. He then eases his 67-year-old frame into a hearty slow-mo twist. This is possibly not what was expected of an artist commonly perceived as an avant-garde firestarter in the mould of Albert Ayler, and a committed disciple of the final phase of John Coltrane's career in the mid-60s.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
