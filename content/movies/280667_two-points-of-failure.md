The film as you see it was constituted by dissolving negative emulsion in a chemical solution while recording the sounds of its own making. Through an extended, repeated looking, it functions as both an index of a disappearance and the remainder of the objects, techniques and medium which is now lost.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8Xt8GaoI34jd4bVrQFxJ5gZPovq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
