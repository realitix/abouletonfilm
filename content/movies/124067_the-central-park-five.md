They spent between 6 and 13 years in prison before a serial rapist confessed that he alone had committed the crime, leading to their convictions being overturned. Set against a backdrop of a decaying city beset by violence and racial tension, this is the story of that horrific crime, the rush to judgment by the police, a media clamoring for sensational stories and an outraged public, and the five lives upended by this miscarriage of justice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8vxCgBGejodjZrC9noJM9KA8KUK.jpg", "actors": ["Antron McCray (Himself (voice))", "Kevin Richardson (Himself)", "Yusef Salaam (Himself)", "Raymond Santana (Himself)", "Kharey Wise (Himself)", "Matias Reyes (Himself (archive footage))", "Jim Dwyer (Himself - New York Times)", "Angela Black (Herself - Kevin's Sister)", "Ed Koch (Himself - Former Mayor, New York)", "Craig Steven Wilder (Himself - Historian)", "LynNell Hancock (Herself - Journalist)", "Calvin O.
