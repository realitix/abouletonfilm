Continuously fired from minimum wage employment, Blake and his best friend Elliot get sucked into the dangerous world of gambling. Luckily, Blake's sister Angela has proven to be a reliable roommate and so far taken care of her irresponsible younger brother. When a car crash on the way to a job interview lands her in the hospital, Blake offers to start the job in his sister's place, which turns out to be more complicated than expected: His ward is the homely and socially inept 20-year-old agoraphobic Giselle, who insists on a *female* assistant. However, the girl and her mother have never met Angela in person, and thus Blake is able to transform himself into a convincingly enough version of his sister.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qWn9wI0eBdLaxyWOiU2dA6WeQWq.jpg", "actors": ["Clark Koelsch (Blake)", "Jamie Hill (Giselle Summers)", "Justin Giddings (Elliot)", "Amy Lyndon (Susanna)", "Victoria Masina (Aurora Summers)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
