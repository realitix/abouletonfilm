Naoko chooses Haru to be the lead as she leverages her power as director to pursue the romantic connection that fuels her voracious creativity. However, as opening night approaches, jealous entanglements threaten the artistic and ideological aims of the project, as well as the relationship with Haru pulling Naoko from her womanizing ways. Based on her own semi-autobiographical novel Kokan, cult theater director and actress Junko Emoto makes her directorial debut in this playful drama relishing the toil and passion of a struggling creative life on and off stage. -JAPAN CUTS: Festival of New Japanese Film", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t4OwE3OcQkrRyXxfsJYZyIXeXPK.jpg", "actors": ["Saori (Naoko)", "Arisa Nakamura (Haru)", "Yuka Masuda ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
