Believing their politics and art to be absurdly different, De Antonio instead gamely proposed to drink an entire quart of J&amp;B scotch in 20 minutes under the unflinching, voyeuristic gaze of Warhol\u2019s camera. Their Factory session, recorded in this film, instead lasted 66 minutes, its grand finale a reckless and grandiose De Antonio writhing on the floor, clawing the walls, and speaking in tongues.\" - MoMA", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Emile de Antonio ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
