Based on Astrid Lindgren's book 'Emil of L\u00f6nneberga'. A story of a little boy, Emil, who, according to others is incredibly naughty, but actually Emil is a lot more kind hearted than all the rest. And everything he does is to help someone. But somehow it all the time turns out like a prank. His family won't agree with any pranks on themselves, so there goes Emil in his father's tool shed, where he's locked up for every prank. Includes the phrase - 'the main idea is to keep your feet warm', which has been adapted in Latvian culture, so it's already a saying.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jRT10gyxaWKmOUypLq8feJZ27fG.jpg", "actors": ["M\u0101ris Zonnenbergs-Zombergs (Em\u012bls)", "Madara Di\u0161lere (Ida)", "Dace Eversa (Mate)", "Uldis Dumpis (Tevs)", "Di\u0101na Zande (Lina)", "Rudolfs Plepis (Alfreds)", "Vija Artmane (Nabagmajas komendante)", "Dina Kuple (Kresas Maija)", "\u0112valds Valters (Joke)", "Olga Krumina (Petrela kundze)", "Harijs Liepi\u0146\u0161 (Emils Svensons)", "J\u0101nis Zari\u0146\u0161 ()", "Imants Adermanis ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
