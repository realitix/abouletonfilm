Secretly, Ma's foreman Stoner is plotting with real estate man Ed Dutton to ruin her ranch and acquire it cheaply, with controlling water rights. Johnny stops henchman Dade in an attempt to dynamite the barn and Stoner, supposedly taking him to the sheriff, kills him. Johnny stops Glenn and Beth from tearing down a Curtis fence in order to get their cattle to water, but Glenn refuses to help even after Johnny explains he is helping Ma in order to find out who is behind the attacks on both ranches. Ma pretends to fire Johnny for saving Glenn from an ambush. As the outlaws attempt to rustle Ma's remaining cattle, Johnny, Alibi and Glenn join forces.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i2anxtMPyzS4XGVJuLkDVzYR2XG.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Mack Brown (Johnny Mack Brown)", "Max Terhune (Alibi)", "Tris Coffin (Ed Dutton)", "Riley Hill (Glenn Hadley)", "Sarah Padden (Ma Curtis)", "Eddie Parker (Henchman Lacey)", "Fred Kohler Jr. (Henchman Stoner)", "Felice Ingersoll (Beth Hadley)", "Kenne Duncan (Henchman Kirk)", "Myron Healey (Murdered Henchman)", "Bill Hale (Henchman Bud)", "Bill Potter (Singing cowhand Bill (as Bill Porter))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
