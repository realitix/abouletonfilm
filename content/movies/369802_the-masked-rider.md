Violent bandit and cattle rustler Pancho, his rude henchman Santas and a group of raiders have sworn to drive the settlers out of the Border country. In the conflict that follows, Harry's father Bill is mortally wounded, and Pancho's hands are crushed, supposedly by the ranchers, though the act is actually committed by his traitorous and vengeful lieutenant Santas and his equally slimy compatriot Rodriguez, whom Pancho has offended by denying one his daughter's hand, and the other permission to pursue Rancher's daughter Ruth Chadwick. Pancho swears bitter revenge on the Burrels and the two factions resolve to destroy each other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nEL5yilC0BMc6LqD37OouCgwxQV.jpg", "actors": ["Harry Myers (Harry Burrel)", "Ruth Stonehouse (Ruth Chadwick)", "Paul Panzer (Pancho)", "Edna Holland (Juanita)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
