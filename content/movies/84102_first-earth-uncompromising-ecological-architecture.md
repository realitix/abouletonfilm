An audiovisual manifesto filmed over the course of 4 years and 4 continents, FIRST EARTH makes the case that earthen homes are the healthiest housing in the world; and that since it still takes a village to raise a healthy child, it is incumbent upon us to transform our suburban sprawl into eco-villages, a new North American dream.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6ezpAtCQqc5Ou2aN3SkxDbkcTqn.jpg", "actors": ["Becky Bee (Herself)", "Katy Bryce (Herself)", "Meka Bunch (Herself)", "James Chaffers (Himself)", "Elke Cole (Herself)", "Stuart Cowan (Himself)", "Salma Samar Damluji (Herself)", "Ianto Evans ()", "Chellis Glendinning ()", "Richard Heinberg ()", "Alfie Howard ()", "Katie Jeane ()", "Derrick Jenssen ()", "Janell Kapoor ()", "Sun Ray Kelly ()", "Joseph Kennedy ()", "James Howards Kunstler ()", "Mark Lakeman ()", "Ian Marcuse ()", "Kevin McCabe ()", "Bridget Miner ()", "Muhammed Ya Moussa ()", "Sunflower New Moon ()", "Tim Ream ()", "Boots Riley ()", "John Robertson ()", "David Room ()", "Michael G.
