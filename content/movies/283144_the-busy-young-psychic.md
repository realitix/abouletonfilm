Much better than it's derivative work \"The Teenage Psychic\". If you want to taste the authentic Taiwan culture, I recommend it with all my heart, instead of the shame produced by HBO, which is a mix of common elements in the whole world only with the intention to attract who know who, perfectly made that mini series a less-than-so-so."}], "recommandations_id": []}
