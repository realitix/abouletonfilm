Since the summer, thousands of young Russians, driven by television propaganda and a thirst for adventure, began to pour in. Among these volunteers were Oleg and Max. Oleg became a battalion commander and Max remained an ordinary soldier. While they prepare to fight, they discuss their motivations and share their own perspective on the conflict. The image becomes a unique personal testimony of one side of the war, one rarely seen in the western media.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/612rMNgjbAUZ7uXhxF92IbsHESe.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
