One day she auditions for an oriental dance competition (think the type of Jennifer Beals audition from Flash Dance) and is stopped by the judges because of her lifeless performance. They are captured by her obvious beauty but do not buy her lifeless rendition of Arabian poetry. It is her obstinate rebellious nature that drives them to select them, when she challenges the jury to show her how she is supposed to display love when society forbids her to do so. She catches the eye of Beshir (Mohammed Mounir) who takes her under his wing, hoping to rescue her from a dark secret from the past as well as make her his muse.\r\n\r\nThe forbidden attraction between them in unmistakable and only deepens as Dunia awakens to the sensuality hidden beneath her traditional values. Turk, a trained dancer in real life is flawless in the dance sequences and she has a body to die for. Her costumes are great as well. By the way, all the magnificent songs in the film are performed by none other than \"The voice of Egypt\" Mohammed Mounir. Dunia is a force to reckon with as she raises awareness to the trials and tribulations associated with being a woman in Egypt. Walid Aouni plays Dunia's dance teacher, Khaled El Sawi & Youssef Ismail co -star. Controversial but also a must see!"}], "recommandations_id": []}
