The film portrays his thoughts, his dreams, and his beliefs, and allows for an intimate immersion into his life. Paulusie is a caring son to his ailing father and a good boyfriend. But what begins as the story of an innocent teenager quickly becomes the struggle of a young man coping with the guilt of having made a huge mistake. Tragically, Paulusie takes the most dramatic decision and takes his own life. Living with Giants remains a poetic journey of resilience that echoes issues that are far greater than Paulusie's personal story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aMfYg4w95fYBdSbKgwsA2zkxZfD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
