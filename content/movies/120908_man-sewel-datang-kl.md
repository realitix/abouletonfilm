In Kuala Lumpur, Man stays with his village friend, Salim, who teaches him a lot about city life. It is through Salim that Man meets Nadia, an ex model. However, Man fails to see that Nadia is only looking for a boy toy to buy her expensive gifts. Eventually Man's assets run dry and he is forced to work odd jobs in order to fund his living. Will Man ever be able to pick himself up and adapt to the harsh city life or will he fall victim like so many people before him, who fail to see beyond the superficial?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zqNJGFS57F2AJfQyHcFiz8NAglt.jpg", "actors": ["Shuib Sepah (Man)", "Zally Hussain (Salim)", "Julia Ziegler (Nadia)", "Rosnah Mat Aris (Maimon)", "Zaibo (Pak Din)", "Rafidah Ibrahim (Siti Khadijah)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
