In HACKS, the Austrian multimedia artist Christine Bader examines who is the computer hacker and what moves him or her. Is the hacker a Robin Hood in cyber space or an anarchistic agitator? Bader speaks with Dutch, German and American communication freaks who are working with various kinds of network issues, like making the Internet accessible to individual persons (Felipe Rodriguez, founder of Internet provider Xs4all), creating a meeting place in cyber space, or designing an ultramodern communication network on a \u2018multimedia art ship\u2018. \u2018Hackers are not encumbered by technical, financial or organizational problems, they just want to do things\u2018, Rodriguez thinks. That the technological means \u2018just to do things\u2018 are now freely available is demonstrated by the numerous computer initiatives that whiz past in HACKS.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fTuIz1JFAGuUXp8kNMu6lZFeSad.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
