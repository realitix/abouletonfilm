The film traces the ups and downs of three Neapolitan street musicians. Vittorio de Sica plays Nunzio, a blind violinist, while Enrico Glori portrays Paolo, a deaf clarinetist. Both are enamored of singer Paolina (Fiorella Berti), the illegitimate daughter of a wealthy nobleman (Sandro Ruffini). Neither Nunzio nor Paolo are aware of the girl's lineage; when Nunzio finds out, he tries all too late to arrange a reunion between father and daughter. Meanwhile, Paolina finds happiness in the arms of a humble sailor. Though it probably wasn't intentional, Sperduti nel Buio has much in common with the 1938 English comedy-drama Sidewalks of London.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f1gsTVMSNuC6hjHAnkA0VyqBRJT.jpg", "actors": ["Vittorio De Sica ()", "Fiorella Betti ()", "Jacqueline Plessis ()", "Enrico Glori ()", "Olga Solbelli ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
