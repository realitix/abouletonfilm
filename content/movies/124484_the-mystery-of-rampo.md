However, after burning his drafts, his publisher shows him a newspaper with an account of events just like his forbidden story. As the film progresses, fantasy and reality intermingle in a tale that draws heavily on influences from Poe and Stoker's Dracula. The film's strongly Expressionistic direction skillfully combines a variety of media (animation, computer-generated imagery, grainy black-and-white fast film stock, color negatives) for artistic effect.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wJwpYxyUwV2EuysXQRZlgUCVanB.jpg", "actors": ["Masahiro Motoki (Kogoro Akechi)", "Naoto Takenaka (Edogawa Rampo)", "Michiko Hada (Shizuko)", "Teruyuki Kagawa (Masashi Yokomizo)", "Mikijiro Hira ()", "Shir\u00f4 Sano ()", "Ittoku Kishibe ()", "Nekohachi Edoya ()", "Junichi Takagi ()", "Kirin Kiki ()", "Julie Dreyfus ()", "Yoshio Harada ()", "Kinji Fukasaku ()", "Hiroshi Abe ()", "Genjiro Arato ()", "Tetsuya Bessho ()", "Yu Hayami ()", "Kazuya Kimura ()", "Tomokazu Miura ()", "Kenji Otsuki ()", "K\u014dji Wakamatsu ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "0So1yPDSUjA"}
