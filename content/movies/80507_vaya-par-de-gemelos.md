Luke is married to the owner of a modest supermarket and works as dependent, porter and whatever is needed ... Moreover, unlike his brother, he has never left the village. Instead, Pedro is married to the richest chocolate maker in the place, lives like a king and often travels to Madrid. But to justify his travels he has invented an illegitimate son who lives there studying architecture and that his wife wants to protect, giving him all the money he needs. The plan goes perfect until love complicates things.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jHcEAFDDRkJiYdbZ80GMTYIyc7t.jpg", "actors": ["Paco Mart\u00ednez Soria (Lucas / Pedro / T\u00edo Lucas)", "Margot Cottens (Julia)", "Mar\u00eda Isbert (Mariana)", "Inma de Santis (Pilar)", "Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Guill\u00e9n (Jorge)", "In\u00e9s Morales (Rosi)", "Pedro Hurtado (Melchor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [81174, 86044, 55550, 86037], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
