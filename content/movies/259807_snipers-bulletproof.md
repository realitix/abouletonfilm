The people who planned the takedowns, or pulled the trigger, share their techniques and bring to light the many factors that had to be considered in each mission: terrain, wind speed, temperature, elevation changes... all are critical to taking out targets considered bulletproof. A sniper has one chance, one breath, to rise to the occasion and save the day... if they miss, there may never be another opportunity. As these never told before stories unfold, the viewer also learns about the high tech gear each sniper carries on their classified missions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iTIkFfOVAVLDfB50Kh70Q5n1TA5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
