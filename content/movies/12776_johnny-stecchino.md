So he is very excited when after nearly being knocked down by her car he meets Maria, who seems immediately enamoured of him. He is soon invited to her sumptuous Palermo villa, little suspecting that this is part of a plot. He bears an amazing likeness to Maria's stool-pigeon gangster husband and it would be convenient for them if the mobster, in the shape of Dante, was seen to be dead and buried.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/im7KfvlvYf8Grlemc9lOMqgt4cG.jpg", "actors": ["Roberto Benigni (Johnny Stecchino)", "Nicoletta Braschi (Maria)", "Paolo Bonacelli (D'Agata)", "Franco Volpi (Ministro)", "Ivano Marescotti (Dr. Randazzo)", "Turi Scalia (Giudice)", "Loredana Romito (Gianna)", "Alessandro De Santis (Lillo)", "Salvatore Borgese (Ignazio)", "Gaetano Campisi (Picciotto in auto)", "Giulio Donnini (Cardinale)", "Domenico Minutoli (Questore di Palermo)", "Georgia O'Brien (Moglie del ministro)", "Ignazio Pappalardo (Cozzamara)", "Gigliola Reina ()", "Tony Sperandeo (Picciotto in auto)", "Giorgio Trestini (Portiere Hotel)", "Vito Zappal\u00e0 (Maresciallo)", "Amedeo Carlo Mangiu (Barbiere)", "Luciana Pieri Palombi ()", "Conchita Puglisi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [22826, 43645, 27670, 10599], "youtube_key": "x-J6XyNHM3I"}
