Since the Twilight movies weren't filmed in the real Volterra, this is your opportunity to see the town that Stephenie Meyer handpicked as the setting for the vampire dynasty in her epic saga. Are there truly vampires there? Hear from the real people living their lives in the town describe the medieval history and dark past that eerily match events from the books and movies. Drive into town just as Bella and Alice did on their frantic journey to save Edward, see the Volturi palace, and escape their clutches as you exit through the giant stone gate in the ancient city wall. Filmed in full HD by award-winning Director Jason Brown, this movie is a must-have for Twilight fans who want to know the true story of Volterra, and the untold tales of its unique history, mysticism and culture.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
