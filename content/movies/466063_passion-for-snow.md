Everett Koop, Robert Frost and 100+ Winter Olympians have in common? They all spent time at Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH where winters are long and snowy.  Passion for Snow traces over 100 years of ski history in the United States with a focus on the many contributions of Dartmouth College and its alumni to the formation, growth and ongoing innovations in all aspects of snowsports. Passion for Snow combines firsthand accounts from early ski pioneers, veterans of the 10th Mountain Division, Olympians, members of the U.S. Ski Hall of Fame and top ski industry and resort executives, who explain how the most remotely located college in the Ivy League helped spawn a $25 billion industry, and continues to shape it today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/36NanUrrAsUyZNxWBAn0QLALb1z.jpg", "actors": ["Buck Henry (Narrator)", "Tryg Myhren (Himself)", "John Morten (Himself)", "Tom Corcoran (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "BXOoxFYmrUM"}
