{"tmdb_id": 3966, "title": "Blondie Knows Best", "original_title": "Blondie Knows Best", "slug_title": "blondie-knows-best", "date": "1946-10-17", "genre": ["Com\u00e9die"], "score": "6.0/10", "synopsis": "Dagwood Bumstead (Arthur Lake) poses as his boss Mr. Dithers (Jonathan Hale) so that a big business deal can be consummated while Dithers avoids nearsighted process server Jim Gray (Shemp Howard). The upshot of all this is that Dagwood ends up in a lunatic asylum, forcing Blondie (Penny Singleton) to come to the rescue. Number 18 in the long running Blondie series.  Blondie Knows Best was writer/director Edward Bernds' first entry in the long-running \"Blondie\" series, and arguably his funniest.  Bernds was a big fan of comedian Shemp Howard (whom he'd directed in several Columbia 2-reelers) and accordingly he gives Shemp free reign in his scenes, resulting in some hystericially funny moments.  Blondie Knows Best represented Jonathan Hale's farewell to the series; in the next entry, Blondie's Big Moment, he would be replaced by Jerome Cowan as Mr. Radcliffe", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/omR9Zx3VWdFPZ1zM0M4xYd6Pzto.jpg", "actors": ["Penny Singleton (Blondie Bumstead)", "Arthur Lake (Dagwood \" Dag \" Bumstead)", "Larry Simms (Alexander Bumstead)", "Marjorie Ann Mutchie (Cookie Bumstead)", "Daisy (Daisy)", "Jonathan Hale (J.C.
