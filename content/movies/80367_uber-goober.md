Director Steve Metze examines several different groups including historical miniature gamers, role-players, and those known simply as \"LARPers.\" The film also explores opposition from religious groups, negative media portrayals, and some of the meanest 'man-on-the-street' interviews ever committed to video. Meet the Gamers, learn their exotic language, see their bizarre rituals, gasp at their semi-authentic costumes, and thrill to the painting techniques on their miniatures!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/udpsnfWKLbUytI9sUDAarWVbKOP.jpg", "actors": ["Gary Gygax (Himself)", "Luke Sienkowski (Himself)", "Rob Smith (Himself)", "Becca Smith (Herself)", "Phil Viverito (Himself)", "John Kovalic (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
