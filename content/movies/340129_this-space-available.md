Can we reverse this visual pollution? This Space Available looks at diverse activists from the worlds of advertising, street art, and politics. Influenced by the writing of Marc Gob\u00e9 ( Emotional Branding ), his daughter Gwena\u00eblle directs with tremendous verve in her depiction of New Yorkers and others around the world who want to reclaim the integrity of their cities against an onslaught of visual pollution.  From 240 hours of film, 160 interviews, and visits to 11 countries on five continents, This Space Available charts a fascinating variety of struggles against unchecked advertising and suggests that more than aesthetics is at stake. If Jacques Attali once called noise pollution an act of violence, is visual pollution also such an act?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1TpGXwtv5vJMtgQOozftK38wcsJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
