Adhering to a solitary intimacy while simultaneously acting as an ode to human endeavour and shared impulses toward fulfillment through art, Listening to the Space in my Room is a moving testament to existence (whose traces are found in literature, music, filmmaking, gardening) and our endless search for meaning and authenticity. The film's precise yet enigmatic sound-image construction carries a rare emotional weight.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8iHnwjBp2towaKR80aj7BnXz5CO.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Beavers (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
