Despite their social limitations, both dream of getting married, but straight identifying John refuses to tie the knot until transsexual Martine gets a real vagina. The only problem: no doctor in Canada will perform operation because Martine's obesity makes her too great of a surgical risk. Will Martine and John find the happiness together that they deserve? Transfixed is a deeply human story about love, freedom, and self-actualization.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bnZkSlEGa7RsQGZfmrj4wn8n3GK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
