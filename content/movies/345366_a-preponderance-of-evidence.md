These are shocking testimonies about the burden of female identity: illegal abortions performed in the '50s without anesthesia; the dynamics of the relationship between husbands and wives; the inability to participate in the enjoyment of sex. A mixture of documentary and narrative filmmaking, Davis' powerful film is a personal female journey to deconstruct the burden of inherited identity. - Stela Jelincic", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2xwXQWKzBlpcvvh3hh43gzueX0q.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
