She is trying to change her ways and to make a living, but it turns out to be an impossible achievement for her. Not having any other means to survive, she turns to stealing, but is quickly apprehended and severely sentenced. She tries to cover her tracks and takes on the identity of Marija, a successful scientist who is preparing her PhD in psychoanalysis. The real Marija learns about this identity theft, which awakens an interest in Slavica's way of life.
