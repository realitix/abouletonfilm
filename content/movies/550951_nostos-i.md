There is hardly any representation in Nostos I: just enough to tip-toe around the edges of analogy, illusion, under the image and in between images.\" Unfolding as memory traces and dream images, figures and objects appear and disappear, decompose and recompose; disjointed fragments evolve in continuous transformation and manipulations of light and time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9ok86xWhnafF6cC9ANL8agOfkaN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
