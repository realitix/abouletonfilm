The filmmaker creates a real-life political suspense story, one remarkable detail at a time, built from archival footage; interviews with surviving members of the Nixon White House (including Pat Buchanan and John Dean), reporters (Lesley Stahl, Dan Rather and, of course, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein), special prosecutors (Richard Ben-Veniste, Jill Wine-Banks); the Senate Watergate Committee (Lowell Weicker), members of the House Judiciary Committee who debated Nixon\u2019s impeachment (Elizabeth Holtzman), modern commentators, and historians; and carefully executed recreations based on the Oval Office recordings. Ferguson also accomplishes the difficult and immediately relevant task of drawing extremely disquieting fact-based parallels with another presidency and criminal investigation, still underway.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oTtBCQYJrqmMjAnWo61JDkEvFQw.jpg", "actors": ["Charles Ferguson (Narrator (voice))", "Douglas Hodge (Richard Nixon)", "Elliot Levey (Henry Kissinger)", "Will Keen (John Ehrlichman)", "John Hopkins (H.R.
