But that\u2019s not an easy task with the Demon Wardens scouring the land and taking care of demons who have taken on human form. Five years ago Izumo Wakuraba (Somegoro Ichikawa) served as a Demon Warden lieutenant alongside his chief, Kuninari and the slightly mental Jaku Abe. Since then he\u2019s retired and has been enjoying success as a lead actor for the Nakamura Kabuki troupe, led by playwright Nanboku Tsuruya IV, while his former colleagues continue to fight the good fight.
