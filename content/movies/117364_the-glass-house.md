Finding Home follows four girls striving to pull themselves out of the margins by attending a one-of-kind rehabilitation center in uptown Tehran. Forget about the Iran that you've seen before. With a virtually invisible camera, the girls of Finding Home take us on a never-before-seen tour of the underclass of Iran with their brave and defiant stories: Samira struggles to overcome forced drug addiction; Mitra harnesses abandonment into her creative writing; Sussan teeters on a dangerous ledge after years of sexual abuse; and Nazila burgeons out of her hatred with her blazing rap music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cNlRdSabkJDvfnrochUZHb7R5AZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
