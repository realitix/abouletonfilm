This was my 4th film, shot while waiting to go to prison for refusing to serve in the US military. Silent. B&W. I think it captures the sense of depression, of loneliness within the city. Looking back it seems almost archaic, Chicago as some kind of East Bloc country in Soviet times.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vNqomqyMnhEN7e1wgwBn0ZU8TlZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
