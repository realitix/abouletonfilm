The wandering  ronin is reminiscent of his most famous role as the samurai without a name in  Kurosawa's \"Yojimbo\" and \"Sanjuro\". He travels about Japan, and while he may seek  happiness, violence and tragedy always cross his path. This time it is a woman  carrying a young infant who he encounters on the road that leads him into a tale of  violence, intrigue and a village in uproar. A great story and cool action scenes, a movie  not to be missed!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sdAUIR3gNZERo07KslDKHYIEyOc.jpg", "actors": ["Toshir\u014d Mifune (Sanjuro Hinoki)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
