Despite speculation, Holopainen said in a Finnish interview that the female doubles in this video have nothing to do with the removal of Tarja Turunen from Nightwish, saying \"It's just pure self-irony and rock 'n' roll\". The four models are referring to the rumor going around the fans that Anette Olzon, the new singer, was chosen to attract more fans because of her looks. In the video, they make fun of the rumor. The video was released on September 27, 2007.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pIn9RyVaJxnsvUxa6Vh6UPZg0zz.jpg", "actors": ["Tuomas Lauri Johannes Holopainen ()", "Marco Hietala ()", "Jukka Nevalainen ()", "Emppu Vuorinen ()", "Anette Olzon ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
