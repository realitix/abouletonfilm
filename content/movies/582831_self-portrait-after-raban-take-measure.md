The main difference is that Raban\u2019s work was made when cinematic media had distinct physical properties linking medium directly to image - this self portrait recognizes that there is no such simple materiality for cinema following the emergence of digital processes. Instead the work takes a conceptual base \u2013 the speed of light and the time taken for light to travel from the sun to illuminate objects on earth \u2013thus the duration of 8 minutes 20 seconds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w3iEQn2eirlEQQkoC9dRnqdvMIG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
