Physics papa physique chudu, social papa sokulu chudu, botany papa bottom chudu, zoology papa anatomy chudu, geography papa jathakamantha ethuthala kolathalu chudu...papa means girl, chudu translates to see. Do you see how it all rhymes, physics and physique, bottom and botany, zoology and anatomy? And ethuthalala is snide reference for female breasts. Even if you don't know what it means when you will see Thagubothu Ramesh (on whom the song is picturised) staring at the chest area of the ladies, you will get the point.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8NfghsimYmMI92xgDQOE0ZB15Zf.jpg", "actors": ["Vennela Kishore (Govindaraju)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
