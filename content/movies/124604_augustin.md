He's serious about his part-time job as a clerk for an insurance company, and he also acts, with small parts under his belt in commercials and experimental films. An agent finds his serious innocence perfect for a part as an odd bellman. Before his screen test, he volunteers for a day at a hotel. At his screen test, his inability to see the comic center of the scene makes him perfect for the part. Back at work, women co-workers tease him, and then he's off to the countryside to play a vet in a government film about myxomatosis in rabbits. Can anything break through his serious view of reality?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p72DonhxhaaR0MtcTowKjgZEjLO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
