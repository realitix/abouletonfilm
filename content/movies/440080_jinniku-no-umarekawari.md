Inspired by a nightmare involving a breathing washbasin and slithering meat. The film challenges expectations and perceptions by violently splicing together the worlds of live flesh and CG effects against a score of explosive white noise.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
