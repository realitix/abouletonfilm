In preparation of a debauchery evening, they get wasted, smoke some joints and talk about sex. Their conversation drifting, they sink into a night of errancy and disinhibition under the music of neons, motors and distant barking. A sensible and sincere look on a confused and reflective adolescence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jDd7bgLEAdjmSrRRF0nLwHj4jG9.jpg", "actors": ["Rapha\u00ebl Lacaille ()", "Conrad McDougall ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
