The girl suddenly returned his feelings. One night she confessed to him crying: she hit someone. The case was assigned to Csan\u00e1di, who wanted to investigate the circumstances meticulously despite his feelings. Thus the so far hidden life of Judit, which is bound to the past former world and its values is now highlighted. He is confused, asks his boss to absolve him from the assignment, but refuses to do so. Csan\u00e1di realises in the court room: Judit kept on telling lies, she played the lover for her own interest. The judge passed his crisis, he will deliver a fair sentence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tvpRGoPXtBvI57uhhQleVOmt0ji.jpg", "actors": ["Darvas Iv\u00e1n ()", "Violetta Ferrari ()", "Imre Ap\u00e1thi ()", "Ir\u00e9n S\u00fct\u0151 ()", "Rudolf Somogyv\u00e1ri ()", "J\u00f3zsef Tim\u00e1r ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
