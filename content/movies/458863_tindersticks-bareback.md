Working and growing together since 1993, their collaborations have produced unobtrusive yet elegant images that complement songs from across the band's discography. The DVD is a trim package with only nine videos in roughly 40 minutes, yet it excels as a document of thoughtful visual poetry, an evolving symbiotic relationship, and a convenient condensation of the group's achievements over the past decade [upon release]. In other words, Bareback can be appreciated for its visual and aural qualities, both independent of and in combination with each other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5QRrqk3pSGTBfARnL7ETr6WcGOH.jpg", "actors": ["Dave Boulter ()", "Mark Colwill ()", "Neil Frazer ()", "Tindersticks ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
