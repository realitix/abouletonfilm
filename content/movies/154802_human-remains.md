The film unveils the personal lives of Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Joseph Stalin, Francisco Franco and Mao Tse Tung. We learn the private and mundane details of their everyday lives -- their favorite foods, films, habits and sexual preferences. There is no mention of their public lives or of their place in history. The intentional omission of the horrors for which these men were responsible hovers over the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/30ci01fLqUAmurzAYl57CUUi9CF.jpg", "actors": ["Eva Braun (Herself (archive footage))", "Francisco Franco (Himself (archive footage))", "Adolf Hitler (Himself (archive footage))", "V.I.
