To this end, the mayor outlaws play (which is a bit hard on the children) and refuses to help a rival town when it's flooded. But rats (seen only as shadows), fleeing the flood, invade Hamelin in droves; a magical piper, whose music only children (and rats) can hear, strikes a bargain...which, once the rats are gone, the Mayor and council renege on, to their subsequent regret.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eF4YAZ1MryDScWbimeyFJLPDHUq.jpg", "actors": ["Van Johnson (Pied Piper / Truson)", "Claude Rains (Mayor of Hamelin)", "Lori Nelson (Mara)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
