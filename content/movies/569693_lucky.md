Gowri gives Lucky the cold shoulder, and helping her keep Lucky at an arm's length is her dog Joo Joo. Gowri is compelled to resign from her job and takes over as creative head of an advertising company. Lucky comes for a job interview and figuring that Gowri would probably not let him get a job in her work place, he takes on a different identity, Vicky, complete with new wardrobe and changed hairstyle. As Vicky builds a rapport with Gowri, he comes to know that she's pining for Lucky."}], "recommandations_id": []}
