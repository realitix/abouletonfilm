There he meets Lynn O'Malley, the niece of Sandy McTavish who runs the trading post. Lee learns the reason why this is good trapping country is because the timber barons across the lake are ruthlessly cutting the trees and driving the animals across the river. The trappers appeal to him to take a petition to the Governor which would prohibit the timber people from coming to their side of the lake. At first, because he is a wanted man, he refuses but does so later for the sake of the people even though he knows it will lead to his arrest.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7G2KCq0W4sGu5QYKuev08lkD2Iz.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Lowery (Lee Preston / Leland Bruce)", "Helen Gilbert (Lynn O'Malley / McTavish)", "William Farnum (Sandy McTavish)", "Buster Keaton (Old Tarp / Mr. Boone)", "Si Jenks (Timber Cross)", "Stanley Andrews (Howard King)", "Al Ferguson ('Turk' Monroe)", "Trevor Bardette (White Cloud)", "Estelita Zarco (River Squaw (as Estelle Zarco))", "Ace the Wonder Dog (Ace)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
