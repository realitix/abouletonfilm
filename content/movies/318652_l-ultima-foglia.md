It doesn't help that he works as a nightwatchman, and that she has left a satisfying job teaching music to children to follow him, and is now out of work. During his endless nocturnal rounds with his lively colleague, Tom, Zeno meet a pretty Romanian waitress, Ela, and begins a flirtation that eventually leads to a passionate kiss. As expected, Zeno and Rossana's relationship deteriorates even further, and not even the news that Rossana is expecting their child can help them reconnect.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
