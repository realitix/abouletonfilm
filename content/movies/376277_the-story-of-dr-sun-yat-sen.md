Concentrating on the period following his rise to political prominence in 1894 until his death in 1925, the movie is couched in terms of heroes who look heroic and villains who look villainous. Huge numbers of extras and vast battle scenes dot this production, and well-known Hong Kong and Taiwan-based movie stars appear in many cameos.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nl3pwOzckmPPJblPWmHGNVYvrEb.jpg", "actors": ["Lin Wei-Sheng (Dr. Sun Yat Sen)", "Alex Man Chi-Leung ()", "Pauline Wong Siu-Fung ()", "Derek Yee Tung-Sing ()", "Eddie Chen ()", "Moon Lee ()", "Kara Hui ()", "Gordon Liu Chia-Hui ()", "Chin Siu Ho ()", "Deannie Yip ()", "Don Wong Tao ()", "Ku Feng ()", "Ray Lui ()", "Poon Chi-Man ()", "Leung Kar-Yan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
