When Solmaz's daughter Zeynep decides to marry her lover from Adana, the ever-fearful Fikret ends up having to play the role of his life. Intended at first to be kept in the family, the wedding becomes a much bigger event upon the insistence of the groom's relatives. Can our heroes come to terms with the traditional Adana family who carry guns and own a kebab restaurant chain, and see the wedding through without mishaps?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lxA6UjZqRX1LFCQ6kgjpbCCP3JI.jpg", "actors": ["Engin G\u00fcnayd\u0131n (Fikret (Fiko))", "Demet Evgar (Solmaz)", "Erdal \u00d6zya\u011fc\u0131lar (Ha\u015fmet Kurt)", "Devrim Yakut (M\u00fckerrem Kurt)", "Fatih Artman (Emirhan Kurt)", "\u015eevket \u00c7oruh (Necdet (Neco))", "G\u00fclse Birsel (Mihriban)", "Derya Karada\u015f (Leyla)", "Su Kutlu (Zeynep)", "Ayta S\u00f6zeri (Behiye Hala)", "Deniz Hamzao\u011flu (Kahraman Kurt)", "Devin \u00d6zg\u00fcr \u00c7\u0131nar (G\u00fcl\u00fcmser Kurt)", "R\u0131za Ak\u0131n (Selahattin Alada\u011f)", "Arif Erkin G\u00fczelbeyo\u011flu (Dede)", "\u00dcnal Yeter (Okan)", "Erdal Cindoruk (Ma\u011faza sahibi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [450720, 499461, 577990, 477274], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
