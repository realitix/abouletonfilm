The show was filmed as part of Kevin\u2019s UK and Ireland tour and his 19 night residency at the Glasgow Hydro. It\u2019s written and performed by a comedian at the top of his game with Kevin giving his take on the modern world, social media, anxiety, religion, conversations with his dog and having Barack Obama as his support act. This is by far Kevin\u2019s best show to date and really is a stand up masterclass.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dcV0QEXsjjj45JorAUMyt5EdwOg.jpg", "actors": ["Kevin Bridges (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [534011, 559145, 368386, 498957], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
