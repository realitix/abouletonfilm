An extra night will be charged for all late departures.\" Jean-Claude Rousseau has used this banal, well-known notice as a synopsis for his film. Taken out of context, thereby rendering it mysterious, it is an ideal introduction to this letter, which consists of two shots \u2013 the front and behind of a window in a hotel in Turin \u2013 and an insert. Here, Rousseau continues to explore \"basic film techniques\" but in this case, he abandons super eight to film in DV, a new technique and a new quest for harmony between visuals and sounds.
