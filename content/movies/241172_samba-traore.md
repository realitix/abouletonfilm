Despite his protests that this is money that he earned in the city, the villagers have their doubts. In fact, he held up a gas station and unintentionally killed its attendant, and is in hiding here. Meanwhile, he has married a woman (Mariam Kaba) with a child who left her husband and built a house for her. He is building a bar with his remaining money, but he encounters a situation which makes him believe that he will be exposed to the police, and runs away, leaving a pregnant, very ill wife behind, much to the disgust of the villagers and Samba's own family.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kIGghdCY4URmArClCKliMyX5JV6.jpg", "actors": ["Bakary Sangar\u00e9 (Samba Traor\u00e9)", "Mariam Kaba (Saratou)", "Abdoulaye Komboudri (Salif)", "Ir\u00e8ne Tassemb\u00e9do (Binta)", "Moumouni Campaor\u00e9 (Af)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
