Brisson does the \"Prisoner of Zenda\" bit as a movie star who is forced by circumstances to impersonate a look-alike king. Ms. Ellis is the highborn lady who seems to be fooled by the ruse. The plots roll merrily onward while various and sundry musical-comedy character actors (including Edward Everett Horton and Eugene Pallette) fuss and fume in the background. Danish singer Carl Brisson had created a minor sensation by introducing \"Cocktails for Two\" in Paramount's Murder at the Vanities (34), but the studio's attempts to turn him into a Scandinavian Maurice Chevalier were unsuccessful.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jOXbJciXBq2Qc0t846fTHP8TOJN.jpg", "actors": ["Carl Brisson (King Rudolf XIV / Carlo Rocco)", "Edward Everett Horton (Count Josef 'Peppi' von Schlapstaat)", "Katherine DeMille (Fra\u00fclein Mimi)", "Eugene Pallette (Conrad Q.
