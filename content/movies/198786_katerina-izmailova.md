Galina Vishnevskaya stars as Katerina, a bored 19th century farm wife. At the behest of her grungy lover, Katerina murders her husband and her father-in-law. She and her new beau are both sent to Siberia, where the lover almost immediately takes up with a younger woman. Banned by Stalin for its bleak portrait of Soviet life, Katerina Izmailova was not given a Russian staging for over 40 years; its Metropolitan Opera debut did not occur until 1994. Dmitri Shostakovich also wrote the screenplay for the screen version of Katerina Izmailova.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/At9YBmcPYZuXT9Wn4ptcWxv6mtt.jpg", "actors": ["Galina Vishnevskaya (Katerina)", "Artyom Inozemtsev (Sergey)", "Nikolai Boyarsky ()", "Aleksandr Sokolov ()", "Tatyana Gavrilova ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
