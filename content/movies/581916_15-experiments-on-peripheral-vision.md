In reality, only a small central portion of human vision is sharp like a photograph. Peripheral vision is blurry and indistinct, the realm of intuition. In a series of short, playful experiments, this film explores what can be seen from the corner of the eye, perversely pushing at the central rectangle of the film frame to see how far it can stretch to suggest what lies beyond it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d1gjTtZ129G7SeRBYER8J4lo7ht.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
