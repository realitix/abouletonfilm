Fox as a teen in Beacontown, Nebraska, who works at his Dad\u2019s shop in town (James Hampton), plays basketball for his lousy school team and enjoys a friendship with a neighborhood girl (Susan Ursitti) while desiring the popular blonde (Lorie Griffin). Complications result when he starts turning into a werewolf.   \r\n\r\nThis was actually Fox\u2019s first theatrical film, made BEFORE the mega-successful \u201cBack to the Future\u201d but released afterward. By comparison it\u2019s a decidedly small movie, but enjoyable for what it is (an 80\u2019s teen flick). The second act takes a turn that I wasn\u2019t expecting. No spoilers, but the movie poster tells all. \r\n\r\nI liked the closing moral: Don\u2019t lose yourself in your special talent to the point that you lose your family/friends. If people just love you for your extraordinary gift are they truly your friends? A good real-life example is Bobby Knieval who became world famous as \u2018Evel\u2019 Knieval, the radical motorcycle daredevil: Family members said they \u201clost Bobby to Evel\u201d and the negative repercussions of fame (e.g. booze, babes, bucks and pomposity). Thankfully, in his later years he realized this and tried to make amends.\r\n\r\nGriffin has one notable scene as the \u201chottie\u201d without falling into tasteless sleaze.      \r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 31 minutes and was shot entirely in Southern California: South Pasadena (neighborhood & town), Los Angeles (school), Montrose (bowling alley) & Tujunga (liquor store). The credits acknowledge \u201cFriends in Fremont, Nebraska\u201d because the director traveled there and spent 3 hours talking to seniors for research. WRITERS: Jeph Loeb and Matthew Weisman. ADDITIONAL CAST: Matt Adler plays the protagonist\u2019s bud and Mark Arnold his rival. Jay Tarses plays the coach while James MacKrell appears as Mr. Thorne.            \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"}], "recommandations_id": [11814, 10021, 15582, 12154]}
