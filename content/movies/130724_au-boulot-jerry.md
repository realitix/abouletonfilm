Il se d\u00e9place ensuite dans une succession d'emplois qu'il re\u00e7oit lui-m\u00eame tir\u00e9 d'inclure un agent de station d'essence et un facteur - tous avec des r\u00e9sultats d\u00e9sastreux.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gHHFJAn5MxcKQd49FfuAryMhhUw.jpg", "actors": ["Jerry Lewis (Bo Hooper)", "Susan Oliver (Claire Trent)", "Roger C.

Jerry Lewis is funny right? How bad could this be?_ It's horrible. Fifteen minuets in and I am not even cracking a smile. Believe me, I like a good classic comedy. Especially some good tame light-hearted humor. But this was just horrendous. \r\n\r\nThe movie is essentially a bad sketch comedy film with various scenes of Jerry Lewis making a jackass out of himself. He stars as an out of work circus clown looking to fulfill various odd jobs. Each ending in disaster. Much like the disaster that this movie ended up becoming. \r\n\r\nIt's horribly dated, horribly offensive, horribly under-funded, horribly acted and written. It's just plain horrible. It might be the worst movie of 1980 and it's only my second feature in. \r\n\r\nJerry Lewis is way past his prime and just can't find the groove. I read that the producers had actually wanted to market this as competition for the superior Steve Martin picture, _The Jerk_. Taglines were actually   written as _The Original Jerk_. Can you believe that! _THE ORIGINAL JERK__!_"}], "recommandations_id": [36818, 99377, 87832, 68813], "youtube_key": "IkWENNOiwzY"}
