These somewhat inform images of natural events slowly morph into geometric grids with which moving human silhouettes are later juxtaposed before we are finally sent back to the abstract shapes that opened the film, now harmonised with these colour-looms and figurative forms.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cP0hHSHN2QqREw1Yw5FKtC1M3v6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
