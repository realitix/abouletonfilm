Mike is content on the farm and obviously attracted to the handsome Dan. Dan seems to be attracted to Mike as well but is a drifter and not happy as a farmer. He longs to finish out the contract and move on to a big city, perhaps with Mike. Gary, a boy from the next farm over, befriends them during their daily chores. Gary lives with his abusive father, a stepmother and a stepbrother. Gary is drawn to the camaraderie of the young farmhands in part to avoid his problems at home. When an innocent session of skinny-dipping is misconstrued by the boy's father, the young hired hands soon find themselves unjustly suspected of wrongdoing in a suddenly hostile small town.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6SIvXfShT6bKZ2B3nVDovHXxlUB.jpg", "actors": ["Nicholas Rempel (Mike)", "Todd Fraser (Dan)", "Asbury Ward (Jim Antonelli)", "Liam McGrath (Gary Antonelli)", "Dolores Dwyer (Terri Antonelli)", "Aaron Denney (Randy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
