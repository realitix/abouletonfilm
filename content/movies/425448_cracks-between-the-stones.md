It is just one authoritative voice in a collage soundtrack juxtaposed to Super-8mm footage that maps tourist images of the Southwest, Stonehenge and other candid \"evidence\" of civilizations present and past. Taking the smug yet also quaint manner of such instructional material as a starting point, American filmmaker Lipzin's 2004 film-on-video collage sets up a series of shrewd oppositions regarding our own understanding of ourselves. - Robert Avila", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5gvlDlaetHTshDHPopuQwFLzFQb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
