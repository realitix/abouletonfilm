But the movie is not without its flaws.\r\n\r\nTheo James seems almost lifeless as \u201cWill\u201d in this post-apocalyptic adventure \u2013 did he ever establish a character before getting on camera? It doesn\u2019t feel like it. James lumbers through scenes, lacks depth, and is just never believable as a man on a mission to save his pregnant fianc\u00e9 from impending doom.\r\n\r\nForest Whitaker is Forest Whitaker as the goateed \u201cTom\u201d who sets on a journey with Will, his soon-to-be son-in-law, to find his daughter Samantha. Whitaker rescues several of the scenes from being completely devoid of expression, but there is only so much you can do when the dialogue is itself so banal.\r\n\r\nHow It Ends plays like a short film that was extended to feature length. There were scenes that simply could have been cut, or at least shortened to keep the pace quicker. With the right editing, the one-hour, fifty three-minute film would have been more effective at ninety minutes. But maybe Netflix steers for lengthier content \u2014 the longer the program the longer viewers are streaming from the service \u2014 and that must be good for stockholders.\r\n\r\nEntire Review: <a href=\"https://hd-report.com/reviews/review-how-it-ends-netflix-original/\">\u2018How It Ends\u2019 (Netflix Original Film)</a> https://goo.gl/4rMqpU"}, {"pseudo": "Gimly", "content": "\"Okay, so basically, The Losers Club all get together for a rescue mission, and they head into the sewers by going through the well-house to face Pennywise, but the-\"\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}], "recommandations_id": [429415, 411143, 433249, 476926]}
