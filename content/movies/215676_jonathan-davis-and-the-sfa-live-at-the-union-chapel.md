It\u2019s obvious form his voice when he speaks with the audience just how grateful he is to them, and just who it is he\u2019s putting the show on for.  The music reads like Davis\u2019 personal selection of best-ofs, including several songs from \u2018Queen of the Damned\u2019 and \u2018Spawn\u2019  \u201cAlone I Break\u201d, one of Davis\u2019 favourites, is a high point on the album, but of the 15 tracks on the ones I enjoy the most are \u201cLast Legal Drug\u201d, \u201cForsaken\u201d, \u201cRedeemer\u201d and \u201cNot Meant For Me.\u201d  This is a brilliant must-have for everyone who\u2019s ever been a fan of Korn or Jonathan Davis as a singer and songwriter.  From the gothic d\u00e9cor of the Union Chapel venue to the ornately carved throne Davis sat in for most of the performance, this was the perfect setting for the show.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/umbNnn5QNI48J7xsNTKvv34Pxgi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
