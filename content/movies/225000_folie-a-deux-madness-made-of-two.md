Prophetic and surprisingly humorous, the narrative is driven by a tenacious single mother of seven, who risks bankruptcy and homelessness to fulfill a dream. Shot over five years and set in the oldest house in England. This film is an intimate portrayal of a large bohemian family with all the ups and downs of daily life, an intriguing insight into England's history, and future. This is a nail-biting journey through the economic crash and life's biggest gamble. This is not a story of the conspicuous consumerism of billionaires; rather this is the human cost of the banking crisis.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cPLw325xkhkissC5S1NwDv9GG3Z.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "CeXKNZsr_rE"}
