Interviews with former members of Eoan, photos, newspaper clippings, sound recordings, archive footage of opera performances and street scenes featuring the residents of District 6 in Cape Town give an impression of the world in which these people lived. By paying attention to the way in which the documentary was made \u2013 to questions that were not asked and answers that were not officially given \u2013 the painful truth behind the images and faces is gradually revealed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qLXMWFtnTkpUDFJImCzjd8BKz32.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
