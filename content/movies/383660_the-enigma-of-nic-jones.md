Almost every bone in his body was broken and neurological damage meant that he would never play his guitar in front of an audience again. Apart from a couple of tribute concerts, Nic Jones disappeared from the public eye for thirty years. Then in the summer of 2012, encouraged by friends and family, Nic returned to the stage to play several festival performances.. The concerts were a resounding success and for his old and new fans, a moving comeback for their musical hero.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l6yoSJHtyGJC9mOq9xUV7SptWsd.jpg", "actors": ["Nic Jones (Himself)", "Jim Moray (Himself)", "Eliza Carthy (Herself)", "Martin Carthy (Himself)", "Sam Carter (Himself)", "Blair Dunlop (Himself)", "Anais Mitchell (Herself)", "Ashley Hutchings (Himself)", "Stewart Lee (Himself)", "Martin Simpson (Himself)", "Chris Wood (Himself)", "Cerys Matthews (Herself)", "John Hegley (Himself)", "Joe Jones (Himself)", "Colin Irwin (Himself)", "Nigel Paterson (Himself)", "Julia Jones (Herself)", "Belinda O'Hooley (Herself)", "Helen Jones (Herself)", "Ian Anderson (Himself)", "Heidi Tidow (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
