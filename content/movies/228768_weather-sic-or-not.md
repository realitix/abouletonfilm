It is attached to Jerry's tail. \"Five miles, and I haven't gained an inch!\" reads an intertitle. Jerry looks behind at the can. Jerry runs through a hole in a fence but the tin can is too big to follow him through. Jerry runs on the spot until the string snaps. Jerry rolls along until he hits a cleat on the quayside. He looks at his tail and wags it to make sure that it is still working OK. He looks at the boat which is attached to the cleat: \"Here's a chance, I'll stowaway!\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gRkUe2YpfAFLBOs6QdmGn0AJUPn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
