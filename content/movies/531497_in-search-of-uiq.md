This script, which preoccupied Guattari\u2019s attention for seven years, represented a blueprint for a subversive popular cinema through an imagined hyper-intelligent infra-cellular life substance\u2014\u201cUIQ\u201d (Universe Infra-quark)\u2014capable of controlling global communications networks and plugging into the \u201cdesiring machines\u201d of a community of squatters. After discovering the unpublished script, Paris-based artists and filmmakers Silvia Maglioni and Graeme Thomson initiated a multiform research project that culminates in their film essay In Search of UIQ, which takes on Guattari\u2019s central quandary: how to give shape to a bodiless entity, seemingly without spatial or temporal limits.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A1PwwYYq7Esla6GrkF6L6WBJ9kR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
