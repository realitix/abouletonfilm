Compared to today's films, it certainly shows its age, but what it lacks in special effects (and picture quality if you can even find a good copy), Bad Ronald makes up for it in mood, tension, and imagination. Bad Ronald isn't the greatest piece of cinematic history, but if you were around when it first aired, you would certainly remember it."}], "recommandations_id": [27328, 41025, 39868, 86082], "youtube_key": "TgPT2WBRMlU"}
