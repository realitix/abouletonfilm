When we say you will see all of the Northern line on this one DVD that is what we mean. Running through the West End via Charing Cross and Tottenham Court Road, we see Camden Town once more but from a different perspective. Running into the open at East Finchley - a classic design of 1930s underground architecture we arrive at the terminus on the edge of Hertfordshire, High Barnet.  Finally, you will see the Mill Hill East branch starting from Finchley Central, nowadays the only single line tube branch on the entire underground.  All lines were filmed aboard brand new 1995 stock trains in bright weather using the latest digital cameras.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gWCRVy5juk9x4WqjGbNLiehH8os.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
