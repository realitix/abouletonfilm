Their stories represent successes that mainstream medicine and the public ought to know about.  Four of the featured subjects had been diagnosed with cancer; two of these patients were considered terminal cases. The fifth patient had a severe case of Lyme disease. All five have outlived their diseases, between 15 and nearly 40 years, thus far.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pCfBhcVX6HhKvmDkWviepk9XoyJ.jpg", "actors": ["Philip Incao (Himself)", "Sheryl Leventhal (Herself)", "Rita Znamirowsky (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
