The stage is a boxing ring. Those actors who are \"onstage\" get into the boxing ring and assault each other with words. Others heckle and cheer at the sidelines, or act as a rhythm-and-blues chorus while changing costumes or wigs. Taking as its coda Andy Warhol's dictum that everyone gets fifteen minutes of fame, actor transformations depict the Breakdown of Japanese values and selfhood due to an obsession with popular American culture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1FagPoaUuhznXiRrnM0pkhu1Wkv.jpg", "actors": ["Koichi Makigami ()", "Ky\u00f4ko Takami ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
