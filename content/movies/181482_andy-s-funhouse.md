It featured most of Andy's famous gags, including Foreign Man/Latka and his Elvis Presley impersonation, as well as a host of unique segments (including a special appearance by children's television character Howdy Doody and the \"Has-been Corner\"). There also is a segment that included fake television screen static as part of the gag, which ABC executives were not comfortable with, fearing that viewers would mistake the static for broadcast problems and would change the channel\u2014which was the comic element Kaufman wanted to present. Andy's Funhouse was written by Kaufman, Zmuda, and Mel Sherer, with music by Kaufman.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AbPpmK3qireqYYJ4JBVN00u1JjR.jpg", "actors": ["Andy Kaufman (Himself / Latka Gravas / Tony Clifton)", "Bob Zmuda (Himself)", "Wendy Polland (Herself (as Little Wendy))", "Chubby Rosalie (Herself)", "George Shapiro (Diner)", "Cindy Williams (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
