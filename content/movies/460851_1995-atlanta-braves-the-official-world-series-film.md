The Cleveland Indians won 100 games in a shortened season, and they made it to the World Series for the first time in 41 years. The Atlanta Braves had been here before, twice in the previous four years. With the best pitching staff in baseball, they were called the team of the '90's. Still they needed a World Series Title to claim that crown. This official documentary of the 1995 World Series includes all the dramatic moments of the six-game battle between the Indians and the Braves including: Eddie Murray's game-winning single at frenzied Jacobs Field. Orel Hershiser's gutsy performances against the incredible Greg Maddux. Dave Justice talking the talk...and then walking the walk. Tom Glavine, the series MVP, pitching one-hit baseball under phenomenal pressure.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1yNEjYgbae75MGHZgntQvW3oa2M.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Glavine (Himself)", "Greg Maddux (Himself)", "John Smoltz (Himself)", "Chipper Jones (Himself)", "David Justice (Himself)", "Ryan Klesko (Himself)", "Javier Lopez (Himself)", "Steve Avery (Himself)", "Bobby Cox (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
