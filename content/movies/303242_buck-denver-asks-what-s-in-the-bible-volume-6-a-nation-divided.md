In A Nation Divided, 39 kings take turns ruling the Israelites, and most of them do more harm than good. In fact, some of them even try to get rid of God\u2019s people forever! But that can\u2019t happen, so God sends good prophets like Elijah and Isaiah to remind the Israelites that the Lord is always with them. Still, hard times are ahead when foreign kings from Assyria and Babylon conquer Israel and Judah, burn the temple in Jerusalem, and take the Israelites away from their home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fzZwfmFAw30HWL16oDLz4HXV3uK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
