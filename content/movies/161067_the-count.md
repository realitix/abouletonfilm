Lindgren is the real thing, as far as swindlers go. Peter von Bagh asked him to play himself in a film that would reconstruct some of his greatest moments, i.e. the most flamboyant \u00abstunts\u00bb \u2013 and he agreed! So, marvel at Lindgren playing Lindgren, and study, on the film's second narrative string, how he's trying to get by, dancing and being charming through the summer of 1970, in dance-halls and pavilions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jvqOYagfx2MkluFarvl6RII9d1c.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
