Then life intervened, with marriage and children putting an end to her racing days. Now, after a 34-year break, Rosie is making a comeback. Urged on by her daughter and self-proclaimed manager, she tries to find sponsors. The road is uneven and behind her dreams of a comeback, there are depressions, burnout and family tragedies. This film is a revealing and complex portrait of a woman who gains strength by allowing herself to be weak. The fight to become the world's fastest grandmother is really the fight to reclaim one's own life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f31th1YyDrqNn5dxtX1p8myhNHF.jpg", "actors": ["Sabine Millberg (Herself)", "Rose-Marie Millberg (Herself)", "Peter Millberg Lantz (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
