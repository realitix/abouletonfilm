Set in 1960s Soho, the film delves into the world of UK and US organised crime, with gangland figures such as the Krays, boxing, gambling, police corruption and a string of brutal unsolved murders that would become synonymous with the name Freddie Mills. With access to eight hours of previously unseen home movies, this is an intimate portrayal of a man who rose from the humble surroundings of the fairground boxing booth to become world light-heavyweight champion and became a household name appearing on television and in films. But it all ended on 25 July 1965, when he was found shot dead in the back seat of his car.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/azgqa2bdRrCQFhweL85bJGZtn1z.jpg", "actors": ["Freddie Mills ((Archive Footage))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
