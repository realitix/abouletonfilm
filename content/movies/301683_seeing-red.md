One element is purely visual. One is very verbal and minimally visual. One is purely musical. So is red the color of a fire truck or a ruby, of rust or a rose, of blood or a brick? How fixed is a melody if it can be twisted, stretched and shaken to the point where we no longer recognize its original form? And when we \"see red,\" what color is that exactly? What aspect of passion are we feeling? Are we looking outward and seeing injustice and cupidity, or looking inward at our own limitations and failings?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cfaVSwf9obpc1W8R1nUir2qNIBM.jpg", "actors": ["Su Friedrich ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
