Cybil dreams about establishing a centre at the school that will provide a safe haven for the local children.  The problem is, Cybil\u2019s dream is in danger of collapsing before it even gets off the ground. The land Kalfieskraal is situated on is for sale, and none of the possible buyers are interested in her project. Not even her wealthy fianc\u00e9e, ostrich farmer Meyer Labuschagne, could be bothered about her project or the fate of the children.  Then Frans Coetzee comes into the story. A filmmaker with a broken heart, he is in the Klein Karoo with his team to make a documentary about social upliftment work in the area - and in the process hopefully forget about women, love, and all the baggage that comes with it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Y1FvwgRMkwvxCgMApYV4roNSTR.jpg", "actors": ["Donnalee Roberts (Cybil Ferreira)", "Tim Theron (Frans Coetzee)", "Hykie Berg (Meyer Labuschagne)", "Anel Alexander (Sophi Ferreira)", "Sisanda Henna (Bongi Mazibuko)", "Pierre Breytenbach (Karel De Villiers)", "Helene Truter (Hermientjie)", "Bouwer Bosch (Brian)", "Leandie du Randt (Jackie)", "Amalia Uys (Magriet)", "Ilse Oppelt ()", "Regardt van den Bergh (Estate Agent)", "Kobus van den Berg (Mr Gilbert)", "LLewellyn van den Berg (LLewellyn)", "Sunelle van den Berg (Sanet)", "Amelia Bosch (Co-op Assistant)", "Schalk van der Merwe (Sanets New Boyfriend)", "Damion Staz (Taxi Driver)", "Anzer Erasmus (Petrol Attendant)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "s1l6c8cfiRQ"}
