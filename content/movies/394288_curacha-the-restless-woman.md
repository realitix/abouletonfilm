Every night, she sets off to join her fellow toreras for a midnight show of fun and kitschy live sex act. In one tuning point of her life, she bumps into a long-lost friend, Myrna, a former torera, who seems to have a lost grip on life. Curacha makes it her personal mission to save Myrna as she does some sou-searching herself. In the end, we see traces of hope glimmering somewhere, somehow, in a manner that escapes the restless Curacha.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Rosanna Roces (Curacha / Corazon)", "Jaclyn Jose (Myrna)", "Ruby Moreno (Mabel)", "Ara Mina (Marie)", "Lucita Soriano (Zusette)", "Maureen Mauricio (Geleen)", "Mike Magat (Dennis)", "Dick Israel (Goloy)", "Tito Arevalo (Goloy)", "Lito Legaspi (Colonel)", "Tito Arevalo (Mang Ador)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
