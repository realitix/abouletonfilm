One band reigned supreme and toured far and wide across the eastern earth, but never even left Russia - until now. They only have once chance, to not only rule Russia -but to become the best band in the West. The strategy is simple - get on the boat, create an album - and make new friends. All with hopes of finally becoming a household name in the United States. But sometimes fame is harder than just toppling a government.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pytduz3R1erUGTsW6LdCt78iLeM.jpg", "actors": ["Ilya Lagutenko ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
