Albeit shorter than his prior voyage into horror film. This is at least a different story. Instead of this being a period piece, it appears to be a modern one.\r\n\r\nThe film shows George Melies, himself, having One Terrible Night with a creepy, crawly, spider. The film is one of dozens of shorts released during the era that focused more on drawing crowds biased on technology rather than the plot of a film. It is still going to be a few years before Horror is fully shaped and functioning.\r\n\r\nIf you are curious to see what film looked like in the 1800's then check out below where I have included the short."}], "recommandations_id": [104476, 104474, 104469, 104704], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
