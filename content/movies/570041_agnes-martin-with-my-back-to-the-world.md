This documentary was shot over a period of four years, from 1998 through 2002, Agnes Martin's ninetieth year. Interviews with Martin are inter-cut with shots at work in her studio in Taos, New Mexico, with photographs and archival footage, and with images of her work from over five decades. It is a venue for Martin to speak about her work, her working methods, her life as an artist, and her views about the creative process. She also discusses her film, \"Gabriel\" and reads from her poetry and lectures. In keeping with Martin's chosen life of solitude, she alone appears in the documentary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rtJ7uWVosbVx2EE6bBi59LtUsOi.jpg", "actors": ["Agnes Martin (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
