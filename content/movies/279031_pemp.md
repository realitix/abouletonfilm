From the initial recovery of their lands in 1957 through dealings with FUNAI in the 1970s and the appropriation of Brazil nut monopolies to their negotiations with the government in the eighties, Pemp shows the Parakat\u00eaj\u00ea\u2019s most precious project; the preservation of their ceremonies and songs. The Kokrenum, chief and keeper of the group\u2019s traditions, uses video to transmit them to future generations.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
