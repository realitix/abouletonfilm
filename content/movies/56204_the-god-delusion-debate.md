The debate centered on Dawkins's views as expressed in his best-seller, The God Delusion, and their validity over and against the Christian faith. Both presenters agreed to the format and topics of discussion. It was one of the great debates of the last 100 years and is well worth watching and studying.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xHsjNIzDO89Fjgok9FMs4SjyDmq.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Dawkins (Himself)", "John Lennox (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
