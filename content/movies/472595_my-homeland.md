Robert Vas escaped from his homeland after the brutal crushing of the 1956 Hungarian Uprising by the Russians and he was never able to return. He portrays his country through the writings of Hungary's national poets and illustrates the film with images of the Revolution and of the society it would become in the years immediately following 1956. The film was transmitted on the 20th anniversary of the crushing of the uprising.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Michael Bryant (Reader)", "Judi Dench (Reader)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
