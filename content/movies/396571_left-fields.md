Interviewing MCs, label operators, producers and bookers, \"Left Fields\" explores the network of genre-crossing artists such as Ceschi, Noah23, Babel Fishh, Th\u2019 Mole, Gonjasufi, Robot Koch, Comfort Fit, Fulgeance, Oskar Ohlson, and more, who collaborate within networks across the United States, Canada, Germany, Switzerland and Austria.  Working with a very limited budget, \"Left Fields\" tries to provide an insight into the alternative hip hop scene, exploring the spirit and maybe punk attitude of this movement, featuring various concerts, the development of art work (design, screen-printing, etc.) and of course the opinions and stories of everyone involved.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Noah23 (himself)", "Ceschi Ramos (himself)", "Gonjasufi (himself)", "Th' Mole (himself)", "Robot Koch (himself)", "Fulgeance (himself)", "Kay the Aquanaut (himself)", "Onry Ozzborn (himself)", "Zavala (himself)", "JamesPHoney (himself)", "Oskar Ohlson (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
