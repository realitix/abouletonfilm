During their trip, the state of their relationship becomes clear to them: They argue, take different paths and wonder whether to divorce. Vincent Dieutre has remade Viaggio in Italia and adapted it to his own life. Alex and Kate have become Alex and Tom, played by Vincent himself and his partner Simon. This new couple goes to the same places, experiences similar things, but their time in Naples is inevitably not the same. The city has changed, as has the nature of relationships, tourism has become more digital. As the two become increasingly alienated, Vincent the filmmaker moves through the city with his camera. He talks about how Rossellini\u2019s film shaped him. We hear his thoughts about a remake, notes to himself, his discussions with a copyright lawyer. In Vincent and Simon\u2019s world, much like that of Tom and Alex, the procession of the final scene gives way to a football match. What was still sacred back then becomes a riot here.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wrksyzoIkZ0BENv9wu8zi9mJWQu.jpg", "actors": ["Simon Versnel (Alex)", "Vincent Dieutre (Tom)", "Emmanuel Pierrat (Emmanuel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
