Dali devoted two weeks of his life to creating extraordinary scenes for the film, performing \"manifestations\" with a plaster cast. A thousand ants and one million dollars in cash. When he confronts the feminist writer, Jane Arden, sparks fly. \"You are my Slave! I am not your slave. Everybody is my slave.\" Dali recalls his meeting with Freud, \"The last human relationship ever\" About his wife, 'But for Gala I would be lying in a gutter somewhere covered with lice\" Jim Desmond's dazzling cinematography captures the great artist painting as Flamenco virtuoso Manitas de Plata performs. Dali in New York is a rare treat for anyone who loves film and the living theatre of Dali's surreal universe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oOJGiHXljMOCcjTI2mtNVYEQYC0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
