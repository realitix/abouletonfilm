That was a massive deal to me growing up, and this alone would make me a fan of _SLC Punk_, but even aside from that there is its unique filming style, solid acting presence and intense philospohical questions to push it over the line into worthwhile.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Very strong appeal.
