While going through his swiftly appointed rounds, Eddie stumbles upon a gang of crooks who are planning a large-scale confidence scam. He exposes the villains and wins the love of heroine Madge (Jobyna Ralston). Though Cantor was a fine physical comic, he didn't truly score in films until the arrival of talkies allowed his fans to hear as well as see him. Special Delivery was directed by \"William Goodrich,\" who in reality was comedian Fatty Arbuckle, hoping to stage a comeback after the sex scandal that destroyed his career.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/26HOInNBxbenvZMzs0fGvkk1tTV.jpg", "actors": ["Eddie Cantor (Eddie Beagle - the Mail Carrier)", "Jobyna Ralston (Madge Warren)", "William Powell (Harold Jones)", "Mabel Julienne Scott (Mrs. Jones)", "Jack Dougherty (Flannigan - the Cop)", "Donald Keith (Harrigan - the Fireman)", "Louis Stern (John Beagle)", "Marilyn Cantor Baker (Little Girl on Street)", "Marjorie Cantor (Little Girl on Street)", "Tiny Doll (Baby on Eddie's Route)", "Robert Livingston (Postal Ball Guest)", "Natalie Cantor Metzger (Little Girl on Street)", "Spec O'Donnell (Office Boy)", "Rosa Rosanova (Sidney's Mother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
