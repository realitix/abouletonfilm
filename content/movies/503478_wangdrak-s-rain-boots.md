It\u2019s good for the crops, but bad for Wangdrak. He\u2019s the only boy in his village who doesn\u2019t own a pair of rain boots \u2013 and the other children tease him about it. His father has no money to buy any boots, plus he has other worries: there\u2019s a dispute among the farmers. Secretly, his mother swaps a goat skin for a new pair of light blue boots. But when Wangdrak proudly wears them to school the next day, the children laugh at him again because it has stopped raining and the sun is shining. At least Wangdrak can count on his best friend Lhamo. Set in the vast mountains of Tibet this film affectionately portrays the story of a young boy\u2019s dreams which are bound by the traditional structures of rural life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hLbhdHGM1XF5GJCmGTVDYYw8qbu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
