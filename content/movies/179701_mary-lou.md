The opening scene has them dusting in matching head scarfs, our first hint that this young boy might grow up to bat for the other team. My favorite quote from the film is spoken by Miriam as she explains that \"it's easier to defeat dust than sadness.\"  Mom mysteriously leaves town during Meir's tenth birthday party. As a slightly built bleached blond teen of flamboyantly non-hetero appearance, Meir suffers through the stereotypical high school taunting. If you have watched enough Glee you already know that the worst tormentors are acting out of fear of their own sexual identity issues. Meir's beautiful gal pal Shuli makes life worth living as his trusted confidant and protector. (Shuli is played by Dana Frider, who was discovered on the Israeli version of \"So You Think You Can Dance.\")", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5uUVG24wsaoYbX82ihdH38o2uFo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
