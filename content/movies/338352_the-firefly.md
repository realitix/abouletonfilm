Hideji Yamaoka (Takakura) was a suicide pilot during the war who somehow survived Japan's surrender. After decades of working as a fisherman in Kumamoto, a provincial seaside city in southern Kyushu, Yamaoka remains reluctant to discuss his wartime experiences with anyone, much less an intrusive reporter looking for a feature story. Then a series of events shake Yamaoka to the core, forcing him to re-evaluate his past.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wgSZwBDU93TNL99AWBKzZV03475.jpg", "actors": ["Ken Takakura ()", "Y\u016bko Tanaka ()", "Isao Natsuyagi ()", "Ry\u00fbji Harada ()", "Takami Mizuhashi ()", "Ayako Kobayashi ()", "Kiichi Nakai ()", "Hisashi Igawa ()", "Tomoko Naraoka ()", "Nenji Kobayashi ()", "Renji Ishibashi ()", "Yukiyoshi Ozawa ()", "Y\u00fbko Fueki (Young Tomoko Yamaoka)", "Shigeo Kobayashi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
