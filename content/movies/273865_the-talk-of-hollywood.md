Pierpont Ginsburg, after declaring, in a Yiddish accent, that \"talking pictures are in their infantry,\" decides to put all of his savings into a big-budgeted musical, starring the sensation of Paris (with a bad French accent), Adore Renee, and a swishy leading man, Reginald Whitlock. Meanwhile, his daughter, Judy Ginsburg, gets involved in a romance with Ginsburg's Gentile lawyer, John Applegate. His efforts aren't helped any by the projectionist who mixes up the sound-disc reels, with the images not matching the dialogue and sound effects, during a showing for prospective film buyers and exhibitors.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uPWFohSIuZkVelLC89Pirt4f4ra.jpg", "actors": ["Nat Carr (J.
