Retrograde Premonition looks and sounds like floating mind, the vicissitudes of thought, feeling, and the senses. Not limited by the portrayal of actual events, this video works to encourage a roaming consciousness through images and sounds that may or may not be present. Pierce shoots these videos with a digital still camera hand held at long exposures and then weaves the stills into video shots. Each individual image bears the mark of time from motion blur, a blur that may in fact contradict the apparent motion of the frame. He composes the entire sound scape once picture editing is complete.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oYHqvQvJE2K4PtU3y9p0Pf8U296.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
