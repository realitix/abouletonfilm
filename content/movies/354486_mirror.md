Settings, which are gradually abandoned; the remains of an event, gazes that have lost their object. In MIRROR light alone sets the hardened images into motion. It simultaneously connects and separates the people, lifts them up and away from the space that binds them. Like in the axis of a set of mirrors, a tear rolls through the middle of the image. It separates the image into two halves, at the same time connecting them into a single motif.\r MIRROR creates an atmospheric image of the 'in between', the nameless sphere between belonging and isolation. \u2018The characters in a tragedy, the air they breathe, the settings, are sometimes more absorbing than the tragedy itself, as are the moments before and afterwards, when the plot is at a standstill and the dialogue is silenced.\u2019 (Michelangelo Antonioni)\"", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
