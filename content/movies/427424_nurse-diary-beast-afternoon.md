But, one dark and stormy night, the doctor and his assistant end up dead\u2026 hanging by ropes from the rafters of their lab. The lovely Reiko suffers from a condition known as \u201cgenophobia\u201d (the fear of sexual intercourse), so she is admitted to the Tachibana Clinic for observation. Another group of doctors have the \u201cDream Ring\u201d device and use it on Reiko to analyze her wildly erotic, and violent, dreams and nightmares. The clinic doctors have more sinister reasons to test this device on Reiko, however, and secretly put her under hypnosis so that the ring is activated at any time she hears the sound of a bell. Can she escape the evil doctors\u2019 experiment and, even if she does, who is that strange person, dressed all in black, following her around?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ggOZWe0TyEWfqxatoNy4tgoyGsB.jpg", "actors": ["Maiko Kazama (Ayako)", "Jun Miho (Reiko - Hypnotized Patient)", "Eimei Esumi (Shun'ichir\u00f4 - the Director of a Hospital)", "Maki Kawamura (Ikuko)", "K\u00f4z\u00f4 Murao (Jun)", "Hideo Shirayama (Katsuragi)", "Miki Yamaji (Naomi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
