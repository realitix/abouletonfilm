The all film turns around Frank (nicely played by Michael Patrick),He never knew his mum because she died giving birth to him,OK just to say with a plot like that the film could have been a catastrophe but because the character of Frank was played well enough it did'nt. In other Family drama with that kind of story the kid is always moaning and crying because he dos'nt know his mum or dad but Frank look more curious than depressed,Is acting like a real kid would in that situation,It's a simple but good thing about that film.\r\n\r\nAnd there is V,I don't agree with the comments which said she was a prostitute with a heart of gold far from it,V is very lost and she have very low self esteem.I think Melanie Griffith was lovely as V and it was different from character she usually play.\r\n\r\nNothing to say with Ed Harris,he did is best with very little to work with because we have to admit it that the Dad is a very flat and boring character.\r\n\r\nThe character of Anne Heche was supposed to be comic it was'nt instead you were wondering what the hell she was doing in that movie,the same go for Malcolm Mcdowell.\r\n\r\nthe film turns around the relationship between V and Frank which is well played by both Mickael and Melanie. Of course their is some annoying scenes with Frank's Friends and Heche/Macdowell but I think the film is what it was meant to be, a heart warming family film and I had quite a relaxing one hours and a half watching it."}], "recommandations_id": [12661, 25330, 34376, 11310]}
