There are absolutely imperfections in the movie, most of which I assume come to us from budgetary constraints, and even those aside, _Acrimony_ is still not exactly breaking moulds or blazing trail - but it is decent, and not exactly like anything I personally have seen before.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"}], "recommandations_id": [497814, 473149, 467432, 514619]}
