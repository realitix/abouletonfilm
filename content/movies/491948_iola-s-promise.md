She is truly grateful to Jack, and regards him as something different from other white people. Jack's sweetheart and her father are travellers in a wagon-train headed for this place, and, not having much luck so far, he is somewhat gloomy. Iola learns the reason, and promises to help him find gold. \"Will you?\" he says, \"Yes.\" \"Cross your heart?\" This cross-your-heart action mystifies Iola. She thinks it is a sort of tribe insignia and tells her people that \"Crossheart\" people are all right. Iola surely pays her debt of gratitude, not only in finding gold, but in giving her life to protect Jack's sweetheart from her own people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/me2obzTwyfZXWz3P1rJZqrbsrXV.jpg", "actors": ["Mary Pickford (Iola)", "Alfred Paget (Jack Harper)", "Frank Evans (Jack's Partner)", "Dorothy Bernard (Jack's Sweetheart)", "Frank Opperman (Frank's Sweetheart's Father)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
