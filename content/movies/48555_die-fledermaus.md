An exceptional cast--led by Hermann Prey and Kiri Te Kanawa as the couple whose marriage survives the comic indiscretions of three long acts--obviously has as much fun as the audience. Pl\u00e1cido Domingo leads the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House through its paces with panache. Prince Orlofsky's Act II party is always a splendid opportunity to pull out all the stops with surprise \"guests,\" and this performance makes the most of its chance: entering the proceedings to sing one of his tailor-made chansons, \"She,\" is French crooner Charles Aznavour, who is followed by dancers Merle Park and Wayne Eagling, their delightful pas de deux flashily choreographed by Sir Frederick Ashton.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mogpJ5Kn8j1oFoHnIcDu3DWNRch.jpg", "actors": ["Kiri Te Kanawa (Rosalinda)", "Hermann Prey (Babriel von Eisenstein)", "Dennis O'Neill (Alfred)", "Hildegard Heichele (Adele)", "Paul Crook (Dr. Blind)", "Benjamin Luxon (Dr. Falke)", "Charles Aznavour (Prince Orlofsky's Guest)", "Doris Soffel  (Prince Orlofsky)", "Michael Langdon (Colonel Frank)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
