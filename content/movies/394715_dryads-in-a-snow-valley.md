Their life may appear unrestrained and free of worldly cares but they cannot make it alone. All the work is done together with their cheerful neighbors. Then, in the spring of 2011, an earthquake strikes on the border of Nagano and Niigata prefectures. The Kogures\u2019 house is destroyed, but they decide to rebuild. An adventure told in a fantastical tone that expresses the joy of living with a sometimes harsh natural world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e3L8W2whfFplHbV5Bwsn08Pens6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "GlquvhaR-YE"}
