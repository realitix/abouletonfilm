The doctor, his cop friend, and a female reporter have their hands full trying to figure out who or what is responsible while a teenage boy suffering from horrible nightmares coinciding with the rapes is under suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe sad part is my summary has more clarity than this film. Suffering from plot holes, a subplot about Dr. Cordell's past that does nowhere and sloppy production, what could have been an interesting atmospheric marriage of 70s satanic films and 80s slasher films instead becomes its own victim and dies an uneventful death onscreen.\r\n\r\nI give it a 4/10\r\n\r\n**Toxic Fletch**"}], "recommandations_id": [31263, 40636, 41775, 27832]}
