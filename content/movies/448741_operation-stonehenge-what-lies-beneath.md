Why is it here? What is its significance? And which forces inspired its creators? Now a group of international archaeologists led by the University of Birmingham and the Ludwig Boltzman Institute in Vienna believe that a new state-of-the-art approach is the key to unlocking Stonehenge's secrets. For four years the team have surveyed and mapped every monument, both visible and invisible, across ten square kilometres of the sacred landscape to create the most complete digital picture of Stonehenge and the surrounding area over millennia. Operation Stonehenge takes the viewer on a prehistoric journey from 8000BC to 2500BC as the scientists uncover the very origins of Stonehenge, learning why this landscape is sacred, preserved and has been revered by following generations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3ialpRzZpPMIYJRGU9W78fruys3.jpg", "actors": ["Samuel West (Host)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
