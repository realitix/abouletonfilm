The film starts with the Jijon-pa (Supreme Gangsters) case. The shocking story is narrated through the discussion by the two detectives who arrested the gangsters, of details of the roundup, data screens, and the death sentence. Nevertheless, Nonfiction Diary\u2019s focus is not on the crime story. Starting from Jijon-pa onwards, the film reflects on the 1990s, when Korea digressed into contemporary history. The Seongsu Bridge and the Sampoong Department Store\u2019s collapses are recalled, followed by the then-government\u2019s punishment of the May 18 Uprising leaders, revealing the Korean legal system\u2019s death penalty status, touching on political and power issues. The audience is reminded that today, 2013, is an extension of that same flow.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xaRMfWTEUh1wmr8M8MiXPPD5Vvf.jpg", "actors": ["Chun Doo-hwan (Himself (archive footage))", "Roh Tae-woo (Himself (archive footage))", "Kim Young-sam (Himself (archive footage))", "Kim Dae-jung (Himself (archive footage))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
