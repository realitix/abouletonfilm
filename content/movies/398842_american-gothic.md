Although it's considered to be a visual satire on rural American Life, perhaps the story goes deeper than canvas. In this provocative horror tale by accliamed photographer, Carlos Batts, we see a different interpretation of a rural American Family on the 75th Anniversary of Wood's painting, American Gothic. Batts paints his own story and invites us into a world where the old farmer struggles with his crime of passion, the consequences and his iconic fate. A pcture may be worth a 1,000 words, but this painting's story will leave you speechless.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dG7VFkIr3jRArkdQCgH5uxwKwbx.jpg", "actors": ["Forrest Dunn (Father)", "Jennifer Kubel (Daughter)", "Lillian Centeno (Ghost Wife)", "Tricia Winslow (Little Girl #1)", "Shari Mapp (Little Girl #2)", "Suzanne Hee (Little Girl #3)", "Jason Vaughn (Necromancer #1)", "Shola Akinnuso (Necromancer #2)", "Jones Taylor (Zombie Slave #1)", "Mulu Johnson (Zombie Slave #2)", "Morgan Dupont (Buried Dead Man)", "Carlos Batts (Monster)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "a0N3Hm8AmjI"}
