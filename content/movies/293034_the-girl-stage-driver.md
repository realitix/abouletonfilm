When the stagecoach driver is murdered by the El Paso Kid and his sidekick, Ruth takes up her father\u2019s reins. On the road, she too fall preys to the bandits, who steal the stage\u2019s gold cargo. The sheriff, Ruth\u2019s sweetheart, rescues her, but he is taken captive by the desperados. The plucky Ruth rescues him once, and then again. Finally, with the help of a posse, the badmen are rounded up for good. Motion Picture News complained that the plot has \u201ca little too much escaping and recapturing\u201d but praised the Arizona settings.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Norbert A.
