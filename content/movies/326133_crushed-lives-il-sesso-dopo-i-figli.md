New father Saverio films a documentary to get to the bottom of this matter after an uninspired sex session with his wife. Interviewing couples at various stages of parenthood, Saverio unearths the fear and anxieties that seem to universally plague his peers as they collectively experience the quiet devastation of a dying bedroom. Honing in on this seldom fully explored theme of adulthood, director Alessandro Colizzi brings us on a sincere and funny journey into life encumbered by children and the fainting sexual imagination that seems to go with it. - Vivian Yuen", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/21zxwBg0V7L8werVNUhS92Sggen.jpg", "actors": ["Walter Leonardi ()", "Nicoletta Romanoff ()", "Bob Messini ()", "Euridice Ax\u00e9n ()", "Jacopo Cullin ()", "Melissa Bartolini ()", "Chiara Martegiani ()", "Carmen Giardina ()", "Cesare Apolito ()", "Paola Migneco ()", "Leonardo Sbragia ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [399347, 356461], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
