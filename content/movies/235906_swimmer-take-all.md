As usual, Bluto has a million ways to cheat, and Popeye overcomes all of them to win. Some of the bits: Popeye's suit is connected to a fish hook; the fish unravels it and Popeye knits it back together. Bluto is on a raft and blows sneezing powder at Popeye. Bluto attaches a magnet to Popeye which attracts a mine (which ends up blowing Popeye much closer to the line). Bluto dumps a load of cement on Popeye.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
