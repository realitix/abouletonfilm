Victor is seven. He hates ADHD, believing it\u2019s something to do with his club feet. Martine is quick to become withdrawn, and struggles with uncontrollable rage when things do not go her way. For the most part, Marino keeps to himself, but easily becomes aggressive. Victor, Martine and Marino are in a special class in a normal school in Denmark. The class teachers and the children\u2019s parents decide to take part in an alternative treatment project focusing on the individual child\u2019s challenges and possibilities, rather than relying on medical diagnosis and medication. The film follows the whole process, and shows how the children make great strides over the course of a year, as the adults around them start to see each individual child in a new light", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cgRXHcabx9v4YtUWrrliDNzIO50.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
