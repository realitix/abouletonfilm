When the best man eventually does show up, he causes a few problems since he ran through some tar just before entering the church. The groom doesn't seem to mind too much, just as long as the best man brought the ring, which he did. But as the wedding proceeds, that sticky tar just can't help but get the best man into one disastrous incident after another, including with the ring. That havoc, which leads into the reception, the wedding night and the honeymoon send off, may end the marriage even before it begins... or at least the couple's friendship with their best man.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Billy Bevan (Best Man)", "Vernon Dent (Groom)", "Alma Bennett (Bride)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
