Among those exiles were a number of writers and poets, including Yannis Ritsos and Tassos Livaditis. Despite the deprivation and torture, they managed to write poems which describe the struggle for survival in this world of internment. These texts, some of them buried in the camps, were later found. \u00abLike Lions of stone at the gateway of night\u00bb blends these poetic writings with the reeducation propaganda speeches constantly piped through the camps\u2019 loudspeakers. Long tracking shots take us on a trance-like journey through the camp ruins, interrupted along the way by segments from photographic archives. A cinematic essay, which revives the memory of forgotten ruins and a battle lost.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/idN2TacMLQDoT5s1CAanaSHv5Jg.jpg", "actors": ["Jean-Claude Dauphin (Voice)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
