Frank Baum in 1900 is loaded with powerful symbols of monetary reform which were the core of the Populist movement and the 1896 and 1900 president bid of Democrat William Jennings Bryan. The yellow brick road (gold standard), the emerald city of Oz (greenback money), even Dorothy\u2019s silver slippers (changed to ruby slippers for the movie version) were the symbol of Baum\u2019s and Bryan\u2019s belief that adding silver coinage to gold would provide much needed money to a depression-strapped, 1890s America. We believe Baum\u2019s symbols represent the only solution to relieve the growing economic hardship here in America \u2013 and the rest of the world. Practically speaking, 2009 marks the 70th anniversary of the 1939 MGM release of the The Wizard of Oz movie, so interest will be very high. Even Oz websites put up by kids get millions of hits.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uj9RtQ7RWwriQ9M2jvlOAomspKc.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Schiff (Himself)", "Ellen Brown ()", "Bill Still (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "U71-KsDArFM"}
