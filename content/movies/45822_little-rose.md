Not particularly interested in serving communism but eager to please her domineering lover, Kamila accepts the mission, reporting under the code name \"Little Rose.\" As quick scenes contrast Kamila's crude pleasures with Rozek and her more refined experiences with Warczewski, it becomes clear that the more time the unschooled young woman spends with the professor, the more she comes to have true feelings for him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/otVsOPGOZKBnr17UkEvCAgd5uPa.jpg", "actors": ["Andrzej Seweryn (Adam Warczewski)", "Magdalena Boczarska (Kamila Sakowicz)", "Robert Wi\u0119ckiewicz (Roman Rozek)", "Jacek Braciak (SB Officer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [81213, 257545, 36384, 89156], "youtube_key": "l_Ht7hDVW2Y"}
