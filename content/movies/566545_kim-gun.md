Starting with the vague memories of those who had crossed paths with him during that time, the film tracks down those who participated in the Uprising as \u201cCitizen Soldiers.\u201d It also traces KIM\u2019s final steps, based on photographic clues found in the firearms he carried and the \u201cSurveillance Truck No. 10\u201d in which he rode. By identifying KIM-GUN, we believe that we can find valuable leads to resolving the ongoing controversy over May 18. Why did a nameless young man join the Uprising? Why did he take up arms? Where has he gone afterwards? It is the answers to these questions that the film seeks.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fYtWZ9QscrLjZYcbvLsYPrbBidg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
