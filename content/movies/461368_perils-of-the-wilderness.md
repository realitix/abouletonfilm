In Canada, Randall is a little more upscale and uses a hydra-plane and a fake totem to over-awe the Indians. Laramie is aided in his search by RCMP Sergeant Gray and by Donna Blane, who is suspected at first of giving information to Randall, but who is actually a Canadian secret agent investigating Randall's gun-trading with the Indians.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xxErJtyMEXkrXxZ2DNcvyUWmtIS.jpg", "actors": ["Dennis Moore (Deputy Marshal Dan Mason, aka Laramie)", "Richard Emory (Sergeant Gray)", "Evelyn Finley (Donna Blaine (as Eve Anderson))", "Kenneth MacDonald (Bart Randall (as Kenneth R.
