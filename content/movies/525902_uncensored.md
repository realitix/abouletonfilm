They are so effective that the Nazis offer a reward for the capture of the paper's staff, although they don't know their identities. One of them is a well-known entertainer, and when his jealous partner hears of the reward, he turns him in. The paper's publishers escape capture, but their staff doesn't. The paper's founders must find not only a way to keep from getting captured by the Nazis but keep their newspaper going and get their staff released.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Eric Portman (Andre Delange)", "Phyllis Calvert (Julie Lanvin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
