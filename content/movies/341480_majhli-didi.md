Things are delicate even after both women give birth to two children each. Then Hemangini testifies against Navinchandra in Court, leading to the division of the property. Things got worse by the arrival of Kadambini's orphaned school-going step-brother, Kishan, who is beaten and abused by not only by Kadambini and Navinchandra, but also by their overweight son. When Hemangini objects to Kishan's ill-treatment, Bipin takes the side of the rest of the family, and may probably force her to abandon Kishan to his fate or divorce her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/faG5eFeddMQrv7hFcG2GKnI0K2X.jpg", "actors": ["Meena Kumari (Hema)", "Dharmendra (Bipinchandra 'Bipin')", "Leela Chitnis (Kishan's Mother)", "Sachin Pilgaonkar (Kishan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
