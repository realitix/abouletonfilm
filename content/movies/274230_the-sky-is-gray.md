Gaines, author of \"The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,\" comes a deceptively simple, yet emotionally complex tale of a young boy's discovery of what it's like to be black in Louisiana during the 1940's. James, the boy in question, has a raging toothache that necessitates a trip to the dentist. His mother (played by Emmy-winner Olivia Cole), accompanies James to town on an eye-opening odyssey where the boy gains valuable insights into poverty, racism - and his own sense of pride. With an exciting musical score by Webster Lewis, this multi-award winning film explores a child's discovery that the world is a complicated place... where things are never truly black or white... only shades of gray. -  Olivia Cole, James Bond III, Margaret Avery", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lXgUN8v0D85McqXy8XGVlGUEUz2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
