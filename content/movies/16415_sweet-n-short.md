After Sweet gets drunk one night at his birthday party, he misses a sportscast and his boss, Bryce Williams demotes him to interviewer and promotes Weedle. A subplot of the film are two robbers, \"Bossy\" and \"Savage\" who the main characters remain remotely unaware of as they are just a comic theme. Sweet pulls a prank on Weedle during a golf game and is suspended for six month. Sweet also records Weedle having humorous intercourse with a prostitute, \"The Orphan in a Storm\". Sweet then decides to drown his sorrows in a casino at the slot machines, where he tricks a small boy, Alfred \"Shorty\" Short into thinking he is a genie. Bossy and Savage try to rob the casino when they accidentally break the disco ball and it knocks Sweet unconscious just as he hits the jackpot.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gCfHWNcmNay1SZZyVS3EFdO34Kl.jpg", "actors": ["Leon Schuster (Sweet Coetzee)", "Alfred Ntombela (Alfred Short)", "Casper De Vries (George Weedle)", "Rufus Swart (Longdrop Botha)", "Joanna Weinberg (Sandy)", "James Borthwick (Shawn Raymond)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [16419], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
