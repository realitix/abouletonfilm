Just ask him. Sure, he picked up a \"skin thing\" on his vacay in The Caribbean, and he's hungering for brains, but who isn't? Anyway, things are bound to get better when Ted inherits his grandpa's fortune; all he's gotta do is wait for the old man to die.

Things just went from weird to wacky.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jIcGtk0MOCxr6p1JhpiHb4jejX5.jpg", "actors": ["Kane Hodder (Frank Lee)", "Naomi Grossman (Carrie)", "Gary Anthony Williams (Bradley)", "Cameron McKendry (Ted)", "Akari Endo (Livia)", "Sandi McCree (Jean)", "Tanya Chisholm (Bonnie)", "Chris Attoh (Ricky)", "Timothy Brennen (Poppy)", "Liche Ariza (Jorge)", "Sanya Mateyas (Linda)", "Tami Brockway Joyce (Dr. Lovido)", "Christina Nigra (Elvie)", "Chad Eric Smith (Wolfgang)", "Mary Druzba (Mel)", "Jordan Liddle (Grendel)", "Izzy Church (Nora)", "David Kallaway (Sgt.
