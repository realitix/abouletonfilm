A film this dangerous hasn't been seen since Cannonball Run 2. Heath Kirchart and Jeremy Klein are two skateboarders just out to have a good time in a race across the good old US of A. Rescued after a near death skateboarding accident, the two show off their amazing ability to cause destruction while a sinister cop, with an agenda of his own, tires to bring them down. The top notch story, an all-star cast (Eric Estrada, Tony Hawk, Ming Tran), and a special guest appearance by the Hook-Ups Destruction Van, makes Destroying America this year's hottest movie.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zvBqC1t2M3w4rJBvQRKiFRXK2f9.jpg", "actors": ["Tony Hawk (Himself)", "Bam Margera (Himself)", "Erik Estrada (Himself)", "Brandon DiCamillo (Himself)", "Heath Kirchart (Himself)", "Ming Tran (Herself)", "Jeremy Klein (Himself)", "Willy Santos (Himself)", "Dan Rogers (Himself)", "Rachel Sterling (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
