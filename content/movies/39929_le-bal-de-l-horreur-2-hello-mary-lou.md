When her spirit is inadvertently released thirty years later, she wreaks havoc on prom night seeking to be queen again, not to mention obtaining revenge. Michael Ironside plays the principal of the school, the man responsible for the girl\u2019s death decades earlier.\r\n\r\nSometimes subtitled \u201cHello Mary Lou,\u201d \u201cProm Night II\u201d (1987) is disconnected from the original 1980 film with Jamie Lee Curtis, although there are some trivial links. This one discards the disco dancing while upping the ante with the \u201cCarrie\u201d (1976) elements and mixing in components from the first two \u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street\u201d flicks (1984/1985), like the illusions and possession.\r\n\r\nThe original was more of a coming-of-age drama/whodunit with a masked assailant appearing in the last act whereas this sequel is actually a little better in that it adds creative horror pizazz, which some might say makes it \u201ccheesy.\u201d In any case, Wendy Lyon stands out as the winsome protagonist who\u2019s shown totally nude on a few occasions in the second half which ties-in with the possession angle.\r\n\r\nIf you favor any of those other horror films noted above, \u201cProm Night II\u201d is arguably on par, although I suppose \u201cCarrie\u201d is superior on a technical level. \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 37 minutes and was shot in Edmonton, Alberta, with other stuff (post-production) done in Toronto.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"}], "recommandations_id": [41828, 41769, 36599, 26958]}
