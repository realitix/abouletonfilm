Among the gags: As Roland plays the harp, Rattfink tries to discourage him by drumming. When that fails, he inverts the drum to reveal a beehive; the bees attack, the harp strings send Roland back into a fountain, and the bee-stung Roland still presents Rattfink with a flower. Rattfink air-drops a bag of flour on Roland; the resulting cloud of flour engulfs RF's plane, and he crashes into a building. Finally, Roland is in a jam session; Rattfink paints a can of nitroglycerine to look like a drum, but slips on a banana peel and explodes. Roland puts a flower on his grave; Rattfink's ghost hurls it at Roland.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bKWAfnUn7lJaGsG0OIF8b8ntXuT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
