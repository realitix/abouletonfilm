Ngor was forced into labor camps by the Khmer Rouge, little did he know he would escape years of torture and recreate his experiences in a film that would win him an Academy Award\u00ae. \"The Killing Fields of Dr. Haing S. Ngor\" tells the dramatic story about arguably the most recognizable survivor of the Cambodian genocide, a man who became a worldwide ambassador for justice in his homeland, only to be murdered in a Los Angeles Chinatown alley - a case still muddled with conspiracy theories. Through an inspired blend of original animation and rare archival material - anchored by Ngor's richly layered autobiography - the years encapsulating the Khmer Rouge's tyrannical rule over Cambodia are experienced though a politically charged transnational journey of loss and reconciliation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9BPUGc98U89H9cPuJXSZfbxyQt7.jpg", "actors": ["Haing S.
