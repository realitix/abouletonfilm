Between March 13 and August 2, 1939, Nicholas Winton organized 8 transports to take children from Prague to new homes in Great Britain, and kept quiet about it until his wife discovered a scrapbook documenting his unique mission in 1988. Winton was a successful 29-year-old stockbroker in London who \"had an intuition\" about the fate of the Jews when he visited Prague in 1939. He quietly but decisively got down to the business of saving lives. We learn how only two countries, Sweden and Britain, answered his call to harbor the young refugees; how documents had to be forged and how once foster parents signed for the children on delivery, that was the last he saw of them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4GWPtjU0EjOV79b5GwYNnmVtKma.jpg", "actors": ["Nicholas Winton (himself)", "Karel Reisz (Himself)", "V\u00e1clav Havel (Himself)", "Simon Wiesenthal (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
