It arrives in a house, a child's voice recites Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky,\" and various objects, such as toys and dolls, move about, disintegrate, and play out archetypal scenes. Like Carroll's verse, the images are at once familiar and unfamiliar. A child's play suit, hanging in the wardrobe, becomes the adventure's protagonist.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g2ZVNlHc1UrlSHbhUhYEqfCbv6S.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [104275, 59363, 193497, 150935], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
