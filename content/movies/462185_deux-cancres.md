Completing the school tasks is an agony that oppresses the creative passion of a restless, imaginative boy. His father gets deeply involved so he can understand what the problem is, and spends an hour every day to help him with his homework. Days, weeks, years go by, and we observe how the eagerness to learn clashes with the ghost of school dropout. The endearing relationship between father and son, a real rollercoaster of emotions, reveals with a sense of humour the contradictions in the French education system.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1ZCEnVIkvs710nP5vL4ZrNW9tQr.jpg", "actors": ["Ludovic Vieuille ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
