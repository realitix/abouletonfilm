OK, scratch that. She's a freak. In fact, she loves thinking back to the good old days when a pervert tried to touch her chest as a little girl and a later encounter where a man tried to bite her during sex. So it should come as no surprise that after she's raped in the park, her trauma registers as nonexistent and she's getting down and dirty with a lesbian pick-up about two minutes later. Ah, the 70s.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AoHT3BCrQFVlc3eW452CA4pcFqS.jpg", "actors": ["Anna Travers (Jennifer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
