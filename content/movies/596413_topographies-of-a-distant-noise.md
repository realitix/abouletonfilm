These images are processed and vectorized frame to frame. It focuses on the textures that emerge by shaping terrain, shapes and forms, proposing a permanent play between the formal limits among abstraction and figuration. It seeks to put in tension the referent of the film; what it has been (characters in a space-time recorded with a camera ) along with what it is (figures dissolved in surfaces and reliefs of a visual and sonorous matter in constant mutation and alteration).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4qKS2uqC1OSs8ySJbKzuS4driJJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
