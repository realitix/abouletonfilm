The attractive teen is tending a flock of sheep in the middle of nowhere, nowhere except for an adjacent military base. One of the pilots at the base has a penchant for flying low over the sun-bathing maiden as he snaps a photo or two of her on the ground. This is a whole new way of making a pass, but it works. He later arranges to contact her and brings his photos with him, along with his dishonorable intentions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/96EKbrOBt2YK2LfWqD2bhw7iYFN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
