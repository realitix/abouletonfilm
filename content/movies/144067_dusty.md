Roaming the fertile fields of Australia, Dusty is captured as a puppy. Though dingoes are normally averse to human companionship, Dusty attaches himself to an old, worn-out shepherd, played by Bill Kerr. The dog gives Kerr a reason for living, and vice versa. Be sure to have plenty of Kleenex handy for some of the mistier passages of Dusty.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/85eDMznFy84Jt5PHjAycHSxIG0i.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Kerr (Tom Lincoln)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
