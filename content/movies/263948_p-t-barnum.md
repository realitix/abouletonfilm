Barnum, America's greatest showman and promoter. Starting as a young man who managed an old woman who was supposedly George Washington's nursemaid, we see his career as he finds success promoting curiosities and attractions with panache and a judicious mix of truth and creativity, whether it be promoting his museum or characters like the midget General Tom Thumb. Yet because the demands of his businesses, his family life is troubled and marred by tragedy. All the while, events lead to his greatest creation, the Ringling Brothers/Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hhWsZhulnrBPR4kgjLHNH25yys3.jpg", "actors": ["Beau Bridges (P.T.
