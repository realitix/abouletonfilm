This Emmy award-winning program tells the unforgettable story of ordinary people caught up in a mind-numbing disaster. Told through vivid first-hand accounts and stunning archival footage, Angels Too Soon is also the story of a fire that remains officially unsolved, despite the detailed confession of a 10-year-old student in the school.  Above all, it is a story of faith, hope and courage, the day that 92 children became Angels Too Soon.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3U6ALpZDuU2VL8xuZNhKq7cFxWL.jpg", "actors": ["John Callaway (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
