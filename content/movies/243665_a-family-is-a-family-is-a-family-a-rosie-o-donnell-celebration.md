Rosie O'Donnell looks at the many answers to this question in this documentary that features original songs and thoughtful kids musing on love and family. The show provides a less than moving portrait of the remarkable diversity of so called families today, including same-sex parents, mixed-heritage families, and stories of adoption. Animated songs and musical performances by kids and families spice up the festivities along with performances and recordings by artists including Ziggy Marley, Bonnie Raitt, Doris Day, Sweet Honey in the Rock, Frank Sinatra, Rosie O'Donnell and They Might Be Giants.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/15zmRYeIwmtBIvor5NM4Xdhg2lt.jpg", "actors": ["Rosie O'Donnell (Herself)", "Ziggy Marley (Himself)", "Elizabeth Mitchell (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
