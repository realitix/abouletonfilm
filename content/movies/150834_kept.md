The dead men were interns at the firm, and each of them was Barbara's lover (kept in a classy flat she owns and observed via closed-circuit TV by the applauding Lance). Kyle is Barbara's latest intern and lover, and he may be in danger. He also starts to fall in love with Barbara, and the feeling may be mutual. In the background are Erin, Lance and Barbara's myopic administrative assistant, and Tony, Kyle's one-time roommate who also knows Barbara. Can the cops solve this before too many more die?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/keJJJ6Dy99ECzFXIASUz3lvYWBv.jpg", "actors": ["Cal Bartlett (Arthur)", "Sondra Currie (Natalie)", "Paul Michael Robinson (Tony)", "Art Hindle (Lance)", "Rigg Kennedy (Jules)", "Micah May (Jeff)", "Rudy Mettia (Jason)", "Yvette Nipar (Avery)", "Christian Oliver (Kyle)", "Laura Rose (Erin)", "P.J.
