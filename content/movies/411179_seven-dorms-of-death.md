Unfortunately, the last time (and only time) this particular play was put into production, the college's auditorium burned down and the entire cast and crew were killed. But that was over 100 years ago, and the head of the Drama Department has no fears that any such catastrophe will stop his production.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xD9YOEFuZf0M58ixtoa4doMMNs8.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Griffin (director)", "Anna Rizzo (Severein)", "Graham King (Chad)", "Michael Thurber (Baron Von Blah)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
