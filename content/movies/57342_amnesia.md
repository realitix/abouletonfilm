Town locals Sandro (Diego Abatantunono), a pornographic film director, and Angelino (Sergio Rubini), the manager of a beachside watering hole, find their very different lives overlapping. Meanwhile, the island police chief (Juanjo Puigcorbe), who is currently at odds with his rebellious son Jorge (Ruben Ochandiano), is investigating the death of a drug dealer (which was accidentally brought on by Angelino). Jorge's plans to move to America have so far been thwarted by his father, but when he finds out about the affair his dad had been having with a male nightclub dancer, he uses it as blackmail fodder.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r2J006SNBc5WadZtetKCg8h2VpW.jpg", "actors": ["Diego Abatantuono (Sandro)", "Sergio Rubini (Angelino)", "Martina Stella (Luce)", "Bebo Storti (Ernesto)", "Ugo Conti (Dani)", "Antonia San Juan (Pilar)", "Rub\u00e9n Ochandiano (Jorge)", "Alessandra Martines (Virginie)", "Ram\u00f3n Salazar (Emilio)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [46028, 65038, 43592, 56899], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
