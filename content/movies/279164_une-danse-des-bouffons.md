Using a recreation of Marcel Duchamp's Etant Donnes, a trickster of old mythology awakens Maria Martins (played by Kim Gordon) from the dream state. She learns that her lover, a captive Marcel Duchamp, has been kidnapped by a group of terrorists and forced to recite the chess moves to a historical match. Maria must enter a deep and strange rabbit hole to save her love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e4UOST7qdB0LvT6Y8rLldoM8gFM.jpg", "actors": ["Jon Bulette (The Bull God)", "Carin Cahn (Etant Donnes)", "Kim Gordon (Maria Martins)", "Jason Grisell (Marcel Duchamp)", "Hannelore Knuts (Maria Martins)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "2kAfSPOjr9M"}
