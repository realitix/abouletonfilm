Dr. Hofbauer, a frequenter of this establishment, stages a surprise spectacle for the patrons, which serves as a pretext for an orgy. Josefine and her girls go to the country for a picnic where they encounter a hunting party of gentlemen. One of them is Herr Kirchner who tells Josefine that his good-for-nothing son Loisl is going to Vienna to learn carpentry. He sends Loisl to Josefine's house. Josefine and Annie give him a detailed lesson. Then, Loisl goes to Meister Wehringer to become his apprentice. Wehringer has an inquisitive sixteen-year-old daughter named Maria. Loisl tells her about his experiences at Josefine's house and attempts to give her a lesson himself. However, Wehringer catches them. He fires Loisl and says that he'll write to his father about his misconduct. In desperation Loisl goes to Josefine.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zukuoCKzC3HNsqFh9QJcsYJPiRX.jpg", "actors": ["Andrea Werdien (Josefine Mutzenbacher)", "Melitta Berger (Uschi)", "Hans-Peter Kremser (Loisl)", "Monika Zierer (Maria)", "Peter Strasser (Meister Wehringer, Maria's father)", "Margitta Hofer (Miezi)", "Christine Neona (Theres)", "Erwin Neuhauser (Musiker auf der Orgie)", "Rainer Abendroth (Gast auf Feier (uncredited))", "Siggi Buchner (Gast auf Feier (uncredited))", "Sepp Gneissl (Xaver Kirchner (uncredited))", "Peter Steiner Jr. (Dr Hofbauer (uncredited))", "Elisabeth von Ihering (Frau Wehringer (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
