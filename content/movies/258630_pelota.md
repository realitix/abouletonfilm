The film gives an impression of the game itself and of those who play it, not only the star performers (and the myths that surround them), but also those who just play in the streets and alleyways. The film sees the game it its cultural context and conveys the emotions and stories that are peculiar to the Basque country.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nQJsowbY4jyGH4kZvtgu33Jkrqq.jpg", "actors": ["Jean-Pierre Laruche (Himself)", "Joseph Laduce (Himself)", "Cipriano Ruiz (Himself)", "J.M.
