He walks head down, sad, in suit, hat, and wire-rim glasses. In this nearly wordless animation, bad things happen to him. First an elevator malfunction leads to a trip to the hospital: he leaves with his arm in a sling. Another accident at work results in another hospital visit. The same indifferent stretcher bearers and the same indifferent nurse see to his care. Now, his leg is in a cast as well as his arm. He soldiers on, using a cane. When a traffic sign malfunctions, it's back to the hospital; he leaves with bandaged head, piloting a wheelchair. But his woes aren't over yet. After one more mishap, Philip Jenkins finally has something to say.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/P7YxZx28LxENVZWoj4OrguuzDx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
