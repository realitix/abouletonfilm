Like most of the early work of the writers, David Hare and Howard Brenton, committed radical (if not revolutionary) socialists throughout the 1970s, it is a satirical attack on capitalist greed and corruption, full of savage, and often disturbing, humour.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1ZBb7rhqC9tdohR7bY3X8YpN8bq.jpg", "actors": ["Jeremy Kemp ()", "Susan Penhaligon ()", "David Daker ()", "Roger Lloyd Pack ()", "Allan Surtees ()", "Andrew Ray ()", "Paul Dawkins ()", "Peter Howell ()", "Sheila Reid ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
