He starts with making his own kind of please-turn-off-your-cell-phone announcement, as well as a warning not to text or tweet during the show: \u201cJust live your life,\u201d he asks. Whether he\u2019s talking about a unique way to drop a rental car off at an airport or describing why a man in his 40s should not smoke dope, it\u2019s terrific, humane, carried-to-crazed-extremes stuff.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7IB9s2Oyjr6VVYXm1vDazQgdGFF.jpg", "actors": ["Louis C.K.
