The basic plot involves a time traveler who goes one hour into the future and finds most of his colleagues dead. He then travels back in time to prevent that outcome from ever occurring.\r\n\r\nThe movie is not particularly well acted and has a definite low budget feel. There is quite a bit of cursing that almost seems forced to make it seem edgy. If you like time travel movies, you will still enjoy Paradox. However, I would not recommend this movie to your average movie goer even if they are a science fiction fan."}], "recommandations_id": [90291, 282313, 381170, 60819], "youtube_key": "O3NbTILaL0Q"}
