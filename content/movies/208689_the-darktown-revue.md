This quietly outrageous film begins with the high-toned Heywood Choir singing \"Watermelon time\" and concludes with Amon David playing a preacher using heavy blackface. Amon Davus was known as \"the Back Biting Comedian, Par Excellence\", and his sermon is one of Michaeux's many notable send-ups of the clergy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nMgwBnG0unWuK096s4mgiGSv2Ij.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
