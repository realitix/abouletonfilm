A sequence of vignettes that could loosely be described as sketches, most featuring large, naked women in a variety of \"hilarious\" situations, linked by a combed-over MC who laughs at his own jokes. Lots of prefab video effects, lots of disco music, lots of shot-on-video stupidity. Guaranteed to make your brain dribble out your nostrils.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mEOuqO2I2xBmEBSdR1w7docX946.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
