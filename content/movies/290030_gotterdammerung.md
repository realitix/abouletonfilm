The Met orchestra, chorus, and an all-star cast make this G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung one that truly rises to the occasion. Hildegard Behrens\u2019s Br\u00fcnnhilde must be experienced to be believed, as does Matti Salminen\u2019s richly sung, domineering Hagen. At the center of the drama is Siegfried Jerusalem as Siegfried, who does not realize he has been drawn into a plot of betrayal until it is too late. Christa Ludwig is magnetic as Waltraute and Ekkehard Wlaschiha is a compelling Alberich.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jPai04oMSK7Ihx1m0RhUZ8QP5tX.jpg", "actors": ["Hildegard Behrens (Br\u00fcnnhilde)", "Siegfried Jerusalem (Siegfried)", "Matti Salminen (Hagen)", "Christa Ludwig (Waltraute)", "Anthony Raffell (Gunther)", "Hanna Liskowska (Gutrune)", "Ekkehard Wlaschiha (Alberich)", "Gweniet Bean (1.
