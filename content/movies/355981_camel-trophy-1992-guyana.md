From dense jungle tracks to flooded savannah plains, Camel Trophy '92 covered some of the most diverse and spectacular scenery in South America. Equipped with identically prepared Land Rover Discoverys, the sixteen amateur teams from four continents set off from Manaus, Brazil on their 1600km journey, covering some of the remotest and formidable territory in the world before reaching their destination of Georgetown, Guyana. Participants soon realise that no one man can hope to achieve this goal alone. Team work, patience and above all, a sense of humour play a vital role if the convoy is to reach its final destination.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cH9lvhqBy9KbgQ4zTfY8gQrOwe3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
