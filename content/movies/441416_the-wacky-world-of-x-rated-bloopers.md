A telling number, don't you think? that's the complete cast listing for this fascinating new video from Gourmet. Kudos to Ron Wasserman for assembling the results from the inexhaustible supply of way footage from the Gourmet vaults. Wacky World is a far cry form just another blooper reel \u2014aside from the flubbed lines, failed erections, and impossible-to-maintain positions, this item also provides a (pardon the pun) penetrating look behind the scenes of the adult film business. Of particular interest are snippets where Ron Jeremy gets quite pissed when the cameras roll before his famous hard-on gets hard, and director Bobby Hollander scolds the cast for too much chatter and not enough obeying his commands. Herchel Savage imparts his philosophy of love to Misty Regan in between takes, not realizing his comments are captured on tape forever. A must see for hardcore fans!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mMf0SBt32TlyJK5vU0RJ9KSzkut.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
