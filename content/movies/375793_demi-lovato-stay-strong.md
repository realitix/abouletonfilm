With MTV's cameras following, she'll return for the very first time to the treatment facility she retreated to back in November 2010 to speak candidly to her recovering peers about her experiences, and to thank the counselors and staff who she says kept her alive. She'll also let the MTV audience witness first-hand her on-going evolution as an artist - as she ditches her bubble-gum Disney past and tries on a new persona as confessional singer-songwriter, and performs an album full of deeply personal material in-front of sold-out crowds for the first time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/70d3KI5BN10JnpYiI9mGbDXCl3x.jpg", "actors": ["Demi Lovato (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [481850, 253353, 196254, 13655], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
