However, the agency's owner takes a shine to her and assigns her to what seems to be a relatively straightforward case: finding a young girl who's gone missing and whose family is worried about her. As it turns out, the case involves quite a bit more than just a missing girl", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Imogen Stubbs (Anna Lee)", "Alan Howard (Mr. Hahn)", "Michael Bryant (Commander Martin Brierly)", "Barbara Leigh-Hunt (Beryl Doyle)", "Ken Stott (Bernie Schiller)", "Kate Beckinsale (Thea Hahn)", "Brian Glover (Selwyn Price)", "Shirley Anne Field (Mrs. Westerman)", "Richard Dempsey (Sam Tulloch)", "Clive Merrison (Mr. Emburey)", "Paul Guilfoyle (Dr. Frank)", "David Harewood (Stevie Johnson)", "Roger Lloyd Pack (Desk Clerk)", "Eoin McCarthy (Quex)", "Robin Soans (Dr. Stickle)", "Paul Kember (John Tulloch)", "Nicholas Hewetson (Miles)", "Tim Wylton (Mr. Westerman)", "Anthony May (Peter Knight)", "Linda Hartley (Pippa)", "Doreen Andrew (Mrs. Elder)", "Gillian Raine (Mrs. Grayle)", "Edward Jewesbury (Sam Tulloch Sr.)", "Julia St. John (Danielle Soper)", "Jack Ellis (Hospital Doctor)", "Wendy Allnutt (Mrs. Hahn)", "Jan Chappell (Mrs. Tulloch)", "Alfred Le Prevost (Soper Boy)", "Reuben Le Prevost (Soper Boy)", "Judith Coke (Hospital Nurse)", "Albert Moses (Shop Keeper)", "Jason Salkey (Screenwash Man)", "Jonathan Magnanti (Man at Party)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
