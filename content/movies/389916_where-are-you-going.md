At this point, the comedy takes a turn when the rebellious mathematician follows a strange wheel and meets a goatherd who shelters him in his humble abode. Events change from a bit odd to totally bizarre as the mathematician continues on his journey of escape.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kulbKeLVvaOhCwZZa0AFyrsZkAm.jpg", "actors": ["Stoyan Aleksiev (Prof. Radoslav Radev)", "Georgi Kaloyanchev (Bay Denyo)", "Katerina Evro (Katerina)", "Iossif Surchadzhiev (Strezov)", "Yordan Spirov (The Teacher)", "Dimo Kolarov (Simo)", "Zhivko Garvanov (Prof. Strashimirov)", "Stefan Ilyev (Dr. Alexiev)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
