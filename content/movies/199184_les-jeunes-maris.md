The husbands in question rather casually enter into marriage, never intending true fidelity to their spouses. When they realize that they're committed for life, our immature heroes return to their home town for one last fling. In the course of their final hours of bachelorhood, they come to the sobering conclusion that their carefree youth is not only past, it's already long past. Somewhat reminiscent of Fellini's I Vitelloni, Giovani Mariti boasts excellent performances from all concerned.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f3raMDetPk9eF3sv7IwUjcpDKPt.jpg", "actors": ["Antonella Lualdi (Lucia)", "Franco Interlenghi (Antonio)", "G\u00e9rard Blain (Marcello)", "Sylva Koscina (Mara Rossi Bandelli)", "Isabelle Corey (laura)", "Antonio Cifariello (Ettore)", "Raf Mattioli (Giulio)", "Ennio Girolami (Franco)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [198790, 118136, 78815, 198835], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
