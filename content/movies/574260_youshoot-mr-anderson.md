You'll see that fans can't get enough of the gimmick as they give it right back to Ken Anderson in his appearance on YOUSHOOT! Anderson has taken the oath and answers the fans as they sound off on everything from Bob Holly to his firing. Anderson isn't afraid to open up and name names when it comes to who he thinks stabbed him in the back in WWE. *cough* Cena *cough*  It's more R rated fun with an outspoken dude with heat with more people than he knew!
