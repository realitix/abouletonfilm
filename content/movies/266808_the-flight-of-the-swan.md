That is until the breakneck rhythm, intensity, stress and convolutions of career and economic success shatter him, alienating him from everyone and everything he loves: even his children and his soul mate Maria. Alexis is jolted back to reality when the unbridled greed of the multinational conglomerate his company is involved in causes an unprecedented ecological catastrophe costing many human lives. The multinational's Golden Boy suddenly realizes that he is nothing more than a cog in the machine he had fought so passionately against in his youth. He is determined to rediscover himself, to reclaim his soul, to rebuild the dream with Maria - but he is completely trapped. He is caught in a web of intrigue that tightens like a vice driving him to an inevitably lethal conflict with the conglomerate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eDKid6D5Jt3VUvIy6LFQcN06Qru.jpg", "actors": ["Alicia Witt (Maria)", "James D'Arcy (Alexis)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
