In expressive, melodic tones, the fraternal pair debate God\u2019s true message and intent for His creations, a conflict that leads their followers \u2014 in extravagantly choreographed song and dance \u2014 towards chaos and sin. Set almost entirely within a Roman amphitheater whose history lends every precise line-reading and gesture, every startling camera move and cut, a totalizing force, Straub-Huillet\u2019s adaptation of Schoenberg\u2019s unfinished opera opens us to the stimulating worldview of a filmmaking duo whose masterful efforts are finally coming to light.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4ihSmzqa9J1lEz2aV4NdaotqFa2.jpg", "actors": ["G\u00fcnter Reich (Moses)", "Louis Devos (Aron)", "Eva Csapo (Junges M\u00e4dchen)", "Roger Lucas (Junger Mann)", "Richard Salter (Anderer Mann)", "Werner Mann (Priester)", "Ladislav Ilavsky (Ephra\u00eemit)", "Elfriede Obrowsky (Kranke)", "Helmut Baumann (T\u00e4nzer)", "J\u00fcrg Burth (T\u00e4nzer)", "Nick Frarrant (T\u00e4nzer)", "Wolfgang Kegler (T\u00e4nzer)", "Michael Molnar (T\u00e4nzer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
