Standing alongside a tree-lined farmhouse, two children who are about ten and four years old toss grain to a flock of about 50 domesticated ducks. A woman watches them briefly and then moves on. The older girl has her grain in a bucket, the younger one's grain is in her apron. The children stay in one spot, as does the camera; it's the ducks that move around. Chickens are in the background; only one braves the ducks' territory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9mVgVtp7pQmTSy3bBwO46SXIAt5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [152456, 178757, 152457, 190582], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
