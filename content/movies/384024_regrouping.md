As she interviews people who know them, such as Joan Jonas, the group shoots \u2018artistic\u2019 scenes of themselves \u2013 but Borden feels they aren\u2019t fully grappling with issues of sexuality and politics. Are they a serious group \u2013 or just friends? After showing an early edit of the film to the group, its members, upset, close ranks. Undeterred, Borden incorporates the group\u2019s arguments into another edit, filming larger groups commenting both on the original one and on consciousness-raising groups in general. Uncredited voices include those of Barbara Kruger and Kathryn Bigelow.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jiy1Ataoh7WTDVC8N0AGAXbRL5p.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
