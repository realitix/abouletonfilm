There is no patronizing of the black race in this cinematic cry for justice. A fifteen-year-old boy called Duke is ambitious to buy a \"piece\" (a gun) from an adult racketeer named Priest, to become president of the gang to which he belongs, and to return them to active \"bopping\" (gang fighting) which has declined in Harlem. It is a clearly patent allegory of an attempt by Duke to attain manhood and identity in the only way accessible to him - the antisocial one.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2TVAXl7PlZJZELFaQ7YEffwlWku.jpg", "actors": ["Rony Clanton (Duke (as Hampton Clanton))", "Carl Lee (Priest)", "Yolanda Rodr\u00edguez (Luanne)", "Clarence Williams III (Blood (as Clarence Williams))", "Gary Bolling (Littleman)", "Bostic Felton (Rod)", "Joe Oliver (Angel)", "Gloria Foster (Duke's Mom)", "Ted Butler (Mom's lover)", "Antonio Fargas ()", "Marilyn Cox (Prostitute)", "The Dizzy Gillespie quintet ()", "Richard Ward (Street speaker)", "Evadney Canegata ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [97030], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
