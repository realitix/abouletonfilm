No one set out to make a film: six months after Katrina, filmmakers Elizabeth Wood and Gabriel Nussbaum moved to New Orleans with a free art program, devised to help students creatively express their thoughts in response to the chaos of the storm.

The results quickly transcended the classroom.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lIHEIiBL1O6SoZwwrY42T72qf8e.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
