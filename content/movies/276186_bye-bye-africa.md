He is shocked at the degraded state of the country and the national cinema. The filmmaker decides to make a film dedicated to his mother entitled Bye Bye Africa but immediately encounters major problems. Cinemas have closed and financing is impossible to secure. The director reunites with an old girlfriend (Yelena), who was shunned by Chadians who could not distinguish between film and reality after appearing in one of his previous films as an HIV victim. Haroun learns about the destruction of the African cinema from directors in neighboring countries, but also finds Issa Serge Coelo shooting his first film, Daressalam. Things go badly and, convinced that it is impossible to make films in Africa, Haroun departs Chad in despair, leaving his film camera to a young boy who had been assisting him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/26yrUFY30PeUo0BegnFnDguzuYU.jpg", "actors": ["Mahamat-Saleh Haroun (Haroun)", "Garba Issa (Garba)", "A\u00efcha Yelena (Isabelle)", "Abakar Mahamat-Saleh (Ali)", "Khayar Oumar Defallah (Le p\u00e8re)", "Abderamane Koulamallah (Le producteur)", "Issa Serge Coelo (Serge)", "Sophie Barrand (L'amante)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
