The band has gained major momentum in the current thirst for rootsy, soul-stirring music, and this year they\u2019re up for two Grammys for Best New Artist and Best Americana Album for their self titled debut released by Dualtone Records in Nashville.  The Lumineers have the unbeatable combination of excellent songwriting and a rousing live show, complete with an integrity and love at the heart of the band which can be traced back to the loss of drummer Jeremiah Fraites\u2019 brother, also close friend of singer/guitarist Wesley Schultz, just before the group\u2019s inception eight years ago.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qibW8jViz7JtAGWF9GJ6pYdtaXb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
