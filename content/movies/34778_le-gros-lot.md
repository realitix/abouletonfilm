The pace of the film is more in keeping with screwball comedies of the great era, but that is not to say that the film doesn't shift down a gear for poignant reflection, because it does, but ultimately the film is full of hilarity from many quarters, that is acted out accordingly from a sparky cast, and of course directed by a deity .\r\n\r\nA joyous winner that prods you in the ribs and gives a cheeky wink along the way. 9/10"}], "recommandations_id": [36497, 36495, 36498, 31996], "youtube_key": "ubmddvMZ3eQ"}
