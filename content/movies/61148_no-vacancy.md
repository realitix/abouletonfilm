She lives next to a failed violinist who won't stop playing his instrument. He lives next to a New Age fanatic who's into colonic treatments; she lives next to two drug addicts who mess with the wrong prostitutes and end up answering to a pimp named Mr. Tangerine. In a barrage of head-spinning vignettes, we are sucked into a surreal motel fantasy-land where society's riffraff dwell in that awkward place between freedom and desperation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7jWbWai39fNZrroUiJexfFRp0Xd.jpg", "actors": ["Christina Ricci (Lilian)", "Lolita Davidovich (Constance)", "Olek Krupa (Leonard)", "Timothy Olyphant (Luke)", "Joaquim de Almeida (Reynaldo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
