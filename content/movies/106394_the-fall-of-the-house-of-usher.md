Their tale is told and dimly comprehended by the unnamed narrator, a boyhood friend whom Roderick has summoned. When Madeline soon dies\u2014or seems to die\u2014they entomb her body. On a stormy night, \"cracking and ripping\" sounds and a \"shriek\" from below convince the panicky Roderick that \"We have put her living into the tomb!\" The shrouded, emaciated figure of Madeline appears at the door of Roderick's book-strewn study, falls upon him, \"and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the floor a corpse.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nREKAoxAaVCWwn1HJdT7GKumtAC.jpg", "actors": ["Herbert Stern (Roderick Usher)", "Hildegarde Watson (Madeline Usher)", "Melville Webber (A Traveller)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [190085, 175455, 195630, 147606], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
