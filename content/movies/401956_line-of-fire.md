A subsequent angiogram revealed that open heart surgery was necessary. The angiogram was filmed originally on 35mm motion picture film. Two years later, in March of 1995, his apartment burned down in the early morning hours. He was able to return to the scene the next day in order to film the aftermath. LINE OF FIRE is a blend of footage from these two episodes and explores the temporal nature of the lives we live.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qHPLu9Rug7T6uIoYbWq9qxueKEx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
