I've suffered far worse than _A Bad Moms Christmas_, to be sure, but I think it would be better if they had just left it at one movie.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}], "recommandations_id": [376659, 397422, 454992, 437557], "youtube_key": "fPLTUwxGjms"}
