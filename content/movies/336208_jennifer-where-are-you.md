The insistence of this male voice, which repeats the phrase \u201cJennifer! Where are you?\u201d every 30 seconds, parodies the authority conceded to voice-overs in the cinema. The voice is patriarchal, relentless, and runs the entire length of the film. Cut-aways to a small girl, glancing at the camera as she plays with lipstick and matches, reapportion the relation between patriarchal phonocentrism and masculine gaze. But is this small child subject to either? No. Not really. There she is, hiding in plain sight\u2013ours, not \u2018his\u2019\u2013a \u2018purloined subject\u2019 successfully evading subjugation through response or acquiescence. \u2018Jennifer,\u2019 whoever she might be (a cipher, a pseudonymous textual marker of gendered cinematic presence) is never apprehended, and the film, for all of its suspense, simply ends.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9Ft8xqhrdGU7uFU4UoPaVDLAOrF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
