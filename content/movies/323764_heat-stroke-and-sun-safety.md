This is distinct from a fever, where there is a physiological increase in the temperature set point of the body. The term \"stroke\" in \"heat stroke\" is a misnomer in that it does not involve a blockage or a hemorrhage of blood flow to the brain. Treatment involves rapid physical cooling.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sQbWdiXqKQnNdDSpTBM0IRHrIPs.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
