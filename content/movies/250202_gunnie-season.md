It is a movement, a crew, and a group of friends who all share the same passion for skiing. It is our goal to bring you a collection of images that not only give you a perspective of some of the most progressive riding to date, but also remind you just how fun skiing is. Watch as the 4BI9 crew embarks on a new adventure- one of groundbreaking feats, strange people, crazy times and epic proportions. Parks are slayed, handrails shutdown, and backcountry zones shredded until nothing remains.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bQ04xXkGPgoDrMnBTN6QWDj6LG3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
