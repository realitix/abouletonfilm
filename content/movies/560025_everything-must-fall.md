The story is told by four student leaders at Wits University and their Vice Chancellor, Adam Habib, a left-wing, former anti-apartheid student activist. When Habib\u2019s efforts to contain the protest fail, he brings 1000 police on to campus. There are dire consequences for the young leaders. By blending dramatic unfolding action with a multi-protagonist narrative, much of the drama lies in the internal struggles the activists have around the weight of leadership. Threaded through the film is a pulse of anticipation, shared across the generational divide, that somehow these youth have reached breaking point and won\u2019t back down until they achieve the kind of social transformation that previous generations had long given up on.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t9nS9S03iMH80rGWrXlt6k2GVlp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "OpGYyCLb9xQ"}
