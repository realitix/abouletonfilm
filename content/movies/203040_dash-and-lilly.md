Refusing to marry, but deeply in love, the two engaged in many affairs and battled the bottle. Dashiell served in both World wars, but in the 1950's, he was branded a Communist and cast into prison during the McCarthy witch hunts. Hellman likewise was branded a Communist, but was kept out of prison. Neither were able to work, requiring Lillian to take a job as a sales-woman in a boutique while Dashiell suffered from tuberculosis and eventually lung cancer. Bebe Neuwirth also appears as socialite-writer Dorothy Parker.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bzwbqfsacwSpb6jPhWNmWNRXwfP.jpg", "actors": ["Sam Shepard (Dashiell Hammett)", "Judy Davis (Lillian Hellman)", "Bebe Neuwirth (Dorothy Parker)", "Zeljko Ivanek (Mel Berman (writer))", "Boyd Banks (Prison Guard)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
