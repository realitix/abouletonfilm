The leader is Marty, a hyperactive boy with a natural talent for violence and destruction. One day he is bored and decides to rob a local house beside the railroad tracks. He enlists the aid of two friends and they end up holding a woman and her wheel-chair bound husband hostage while they callously destroy their home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k7DNb9h3k07wfRbPwQMgT7rYKhr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
