The tow trucks are hauling away the parked cars so the snow removal crew can get to work.  The Mighty Machines are working night and day to get the job done.  And they love every minute!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j1WtOSkFb9VdryQWzpswR0tRwj4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
