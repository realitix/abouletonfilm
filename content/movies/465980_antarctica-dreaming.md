It is the White Continent... Antarctica.  Featuring the Antarctica Peninsula, South Georgia and the Falkland Islands, Antarctica Dreaming documents all major Antarctic and sub-Antarctic animals. Their lifecycles captured over an entire season of varying climate conditions, from wild white blizzards to fire red sunsets reflected in a glassy sea.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1Azlcm5GUvbOUToNJOIXRkfbv6O.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
