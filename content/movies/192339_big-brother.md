Although they lead a simple and peaceful lifestyle, an incident occurs that changes their lives forever. The family is left with no choice but to leave Delhi and move to Mumbai in disguise. They start life afresh and all seems well until the ghosts of the past surface again.  Things reach a point when Dev Sharma is prodded by his mother to take a course of action which not only avenges their plight but also take on the cause of the aggrieved in the country as a whole.
