His incredible live performances, such as the one captured here at the Forum in Los Angeles, have made him a star across the globe, from Las Vegas to the London Palladium.  Few can equal the passion and commitment delivered by Humperdinck. The comparisons are drawn only with the very best - Elvis, Tony Bennett, Tom Jones, but Humperdinck with his distinctive style, sense of humour and genuine affection for his audience shows he is more than worthy of such rarefied status.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iRAhNZWo01pGt2Nj4kHdLKiu0eF.jpg", "actors": ["Engelbert Humperdinck ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
