Ever the underdog, and with a burning in their bellies, the Nashville Rollergirls seek to prove themselves at every turn, and nothing will prevent them from achieving the goals they set. On a quest to succeed athletically on the national stage, and to keep their skater-owned-and operated organization afloat, the Nashville Rollergirls, in true Nashville spirit, refuse to accept no, can't, or won't. And in true roller derby spirit, they bring do-it-yourself to the next level.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qoCJL64nOOZ33CEgLkvEGhdmsPR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
