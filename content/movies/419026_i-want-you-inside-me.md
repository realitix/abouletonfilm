The film is a great take on the idea of a vagina dentata, at least in a loose sense.\r\n\r\nOur protagonists first boyfriend disappears after the pair have sex in a cave. He keeps trying to call her, but something interferes with the sound. We don't really find out what happens until our protagonist moves on.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing could be looked at as a metaphor about giving in to your desires in case you'll be fully consumed."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
