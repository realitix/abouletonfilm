In an accelerating storm of cynical opportunism, her sincere beliefs are exploited by businessmen, politicians and military men. Rival groups compete to exploit the hysteria the vision causes, and the chaos culminates in a revolution. Striking imagery and skillful camerawork enhance this feature.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xsQPw3dMpyP01Z3w87PlWw3ld3Q.jpg", "actors": ["Idalia Anreus (Antonica)", "Ra\u00fal Pomares (Lino)", "Adolfo Llaurad\u00f3 (Felipe)", "Mario Balmaseda (Toni)", "Ra\u00fal Eguren  ()", "Omar Vald\u00e9s Tet\u00e9 Vergara ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
