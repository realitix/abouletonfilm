At odds with his fame and dogged by the constant near-miss of success, Marriott nonetheless played with a passion and innovation that has inspired generations. His early demise when his house caught fire was a tragedy to the music world, and his popularity has, ironically, only grown since his death. This footage documents the concert held to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Marriott's death.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mZeCjr2HzTygXOFZWXpb5kLwx6A.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Weller (Guitar and vocals)", "Noel Gallagher (Guitar and vocals)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
