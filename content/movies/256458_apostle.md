When the missionary from China, their only support route, is cut off, things begin to get very tense. Chulho, who had been arrested along with his wife, returns. After losing his wife in the interrogations, Chulho had been released and unseen for 2 years before coming back to his home, claiming that he had been commanded by God to lead the believers across the border and into South Korea. The brothers wonder if Chulho is trustworthy, and whether it is the right thing to do to leave their homeland.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6BHFNdST0NmuaofSKWW9z2yIjD7.jpg", "actors": ["Kim In-kwon (Cheolho Ju (\uc8fc\ucca0\ud638))", "Hong Kyung-in (Ujin Jang (\uc7a5\uc6b0\uc9c4))", "Choi Gyu-hwan (Hojin Yu (\uc720\ud638\uc9c4))", "Kim Jae-hwa (Bohui (\ubcf4\ud76c))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
