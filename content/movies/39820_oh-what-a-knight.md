Oswald whistles for the princess, who blows him a kiss as she appears on a balcony. He reaches her by lassoing the balcony and tying the other end of the rope to his horse's tail, using it as a tightrope. A rival knight suddenly appears and Oswald falls off the balcony, startled. He manages to climb back up and the two fight for the princess.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/47T4urII3P0OBgNviqDbv4xwmJ1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [39815, 39822, 39823, 39821], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
