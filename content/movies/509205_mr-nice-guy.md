She is closely followed by Eric, a 25-year-old man, who catches the teenager and steadies her on her feet, laughing alongside her. The happy pair met that night at a club and instantly hit it off, flirting and dancing until the wee hours of the morning. When Eric invited Amy back to his house, she eagerly accepted and now here they are. Slightly embarrassed from the wipe out, the girl looks down the darkened hallway of her hookup's place. It's filled with strange statues that catch her off guard. 'What are you ... some kind of serial killer?' she asks giggling, as Eric kisses her neck and guides her down the hall, brushing off his art collection as a hobby. He opens the door to his master and invites her inside. 'See, no statues in here, I promise!' She walks inside, and he shuts the door, his expression dropping completely.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fDETRSR0Sd0JwE2ZMKn7f4odl5.jpg", "actors": ["Abella Danger (Sexy Girl)", "Seth Gamble (Mr. Nice)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
