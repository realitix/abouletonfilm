Sita is never actually seen in the film, but her virtual presence is compellingly evoked in the moods of the forest and the elements. The film retells the epic from a feminist perspective, and is about the tragedy of power and the sacrifices that adherence to dharma demands, including abandoning a chaste wife.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wMgENNhG1SyNB7mWuaIgLOF3qdj.jpg", "actors": ["Ramdas (Rama)", "Keshav Panicker (Valmiki)", "Ravindram Nair ()", "Chinnapuliah ()", "Venkateswarlu ()", "Kondavalasa Lakshmana Rao ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
