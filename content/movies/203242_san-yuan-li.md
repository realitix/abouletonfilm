Armed with video cameras, twelve artists present a highly stylized portrait of San Yuan Li, a traditional village besieged by China's urban sprawl. China's rapid modernization literally traps the village of San Yuan Li within the surrounding skyscrapers of Guangzhou, a city of 12 million people. The villagers move to a different rhythm, thriving on subsistence farming and traditional crafts. They resourcefully reinvent their traditional lifestyle by tending rice paddies on empty city lots and raising chickens on makeshift rooftop coops.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lRV4T70elRYkmHaVd8VZ4ocQE8r.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
