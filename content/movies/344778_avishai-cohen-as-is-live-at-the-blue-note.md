His virtuosity and constant creativity in both a modern mainstream format and on funkier grooves seem effortless. As Is...Live at the Blue Note contains a CD (the first seven selections) and a DVD. \"Smash,\" \"Feediop,\" the ballad \"Remembering\" and an overlong \"Caravan\" (the one non-original) are featured in both formats while three songs are different. Cohen takes many solos and is always a prominent force in the ensembles. Pianist-keyboardist Sam Barsh and drummer Mark Guiliana communicate very well with Cohen while trumpeter Diego Urcola and tenor soprano saxophonist Jimmy Greene add plenty of fire during their guest appearances", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eW7DHEkPCliDFkoZ0TcGhtxxwJr.jpg", "actors": ["Avishai Cohen (Bass)", "Sam Barsh (Keyboards)", "Mark Guiliana (Drums)", "Diego Urcola (Trumpet)", "Jimmy Greene (Saxophones)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
