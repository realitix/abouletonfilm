This was the first film made under the BuFA (Bild- und Filmamt - Picture and Film Agency - precursor to the UFA) regime was a direct response to the British model. It was called \"Bei unseren Helden an der Somme\" and was first shown publicly in Berlin on 19 January 1917. For the first time a film was released bearing the explicit characterisation \"amtlich-milit\u00e4risch\" - or \"official military business\". Never before had a film presenting pictures of actual battle been shown in Germany - this film was advertised of doing so. And never before had a propaganda film been given a festival premiere.
