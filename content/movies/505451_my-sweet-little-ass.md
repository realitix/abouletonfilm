In 1971, he bought a house in Tangiers where he settled down a few years later, at the age of 51, for a cosy and opulent retirement. \u201cMy Sweet Little Ass\u201d is the account of his personal life, which Jean Neuenschwander clearly takes delight in recounting. He is a likeable hedonist who manages his affairs and his pleasures with considerable skill. From this somewhat comfortable existence, Simon Bischoff subtly extracts a group portrait of the homosexual subculture of Tangiers, which for some has the power of myth, particulary when frequented by characters such as Paul Bowles.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zSyrhGPEb2LkB0Qfbefa1EGoRiB.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Bowles ()", "Patricia Mynott ()", "Jean Neuenschwander ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
