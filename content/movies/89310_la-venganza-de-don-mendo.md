But he has a bad run, all played and all lost at seven-thirty (card game), and lost his honor playing in his latest escalation of love to the apartment of his beloved and beautiful Magdalena. Don Nu\u00f1o Manso de Jarama, father of Magdalena, has pledged the hand of his daughter to the Duke of Toro,  and surprises Don Mendo in the room of Magdalena. To save the honor of his beloved one, Don Mendo says that no love has led him to the Tower, but he has climbed to steal. Magdalena is clean of all suspicion, and he is condemned to die buried in the castle wall. The Marquess of Moncada and other noble gentlemen, all friends of Don Mendo, facilitate his escape.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ckxhe6ubSHP5su2IPx3JorjzgSy.jpg", "actors": ["Fernando Fern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez (Don Mendo Salazar - Marqu\u00e9s de Cabra)", "Paloma Vald\u00e9s (Magdalena)", "Juanjo Men\u00e9ndez (Don Pero Collado, Duque de Toro)", "Antonio Garisa (El Rey, Alfonso VII)", "Joaqu\u00edn Roa (Don Nu\u00f1o Manso de Jarama)", "Lina Canalejas (La Reina, Berenguela)", "Mar\u00eda Luisa Ponte (Do\u00f1a Ram\u00edrez)", "Jos\u00e9 Viv\u00f3 (Marqu\u00e9s de la Moncada)", "Paula Martel (Azofaifa)", "Lola Cardona (Marquesa de Tarrasa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [156453, 71799, 11646], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
