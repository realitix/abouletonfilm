The curse is called 'mingi' and mingi children are killed. Lale Labuko, a young educated man from the Kara tribe was 15 years old when he saw a child in his village killed and also learned that he had 2 older sisters he never knew who had been killed. He decided one day he would stop this horrific practice. Filmed over a five year period we follow Lale's journey along with the people of his tribe as they attempt to change an ancient practice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/paC67EfgPrPPMM9J6QTjhhleRrA.jpg", "actors": ["Lale Labuko (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
