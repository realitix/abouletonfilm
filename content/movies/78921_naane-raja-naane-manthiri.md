How she gets to understand him, how he reacts and how his uncle's daughter who initially adversely reacts to his tantrums reacts towards the end is the story. In short it is a triple edged love story with truth, passion and emotions galore.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/chP5Ehss6lJRKZiL3tXEZkm7w5c.jpg", "actors": ["Vijayakanth (Rangamani)", "Radhika Sarathkumar (Bhaghyalakshmi)", "Goundamani (Kupusamy)", "Senthil ()", "Jeevitha ()", "Kovai Sarala ()", "Kumarimuthu ()", "Idichapuli Selvaraj ()", "Kullamani ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
