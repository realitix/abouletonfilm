Wearing only normal uniforms, the 101st joined the other garrison troops in a siege where they fought not only the enemy's panzers but the freezing, snowy, cold to hold the vital road junction. Filmed on the ground we tell the story of the heroic defence of Bastogne.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1DZWAMw2s8X9ER6zK6iuQYrOPnL.jpg", "actors": ["Andrew Duff (Presenter)", "Steve Weiss (Presenter)", "Richard Hone (Presenter)", "Tim Saunders (Presenter)", "Tom Dormer (Presenter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "RNjoccpBMGo"}
