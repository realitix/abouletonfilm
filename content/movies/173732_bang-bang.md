The anonymous urban protagonist experiences a series of absurd situations--including a crazy cab ride, an encounter with a wacky criminal gang, and lots of gunplay--but they're stripped of any story that might explain them and infused with a unique anarchic energy, eventually suggesting our true animal nature. As with Godard, it's partly an homage to genre filmmaking (there's singing and dancing, a little sex, and lots of violence), but what really powers the film is Tonacci's inventive camera.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hmApBgcHXUXEdSXxJLIPJwD3XvW.jpg", "actors": ["Abrah\u00e3o Farc ()", "Paulo C\u00e9sar Per\u00e9io ()", "Ezequias Marques ()", "Thales Penna ()", "Milton Gontijo ()", "Jura Otero ()", "Lu\u00eds Ot\u00e1vio Madureira Horta ()", "Antonio Naddeo ()", "Jos\u00e9 Aur\u00e9lio Vieira ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
