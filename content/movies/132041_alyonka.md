Alenka Muratova (Ovodova) is a winsome 13 year old who talks Dmitry Prokovich, the chief mechanic for the Soviet, into giving up his seat in the truck to a young mother with her infant daughter. Then Alenka and Dmitry share the back of the open truck with a young woman, newly graduated dentist who has not been able to find a position, Stefan, a hitchhiker with a dog who hopes his upper-class wife will return to him and the countryside, and Vasselina Petrovolka, a woman who lost one of her twin daughters in a riding accident by the river shortly after they arrived, and now is returning to tell the other twin of her sister's fate. A warm hearted look at common folks traveling in the frontier.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dnIi4IWCOYzkYjAZmJBZ9yE8oQD.jpg", "actors": ["Natalya Ovodova (Alyonka)", "Irina Zarubina ()", "Vasiliy Shukshin ()", "Erast Garin ()", "Nikolay Kryuchkov ()", "Yevgeni Shutov ()", "Maya Menglet ()", "Natalya Seleznyova ()", "Nikolai Bogolyubov ()", "Anatoli Grachyov ()", "Ivan Zhevago ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [149468, 149467], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
