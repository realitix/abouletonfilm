Frank goes to his station in the hall and, in his anger, tells the marble statue that is a part of the furnishings of the handsome home, that his sweetheart is as cold as the stone of which it is made. He quiets down, and as he is not very busy, soon becomes drowsy, and dreams that the statue comes to life and goes with him to a ball. While they are walking along the street, a policeman meets them and questions Frank. He gets frightened, they run and as they rush back into the hall, the statue falls and breaks into a thousand pieces. His sweetheart comes down the steps and wakes him up and tells him to answer the bell. Frank's surprise at seeing the statue whole is plainly shown and his delight that is has all been a dream causes him to make up with his sweetheart.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Harry Beaumont (Frank the Butler)", "Jeanie Macpherson (Jennie the Maid)", "Viola Dana (The Statue)", "William Bechtel ()", "Carey Lee ()", "Charles Ogle ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
