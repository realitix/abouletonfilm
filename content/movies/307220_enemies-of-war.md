With aid supplied by the United States, El Salvadoran soldiers ravaged the countryside, killing 75,000 civilians -- many of them women and children.  In 1989, the horrific murder of six Jesuit priests and two women shocked the world into action.  Following the U.S. investigation into the atrocity, ENEMIES OF WAR reveals the stories of people embarking on a seemingly impossible path to peace in a country suffering from war.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Martin Sheen (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
