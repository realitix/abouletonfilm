This vibrant new production mixes live action with CGI, and is the vision of Anna Matison, an acclaimed playwright, script-writer, film director and producer. 'The Golden Cockerel' was Matison s directorial debut with the Mariinsky, and saw her also take on the roles of production and costume designer. The melodious nature, beauty and leitmotifs of the plot are underscored by the production designs; the opera uses pantomime and masquerades, while the sets utilised 3D video projections.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g8U3SNxfkLkXEQEUKhy2odM6JlK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
