K\u00f6tting provides an insight into the madness of experimentation in the extreme environment of a zero gravity flight on a Russian military base, where Gagarin\u2019s face smiles down at you from almost every building.  A wobbly B-film rocket follows a similar trajectory to the parabolic flight path, reaching for the stars before plummeting nose cone first back into the hard Earth, echoing the Russian\u2019s more brutal approach to re-entry landings than the NASA ocean splashdowns. The rocket\u2019s flight links a kaleidoscope of grainy archive images from Moscow, Star City and the parabolic flight on which Kotting participated.  The film was also commissioned by The Cornerhouse for projection on a large outdoor screen in Manchester in 2005.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
