The centerpiece of the project is four short films. The first three (\u201cMud,\u201d \u201cConcrete\u201d and \u201cGlass\u201d) draw on The New York Times's extraordinary visual archives, a repository of millions of photographs that have largely been unseen in decades. Each film is intended to evoke a chapter in a storybook, with rhyming narration and photographs brought to life with intricate animation. The fourth chapter (\u201cHome\u201d) comprises images submitted by the public. The interactive experience incorporates the films and, like a visual accordion, allows viewers to dig deeper into the project\u2019s themes with additional archival materials, text and microgames.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/crEe2jxQXfzJVs9ltTTKyxx5rEB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
