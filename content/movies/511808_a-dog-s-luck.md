Their owners teach them the choreographies of police work: biting and letting go, following and staying, always on their owner's command. Longingly gazing upwards, the dogs seem intimately connected with their owners. They are tamed and domesticated; their life is directed by humans. At the same time they are always the elusive other. A gap divides humans and animals, and from the other side these dogs see us.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nwyw6POgQHIjCSYnFtJoLcl5NfY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
