With blue eyes and vaguely foreign features, the boy is apparently the product of a mixed upbringing, and though the boy doesn't realize it, Zhang Jin He is his grandfather! Zhang Jin He initially tells the boy to go home because the boy brings him a painful reminder of his daughter, who left him to marry a foreigner. Still, others convince the aging Perking Opera master to take in the boy, and though they fight initially, the two eventually form a strong, quiet bond. But when the boy is called home, will either be willing to let go? Director Li Chen Sheng uses gorgeous cinematography and evocative locations in modern China to bring the subtle intimacy of Go Home to the screen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b8n0r1M30ZvftyufW3veOS61Y4E.jpg", "actors": ["Liu Pei-Qi ()", "Song Chunli ()", "Chen Xiaoyi ()", "Shu Fang ()", "Bai Xue ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
