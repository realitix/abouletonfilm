It is conceived as an inner pastiche which permits the message to be immediate and authentic by mosaic-like blending of motifs and time planes where it seems that the film is the only fixed point in the world because, unlike its elusive nature, it has a clear order.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x4vXvnCl1BKbBchsxsZXdjZJSx9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
