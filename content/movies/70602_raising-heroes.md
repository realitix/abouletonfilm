Susan's mother opposes gays' adopting, and Monday is the final court date. On Friday, Josh stops by a market for milk and glimpses a Mob hit. Unknown to him, the hitmen are now on his trail. Josh hates confrontation and doesn't tell Paul about the murder or call the cops. Instead, he takes Paul for an idyllic weekend in the Poconos. But Sunday, when they return to the city, the murderers are waiting. The Mob boss orders that both be killed. What chance do Paul, who's in the dark, and Josh, who's basically passive, have against this firepower? What will happen to Nickie without them?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tpOFyepJH2EFrYAuMAgFLjD7Lgd.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Zolli (Claudio)", "Greg Bodkin (Rocco Nappi)", "Nicholas Siljee (Nicki)", "Julian Safavi (Michael)", "James Pappas (Jimmy)", "Victor Barbella (Gerald)", "Chris Ferraro (Chris)", "Troy Sostillio (John Sullivan)", "Henry White (Paul McEwen)", "Edmond Sorel (Victor)", "Stewart Groves (Stephen (aka Vinny))", "Chandra Pointer (Nicole)", "Constantine Nikos (Vito)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
