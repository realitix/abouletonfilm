This is his style: over-the-top, fast, hectic, insane, gross, messy, crude, hilarious, sexy (or at least sexually themed). Also, the use of only 3 colors really sells the feel of the whole thing.\r\n\r\nThis was a submission for the JOE (Japan Animators Exhibition or the Nihon Animator Mihonichi), which is for up and coming animators/directors to show their stuff; go check it out. It's a bit lengthy (35 10-minute sketches in total) but it's worth seeing for the new talent coming out; Hiroyuki Imaishi is almost 50 and has worked with the producer of the JAE (Hideaki Anno) on multiple occasions, so I guess he had free time on his hands or maybe (and more likely) he wanted to help out the other people not listed to get their foot in the door.\r\n\r\nQuick another thing I liked, I love how they explicitly tell you what the theme of the show is a la Kill la Kill giant font on-screen style."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "6lw4yoglK-0"}
