This is where this film comes into picture, dealing with a topic that seriously matters to society: if we take into account the relatives and friends of those who have aphasia, more than 20 million people in this country are affected by it. Also, there are no major documentaries about aphasia, and yet there is an urgent need of talking about it because lack of media coverage is one of the main reasons for the shortage of funding and research. Indeed, we strongly believe that a documentary is nowadays the perfect medium to raise this issue and to help society understand it from a human point of view.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2nh9GfkKPiFWILyFxk94HokYXSR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
