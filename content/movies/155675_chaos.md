The brothers include a would-be tough guy thug, a sleazy lawyer and an anarchist. The anarchist and the sister (Maria Strzelecka) have a thing for each other that is more than just sibling affection. Each of them is facing a problem of their own making. A lot depends on how they deal with their issues, as there isn't much lower they can stoop other than being dead. In the beginning of the film there is a lot going on, which makes it a little hard to follow, but that goes along with the theme of chaos.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aI41bUeBMjXbV6PZLbFJsIu6nDO.jpg", "actors": ["Magdalena Cielecka (Hanna von Bronheim)", "Borys Szyc (\u0141ysy)", "Maria Strzelecka (Mania)", "Pawe\u0142 Wilczak (Er)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ie1yIDJ3hLA"}
