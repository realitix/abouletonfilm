(N.B. proper prints and a negative do exist, just not in Lampert's possession!) With dubious methods used to achieve authenticity, El Adios Largos is at once an uncanny aesthetic experience and a playful exploration of the philosophical conundrums involved for those working to preserve film history for generations to come.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xNN4kCjiYJc9ckS41dR72mcd4PW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
