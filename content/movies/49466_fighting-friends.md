It is the simple story of two friends who live together in a poor tenement and who share about everything in life (food, hopes, work...). Everything goes well until they gallantly rescue a young (and pretty) woman injured in a road accident. Since the lady has nowhere to go, the two good-hearted friends invite her to their home. She soon becomes their housemaid and they soon begin to seek her favors. Alas, she falls for a young student she has met in the neighborhood, much to the two friends' dismay.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4dVlSADNRpNb2tpvtznfP8iINfv.jpg", "actors": ["Atsushi Watanabe (Ryukichi)", "Hisao Yoshitani (Yoshizo)", "Eiko Takamatsu (Ogen)", "Ichiro Yuki (Okamura)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
