You'll work through several challenging, flowing sequences and then enter into dynamic stillness through standing balance poses, deep stretching and focused breathing. In the second and longer format, you'll take your asana and energetic practice to new levels by exploring the two primary yogic locks that retain your prana while increasing core stability. You'll also cleanse your body and clear your mind through breathing techniques and deepen your experience in increasingly complex poses through an introduction to rich philosophical teachings of the yamas and niyamas.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Katie Pearson (Instructor)", "Kristin Mabry (Instructor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
