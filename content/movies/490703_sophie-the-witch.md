The old book like the one about witches and monsters in her hands suddenly springs to life. Out from it escape Sophie the Witch and her companions: Black Claw, Gray Nightmare and the Red Straw Monster, as well as the water-sprite Aquiline, the shy little dwarf Tiny Peat, and the enchantress Lady Spider. They scatter among the town and woods and performed all kinds of mischief. Sophie just can't get her broom to fly, because she became too fat. The monsters, disappointed over the century in which we live, return back into the book, the witch Sophie loses her magic power and becomes 'Aunt Sophie', and Tiny Peat has changed into a black cat.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f0vlcc9oJ0TIx6x4Pb5CDj7xf2Z.jpg", "actors": ["Ljerka Belak (Crni Krempelj (voice))", "Vlado Kreslin (Zeleni Akvilin (voice))", "Svetlana Makarovi\u010d (Coprnica Zofka / Metla (voice))", "Stole Aran\u0111elovi\u0107 ((voice))", "Janez Bon\u010dina ((voice))", "Karel Brisnik ((voice))", "Janez Ho\u010devar ((voice))", "Ivanka Me\u017ean ((voice))", "Petra Poga\u010dnik ((voice))", "Pavle Rakovec ((voice))", "Nace Simon\u010di\u010d ((voice))", "Alja Tka\u010deva ((voice))", "Alenka Vidrih ((voice))", "Bo\u017eo Vovk ((voice))", "Tanja Zgonc ((voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
