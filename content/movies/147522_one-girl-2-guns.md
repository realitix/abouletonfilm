Money runners and assassins for a powerful drug lord, they know way too much to just wash their hands and walk away from all the violence, death and destruction.  But when Rachel is brutally murdered in a drug deal gone bad, June calls it quits and takes to the open road for survival. Escape isn't that easy, and her life becomes a living hell as she is sadistically \"persuaded\" by the FBI into setting up her ex-boss. Forced back into the game, yet driven by a righteous code of honor and a killer's instinct, June finds herself at the dead end of a one-way street ... from which the only way out is with both guns blazing!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
