With increasing frequency, their son Manni becomes the focus of their arguments. Since the two cannot agree to a compromise, they decide to break up. The ten-year-old Manni is supposed to spend four weeks with Monika followed by four weeks with Johannes on an alternating basis. They want to prove to each other who has the better parenting skills. The plan fails, however, because Manni is very good at playing his parents off against each other. When Monika and Johannes finally see through their son\u2019s game, they realize that their way of life does not lead to better parenting and they conclude that good parenting can only be achieved if they work together.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4bOBCiLdlsUfU03Mm1DWJ6ydGLV.jpg", "actors": ["Dieter Wien (Johannes Koch)", "Monika Gabriel (Monika Koch)", "Martin Grunert (Manni)", "Gerhard Bienert (Opa Koch)", "Reiner Sch\u00f6ne (K\u00f6rner)", "Brigitte Krause (Lehrerin Hellwig)", "Paul Arenkens (Tenor)", "Angelika Waller ()", "Martin Hellberg ()", "Werner Kamenik ()", "Friedrich Teitge ()", "Werner Lierck ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
