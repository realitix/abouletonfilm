The scenery of the Looe branch with the interesting reversal and climb fromCoombe Junction, the freight-only branch to Fowey, running alongside the picturesque river, the meandering Newquay branch, the Falmouth branch still with its original main line infrastructure and finally the classic coastal railway over golden sands to picture postcard St.Ives.  This is now a virtual archive as all the motive power is first generation DMUs on the passenger branches (single and two car) and a Class 37 loco on the Fowey branch.
