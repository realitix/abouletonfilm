She then turns hot, marries a rich dude and becomes a much-lusted-after feather dancer. With a special dagger she kills her hubby for his loot but then his brother becomes involved and ends up on trial for murder himself. Can he and his lawyer convince the jury supernatural events were in play? Footage from this later became the backbone for the crazy exploitation horror flick Terror, Sex and Witchcraft (1984).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pJWYDBdWsVoqlXoUaG6sZhxBlo6.jpg", "actors": ["Ana Luisa Peluffo (Vicki)", "Gonzalo Aiza (Ricardo Santamaria / Carlos Santamaria)", "David Reynoso (Detective M\u00e9ndez)", "Beatriz Aguirre (Se\u00f1ora Santamar\u00eda)", "Roberto Ca\u00f1edo (Psychiatrist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
