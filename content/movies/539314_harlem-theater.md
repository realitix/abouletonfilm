New Lafayette (or NLT) had been founded by actor-director Robert Macbeth the previous year, with the aim of producing theater for black people, by black people, to reflect the experiences and vernacular of the Harlem community. Within the Black Arts Movement, NLT would become a significant institution: it published the journal Black Theatre, and employed a host of talents \u2013 including the Black Panthers\u2019 Minister of Culture, Ed Bullins, and the great pianist Junior Mance, both of whom appear in Wildenhahn\u2019s film as resident collaborators.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
