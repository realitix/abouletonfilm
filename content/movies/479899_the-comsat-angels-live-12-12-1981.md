They were initially active from 1978 to 1995 with basically this line-up. Named after the J. G. Ballard short story. They debuted in 1979 with the \"Red Planet\" three-track single. This release attracted Polydor A&R man Frank Neilson and the band signed a three-album recording contract. These three albums - \"Waiting for a Miracle\" (1980), which included the single \"Independence Day\", probably their best known song, \"Sleep No More\" (1981) and \"Fiction\" (1982) - are regarded by some as their best, but only sold modestly.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pyArsZVNlLzFhWTrdofCiLogcYs.jpg", "actors": ["Stephen Fellows (Himself - Vocals, Guitar)", "Mik Glaisher (Himself - Drums)", "Kevin Bacon (Himself - Bass)", "Andy Peake (Himself - Keyboards)", "The Comsat Angels ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
