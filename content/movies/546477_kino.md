For a long time, huge portions of these territories went unexplored. In this historical drama set in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Padre Kino (1645-1711), a Jesuit missionary, defies his superiors and explores the northern reaches of Baja California. In his journeys, he discovers (to everyone's surprise) that it is a penninsula connected to the rest of California. Padre Kino (Francisco Eusebio Kino) established many towns and villages along the way, and is an important figure in Mexico's colonial history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/idoj2xl4u0pgi70bGY5qrZSIlF8.jpg", "actors": ["Enrique Rocha (Padre Kino)", "Rodolfo de Anda (Almirante Isidro de Atondo)", "Manuel Ojeda (Jefe Coro)", "Fernando Balzaretti (Teniente Manje)", "Carlos Card\u00e1n (Teniente Rincon)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
