With a blistering combination of punk and funk they demolished the walls of genre and challenged the racial stereotypes and the political order of the music industry and of the nation. EVERYDAY SUNSHINE is about music, history, fear, courage and funking on the one.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4uqOUjEYXYWqfKRr3CmNXqVVwNE.jpg", "actors": ["Norwood Fisher (himself)", "Angelo Moore (himself)", "Ice-T (himself)", "Flea (himself)", "Gwen Stefani (herself)", "Branford Marsalis (himself)", "Eugene Hutz (Himself)", "George Clinton (himself)", "Les Claypool (Himself)", "Tim Robbins (Himself)", "Mike Watt (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
