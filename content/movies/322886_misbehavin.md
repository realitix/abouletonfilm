Lesllie Bovee gives one of her most lovable performances as Rita Lawrence, a serial bride and divorc\u00e9e introduced throwing a party for her most recent divorce, lucky number thirteen. Watching the proceedings are an angel and a devil, who make a wager over whether lovely Rita\u2019s next marriage will be for love or money. As Rita prowls for her next marital conquest, assisted by her wisecracking gal-pal Gloria Leonard, she must not only juggle three potential suitors, but avoid being assassinated by her vengeful ex-mother-in-law (Vincent-regular Molly Malone at her best, channeling Rosalind Russell).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nuhaBKQGePGX4CwmCJVSspNnbPj.jpg", "actors": ["Lesllie Bovee ()", "Gloria Leonard (Gloria)", "Arcadia ()", "Marc Valentine ()", "Sonny Landham ()", "Molly Malone (Agatha)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
