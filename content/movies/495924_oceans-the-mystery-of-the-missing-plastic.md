In this investigation, scientists embark in search of the micro-plastics. Small, mostly invisible, toxic, they are home to the new ecosystem:  the plastisphere. But where are they? Ingested by organisms? Buried under the ocean floor? Degraded by bacteria? And what is the impact of them entering the food chain?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rqCOf4YDqXQQeFMvpFy1pi2juHj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "dUWivlFCLHQ"}
