It tackles issues of identity, displacement, the spectre of comparison, 2nd class citizenship, nationality and the privileged position of belonging in the academe, all disguised in the everyday struggles of sustaining a long distance relationship. Seen from the point of view of the one who writes to a lover left behind, (Mahal, 2017) serves as a reference to the daily battles of a scholar who is burdened with the choice of reconciling the need to find solutions to the social problems of her country and the desire to live a reactionary life with the person she loves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c0cw11vQasqMqxcy30yTStbvRtd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
