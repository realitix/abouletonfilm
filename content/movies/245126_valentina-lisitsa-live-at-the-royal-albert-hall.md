It is difficult to remember the last time any concert gave me so much pleasure and insight, and sent my soul soaring to such heights of joy. So many beloved piano pieces, so magnificently performed! Valentina has scaled the heights of technique, knocking off 'impossible' Liszt pieces like a stroll in the park. She melds with the piano with such assured ease that she can milk every piece for musical content and subtlety, reminding us of the great Hoffman, who also loved to play each piece a little differently every time, tapping deeply into the inexhaustible potential of a great composition, perpetually finding fresh ideas and magnificent new interpretations.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Valentina Lisitsa (Valentina Lisitsa)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "tmdb30957237", "content": "By Carl Armstrong\r\nValentina Lisitsa filmed live at the Royal Albert Hall on June 19, 2012 marks her debut on the Decca label.Playing for over 2 hours on her Bosendorfer piano.\r\n\r\nThe program consists of the following pieces:Liszt Hungarian Rhapsody #12, Liszt Totentanz, Liszt/Schubert \"Ave Maria\", Liszt/Paganini Etude \"La Campanella\",3 more Liszt/Schubert transcriptions including \"Erlkonig, 3 Chopin Nocturnes in C minor, D flat major,and E flat major, Scriabin 2 Poems opus 32, and 2 Etudes opus 42 #3 & opus 65 #1, Beethoven \"Moonlight\" Sonata, Rachmaninoff Etude Tableaux in A minor opus 39 # 6, Rachmaninoff 4 preludes opus 32 #5, #10, #12, opus 23 #5, Mozart Fantasia in C minor K 475.\r\n\r\nRecorded in Dolby Digital Stereo Surround Sound and beautifully photographed, with lots of closups of her hands, students as well as connoisseurs of great piano playing will be overwhelmed be her dynamic style, countless expressive insights, and transcendental virtuosity that is always at the service of the composer.
