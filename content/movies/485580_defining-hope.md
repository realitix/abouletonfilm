We have ventilators, dialysis machines, ICUs-technologies that can \"fix\" us and keep our bodies alive-which have radically changed how we make medical decisions. In our death-denying culture, no matter how sick we get, there is always \"hope.\" Defining Hope tells the story of patients dealing with life-threatening illness as they move between ICUs, operating rooms, hospice care and home. Diane is a nurse caring for end-stage cancer patients when she is diagnosed with ovarian cancer herself. 23-year-old Alena undergoes a risky brain surgery that destroys her short-term memory. 95-year-old Berthold lives with his elderly wife who struggles to honor his wish of dying peacefully at home. Defining Hope follows these patients and others- and the nurses that guide them along the way- as they face death, embrace hope, and ultimately redefine what makes life worth living.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9jXIYK5eHyiNj4iEEu2E2elmh7F.jpg", "actors": ["Rudolph Bilotti Sr. (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
