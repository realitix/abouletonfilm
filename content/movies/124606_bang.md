She snaps, grabs his gun, takes his uniform, and leaves him cuffed to a tree where he's soon having a defenseless chat with a homeless man. She takes off on the cop's motorcycle and, for an afternoon, experiences a cop's life. She talks a young man out of suicide and then is plunged into violence after a friendly encounter with two \"vatos.\" She is torn between self-protection and others' expectations. Is there any resolution for her torrent of feelings?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xqWEBDhXjnJJ3NzrvMjzEzePcu.jpg", "actors": ["Darling Narita (The Girl)", "Peter Greene (Adam)", "Michael Newland (Officer Rattler)", "Erik Schrody (Pimp)", "Michael Artura (Officer Trotter)", "James Sharpe (Officer Ham)", "Luis Guizar (Jes\u00fas)", "Art Cruz (Juan)", "David Alan Graf (The Producer)", "Stanley B.
