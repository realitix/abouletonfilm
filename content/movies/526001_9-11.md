As the tragedy unfolds, Tony Oursler records from his apartment, just blocks from the former World Trade Center, and on the ground in Lower Manhattan. Oursler began recording after the first building was struck, and continued to record as the second tower was hit. His camera also captures the responses of New Yorkers and tourists at the site in the days that follow. 9/11 allows the viewer a highly personal and immediate perspective on the events as they occur.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
