{"tmdb_id": 388601, "title": "Flight To Berlin", "original_title": "Flight To Berlin", "slug_title": "flight-to-berlin", "date": "1984-03-18", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "In this enigmatic thriller, Susannah (Tusse Silberg) is suddenly herded out of an apartment in the middle of the night and brought to a police station for extensive questioning about why she was in a place that belonged to a known criminal. What the police do not know is that Susannah has been somehow involved in the death of a woman and has reunited with her sister Julie (Lisa Kreuzer) in Berlin. Julie herself has some rather unusual friends -- including Eddie Constantine the American-born French actor and singer who plays himself. It is these characters and their dialogue and asides, and even background action and scenery, that form the real body of this specialized film -- not the plot. For these reasons, this type of film is best limited to those who are more interested in avant-garde than in commercial cinema.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/40WbsBTJ8CMBMrOAfXvFYxM4DyO.jpg", "actors": ["Tusse Silberg (Susannah)", "Paul Freeman (Nicholas)", "Lisa Kreuzer (Julie)", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois St\u00e9venin (Edouard)", "Ewan Stewart (Jack)", "Eddie Constantine (Eddie)", "Tatjana Blacher (Carlotta)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
