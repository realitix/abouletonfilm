Then he enters the priesthood and trains himself a mountaineering asceticism. When he becomes an eminent young priest, the last trial to receive the mantle of the preceding abbot applies on him. The old monk sends the fairest of the fair, Myo-Hyang of cottage Ni Am to Chim-Ae to form a connection with her. But Chim-Ae quickly removes his earthly desires towards woman and goes through this hardship by fasting meditation. However the old monk recognizes that love sprouted between two youngsters and shows Chim-Ae the face of transgression which he mentally violated without hesitation to make Chim-Ae and Myo-Hyang go back to mundane existence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lrHf9NozGsK4iX0w5WSoqgbCb3y.jpg", "actors": ["Choi Bool-am ()", "Byeong-ho Park ()", "Jo Jae-seong ()", "Ye-jin Lim ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
