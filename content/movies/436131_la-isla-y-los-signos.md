The cartographer Samuel Feij\u00f3o decided to discover the mythical island and for this reason he settled in the middle of the country and regularly published a travel book that looked like a magazine, narrating his own travels through the mythological universe of folk culture. Twenty four years later, a young man wishes to redraw the trip following the trail left by Feij\u00f3o in \"Signos\", in such a manner that the trip through the magazine displays on the screen the mythical world of Feij\u00f3o, his life and his inclusion in folk culture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8Evpyv9MMw9YQB3V72ILdfINLYV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
