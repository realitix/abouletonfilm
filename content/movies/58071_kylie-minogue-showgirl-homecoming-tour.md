Minogue was originally scheduled to perform in Australia and Asia during Showgirl: The Greatest Hits Tour in 2005, but she was forced to cancel the tour when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Minogue resumed the tour on 11 November 2006, performing at the Sydney Entertainment Centre, with a new set list and costumes. The dance routines from Showgirl - The Homecoming Tour were reworked to accommodate her medical condition and longer breaks were also introduced between sections of the show to conserve her strength.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a61U5ys4nD6VdbDsv5iigwvFo6.jpg", "actors": ["Kylie Minogue (Herself)", "Valerie Etienne (Backing Vocals)", "Hazel Fernandez (Backing Vocals)", "Janet Ramus (Backing Vocals)", "Annoulka Yanminchev (Dance Captain)", "Jason Beitel (Dancer)", "Marco Da Silva (Dancer)", "Jamie Karitzis (Dancer)", "Alan Lambie (Dancer)", "Welly Locoh-Donou (Dancer)", "Claire Meehan (Dancer)", "Jason Piper (Dancer)", "Nikoletta Rafaelisova (Dancer)", "Andile Sotiya (Dancer)", "Nikki Trow (Dancer)", "Rachel Yau (Dancer)", "Terry Kvasnik (Acrobat)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
