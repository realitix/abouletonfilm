Based upon the logic of \"winning-and-losing\", these soul-searchings are directed towards their loved ones, towards life in general but, most importantly, towards themselves. Needless to say, as usual, it is a woman who suffers most within these patriarchal soul-searchings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pm6KCbRfyxQpxROS4MX1IEnsFi2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
