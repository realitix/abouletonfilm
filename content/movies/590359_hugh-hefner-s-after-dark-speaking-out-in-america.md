Expanding on Hefner's influence not only as a celebrity figure but as a catalyst for social awareness, discussion and change, Berman continues to break new ground in Playboy: After Dark, Speaking Out in America. In this doc, Berman details the run and lasting influence of Hefner's two short-lived television shows Playboy: After Dark (1969-1970) and Playboy's Penthouse (1959-1960). Part entertainment segments, part talkshows, the programs featured numerous celebrity guests and covered a diverse range of subjects during their respective runs, including race, integration, environmental changes and free speech. With the story told through interviews and a collection of archived footage, this documentary makes it clear how and why both programs deserve their spots in television history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rW875tBV26g1vJKm04GwB4tbIrS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
