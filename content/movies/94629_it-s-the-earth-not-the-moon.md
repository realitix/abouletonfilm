Right in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, Corvo is a large rock, 6km high and 4km long, with the crater of a volcano and a single tiny village of 440 people. Gradually, this small filming crew is accepted by the island\u2019s population as its new inhabitants, two people to add to a civilization almost 500 years old, whose history is hardly discernible, such is the lack of records and written memories. Shot at a vertiginous pace throughout a few years, self\u2010produced between arrivals, departures and coming\u2010backs, \u201cIt\u2019s the Earth not the Moon\u201d develops as the logbook of a ship, and turns out as a patchwork of discoveries and experiences, which follow the contemporary life of a civilization isolated in the middle of the sea. A long atlantic film\u2010odissey, divided in 14 chapters, that combines anthropological records, literature, lost archives, mythological and autobiographical stories.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lqFa9oONw9Im2Pud3U9p6dyRz8p.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
