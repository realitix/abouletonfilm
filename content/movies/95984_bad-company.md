Sadatomo is at a secondary school in a small town. His parents barely take any notice of him. The strict teacher Kobayashi has hung up a 'humanity index' in the classroom, divided into the categories 'delinquents', 'scum' and 'people'. In each category he has hung name-cards of pupils. One day Kobayashi finds out that Sadatomo and his friends have stolen some things from a shop for fun. Their fathers are informed and as punishment, the children have to write a 'self-critical' essay of no less than thirty pages. For the first time, Sadatomo is beaten by his father. Shocked, he writes a piece entitled 'I am an onion', in which the teacher thinks he can detect a first sign of humanity. That is the start of a confusing situation in which it gets hard to distinguish lies, truth, justified self-criticism and opportunist wheeler dealing, even for the boys.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v32j2qIDGr1ofJ5KUT5h6HSGggp.jpg", "actors": ["Yamato Okitsu (K\u00f4zu, Sadatomo)", "Ryosuke Takahashi (Nimura, Tetsuya)", "Yuta Nakajima (Nomura, Shuji)", "Ken Mitsuishi (K\u00f4zu, Yoshiyuki (Sadatomo's Father))", "Mikio Shimizu (Professor Kobayashi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "1Jm61KfVa-g"}
