Perhaps the most familiar, H. A. Rey's Curious George Rides a Bike, is a freewheeling misadventure involving a new bicycle, paper boats, a circus, a trumpet-swallowing ostrich, and a runaway bear. Margaret Mahy's The Great White Man-Eating Shark is a playful story about Norvin, a boy whose shark-like features allow him to scare away unwanted swimmers. Patricia McKissack narrates her book Flossie and the Fox, in which a clever young African-American girl visits her neighbor with a basket of eggs and outfoxes a fox.  This DVD contains three bonus stories, Louise Fatio's The Happy Lion, Michael Foreman's The Cat and Canary, and a Spanish-language version of Curious George Rides a Bike.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vqnzE7kiyXvAu60MpjRwjaIjqL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
