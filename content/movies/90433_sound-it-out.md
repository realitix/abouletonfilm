SOUND IT OUT is a documentary portrait of the very last surviving vinyl record shop in Teesside, North East England.  A cultural haven in one of the most deprived areas in the UK, SOUND IT OUT documents a place that is thriving against the odds and the local community that keeps it alive. Directed by Jeanie Finlay who grew up three miles from the shop.  A distinctive, funny and intimate film about men, the North and the irreplaceable role music plays in our lives.  High Fidelity with a Northern Accent.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xaUa4HYsSsFGlas8YctOWhwJwm0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "rWo56xSJf0w"}
