He despairs of her ridiculous affectations, social-climbing aspirations and constant embarrassing attempts in company to show herself as an elegant, cultured sophisticate. He feels trapped in a relationship where, as he observes, a wife \"does nothing to entitle her husband to divorce her, but a thousand things that entitle him to murder her\".", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Tom Walls (Geoffrey Lymes)", "Yvonne Arnaud (Elma Melton)", "Cathleen Nesbitt (Anne Lymes)", "Athole Stewart (Ernest Melton)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
