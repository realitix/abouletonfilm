I was worried that he was going to come across with a stereotyped Groucho impression, the kind you might see Bugs Bunny do, or even Alan Alda's (or, rather, Hawkeye Pierce's) impersonation on M*A*S*H*. You know who they're parodying, but it's not really Groucho. Ferrante, however, captures so many of Groucho's mannerisms and speech habits, from subtle eye rolls to sly grins at the audience, that you soon forget you're watching an impersonation. It's a masterful performance."}], "recommandations_id": []}
