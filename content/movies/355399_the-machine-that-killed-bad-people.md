It also addresses the role of electronic media in the struggle for power, and more broadly, American intervention in the Third World.  Using a structure that emulates the way television news programs construct meaning through fragmentation, the tape interweaves clips of Filipino activists and reporters, a fictional television anchorwoman and correspondent, commentary by independent filmmaker Trinh T. Minh-ha, Fagin's off-camera voice and script, and anonymous excerpts from commercial television.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4BZxiT9HFiaqL7rDxXIKDaTt203.jpg", "actors": ["Steve Fagin ()", "Trinh T.
