The \"big guns\" are a misfit duo of ethically questionable characters who must infiltrate a gay nightclub and \"fit in\" while they search for clues. What ensues is both hilarious and action-packed.  Oboreru Sakana is a rather ambitious and often hilarious contemporary crime thriller. Its narrative swings from the grisly to the humorous and pulls in as many pop culture elements as it can manage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qcl0hhng9UJ7ExbFgVWoHr4e7Rm.jpg", "actors": ["Kippei Shiina (Katsuhiko Shirosu)", "Yosuke Kubozuka (Munetaka Akiyoshi)", "Yukie Nakama (Maki Aikawa)", "Nobuyuki Katsube (Shibusawa)", "Hiroki Narimiya (Hotaro)", "Sayuri Oyamada ()", "Kojiro Matsumoto ()", "Inuko Inuyama (Ami)", "Sabu Kawahara (Ogata)", "Shuzo Mitamura (Takehashi)", "Pepe Hozumi (Shimada)", "Denden ()", "Hakuryu ()", "Masat\u014d Ibu (Shuji Ishimaki)", "Shinobu Kawamata ()", "Kazuki Maehara ()", "Yoko Nogiwa ()", "J\u00f4 Shishido (Ace no Jo)", "Megumi Ujiie ()", "Ken Watanabe (Miyota)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
