But after bearing with it for a while it become apparent this is a well put together film. \r\n\r\nYou have to be a fan of off beat cult horror to appreciate the underlying cheesy but tones of craziness that must have been going through the writers mind, but if you like a good twisted horror this one is certainly not to be missed. \r\n\r\nIts a bit twisted and there are some good gory bits, but the biggest horror is what you don't see, but what you experience the young character going through as he battles in his mind between his love of horror and the love of his brother. \r\n\r\nCertainly one not to miss."}], "recommandations_id": [326415, 138943, 123359, 256742]}
