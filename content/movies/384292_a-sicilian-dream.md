Dreamt up by the younger son of a Sicilian dynasty, Vincenzo Florio, the Targa Florio ran until 1977 and was simultaneously considered as both totally insane and an absolute \u2018must do\u2019 by drivers and manufacturers alike.  A Sicilian Dream is a theatrical documentary that journeys into the very heart of this story, exploring its many intrigues and revelations. Our journey is led by one of Italy\u2019s most preeminent dreamers: Francesco da Mosto, star of several BBC series, the well-known Venetian architect, historian and incurable romantic and Alain de Cadenet, a Renaissance Man and a racing driver who nearly died in the race.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jFMvXlHUDPcHxILE01myPYjbpkD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
