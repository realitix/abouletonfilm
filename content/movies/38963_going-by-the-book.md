Though surprised and annoyed by the unexpected fine, the police chief has bigger problems; the town of Sampo has been hit by a string of bank robberies, and to reassure the public he decides to carry out a realistic drill which will demonstrate the police force's capability. Do-man is chosen to act out the part of the bank robber, but with his usual fastidious attention to detail he sets out to commit the perfect crime.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5t2GdaUTh9maP2sOnaF6r845w54.jpg", "actors": ["Lee Young-eun (Jeon Da-hye)", "Jung Jae-young (Jeong Do-man)", "Son Byung-ho (Lee Seung-Woo)", "Uhm Soo-jung (Han So-Young)", "Shin Goo (Do-Man's father)", "Im Ji-eun (Kim Sung-mi)", "Ko Chang-seok (Woo Jong-Dae)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [75006, 71620, 32213, 82477], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
