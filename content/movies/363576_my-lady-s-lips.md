Schulberg for his own independent production company. Powell, who welcomed the chance to play a sympathetic character after being typecast in villainous roles, plays star newspaper reporter Scott Seddon. Seddon is hired by the paper's editor to infiltrate a gambling ring that is trying to blackmail his daughter, Lola (Clara Bow). While Lola falls for Seddon, he in turn falls for Rita (Alyce Mills), a gang member toughened by the hard knocks of her early childhood.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/72BtdYrd2iv3wcFgsslbuwlnKQp.jpg", "actors": ["Alyce Mills ()", "Clara Bow ()", "William Powell ()", "John St. Polis ()", "Ford Sterling ()", "S\u00f4jin Kamiyama ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
