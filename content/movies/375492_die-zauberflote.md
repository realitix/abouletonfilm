Papageno the bird-catcher arrives and claims he killed the serpent, but the outraged Ladies padlock Papageno's mouth for his lie. They also show Tamino a portrait of Princess Pamina, the Queen's kidnapped daughter, and he immediately falls in love. Protected by a golden flute, he sets off with the bird-catcher Papageno to rescue Pamina from the clutches of the sorcerer Sarastro and a madcap adventure involving magicians, wild animals and very Masonic-like trials. Triumphing over all adversity, the lovers unite, as the forces of light banish the darkness and Papageno even finds a true love of his own.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Felicity Lott (Pamina)", "Leo Goeke (Tamino)", "Thomas Thomaschke (Sarastro)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
