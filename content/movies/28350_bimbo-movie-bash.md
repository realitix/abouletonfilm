It is laughably cheap. The only things added are some subtitles, dubing, and music. Made up from such fine films as \"Assault of the Killer Bimbos\". They are stringed together to form a \"plot\" about aliens. Lots of pointless nudity, but it is somewhat well-paced. Stay for the final credits, which the narrator narrates.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zCJFIbaPllXv2ys2YjZDw0zkXvf.jpg", "actors": ["Ian Abercrombie (Dr. Dorn)", "Adrienne Barbeau (Dr. Kurtz)", "Michelle Bauer (Amanda)", "Roxanne Blaze (Xena)", "Sara Suzanne Brown (Rena)", "Troy Donahue (Dr. Ackerman (archive footage))", "Joe Estevez (Joe (archive footage))", "Morgan Fairchild (Camella Swales)", "Bill Maher (Jim (archive footage))", "Elizabeth Kaitan (Lulu)", "Linnea Quigley (Sally / Spider)", "Brinke Stevens (Shala / Taffy)", "Julie Strain (Illyana)", "Shannon Tweed (Margo)", "Karen M.
