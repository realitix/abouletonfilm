Around them, there is a net of family members, friends, and acquaintances who seem to swirl around the banking brothers. Frederic and Bruno are both trying to control the future of their beautiful niece, Vanessa. The coffee shop owners Eve and Jim complicate everybody's life with their intrigues and lies. A strange stage director comes from his foreign exile. And lack of funds suddenly reveals the true colors of everyone - in banking, on stage, and everywhere.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xDqYszrE6N5WqKeIs3WBATIoPCF.jpg", "actors": ["Jean-Christophe Bouvet (Bruno Saltim)", "Jean-Marc Barr (Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Saltim)", "Jeanne Balibar (Vanessa Bartholomioux)", "Mich\u00e8le Moretti (Florence)", "Pascal Cervo (F\u00e9lix)", "Marilyne Canto (Eve La Rochelle)", "Laurent Cygler (Jim La Rochelle)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
