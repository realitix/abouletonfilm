More frightful than Jason! Deadlier than a psycho! It's Mileek and Chuckie's illegitimate daughter, Shameeka!  For some, the 1st and 15th of each month means a payday, but for those living in 'Da Hood' it's a day to fear as Mileek stalks the streets looking for unsuspecting victims to murder. He then hangs the tennis shoes of his sacrificial lambs from a power line.  Enter Mike and Laura, a lost young couple who are trying to find their way back to their suburban dwelling. Mileek sees the couple as easy prey, but once they escape, Mileek decides to enlist the help of Shameeka - a killer in her own right who seeks vengeance against the men in the hood who refuse to pay child support.  As the unlikely couples battle it out, all of the villainous clich\u00e9s of films past pop up in hilarious satires of the most classic horror moments of all time!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dBG5biH8CCukQyi4v8sAT2NYR4F.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
