The plot is the old saw about a crooked lawyer who gains control of a valuable estate with forged documents. The villain not only kicks the tenant farmers off the property, but he even forecloses on a church (Boo! Hiss!) Coming to the rescue is peasant hero Silvio (Alberto Gomez) and aristocratic heroine Rosaura (Alda Luz), who expose the bad guy as a phony and restore the church to its former spiritual splendor. As the first 1939 Argentine release, De la Sierre al Valle got the season off to a good start.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
