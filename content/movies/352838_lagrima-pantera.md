It consists of a fragmentary experience of freedom, in super-8 and 16mm, in a code out of time, out of the square, while recreating (with different cameras) the wild and sensitive look that Oiticica dedicated to cinema.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h4MULGOWuLpMvj7QYDolNzdDjae.jpg", "actors": ["H\u00e9lio Oiticica ()", "Cildo Meireles ()", "J\u00falio Bressane ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
