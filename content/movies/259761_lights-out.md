He took a singular premise, fear of the dark, and created a grueling three minutes of tension without a single line of dialogue.\r\n\r\nThere isn't much to say about a film that only lasts three minutes other than my heart was pumping for almost all of it.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of this film is its duration. We have no time to find anything out, but that's okay. The movie is about being afraid of what runs around with the lights off. We don't have to know the history of the creature, nor do we need to know a thing about the victim.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those movies that could give your child nightmares for weeks before you even knew they were watching it."}], "recommandations_id": [305967, 381419, 381294, 390557], "youtube_key": "FUQhNGEu2KA"}
