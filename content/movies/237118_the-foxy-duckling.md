The fox uses a decoy and duck call, and is blasted by hunters' rifles. He builds a series of wooden extensions from a tree branch in an effort to reach the airborne duck, but the duck drops a feather onto the fox's head, and the extensions beneath the fox collapse, with the fox plunging mortally to ground. His spirit, while ascending to Heaven, encounters and chases the duck.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gVUM5mUtCbjpMGojEdtCJ1c5pMk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
