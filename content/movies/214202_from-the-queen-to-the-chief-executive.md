As he was still a juvenile, the court ordered that he be \"detained at Her Majesty's pleasure,\" a clause in British law allowing the government to imprison young offenders for an indefinite period. The film picks up in 1997, with Yau-ming (now 28) being paid a visit by a girl named Cheung Yue-ling (Ai Jing). With only six months to go before the Handover, Yau-ming and 22 other prisoners hope to have their sentences determined soon, fearing what might happen should the decision about what to do with them become the province of incoming Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2LAmxNHSV2JdzlqJ9pUy0dWit1V.jpg", "actors": ["Stephen Tang Shu-Wing (Councillor Leung Chung Ken)", "Ai Jing (Cheung Yue Ling)", "Herman Yau ()", "Tony Chow ()", "Eddie Chan Shu-Chi ()", "Yeung Kin-Chung ()", "Ursula Wong Yue-Si ()", "David Lee Wai-Sheung (Cheung Yau Ming)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
