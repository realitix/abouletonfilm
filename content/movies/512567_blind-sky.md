A constant contrast between a violent and a domestic world, in which violence, humor and irony, give a new layer to the social and moral conflicts of the characters. A lost house in a forest, an underground bar, a prison, a bus, fields and highways, are the spaces on which thieves, truckers, cooks and hookers collide.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5ijziGFf5qhgrMkeEcVPCtx8n6k.jpg", "actors": ["Luis Ziembrowski (Ignacio)", "Catalina Guerra (Malena)", "Gloria M\u00fcnchmeyer (Julieta)", "Aldo Parodi ()", "Mario Ossand\u00f3n ()", "Mario Ossand\u00f3n ()", "Mar\u00eda Izquierdo ()", "Javier Maldonado ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
