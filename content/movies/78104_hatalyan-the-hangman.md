His job in the abattoir, together with his memories of his past, create a fascinating and complex portrait. His voice, yet unheard, from the edge of Israel's historical events, reveals new insights through his unique perspective. Shalom's clear, alternative voice from the margins of society carries a deeply humanistic universal message.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u8WM5dr9rOUp3lhy3KZoN25FW6U.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
