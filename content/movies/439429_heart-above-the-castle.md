His last major undertaking was hosting the NATO summit in 2002 and N\u011bmec was granted extraordinary access to film it. Set to make a \u201cspecial poetic film\u201d, it took N\u011bmec years to process what he had witnessed \u2013 George W. Bush creating an alliance to invade Iraq. It may then be the director\u2019s revenge to point his camera lens democratically at everyone involved with the summit, giving the same screen time to kitchen and waiting staff, musicians, security detail and NATO protesters, as to the heads of states and attending dignitaries. Havel however, became as much of a subject as the president on screen, and the film\u2019s narrator, providing commentary in his own voice from the distance of a few years after he left the office.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
