The resulting 14 films he created for Essanay find Chaplin further experimenting with new cinematic techniques, while continuing to add complexities and pathos into his celebrated Little Tramp character, soon to become immortalized as the face, hat, and mustache of modern screen comedy.  Essanay and Mutual were Chaplin\u2019s laboratory and he later would borrow heavily from the films he created there to craft the masterworks The Kid (1921), The Gold Rush (1925), City Lights (1931) and Modern Times (1936) for which he is best known and for which he always will be remembered.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cZ5SZgMVNbjF1nwLXR1w1spIzNT.jpg", "actors": ["Charlie Chaplin ()", "Edna Purviance ()", "Ben Turpin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
