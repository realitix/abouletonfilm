The story unravels around the fatalistic pattern of our meek hero's existence-where a chance meeting with the devil offers Jinho an escape hatch to his daily humdrum, and a shot at his greatest fantasy: a night of unbridled passion with all the women of his choosing as his personal sex slaves. Jinho's shy and idiosyncratic character, however, belie the true greed and foolery of his own desires-and steeped in his \"Sysphus-esque\" lack of self-knowledge, he falls prey to the glitter of the forbidden fruit.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jieho Lee (Jinho)", "Star Yoo (Girl 1)", "Lee Hye-young (Devil)", "Eun-shim Kim (Poster girl)", "Jiyoung Kim (Girl in Caf\u00e9)", "Mee-nyuh Lee (Girl 2)", "Yuh-jin Kim (Girl 3)", "Sang-hyo Im (Girl 4)", "Park Eun-hye (Girl 5)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
