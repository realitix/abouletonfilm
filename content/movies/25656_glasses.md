Stepping off a propeller plane onto golden sands, she drags her giant suitcase across the beach to Hamada Inn. Owner Yuji is impressed; it's the first time in three years a guest has made it to the inn without getting lost. The next morning Taeko wakes up to the greetings of peculiar fellow vacationer Sakura who leads the townspeople in funny morning calisthenics on the beach. Thus begins Taeko's strange vacation on this strange island full of strange people. At first Taeko finds the laidback attitude and mass idleness hard to bear, but soon she too begins to see the joy in \"twilighting\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2PEbY6ea1MRtcxJHqLSrNSVA72b.jpg", "actors": ["Satomi Kobayashi (Taeko)", "Mikako Ichikawa (Haruna)", "Ryo Kase (Yomogi)", "Ken Mitsuishi (Yuji)", "Masako Motai (Sakura)", "Hiroko Yakushimaru (Morishita)", "Ken (Koji)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "EmkEyen", "content": "A slow and mellow feelgood comedy with some subtle absurdist touches about the career woman taking a break to a quiet island village. Works well as a lifter upper when life is heavy. \r\n\r\nBut it also has an unintentional dark flip side once you start analyzing it; A mysterious central leader that promotes a low nutrition diet while collecting \"gifts\" and leading collective \"merci\" exercises in the sun and spending days doing introspective \"twilighting\" and projecting carefree happiness on a secluded location with limited outside communications... Is this a cult in the making?\r\n\r\nYes, I'm joking.\r\n\r\nMaybe."}], "recommandations_id": [74982, 109048, 5717, 116303], "youtube_key": "CGYd4TbO3KI"}
