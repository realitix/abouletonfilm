Death Row Uncut collects videos of 28 tunes that Death Row released during their heyday, including \"Dre Day\" and \"Let Me Ride\" by Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg, \"Gin and Juice,\" \"Who Am I (What's My Name),\" and \"Murder Was the Case\" by Snoop Doggy Dogg, \"Natural Born Killers\" by Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, and \"To Live and Die in L.A.,\" \"Hit 'Em Up,\" and \"Dear Mama\" by 2Pac. Death Row Uncut features unreleased live performance clips and uncensored versions of some videos that were softened for broadcast; it also includes an interview with label CEO Suge Knight, who has few kind things to say about his former co-workers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mrhVYT0xCkZQWP7aYeIIdqeLz2D.jpg", "actors": ["Tupac Amaru Shakur ()", "Dr. Dre ()", "Snoop Dogg ()", "Suge Knight ()", "Daz Dillinger ()", "Kurupt ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
