When Henry divorced her mother and married Anne Boleyn, Mary became an outcast and a threat to the Protestant succession. By a twist of fate, on the death of her brother, she became queen at last in 1553, but her attempts to make England Catholic again were a disaster for her and the country. History has called her \"Bloody Mary\" for the burning of the Protestants, but how fair is this? This film paints another picture, of a woman true to her beliefs, pushed towards a terrible psychological disintegration.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2g3jn9ZUusDJHqUps9F3Vw6EW0a.jpg", "actors": ["Miranda French (Mary Tudor)", "Simon Kirke (Dudley)", "Jorge Bal\u00e7a (Philip of Spain)", "Jason Sharp (Henry VIII)", "Lizzie Rees (Young Mary (as Elizabeth Rees))", "Sarah Finigan (Servant)", "Lisa Marie Kennedy (Anne Boleyn)", "Sean Rees (Ambassador Renard)", "Glenn Salvage (Norfolk Noble)", "Aubrey Wakeling (Duke of Norfolk)", "Burtie Welland (Thomas Cromwell)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "gtUX-SpWnFE"}
