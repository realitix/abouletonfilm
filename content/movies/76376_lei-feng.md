After his death, Lei was characterised as a selfless and modest person who was devoted to the Communist Party, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the people of China. In the posthumous \"Learn from Comrade Lei Feng\" campaign, initiated by Mao in 1963, Lei became the symbol of nationwide propaganda; the youth of the country were encouraged to follow his example. After Mao's death, Lei Feng remained a cultural icon symbolizing selflessness, modesty, and dedication; his name entered daily speech and his imagery appeared on t-shirts and memorabilia.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tmk4EpVTW8rnhvnw7mwizK15Y2V.jpg", "actors": ["Jintang Dong (Feng Lei)", "Tongyi Dang ()", "Yanfeng He ()", "Guifa Yang ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "TCLTc-G5n8o"}
