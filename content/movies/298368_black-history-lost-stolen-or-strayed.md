Not many people did in 1968, the year this eye-opening film, narrated by Bill Cosby, was first released. Many still don't today. \"Black History: Lost, Stolen or Strayed\" reviews the numerous contributions of African-Americans to the development of the United States. From the perspective of the turbulent late 1960s, the fact that their positive roles had not generally been taught as part of American history, coupled with the pervasiveness of derogatory stereotypes, was evidence of how Black people had long been victims of negative attitudes and ignorance. Viewing this film today offers students and adults an opportunity to explore their own perspectives - to examine how things have changed in their lives and those of their parents, as well as how troubling stereotypes still persist four decades later.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5AEu0QRVfl5zIdWj96bwwgPhyEt.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Cosby (Narrator)", "Andrew Rooney ()", "Stepin Fetchit ()", "Roy Glenn ()", "Katharine Hepburn ()", "Katharine Houghton ()", "Butterfly McQueen ()", "Sidney Poitier ()", "Isabel Sanford ()", "Shirley Temple ()", "Spencer Tracy ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
