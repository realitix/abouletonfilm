Garuda saw the beautiful Ka Kee, the king's wife, and kidnapped her. The king's musician helped her to escape by also seducing her. The king took offence at Ka Kee's unfaithfulness, for she had slept with three men. He punished her by banishing her to a raft that floated to the middle of the ocean, sure that she would not survive her ordeal.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e614smGyLiiGIslsSw5dOC6OIce.jpg", "actors": ["Sorapong Chatree ()", "Toon Hiranyasap ()", "Ampha Phoosit ()", "\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e22 \u0e2d\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e08\u0e34\u0e19\u0e14\u0e32 ()", "Darm Dasakorn ()", "Duangchiwan Komonsen ()", "Janthana Siriphon ()", "\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e27\u0e07\u0e23\u0e38\u0e08\u0e34\u0e23\u0e32 \u0e2d\u0e34\u0e28\u0e23\u0e32\u0e07\u0e01\u0e39\u0e23 ()", "Jaran 'See Tao' Petcharoen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
