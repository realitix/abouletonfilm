The movie lasts 100 minutes, & a fast moving story. As the name depicts Kendasampige has a fragrance of love, crime & destiny. It's a master piece. Story telling at it's best. There are no big names in the casting, narration of the story is amazing. Hey this movie is few notches well above the recent releases. A Quality film, descent & neat story with a very good background score. What stole my attention & made me very glad was \"Cinematography\" . Amazing camera work. The film is shot within Karnataka & you will fall in love with the places & aerial shots by Drones are awesome. Now I am sure there would be more tourists flocking \"Chitradurgada Kallina Kote\". Full Paisa Vasool for watching it on a big screen with 7.1 Dolby theater & I am ready to watch Part-2 of this movie. I loved the villain of the movie, the depth in his voice is amazing. Suri & team, Very well done."}], "recommandations_id": []}
