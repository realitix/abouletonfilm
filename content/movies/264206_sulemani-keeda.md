When they\u2019re not being rejected by producers who refuse to read their script, they lurk around bookstores and poetry slams shamelessly hitting on girls. They find some hope when the drug addled, cat-obsessed Gonzo Kapoor, the son of a famous B movie producer, hires them to write an art house film billed as \u201cTarkovsky with orgies\u201d for his directorial debut. All seems well until Dulal meets Ruma, a beautiful photographer who makes him question his choice to sell out.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qQCtPstNRe2r9YGAMUd0tFYBrmv.jpg", "actors": ["Naveen Kasturia (Dulal)", "Mayank Tewari (Mainak)", "Aditi Vasudev (Ruma)", "Karan Mirchandani (Gonzo)", "Krishna Singh Bisht (Pokhriyal)", "Rukshana Tabassum (Oona from Poona)", "Dilip Prabhavalkar (Nene)", "Dilip Prabhavalkar (Sweety Kapoor)", "Rohini Ramanathan (Rohini)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
