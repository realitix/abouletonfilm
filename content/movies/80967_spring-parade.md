The original 1934 version stars Franciska Gaal as a Hungarian serving girl who heads to Vienna to visit a relative. Stopping over at an outdoor carnival, Gaal is told by a fortune teller that she will enjoy a happy marriage with a handsome and wealthy stranger. Later on, she finds herself at a fancy dress ball, where a good-looking aristocrat, assuming that our heroine is a countess masquerading as a peasant, falls in love with her. Delighted that the fortune-teller's prophecy seems to be coming true, Gaal finds herself in a dilemma when she falls in love with poverty-stricken soldier Wolf Albach Retty. But things turn out OK when Retty, the regimental drummer, composes a hit song which brings him fame and fortune, thereby neatly fulfilling that prophecy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7RlSzQOcM5VadzWC0vixbUnURI3.jpg", "actors": ["Paul H\u00f6rbiger (Kaiser Franz Joseph)", "Franziska Gaal (Marika)", "Wolf Albach-Retty (Wilhelm August Jurek)", "Theo Lingen (Baron Zorndorf)", "Adele Sandrock (Gr\u00e4fin Burgst\u00e4tten)", "Piroska Vaszary (Nanette)", "Annie Rosar (Frau Taschlmeier)", "Hans Richter (Fritzi)", "Anton Pointner (Hauptmann Weber)", "Tibor Halmay (Korporal Stadler)", "Fritz Imhoff (Feldwebel Mittermeier)", "Hans Moser (Friseur Swoboda)", "Richard Eybner (Ein Komiteeherr)", "Alfred Neugebauer (Kammerdiener Zimmerl)", "Alfred Gerasch ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
