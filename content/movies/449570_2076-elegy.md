Looking at the images, they are struck by the past, causing them to dig into their own memories, history, and identity.  Gleaned from images from the filmmaker's life, 2076 looks at the ways in which familial history and queer identity are communicated through the archive/photographic image. Topically situated as the analog image is quickly disappearing, this film explores its virtues, illustrating the ways in which the past imbues small moments with power and glimpses of our past can speak and serve as catharsis to our present.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fMGnwOMxyiHUvb5epC9uBoSxe7y.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
