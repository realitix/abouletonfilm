The film decodes the mythic story of Rapunzel, re-framing the folk tale in a variety of unlikely ways, revealing its darker edges and exploring its role in the relationship between patriarchy and childhood. Look out for Lora Logic from X-Ray Spex, plus Dave Swarbrick from Fairport Convention.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/242xWRTI91Q0fOeFVPeMNY0jLlw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
