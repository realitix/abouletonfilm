His enemies take away his privileges when he is away. The shock of being \"unwanted\" parallels a deeper disappointment in his private life: his wife has an affair with a jealous young rival, and after 15 years of marriage and two daughters wants a divorce. She offers no explanations as he tries to untie these problems himself. All the moves he makes are the wrong ones. He takes on drinking heavily with students eager to attend his seminar after discovering the class has been canceled. The journalist, once suave and commanding is reduced to silence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mMLtYKRwZW66k0vfqlXjIiFMPPP.jpg", "actors": ["Zbigniew Zapasiewicz (Jerzy Michalowski)", "Ewa Dalkowska (Ewa Michalowska)", "Andrzej Seweryn (Jerzy Rosciszewski)", "Krystyna Janda (Agata)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [117483, 51010, 47161, 104858], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
