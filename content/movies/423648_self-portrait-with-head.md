The carefully applied makeup and wig tell of disguise and acting, and are simultaneously beautiful and terribly stony like the anonymous woman\u00b4s head. The brevity and slow speed are reminiscent of Andy Warhol\u00b4s Screen Tests, in which every single one of the face\u00b4s movements become visible.\u201d \u2013 Brigitta Burger-Utzer", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dp86s4bXv7Ubq2KSAWm6IpRqoHv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
