Can they outdo themselves? Would they dare to outdo themselves? The answer is a resounding and unequivocal yes.  Trespass has some of the most stunning cinematography you'll ever see - and we're not talking about porn. This film - and we do mean film - is exquisite. On two discs (get the Hardcore one if you can; it's one of the best ever), this is an essential work from a true master craftsman. And it's fucking nasty and hot as hell to boot!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mc23abhJEYEUe51jcok6iDVoUVS.jpg", "actors": ["Dred Scott ()", "Jon Galt ()", "Billy Wild ()", "Andrew Addams ()", "Bruce Warren ()", "Tom Daniels ()", "Scott Parker ()", "Makos Servano ()", "Michael Brandon ()", "Jett Adler ()", "Dan Dirk ()", "Alexandros Matsagos ()", "Patrick Knight ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
