Five professional wrestling matches were scheduled on the card. The main event was a rematch for the WWF Championship, which saw Hulk Hogan defeat the champion, The Undertaker, to regain the title. Hogan had lost the championship six days earlier at Survivor Series in a controversial finish. The featured bout on the undercard saw Randy Savage, in his first match since WrestleMania VII, defeat Jake Roberts.  The event was an attempt by the WWF to establish Tuesday as a secondary pay-per-view night. Lukewarm reaction and a disappointing 1.0 buyrate rendered the experiment a failure, and the company shelved its plans until nearly thirteen years later, when it held Taboo Tuesday.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Aa7oCQbv106msP84x4f9a3BWSUo.jpg", "actors": ["Bret Hart (Himself)", "Randy Savage (\"Macho King\" Randy Savage)", "Aurelian Jake Smith Jr. (Himself)", "Davey Boy Smith (Himself)", "Hulk Hogan (Himself)", "Mark William Calaway (The Undertaker)", "Barry Allen Darsow (Repo Man)", "Terry Szopinski (The Warlord)", "Mike Jones (Virgil)", "Merced Solis (El Matador)", "Ric Flair (Himself)", "Elizabeth Hulette (Miss Elizabeth)", "Steve Keirn (Skinner)", "William Moody (Paul Bearer)", "Bobby Heenan (Himself)", "Gene Okerlund (Himself)", "Robert Marella (Gorilla Monsoon)", "Ted DiBiase (Himself)", "Sherri Martel (Sensational Sherri)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
