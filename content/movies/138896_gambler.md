I admit that I have often watched Indian films. I like their music and dance, but this \"masterpiece\" made me disappointed in Indian cinema. The way they depicted <a href=\"http://www.brooklynjumbies.com/\">spin palace casino</a> and gamblers caused me something mid-range between disgust and laughter. I do not understand what they thought when filming this movie. Of course, you can watch it, but only if you do not mind spending 3 hours of your life in vain. Of course, there were quite good moments, but the whole movie disappointed me"}], "recommandations_id": []}
