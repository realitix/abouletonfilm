With the help of prominent performers and producers including Michael Martin Murphey, Robbie Fulks and Ray Benson, Rich explores the early origins of country music in Nashville and Austin. He visits the rustic studios where this much-loved sound was born and discovers how the genre has reinvented itself with influences from bluegrass, western swing and americana.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h8F6eLQaXmsjJnY02rrECNewmf1.jpg", "actors": ["Rich Hall (Himself)", "Ray Benson (Himself)", "Robbie Fulks (Himself)", "Michael Martin Murphey (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Rs2YUQ5Jh9Y"}
