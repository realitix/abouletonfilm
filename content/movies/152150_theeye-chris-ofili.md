Combining a cycle of paintings depicting lovers in a Paradise-like garden with a shimmering glass dome, Ofili plunged visitors into disorienting spaces of dense colour and enveloping light.  Shot in London, Germany and Venice, this film relates the creation of Within Reach. Chris Ofili's reflections on the process are complemented by interviews with his collaborator in Venice, architect David Adjaye, and the structural engineer from Arup Associates, who helped realise the complex dome.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zlWmmvCI19v6l1SA47XabnM7BE2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
