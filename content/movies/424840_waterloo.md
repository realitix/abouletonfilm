'Waterloo' presents a tale of several people involved in the final battle. Napoleon and Wellington, of course, but also the Austrian general Blutcher (who is seen as a ladies' man - his scene with a flirty Countess about halfway through the film is priceless; as are his touching scenes with his plain wife (who he imagines to be a young and nubile girl when they get romantic) and some people within his regiment. Not simply a film of war, 'Waterloo' is a story of people, of lovers, of lost opportunities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kC0QPW6UlnCVpXfsETdPIIfeKmy.jpg", "actors": ["Charles Willy Kayser (K\u00f6nig Friedrich Wilhelm III.)", "Charles Vanel (Napoleon)", "Otto Geb\u00fchr ('Der alte Fritz' & Feldmarschall Bl\u00fccher)", "Auguste Prasch-Grevenberg (Bl\u00fcchers Frau)", "Friedrich Ulmer (Gneisenau)", "Georg Henrich (Hardenberg)", "Karl Graumann (F\u00fcrst Metternich)", "Humberston Wright (Herzog Wellington)", "Carl de Vogt (Marshall Ney)", "Helmuth Renar (Talleyrand)", "Vera Malinovskaya (Gr\u00e4fin Tarnowska)", "Camilla von Hollay (Ihre Zofe)", "Oskar Marion (Leutnant Reutlingen, Bl\u00fcchers Adjutant)", "Betty Bird (Rieke, seine Braut)", "Fred Immler (Erster Grenadier)", "Franz Scharwenka (Zweiter Grenadier)", "Will Dohm (Graf Lagarde)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
