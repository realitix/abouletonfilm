The immigrants were despised by the local population who feared their 'invasion'. While many embraced the Israeli lifestyle, others chose to live in self-made Russian ghettos. These ghettos were a fertile ground for the creation of self-hating Jewish skinheads. 'White Panther' is the story of Alex, a young Russian immigrant who joins a skinheads' gang, led by his older brother. An unexpected meeting with David, a religious Moroccan Jew, gives Alex a chance to pursue his longtime dream of becoming a boxer like his father. Alex finds himself torn between his two father figures - his violent older brother and his new Jewish trainer, only to find out the truth about those he so admires.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kG87L5yPXSN4zKjXzHiVsTxd0SQ.jpg", "actors": ["Yevgeny Orlov (Alex Zeitlin)", "Ze'ev Revach (David Ohana)", "Meytal Gal (Yasmin Ohana)", "Natasha Manor (Vera Zeitlin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
