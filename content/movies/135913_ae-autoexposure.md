Seconds later, he watches both get hit by a pickup truck driven by a self-appointed avenger, someone weary of feeling defenseless against the urban violence, and who decided to take action. Henrique recovers his stolen equipment and leaves, feeling avenged. But he goes back to find the memory card, with the photos, lost during the crash. From that moment, he is trapped in a situation where he is now the criminal for failing to rescue a victim, who had been his aggressor. Going from the murder scene to the police station, and then to the emergency ward of the public hospital, he attempts to clear himself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7nMvt5SQuD08cbHXN6IxbKlzbeC.jpg", "actors": ["Gustavo Machado ()", "S\u00edlvio Guindane ()", "Caco Ciocler ()", "Thelmo Fernandes ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
