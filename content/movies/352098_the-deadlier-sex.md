She has him kidnapped and deposited in a forest far from his office in the city. His struggles in this unfamiliar environment and interactions with the inhabitants of the area, including a disguised Sweet, bring about an alteration in his value system. Despite its ridiculous plot, this unpretentious film provides surprisingly lively fun. Boris Karloff, appearing in his fifth film, has a small role."}], "recommandations_id": []}
