I wasn\u2019t sure if the dog became scared because it was surprised that this big eye that was pointed at it did not express any fear, or that it was the dog\u2019s own image, reflected in the camera lens, that scared it. However it may be; the dog got scared and ran away. This made me realize that maybe it also works like that internally. If you face your fears in a calm and quiet state of mind, you may drive them off or even serve as a mirror to them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lMQaQ51oLMNSl6XRGprxq6QbmxQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
