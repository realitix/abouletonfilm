Loud and aggressive but equally sensitive and intense. Live this bluesman to the backbone is always an event. His guitar playing is full of passion and spectacular. His voice soulful. The rhythm section, Tenny Tahamata on bass and Rob Heijne on drums, is solid, swinging and pushing Sas to great heights.\u2018Wandering Between Worlds\u2019 is the first live CD (and the first live DVD) on which Heijne can be heard.  The DVD \u2018Wandering Between Worlds\u2019 features a registration of the show that Julian Sas and his comrades performed for a frantically enthusiastic audience at De Boerderij, a large venue in Zoetermeer, The Netherlands. The best Julian Sas gig ever, according to connoisseurs. This, almost 2 hours long, recording includes, highlights from Julian Sas\u2019 repertoire as well as 4 brand-new songs", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/stRcXi1KritXDjYgXZuef4nqAS3.jpg", "actors": ["Julian sas (blues-guitarist, vocals)", "Tenny Tahamata (bass)", "Rob Heijne (drums)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Q0ZiDVnO8Tg"}
