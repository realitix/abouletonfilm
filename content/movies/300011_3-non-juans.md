Of course that's easy for these three veterans of comedy since their first language is English. Filmed at the El Portal Theater the 3 Non Juans talk about the joys and perils of living in a Spanish speaking culture without speaking a word of Spanish and making a living doing it in a not so brown world, all stereo types welcome. This show is definitely for the Spanish Impaired...IT'S IN ENGLISH PEOPLE!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z7XwaWTIAaX6w6lIutjI3QqSKWx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
