Time travellers are supposed to be observers, and are strictly forbidden to land their flying saucers. One time traveller who broke this rule accidentally killed a dog, changing history and causing many future people to disappear. Inspired by his Great Aunt Mavis, Dominick decides to find his great great grandfather. He begins to land in 1980, where his strange clothes and speech make him seem an eccentric oddball. His quest brings him into contact with beautiful boutique owner Jane, and they fall in love. As Dominick's visits become more frequent and more prolonged, he increasingly risks his indiscretion being discovered by his boss, Caleb Line, and every moment he spends in the past increases the danger that he will catastrophically change the future", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/22c7equtupCRU7tZteJJpGDssif.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Firth (Dominick Hide)", "Caroline Langrishe (Jane Winters)", "Patrick Magee (Caleb Line)", "Pippa Guard (Ava)", "Trevor Ray ()", "Sylvia Coleridge ()", "Jean Trend ()", "Timothy Davies ()", "Denis Lawson ()", "Bernadette Shortt ()", "Tony Melody ()", "Karl Howman ()", "Phil Davis ()", "Mark Wingett ()", "Michael Carter ()", "Jenny Donnison ()", "Nicholas McArdle ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
