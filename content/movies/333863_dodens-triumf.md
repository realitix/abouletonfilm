First broadcast in 1971.  The ballet was first performed by the Danish Royal Ballet, first as a TV show on the Danish public service channel called DR in 1971, then as a performance at the Danish Royal Theatre in 1972. The main part was danced by Vivi Flindt, and Flemming Flindt also starred. The ballet caused quite a stir, partly because of its spectacular nude dancing, but also the catchy music, published both complete on vinyl (which double-lp) and in abbreviated form on vinyl and CD.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Vivi Flindt ()", "Flemming Flindt ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ew35N8B0Pv8"}
