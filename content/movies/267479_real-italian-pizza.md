The backdrop is a typical New York pizza stand, the actors are selected New Yorkers who happened to be there during the half year, the plot is the somewhat sinister aimlessness of life itself.\" - Donald Ritchie, Museum of Modern Art, NY.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wSSdEWFov4CRILnmBdFW7AkZBem.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
