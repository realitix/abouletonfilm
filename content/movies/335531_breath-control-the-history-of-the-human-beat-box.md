Unfortunately, its contribution has been largely overlooked, as has the fun, expressive, human, and spontaneous dimension of Hip Hop that it represents. Over 30 practitioners of this art form discuss their techniques and the evolution of their craft, through interviews, live performances, archival footage, and animation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9Qrr5wVx6PjUlRXnEcNdCDvbp5B.jpg", "actors": ["Biz Markie (Himself)", "Doug E.
