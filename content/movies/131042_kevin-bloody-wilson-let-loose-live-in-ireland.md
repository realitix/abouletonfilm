It features a catalogue of self penned bawdy ballads that translate to every English speaking country in the world. In addition to the performance, we see another side of Kev. Also included are bonus film clips from Kev, as well as a special on stage performance from Kevs support act on the tour - Jenny Talia from Australia.
