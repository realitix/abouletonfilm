This outstanding film had its world premiere in Johannesburg on March 15th 2008, a few days after its author settled in Sweden. We were very proud to see our name in the acknowledgements at the end as we\u2019ve always emphasised the cinematographic legacy of Guy Debord, one of this resurrection\u2019s spiritual leaders, in Kaganof\u2019s work. The film starts with a quotation from Debord dating back to 1956 about cinematographic cut-ups, which were also essential to our latest film. Kaganof has re-invented the cut-up technique for this film, transforming the \u201crandom\u201d aspect of the editing into an area of reflection and synthesis", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pgMDODzIwVvk0OUn2WSvSV83mdt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
