Although their heavier counterparts historically have received more attention, the Nazis' light tanks -- the Panzer I and II -- nonetheless played an invaluable role. This documentary zeros in on the smaller, more nimble machines, which, despite their light weight and thin armor, were a critical component in the defeats of Poland, France, Yugoslavia and Greece.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
