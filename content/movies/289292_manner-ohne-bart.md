But in reality, the rather imaginative ninth grader has trouble moving up to the next grade. Fortunately, his teacher Nickel notices that Otto does not lack intelligence, but the ability to use his imagination for the requirements of everyday school life. Together with school director Menschke, Nickel tries to change Otto\u2019s attitude. Although this is easier said than done, Otto eventually realizes that he has to try to build his cloud-castles only after school has ended. And his teacher is going to support him in his attempts.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3YT6hXkAIVBpTpdMJOb1amT0DeD.jpg", "actors": ["Hermann Beyer (Lehrer Nickel)", "Manfred Boehm (Otto Hintz)", "K\u00e4the Reichel (Frau Hintz)", "Rolf Hoppe (Gangster)", "Dieter Franke ()", "Gert Grasse ()", "Margot Busse ()", "Ursula Staack ()", "Horst Hiemer ()", "Ostara K\u00f6rner ()", "Kurt Radeke ()", "Heinz-Karl Konrad ()", "G\u00fcnter Zsch\u00e4ckel ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
