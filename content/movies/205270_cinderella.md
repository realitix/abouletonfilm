It\u2019s more cinematic than a lot of the other films of this time, using some real locations and three-dimensional sets rather than simple painted backdrops. There\u2019s an impressive effect where a wall blows in to reveal what is happening elsewhere in the story world. I found the film a little dull overall though due to the overly familiar story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vRTx7f5eFFkv81GUTzhan7zhb6Y.jpg", "actors": ["Louise Lagrange (Cendrillon)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
