She knows she struck something, but left the scene before determining what it was - and if it was alive. She's allowed this event has taken over her life, and now lives in near-isolation with an equally lonely man. When a stranger enters her life that may hold the key to her past, reality becomes stranger than nightmares, and memories cannot be trusted.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nse1jN3qYhmq8BPPKocIneWErZL.jpg", "actors": ["Paulina Porizkova (Diane Thwaite)", "Julian Sands (Michael James)", "Julianne Nicholson (Vivian James / Phoebe)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
