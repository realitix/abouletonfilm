Ezomi leaves her for another woman, but suddenly becomes impotent and -- impotent pimps not being much good at controlling their stables -- promptly loses all of his hookers. Director Sone at least attempts to give the film his usual quirky attitude and glossy look, but the material really needed a grittier approach from a director of perhaps less talent, but more sleaze credibility.
