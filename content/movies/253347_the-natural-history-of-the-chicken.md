A Maine farmer says she found a chicken frozen stiff, but was able to resuscitate it. Colorado natives tell a story of the chicken who lost its head-- and went on living. A Virginia farmer tells about (and demonstrates) the benefits of raising chickens for his own consumption. Perhaps most surprising is the case of the Florida woman: she bathes her pet bird, and takes it both swimming and shopping. Through these and other stories, this documentary illuminates the role that chickens play in (some of) our lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rScIAzZSYjhqEPs3CrXH3lEdJYH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
