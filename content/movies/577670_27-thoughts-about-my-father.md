Using home movies, snapshots and found footage, he creates a portrait of a exceedingly clever, yet evanescent father figure haunted by the war that sent his own father to a concentration camp. Ultimately the family moved to Canada. This political history, intertwining dreams and personal experience, seems loose and associative, but first impressions can be deceiving.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c4pgNvFktlJsAuPmnQrDKopoTQt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
