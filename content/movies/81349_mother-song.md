Italian opera favorites Beniamino Gigli and Maria Cebotari star in this tale about the romance between two temperamental singing stars. Highlights include a lengthy selection from Faust, with Gigli making a most impressive Mephistopheles. The plot takes a melodramatic turn towards the climax, with the lives of the characters mirrored in their on-stage behavior. Director Carmine Gallone was something of an expert in the field of filmed opera, as witness his Tosca, Rigoletto and Il Trovatore.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7hHDrNDgfYYgfKjMsHd8EXdB9XV.jpg", "actors": ["Beniamino Gigli (Ettore Vanni)", "Maria Cebotari (Fiamma Vanni - seine Frau)", "Peter Bosse (Mario - sein Sohn)", "Hans Moser (Giulio St\u00fcckelmeier)", "Michael Bohnen (Cesare Doret)", "Hilde Hildebrand (Ricarda Doret, seine Frau)", "Alfred Gerasch (Intendant)", "Josef Dahmen (Inspizient)", "Werner Pledath (Arzt)", "Hilde Maroff (Krankenschwester)", "Herbert Gernot (Rechtsanwalt)", "Philipp Lothar Mayring ()", "Rio Nobile (Chauffeur)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
