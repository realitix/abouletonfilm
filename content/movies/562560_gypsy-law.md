{"tmdb_id": 562560, "title": "Gypsy Law", "original_title": "Kriss Romani", "slug_title": "gypsy-law", "date": "1963-05-24", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "The idyllic life of a beautiful gypsy girl is shattered when she runs away from a pre-arranged marriage to a member of her tribe. Away from the safety of her people, she encounters bigotry against her kind. A little girl feels sorry for the missing gypsy beauty and searches for a magic root that can cure the wandering gypsy from her wanderlust and bring her home again. Music, dance, ancient gypsy rituals, and colorful European scenery highlight this feature which takes a decidedly jaundiced view of the racial indignities suffered by the heroine.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3sIuKihufcH85a0XUSMRZ5bGowy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
