At the same time he is one of those we know least about. Now Winnerb\u00e4ck celebrates 20 years as an artist, despite barely filling 40. This documentary takes us closer to him than ever, while summarizing a musically unlikely career. But most of all, it gives an insight into an extremely complex human being, with all its weaknesses and characteristics reflecting an entire generation's feelings. In addition to Lars Winnerb\u00e4ck is featured in the film Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd, Per Gessle and Melissa Horn. Director and producer are \u00d8ystein Karlsen, who is behind successes like Dag og Lilyhammer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wCMevfMdUtd3hBqmx7cF00hI2Sh.jpg", "actors": ["Lars Winnerb\u00e4ck (Himself)", "Melissa Horn (Herself)", "Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
