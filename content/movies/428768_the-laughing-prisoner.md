This time it is a successful television presenter (Jools Holland) who decides to quit at the height of his stardom. He is abducted from his apartment and brought to the village, where number 2 (a young Stephen Fry) is questioning him. The whole show has a cosy 1980's feel to it, with several bands from that period performing their music.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Terence Alexander (Head of Channel 4)", "Stephen Fry (No. 2)", "Jools Holland (No. 7)", "Hugh Laurie (Assistant)", "Patrick McGoohan (Number Six)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
