He blows smoke rings which do little tricks. He looks at the audience and taps the ash off his cigar. The telephone rings and makes Jerry jump - he looks cross. We see Jerry and the person he is speaking to in little circular cut-outs placed on another image of a landscape with telegraph poles stretching off into the distance. The man Jerry is speaking to is wearing a dressing gown and a funny little hat - possibly Scottish. The man says: \"I want you to paper the parlour.\" Jerry nods and replies: \"I'll be on the job in ten minutes!\" Jerry attempts to put a wallpaper table together. Slapstick stuff ensues. It keeps collapsing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gRkUe2YpfAFLBOs6QdmGn0AJUPn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
