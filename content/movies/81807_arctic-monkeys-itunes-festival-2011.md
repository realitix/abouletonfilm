From the flinty-eyed observations of errant behaviour on their debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That\u2019s What I\u2019m Not, to the more elemental prophecies of this year\u2019s Suck It And See, his voice remains a sharp tool, ready to dissect anything, from a bad night out to the melancholy effects of the aging process.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
