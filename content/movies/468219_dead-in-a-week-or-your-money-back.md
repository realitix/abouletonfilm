Movies ike this usually end up being at the very least **moderately** successful (in terms of quality) and the Brits are particularly good at it. This isn't the sort of movie that I'm going to hold dear to my heart for all time or anything, but I'm glad that _Dead in a Week_ is good, saves me from having to make some sort of \"_My Money Back_\" joke.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"}], "recommandations_id": [545957, 321558, 304816, 473317], "youtube_key": "iBdH5uNf14Q"}
