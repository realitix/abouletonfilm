At least to a certain Buenos Aires photographer, who spends his nights driving through the city in search of capturing the perfect accident. Meanwhile, another man is trying to find a legendary cock sucker who hides somewhere in the dark rooms of a gay sex club. Accidentes Gloriosos tells nine different stories of death and transformation. From the man who undergoes a heart transplant and wakes up with new and strange artistic powers, to the woman who receives a last letter from her husband, written just before he freezes to death in one of history s most dramatic polar expeditions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/80AiEOXq7lgxIXag2xmHloWDTZr.jpg", "actors": ["Sof\u00eda Del Tuffo ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
