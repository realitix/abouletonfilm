From then on we get random scenes of bad guys being sent to kill our renegade as he defeats them repeatedly. Neither storyline has anything to do with the other, and were obviously combined for reasons of padding", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3aTAj7h5MyLyH4VeNessUKSOGAE.jpg", "actors": ["Mike Abbott ()", "Mark Watson ()", "Pedro Ernyes ()", "Lu Hsiao-Fen ((as Fonda Lynn))", "Chang Fu-Mei ((as Lona Chang))", "Allen Chao ((as Sydney Chao))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
