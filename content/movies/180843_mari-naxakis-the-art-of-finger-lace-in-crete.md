Over the years, the Cretan \u201cpetseta\u201d has become a very important part of their dowry, their life and their personality. On each \u201cpetseta\u201d there are warp threads that must be fastened. A simple knot would be enough, until some woman, playing with the loose threads, created the first finger lace pattern. This is the main subject of this film. Mrs Marie Naxaki\u2019s encounter with these women led to the joy of talking about the past and the special meaning of the finger lace edging.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bjsKpTX1HFJC4UzuPZEiEIrOSwL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
