The top-in-line in anyone's double-header, it's a home run guaranteed to make everyone score! Beautiful Lolita, queen of all the hookers, incarcerated in the city jail, finds more thrills than bargained for when she aggressively solicits her warden for improved jail conditions. She finds the sex starved public servant has one goal - to be governor - and has spent the jail refurbishing funds for his campaign. Lolita and the warden decide to have a \"whing ding\" of a baseball game to refill the jail fund and to quell his desires. The burly studs of Cellblock B, a melee that contests brawn against brains, and bawdy bodies, see the Beavers against the Dicks, it's a game you'll never forget and a ballgame played like you've never seen before!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kPW31bWK39lJZ6SClvhnto4AxHd.jpg", "actors": ["April Grant (The Beavers (as Ginger Lee Grace))", "Ashley Welles (The Dicks (as Kelly Evans))", "Brandy Lee (The Beavers)", "Candida Royalle (Lolita Wanamaker)", "Connie Peterson (The Beavers (as Connie Peters))", "Jennifer West (The Beavers)", "Lisa De Leeuw (Miss Cole)", "Maria Tortuga (The Beavers)", "Rachael Livingston (The Beavers)", "Susan Nero (The Dicks (as Susann Nero))", "Tawny Pearl (The Beavers)", "Tiffany Clark (The Beavers)", "Greg Michaels (The Dicks)", "Herschel Savage (The Dicks (as Vic Falcon))", "Ian MacGregor (Warden Blowhard (as Sir Lawrence Rothchild))", "Jack Shute (The Dicks (as Jack Chute))", "Jesse Adams (The Dicks)", "Mike Ranger (The Dicks)", "R.J.
