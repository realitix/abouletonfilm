It's something that tends to happen a lot in the horror genre, though calling Treehouse a horror movie is a bit of stretch.\r\n\r\nIt's difficult to grasp just what the makers were going for since the film goes nowhere fast and quickly loses focus to the point that nothing much makes sense. It starts off promising enough, with a nice musical score and some nifty location photography work. Then it piles on the exposition, throws in some poor acting, all building towards a laughable finale that is most certainly not worth waiting for - and again the reveal doesn't make any sense given what had happened earlier in the piece.\r\n\r\nPoor and best avoided unless you want to feel angry? 1/10"}], "recommandations_id": [428282, 254010, 376502, 126938], "youtube_key": "wkX-Jj4nOBU"}
