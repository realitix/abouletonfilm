Warsih, on the other hand, is not at all interested in Basuki as she is in love with Kuncoro. Both Warsih and Kuncoro are suspicious of how Basuki became rich. Then they ask a psychic about Basuki. This makes Nyi Blorong even more furious. When she seeks advice from her \u201csuperior\u201d, she is told to return to the \u201cspirit\u201d world she belongs to.
