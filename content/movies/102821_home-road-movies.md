He buys a Peugeot station wagon - license plate GFP831E, and the family sets off for annual holidays exploring every corner of Europe - \"adopting local customs but never forgetting who won the war.\" The narrator is one of the children who, as he ages, sees things he missed as a lad - the car no rocket, dad no speedster. As the years wear on, and the car sits in the driveway, dad keeps it ready for the next great summer holiday.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aInIZ0dHHMSEd0RTxZ2D0SR71th.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
