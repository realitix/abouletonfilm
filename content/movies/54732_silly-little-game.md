But for all this success, the story of the game\u2019s inception is little known. The modern fantasy leagues can be traced back to a group of writers and academics who met at La Rotisserie Francaise in New York City to form a baseball league of their own: The Rotisserie League. The game quickly grew in popularity, and with the growing use and attractiveness of the Internet, the \u201cfounding fathers\u201d never foresaw how their creation would take off and ultimately leave them behind. Innovative filmmakers Adam Kurland and Lucas Jansen will chronicle the early development and ultimate explosion of Rotisserie Baseball, and shine a light on its mostly unnoticed innovators.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ggIiRYEpK2z4Dp684ExakHmrSeL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [54677, 132858], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
