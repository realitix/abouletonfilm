Bored with what we knew, we ushered in Bands that lived harder and drank more than we did - bands like Hanoi Rocks, Guns N Roses, Jane's Addiction. It was freeing to be young and rock'n'roll - we changed the fashion and its rules, ran the town, set the scene and remade Melrose ave. our street. It was OUR time, Scenester's in Los Angeles. This 80 minute documentary goes back to the clubs, the scenester's, and the 'mover and shakers\" of the time - the bands. A non-judgemental look at a musical movement that defined a generation and explained a culture.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
