The actor Sakagami Shinobu wrote and directed this version. This new interpretation focuses on a woman who played a minor role in the original version, and features a bold performance from former pin-up model Fujikawa Nozomi. Yohee (Yasuda Shingo), son and heir of the store Kawachiya, runs up huge debts due to his obsession with the prostitute Okiku (Fujikawa). Told by her husband Chizaemon, Okichi (Yamada Kinuwo) goes to condemn Yohee. On her way back home, Okiku laughs and mocks her, which Okichi finds sexually exciting.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/euHu3Kgugapf85MvqribS1JQGc2.jpg", "actors": ["Nozomi Fujikawa (Okiku)", "Kinuo Yamada (Okichi)", "Shingo Yasuda (Yohee)", "Y\u016brei Yanagi ()", "Sh\u00f4hei Hino ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "gSQxHOqB9uY"}
