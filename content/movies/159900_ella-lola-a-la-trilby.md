She dances barefoot without stockings and is dressed in a long, flowing gown bound across the bosom in Grecian style, with inside fringe and a draped cape hooked to her wrist. She also wears what appears to be a garland headpiece. Holding her gown with one hand throughout, the dancer performs a series of kicks and turns with leg kicks front and back, rocking, and round de jambe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2bLPnhXKyMrUVdiOTaOXLflO4bW.jpg", "actors": ["Ella Lola (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
