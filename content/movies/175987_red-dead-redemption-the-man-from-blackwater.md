The West is dying. The American frontier is undergoing a violent transition from the ways of old to modern times, and Mexico has entered a prolonged period of bloody civil war. Reformed outlaw John Marston is on his way to capture former running buddy Bill Williamson when he comes upon a half dead snake oil merchant named West Dickens. Marston travels under a bleak and unforgiving sun, teaming up with a violent sheriff and a colorful mentally deranged grave robber and together they discover a bloody massacre of homesteaders left in the wake of Williamson. They hatch a plan to break into an abandoned fort where the Williamson Gang is holed up - and a dark, surprising twist ensues.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5YnXi13ShgL0Um0RSjSR1BZvxcS.jpg", "actors": ["Rob Wiethoff (John Marston)", "Kevin Glikmann (Seth Briars)", "Don Creech (Nigel West Dickens)", "Anthony De Longis (Marshal Leigh Johnson)", "Brad Carter (Jonah)", "Frank Noon (Eli)", "David Scott (Prisoner)", "Kate Simses (Jenny)", "Murphy Guyer (Aquila)", "Alison Smith (Woman in Barn)", "Jane Montosi (Angry Farmhouse Wife)", "Steve J.
