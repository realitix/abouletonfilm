A group of five friends escape the drab mundanity of daily existence and sample a hedonistic cocktail of drugs, clubs and sex. Jip (John Simm) is a twenty-something shop worker, Lulu (Lorraine Pilkington) is a full-on clubber, Moff (Danny Dyer) is a chilled-out dope dealer who also happens to be the son of a policeman, whilst Koop (Shaun Parkes) works in a record shop and gets increasingly paranoid that someone will steal his girlfriend Nina (Nicola Reynolds). Together, the five friends move from nightclubs to parties, getting more and more stoned as the night progresses. The soundtrack features club favourites by Fat Boy Slim, Underworld and Primal Scream.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gx2tV9phQtnYkaezDBAA2lqyMu5.jpg", "actors": ["John Simm (Jip)", "Shaun Parkes (Koop)", "Lorraine Pilkington (Lulu)", "Nicola Reynolds (Nina)", "Danny Dyer (Moff)", "Dean Davies (Lee)", "Andrew Lincoln (Felix)", "Jan Anderson (Karen Benson)", "Terence Beesley (Moff's Father)", "Richard Coyle (Andy)", "Jo Brand (Reality)", "Peter Albert (Lulu's Uncle Albert)", "Carl Cox (Pablo Hassan)", "Stephanie Brooks (Fleur)", "Howard Marks (Himself)", "Helen Griffin (Jip's Mother)", "Justin Kerrigan (Ziggy Marlon)", "Danny Midwinter (Tyrone)", "Larrington Walker (Koop's Father)", "Menna Trussler (Lulu's Auntie)", "Philip Rosch (Jip's Manager)", "Mark Seaman (Jeremy Factsman)", "Lynne Seymour (Connie)", "Patrick Taggart (Luke)", "Anna Wilson (Boomshanka)", "Robert Marable (Casey)", "Nick Kilroy (Herbie)", "Tyrone Johnson (Hip Hop Junkie)", "Peter Bramhill (Matt)", "Anne Bowen (Moff's Grandmother)", "Carol Harrison (Moff's Mum)", "Giles Thomas (Martin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
