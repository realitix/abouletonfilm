Pranchiyettan, is a successful businessman based in Thrissur. He is a devotee of Saint Francis of Assisi and often has imaginary conversations with the saint. His ancestors were rice traders, but he has grown beyond the small rice shop to expand his business into jewellery, real estate, finance, shopping complexes and lot more. Even though he is successful and wealthy, he is not well-educated and he is unhappy with his name and also wants to become a celebrity. He is called Ari \"rice\" Pranchi by everybody, citing his ancestors' business as a colloquial taunt. He wants to change his image from Ari Pranchi to something great and is ready to spend a fortune for it. The film deals with how Pranchi tries to get a good name and what changes that brings to his life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8KYn9d4wY8VDQzVlmNv5FC6bytH.jpg", "actors": ["Mammootty (Pranckiyettan)", "Innocent (Vasu Menon)", "Ganapathi S Poduval (Pauly)", "Priyamani (Padmashree)", "Sasi Kalinga (Eeyyappan)", "Siddique (Dr Jose)", "Khushboo (Dr Omana)", "Jagathy Sreekumar (Pandit Deena Dayal)", "Balachandran Chullikkadu (Ajay Nambiar)", "Biju Menon (Joppan)", "Idavela Babu (Yousuf)", "Jesse Fox Allen (Saint Francis of Assisi)", "Ramu (Bahuleyan)", "Shivaji Guruvayoor (Antony Master)", "Sreejith Ravi (Vargeese)", "T G Ravi (Uthup)", "Jijoy Rajagopal (Ad film director)", "Tini Tom (Subran)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [79634, 237725, 215359, 135212], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
