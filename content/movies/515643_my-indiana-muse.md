Americana artist Robert Townsend would disagree. With an interest in vernacular photography\u2014in which amateur photographers shoot everyday images\u2014Robert finds some vacation slides and becomes creatively smitten with one lady who appears in numerous photos, whom he thinks has a \u201csuperstar quality.\u201d As he immortalizes her world in paintings that are outsized celebrations of the mid-century era, Townsend finds himself picking up clues and setting upon a quest to learn more about this happy mystery woman and her Kodacolor life. It\u2019s a gorgeous and fascinating film celebrating an incredibly talented artist and his middle-American muse in cat-eye glasses.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9kNn548K9RDQgIrm8jepNPtTUE.jpg", "actors": ["Cheryl Berea (Herself)", "Robert Townsend (Himself)", "Cheryl Berea ()", "Robert Townsend ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "EbBWyFwFE-o"}
