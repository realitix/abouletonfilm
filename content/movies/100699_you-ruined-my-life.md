Minerva gets into trouble a lot, and her Aunt Hermione threatens to take her away from Uncle Howie. Paul Reiser plays Dexter, a professor who figures out a way to win every time at blackjack. Dexter gets caught at cheating, and Uncle Howie works out a deal for Dexter to tutor Minerva so she can get into a private school back east. This is easier said than done, because Minerva has never been interested in school.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yIq1DO1vdPTirPHU7shyF6Dp7s6.jpg", "actors": ["Soleil Moon Frye (Minerva)", "Allen Garfield (Howie)", "Paul Reiser (Dexter Bunche)", "Mimi Rogers (Charlotte)", "Yoshi Hoover (Yaki)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
