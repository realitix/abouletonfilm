Among other talents, Mr. Price can throw two (and, in certain situations three) baseballs simultaneously to different people. The catchers can be side by side, with one high and one low, or standing on the pitcher's mound and second base while Price throws the ball from the catcher's position. He can even perform these feats while suspended upside-down.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/znokWmk2kCbA6cftqW8P3XUJJ0v.jpg", "actors": ["Pete Smith (Narrator (voice))", "Johnny Price (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
