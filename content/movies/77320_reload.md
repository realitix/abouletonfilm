Was it \u201cQueer Eye,\u201d \u201cBoy Meets Boy,\u201d Tab Hunter and Richard Chamberlain, or the fact that (as of this wiritng) Will Truman still doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend? Nope. Nada. Not a chance. The #1 story in gay entertainment for 2003 was the departure of John Rutherford from Falcon Studios and his purchase of Colt Studios. Now this was news! Why? Because the man who turned the Falcon image into an icon was moving to a studio whose equally iconic ideal was its polar opposite. Consider: The \u201cFalcon Man\u201d has only recently reached manhood. He\u2019s in his mid-20s at the most, with a flawless swimmer\u2019s build and a huge cock. The hair on his head is perfectly styled, and it\u2019s virtually the only hair on his body. When he wears anything, it\u2019s white Calvin Klein briefs, and he rarely shows much emotion during sex beyond the orgasmic groan. Think Tom Cruise and the cast of Top Gun.
