After 12 years, when the dust settles and resources start to dwindle, the starving people of Valanor cry out for peace, forcing the leaders of Tier, Sinnah, Daneth and Osgard to lay down their arms and meet each other at the negotiation table.  As each province prepares an envoy to find a diplomatic solution at the Kingdom's only neutral ground, an ancient and dark organization plots its return. Unbeknownst to the leaders of the four warring provinces this old enemy will stop at nothing to crush any hope of lasting peace.  Can the four envoys put their old hatreds aside and forge a bond of trust? Or will those that crave the blood and terror of war get their way?  Whatever the outcome, the fate of Valanor will be decided... at Bitter Lake.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/of5ZaQ8SSnldl8NzyqLzCwU2b9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
