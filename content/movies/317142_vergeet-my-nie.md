Stipulations for his parole are to stay out of trouble with the law, continue his studies at university and to come into contact with the rector on arriving on campus . Soon after his arrival he runs into Jan van Vollenhoven - the brother of the man he killed, which caused his jail sentence.  Van Vollenhoven promises to make life very difficult for him. He also attracts the unwanted attention of Briers and Schoeman, two students that have been trying to pass their third year without success and have earned bad reputations for fooling around rather than doing any studying.  He meets the lovely daughter of the rector and a special relationship soon develops between them. The rector, however, makes it clear that Preller is an unacceptable partner for his daughter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AiPsU0siJSPWcjoCeJObE0babsy.jpg", "actors": ["Hans Strydom (Dolf Preller)", "Alice Krige (Welma de Villiers)", "Cornelis Esterhuyse (Professor Mostert)", "Matt Hurter (Schoeman)", "Henk Wybenga (Briers)", "Willie Van Rensburg (van Greenen)", "Abri le Roux (Jan van Vollenhoven)", "Francois Stemmet (Johan de Villiers)", "Frank Zietsman (Professor de Villiers)", "Leonie Ross (Mrs. de Villiers)", "George Ballot (Goosen)", "Steve du Toit (Magistrate)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
