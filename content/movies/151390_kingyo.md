As they both walk through the streets of modern Tokyo, the man and the young woman gradually speak of a past they both share, and ultimately a painful love triangle that continues to haunt them. A poetic rumination in love, memories and loss told almost entirely with split screens.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zg2UUDkfo8XtWImdqrwg1IoMgPN.jpg", "actors": ["Luchino Fujisaki (Young Woman)", "Takao Kawaguchi (The Professor)", "Qyoko Kudo (Kyoko)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
