Max meets Elizabeth; they live together, but when she talks of marriage, he balks. He becomes extremely jealous, probably without cause, and thinks she's taken up with a friend of his, Jack. Elizabeth, stung by Max's refusal to marry, catches Jack's eye, but the friendship seems innocent. Lena, who works with Max, likes him and realizes she can manipulate his jealousy and maybe engineer his split from Elizabeth. When she's sure Elizabeth is with a man, she calls Max at work, sending him home to confront the lovers. Then, Lena feels guilty and takes off for Max's apartment. What's really going on? Who's with Elizabeth?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3MsbOTmpm0gC8dQYlZzaFvz0Qy.jpg", "actors": ["Drew Barrymore (Lena)", "Jennifer Beals (Elizabeth)", "Desiree Casado (Bonita)", "Mel Gorham (Lourdes)", "James Le Gros (Max)", "Andrew Marks (Partygoer)", "Jon Stewart (Henry)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [79876, 141996, 106973, 352037], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
