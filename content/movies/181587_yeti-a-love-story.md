Bad acting, directing, writing, everything... and not the enjoyable kind. The jokes are juvenile, the gore is of the red food coloring and Karo syrup variety. It's only 72 minutes (_72 minutes of my life I can never get back!_), but even that short running time was painful to sit through."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
