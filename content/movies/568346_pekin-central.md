Novice director Camille de Casabianca obtained permission from the authorities and set up her story around Valerie (Christine Citti), a woman who follows Yves (Yves Renier), the man she loves, to China. Yves is a journalist assigned to report on Western tourists behind the Bamboo Curtain, and it is an unintentionally comical group of tourists at that.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gF9lgqagSBZSW73FZINGQ7ePXC2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
