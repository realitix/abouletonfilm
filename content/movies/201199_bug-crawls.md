Accompanied by trademark dark ambient music, the short film ends with a close-up of the door opening, showing a lighted room with some kind of machinery on it, as the ambient sounds suggest a buzzing light and mechanical work.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m0lo5paUzr1XMlVyJDPd5zGxIdu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [368825, 108451, 271115, 210833], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
