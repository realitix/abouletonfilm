Why White People are Funny is an irreverent look at Western Civilization through Inuit eyes. Inspired by the satirical essays of Zebedee Nungak, the film turns the tables on generations of anthropologists, teachers, adventurers and administrators who went North to pursue their Arctic Dreams. Now it\u2019s their turn to be poked, prodded, examined and explained. A new generation of Inuit is ready to take on the Qalllunaat at their own game. Grounded in their own traditions but educated in the South, they have a unique perspective on the culture that has come to dominate the planet. And they are not afraid to speak their minds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3uWaaELrTwe0j64m1wvyCfIjE9n.jpg", "actors": ["John Amagoalik (John Amagoalik)", "Lori Idlout (Lori Idlout)", "Alexina Kublu (Alexina Kublu)", "Zebedee Nungak (Zebedee Nungak)", "Jeff Tabvahtah (Jeff Tabvahtah)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
