When DJ's equipment shorts out and Lonzo is cut out of the action by a record producer, the two join forces, which also requires a tentative peace between gangs. With backing from Gator, a smooth New Orleans drug king, DJ and Lonzo start dealing, organizing their gangs into pushers. Just as their finances are looking up, one of Gator's team pulls a double cross and two of DJ and Lonzo's gang bangers start a shooting war. Can the erstwhile music producers salvage anything of their bond or their plans?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8NNGZUxZ2WQfjPcpeZv8dMI5aRJ.jpg", "actors": ["Mack 10 (DJ)", "Fat Joe (Lonzo)", "Ice Cube (Slink)", "MC Eiht (Lil' Ant)", "CJ Mac (Gator)", "Big Pun (Punny)", "K-Mack (Tyree)", "Tom'ya Bowden (Leyla)", "Kidada Jones (Brandy)", "40 Glocc (Dog Fight Host)", "LaFaye Baker (Bitch)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
