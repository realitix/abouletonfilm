Despite their initial reservations, Yogi and Boo Boo take the bear cubs into their home and take care of them. Meanwhile, Jellystone Park has gone over budget and the park commissioner orders Ranger Smith to close it down. This means that Yogi, along with the other bears at the park, must be sent to a zoo. Because Yogi can't stand the thought of being cooped up in a zoo for the rest of his life, he hatches an elaborate escape plan. Salvaging car parts from a failed fishing expedition, he constructs a getaway \"Supercar,\" complete with a picnic basket rumble seat for the three orphaned cubs. Together they make their escape from the park to find a new home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wYWXzfwgCufpwLTvTZrunwjw2j2.jpg", "actors": ["Daws Butler (Yogi Bear / Snagglepuss / Quick Draw McGraw / Wally Gator)", "Don Messick (Boo Boo / Ranger Smith)", "Susan Blu ()", "William Callaway ()", "Hamilton Camp ()", "Dustin Diamond ()", "Pat Fraley ()", "Edan Gross ()", "Tress MacNeille ()", "Allan Melvin ()", "Scott Menville ()", "Josh Rodine ()", "Frank Welker ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [460803, 341986, 433387, 55571], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
