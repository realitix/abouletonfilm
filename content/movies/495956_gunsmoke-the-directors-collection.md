Fans of the long-running Western series will appreciate the archival care that went into this set: Not only does it provide a comprehensive overview of the series' evolution (from original radio shows to one-hour color episodes from the 1960s and '70s), but it also delivers a priceless abundance of oral TV history in the form of audio commentaries, some recorded by series stars and directors (like Dennis Weaver, a.k.a. \"Chester\") shortly before their death.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
