The anticipation of what the future holds. The untapped potential of what lies ahead. The finish line is only a starting point for a new adventure. What happens in between is where the real action is. Our mission is to document the future of mountain biking as it unfolds in real time. We capture the true lifestyle that intersects our lives as professional mountain bikers, builders and filmmakers, concocting a unique chemistry of filmic goodness. Many past films, riders, and locations have inspired us. Some of those locations are now our backyards, and some of those riders are now our friends. From the Inside Out is our adventure to the places we've always wanted to ride, and our expression of the lines and styles that have influenced us. This is freeride mountain biking. This film is from us \u2013 the riders.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vWQU7HaKBNfxC4VP6TErCvxwV7v.jpg", "actors": ["Curtis Robinson (Curtis Robinson)", "Dylan Dunkerton (Dylan Dunkerton)", "Brandon Semenuk (Brandon Semenuk)", "Matt Hunter (Matt Hunter)", "Graham Agassiz (Graham Agassiz)", "Mike Hopkins (Mike Hopkins)", "Brandon Semenuk ()", "Kenny Smith (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
