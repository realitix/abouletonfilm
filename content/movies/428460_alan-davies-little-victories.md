Following on from his impressive return to live stand-up, Life Is Pain, he immediately set about creating an even funnier, more personal and hilarious performance. This is classic stand-up from a master storyteller at the top of his game.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sSZ2V3rtCsHPEKPoo2FaLx6yJru.jpg", "actors": ["Alan Davies ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "BoKIgjV-d10"}
