It focuses on the North Western Canadian wilderness, however the issues are universal. The film engages hydro and natural gas energy executives, oil company reps, nuclear spokesmen, scientists, academics and activists in an intelligent debate that leaves the viewer to decide. The film presents a beautiful, thought provoking look at a rapidly transforming landscape.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nKBx44VaxR7ZNvHCxxBwIOE1adO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
