He was also the first star in history to make over one million dollars a movie, and even saved an entire studio from bankruptcy with one film. We will always remember Elvis the rebellious rock superstar, but we must also remember Elvis the Hollywood megastar, who continues to entertain his legions of fans to this day with his film roles. Elvis at the Movies is a look back at the man, the star, and the films that made Elvis Presley one of the biggest names in movie history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8Q5Ymn7xb3cwNRciEfKtiFadewO.jpg", "actors": ["Elvis Presley (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
