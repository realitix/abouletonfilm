Semon plays his default character, a grotesque hard-working incompetent. (I'm going to be using the word 'grotesque' a lot in this particular review.) This time round, he blunders into a boutique. After causing some damage he can't pay for, Larry is put to work as a general dogsbody. Mayhem ensues.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nSPeklHhvx8XcEDaDQ5Fbs4Fm6c.jpg", "actors": ["Larry Semon (Larry, a salesman)", "Oliver Hardy (Store manager)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
