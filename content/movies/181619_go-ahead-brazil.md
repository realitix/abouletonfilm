Under this context, Jofre Godoi da Fonseca, an alienated middle class man, is mistaken for Sarmento, a political activist he met at an airport prior to his assassination. He is then arrested and brutally tortured by a paramilitary group of vigilantes sponsored by influential businessmen to hunt down people deemed \"subversive\" by the regime.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hiDIJkyW3vD2JksGumQtC3zeAWt.jpg", "actors": ["Reginaldo Faria (Jofre God\u00f3i)", "Ant\u00f4nio Fagundes (Miguel God\u00f3i)", "Nat\u00e1lia do Vale (Marta God\u00f3i)", "Elizabeth Savalla (Mariana)", "Carlos Zara (Barreto)", "Cl\u00e1udio Marzo (Sarmento)", "Paulo Porto ()", "Ivan C\u00e2ndido ()", "Milton Moraes ()", "Neuza Amaral ()", "Irma \u00c1lvarez ()", "Fl\u00e1vio Migliaccio ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [80426, 42148], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
