Anxiety, paranoia, violence, and murder follows.  Sex, conspiracy and violence explode in GLASS, the second instalment of Vince D'Amato's neo-giallo series. Tirra Dent plays Zarana, a woman consumed by paranoia and rabid nightmares after she finds herself relentlessly stalked by the enigmatic killer. Set in the \"glass jungle\" of Vancouver's gentrified neighbourhoods, Glass is a scathing critique of social media and the society of middle and lower classes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mclE3h8qHoXM2ZfCMUa2LlHUZZ6.jpg", "actors": ["Tirra Dent (Zarana)", "Casey Manderson (Mike)", "Lesli Brownlee (Lacey)", "Benjamin Hanson (Blade)", "Jason Beaudoin (Isaac)", "Patrick Carr (Jacob)", "Stephanie Dyck (Robbie)", "Cynnamon Schreinert (Ginger)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
