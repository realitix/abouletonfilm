He dedicated his documentary debut to the speaker of these words, the Russian philosopher and religious thinker Alexey Fedorovich Losev (1893-1988), who died shortly after the completion of this film. Shot in black-and-white, the film consists of two crucial shots that symbolize silence and night at both ends of the life chain. In the beginning of the film, the rising sun slowly swathes a cemetery in daylight. At the end, the earth covers a coffin bit by bit and heralds the great darkness. In Losev's words, \"Divine intentions that lie beyond our reason, that's why we die.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7yZiDmilzwpSj8KkbMDKkwmeFQ2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
