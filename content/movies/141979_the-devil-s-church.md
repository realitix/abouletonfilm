He meets Frau Ane, Asmus' wife; Ane yearns to have a baby but in vain so the devil takes advantage of Frau Ane's motherly inner desire by making a deal with her but for his own purposes. As a result, the farmer's wife comes under the devil's spell and then seduces the local priest, giving the devil to chance to build his own church to replace the old church that has burned down.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bY1G2l4eidmmMycgkOgw0lePXz9.jpg", "actors": ["Hans Mierendorff (Pfarrer)", "Agnes Straub (Ane)", "Paul Rehkopf (The Devil)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
