One of them is 78-year-old Denzo, whose son and his wife consider him senile. Left alone, he befriends a young boy, Sentaro, who has heard that the old man was once a great angler. The unlikely pair spend lots of happy time together, until Denzo has a heart attack and dies far upstream. The dam is completed and the entire area is inundated. Everyone will move away, except Denzo.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z4cr5DzbB2fk9UQyVrZTpNXoNrf.jpg", "actors": ["Yoshi Kat\u00f4 (Denzo)", "Hiroyuki Nagato (Denroku)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
