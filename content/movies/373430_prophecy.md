This one is a short documentary about the 1945 atomic bombing and its devastating consequences. The film came out of the \"10 Foot Movement\". A movement organized by the Japan Peace Museum, which mobilized Japanese citizen activists to buy back small segments of film footage of the effects of the atomic bomb from the U.S. National Archives. The film combines recent footage of survivors of the atomic bomb with American archival footage, portraying the sorrow of atomic bomb survivors in the cold war period.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kdAZpsZFSUi4SbOzK6y0psarpfq.jpg", "actors": ["Donald Knode (Narrator)", "Dan Caughlin (News Announcer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
