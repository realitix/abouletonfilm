The grandson of a Chinese railroad laborer embarks on a romantic, but ultimately doomed, quest to save this railroad from being sold for scrap. His love of trains finds him working as a railroad-man, instead of at his father's profitable business. He manages to locate a wealthy eccentric investor to help him acquire the railroad, but its financial inviability makes this a quixotic reprieve, at best. The film also portrays the anti-Asian racism present in America at the conclusion of World War II.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9Cv06T3VAOXKv0LvTmGkEZPuOHC.jpg", "actors": ["Jeri Arredondo (Nancy)", "Henry Gibson (Albert Robinson)", "Michael Stipe (Skeeter)", "Alexandra Bokyun Chun (Angela)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
