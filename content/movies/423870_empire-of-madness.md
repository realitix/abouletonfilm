Instead, the first half is a compilation of faux-snuff vignettes akin to something you\u2019d find in a SOV horror collection like Snuff Perversions 1 &amp; 2, Snuff Files, The Dead Files, Violations I &amp; II, or even more recent titles like Murder Collection Volume 1. The second half is in turn a send-up of satanic panic style videos like Law Enforcement Guide to Satanic Cults, Devil Worship: The Rise Of Satanism, and countless others shat out during the 80s/90s. The vignettes are hilariously inept to the point where it seems clear that Causey was parodying the shockumentary form. Even the credits are a joke, mocking the seriousness with which shocku producers take themselves, crediting a \u2018researcher\u2019 for a film that clearly had none, and a \u2018visual archivist\u2019 being listed in place of a cameraman.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4pMgFt6ibcOYjciQEQRFwBdNLlB.jpg", "actors": ["Paula Wilson ()", "Zodia ()", "George Montgomery ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
