Surgal pays close attention to the Art Ensemble of Chicago, Albert Ayler, Eric Dolphy, Sam Rivers, Sun Ra & His Arkestra, and, of course, the recently deceased piano genius Cecil Taylor. Filled with priceless archival footage and photographs, Fire Music is a fittingly wild and freeform tribute to music that makes your hair stand on end.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/polpaEFNQnihvh1w1fgPSeE5N6d.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
