She hears a noise in the other room, and thinking that it's Father Christmas, she goes to investigate. Instead she finds one of the monsters from her book, who has come to find someone to help defeat an evil witch that has stolen the voices of all monsters; because they sang better at Christmas carols than she did. The little girl agrees to help, and armed with the contents of her Christmas stocking sets out on a surreal, imaginative, electronically sounded, novelly avant-garde, one-of-a-kind, brain-tickling, foam-monster populated outdoor fantasy adventure through smoky fields, magical forests, boiling, bubbling mud pools, volcanic landscapes and secret witch mountain cave lairs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jZ1iJrTS4Mg5Bl1bUuJb0ltD2d0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
