Others say that Lublae is a derivative of Lublang, the name of the forest in the area. 'Lang' means 'evening' in the language of Lanna (an old kingdom in present day northern Thailand) as the forest was so dense it often got dark before sunset. Legend has it that the residents of Lublae were all women and that they tolerated no lies, no matter how small.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pJWQqiAkHHzaFnSfK2BZWc7WcRJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
