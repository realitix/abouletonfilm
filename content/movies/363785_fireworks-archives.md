Passages of blackness sporadically dissolve under the fitful internal illumination of sparklers, which light up to reveal Sulilat\u2019s unorthodox temple populated with a fantastical concrete menagerie of beasts and figures; the sculptures range from the broad, whale-like contours of a frog\u2019s face, to a cavalcade of dogs on mopeds, to a pair of skeletons partially embracing as if sitting for a double portrait. These images are interspersed with those of an older Thai couple mysteriously wandering around the temple like wraiths, the woman\u2019s plodding progress hampered by the use of crutches.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cM9k2yzQcvI45ugQgL1NfxphM7r.jpg", "actors": ["Jenjira Pongpas ()", "Banlop Lomnoi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "VKu8aQAwH9c"}
