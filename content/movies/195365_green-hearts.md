The three friends love the freedom of their jobs, but should have started careers years ago. Grandpa and Dingo are in steady relationships. Epo is a swinging single, to the jealous chagrin of his two pals. Nobody picks up the best-looking receptionists in town like Epo - before he meets Cecilie, that is.

They are turning over a new leaf, but is it really what they are after?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bMhKcVsBFZNvsB5waEkcTAVpmcB.jpg", "actors": ["Laura Bach ()", "Hassan Preisler ()", "David Rousing ()", "Christine Albeck B\u00f8rge ()", "Stanislav Sevcik ()", "Marina Bouras ()", "Lisa M.
