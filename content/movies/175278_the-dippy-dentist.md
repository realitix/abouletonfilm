Several guys all come to her to pledge their undying love--including Harold Lloyd's brother, Gaylord (who is a dentist). Shortly after this, a new dentist (Snub Pollard) arrives to work in an office across the hall. In a very funny scene, Pollard manages to steal all of Gaylord's patients from his waiting room. However, when it comes to dental work, Snub is highly unlikely to receive the American Dental Association's seal of approval. That's because he's incredibly rough and manages to toss a guy out the window when he pulls his tooth.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["'Snub' Pollard (The Dandy)", "Marie Mosquini (Fifi Flannigan)", "Sunshine Sammy Morrison (Messenger Boy)", "Sammy Brooks (A Patient)", "Gaylord Lloyd (Dentist)", "William Gillespie (Cop)", "Wallace Howe (Patient in waiting room)", "Charles Stevenson (Jewish Bootlegger)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
