Hexagonal refractions and spectral rays puncture alluded-to landscapes - rivers, skies, prairies, trees, mountains. Graphic (yet spatially free-floating) imagery slices intently wrought rhythms of light and dark color fields, producing afterimages. The film concludes with bright, almost-discernible window shapes, hinting at an opening to a different realm.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y0mbVPrdyye8h8QGvmuhcFh6Eej.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
