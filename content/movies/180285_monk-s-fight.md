He and the film's producers seem to be paying homage to Toshiro Mifune, Clint Eastwood, Jimmy Wang Yu et al. Casa is very much the taciturn, serious lone man on a mission. He is always focussed, apparently calm, until he explodes into action.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bPSbdUDreDgbjJMDJZmtUpf1MXb.jpg", "actors": ["Chang Ling ()", "Ling Yun ()", "Casanova Wong ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
