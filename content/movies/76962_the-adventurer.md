The hero of the title, Toomas Nipernaadi (Tonu Kark) is first seen roaming the rural landscape, going from village to village looking for the woman of his dreams. He wears a bedraggled white suit but generously pays for any lodging he needs or in one case, even buys a farm. Nipernaadi has a way with words and enchants those he meets with his wild stories about himself. Women find him appealing and the men are entertained as he moves from one locale to the next. But his idyll looks like it will end -- at least for awhile -- when his wife shows up in an expensive car and explains exactly what has been going on.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oq3CGasr9tmMUv3KBRtTVJ0x9bS.jpg", "actors": ["T\u00f5nu Kark (Toomas Nipernaadi)", "Viire Valdma (Milla)", "Paul Poom (Peetrus)", "Egon Nuter (Paulus)", "Margus Oopkaup (Joonatan)", "Ain Lutsepp (Jaan L\u00f5oke)", "J\u00fcri J\u00e4rvet (Siimon Vaa)", "Kaie Mihkelson (Inriid)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [76989, 47150, 46860, 46894], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
