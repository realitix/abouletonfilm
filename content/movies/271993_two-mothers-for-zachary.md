Appalled by the fact that Jody has come out of the closet and is living in an openly gay relationship with her female lover, Jody's mother Nancy sues to gain custody of her grandson Zachary. A homophobic judge arranges for Zachary to be taken out of Jody's home, whereupon Nancy sets about to thoroughly wipe her grandson's memory clean of his previous \"immoral\" lifestyle--even unto demanding that the boy refer to her as Momma. The film's script is careful to weigh both sides of the argument equally, demonstrating that for most of her life, Jody was hardly a paragon of responsible motherhood, having supped full of booze and promiscuity before realizing she was gay and promptly cleaning herself up; nor is Nancy depicted as a cold-hearted villain, merely a concerned grandmother who wants what she thinks is best for Zachary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fcvD7OXU2uySXq42n0lHOmqdE4R.jpg", "actors": ["Valerie Bertinelli ()", "Vanessa Redgrave ()", "Colleen Flynn ()", "James Gammon ()", "Michael Marich ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
