He soon finds himself alone when his co-workers go to the beach and never return. Society becomes a stranger and his imagination becomes his only friend. He dials a random number and a romantic conversation about loneliness and the absurdity of reality ensues. His world starts acquiring meaning as he realizes part-time-singer monkeys are running the show.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m72QpLn64RVOK4bC8zTWxPneGcH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
