Filled with a cast of unforgettable characters, Twelfth Night combines cruelty with high comedy and the pangs of unrequited love with some of the subtlest poetry and most exquisite songs Shakespeare ever wrote.  The Globe revisits its award-winning Twelfth Night of 2002 with an all-male Original Practices production, exploring clothing, music, dance and settings possible in the Globe of around 1601.  Mark Rylance reprises his performance of Olivia in Twelfth Night, 10 years after its original premiere at Middle Temple Hall and The Globe.  Synopsis  In the household of Olivia, two campaigns are being quietly waged - one by the lovesick lord Orsino against the heart of the indifferent Olivia; the other by an alliance of servants and hangers-on against the high-handedness of her steward, the pompous Malvolio. When Orsino engages the cross-dressed Viola to plead with Olivia on his behalf, a bittersweet chain of events follows.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pOgTDRIqize2aL3ggE7J5Gpcdsu.jpg", "actors": ["Stephen Fry (Malvolio)", "Paul Chahidi (Maria)", "Samuel Barnett (Sebastian)", "Liam Brennan (Orsino)", "John Paul Connolly (Antonio)", "James Garnon (Fabian)", "Peter Hamilton Dyer (Feste)", "Colin Hurley (Sir Toby Belch)", "Mark Rylance (Olivia)", "Ian Drysdale (Priest / Valentine)", "Johnny Flynn (Viola)", "Jethro Skinner (Captain)", "Ben Thompson (Curio)", "Roger Lloyd Pack (Sir Andrew)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "Tomasina", "content": "Absolutely sensational.\r\nThe play is done just like it was when it was created by The Bard - men playing the female roles and -what a treat- Mark Rylance as Olivia.\r\nThe exciting cast includes Stephen Fry and Paul Chahidi, who makes good on his reputation as a \"scene stealer.\"\r\nThe late 16th Century text is not a barrier here, it is enjoyable and easy to follow.\r\nThose who want to explore further may want to look up the great Mark Rylance and his reasons for signing the Declaration of Reasonable Doubt."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
