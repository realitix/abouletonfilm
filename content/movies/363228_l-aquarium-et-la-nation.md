This is all from a film by Jean-Marie Straub \u2013 about fate, the soul and the cosmos, about the evident nature in which man lives, just like in the aquarium surrounding him. And finally, there\u2019s the nation as a symbol for the community of free people. A Straub film represents a gift that isn\u2019t based on exchange, but rather the opposite of communication. And what could be more beautiful and liberating in life?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ak2VBAhinJuV4bZAM2KdQSr0SRy.jpg", "actors": ["Aim\u00e9 Agnel ()", "Christiane Veschambre ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
