Fired up on a diet of bagels, the climbers, Rich and Neil, set off to do battle with the dizzying exposure and raking crack lines of this historic face. The ensuing agony is captured in this spectacularly shot film, that exudes passion and humour and takes a refreshingly honest look at living 6 days in the vertical world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jLGOhAxONEtbFll4QnFmWyKG2Sv.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Heap (Himself)", "Neil Bentley (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
