Leon (Stavros Xenides) and Zaharoula (Betty Livanou) are heading out for their annual vacation at a summer resort. Instead of their usual carefree anticipation, their mood is subdued because their daughter has just married and is off on her honeymoon. Life is lonely without her and the couple cannot avoid the realization that death is not that far away for them. Once at the resort, Leon tries to overcome this nagging fear by taking a wild plunge in the ocean, naked, as he and Zaharoula are out walking on the beach. Taken up in the spirit of the moment, she joins him among the waves. The results, however, are not what they expected.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cv8tp6TkrFotGgIlpaUcsgcj7kG.jpg", "actors": ["Stavros Xenidis ()", "Betty Livanou ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
