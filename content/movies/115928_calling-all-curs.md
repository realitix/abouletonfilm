When dognappers posing as reporters (Lynton Brent, Cy Schindell) dognap the poodle, the boys frantically try to trick Mrs. Bedford by disguising a mutt as Gar\u00e7on. However, when Mrs. Bedford's maid (Libby Taylor), who is frightened of dogs, accidentally vacuums a clump of glued-on fur off the mutt's shaggy coat, Mrs. Bedford threatens to throw the Stooges in jail. Desperate, the trio use the mutt as a bloodhound to track down the crooks. When they discover the enemies' hideout, a big fight ensues. Larry and Moe get knocked out, but then Curly defeats both crooks. The boys hear Gar\u00e7on quietly barking from inside a closet, only to discover that the prized poodle has had a litter of pups.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fVCrpdZTlhOtAu2BaZk0XB63vku.jpg", "actors": ["Curly Howard (Dr. Curly)", "Larry Fine (Larry)", "Moe Howard (Moe)", "Lynton Brent (Duke - Dognapper (uncredited))", "Robin Raymond (Nurse (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [115919, 115991, 115934, 115992], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
