What makes this little film fascinating is it was one of the earliest color broadcasts on television and happily is one of the few early color productions for TV that can be seen in color now. Early color television productions seem to have had a limited color capability much like the early 1930's attempts at Technicolor. This actually adds to the charm of this little Christmas story giving in an \"old time\" feel.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nyFXuyTE5KS8YnDxV1dLgCnjhIS.jpg", "actors": ["Louis Jourdan (Antique Shop Owner)", "Ellen-Cobb Hill (Marilyn)", "Margaret Hamilton (Mrs. Loomis)", "Elaine Lynn (Barbara May)", "Christine Lynn (Barbara's Sister)", "Mary Michael (Mrs. Anderson)", "David Orrick McDearmon (Mr. Stark)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "JHC1M9d-PZY"}
