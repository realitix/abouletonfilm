Notable leaders are traditionally honored while commonfolk and enemies are suggested through animals - dutiful horses in old wartime, meek puppies 'neath the Provisional Government and suffocative ravens at the dawn of WWII. A love letter to the capital indeed, To You Moscow also functions as a quickie review of Russian history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/85rSdVpFLeTqZol2BiSSY5ADoPO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
