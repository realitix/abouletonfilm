Excitement of discovery, hope and disappointment, competition and recognition are shown from an infinitely close distance. Scientists united by the idea of discretization, which, in short, means: constructing continuous objects from basic building blocks. Akin to the scientists' search for the right discretization of continuum, this film itself is composed of fragments - individual characters of different ages, temperaments and scientific approaches - which form a single continuous melody. The question of where the boundaries lie between mathematics and the lives of those who are involved in it and how much they are willing to sacrifice is as important as the search for precise scientific answers. A unique and unprecedented dive into the unknown world of mathematicians.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rR5eHqTwPTRCrPoInx5GowJEFk1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
