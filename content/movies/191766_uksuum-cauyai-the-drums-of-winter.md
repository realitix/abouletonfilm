The film was produced through a \"community-collaborative process\" in which the subjects of the documentary had significant input as to the film's content and presentation. As a result, the film features conversations with individual Yup'ik in place of \"the voice-over commentary by an unseen narrator that destroys the cinematic integrity of so many so-called ethnographic films\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9OobPyvi5AouTq61gz6dbDRA9Ay.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
