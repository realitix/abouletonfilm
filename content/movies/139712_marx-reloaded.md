The crisis triggered the deepest global recession in 70 years and prompted the US government to spend more than 1 trillion dollars in order to rescue its banking system from collapse. Today the full implications of the crisis in Europe and around the world still remain unclear. Nevertheless, should we accept the crisis as an unfortunate side-effect of the free market? Or is there another explanation as to why it happened and its likely effects on our society, our economy and our whole way of life?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iTLLleOEigNuXpsMs9YvRgH1suE.jpg", "actors": ["Jason Barker (Karl Marx (voice))", "Michael Hardt (Himself)", "Antonio Negri (Himself)", "Ivan Nikoli\u0107 (Leon Trotsky (voice))", "Nina Power (Herself)", "Jacques Ranci\u00e8re (Himself)", "Peter Sloterdijk (Himself)", "Alberto Toscano (Himself)", "Slavoj \u017di\u017eek (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
