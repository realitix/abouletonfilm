A sonic rollercoaster of aggressive music in odd meter, subtle parts and melancholic beauty, building suspense and abrupt stops, with a wondrous interplay of sounds, this visual presentation is definitely not for the faint-hearted", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rm1FoZaPVESd1KvM2dNvFlFwWGN.jpg", "actors": ["Linus Kase (Himself)", "Linus Kase (himself)", "Jonas Engdegard (Himself)", "Anna Holmgren (Herself)", "Tord Lindman (Himself)", "Johan Brand (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
