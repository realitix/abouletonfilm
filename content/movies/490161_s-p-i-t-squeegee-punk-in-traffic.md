As part of the filmmaking process, he's been given a camera to document his world. The footage he gets is urgent, because there's a war against squeegee kids. This documentary is from the point of view of the kids themselves, in order to provide alternative voices. Roach's camera is positioned behind \"enemy\" lines: living in derelict buildings, squeegeeing for money, being hunted by police.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Eric Denis (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
