Along the way, they stop and collect memories, meeting up with old friends, lovers, and a daughter who\u2019s pregnant. She\u2019s involved with a former NBA star who is not the father. Seems like everyone they\u2019ve ever known is in a non-traditional relationship, which makes the would-be divorcees look pretty normal. I\u2019m an admitted fan of Richard Dreyfuss (and it\u2019s not just because I\u2019ve been told I look a bit like him). The way this film was directed made it feel like an off-Broadway play. It was fun to watch. Don\u2019t expect anything profound, just light entertainment."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "qrPkgb-s4N0"}
