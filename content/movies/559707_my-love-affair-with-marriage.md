Her experiences transform her from a fiery young girl craving love to a domestic abuse victim and eventually lead to her discovery of gender fluidity, self-acceptance, and finding a better place in society. The singing Mythology Sirens and her own Biology are characters that influence her, showing how our relationship roles are shaped by both the stereotypes of our cultures and the neuroscience of our own bodies.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Dagmara Domi\u0144czyk (Zelma)", "Michele Pawk (Biology)", "Matthew Modine (Bo)", "Cameron Monaghan (Sergei)", "Stephen Lang (Jonas)", "Erica Schroeder (Elita)", "Emma Kenney (Sarma)", "Anna O'Donoghue (Teacher #1)", "Tanya Franks (Teacher #2)", "Clyde Baldo (Eduards)", "Najla Said (New Girl)", "Keith Randolph Smith (Man on Train)", "Dan Domingues (Lauris)", "Florencia Lozano (Zelma's Mother)", "Ruby Modine (Nina)", "Carolyn Baeumler (Darya)", "Christina Pumariega (Darya's Mother)", "Tracy Thorne (Master of Ceremonies #1)", "Laila Robins (Master of Ceremonies #2)", "Cindy Cheung (Velta)", "Dale Soules (Official)", "Jennifer Dorr White (Pastor)", "Brian Dykstra (Estonian #1)", "Andrew Garman (Estonian #2)", "Michael Laurence (Big Man)", "Sturgis Warner (Big Man's Friend)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
