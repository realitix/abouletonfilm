As a young porn actor he was known as a \u201cjuice\u201d man for his ability to produce photogenic amounts of seminal fluid on cue. That would be quite enough success for most young men, but like so many actors before him, Ono is earnest in his desire to direct. Tonight he will get chance on Japan\u2019s notorious Paradise TV, an insane 24 hour-a-day sex channel on Tokyo television.  Honeymoon is a documentary on life behind the scenes at Paradise TV, where the realms of capitalism, culture and commerce intertwine. Slovenian director Dra\u017een \u0160tader and his cameras are provided rare access to the inner workings and politics of this strange sex business.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tWg7f5BMKqc9qk2GxZGYi7P8lXC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
