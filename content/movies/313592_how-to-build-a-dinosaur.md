So how do we turn a pile of broken bones into a dinosaur exhibit? Dr Alice Roberts finds out how the experts put skeletons back together, with muscles, accurate postures, and even - in some cases - the correct skin color. Here's a conundrum. Most dinosaur skeletons are incomplete, so how do you create museum exhibits that are realistic? As Dr Alice Roberts discovers, it's a practical question for those putting together an exhibition at LA County's Natural History Museum, who have to design dynamic, punter-pleasing displays that also reflect the latest thinking in paleontology circles.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nY9sFLgpnB4L2hQOwS7izrRBLPk.jpg", "actors": ["Alice Roberts (Herself - Presenter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
