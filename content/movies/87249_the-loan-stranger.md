He tries to get a loan on it from a nearby wolf. The wolf agrees to give Woody the loan but exclaims if he doesn't receive payment in thirty days, he'll take Woody's car away. Sure enough, a title card tells us, \"Thirty days have elapsed (and so has Woody's memory)\". The wolf appears at Woody's door trying to serve him with a notice but the crafty woodpecker pretends he's not home. The wolf tries to trap him disguised as a deliveryman giving Woody a cake... but the woodpecker throws it in his face bellowing, \"I don't like cheesecake!\" Finally, the fox throws a punch at Woody and believes to have seriously injured him. He sympathetically agrees to forget about the loan only to be infuriated when Woody \"recovers\" holding a cuckoo clock and asking, \"How about a loan on the clock, Doc?\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cNeQW3Qebc8KIfXAK3pZq9tRaO1.jpg", "actors": ["Mel Blanc (Woody Woodpecker (archive sound))", "Kent Rogers (Woody Woodpecker)", "Harold Peary (Hudson C.
