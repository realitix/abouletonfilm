Two watchers at the wake are smoking and drinking, while the widow is weeping over the coffin. The attention of the three is attracted for an instant, and the supposed corpse rises up, drinks all the beer in the pitcher which is standing on a table nearby, and lies down in the coffin again. The mourners return, and seeing that the beer is gone, engage in a controversy over it. During the scrap the corpse jumps out of the coffin and takes part in the melee.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/29ENVLHWpVkLWfDG4tjIwKoKYpf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
