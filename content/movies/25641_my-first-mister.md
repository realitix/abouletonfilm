Albert Brooks plays a man who is her total opposite, a precise and well-ordered menswear store owner of forty-nine who manages limited expectations and protects lonely secrets with pleasant ritual and quiet, ironic reserve. These two total opposites collide in conflict then come together in a surprising alliance, changing each other's lives forever.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uTeM8PA8eawwxcJskcvkmhMID8Z.jpg", "actors": ["Albert Brooks (Randall)", "Leelee Sobieski (Jennifer)", "John Goodman (Benjamin)", "Carol Kane (Mrs. Benson)", "Desmond Harrington (Randy)", "Natasha Braisewell (Girl in Vintage)", "Henry Brown (Jack Taylor - Salesman)", "Michael McKean (Bob)", "Rutanya Alda (Woman at Apartment)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [18408, 39497, 42176, 11855], "youtube_key": "E24SGpVrs-s"}
