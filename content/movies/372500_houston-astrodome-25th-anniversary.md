The Astrodome revolutionized baseball and the game hasn't been the same since. Take a fun look back at the early years. Relive the excitement of the 1980 and '86 playoff series, then review the 1989 season as the Astros' young guns came of age, ready for the 1990s.  All of these moments and more are captured in this video tribute to the Astros and their 25 years in the \"Eight Wonder of the World.\" Written and produced by Houston sports journalist and Astros broadcaster Bruce Gietzen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dHmuVYroaWImVgGxv8j2fMM5x4G.jpg", "actors": ["Bruce Gietzen (Narrator)", "Larry Dierker (Himself)", "Norm Miller (Himself)", "Bob Aspromonte (Himself)", "Harry Craft (Himself)", "Jimmy Wynn (Himself)", "Art Howe (Himself)", "Greg Gross (Himself)", "Craig Reynolds (Himself)", "Jim Deshaies (Himself)", "Mike Scott (Himself)", "Glenn Davis (Himself)", "Dave Smith (Himself)", "Kevin Bass (Himself)", "Gerald Young (Himself)", "Rafael Ramirez (Himself)", "Ken Caminiti (Himself)", "Mark Portugal (Himself)", "Craig Biggio (Himself)", "Yogi Berra (Himself)", "Eric Anthony (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
