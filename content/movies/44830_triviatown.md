Eight questions per hour are asked over 90FM, the student radio station at the University of Wisconsin - Stevens Point, for 54 hours straight. This film highlights several trivia teams and how very differently they play the contest from the more serious teams to the teams who just get together to party. For most teams, Trivia is like an annual reunion where they can get together with family and friends and have fun doing something they all love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ePBrNnNbpS72e2aZpQEYenkm7QP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
