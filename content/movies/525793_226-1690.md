Together with the accompanying visuals of scenes shot from the windows of the filmmaker\u2019s New York loft, the recordings provide an amusing account of life caught between the public and the private; we see weddings take place in the church across the street, passersby struggling through the snow on the sidewalk, and gradually become submerged in the meditative rhythms of Rogers\u2019s interior world.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
