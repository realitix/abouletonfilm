With a population of over a billion, India has recently enjoyed an economic boom and its movie stars are treated like deities. Today their fame stretches across the diaspora, in what has become a truly global industry.  As Indian cinema celebrates its centenary, Sanjeev Bhaskar travels across the subcontinent to get under the skin of the Indian movie business as never before.  From young hopefuls in the slums of Mumbai to superstars like Kareena Kapoor and Aamir Khan, he meets the stars of the silver screen and the people behind the scenes - legendary producers, directors, musicians and choreographers - exploring the stories behind some of the greatest films ever made.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/12xagR1v1VJurvwfTrxg3RqwSyK.jpg", "actors": ["Sanjeev Bhaskar (Presenter)", "Javed Akhtar (Himself)", "Shabana Azmi (Herself)", "Asha Bhosle (Herself)", "Anupama Chopra (Herself)", "Vidhu Vinod Chopra (Himself)", "Rana Daggubati (Himself)", "Shiamak Davar (Himself)", "Kareena Kapoor Khan (Herself)", "Siddharth Roy Kapur (Himself)", "Anurag Kashyap (Himself)", "Aamir Khan (Himself)", "Saif Ali Khan (Himself)", "P.K.
