The doctor just replies that the problem can be solved by R20. R20 is played fabulously by Dimitris Starovas. He is a former psychologist (now operating his father's import export meat business) that uses company trucks as moving brothels. R20 actually stands for: \"Russian 20 years old\" which eventually means that Lakis Lazopoulos has to cheat on his wife to solve his problem.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eV6YFTV2Dj1iqmoix46wrVYGkU8.jpg", "actors": ["Lakis Lazopoulos (Fotis)", "Vassilis Haralambopoulos (Ilias)", "Tania Tripi (Foteini)", "Tzeni Mpotsi (Nina)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
