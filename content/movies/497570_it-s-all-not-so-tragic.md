He\u2019s had mental problems ever since the day he ruined his chance at being a DVD commentator. During the featurette for a favorite noir classic, he committed an unspeakable, unnatural act. Now his shrink is suggesting he take a small vacation to get away from it all. Running out of gas, Connor comes across a fallen crossing guard, a psychotic with a pick axe, a young lady named Distosia, who is studying to be part of a cult, one of his favorite soap stars, and a young man he once photographed in the nude. All of this leads to a kind of psychotic breakdown where Connor\u2019s sexual dysfunction manifests itself in more and more bizarre ways. Eventually, there\u2019s nothing left to do but dance and sing. Besides, life\u2019s not too bad when you think about it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4VL60HbKuu4n9pv3pSyzYGEVthd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
