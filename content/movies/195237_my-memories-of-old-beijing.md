The film shows the society and the miserable life of the people in the 1920s in Beijing through the eyes of a naive girl. The film is uniquely arranged. Instead of organizing the plot with a beginning, development, climax and conclusion, it features a keynote of sorrows and yearning for the past and a string-styled plot that links three separate stories. Like a multifaceted mirror, it reflects the historical scenes from different angles. The film has its content centering on the characters\u2019 psychology and supplemented with music; an artistic form of expression featuring a gentle rhythm, symbolism, implication, comparison, and repetition; and a tranquil, concise conception similar to a Chinese wash drawing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zDxnoWxla09Zzw6DFsf4nMttH9O.jpg", "actors": ["Shen Jie (Xia Yingzi)", "Zheng Zhenyao (Ma Song)", "Zhang Min (Xiuzhen)", "Yan Xiang ()", "Yan Qin (Ma Song's Nephew)", "Rong Hong ()", "Yuan Jiayi ()", "Xu Caigen (Daming Feng)", "Zhang Fengyi (Thief)", "Wenping Chong ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [224961, 168751], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
