Narrated by Dawn French, the programme includes interviews with many of the comedians and musicians who took part: John Cleese, Stephen Fry, Michael Palin, Sting, Lenny Henry and many more. The shows and their stars had a huge effect on modern British comedy. There are few comics today whose careers have not been heavily influenced by the anarchic and surreal humour of these events.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zKnULBxcJi8ouqmEU4NtAWJNhj9.jpg", "actors": ["Rowan Atkinson (Himself)", "Michael Palin (Himself)", "Dawn French (Herself - Narrator)", "Jennifer Saunders (Herself)", "Stephen Fry (Himself)", "John Cleese (Himself)", "Sting (Himself)", "Peter Cook (Himself)", "Graham Chapman (Himself)", "Terry Jones (Himself)", "Terry Gilliam (Himself)", "Hugh Laurie (Himself)", "Billy Connolly (Himself)", "Alan Bennett (Himself)", "Barry Humphries (Himself - Edna Everage)", "Jonathan Lynn (Himself)", "Connie Booth (Herself)", "Neil Innes (Himself)", "Pete Townshend (Himself)", "Bob Geldof (Himself)", "Alexei Sayle (Himself)", "Phil Collins (Himself)", "John Williams (Himself)", "Ruby Wax (Herself)", "Jimmy Mulville (Himself)", "Lenny Henry (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
