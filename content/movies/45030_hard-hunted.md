These are pretty awful movies with barely existent nonsensical plots whose only purpose is to display an extreme amount of either completely unnecessary nudity or \"WTF are they wearing?!?\" swimsuits. So bad and yet so hilarious.\r\n\r\nThe one saving grace for the series, at least for the movies we've watched so far, is that the women are definitely in charge. They're the brains while most of the men are inept meatheads. Definitely a Charlie's Angels kind of vibe.\r\n\r\nAnother bonus for this movie: Al Leong! And he has an actual big role with lines!"}], "recommandations_id": [45029, 58984, 28135, 49983]}
