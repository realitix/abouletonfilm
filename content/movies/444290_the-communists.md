Out-of-work steelworker-turned- radical revolutionary Joe Starkhill and his band of comrades seize the Town Hall and take the Mayor, her driver, a security guard and a civil servant hostage - declaring the start of a socialist revolution in Britain. But when a faulty phone line prevents them from alerting the local newspaper and TV station, and the police write them off as a hoax, it is only when one of the hostages fails to return home for dinner, that the alarm is raised and Inspector John Machin is dispatched to the Town Hall to investigate - but it's not long before the building is surrounded by the press, police and public, turning Starkhill and the Revolutionaries into a media sensation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h2uk5rd3H4s8L4pqZzglwyhv4t4.jpg", "actors": ["William Fox (Inspector John Machin)", "Richard Galloway (Comrade Robbie Roy Galloway)", "Thanasis Manitarellis (Comrade Dean Mavros)", "Simon Moore (Sergeant Simon Sergeant)", "James Osman (Comrade George Jimi Hamilton)", "Simon Moore (Sergeant Steve Sergeant)", "James Underwood (Comrade Anthony Navarro)", "David Kendra (News Presenter)", "Andre Gwilliam (Civil Servant)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
