Contrary to popular belief, no film footage of the detonation exists and would have been impossible to witness. To complete the historic record, WWII historian Martin Morgan guides a Hollywood production team on a mission to reveal this horrific event in a way never seen before. To get the story right, the team heads to Japan on a site survey visiting the peace memorial, and survivors give a tour of the past destruction. To understand the science behind the bomb, they even create their own explosion. With these key ingredients, Martin Morgan's vision comes to life and one of the most important events of WWII is revealed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w73zmmqdr7nWMYV1rj5ituRWgB3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
