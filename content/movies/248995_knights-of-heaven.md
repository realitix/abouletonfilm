The fate of humanity depends on their success. The rules of the mission require the death of each participant once his or her task is accomplished. After killing one of their colleagues and splitting into several groups, the alpinists continue their journey. But the human unconscious doesn\u2019t follow military orders. Having once committed murder, the \u201cknights\u201d can\u2019t control their desire to kill. They forgot their mission\u2026 and kill each other instead. \u2014University of Pittsburgh", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cfwDquXczvEHP0AaKOnGgbKau3U.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
