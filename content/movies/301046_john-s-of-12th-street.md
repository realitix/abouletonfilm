This observational documentary loosely follows the rhythm of the restaurant\u2019s day, which swings between boredom and frenzy as the old rooms empty and fill. No one who works at John\u2019s is actually Italian, but some have been here for 40 years, including two pairs of brothers and a father and son. JOHN\u2019S OF 12TH STREET catalogues the overlooked details of working life and a vanishing facet of New York City.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6cXQPj8EGCj71CoUZCfDmgwLpEl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
