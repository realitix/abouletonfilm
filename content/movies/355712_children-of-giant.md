Based on the controversial Edna Ferber novel of the same name, the film, Giant did not shy from strong social-issue themes experienced throughout post-WWII America. George Stevens, its producer and director, purposely gravitated to the drought-ridden community of Marfa for most all of the exterior scenes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2pz4mFs8FBJJJeAqlYNxHTq8Ubl.jpg", "actors": ["Earl Holliman (Himself - Interviewed)", "Elsa C\u00e1rdenas (Herself)", "George Stevens Jr. (Himself)", "Robert Hinkle (Himself - Interviewed)", "James R.
