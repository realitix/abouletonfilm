The witches are female and from the lower classes, the persecutors are wealthy white Christians. The story revolves around Garazi (Silvia Munt) whose grandmother is burned at the stake when convicted by the Spanish inquisitor of being a witch, something that brings Garazi under suspicion and eventually into prison. She is tortured in prison and raped by her rejected suitor, the vicious son of a local landlord. While Garazi is suffering her own pain, a struggle on a much broader scale is in the offing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5x9erwDGDyflI3zQM6GrKU4ByX.jpg", "actors": ["S\u00edlvia Munt (Garazi)", "Jos\u00e9 Luis L\u00f3pez V\u00e1zquez (Inquisidor)", "Mary Carrillo (Amunia)", "Walter Vidarte (Don Ferm\u00edn de Andueza)", "Patxi Bisquert (Unai)", "I\u00f1aki Miram\u00f3n (\u00cd\u00f1igo)", "Mariv\u00ed Bilbao ()", "Mikel Garmendia ()", "Javier Loyola (Prior)", "Sergio Mendiz\u00e1bal (Antx\u00f3n)", "F\u00e9lix Rotaeta (J. de Areso)", "Elsa Zabala ()", "Antonio Orengo ()", "Lola Lemos ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
