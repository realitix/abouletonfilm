It features interviews with some of the genre's biggest stars, like Fred Williamson, Pam Grier, and Richard Roundtree. Director Melvin Van Peebles discusses the historical importance of his landmark film Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song. For a contemporary perspective, the excitable Quentin Tarantino offers his spirited commentary and author/critic bell hooks provides some scholarly social analysis.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/25Ob4PFvrdhlpMuN1QXOtWR6LKG.jpg", "actors": ["Larry Cohen (Himself)", "Tamara Dobson (Herself)", "Ron Finley (Himself)", "Pam Grier (Herself)", "Ed Guerrero (Himself)", "Isaac Hayes (Himself)", "Gloria Hendry (Herself)", "Bell Hooks (Herself)", "Roy Innis (Himself)", "Jesse Jackson (Himself)", "Samuel L.
