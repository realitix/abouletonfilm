One hopes to find gravitational waves, the other - axions, the third is looking for magnetic monopoles. Each of these waves and particles is predicted by theorists, but whether it exists in nature in reality, no one knows for sure.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
