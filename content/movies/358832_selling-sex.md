Dispelling the myth that all sex workers are victims, Megan calls sex work her calling and shows how stigma, double standards and marginalization harm all women. Featuring interviews with fellow escorts, a client and researchers, the film follows Megan as she prepares to give a speech on the value of sex work to an audience of missionaries, anti-trafficking activists and law enforcement personnel. Smart, funny, and articulate, she demonstrates her bravery and conviction from beginning to end.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
