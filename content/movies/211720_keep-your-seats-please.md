Help seems to be at hand when George is left a fortune by his old auntie, but unfortunately his inheritance is hidden inside a chair which has already been auctioned off! Can George and his chums track down his rightful due before his grasping solicitor (Alastair Sim, in an early film appearance) snatches the lot? It's hard to say, but he still finds time to perform both the title song and the classic 'When I'm Cleaning Windows'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wcKUVv1rd9NvgQX5HgzLUP1aHtE.jpg", "actors": ["George Formby (George Withers)", "Florence Desmond (Florrie)", "Alastair Sim (A.
