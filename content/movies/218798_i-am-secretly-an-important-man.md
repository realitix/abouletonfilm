Bernstein (aka Jesse Bernstein), one of Seattle's most celebrated and troubled voices. His angry, surprisingly fresh, lyrical writings are about sensitive souls, drifters and drug addicts, people alienated by a society that refuses to understand them. Bernstein was an integral part of the legendary Seattle rock scene of the late 80's and early 90s, and in 1991 was dubbed the 'Godfather of Grunge.'", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uBHs6IPFlsuwlD9m4F2fpGYfErF.jpg", "actors": ["Steven \"Jesse\" Bernstein (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
