The prestigious LMP1 class dominated the headlines with a stunning battle between polesitters Toyota and perennial favourites Porsche.  However, for the 250,000 trackside fans the real entertainment was going on down the field in the GTE Pro race.  In an incredible three-way, race-long struggle Aston Martin, Ford and Chevrolet ended up being separated by just seconds after a full 24 hours of tough but fair competition.  As ever with Le Mans, the biggest enemy wasn\u2019t the opposing drivers but simply attrition as the highly tuned cars operated at the sharp edge continuously for a full day and night.  With cameras all around the course, and right in the pit lanes the official review will show you the most exciting action from the track and all the drama when crews had to rush to fix damage.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
