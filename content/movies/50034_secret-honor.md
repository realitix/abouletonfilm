His monologue explores his personal life and describes his upbringing and his mother. A tape recorder, a gun and whiskey are his only companions during his entire monologue, which is tinged with the vitriol and paranoia that puzzled the public during his presidency.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hYiadiL0xgIqpPgKj02NkYsb988.jpg", "actors": ["Philip Baker Hall (Richard Nixon)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [185181, 46504, 83346, 53028], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
