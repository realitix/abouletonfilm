In this production, the bible skeptic Brett Palmer, tackles the topic of the days of Genesis in much more detail than was given in his original What Genesis Got Wrong series, to finally lay to rest the question of whether or not the days of Genesis were likely conceived of by the original author of the text to be periods of a literal 24 hours each.  When Moses, under the inspiration of God, compiled the account of creation in Genesis 1, he used the Hebrew word 'yom' for 'day'.  He combined y\u00f4m with numbers (first day, second day, third day, etc.) and with the words 'evening and morning', and the first time he employed it he carefully defined the meaning of yom (used in this way) as being one night/day cycle (Genesis 1:5).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fPhNrjk7x2AAyF0Lr1xXl9gVdmG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
