These two elements are interposed in editing so as to suggest the seasonal changes of tree-leaf (from greens to golds, reds and browns) and the sky (from varieties of warm-to-cold blues).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jM1tcITKBgk95djMy5dBHfwpqOF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [255530, 235877, 131193, 111152], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
