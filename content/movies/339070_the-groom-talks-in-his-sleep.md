'Virtually plotless, and feeling more like comic sketches than fully developed stories,' writes Arthur Nolletti, Jr, 'these light comedies, or farces, take a wholly trivial matter (often a socially embarrassing situation) and use it as a springboard for a succession of gags.' Much of the films' distinction comes from the wit of Gosho's direction, the imaginative use of the new sound technology and the charm of the acting, particularly of the heroines (Kinuyo Tanaka in Bride; Hiroko Kawasaki in Groom). Yet in both films, Gosho finds room for some shrewd observation of character and environment, subtly exploring the values and assumptions of the suburban petit bourgeoisie.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/94lnB9GKrlyQfep2P51EKGOdDmQ.jpg", "actors": ["Hiroko Kawasaki (Bride)", "Kazuo Hasegawa (Yasuo the Bridegroom)", "Tokuji Kobayashi (Bridegroom's friend)", "Setsuko Shinobu (His wife)", "Ry\u00f4tar\u00f4 Mizushima (Bride's father)", "Eiko Takamatsu (Bridegroom's mother)", "Tatsuo Sait\u00f4 (Researcher)", "Tomio Aoki (Boy at liquor shop)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
