I\u2019ve also attempted bring the prequels in alignment with the original trilogy by cutting anything that broke continuity. I really want viewers to be able to watch Episodes 1-6, in order, without having key moments in the later films spoiled. Anakin no longer is C3PO\u2019s creator. In fact, C3PO and R2D2 are no longer major (minor?) characters in the PT. They are now just like any other droid. They do have minor dialog here or there, but they are never referenced by name nor are their roles significant.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/laUj4K79lO14uaIAfnvkg6yQPz9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
