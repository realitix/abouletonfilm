Not even Reagan\u2019s appointed mouthpiece, notorious press secretary Larry Speakes, had much to say about the crisis beyond derisive laughter.  Using never-before-heard audio tapes from three separate press conferences, in 1982, 1983, and 1984, When AIDS Was Funny illustrates how the reporter Lester Kinsolving, a conservative (and not at all gay-friendly) fixture in the White House press corps, was consistently scoffed at when he posed urgent questions about the AIDS epidemic. With snickering, homophobic jokes and a disturbing air of uninterest, Speakes dismisses Kinsolving\u2019s concerns about the escalating problem.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h4ZCrwbUlbnR3452foi6GEigi67.jpg", "actors": ["Larry Speakes ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
