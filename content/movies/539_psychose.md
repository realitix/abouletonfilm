Son travail ne la passionne plus, son amant ne peut l'\u00e9pouser car il doit verser une \u00e9norme pension alimentaire le laissant sans le sou... Mais un beau jour, son patron lui demande de d\u00e9poser 40 000 dollars \u00e0 la banque. La tentation est trop grande, et Marion s'enfuit avec l'argent. Tr\u00e8s vite la panique commence \u00e0 se faire sentir. Partag\u00e9e entre l'angoisse de se faire prendre et l'excitation de mener une nouvelle vie, Marion roule vers une destination qu'elle n'atteindra jamais. La pluie est battante, la jeune femme s'arr\u00eate pr\u00e8s d'un motel, tenu par un sympathique g\u00e9rant nomm\u00e9 Norman Bates, mais qui doit supporter le caract\u00e8re possessif de sa m\u00e8re.

Haven't you?\u201d\r\n\r\nA Phoenix secretary, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), embezzles $40,000 and rashly flees town, ending up at a remote motel in Fairvale, California, where she encounters the eccentric Mama\u2019s boy Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Mixed into this web is a private investigator (Martin Balsam), Marion\u2019s sister (Vera Miles) and Marion\u2019s secret beau (John Gavin).\r\n\r\nDirected by Alfred Hitchcock based on Robert Bloch\u2019s book, \u201cPsycho\u201d made a huge impact when it was released in 1960. It contains a plot development that was groundbreaking at the time shared by England\u2019s \u201cCity of the Dead\u201d (aka \u201cHorror Hotel\u201d), which went into production six weeks earlier than \u201cPsycho\u201d and was released in the UK at the same time, but not in America until 2 years later. While they\u2019re both good, \u201cPsycho\u201d is way superior. It was followed by three sequels (1983, 1986 and 1990), the last being a semi-prequel, all starring Anthony Perkins as Norman with Vera Miles returning for the first one.\r\n\r\nOne thing I don\u2019t like is that it was shot in B&W. Check out the sequels and the 1998 remake to observe the same settings in living color.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 49 minutes and was shot primarily at the backlot of Universal Studios, Universal City, California, with other parts in Los Angeles & Gorman, California, and Phoenix, Arizona. \r\n\r\nGRADE: A"}], "recommandations_id": [426, 567, 571, 213], "youtube_key": "tRFnwT6tnbU"}
