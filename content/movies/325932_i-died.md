It's a very raw view into what drives these friends, and why someone might have committed murder. This ultra-low budget film is shot completely in real time and with a single camera move. There is a bit of strong language, adult situations, and very mild violence.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
