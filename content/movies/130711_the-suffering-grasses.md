Against the backdrop of the Arab Spring and the complicated politics of the region, this film explores the Syrian conflict through the humanity of the civilians who have been killed, abused, and displaced. In all such conflicts, it is civilians, women and children, families and whole communities, who suffer at the leisure of those in power. When elephants go to war, it is the grass that suffers", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dVxETHco1BD7lhaGM7dGKFKaSy5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "p9CdBjg2OIk"}
