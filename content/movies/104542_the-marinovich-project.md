Trained by his father, Marv, a former pro football player and a strength and conditioning guru, the young Marinovich was meticulously engineered and nurtured into a star quarterback. When it came to performance, Marv expected perfection and Todd delivered. He was dubbed \"Robo QB,\" and his performance initially lived up to the name as he set passing records in high school, vied for the Heisman while at USC and ultimately was selected in the first round of the 1991 NFL draft by his hometown Los Angeles Raiders. But two years later, he was out of the NFL, a full-blown drug addict in search of a life beyond football. \"The Marinovich Project\" tells the unvarnished story of Todd's unique ascent to stardom, the dark descent that followed and the complicated father-son bond throughout, ultimately answering the question \"What went wrong with Todd Marinovich?\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3G3RbFS8xwEY6f5S95cDS63TgoN.jpg", "actors": ["Marcus Allen (himself)", "Stan Brock (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
