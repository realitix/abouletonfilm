He created the first banking computer in the world, was perhaps one of the first computer nerds ever and pursued an unprecedented career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the \"mighty\" MIT in Cambridge, where he invented the first virtual persona, ELIZA/DOCTOR, a program that engaged humans in conversation with a computer.  Later, Weizenbaum was branded as a heretic when he began to criticize his colleagues in public. After retiring as a full professor at MIT, he left the United States and is now living in Berlin-Mitte again. Joseph Weizenbaum eventually became a \"preacher\", strictly demanding responsibility of each individual scientist, condemning war and arguing that mankind have become insane.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rwCDX2Yu9BxhLS0U3OvWr889Ce3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
