After an opening dance, a quartet of beer-drinkers gargles the Volga Boatman song, then another group hauling on a rope sings it (we finally see that the other end of the rope is anchored by a very small dog). A trench-coated bomber sneaks into the palace, where we see Rice-Puddin', the mad monk, cheating at a jigsaw puzzle. He spies the activity in the gypsy camp and orders a henchman to fetch the gypsy girl. The villagers revolt as a result, sending The Mad Monk scrambling on his horse; they stuff a bomb into his pants just as he turns his horse into a helicopter, and it explodes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2sO3OrpGkQND2NpZMzIEfaAwd8P.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
