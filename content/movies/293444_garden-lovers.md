The film with comic undertones looks at their stories behind the hedges.  The garden provides a framework for tales of relationship conflicts and joys; it depicts the many ways in which life can flourish; it gives strength and unites, but it also becomes a meeting place for farewells. There is an invisible bond that grows between the couples in the film; they comment and comfort each other with their own stories.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6pKNGM01lV350PNy382ThRG8813.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "V_nJ6OTAeRg"}
