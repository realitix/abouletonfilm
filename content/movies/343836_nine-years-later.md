By turns gruesome and ironic, these three home-made 'music videos', including Panic, Big Mouth Strikes Again and Girlfriend In A Coma, are brought to their ultimate and canny conclusion only with Beck's long delayed return to them. Revisiting his highly self-conscious and idiosyncratic performances Beck betrays the apparent ease and economy of the original clips by deftly editing them against the awkwardness and obsessiveness of their numerous out-takes. Wittingly, with intertitles and voice-over, Beck calibrates his performances retrospectively with the video technology that recorded them, and inadvertently traverses a decade of video history...from the mainstream-media inspired work of the 1980s to the more reflexive performance-based practices of the 1990s.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1egrCEPvSdUvG9zdjiA4MBb0Lxx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
