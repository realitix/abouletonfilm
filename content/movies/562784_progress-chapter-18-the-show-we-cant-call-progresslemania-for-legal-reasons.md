The downside is that this adds many minutes to the show, but it also helps keep the live event feel on tape.  We get our first taste of a Jim Smallman pre-show spiel \u2013 and to show his feelings (at the time), he\u2019s bedecked in a Die Havoc Die t-shirt. Jim leads a \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d chant for the company, which gives way to \u201cwe want cake\u201d chants, before the crowd show their respects for the (then) recently-passed Perro Aguayo Jr., Cincinnati Red and Drew McDonald.  Jim then teases the crowd with \u201csomething after the interval\u201d \u2013 but chants of a raffle are quickly shot down. Those never go well in PROGRESS\u2026 nor do falafel raffles, but they do make for an exceedingly good chant.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
