Set within an isolated desert landscape contrasted with recognizable scenes of the intensity of family life, this vanguard work demonstrates the richness and variety of the black experience; it is a poetic and hard-hitting commentary on the complexities of race, gender and sexuality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zdunAxyitFv2pwjtivThUfs0E9H.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
