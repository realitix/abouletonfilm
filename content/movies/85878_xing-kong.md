May is worried about her mother and father, whose marriage is on the rocks, and she yearns to return to the woods where her grandfather lives. One day, May befriends a boy as lonely as she is. When reality catches up, they run away to a beautiful world that belongs only to them. Both imaginatively escapist and heartbreakingly realistic, their journey speaks to kids and adults alike with the pain of solitude, the sorrow of loss, and the warmth of hope.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kvb7pw6JLNiEGZyewLxdaDKaJRV.jpg", "actors": ["Xu Jiao (Hsieh Hsin-Mei / May)", "Eric Lin Hui-Ming (Chou Yu-Chieh / Jay)", "Ren\u00e9 Liu (Xiao Mei's mother)", "Harlem Yu (Xiao Mei's father)", "Kenneth Tsang (Xiao Mei's grandfather)", "Janel Tsai (Jay's mother)", "Kwai Lun-Mei (Xiao Mei (adult))", "Shih Chin-Hang (Teacher)", "Lee Lieh (Puzzle shop boss)", "Chen Yu-Hsun (Driver)", "Huang Shih-Han (Wendy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [44740, 143315, 18486, 93898], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
