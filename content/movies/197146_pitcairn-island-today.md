The island is self-sufficient and has few visitors. Among the islanders we see at work is Fletcher Christian's great-grandson.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/deQhvDJvIEQHcqM903XDamJs0Vr.jpg", "actors": ["Carey Wilson (Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
