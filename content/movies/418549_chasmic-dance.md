Alluding to the cosmic dance of Shiva, the film is an expression of primal rhythmic energy, moving dialectically but without sublimation. Regeneration ignites destruction, and transformation invites mutation, through clashes of opposing modes such as video/film, surface/depth, and light/darkness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bcL4xQ9v43mOTXb2eVf6Ib91hfb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
