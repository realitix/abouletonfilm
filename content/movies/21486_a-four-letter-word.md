Zeke and Luke work in a sex shop: Zeke takes gay liberation seriously, Luke likes to sparkle and takes nothing seriously. He's offended when Stephen calls him a gay clich\u00e9, then, surprisingly, they find each other attractive and interesting. Stephen, it turns out, has a great apartment, trust fund, and artwork he's painted on his walls. Meanwhile, Peter, a neat-freak, and Derek, nice to everyone, move in together. Peter's compulsiveness threatens the relationship. Last, newly-engaged Marilyn, a recovering alcoholic stuck at step 2, can't stop obsessing about wedding details. Can these folks sort out civilization and its discontents?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ahSDLe1dOo0PJov0zfGqMomHnXp.jpg", "actors": ["Jesse Archer (Luke)", "Charlie David (Stephen)", "Jeremy Gender (Mace)", "Cory W.
