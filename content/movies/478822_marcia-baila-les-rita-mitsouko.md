It was the third single from their first album, \"Rita Mitsouko\", and was released in April of that year. Produced by Conny Plank. Dedicated to a dancer with the band who died in 1981, this song was a big hit both in France and abroad and can be considered as being one of the band's signature songs. The song was composed by both members of the group, Catherine Ringer and Fred Chichin.
