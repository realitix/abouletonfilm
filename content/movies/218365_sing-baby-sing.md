Adolphe Menjou plays the Barrymore counterpart, a loose-living movie star with a penchant for wine, women, and more wine. Alice Faye plays a nightclub singer hungry for publicity. Her agent (Gregory Ratoff) arranges a \"romance\" between Faye and Menjou. Eventually Faye winds up with Michael Whalen, allowing Menjou to continue his blissful, bibulous bachelorhood. Sing, Baby, Sing represented the feature-film debut of the Ritz Brothers, who are in top form in their specialty numbers--and who are awarded a final curtain call after the \"The End\" title, just so the audience won't forget them (The same device was used to introduce British actor George Sanders in Fox's Lancer Spy [37]).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aiRqXnO4hxwSNE2w3Bsa0uOjwtb.jpg", "actors": ["Alice Faye (Joan Warren)", "Adolphe Menjou (Bruce Farraday)", "Gregory Ratoff (Nicholas K.
