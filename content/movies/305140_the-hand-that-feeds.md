Mild-mannered sandwich maker Mahoma L\u00f3pez has never been interested in politics, but in Jan. 2012, he convinces a small group of his co-workers to fight back. Risking deportation and the loss of livelihood, the workers team up with a diverse crew of innovative young organizers and take the unusual step of forming an independent union, launching themselves on a journey that will test the limits of their resolve. In one rollercoaster year, they must overcome a shocking betrayal and a two month lockout. Lawyers will battle in backroom negotiations, Occupy Wall Street protesters will take over the restaurant, and a picket line will divide the neighborhood. If they can win a contract, it will set a historic precedent for low-wage workers across the country. But whatever happens, Mahoma and his compa\u00f1eros won't be exploited again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p7Pa2wDpDcrdCjKXkvfrgK1NkH5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
