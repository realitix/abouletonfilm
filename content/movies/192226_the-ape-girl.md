She also resembles a monkey for most of the film (not really explained why). She grows up and falls for a prince who is really an evil kung fu master, who exploits her abilities for his own gain. Now here's why the film works; Kam Fung does an excellent job as the Ape Girl, being very eccentric at times with the actions of a monkey. Also, we see early performances by Lo Lieh as an assassin, and Chen Sing as the prince.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7jtN4wocpFDfl1YDb699uPwPJck.jpg", "actors": ["Chan Sing (4th Prince)", "Lo Lieh (Assassin)", "Miao Tian (Monkey girl's old master)", "Gam Fung-Ling (Monkey girl)", "Lee Man-Tai (Beggar)", "Shao Lo-Hui ()", "Ngai Chi-Wong ()", "Chan Sam-Lam ()", "Wong Cheong-Chi (Prince's advisor)", "Gam Ban ()", "Liu Shan ()", "Yuen Si-Wo ()", "Au Lap-Bo (Servant of bridegroom)", "Ho Kang ()", "Danny Chow ()", "Yu Bong ()", "Gam Boh ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
