To what lengths would any of us go to stave off the inexorable rite of aging, sickness, and finally\u2026 death.  The film reveals a noblewoman and her devotees perpetuating their power by preying upon her subjects. For each young victim, the rite of adolescence becomes a rite of death. And for the noblewoman \u2013 the COUNTESS BATHORY \u2013 the rite of death becomes a rite of adolescence. Roles reversed, through blood sacrifice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bIttNtYZmOORkXbkQOnDmefq5vO.jpg", "actors": ["Carolyn Weltman ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
