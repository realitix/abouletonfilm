There's a trip to the barber, icecream for the kids, the weekly football match and a beer at the pub. Come nightfall, it's either a movie or the local dance. This beautifully shot film by Academy Award winner Dean Semler captures all the atmosphere of a weekly ritual repeated in country towns right across Australia.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6yQ5MVpVUyJL5N8D457lPrOsLNQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
