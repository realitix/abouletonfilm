Although Plato\u2019s account of Atlantian masonry, consisting of red, white and black stones, was a visually perfect match for the modern walls of the Minoan excavation site favored by the film, and his account of a sea made impassable by small islands of mud could, in fact, be a description of the rafts of pumice left by the catastrophic eruption of an ancient volcano there, little mention is made of Plato's specific account of where Atlantis was or the common root that links Atlantis to the Atlantic ocean. Also omitted is Plato's chronology placing the sinking of Atlantis in the same time frame as the end of the last ice age which caused the inundation of huge expanses of once fertile lands. Is \"Atlantis: The Evidence\" a thinly disguised example of Eurocentrism in the media? Watch Discovery: Atlantis for a more comprehensive view on an age-old debate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1M2w2ZuZGPKH3JwK1y8zojfFLin.jpg", "actors": ["Piers Gibbon (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
