All the band's signature punk anthems (including \"Suburban Rebels,\" \"Smash the Discos\" and \"Drinking and Driving\") are featured. Genre devotees will recall that the Business was at the forefront of the Oi (aka street punk) movement that became an offshoot of traditional punk music.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
