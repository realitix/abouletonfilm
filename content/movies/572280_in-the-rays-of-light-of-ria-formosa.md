The work is a spiritual portrait of a place and time. It is, as is Cabanas, willfully slow, meditative, passive. It has no evident narrative, though I hope I was able in my editing and other choices to impart a kind of slowly developing momentum which functions vaguely like a narrative, or like the melodic line in a piece of music. Finally LUZ is about light, and philosophically about life, and our place on this planet, and its place in the universe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pRol2E4zFcaQ673VM1LxfFXhv7T.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
