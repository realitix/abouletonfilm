What might sound like a distracting stunt is in fact the film\u2019s distinctive strength. Relying on subtleties of acting rather than heavy makeup, with seamless digital compositing in multi-character scenes, Wiley\u2019s tour de force defamiliarizes the material with startling effectiveness and compels us to get under the skins of all the major players in the tragic events.
