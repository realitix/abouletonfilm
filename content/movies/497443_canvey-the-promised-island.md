This film follows the reactions of the island\u2019s Anglican and agnostic residents as they get to grips with their new neighbours. It has the potential to be a culture clash, but leaders on both sides of the sea wall are determined that good neighbourly relations will prevail. The film follows Chris Fenwick, island native and manager of rock band Dr Feelgood, as he organises a party for both communities with social integration at the top of the menu. With Anglican priest David Tudor and key Hasidic elders on side, can Chris join the new Canvey Island community together in peace and integration?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ftxHL99sATbDSN5HjFpjNDFA2r2.jpg", "actors": ["Chris Fenwick (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
