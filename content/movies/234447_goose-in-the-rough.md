All the birds are nesting- that is, all but Goose Beary. She just sits, gazing longingly out the window at happy birds. A car horn and loud voice brings Charlie Beary to the window. It seems that Charlie and his friend Pete have a golf date. Charlie leaves his hatful of golf balls on a chair as he gets his clubs. Goose finds them and happily sits on them, mistaking them for goose eggs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y1AJw0fmRaIt5RR8JlUqiAHmJFN.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Frees (Charlie Beary (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "9XV6JeKHs8c"}
