With their graduation getting closer and closer, most of them pray for decent grades, but one of them, a skeptical girl called Moss, makes a mocking pledge that she will do anything in return for the satisfaction of her friend's desires. while their friends are careful to make sure they provide the promised offerings as their wishes are fulfilled, Muay, Pin, and Moss are not so diligent.
