When this happens though, she blacks out. Even in her day-to-day life, she can hear people's evil intentions and true colors and senses their lies and deception. That is why she always wears headphones in order to shut out people's emotions. She works well with her colleagues at the \"Red Spider Lily\" (Higanbana) unit, who are all brutally honest acid-tongued women with no qualms about speaking their minds. \"Red Spider Lily\" is an eclectic unit that includes a science geek, a single mom, and a woman who grew up abroad.
