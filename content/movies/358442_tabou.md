A legacy of a history that is too heavy to bear, premeditated film, manipulation, and guilt. It's flashback, a crossroads of life and death, love and indifference, youth who feels lost, or one who believes he is found. It's a true story, a fragment of two lives that intersect at the threshold of adult life.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
