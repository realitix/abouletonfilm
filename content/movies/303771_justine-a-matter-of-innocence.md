She is charming and sweet, but her uncle is scandalous and wanton. Justine happens one day to enter her uncle's bathroom and discovers him with his mistress. This utterly shocks the innocent Justine, and she runs frightened to her bedroom. The image of the sexual encounter burns in her mind, however, and she begins to have lusty sex-filled dreams of her own. For the bulk of the film Justine is a virgin with explicit fantasies. In the end, however, she strategically moves from fantasy to reality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y0PlnqhBBp7qYFTfH3nz2VRcLVW.jpg", "actors": ["Hillary Summers (Justine Cates)", "Ashley Moore (Steven Cates)", "Vanessa del Rio (Claudia Kendall)", "Merle Michaels (Lynn - Black Lingerie)", "Christie Ford (Laurie - Red Lingerie)", "Christine DeShaffer (Michelle the Maid)", "Andy Hayes (Greg Cates)", "Linda Vale (Margaret)", "Robin Sane (Elaine)", "Bethanna (Sex Performer - Long Hair)", "Rick Iverson (Don)", "Dave Ruby (Santo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
