A superb mimic, he takes us to an electrical store on a Saturday morning, where all the shops assistants are toddlers. We're then transported to London Zoo where the tigers are winding up the lions. Phill is also terrified of spiders. Join him in his fearful tales of trying to catch his eight-legged enemies, whilst trying to save face with his father-in-law.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eCe2kpqFg46fjFypmMYfesscNj2.jpg", "actors": ["Phill Jupitus (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
