{"tmdb_id": 186569, "title": "Bad Weather", "original_title": "Bad Weather", "slug_title": "bad-weather", "date": "2011-11-23", "genre": ["Documentaire"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "Off the coast of Bangladesh in the Bay of Bengal is a tiny 'brothel island' populated by women forced to sell their bodies to men who arrive by the boatload.  Each of the women came to inhabit the 100m long and 10m wide piece of land for different reasons, whether through a sister, the need for money, or in search of love and affection, but for all of them it is a life tougher than they could have imagined.  Deepening their troubles is the island's existence at the frontline of climate change, and with the increase of cyclones, floods and soil erosion the prospect of losing their homes, and the island itself, is closer than ever.  Beautifully shot and subverting expectation, Bad Weather is a documentary that carves out a message of hope in extreme adversity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/edHAK3T9feQIMYsekipSuIkNZi7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
