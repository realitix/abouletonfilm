As this engaging story opens, a retired schoolteacher and his wife are at home with their four grown sons and one daughter. The oldest son is a teacher whose wife is expecting a baby. The youngest son is a student in New Delhi and, defying custom, his young wife opts to go live with her own family while her husband is at school instead of remaining with her in-laws. Will her behavior and that of the younger generation undermine the tradition that holds the society and family together? After the youngest son graduates and gets a job, he and his wife move across the country to New Delhi. As the siblings continue to grow and develop their own lives and families, the mother and father face a gradual and inevitable adjustment to living without them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r8bHK6r5GyGVyt1Rn8kuj6gIXki.jpg", "actors": ["Kishori Devi ()", "Sampad Mahapatra ()", "Manaswini Mangaraj ()", "Manimala ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
