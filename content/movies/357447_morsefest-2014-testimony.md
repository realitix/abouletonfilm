This is the second major live release of the album, the first being done in 2004.  So 10 years later we have much of the same player plus new band members of the Neal Morse Band, Bill Hubauer and Eric Gillete.  Together with Mike Portnoy and Randy George and a very large supporting case, you get 2 and half hours of live progressive rock.  Testimony is a story of how Neal Morse came to follow Jesus.  \r\n\r\nFans of symphonic progressive music will love this live performance."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "621UCkSh5UY"}
