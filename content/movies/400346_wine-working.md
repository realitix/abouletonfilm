The so far peacefully farming Unified farmers' cooperative starts splitting. Some of the farmers have found the cooperative called Vidrupa and want to deal with wine in private trade. Michal Jan\u00e1k, chairman of the farmers' cooperative is a deliberate man and refuses the latent return to the capitalism. As an excellent farmer he continues preparing planting out new vineyards. His adversaries do not agree - the returns will come many years later. Jozka Hrdlicka, an \u00e9migr\u00e9, notices on the Austrian TV the interview with the representatives of Vidrupa and decides to visit his native village. The new suit and the hired car transform the bankrupt and criminal to the successful businessman with wine.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vm3K7lRDLsCUnxNAEPxTPJykHgg.jpg", "actors": ["Vladim\u00edr Men\u0161\u00edk (Michal Jan\u00e1k)", "Bo\u017eidara Turzonovov\u00e1 (Katerina Mlcochov\u00e1)", "Ji\u0159\u00ed Vala (Josef Hrdli\u010dka)", "\u010cestm\u00edr \u0158anda st.
