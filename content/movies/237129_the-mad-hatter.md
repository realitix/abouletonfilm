His sole hat is eaten by moths so he goes to Wally Walrus' hat store to purchase a new one (and, for once, does not give Wally a hard time). After a few attempts to get the hat to fit Woody's head, he buys the hat but it blows away landing on a goose in a meadow. After tussling with the goose, he gets his head back but loses his job at the studio anyway.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bol5ItrJfpcq61ANpYsop4qQSSn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
