He wears glasses. He's lonely. He's a mediocre computer programmer that lives in Tel Aviv and spends most of his energy searching online for a girlfriend. His only friend is Audrey, his beloved female dog. Eisenberg is a thug. Tall, fat, approaching middle age and not completely sane. He spends his days slouching around Meir Park, harassing innocent bystanders and doing business with petty thieves and small-time criminals. Unfortunately the two cross paths, and Eisenberg decides that they should start hanging out. But something in his demeanor says that he wants to be much more than just friends...This is a story about random meetings with strangers that lead to anxiety and paranoia. About lonely people in the big city. About losing control.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8O9SVZCwacFuqew5dTakpqA4X1R.jpg", "actors": ["Yitzhak Laor (Goldberg)", "Yahav Gal (Eisenberg)", "Ronny Dotan (Noa)", "Ori Halevy (Absalom)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
