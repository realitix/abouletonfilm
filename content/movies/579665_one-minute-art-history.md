Throughout the film, the central character goes through the small motions of everyday movements like checking the time and having a drink, with each frame rendered in a different art historical style. The film starts in ancient Egypt and progresses through Chinese ink paintings and Japanese block prints to Modigliani and Basquiat-style portraits. Cao renders a vast array of art styles in a manner that is evocative without being overworked.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tPyiVlCKSjjXuLfGoQLo2BAiRk1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
