In Kansas City, pop culture is something to be twisted and reshaped, relationships are either nonexistent or refabricated, and time is unstructured and teasing. At the heart of these girls' lives\u2014and this innovative work of cinema\u2014is a quest for understanding and a sense of place. The risks run and solutions posed engender both laughs and tears. The film's amateur actors and nonlinear narrative bring an unnerving, utterly human face to the challenges of young womanhood in a world that would prefer that girls watch the Disney Channel.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rbgdf2RfCk3W7ZC6XaDOnQqVent.jpg", "actors": ["Abby Bavley (Abby)", "Emily Boullear (Emily)", "Tate Buck (Tate)", "Cyan Meeks (Cyan)", "Annie Montgomery (Annie)", "Mary Nichols (Mary)", "Julie Potratz (Julie)", "Paige Sanders (Paige)", "Marcia Trayford (Marcia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
