On the one-year anniversary of his mother's death, Tokyo art and fashion photographer Takeru (Joe Odagiri) returns to his small hometown in order to pay his respects. But all is not well back home, and when Takeru's authoritative father questions his sincerity, the frustrated son strikes back with accusations of violent conduct. Though the situation is initially diffused by Takeru's older brother Moniru (Teruyuki Kagawa), who stayed behind to run the family business, tensions once again start to run high when Tekeru, Moniru, and pretty childhood friend Cheiko (Yoko Maki) decide to celebrate their reunion by taking a hike in the wilderness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g98xhef5v538WA4RMFnp5lguwS4.jpg", "actors": ["Joe Odagiri (Takeru Hayakawa)", "Teruyuki Kagawa (Minoru Hayakawa)", "Yoko Maki (Chieko Kawabata)", "Hirofumi Arai (Yohei Okajima)", "Masat\u014d Ibu (Isamu Hayakawa)", "Keizo Kanie (Osamu Hayakawa)", "Yuichi Kimura (Akihito Maruo)", "Tomoro Taguchi (Judge)", "Pierre Taki (Funaki)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [38013, 63101, 70846], "youtube_key": "CZXzgt6NkhE"}
