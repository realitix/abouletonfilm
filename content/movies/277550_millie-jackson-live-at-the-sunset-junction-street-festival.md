Known as someone not afraid to speak her mind, Jackson puts on a characteristically raw show full of rocking music and four-letter words. The provocative and uninhibited songstress found later success as host of her own Dallas-based radio program.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
