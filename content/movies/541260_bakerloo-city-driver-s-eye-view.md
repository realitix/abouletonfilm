The southern terminus at Elephant and Castle consists of just two platforms, requiring fast turnarounds to provide the 3 minute service interval. Just under half the 14\u00bd mile line is in tube tunnel, The 1972 stock trains (amongst the oldest running on the network) surface at Queen's Park. Roughly one in three continues to Harrow and Wealdstone alongside the West Coast Main Line. As well as seeing the entire route in real time from the driver's cab, we also peek inside the Bakerloo Line's signalling and control centre at Baker Street.  The Waterloo and City line is LUL's smallest self-contained operation, running for just over 1\u00bd miles between Waterloo and Bank.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oKKj4MrrN7p6xTwRl4vOEKi3ZNt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
