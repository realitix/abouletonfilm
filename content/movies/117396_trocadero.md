Hanging out in Hollywood's famed Trocadero restaurant and night-spot, he gets his story when \"Troc\" owner and band-leader Eddie LeBaron, relates to him the sage of the famed screenland nitery. And hears plenty of music furnished by four of the top name-bands in the land, including that of Bob Chester, who formed his own swing band in 1935 after being top saxophonist with the bands of Ben Pollack and Ben Bernie. Singer Ida James and the Chester band led off with \"Shoo Shoo Baby\" in their screen debut.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cyFiPibzaFnBn5F4Xladbxkvuw6.jpg", "actors": ["Rosemary Lane (Judy Edwards)", "Johnny Downs (Johnny Edwards)", "Ralph Morgan (Sam Wallace)", "Dick Purcell (Spike Nelson)", "Sheldon Leonard (Mickey Jones)", "Dewey Robinson (Bullfrog)", "Marjorie Manners (Marge Carson)", "Emmett Vogan (Mr. Carson)", "Cliff Nazarro (Himself)", "Charles Calvert (Tony Rocadero)", "Ida James (Singer)", "Bess Flowers (Nightclub Patron)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
