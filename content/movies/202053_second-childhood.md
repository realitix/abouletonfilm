A toy airplane comes flying through an open window and breaks a vase, and when its owner, Spanky, comes in search of it he is informed he will have to pay seventy-five cents for the broken vase. Spanly has never seen six-bit, much less having it in his pants, so he offers his and his friend's help in cleaning up the yard in exchange. Before the kids are through, they've given the old lady a new outlook on life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xkTT17CJEmSRl5Tc0Oug6lzz44n.jpg", "actors": ["Darla Hood (Darla)", "Eugene 'Porky' Lee (Porky)", "George McFarland (Spanky)", "Carl Switzer (Alfalfa)", "Billie Thomas (Buckwheat)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
