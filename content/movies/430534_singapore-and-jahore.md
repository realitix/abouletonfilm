The camera observes Singapore's traditional neighborhoods, trade, and small craft, which are dominated by people of Chinese ancestry. Then, we drive the modern causeway to Jahor's small capital, Johor Bahru, for a look at imposing buildings and a visit to the grounds of the sultan. The sultan's son invites the crew in, and we meet the sultan, \"H.H.\" himself. The narrator relates the sultan's commitment to commerce, economic well-being, and tolerance, stemming in part from his European education.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Krev3c0JKitIQdQ1zy4dd3RYbI.jpg", "actors": ["James A.
