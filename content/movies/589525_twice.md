Woman and Man begin as friends, become lovers, break up and finally create an authentic, non-monogamous life together. Woman is an American in Paris who loves more than one person at once; at the start of the story, she's honest with her lovers, but hides her polyamory from the outside world until she learns to come out. Man is an English expat who begins as a womanizer, lying to all the ladies in his life until he falls apart, faces his addictions and rebuilds his life around truth. Entirely told in voice-over from inside the two lead characters' minds, the film shows how the love story you tell yourself is the love story you live. While you can always change your life, you can never live the same moment twice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1CikYBCw0t3Uf5LgyoK3eA2TMQA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
