Together and alone, they will travel until the end of the universe.  Each spacecraft carries a golden record album, a massive compilation of images and sounds embodying the best of Planet Earth. According to Carl Sagan, \u201c[t]he spacecraft will be encountered and the record played only if there are advanced space-faring civilizations in interstellar space. But the launching of this bottle into the cosmic ocean says something very hopeful about life on this planet.\u201d  While working on the golden record, Sagan met and fell madly in love with his future wife Annie Druyan. The record became their love letter to humankind and to each other.  In the summer of 2010, I began my own hopeful voyage into the unknown. This film is a love letter to my fellow traveler. - Penny Lane", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4eYau5BcoKylS0LTiPF2hwwkLpY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
