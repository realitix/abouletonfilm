He can clear up the house that his deceased mother turned into a hoarder's paradise. With the professional junk removers he hired and a friend to record every single step on a video camera, Akira seems to have everything taken care of. However, as they go into the house they encountered the expected huge piles of garbage, and something unexpected. It is his elder sister Moe, who's willingly moved to back in the house to carry on the legacy of hoarding. Will he be able to persuade his sister to put an end to their family saga?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7EChDu2JXHDwC7LBfMcjhpsJG1z.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
