One evening, when he returns home from work, he finds a traffic report in the mailbox. But what really gets his attention is the fact that in the photo, in the car, he sees a man sitting next to Ella, his wife. The man puts his hand gently on her neck. Avner cannot see his face. Being the man he is, a man of reason, logic and hard proof, he doesn't talk to her about it, but instead he gets a recorder, and begins to secretly record her telephone conversations, turning into a spy in his own house.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
