The introduction is made through early allegorical forms and figures (triumphal procession, dance of death, Baroque tragedy etc.) The triumphal procession of the giant haystack as a symbol of human vanities becomes a military parade of abrupt, functional and arrogant gestures. The most diverse musical fragments and rhythms intone the montage of details in the staged triumphal procession, juxtaposed with documentary images, including marches, ticker-tape parades and military review.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bJkUuLoxIpUKVrXJfHNkm3Zc4pQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
