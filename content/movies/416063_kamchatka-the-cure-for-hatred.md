Thirteen years later, his life has changed beyond recognition. Living on a remote island in the far east of Russia, far away from Moscow and memories of the violence of war, he is trying to forge a new existence. He films everyday life on the island, with gorgeous shots of spawning salmon and of fishermen going about their work. Sometimes he turns the camera on himself for lengthy shots in which he looks pensively into the lens. But Julia Mironova's camera follows him as well.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
