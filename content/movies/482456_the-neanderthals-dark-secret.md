The bones may help solve the biggest Neanderthal puzzle of all \u2013 why we are here today and Neanderthals are not.  \u2018The Neanderthals\u2019 dark Secret\u2019 revolves around ongoing investigations deep inside the forbidding subterranean cave system called El Sidr\u00f3n. Here, Palaeontologist Antonio Rosas and Archaeologist Marco de la Rasilla are in their 11th year of excavation. Bones from at least 12 people and 400 stone tool fragments have been recovered. We\u2019ll bring these people back from the past. Our haunting, hologram-like Neanderthal characters, will communicate to the scientists of today, as they unlock the secrets of El Sidr\u00f3n. Many mysteries surround the site, foremost, how the bones and tools came to be here in the first place. The remains aren\u2019t weathered nor do they show signs of scavenging from large animals.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
