He's also been called a God, a leader of the new semiotics, and a pioneer of the contemporary art movement. Ryan McGinness: Studio Process, unveils the creative process and highlights Ryan McGinness at work. To witness McGinness at work in his studio is meditative and hypnotic, a complete contrast from the multi-layered work he is well known for. From iconic silkscreen graphics to black light paintings, McGinness creates a hybrid of experiences that move beyond the traditional canvas platform. A modern inventor in many respects, Ryan McGinness uses technology and the traditional method of silk-screening to create meditative experiences that reconstitute the meaning of beauty and timelessness.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
