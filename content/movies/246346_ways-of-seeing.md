Berger's scripts were adapted into a book of the same name. The series and book criticize traditional Western cultural aesthetics by raising questions about hidden ideologies in visual images. The series is partially a response to Kenneth Clark's Civilisation series, which represents a more traditionalist view of the Western artistic and cultural canon.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uI1e23GEdrxdw46CuXdF79asjKH.jpg", "actors": ["John Berger ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
