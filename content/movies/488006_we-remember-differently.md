A white South African middle-class mother and daughter are brought together by the mother's illness. That closeness is more than metaphorical: the daughter must get into the bath to wash her weakened mother. Perhaps prompted by that, the two begin to exhume personal memory - discovering how they recall the past differently and how these nuances of shared experiences shape their perceptions of the present. This contested past is evoked by archival Super-8 footage that is as absorbing as the spinal narrative.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
