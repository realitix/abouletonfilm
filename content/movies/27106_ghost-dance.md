The film focuses on the French philosopher Jacques Derrida, who observes, 'I think cinema, when it's not boring, is the art of letting ghosts come back.' He also says that 'memory is the past that has never had the form of the present.'", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zzfoYWizUR63qiosOD6FdBBxnEd.jpg", "actors": ["Pascale Ogier (Pascale)", "Leonie Mellinger (Marianne)", "Jacques Derrida (Himself)", "Stuart Brisley (Action on Water)", "Robbie Coltrane (George)", "Dominique Pinon (Salesman/Guide)", "Barbara Coles (of Woman)", "Archie Pool (of Myths)", "Ken McMullen (of Man)", "Michael Mellinger (of Marianne's Daydream)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
