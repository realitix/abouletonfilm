She\u2019s just had her first kiss. She believes this is the bittersweet pain of first love. Her first love is her dad\u2019s girlfriend, Inger. At first, Eva cannot tell if it is her envy of her dad\u2019s love or her passion for Inger, but as time passes she finds herself clearly in love. It is an outstanding film that captures delicate, shaky feelings of first love in a cold Norwegian city in winter.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Julia Bache-Wiig (Eva)", "Tom Kristian Berger (Simen)", "H\u00e5kon Ramstad (The Father)", "Maria Ramvi (Nina)", "Kirsti Eline Torhaug (Inger)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
