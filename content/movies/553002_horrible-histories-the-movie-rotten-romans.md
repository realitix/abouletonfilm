He is sent to \"miserable, cold, wet Britain\" where \"the natives are revolting - quite literally\". Things go from bad to worse when Atti is captured by Orla, a feisty teenage Celt desperate to prove herself as a warrior. After narrowly avoiding a very sticky end in a bog, Atti uses his Roman know-how to help Orla save her gran who's been kidnapped by a rival tribe. Meanwhile a furious Nero is determined to crush the rebellion, led by Boudicca, Queen of the Iceni. Atti rejoins his Roman troops and discovers they are preparing for an historic showdown with the Celts at the Battle of Watling Street. Atti's brains could save the day but they could also spell disaster for Orla as the two new friends find themselves lined up on opposite sides of the battlefield.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aq3RDqiMioB6irvGZA8rvkr88zM.jpg", "actors": ["Sebastian Croft (Atti)", "Emilia Jones (Orla)", "Kate Nash (Boudicca)", "Nick Frost (Arghus)", "Craig Roberts (Nero)", "Kim Cattrall (Agrippina)", "Derek Jacobi (Claudius)", "Rupert Graves ()", "Lucy Montgomery ()", "Tony Gardner ()", "Alex MacQueen ()", "Tony Way ()", "Dominique Moore (Traveller)", "Kevin Hudson ()", "Marek Larwood ()", "Sarah Hadland ()", "Sanjeev Bhaskar ()", "Dave Lamb ()", "Jessica Ransom ()", "Tom Stourton ()", "Dominique Moore ()", "Richard David-Caine ()", "Lawry Lewin ()", "Katy Wix ()", "Katherine Jakeways ()", "Alexander Armstrong ()", "Lee Mack ()", "Warwick Davis ()", "Jamie Demetriou ()", "Kevin Bishop ()", "Samantha Spiro ()", "Ella Smith ()", "Daniel Renton Skinner ()", "Dustin Demri-Burns ()", "Tim Downie ()", "Chris Addison ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
