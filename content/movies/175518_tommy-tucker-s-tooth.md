It is an educational film, that combined live action and animation. I was surprised how little animation there was. But the scenes that blend live action and animation, though simple in our current day, were likely an interesting challenge for Iwerks.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fXul0oDbq7KrAnnn8eZf3OHwoZG.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Records (Jimmie Jones)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
