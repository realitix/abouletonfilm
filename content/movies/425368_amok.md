This seems to have been particularly the case for Europeans living in colonial establishments in Africa and Asia. In this drama, based on a story by Stefan Zweig, Dr. Steiner (Andrzej Seweryn) was caught with his fingers in the till at a German hospital. Rather than prosecute him, they gave him the option of emigrating elsewhere. He chose to serve at a clinic in a remote part of Portuguese Goa. He has been on his best behavior for years, but when the beautiful wife (Fanny Ardant) of a diplomat comes to him asking for an abortion, he is tempted to ask for sexual favors in return, and his life swiftly goes out of control.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pzwDlle9PBIlA4pOqr7BaHJBgVp.jpg", "actors": ["Fanny Ardant (Frau)", "Sonja Kirchberger (M\u00e4tresse)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
