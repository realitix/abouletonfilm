Ingeniously weaving extremely rare archive footage with meticulous recreations and the stirring music of John Philip Sousa, this film is both a moving portrait of the 26th president and a dynamic panorama of the great events of the early years of the 20th century. Among many subjects included in this cinematic mosaic are foreign policy, women's rights, Spanish-American War, aviation, conservation, the Progressive Party, and World War I. Music from the suites, operettas and marches of John Philip Sousa.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["George C.
