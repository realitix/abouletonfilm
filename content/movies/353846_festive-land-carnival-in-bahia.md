Carnival is the most expressive showcase of the unique cultural richness of Bahia, where African culture has survived, prospered, and evolved, mixing with other Brazilian influences to create forms found nowhere else in the world. The film captures this unique cultural energy through extraordinary footage of musical performances, dances, religious manifestations, and street celebrations.  At the same time, Carnival reflects the racial and social tensions of Brazil's heterogeneous society. At first glance there appear to be two million people chaotically mixed on the streets, but a more detailed look reveals how patterns of segregation driven by racial, social and economic differences continue in Carnival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oXsJAsjPVc6iJtObTqqQlhNZ249.jpg", "actors": ["Gilberto Gil (himself)", "Daniela Mercury (herself)", "Armandinho (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "tN315PygcoE"}
