Grant & Sandra Bernhard) into stealing works of Leonardo da Vinci for a gold-making machine that will destroy the world\u2019s economy. Danny Aiello plays Hawk\u2019s partner and Andie MacDowell his maybe babe. James Coburn is on hand as a top CIA agent. \r\n\r\nThe film advertises right out of the gate that it\u2019s a goofy comedy, a parody of caper/spy flicks. The creators & cast bend over backwards to amuse the audience, but there are too few lulls to catch your breath. It\u2019s an almost constant barrage of over-the-top camp and comedy. I laughed several times, but too often I didn\u2019t. Still, it\u2019s a likable albeit curious throwaway comedy and should especially be worthwhile for fans of the cast. It cost an incredible $65 million (no doubt due to the costly globetrotting) and understandably flopped at the box office.     \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 40 minutes and was shot in California, New York, New Jersey, Italy, Vatican City, Hungary and London. WRITERS: Story by Bruce Willis & Robert Kraft; screenplay by Steven E. de Souza & Daniel Waters.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C"}], "recommandations_id": [11074, 9319, 11517, 9208]}
