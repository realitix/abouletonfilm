Cutting cane by machete, they work 14 hour days, 7 days a week, frequently without access to decent housing, electricity, clean water, education, healthcare or adequate nutrition. The Price of Sugar follows a charismatic Spanish priest, Father Christopher Hartley, as he organizes some of this hemisphere's poorest people, challenging the powerful interests profiting from their work. This film raises key questions about where the products we consume originate, at what human cost they are produced and ultimately, where our responsibility lies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iFzCYOGUG7xIx1HpPCLChoQvNVe.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "NRU35rHYZko"}
