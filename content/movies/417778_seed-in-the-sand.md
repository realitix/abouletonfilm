He is carrying a precious white cloth pod sewn up with red stitching. On his journey, he meets a trio of gem-mining island-dwellers who are keen to have the pod for themselves. As he makes his escape from them, he encounters a ferocious blue sea monster that intends to drag him down under the sand to its lair.
