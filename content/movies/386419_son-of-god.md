But\r what starts out as a practical joke, extends to become a curious portrait of what could either be a petty fraud or the world\u2019s most secret miracle. A film crew tracks his bizarre pilgrimage as magic and religion, faith and doubt, real and unreal blur and melt to the point that one of the director becomes one of the characters. The film traverses all descriptions, before ending as both an affirmation of faith for the faithless and a criticism of faith for the overly faithful.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y4p319SgebK9Rbw8E2wtqji3m85.jpg", "actors": ["Ali Doron ()", "Michael Noer ()", "Kristine Kintana ()", "Sadged Cerna ()", "Lorna Garc\u00eda ()", "Arnold Guzm\u00e1n ()", "Menk Cruzat ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "041399jvqVU"}
