Witty, funny and moving, the film has crossed-over from Spain to become a classic family entertainment.On this particular occasion, Manolito is in the middle of Chrismas break and ready to celebrate the holidays with his nutty family: his mother, Cata, his father, Manolo, Grandpa and Imbecile. This year holds a big surprise: Uncle Nico, his mother's brother who lives an works in Oslo as a waiter. Uncle Nico shows up in an unbelieveable motor home to spend Christmas Eve with the family.\r He is accompanied by his flashy Norwegian fianc\u00e9e, Trudi Bergenkoklass, who is something like part fairy, part Viking and part Pippi Long Stocking. This lady immediately catches Manolito's eye.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jZoWhUZrmIBN8FQDUsIbWJbNAxV.jpg", "actors": ["Doro Berenguer (Manolito)", "Jos\u00e9 Luis Carrillo (El Imbecil)", "Rub\u00e9n Carrillo (El Imb\u00e9cil)", "El Gran Wyoming (Manolo)", "Vicente Haro ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [120506, 235443, 115360, 107673], "youtube_key": "hILskUR9VhI"}
