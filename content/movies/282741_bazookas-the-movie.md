Angus (Vinny Duwe) is the good son trying to keep the business going and Judah (Sean R. Brooks) is the weasel of an older brother trying to sabotage the gym so he can sell it! The two brother make a bet that will give control of the gym over to the winner and that's where the movie really shines!\r\n\r\nAngus enlists his employees (Angela Cohen, Nicole Galati, Jason J. Michael, Roberto Lombardi & Steven Nelson) to help him save the gym by introducing some sexy new classes, while Judah plots to destroy it with his henchmen (Joseph Campellone and Omar Portilla).\r\n\r\nBazookas is total slapstick, college humor in the vein of Porky's or Old School and is just as good (if not better) than most!"}], "recommandations_id": [298394, 282745, 282724, 282675], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
