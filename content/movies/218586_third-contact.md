The woman he has loved has vanished from his life 'forever'. Rene Maurer, one of his regular patients, has died - an apparent suicide. Rene's sister, Erika, traveling to London to sort out his things, discovers something curious - his apartment is almost empty. A cup, a spoon, a fork, a knife, frames without pictures, torn photos... One more curiosity - a list of memories. Four dated descriptions of moments in Rene's life. Another patient dies. Another list of memories. There's something strange going on. Something sinister behind these 'suicides'", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xFiV6Hj06EO14OUf4nFRX7nGbW2.jpg", "actors": ["Tim Scott-Walker (Dr. David Wright)", "Cristiana Dell'Anna (Theresa)", "Kristina Erdely (Helen)", "Geraldine Gallavardin (Dr. Moser)", "Jannica Olin (Erika Maurer)", "Virginia Popova (Enigmatic Woman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [83190, 232195, 49604, 27880], "youtube_key": "STwRi3rWa1k"}
