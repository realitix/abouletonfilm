That said, it wasn\u2019t an exact imitation and had enough to distinguish it; the original upped the ante in the slasher genre, which was in its infancy at the time, and obviously influenced movies in the soon-to-come slasher boom of the late 70s-80s.\r\n\r\nThankfully, this version of \u201cDementia 13\u201d is all-around better and in living COLOR. There are enough changes in the plot/characters to keep things fresh and interesting. It also eliminates confusing elements of the original, like the two bodies of water that weren\u2019t properly delineated. And, although 8 minutes longer, the film\u2019s still streamlined and doesn\u2019t overstay its welcome.\r\n\r\nYet the first half is superior to the second half, which is highlighted by the eerie introduction to the castle-like manor, the establishment of the characters and their story, as well as the stunning Ana Isabelle as Louise. Unfortunately, her part is rather small, but Channing Pickett (Rose) and Marianne Noscheze (Billie) are okay on the female front. Meanwhile Julia Campanelli is effective as the mentally dubious matriarch.\r\n\r\nThe situation speeds-up in the second half and the twists & turns are sometimes awkward, similar to the somewhat contrived & clumsy second half of \u201cPsycho II\u201d (1983). Still, the movie improves on Coppola\u2019s original and there\u2019s enough good here if you\u2019re in the mode for a flick that combines two horror genres: slasher and haunted house.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 23 minutes and was shot in upstate New York. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-"}], "recommandations_id": [408221, 532653, 450545, 513421]}
