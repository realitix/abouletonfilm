What's your emergency?\" Save me from this movie.**\r\n\r\nLet me start saying that I will avoid any spoiler but I will still get my point across. \r\n\r\nThis movie is not a realistic thriller-drama because it is so full of unrealistic events, from start to finish. Plot seemed interesting but it fell short rather quickly, featuring boring characters and most importantly a boring story. Ving Rhames is the only actor who manages to stand out positively. Special effects stand out too, but in a negative way because they are bad.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack was satisfying and the ending was enjoyable, the last 15/20 minutes. Another positive fact? It lasts less than 90 minutes.\r\n\r\n(4 stars out of 10)"}], "recommandations_id": [358397, 468201, 278632, 48319]}
