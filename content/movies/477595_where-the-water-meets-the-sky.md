In one of poorest regions of the country, where women rarely have the chance to speak out, a courageous group of twenty-three women produce a film about an issue that has affected them all, but few will discuss: the plight of young women, orphaned by AIDS. Inspired by the strength of Penelop, a young woman who agrees to share her story on film, the group becomes a force for change, showing how a single story can unite an entire community.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xdX05JS3gsVjqht5lYZhrz9NVb1.jpg", "actors": ["Morgan Freeman ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
