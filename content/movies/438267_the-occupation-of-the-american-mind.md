The Occupation of the American Mind takes an eye-opening look at this critical exception, zeroing in on pro-Israel public relations efforts within the U.S. Narrated by Roger Waters and featuring leading observers of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and U.S. media culture, the film explores how the Israeli government, the U.S. government, and the pro-Israel lobby have joined forces, often with very different motives, to shape American media coverage of the conflict in Israel's favor, and provides a sweeping analysis of Israel's decades-long battle for the hearts, minds, and tax dollars of the American people in the face of widening international condemnation of its increasingly right-wing policies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rCqkjI3mhLPaTnZYc0u4Okkycij.jpg", "actors": ["Roger Waters (Narrator)", "Rula Jebreal (Herself)", "Noam Chomsky (Himself)", "Norman Finkelstein (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "glvPUOFDnE0"}
