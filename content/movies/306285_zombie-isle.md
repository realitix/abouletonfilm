The class field trip quickly becomes a grisly nightmare as the students and faculty soon discover they are stranded and the island is crawling with ravenous, flesh-eating ghouls, reanimated as Zombies by an insane Nazi scientist who can resurrect and control the dead. Just when the slaughter levels out, a three-headed abomination comes out of hiding that even its creator can't control. A head smashing, blood splattering, intestine eating throwback to the zombie films of the 70's and 80's. Welcome to ZOMBIE ISLE... A fieldtrip straight to Hell.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hmJ6aosiBNL3iaawYN6d8rUKnlG.jpg", "actors": ["Kyle Billeter (Amie)", "Dewey Collins (Peter)", "Apryl Crowell (Laurie)", "Riva Gijanto (Crazy Zombie)", "Susee Garcia (Zombie)", "Catherine Goodson (Cindy)", "Leah Gosnell (Edie)", "Crystal Howell (Heather)", "Tony Jones (Professor Grant Foster)", "Jerry Eugene Long (The Sheriff)", "Alyssa Wheaton (Vulnavia)", "David Witt (Dr. Claude Von Wolff)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
