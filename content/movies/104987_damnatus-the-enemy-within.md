It follows a small team of mercenaries recruited by the Imperial inquisition as they attempt to infiltrate a suspected Chaos cult on the planet of Sancta Heroica. It appears that a rogue inquisitor is behind the cult and is attempting to summon a daemon for his own purposes, but the plot goes deeper than that, and it is not long before the heroes find themselves in way over their heads.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jvW71fM5ioD7VneA4VYGZGaxUqA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
