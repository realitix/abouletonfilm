Catalogue Vol. 4 takes the \u201cLighting\u201d catalogue as its subject and uses a pulse of electronic sound and light to rep- resent each fixture, shot in the order that they were found in the original catalogue. The intervals of black were derived by a matter of taste: items that the filmmaker found less appealing were excised from the sequence.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
