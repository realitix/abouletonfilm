As the mismatched pair struggles to complete the script and get a handle on their misdirected lives, they reveal the sometimes comedic, sometimes tragic behaviors of 'Generation Y'- a generation taught to believe each was incomparably special and messianically gifted. Though they begin to vie for the affections of the same girl, and their chance at success and happiness threatens to crumble, they ultimately each find their own, unique life truths.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/okIM23I0RVsxchF1kFRaNmK9Q50.jpg", "actors": ["Tania Raymonde (Tiffany)", "David Gallagher (Reid Davis)", "Ryan Eggold (Max Wolfowitz)", "David Thornton (Charlie)", "Tahyna Tozzi (Quinn Thorndike (as Tahyna Tozzi))", "Nathan Lee Graham (Barcelona)", "Edoardo Ballerini (Christos)", "Peter Y.
