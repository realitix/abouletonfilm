Does consciousness \u201ccontinue\u201d on a higher cosmic level, he wondered, or is it \u201conly an empty dream?\u201d Narrated by renowned baritone Thomas Hampson, this film explores the musical, biographical, and philosophical background of the monumental work. Viewers are treated to beautifully produced historical reenactments as well as interviews with many of the world\u2019s most respected Mahler scholars and biographers, including Henry-Louis de La Grange, Donald Mitchell, Morten Solvik, and others. Philosopher Martha Nussbaum and theologians Catherine Keller and Neil Gillman also add their insights. Woven throughout is a critically acclaimed performance of the symphony featuring members of the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra under the direction of maestro Neeme J\u00e4rvi.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Thomas Hampson (Narrator)", "Martha C.
