Fame, wealth and awards are his but there's a problem...he's lost his edge. He's no longer funny and the fans have begun to take notice... The solution? Return Vegas to his stand-up roots - The Edinburgh Fringe Festival. How? Kidnap Johnny and surround him with a mad lifestyle manager, a meglomaniac sponsor and his obsessive comic flatmate who should've been sectioned years ago. Then just sit back, watch his world fall apart and hope his new found misery means he can reclaim his place amongst stand-up comedy's finest with hilarious results! Succeed or fail, one question must be answered...Who's Ready For Ice Cream?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sE6wuLIRhxTlLT3GBNblA0xrsP1.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Vegas (As Himself)", "Tony Burgess (Tony Kenner)", "Tony Pitts (Kai Rydell)", "Adrian Manfredi (Angelo Wilson)", "Jeremy Hawksley (The Silent Man)", "John Bishop (Himself)", "Paul Putner (Journalist)", "Joanna Neary ((scene deleted))", "Sharon Gavin ((scenes deleted))", "Loretta Gavin ((scenes deleted))", "Brian Mitchell ((scenes deleted))", "Dave Mafield ((scenes deleted))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
