Shortly before the wedding, Dudley blurts a confession to his friend and best man, Jim Skippett: 20 years ago, Dudley had a brief affair with a certain Miss Piper, but he's never heard from her since then. Next day, who should suddenly appear? A youth about 19 or 20 years old, claiming to be named Joe Piper. Is he Horton's son, or is Skippett playing a practical joke?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/riIdklvEybjKARKnKunPMq1GQ5N.jpg", "actors": ["Leslie Henson (James Skippett)", "Albert Burdon (Joe Piper)", "Edward Everett Horton (Dudley Leake)", "Heather Thatcher (Anita Gunn)", "Alfred Drayton (Eustace Bogle)", "Robertson Hare (Allister)", "Wendy Barrie (Mary Bogle)", "Helen Haye (Mrs. Bogle)", "Joyce Kirby (Lillian)", "J.
