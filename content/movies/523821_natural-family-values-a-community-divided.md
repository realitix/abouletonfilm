The people are split between a religious majority, struggling to assert its conservative identity, and a vocal minority determined to make their home in a community afraid of change. Fearing a threat to their way of life, the mayor and city council unanimously approve a resolution. This defines the kind of families they would like to see move in as 'one man, one woman' with a 'full quiver' of children. Natural Family Values is an intimate portrait of a community at odds with itself, and what happens when democracy and theocracy clash.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/MlXzouft1JuNvxoSGDLygQLCkR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
