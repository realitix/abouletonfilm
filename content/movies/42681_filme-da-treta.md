In fact it all begun with a radio show (with that name) where two friends, \"Toni\" and \"Zez\u00e9\", talk about their lives and their neighbourhood (located somewhere in a typical district of Lisbon!). Because of the colloquial and comic language it used to be funny. Then it passed to the stage (kind of a dialog play) and later to a TV-show. As you can see it was a success here in Portugal and the audiences applauded it\u2026 Now, the film! \"Filme da Treta\" is, then, just an adaptation to the movies of this succeeded show, but it was, at least in my point of view, a regression! To be honest it was a disappointment, as I expected a lot more from it. I used to appreciate \"Conversa da Treta\", but now with the movie it lost all the fun!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qZAcC8H2fPpJN7sgMkzETEvji3M.jpg", "actors": ["Jos\u00e9 Pedro Gomes (Zez\u00e9)", "Ant\u00f3nio Feio (Toni)", "Maria Rueff (Zez\u00e9's Wife)", "Jos\u00e9 Raposo (Bifinhos)", "Marco Hor\u00e1cio (Z\u00e9 C\u00e1gado)", "Joaquim Nicolau (Ramalho)", "Ant\u00f3nio Melo (Galhetas)", "Teresa Madruga (N\u00f3quinhas)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
