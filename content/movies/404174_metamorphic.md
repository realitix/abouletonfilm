His images appear to be the carrying out of metamorphic dissolves. A bird gives way to the recognition of a house, which turns into fish, which turns into birds, and so on. Not a single flapping of wings takes place; everything is reiterated and fixed, becoming immersed in and re-emerging from a static continuum. All of Escher is an homage to one of the major animating forces of the cinema: the cross-dissolve. Precisely there, I found cinematic attitudes: in the house which turns into fish and in everything that transforms into something else. I gradually managed to figure out various types of non-existent sequences and then finally found myself dissolved, crossing over metamorphically.  \u2014P.G.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n0oXNImJ6z06u2raEu17gMXclBz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
