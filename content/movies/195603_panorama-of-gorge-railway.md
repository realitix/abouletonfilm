The camera in securing this picture was placed at the front end of a train ascending the grade at a very rapid rate of speed. The combined motion of the train in one direction and the water in the opposite direction, the latter impeded and interrupted in its course by the rocky path through which it flows, sending beautiful masses of spray and foam many feet in the air, makes an impression on the audience long to be remembered.\u201d (Edison film catalog)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aAgimFsJPyCM3zzioMaJVpB5EwZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
