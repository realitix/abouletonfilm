Traveling thousands of miles across the Russian countryside, the train stopped to have its film-makers document Ukranian harvest practices, steel production facilities in southern Russia and other industrial/agricultural matters. With each crew-member living in 1 sq. meter living quarters, all individuals on the train were responsible for various odd-jobs and other practical matters in addition to their own film-making concerns. - IMDb", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h1NJsVYrl7m14kSAXepsvvWLxQQ.jpg", "actors": ["Aleksandr Medvedkin (Himself)", "Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
