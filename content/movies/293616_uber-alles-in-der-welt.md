Ritter customarily produced morale-building propaganda pictures, and this, his first propaganda film to deal with the war, as well as his finest effort, was one of the highest-grossing pictures of the Third Reich. Set largely in France, England, and Spain, the film chronicles the plight of Germans caught by the outbreak of war and their frantic attempts to return to the Fatherland to join the battle. All of Germany's enemies receive equal disdain. The British, the French, the Poles, and the Jews are portrayed respectively as warmongers, profiteers and cowards. In the end, all that is important is returning to Germany.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8NwnBL53XWYSnvbxlGg2510nnfG.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Hartmann (Oberstleutnant Steinhart)", "Hannes Stelzer (Hans Wiegand)", "Fritz Kampers (Fritz M\u00f6bius)", "Carl Raddatz (Carl Wiegand)", "Oskar Sima (Leo Samek)", "Berta Drews (Anna M\u00f6bius)", "Joachim Brennecke (Willy M\u00f6bius)", "Carsta L\u00f6ck (Erika M\u00f6bius)", "Marina von Ditmar (Brigitte)", "Josef Dahmen (Unteroffizier Weber)", "Georg Thomalla (Unteroffizier Krause)", "Karl John (Oberleutnant Hassenkamp)", "Herbert A.E.B\u00f6hme (Kapit\u00e4n Hansen)", "Beppo Brem (Putzenlechner)", "Ernst Sattler (Rainthaler)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
