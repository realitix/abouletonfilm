The show was an intimate live event, that showcased the band's musical catalogue and included a rare live performance of \"Late Bar\".  There were only 150 tickets available for the event. The tickets could not be bought, and were be only obtained by winning them through DuranDuranMusic.com.  As the performance was for TV there were strictly no cameras allowed and the audience were placed in front and back of Duran Duran on stage. This allowed the band to communicate with the audience on a personal level, with Roger Taylor turning this back on many occasions asking if everything is fine and if there were any wishes for songs to play. John Taylor also commented how intimate the show was.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4mr6SHLZMwTdoxd7ootWCs2ifBJ.jpg", "actors": ["Simon Le Bon (Himself)", "Nick Rhodes (Himself)", "Roger Taylor (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "5LaTfjjyb8o"}
