Its way of fighting involved kidnappings and assassinations of government officials as well as representatives of foreign firms. The crusade of the military junta against its terrorist practices later became a pretext for state terror against civilians who had nothing to do with ERP. Gleyzer's so-called \"secret film\" records the kidnapping of a manager of the meat processing factory and cooling plant Swift. The partisans request an improvement in the working conditions in the factory in exchange for his release.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1zGTIIdRRWqC323Ov0tTnSm1E2E.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
