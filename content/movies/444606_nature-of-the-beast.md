An ex-miner, he was represented his community through the industrial action of the 1970s, the closure of the mines, and the slow drift to the \u2018centre-ground\u2019 within Labour politics. Famous for his sharp wit and unyielding style, Skinner has remained true to his roots, fighting for the disadvantaged and often getting himself into trouble in Parliament. The story of both a towering figure, and the fortunes of progressive politics in Britain over the last half-century.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ypVe7dTHTzxQw17CwRsmr5WWKEy.jpg", "actors": ["Dennis Skinner (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "dwt_yp1cmNk"}
