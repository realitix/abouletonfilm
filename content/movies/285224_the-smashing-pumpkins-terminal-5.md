Most clips were deshaked (Gunner Thalin) and cleaned using NeatVideo. Due to the intense lighting SP used this tour it's highly advised that you switch the playback resolution to 720p. Click the 360p button on the bottom right of the player to swtich to 720p HD. There was only one video source for Panopticon(Pit), Owata, My Love Is Winter, and For Martha.
