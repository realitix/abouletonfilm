KAZOKU NO KUNI tells the story of one of their number, who returns for just a short period. For the first time in 25 years, Sonho is reunited with his family in Tokyo after being allowed to undergo an operation there.  Sonho\u2019s younger sister Rie is at the centre of the film and is not hard to recognise as the director\u2019s alter-ego. In her documentaries DEAR PYONGYANG and SONA, THE OTHER MYSELF, Yang Yonghi told the story of her own life: at just six years of age, she had to experience how her three older brothers left the family forever, headed for Pyongyang.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AoFKsMYsJwZ8KdGF60njJ9eetEB.jpg", "actors": ["Sakura Ando (Rie)", "Arata Iura (Sonho)", "Tatsushi Ohmori (Hongi)", "Yang Ik-june (Mr. Yang)", "Jun Murakami ()", "Kotomi Ky\u00f4no ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
