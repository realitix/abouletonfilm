Jokichi of Mikogami, a drifter, has not yet fully revenged the death of his wife and son. He searches for Kunisada Chuji, who in turn has hired the knife-throwing Windmill Kobunji to kill him. Kobunji and Jokichi meet in the winter, near Sasago Pass, when both have rescued women: Jokichi has saved the lute-playing Oyae whose clan and whose lover want her dead; Kobunji has rescued Oharu, a well-born woman married to an innkeeper. Is this rescue a whim or something deeper? And why does Jokichi become the consumptive Kobunji's protector? What ultimately will Jokichi do about Oyae?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4uJPTAQ507SUaNbOPo4y2jsNrHJ.jpg", "actors": ["Yoshio Harada (Jokichi of Mikogami)", "Hajime Araki ()", "Kai At\u00f4 ()", "Takamori Gen ()", "Toshio Hosoi ()", "Renji Ishibashi ()", "Kusuo Kita ()", "Akiyoshi Kitaura ()", "Hachiro Misumi ()", "Hirasawa Nabuo ()", "Isao Natsuyagi ()", "Setsuko Ogawa ()", "Michiyo Ookusu ()", "Tamotsu Tamura ()", "K\u00f4ji Tsutsui ()", "Iwaki Yoshijiro ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
