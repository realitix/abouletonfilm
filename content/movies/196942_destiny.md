Considered a ground-breaking film in its native Guinea, and filmed amidst a storm of controversy, Mohamed Camara's Dakan is the first of its nations films to directly address issues surrounding homosexuality. The story centers on the romance between two 20-year-old men, Manga and Sory who are first seen making out in a car. The trouble begins when Manga tells his widowed mother about his love for Sory, who is busy contending with his outraged father. The parents insist that the two never see each other again. Manga's mother then uses witchcraft to cleanse her son and change him into a heterosexual. Time passes and eventually Manga begins to date a girl. But it soon becomes apparent that try as he might, Manga's heart belongs to Sory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pLrGZ3HeH8Bzv6aJobusMaDdNlO.jpg", "actors": ["Mamady Mory Camara ()", "Aboubacar Tour\u00e9 ()", "Koumba Diakite ()", "C\u00e9cile Bois ()", "Kad\u00e9 Seck ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [341961, 48697], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
