Exposing the unseen procedural activities of the museum, the material and exquisitely mundane qualities of these objects are disclosed. The leading protagonists\u2013analyst, patient (and tourist visitor)\u2014are present only in the objects\u2019 endless accumulation of dust and its painstaking, methodical removal. The artist\u2019s rendering of the ritual cleaning allows for a reverse gaze at Freud\u2019s personal collection and furniture\u2014alternately tender, projective and voyeuristic, as the conservator\u2019s brush sweeps the delicate surfaces of each object, or pulls back fabric upon fabric to reveal a couch\u2019s hidden structure. Through subtle parallels, these objects, processes, and the intimate empathy their simultaneous systems each suggest, are both mirrored and revealed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e8XuTRwN7bXg3o7y8mP6MiBy4Fp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
