The children, as young as two or three, have room and time to question, wonder, and learn. We build a wading pool, use tools, climb and swing, bath a dog - and learn to live together. There are spats, and little adult interference. A tree house sparks children's imagination. They visit a neighboring farm, play with the animals and ride on a tractor that's plowing. They eat and nap. There's story time, easels for art, and a lollipop. It's the perfect place for city children to be safe from bombardment, says the narrator.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7o0cy9rT0sHqd8XKcREwd8VnJnC.jpg", "actors": ["Lloyd Gough (Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
