Special Edition MVI", "slug_title": "riot-special-edition-mvi", "date": "", "genre": ["Documentaire"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "Riot! is the second studio album by American rock band Paramore. It was released in the United States on June 12, 2007 through Fueled by Ramen as a follow-up to their debut album, All We Know Is Falling (2005). The album was produced by David Bendeth and written by band members Hayley Williams and Josh Farro, with Bendeth, and fellow members Zac Farro and Taylor York co-writing on select tracks. The album is said to explore a \"diverse range of styles,\" while not straying far from the \"signature sound\" of their debut album,[1] with several critics comparing it to likes of Kelly Clarkson and Avril Lavigne. The cover of the album also resembles the cover artwork of No Doubt's Rock Steady. It is the first to feature guitarist Taylor York.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ja1ahx5ru9WYyWYSLtG0XN46Iwt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
