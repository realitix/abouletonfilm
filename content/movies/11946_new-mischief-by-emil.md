But even if he among other unfortunate mishaps causes his father to get stuck in the outhouse window and get bitten by crawfish, all is forgotten when he skillfully wins the family a free horse. And when Alfred the farmhand gets seriously ill, Emil puts his own life on the line, venturing into a snow storm to get his best friend to a doctor before it is too late.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/29X7sXESONlVkAGo1wOHD8v1Dvi.jpg", "actors": ["Jan Ohlsson (Emil)", "Lena Wisborg (Ida)", "Allan Edwall (Anton)", "Emy Storm (Alma)", "Bj\u00f6rn Gustafson (Alfred)", "Maud Hansson (Lina)", "Carsta L\u00f6ck (Kr\u00f6sa-Maja)", "Hannelore Schroth (Mrs. Petrell)", "Georg \u00c5rlin (Pfarrer)", "Bertil Norstr\u00f6m (Pferdeh\u00e4ndler)", "Paul Esser (Doktor)", "Rudolf Sch\u00fcndler (B\u00fcrgermeister)", "Stefan Grybe (B\u00fcrgermeister's Sohn)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [11945, 11947, 11626, 18815], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
