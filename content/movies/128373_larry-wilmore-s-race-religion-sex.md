Wilmore serves as host and moderator and will conduct man-on-the-street interviews to discuss what really concerns citizens. Instead of pushing forth either a right or left agenda, Wilmore prescribes to a \"passionate centrist\" point of view, allowing him to instigate a provocative dialogue as he dissects why race, religion and sex are vital in choosing the next leader of America.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hdY16xjUSiYx5CemdjfSSzBK7so.jpg", "actors": ["Larry Wilmore (Himself)", "Jeff Garlin (Himself)", "Andrea Savage (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
