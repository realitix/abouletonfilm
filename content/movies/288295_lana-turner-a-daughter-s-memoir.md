It's given extra credibility as it has huge input from the only child Turner had, the same daughter who knifed and killed an abusive lover Turner was trying to dump, and who thus caused the huge Hollywood scandal that devastated Turner's career for the rest of her life."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
