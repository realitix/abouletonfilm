They have failed, and during the timespan, many millions of computers have linked up together over the internet. In March, the fifty billionth computer went online, which was Robert Llewellyn's new Macintosh computer. All the interlinked computers begin reaching the complexity of a human brain. Then, the monstrously obese computer programmer John Silverstine noticed the link up. He called it \"it\u00b2i\u00b2\", for, following as Ren\u00e9 Descartes stated, \"I think, therefore, I am.\" So it\u00b2i\u00b2 agrees, \"It thinks, therefore, it is.\" Robert Llewellyn was making a documentary for the BBC about geek culture, when he became aware of this.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zheNCDh5bPtyo8Ytb9ggc2uXi4z.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Llewellyn (Robert Llewellyn / John Silverstine)", "Ed Clarke (The Mysterious Nerd)", "Tony Hawks (Head of Oftelcomnetcomwebnetwatch)", "Maria McErlane (Maria Leghorn)", "Lisa Rogers (Kirsten Google)", "Helen Statman (Nurse)", "Trevor Stuart (Dr. Trevor Stuart)", "Kevin Warwick (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "DIC_N5XueNQ"}
