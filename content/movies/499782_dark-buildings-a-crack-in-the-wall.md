But they all lie. The truth begins to unravel through the memories of Pablo Sim\u00f3. Pablo should carry out the unpleasant job of dealing with Nelson Jara, an indignant owner of the building adjoining a work of the studio, damaged by a crack in the wall of his living room caused by an error in the construction. But the fear and nervousness that provokes in the three involved the arrival of Leonor and her question \"what happened to Nelson Jara?\" Show something much darker and more suspicious.
