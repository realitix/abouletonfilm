So when I heard that the First Edition appeared on this DVD I decided to check it out. I absolutely love it. There are clips from his earlier career right up to the present. There are people like Lionel Ritchie and Mickey Jones giving commentary. There are a few First Edition Clips and his duets with the ladies like Dolly Parton and Sheena Easton.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sw7gIfYsat8J1IAir8w4vmoK2L3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
