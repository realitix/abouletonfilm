Murad Salem (Rushdi Abaza) is a very rich man who gets what he wants when he wants it, usually. After he meets a beautiful woman in Alexandria he wants her as wife number thirteen. The wealthy man is rather fickle by nature and has divorced a total of twelve wives so far. He more or less buys himself into the heart of the woman but then she learns from a well-meaning, former fianc\u00e9e of her husband just how many times he has been divorced. Forewarned is forearmed. The new bride then launches into a series of ploys that keep her away from the marriage bed -- until her husband begins to appreciate that she may be worth keeping around for awhile.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sNAlvsS0USVYtUt3N9bHOPnmv7v.jpg", "actors": ["Rushdy Abaza ()", "Shadia ()", "Abdel Moneim Ibrahim ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
