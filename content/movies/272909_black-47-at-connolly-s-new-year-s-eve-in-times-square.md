Using early footage of \"the best live band on the planet,\" interviews with band members and the audience, and the riotous performance itself, BLACK 47 AT CONNOLLY'S weaves together a history of the band's beginnings, and by extension, a rich underlay of Irish-American history and the Diaspora.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
