As Weissbach reads dryly from the document, including all punctuation and identifying information, the details of the case are revealed. The narrative, the narrator, and the film of the house itself become over exposed as Weissbach continues to read. The house becomes more obscured and the footage more frantic as the relationship between film and filmmaker is clarified.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p0xtYEFNGB4LCBstC6tqsQFw3VT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
