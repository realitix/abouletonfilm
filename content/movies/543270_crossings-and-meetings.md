This image and its accompanying sound are subjected to increasingly complex and proliferating configurations to arrive at what Emshwiller calls a \"visual fugue\" in time and space, structured like musical or mathematical sequences. The walking figure and its de-synchronized footsteps are multiplied, slowed down, accelerated, reversed, syncopated, overlapped and otherwise altered in multifarious variations on a theme, building in a kinetic, almost narrative progression of compositional relationships. The screen is finally transformed into a dance of motion by male and female figures in an abstracted, colorized space. Rather than an analysis of movement a la Muybridge, Crossings and Meetings is a celebration of the potential for representing movement in time and space through video.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ryLFRLrvv9gAgi1ozLlGlRGuHTL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
