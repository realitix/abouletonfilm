Not because of bad writing, animation, voice rendered, but the timing of the film coming out mattered. If this same film was released before 'Wreck it Ralf', 'The Lego Movie', 'Pixels', 'Inside Out', then people might have liked it. But now, it is like Sony desperately wanted their version of toys and/or games related film, so they made it. That's how it looks like. Despite all the criticism, the film minted good sum. So it is not a box office flop, only devalued honestly by those who saw it.\r\n\r\nThose titles I mentioned and this story has the same storyline. Basically, that's very common platform where 80 per cent of the films borrow from. The scenes looked very ordinary, like there's nothing much to explore. The jokes were weaker, the characters were uninteresting in most of the parts. I would say they did not utilise them rightly. The good thing is, it is a watchable film, but the majority won't like it. Usually Sony animations were met with underwhelmingly, and seeing the response it had got, surely there will be no sequel, at least for now.\r\n\r\n**3/10**"}], "recommandations_id": [137116, 268531, 324852, 332210]}
