Like the first two chapters in the Disorder Series, Freewheel Burning puts you on the edge of your seat and takes it up a notch with the biggest and baddest stunts freeriding has ever seen! Freewheel Burning sizzles with huge road gaps, bad ass bikercross, over the top dirt jumping and silly-fast single track that smokes the competition! freewheel burning is another fantastic entry. street riding makes an appearance. the new hell track is insane. we miss out on the unicycling and the handicap cycling, but its more than made up for by the rest of the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ktcdRtQacmZq61YhmaMWT0R4lU5.jpg", "actors": ["Wade Simmons (Wade Simmons)", "John Cowan (John Cowan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
