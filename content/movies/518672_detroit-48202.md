The resilient Detroiters on Wendell\u2019s route share stories of pushing against racial segregation in housing, challenging industrial and political disinvestment and living on reduced pensions as a result of Detroit\u2019s bankruptcy. They also share stories of hope and propose creative ways to re-imagine an inclusive, equitable and productive city. Foregrounding the voices of African-American working class Detroiters, it offers a nuanced and complex understanding of a city at the crossroads.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sETKLl2JQpzqa7sWT9KYdSpHSCl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
