Our heroine is the neglected child of a businessman father and actress mother. Feeling that happiness lies well outside her own backyard, Eva goes on a search for that happiness. The longer she stays away, the more her parents realize that they've unfairly ignored her. The plot is nothing new: it's what is done with it that pleases the eye and ear. Ingen tid til Kaertegn was one of the more popular entries in the 1957 Berlin Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8CIFDTDKuLGVErHXm3yZI6zEXFd.jpg", "actors": ["Lily Weiding (Mor - Skuespillerinde Maria Lehmann)", "Hans Kurt (Far - Direkt\u00f8r Mogens Vestergaard)", "J\u00f8rgen Reenberg (L\u00e6rer Harting)", "Bent Christensen ()", "Gerda Madsen ()", "Karen Berg ()", "Betty Helsengreen ()", "Evald Gunnarsen ()", "Grethe Paaske ()", "Preben Lerdorff Rye ()", "Mimi Heinrich ()", "Peter Malberg ()", "Sigrid Horne-Rasmussen ()", "Bodil Ipsen ()", "Jessie Rindom ()", "Knud Schr\u00f8der ()", "Svend Methling ()", "Asbj\u00f8rn Andersen ()", "Holger Juul Hansen ()", "Minna J\u00f8rgensen ()", "Vera Gebuhr ()", "Freddy Koch ()", "Ove Sprog\u00f8e ()", "Karl Stegger ()", "Mogens Wieth ()", "Axel Str\u00f8bye ()", "Povl W\u00f8ldike ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
