The video is a statement not only about time and progression, but also a statement about the world we have created for ourselves. The basis of the video contrasts the two extremes of life itself: the urban metropolis, and the beauty outside the city. I love to stargaze. Watching the milky-way float across the sky is one of the most therapeutic experiences I have ever felt. If you haven\u2019t experienced it, then I strongly recommend taking the time to do so.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gjv4g5bgV5FWkupJ046nRJ6j51z.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
