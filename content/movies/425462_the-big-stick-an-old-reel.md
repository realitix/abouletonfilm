What begins with Chaplin looping around in circular repetitions between a Keystone Kop and an ominous vagrant becomes more fractured as the film expands. News footage of police arresting protesters (shot from a television screen on black-and-white 8mm film) is cut into the comedy of cops and criminals (a shot of political reality through the slapstick fantasy) and images are abstracted by rapid-fire cutting. Even the physical cuts of the celluloid become part of the image as Levine chops through the frames themselves, leaving broad gashes on the screen and fracturing images until they overlap with the next shot and the suggestions of narrative are whirled into a frenzy of motion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7jABMXaNqjBxPy1Z3QZ3PQZDZzZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
