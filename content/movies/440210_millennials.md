Both in their early thirties, they are close friends but not a couple. What connects them is their urban background and their cosmopolitan attitude. Where they differ is their completely diverging approach to the little things in life. Their days and nights are full of possibility and yet nothing presents itself as inevitable. Anne is a successful director pursuing her career with singleminded determination. But she doesn\u2019t have much of a social life. Leo\u2019s head is in the clouds. He wants to be a photographer and is yearning to love and be loved. Their personal encounters and inspirational adventures cause them to realise the limitations of their varying approaches to life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6GIE8otss1FH6RmD6paRe0bYl49.jpg", "actors": ["Anne Zohra Berrached (Anne-Cathrin Marschause)", "Leonel Dietsche (Leonard Berger)", "Jan Koslowski (Yahn Siebenhaar)", "Anna Herrmann (Anna)", "Claudia Lorentz (Friend with child)", "Maria Dragus (Lisa)", "Lisa Hrdina (Maria)", "Claudia Pl\u00f6ckl (Claudia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
