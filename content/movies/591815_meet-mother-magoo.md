Magoo thinks that the flyer is a letter from his mother about her \"83rd birthday\" and begins to worry that maybe he hasn't spent enough time with his mother lately. He goes to pay his mother a visit to make up for lost time but upon arriving, Mother Magoo doesn't quite appreciate Magoo's attempts at being helpful such as baking a feather duster thinking it to be a turkey dinner. So she uses psychology to eventually persuade him to go back home (at least until next year).", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Pat Carroll (Mother Magoo (voice)(uncredited))", "Jim Backus (Mr. Magoo (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
