Beginning at New York's Seagram Plaza, one of the most used open areas in the city, the film proceeds to analyze why this space is so popular and how other urban oases, both in New York and elsewhere, measure up. Based on direct observation of what people actually do, the film presents a remarkably engaging and informative tour of the urban landscape and looks at how it can be made more hospitable to those who live in it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wlQTu1u41ZdkrNfKfgHt3GdjXpc.jpg", "actors": ["William H.
