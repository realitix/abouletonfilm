Carapiru is a member of one of Brazil's remaining Indian tribes, living in harmony with nature and making wise use of the local flora and fauna. But Carapiru is suddenly forced to fend for himself under unfamiliar circumstances when an unexpected attack leaves the rest of his family dead and their village destroyed. Carapiru flees into the nearby rain forest, and builds a new life for himself with the help some sympathetic settlers.
