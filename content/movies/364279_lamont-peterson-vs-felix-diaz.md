Peterson (33-3-1, 17 KO) is coming off of a debated loss to Danny Garcia in April, while Diaz (17-0, 8 KO) fought on the undercard that night, beating Gabriel Bracero in a ten-round decision. Diaz, 31, has really not stood out as a pro after winning gold in Beijing for the Dominican Republic, but he's got talent and might be someone who just needs a fight to get up for, and this is easily his biggest shot to date.  In the co-feature, we'll see two undefeated, tall welterweight prospects, as six-footers Prichard Colon (16-0, 13 KO) and Terrel Williams (14-0, 12 KO) meet in a 10-round bout, which replaces the canceled Andre Dirrell-Blake Caparello fight on the broadcast.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
