Now both are adults and are attracted to each other. Gayetri, who lives a middle-class lifestyle with her dad, Badri, and mom, Satyavati, in Madhavpur, is soon married to Vijay, but realizes that he is an atheist, while she is a devout Hindu, and worshiper of Lord Shiv, and it was perhaps for this reason that their marriage ceremony was marred by several accidents, including Vijay being mauled by a runaway buffalo, and a fire breaking out at the Mandap itself. Remake of Na Ninna Bidalare (Vijay, 1979).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/trFECWAcZP6pqLCNuyFlG6IFUtM.jpg", "actors": ["Rekha (Geyetri B.
