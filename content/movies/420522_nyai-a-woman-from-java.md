This woman loses her own name and is called Njai, which means a foreigner\u2019s concubine, and realizes that she is living in a kind of prison, while she deals with loads of visitors to her residence. Director Garin Nugroho shows in a distinctive way how much effort a woman, deserted both by the colonial country\u2019s law and the colonized country\u2019s traditional culture, puts in to retain her dignity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fBIwuLMglieH2WYutAKtx3ikaFO.jpg", "actors": ["Annisa Hertami (Nyai)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "2tTfe1psZU4"}
