Vapers have build a community together all with a common goal, and vaping should not be allowed to be controlled by the government. But unfortunatly goverments seem to have more power than the people as already seen in the EU and the USA. The EU has already wrongly classified e-liquid as a tobacco product under the Tobacco Product Directive (TPD) with its next goal being taxation."}], "recommandations_id": [366617, 513224, 338752, 54132]}
