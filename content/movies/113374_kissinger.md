This feature documentary will combine excerpts from the extensive interviews with extraordinary contemporary archive. The result will be a unique insight into the mind and personality of the man who, more than any other single individual, shaped the foreign policy of the United States - not only during his time in office, but afterwards, when he continued to act as consigliere to successive presidents as well as to governments around the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vd2ainbRRKxvVCJnmcTzmi82hSg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
