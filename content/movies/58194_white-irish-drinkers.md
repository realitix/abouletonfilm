Older brother Danny concocts a daring scheme to steal enough money for the two to escape, timed around the chaos of an upcoming Rolling Stones concert. The sensitive younger brother, Brian, ultimately has a choice: remain loyal to the brother with whom he shares a powerful love-hate bond, or use his hidden talent as an artist as his own ticket out of their dead-end existence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1J16LtpL9inmGUZsnmKJswO5VEB.jpg", "actors": ["Nick Thurston (Brian Leary)", "Geoffrey Wigdor (Danny Leary)", "Karen Allen (Margaret)", "Stephen Lang (Patrick)", "Peter Riegert (Whitey)", "Leslie Murphy (Shauna Friel)", "Zachary Booth (Todd McKay)", "Robbie Sublett (Ray Stone (as Robbie Collier Sublett))", "Anthony Amorim (Young Danny)", "Daniel Carpenter (Guy in Bar)", "Regan Mizrahi (Little Brian)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [47540, 120409, 71287, 89883], "youtube_key": "e3o7S5wsa0o"}
