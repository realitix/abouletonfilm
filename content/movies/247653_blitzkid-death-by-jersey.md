Fame is not a goal with this band. There are more important issues that the band feels should be accomplished. Such as leaving great music, song and memories that will stand the test of time. With a consistently growing worldwide fan base and an untouchable live show, BLITZKID is at the front of Horror-rock's blood-soaked future. Their music is an amalgamation of punk, metal, thrash, goth and rockabilly. It is romantic and melodically hooky musically, disturbing and gory lyrically and intense and devastating sonically.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
