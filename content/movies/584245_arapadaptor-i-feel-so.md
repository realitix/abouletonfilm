Most of the source material was unwittingly supplied by a Chinese herbalist. To produce Arapadaptor Geyer applied a flashlight and laser, a la Man Ray, to the caterpillars, cicadas and seeds of the herbal packages. Much of the original footage was further manipulated - painted, tinted and/or bleached. Finally, the images were rephotographed, slowed, through the use of an optical printer.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
