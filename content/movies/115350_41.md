For this state of just over a million residents, the devastation was profound, leaving unanswered questions and deep scars in its wake. But out of the ashes of the tragedy arose an equally profound story of hope. One year after the fire, a community theatre in the small city of Woonsocket gathered together to perform a play written by the fire's youngest victim close to the end of his life - a play that many felt could only be described as prophetic. \"41\" tells the story of Nicky O'Neill, the young actor, writer and musician who left the world at age 18 but who left behind a message. \"41\" weaves together the story of a life cut short, the saga of a community in mourning, and a family finding its way out of the darkness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/edN74H07T98cJIl5Stza31ExTKv.jpg", "actors": ["Nick O'Neill (Himself)", "Joanne O'Neill (Herself)", "Dave Kane (Himself)", "Gabby Sherba (Herself)", "Bill O'Neill (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
