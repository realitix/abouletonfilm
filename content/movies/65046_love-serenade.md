D.J. Ken Sherry arrives from the hustle of Brisbane to run the station; he's mid-40s, detached, thrice divorced, hatchet faced. But both sisters next door find him attractive: awkward Dimity, only 20, who works in a Chinese restaurant with few patrons, and perky Vicki-Ann, a hairdresser with a hope chest who invents a happy future with Sherry based on little but his arrival.

Then Dimity begins to smell something fishy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2WYt7hZ0q4xt9MJmBxBC3fjlhLl.jpg", "actors": ["Miranda Otto (Dimity Hurley)", "Rebecca Frith (Vicki-Ann Hurley)", "George Shevtsov (Ken Sherry)", "John Alansu (Albert Lee)", "Jessica Napier (Deborah 'Debbie')", "Jill McWilliam (Curler Victim)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [69040, 26195, 6360, 38007], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
