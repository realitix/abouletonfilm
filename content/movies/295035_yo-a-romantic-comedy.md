A Romantic Comedy, Trecartin borrows clich\u00e9s from hip-hop culture and genre films to craft a dark, dream-like narrative that veers from comic melodrama to goth fantasy. Applying his signature digital editing and delirious sound processing to remarkable effect, Trecartin creates an alternative narrative universe that suggests a kind of psychodramatic hyper-reality.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Lizzie Fitch ()", "Ryan Trecartin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
