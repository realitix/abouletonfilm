Fabian Gibbs plays a black Montreal college student forced to leave school when his girlfriend Pat Dillon becomes pregnant. Gibbs resents this interruption in his plans, but he becomes a very good provider. The responsibilities of parenthood, alas, irreparably damage the boy-girl relationship. Filmed in a quasidocumentary manner, Sitting in Limbo seems predestined to win film festival awards--as indeed it has.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/enrpWFB69MHyuJjjwOp0Z357VSi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
