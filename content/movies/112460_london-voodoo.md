As Mathers notices that the family is tearing apart and that his wife's behavior becomes more violent and erratic, he accepts that to save the woman he married he must take a leap of faith.  London Voodoo is one of the few films about voodoo to show the belief system in a positive light. Here, it's \"work\" that's evil. The film shows multicultural voodoo followers in a contemporary urban setting (London). As research for the script, the filmmakers travelled to Cuba, Miami and New Orleans to experience voodoo first hand.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qqOB0PStiebd1DQh3SxUztU12Bu.jpg", "actors": ["Doug Cockle (Lincoln Mathers)", "Sara Stewart (Sarah)", "Michael Nyqvist (Magnus)", "Trisha Mortimer (Fiona)", "Sven-Bertil Taube (Lars)", "Grace Sprott (Beth Mathers)", "Vonda Barnes (Kelly)", "Jacqueline Boatswain (Ruth)", "David Webber (Ray)", "Roy Borrett (Lee)", "Dickon Tolson (Jeff)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [42487, 40078, 28791, 60190], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
