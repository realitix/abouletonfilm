Marianela Nunez and Carlos Acosta perfectly portray the young lovers Lise and Colas, determined to thwart the plans of Widow Simone to marry off her wayward daughter to Alain, the simple son of wealthy Farmer Thomas. Osbert Lancaster's colourful, picture-book designs, along with Ferdinand Herold's tuneful score, arranged by John Lanchbery, provide the perfect setting for Ashton's blissfully bucolic ballet, complete with haywain, pony, maypole and ribbons, a cockrel and his chickens and, of course, the famous clog dance, here wonderfully led by William Tuckett as the irascible but lovable Widow Simone.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xS2PQp72O4BSc1yJCVxS5pQ7ak4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
