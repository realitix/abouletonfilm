The first play from the Classic Spring Theatre Company\u2019s Oscar Wilde Season, A Woman of No Importance will be captured live for cinemas from the Vaudeville Theatre in London\u2019s West End. An earnest young American woman, a louche English lord, and an innocent young chap join a house party of fin de si\u00e8cle fools and grotesques. Nearby a woman lives, cradling a long-buried secret. First performed in 1893, Oscar Wilde\u2019s marriage of glittering wit and Ibsenite drama satirised the socially conservative world of the Victorian upper-class, creating a vivid new theatrical voice which still resonates today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dPbmMomzMr4OfiA2egbal7ahRc1.jpg", "actors": ["Eve Best (Mrs Arbuthnot)", "Anne Reid (Lady Hunstanton)", "Dominic Rowan (Lord Illingworth)", "Eleanor Bron ()", "Harry Lister Smith (Gerald Arbuthnot)", "William Gaunt ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
