And forward, to the time they have left. On the one hand, there is regret \u2013 on the other, satisfaction. In a way, they are looking forward to the future \u2013 but at the same time, a longing for death regularly arises. And who is actually behind the camera? Are we watching actors or real people? Is there really any difference? Garten is full of contradictions \u2013 it is not until the credits roll that we realise who these people from very different backgrounds are.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2q1kJU9Ts5LCGmFsZIyfR265shx.jpg", "actors": ["Giuliana Pachner ()", "Awad Elkish ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
