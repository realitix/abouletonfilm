This formal motif - a blank frame or screen onto which the artist projects imagery which expresses inner emotions and anxieties - is a motif which recurs throughout Rimmer's filmic oeuvre. As Seen on TV is a moving film which conveys a deep-seated human experience.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6ak5iNRU38TbI8nYzsHwzRZUgWO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
