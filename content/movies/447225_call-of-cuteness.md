The cat\u2019s body is consumed, exploited and controlled. The fear of pain is greater than the will for freedom. Objects are fetishized and subjects are made into things \u2013 quantifiable and ready for use. They are the natural commodity for a luxury they are not even aware of. We are here, because you were there \u2013 and waste is disposed of in the sea. In the end, the bodies reveal the causes and effects of power, lust and hate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kHdHT46E5FSP3MFqnOMlKYSCi0q.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "cp4nK9RaMSc"}
