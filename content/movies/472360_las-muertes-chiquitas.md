Her interviews go beyond the \u201clittle deaths\u201d of the title, seamlessly moving between issues of sexual violence, political protest, love, family, and mortality. In a culture where sexual taboos run deep, what the women of Little Deaths have in common is a belief in liberation and self-discovery through sexuality, and a remarkable courage in the face of tragedy and oppression.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/40kPzrqa8MKoflMV3YCGWgmJylU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
