Junichi's world is turned upside down as apprentice teacher Anna-sensei (Hikari Mitsushima) scraps her lesson plan to show the rambunctious students about life as an adult. With Anna's unorthodox style, Junichi and his friends are able to gain confidence and pursue their goal of putting on a big concert. Co-directed with Kanoko Kawaguchi and Atsushi Yoshioka, \"Hello! Junichi\" brings out the kid in adults and lets kids be kids. Boasting Ishii's signature dance numbers and Yoshiyuki Morishita (the \"Japanese Steve Buscemi\") as the band's homeroom teacher, it's a unique experience built for future and current movie maniacs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4sfVD7WMdRl7uVxMq2mIwHYmHE4.jpg", "actors": ["Amon Kabe (Junichi)", "Hikari Mitsushima (Anna-sensei)", "Ryushin Tei ()", "Chizuru Ikewaki ()", "Tatsuya Gash\u00fbin ()", "Yoshiyuki Morishita ()", "Ryu Morioka ()", "Kanji Tsuda ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "iU8Ud5QdGi8"}
