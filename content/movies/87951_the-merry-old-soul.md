A tooth being pulled hangs on tight. Just then, the radio reports \"Old King Cole has the blues\" and Oswald races off in his car. He gathers up a collection of comics: Charles Chaplin, Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, etc. At the castle, they start singing off-kilter versions of Mother Goose rhymes, with Al Jolson in a blackface routine, and the king is quickly cheered up. Laurel &amp; Hardy haul in a large pile of pies, and an all-out fight breaks out. The jester, who has been getting jealous of Oswald, kidnaps him during the fight and hauls him into a dungeon, submitting him to various tortures, where we discover that the real torture has been the dentist pulling the tooth all along.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [100373, 213875, 64595, 145941], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
