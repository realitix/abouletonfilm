Strongly painted lips, printed dress with round skirt and red shoes matching the color of the lipstick, she catches his attention. He gives her a ride, the two of them stare in silence for a few moments. They introduce themselves to one another and between the two establishes an absurd dialogue and full of metaphors. And they are driving around in corners of Rio de Janeiro, to the sound of Noel Rosa and Lamartine Babo. Eva and Antena, she a seer, he, an assassin on the run, initiate an unusual case of love, a marginal love, where boredom often gives way to tragedy, creating the agony of a holiday spent in an abyss.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j7DQDkYxmhSV5OgW7cK8K1Xai4r.jpg", "actors": ["Joel Barcellos (Antena, o malandro)", "Maria Gladys (Eva, a vidente)", "Grande Otelo (Sinh\u00f4)", "Wilson Grey (Mudo)", "Sandra P\u00eara (Aurora)", "Kleber Santos (Estrangulador)", "Renato Laclete ()", "Guar\u00e1 Rodrigues ()", "Ivan Cardoso ()", "Radar ()", "J\u00falio Bressane ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
