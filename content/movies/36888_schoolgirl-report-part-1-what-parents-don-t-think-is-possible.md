The school's parent council discusses her punishment. One parent, a psychologist, suggests that her behavior is not abnormal or worthy of expulsion. He describes teen girls' experiments with sex, and these dramatized vignettes, interspersed with man-in-the-street interviews with young women about their attitudes and experiences, make a case for 60's generation's attitude of independence. The girls argue for telling the truth in the face of post-war German convention. In the end, will Renata be expelled or recognized as a girl from a new era?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fTDPBQZAHg8sbyjYXZ7smiCifNW.jpg", "actors": ["G\u00fcnther Kieslich (Dr. Bernauer)", "Wolf Harnisch (Schulleiter)", "Helga Kruck (Frau Dr. Vogt)", "Peter Dornseif (Herr Holm)", "Marion Haberl (Margit S.)", "Christina Hoeltel (Karin L.)", "Claudia H\u00f6ll (Lilo S.)", "Sandra Kruger ()", "Ruth K\u00fcllenberg (Frau Holm)", "Alexander Miller (Axel)", "Gernot M\u00f6hner (Theo)", "Gunther M\u00f6hner (Horsti)", "Gitti Netzle ()", "Mascha Rabben (Claudia F.)", "Karl-Heinz Otto (Vergewaltiger)", "Wolf Petersen (Ingenieur Hoffmann)", "Roswitha Randl (Michelle K.)", "Waltraud Schaeffler (Herma G.)", "Manfred Schrott (Narrator (voice))", "Michael Schreiner (Hermas Verabredung)", "Gundi Schw\u00f6bel ()", "Karin Simsel ()", "Franziska St\u00f6mmer (Claudias Mutter)", "Tonio van der Meden (Kaplan Reitmeyer)", "Hertha von Walther ()", "Susanne Woelfel ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [36886, 70609, 59871, 264959], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
