In the picturesque mountains of Val Lavizzara in Ticino, several individuals have come together to form a cooperative society and live such a life. There is a plethora of chores to be done on the farm: animals to feed, fields to plough and tree trunks to be chopped. As the year progresses, more and more issues surface dividing the younger and older residents: how much technology is acceptable? How much compromise is necessary and reasonable? Is the amount of work done in balance with the results gained?  Along with a poetic gaze, director Hans Haldimann also shows the sometimes extraordinarily complicated side to a \u2018simple\u2019 self-sufficient life. This may be far away from the hustle and bustle of the city, but there are just as many problems to be faced.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nXInwa7XzUkoYVHD8eGuEcqisfo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
