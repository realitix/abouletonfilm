The film combines footage from a beauty contest, religious procession, failed airflight, automotive and science experiments, animal experimentation, skyscraper construction, military paraphernalia, John D. Rockefeller and scenes of leisure, Richard Nixon and scenes of war, blimps and hot air balloons, and a sword swallower. Lipsett envisioned his film as a kind of cinematic time capsule for future generations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/beXySJNX4q9Ulr6rHwW9OchALzG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [131792], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
