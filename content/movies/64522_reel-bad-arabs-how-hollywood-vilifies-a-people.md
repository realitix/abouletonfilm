The film explores a long line of degrading images of Arabs--from Bedouin bandits and submissive maidens to sinister sheikhs and gun-wielding \"terrorists\"--along the way offering devastating insights into the origin of these stereotypic images, their development at key points in US history, and why they matter so much today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/alUcviVEaQo0cvgOLiDopwhqPDJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [176974, 56393, 130750, 32254], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
