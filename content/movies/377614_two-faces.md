The two main characters in that film were a prostitute and a junkie, and because of that, it was never shown on television. So I thought I would rework that film, copied those two faces and took the last two seconds of the film of the two faces and stretched them each to 12 \u00bd minutes. I made a 25 minute film out of two faces. - James Benning", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aHZQBMW0ectFmPOnPXoOaKEBiNI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
