War and Love are simply equated for what they are; the aftermath is inevitable, and a normal human condition, for which like the ancients one can only have pity and understanding. In this lies the mystery. All else is irrelevant. That there are other sub-currents of equal power in The Mysteries goes without saying; and, those who are capable of the numerous visual visitations and annunciations which the film offers them will realize what is the Ultimate Mystery of my work.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2PLZX2HVANTqESDM9zAqLMYeVss.jpg", "actors": ["Friedhelm Krey ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
