Using his camera to record a visit out east by train to spend Christmas with the family, Hancox .... used his familiarization with the annual ritual as a form of a script... Although we see the journey through the subjective judgment of Hancox\u2019s eyes, it is his intent to transfer the material from original event to camera, to editing, and finally to the audience, so that the personal content of the film... becomes universal.\u201d Michael Wade, Ontario Film Studies, Cinema Parallel  \u201cIt is the honesty of portrayal which is staggering, for instead of an idyllic image which many filmmakers present of themselves, Hancox presents (and thus, sees) himself without cinematic make-up... with \u2018wild sync\u2019 sound (reminiscent of an early film), and with the use of only available natural light.\u201d Richard Stanford", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6hFansfFeo4OHqYKyhk1GTTPhcK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
