It was because of the silence, explains Caro, one of those silences that sometimes fall in conversations when she has to come up with an answer to a question. Caro is 20 and she has Down syndrome. She met documentary director Mariana Vi\u00f1oles five years ago, and now here they are making a film together at Caro\u2019s mother\u2019s kitchen table. The method is utterly transparent: the camera points constantly at Caro, exploring her face, her arms and her hands \u2013 as if, together, they formed a landscape. Vi\u00f1oles asks questions and Caro responds. In addition to discussing her life, being in love and Pablo\u2019s wonderfully long kisses, she talks about what it\u2019s like to be making a film. All the time, life goes on as usual around them: a baby is slid into the frame;", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
