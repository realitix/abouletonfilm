Golovkin is the kind of brutal power puncher that fans gravitate towards, and his incredible string of KOs on HBO has earned him a great following. With that, HBO hopes to build him up as a future megastar in the looming post-Mayweather, post-Pacquiao era. But Geale is a talented fighter who should make this a scrap. Add in the Madison Square Garden crowd and you have the recipe for an exciting night of action.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zp8SDiPm4EqT0Rjuk6xFzabw4WR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
