Fan favorites dominated the first set of the band's 4-night TX/OK run, including \"The Floor\" and \"Booth Love\" from their recently released album, Death By Stereo (September 2011) - along with a cover of ZZ Top's 1980 hit single \"Cheap Sunglasses.\" Set two kicked off with some old-school favorites, \"Prowler\" and \"All in Time,\" and continued to pick up heat with a nearly 20-minute \"1348.\" \"The Linear\" > \"All in Time\" closed out the killer show.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8paKX81Nyh3Oip9bJBw89oVC3s0.jpg", "actors": ["Brendan Bayliss (Himself)", "Jake Cinninger (Himself)", "Joel Cummins (Himself)", "Kris Myers (Himself)", "Andy Farag (Himself)", "Ryan Stasik (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
