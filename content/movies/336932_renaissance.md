Filmed in two days, in July 1970, with a stolen film from the ORTF, this film, a tribute to these two vedettes of the French underground, is of immense beauty. The title is inspired by the silhouette of Pierre Cl\u00e9menti, evocative, for Lagrange, of the male physicist during the Renaissance. Grandson of L\u00e9o Lagrange and nephew of the chief operator Ghislain Cloquet, Yvan Lagrange is two years younger than Philippe Garrel. \"Renaissance\", his first film, shows to what extent his generation was influenced by Garrel.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ypxZZMi52KQ1GE6L3ojGFZiM4bj.jpg", "actors": ["Pierre Cl\u00e9menti ()", "Zouzou ()", "Bernadette Lafont ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
