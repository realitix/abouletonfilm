Their search for help only gets them lost, deep in the woods, where they meet Forest Ranger Bill with a penchant for scary stories. The campfire flickers long into the night as the ranger uses words to weave his tapestry of terror, filling their young minds with a host of horrific images that will be burned into your consciousness long after the fire's last embers have gone out. Insane doctors, Indian ghosts, bad drugs, a deranged handyman with shiny new shears - all that and more awaits anyone brave enough to stay until sunrise... if you live that long!\r - Written by Schleppy", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z2ZYSZ2Fpc9GqYus9qlMyqvoZvO.jpg", "actors": ["Rob McElhenney (Ricky)", "Charlie Day (Joe)", "Jamie-Lynn Sigler (Natalie)", "John Hensley (Donny)", "Joshua Harto (Teddy)", "David Johansen (Ranger Bill)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [38246, 45322], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
