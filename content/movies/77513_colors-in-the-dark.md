They have two grown children, and their grandchildren are finishing school. Both can look back at a fulfilling past, but their lives are still rich and vibrant. The fact that Fred is terribly ill has been hidden from the family. For the first time in all these years, Fred takes some liberties, which his wife interprets as an affront. Never before has she felt so abandoned. Although she starts to question her relationship, a love like theirs cannot end so easily. Indeed it should never end.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dVmY43RDdJxntHEBaXcw3U7deRg.jpg", "actors": ["Bruno Ganz (Fred)", "Senta Berger (Anita)", "Barnaby Metschurat (Patrick)", "Carina N.
