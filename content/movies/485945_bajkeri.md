The pressure of parents is forced to go under the leadership of David's charming \"stepmother\" Tereza on a twenty-kilometer bicycle trip, surprisingly finding out there is a real world out there in which life means more than facebook status, real girls look a little better than cartoon action heroes of virtual games and love also include sex.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wtMsQv4VbiZfnFQlxjzIzf8FCqV.jpg", "actors": ["Adam Mi\u0161\u00edk ()", "Hana Vagnerov\u00e1 ()", "Jan Kom\u00ednek ()", "Vojt\u011bch Machuta ()", "Jakub \u0160t\u00e1fek ()", "Pavel Ne\u010das (Z\u00e1horsk\u00fd)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
