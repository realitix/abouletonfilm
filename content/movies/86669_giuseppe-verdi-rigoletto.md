While Gilda na\u00efvely gives credence to the Duke's amorous advances, he is concerned only with constantly changing erotic relationships, of which he boasts in his famous aria Questa o quella. Rigoletto fails. A terrible curse uttered against him by Count Monterone, whom he had once ridiculed before the entire court, comes true: at the end he holds his beloved daughter dead in his arms.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8yOCja4BxSa8w7PlSprrg10kTmZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
