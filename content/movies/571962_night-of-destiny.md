He's spotted by the assailant, but Slimami manages to slip away before being caught. The victim turned out to be a prominent businessman, and police are soon searching for the witness as well as the killers. Slimami does not want to step forward, both as a matter of personal safety and because he prefers to let the French police handle their own affairs. His son Alilou, a budding journalist, openly decries the failure of the witness to come forward as a black mark on the Muslim community in Paris, unaware that the man in question is his father.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pfDxi0xQ4EMiPvNl7WfaMW1MsV7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
