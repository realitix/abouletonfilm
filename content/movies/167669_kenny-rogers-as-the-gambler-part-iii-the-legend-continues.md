This is the moment when the continuation is not worse than the previous parts. The film tells how people are <a href=\"http://concours-bookin.com/\">betting in texas holdem</a> and what they are ready to do for the victory. This movie just takes you from the first minutes. You do not even notice how fast these four hours are passed. The main actors are incredibly charismatic, they hide their eyes and completely transmit all the emotions of the heroes. I recommend you to watch this movie. Do not spoil for a while! This movie will hit you and I will give you a word that you will not regret!"}], "recommandations_id": []}
