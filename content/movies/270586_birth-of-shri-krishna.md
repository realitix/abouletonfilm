The child god Krishna rises out of the water astride the demon snake Kaliya. Then we see Yashoda as she rocks the sleeping Krishna's crib and imagines the god as Gopala. The next scene shows Kamsa fantasizing about Krishna threateningly duplicated many times around him. Kamsa then imagines himself dead as his severed head rises up and descends again. People of all castes pay obeisance to the deity with the title-card: 'may this humble offering be accepted by the Lord'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xf7of39IFDO4BrJjkDXflN7BlKz.jpg", "actors": ["Bhagirathibai ()", "D.D.
