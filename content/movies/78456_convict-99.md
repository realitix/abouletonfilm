Believing he is being sent to a school rather than a prison, he celebrates accordingly only to find that his drunkenness accidently lands him on the wrong side of the prison bars. The Governorship is eventually restored to him, and he sets about popularising himself amongst the convicts by turning a blind eye to their shady dealings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8BneokpmHwpkn9viHTC7tLebXNj.jpg", "actors": ["Will Hay (Dr. Benjamin Twist)", "Moore Marriott (Jerry The Mole)", "Graham Moffatt (Albert Brown)", "Googie Withers (Lottie)", "Peter Gawthorne (Sir Cyril)", "Basil Radford (Deputy Governor)", "Wilfred Walter (Max Slessor)", "Dennis Wyndham (Head Warder)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [97103, 208374, 78459, 108375], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
