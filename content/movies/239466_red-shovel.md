The approach to image is very painterly with the simple view transformed \u201cwith Turneresque luminosity.\u201d Most of the unusual visual effect is from the careful use of a shallow depth of field and natural objects (blowing grass, bushes, etc.) to bend and twist the images into a languid sense of time. In the end the film documents a state of mind more than a particular spot. It also resonates with the ambiguous metaphoric threat of a national symbol impinging upon the child\u2019s toy.  - Canyon Cinema", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gj4JnRaocW5l0lH9EHvB3QYZCP8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
