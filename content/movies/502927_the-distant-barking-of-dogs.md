Sometimes these sounds are in the distance, while other times they\u2019re frighteningly close. While many have already left this dangerous area, Oleg remains with his grandmother, who has taken care of him since the death of his mother. They have nowhere else to go. While waiting for the war to end, Oleg enjoys hanging out with his younger cousin Yarik and the older boy Kostia. Together they go on adventures, talk about what makes a real man, test each other\u2019s boundaries \u2014 but sometimes they go too far. This observational film follows a year in the life of Oleg, and emphasises the warm bond he has with his grandmother. By sticking close to Oleg, The Distant Barking of Dogs shows the effect of conflict on children.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pXo76L6UUjoH7kPpwqNUjgAVCeu.jpg", "actors": ["Oleg Afanasyev (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "243103068"}
