Nearly every major bone in Janelle's body was broken and her organs pushed into her chest, forcing doctors to place her in a medically induced coma. As Morrison slept, doctors worked hard to reassemble her broken body, questioning whether she would ever walk again. Janelle's recovery was nothing short of miraculous, astonishing doctors every step of the way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7NwoapFmBgnRJtkWUjLB3MqAupd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "hC3t3OwrcvM"}
