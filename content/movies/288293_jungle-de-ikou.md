Little does Natsumi know that the statue houses Ongo, a terrible monster bent on world conquest. In a dream, a strange old man named Ahem warns Natsumi of Ongo's return, and gives her a necklace and tells her to do a sexually suggestive dance that will protect her from peril. Once Natsumi awakens, she finds Ongo on her bed...who's not too threatening looking. But now whenever danger rears it's ugly head, Natsumi must swallow her modesty, and do the embarrassing dance to transform into Mii, the large breasted flower spirit of New Guinea's past.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sL2UGVEH5YAcMN0czWeGHISnHQ8.jpg", "actors": ["Eri Sendai (Mii / Natsumi Rokudo)", "Megumi Hayashibara (Ongo)", "Sumi Shimamoto (Rongo)", "Kaneta Kimotsuki (Aham)", "Kappei Yamaguchi (Takuma Kusanagi)", "Sumie Baba (Nami Kuki)", "Ry\u00fbnosuke \u00d4bayashi (Fuyuhiko Rokudo)", "Mako Hyoudou (Haruka Rokudo)", "Satohiko Nakajima (Itsuki Kusanagi)", "Alex Korenori (American Soldier)", "Akiko Yajima (Manami Izumikawa)", "Hatunori Miyata (American Soldier)", "Shigeru Sakano (Additional Voices)", "Fumihiko Tachiki (Ryoubaninn De Niro)", "Takehiro Murozono (Additional Voices)", "Yuko Takase (Additional Voices)", "Natsumi Sasaki (Additional Voices)", "Uko Takase (Additional Voices)", "Katsumi Masago (Additional Voices)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
