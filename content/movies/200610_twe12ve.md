In a time where technology and the energy of our planet are accelerating off the charts and Mother Nature's confusion can no longer be explained away by experts.

Twelve riders having a blast, redefining the limits of what is possible. Absinthe brings you the next wintry shred classic: Twel2ve.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pEf3fofDKga1fzuXVLy34J3MrQo.jpg", "actors": ["Dan Brisse ()", "Johnnie Paxson ()", "JP Solberg ()", "Lucas Debari (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
