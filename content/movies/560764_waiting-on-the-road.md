The owner of the brothel, Madame Lili (Darlene Gl\u00f3ria) is abandoned by her 3 daughters who worked in the house, but they left 2 kids for her to take care of: Br\u00e1s (Rique Messias) and Concei\u00e7\u00e3o (Luana Valentin). Br\u00e1s spends his day digging holes in the road to break the few trucks that cross the road, so they can stop at their house. Concei\u00e7\u00e3o is kept hidden when a customer comes because her grandmother has big plans for her: to marry her with a good man, so the curse of prostitution can end in the family. Meanwhile, Meota (Jackson Antunes), an old truck driver, returns frequently to \u201cBei\u00e7o de Estrada\u201d to win the heart of little Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, while dodging her grandmother.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mf6EGTPRRO917iXl1IiKAY8euXH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
