The second part manipulates time, a wordless portrait of clay vessels being produced in Morocco that slows down and speeds up without warning, imbuing unspectacular actions with detachment and wonder. The third part distorts space, a hand camera tour that moves through apparently connected locations as if carrying out a single movement, although these industrial facilities, cityscapes, meadows and exhibition spaces are not side by side but scattered across the globe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ng7uLiUr2k0bjhPrH0ZTGtAMqR4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
