Force became a means to wrestle with this tension. As the discourse of a \u201ccountry torn\u201d finds its way into mainstream political analyses (for many the deep divisions in this country are not a new political reality), we should reflect on the writings of political dissidents and radicals. We should recognize the diversity of political analysis that is very much alive. The histories of armed struggle, if taken seriously, provide us with a means to think more critically about the center, and complicate its claims of moral and political right.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/grm5w8NwQCogUs4aTquEkmgAEHB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
