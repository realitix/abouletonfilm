What was not good to see was a couple of these actors get to work on _Stillwater_. That I probably could have done without. It's hard to know if _Stillwater_ could have been great with some reworking and recasting or not, but in either case it's not important, because this is the movie we got, and it is... Not very good. There's some potential, and some commentary that may or may not have been intentional, but I'm afraid I can't send you out to see _Stillwater_.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}], "recommandations_id": [441762, 416724, 490004]}
