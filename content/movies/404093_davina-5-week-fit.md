I'm back and I'm so excited.... I love the fact that you loved 7 Minute Fit. Some of the results you've sent me have been truly AMAZING!!! This year we are building on everything we did in 7 Minute Fit. Still the same targeted approach and variety of workouts but we've stepped everything up a notch. Ed's designed brand new high-intensity 7 minute workouts and this year each workout comes with an extra 3 minute booster for those of you that have the time and really want to go for it. We've also got an incredible abs session that targets the lower tummy, flattening it to give that unbelievable definition. Love that!!! We've also got the ultimate fitness challenge - a 21 minute workout that's there to really test your stamina, your strength and to work your core, all at once. It's crazy amazing. AND.... For the very first time this programme has been designed to work as a complete 5 week workout programme, to get you 5 Week Fit.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wlvK3jau4lx002NB0EEDWSfyeRy.jpg", "actors": ["Davina McCall (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
