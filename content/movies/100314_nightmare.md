Molly Duggan is determined to discover a treatment, because in rare cases, it can kill: Her mother was one of its victims. But what science can't explain is why Molly suddenly starts experiencing episodes herself and during them, feels a sinister presence surrounding her. So she turns to legends, and that's when her real nightmare begins. Haylie Duff stars in this pulse-pounding chiller.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kPAC974HMe6fjhR2ngrnb5CbLET.jpg", "actors": ["Haylie Duff (Molly Duggan)", "Gwynyth Walsh (Dr.Edmonds)", "Jesse Hutch (Gavin)", "Meghan Ory (Carla)", "Bruce Ramsay (Silas)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
