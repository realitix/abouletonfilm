But the partner Digimon that they've reunited with have lost their memories. While Sora normally thinks of others even before herself, she now has distrust in her heart. A tearful Meicoomon appears and disappears again. For some reason, she has retained past memories, and is searching for Meiko. Upon seeing Meicoomon, the kids resolve to journey through the Digital World to save her, but a man with the Dark Masters at his command stands in their way. Meanwhile, in the real world, Nishijima receives a notice that Himekawa has disappeared. When he investigates, he learns that she has had a hidden goal behind all her actions thus far.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rbTOYEesS4pLLMUuja5V8cAzTrx.jpg", "actors": ["Natsuki Hanae (Taichi Yagami (voice))", "Yoshimasa Hosoya (Yamato \"Matt\" Ishida (voice))", "Mao Ichimichi (Hikari Yagami (voice))", "Suzuko Mimori (Sora Takenouchi  (voice))", "Jun'ya Enoki (Takeru Takaishi (voice))", "Mutsumi Tamura (Koushiro Izumi (voice))", "Hitomi Yoshida (Mimi Tachikawa (voice))", "Junya Ikeda (Jo Kido (voice))", "Chika Sakamoto (Agumon / WarGreymon (voice))", "Kinoko Yamada (Palmon (voice))", "Mayumi Yamaguchi (Gabumon / MetalGarurumon (voice))", "Miwa Matsumoto (Patamon / Angemon / MagnaAngemon / Seraphimon (voice))", "Junko Takeuchi (Gomamon (voice))", "Takahiro Sakurai (Tentomon / Kabuterimon / MegaKabuterimon / HerculesKabuterimon (voice))", "Atori Shigematsu (Piyomon / Birdramon / Garudamon / Hououmon (voice))", "Yuka Tokumitsu (Gatomon (voice))", "Miho Arakawa (Meiko Mochizuki (voice))", "Yukiko Morishita (Meicoomon / Meicrackmon Vicious Mode (voice))", "Yuko Kaida (Maki Himekawa (voice))", "Daisuke Namikawa (Daigo Nishijima (voice))", "Hiroaki Hirata (Mysterious Man (voice))", "Shunsuke Takeuchi (Hackmon (voice))", "Yasuhiro Takato (Elecmon (voice))", "Kaori Ishihara (Bakumon (voice))", "R.
