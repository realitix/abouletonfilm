From actor/actresses to set workers, 400 women and men have started a 5-day-long walk to Ankara. A walk that was conceived with supportive but surprised looks of the public. The documentary tries to picture this forgotten but historical event in the light of the 100th year of cinema.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xbuTn9KOJneUj95LlmY4KIOaikP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
