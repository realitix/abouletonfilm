Obligingly, Jasbir destroys the evidence. Ranjit finds himself being plagued by the restless spirit of Kajal as well as a suspicious policeman. Seeking respite in Bombay, he is stunned to see Kajal's doppelganger, a nurse called Kiran. Unnerved, he brings Kiran home with him and finds himself falling in love again.
