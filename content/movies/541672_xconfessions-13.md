Erika Lust's award-winning XConfessions series has reached it's 13th volume, collating in chronological order the latest (and a couple of as yet unreleased) films.  Crawling, stomping, dancing and fucking in the mud is the order of the day from returning Guest Director Nuria Nia in Mud Dance, featuring Bishop Black and Lucy Huxley.  In Sex Work is Work Parts 1 and 2 Erika Lust confronts, head on, the dichotomy of stigma and power that all sex workers face. Lust combines intimate, complex interviews with her performers, alongside a full length real cam session with American cammers Moth & Rust, and a documentary following Maria Riot as she hires Dante Dionys as an escort.
