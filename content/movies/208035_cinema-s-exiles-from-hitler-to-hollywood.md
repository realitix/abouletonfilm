The film uses voice-overs, archival footage, and film clips to examine Berlin's vital filmmaking in the 1920s; then it follows a producer, directors, composers, editors, writers, and actors to Hollywood: some succeeded and many found no work. Among those profiled are Erich Pommer, Joseph May, Ernst Lubitsch, Fritz Lang, Billy Wilder, and Peter Lorre. Once in Hollywood, these exiles helped each other, housed new arrivals, and raised money so others could escape. Some worked on anti-Nazi films, like Casablanca. The themes and lighting of German Expressionism gave rise in Hollywood to film noir.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qAeT19347Snim7yACxa34HqFVHX.jpg", "actors": ["Sigourney Weaver (Narrator)", "Marlene Dietrich (Herself (archive footage))", "Hedy Lamarr (Herself (archive footage))", "Elsa Lanchester (Herself (archive footage))", "Peter Lorre (Himself (archive footage))", "Billy Wilder (Himself (archive footage))", "Fritz Lang (Himself (archive footage))", "Lupita Tovar (Herself (archive footage))", "Fred Zinnemann (Himself (archive footage))", "Peter Viertel (Himself (archive footage))", "Rudi Fehr (Himself (archive footage))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
