A King of the Forest gathers elves, sprites, and other assorted woodland spirits for a night of festivities. The spirits frolic, dance, drink, and romance. Conflicts arise and are resolved. The puppetry here is top-notch, and the rear-projections of fire and water add an extra depth to the magical world. A trip to a mysterious and happy world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1GOcJ2KqdghmqTNxNOoIkpJfxe8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
