Covering a period of 18 months, the film follows the activities of a group of young men in their 20s who have finished their schooling and stayed in their home village - they loaf about unemployed since they can\u00b4t find any work in the remote district. The main characters are more or less idle young fellows whose stories link together and make up the film. Tinged with humour, The Idle Ones is a story about frustrated but vital young people in a period of transition, waiting for something to happen. For some, the waiting is becoming their life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ggNlGiCOLhx7CrTN2F6CD4JsFpT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [139553, 50988], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
