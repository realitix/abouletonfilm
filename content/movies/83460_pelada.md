Tucked away on alleys, side streets, and concrete courts, people play in improvised games.  Every country has a different word for it.  In the United States, we call it \u201cpick-up soccer.\u201d  In Trinidad, it's \"taking a sweat.\"  In England, it's \"having a kick-about.\"  In Brazil, the word is \u201cpelada,\u201d which literally means \"naked\"\u2014the game stripped down to its core.  It\u2019s the version of the game played by anyone, anywhere\u2014and it\u2019s a window into lives all around the world.  Pelada is a documentary following Luke and Gwendolyn, two former college soccer stars who didn\u2019t quite make it to the pros.  Not ready for it to be over, they take off, chasing the game.  From prisoners in Bolivia to moonshine brewers in Kenya, from freestylers in China to women who play in hijab in Iran, Pelada is the story of the people who play.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xAoZZLjEofoENs06IxtovzoMqxP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "BfLEcfH8OL4"}
