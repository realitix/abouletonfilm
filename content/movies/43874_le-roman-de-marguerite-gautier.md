In comparison to the 1921 silent version, Cukor's a much better director, though Rudolph Valentino's better as Armand Duval. Both versions are intriguingly different, and Henry Daniell's just great as the villainous Baron. Essential viewing, especially for fans of Garbo and classic tearjerker films."}], "recommandations_id": [70881, 31526, 31511, 1976]}
