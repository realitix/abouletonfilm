Here the protagonists are an accident-prone worker and a ballerina-manager who has the tools to alleviate the worker\u2019s problems.  At the center of the piece is the color equation, Red + White = Pink, from which multiple parallel meanings emerge. The first is the old term \u201cpinko,\u201d meaning a watered down Communism, or a liberal with uncommitted Red sympathies. The second is a proposal to solve future crises in meat supply by re-valuating hot dog and sausage production as a solution, by integrating \u2018undesirable\u2019 portions of pig with the \u2018desirable\u2019 portions, embodying perfect equivalence in consumable form. And the third is pink as femininity \u2013 not as a \u2018natural\u2019 fleshy softness, but rather a synthetic, engineered (and potentially violent) hybridity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s0vTKLg82CHGBr0EOr5cd2ut7qC.jpg", "actors": ["Katharine Liu (Accident-Prone Worker)", "Mayu Oguri (Manager Ballerina)", "Corey Tazmania (Narrator)", "Isabelle Zufferey Boulton (Narrator)", "Eli Condon (Company Dancer)", "Jasmine Hong (Company Dancer)", "Nathalie Encarnacion (Company Dancer)", "Maura Harris (Company Dancer)", "Sorcha Fatooh (Company Dancer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
