While doing research for the film, we had intimate and candid conversations with kids in middle school classrooms, suburban shopping malls, nightclubs, college dorms, and even conducted an informal roundtable during a high school house party. While chronicling trends among small town and big city kids, we discovered this: Having pubic hair is considered unattractive and \u201cgross.\u201d Most youngsters know someone who has emailed or texted a naked photo of themselves. Many kids have accidentally or intentionally had their first introduction to sex be via hardcore online porn. Facebook has created an arena where kids compete to be \u201cliked\u201d and constantly worry about what image to portray \u2013 much of what was once private is now made public. And the list goes on.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mno7Im3vPKWlp8XN9kVsubxFWvQ.jpg", "actors": ["Winnifred Bonjean Alpart ()", "Jennifer Bonjean ()", "Ken Alpart ()", "Nichole Romagna ()", "Nichole Romagna ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [37405, 47841, 46228, 62984], "youtube_key": "JeD_RztXeko"}
