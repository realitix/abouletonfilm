As the war continues to intensify, the family is forced to migrate west to the city of Istanbul. While Haydar and Isa Altun decide to stay in Turkey with their young children, Davut Altun and his family migrate north to Norway, enlisting the help of smugglers. They eventually reach their destination and find work in a supermarket, but life as refugees proves relentless. Back in Istanbul, Haydar watches over the family as his wife undergoes an operation due to pregnancy complications. Their son makes friends with a group of transvestites, helping him to understand why he has felt different all of his life. While liberating, his newfound identity is seen as a disgrace to the rest of his family, leading him to flee from the abuse it produces.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iSrnCMsG0lfWVSy4RwnSKUK3Orb.jpg", "actors": ["Mahsun K\u0131rm\u0131z\u0131g\u00fcl (Ramo)", "Demet Evgar (Havar)", "Murat \u00dcnalm\u0131\u015f (Mamo)", "Altan Erkekli (Davut)", "Erol Demir\u00f6z (Haydar)", "Cemal Toktas (Kadri)", "Menderes Samanc\u0131lar (Cuma)", "Emre K\u0131nay (Musto)", "Ayta S\u00f6zeri (Tuana)", "Bu\u011fra G\u00fclsoy (Berat)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [53325, 27956, 48763, 27947], "youtube_key": "acwoxq0NL14"}
