To enhance her latest project, Warren invites the participation of anonymous phone callers, whose voices she records. One of her unseen \"collaborators\" calls her up to confess to a murder--several murders, in fact. Warren strongly suspects that the mystery caller may be intending a little \"performance\" involving her own demise.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t10jj1b42cvNqg2bLZBaTPr4Ivh.jpg", "actors": ["Lesley Ann Warren (Lily)", "Peter Weller (Rad Hungate)", "George Loros (Frank)", "John Glover (Philip)", "Jimmie Ray Weeks (Claude)", "Harvey Fierstein (The derelict)", "Charles S.
