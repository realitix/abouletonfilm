Witwer. Each episode was self-contained and complete in itself. Formerly wealthy Kane Halliday (Reginald Denny), finds he must support himself with his fists in the ring after his father goes suddenly broke. A great mix of comedy and action set against the gritty world of the old New York boxing scene.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tLJXGCfsl7UyW4gddW2BkuIVx4W.jpg", "actors": ["Reginald Denny (Kane Halliday/Kid Roberts)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
