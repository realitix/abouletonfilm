If it's for its entertaiment value, is a 10. It's so ridiculously presented, with conspiracy music behind and the serious faces of the unbelievers. If it's for its content, is a 0.\r\n\r\nThe facts presented as an hoax are based on the ignorance of space, lunar characteristics and are presented to exploit people's ignorance of this subject. It's extremely biased towards the hoax point-of-view, and it's not a surprise, because the whole ride is about raising questions and never answering them.\r\n\r\nIt's not difficult to get the \"facts\" presented in the documentary debunked with a quick internet search. But the producers didn't want that: they wanted to sell a product and did in a fashion that lots of people like: a conspiracy."}], "recommandations_id": []}
