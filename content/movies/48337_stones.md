His first picture is the Garden of Eden. Once Eve becomes pregnant, all the tribulations of the real world are unleashed upon her. She follows through dream-like sequences populated with crying birds, brick-wall-faced bureaucrats and pensive philosophers in seemingly petrified poses. Irritated, repressed and allured by each other, the creatures on the screen start living a life of their own. Gradually, a dark climax builds up. Will the Artist himself be able to handle so much emotional intensity", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3yWFNv1DFyakuYbXzVknRKmf8vt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
