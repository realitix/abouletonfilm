But as the conversation progresses, it becomes clear that this couple, who have never seen each other face to face and who met on the Internet, have actually formed a suicide pact. Problems arise when the couple realizes that they may have finally found something worth living for. Comprised of three continuous takes-one take for each act-and shot over the course of two days, Commit is witty and disturbing, as well as an inspirational achievement in independent filmmaking.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xnTT0t8Fdfu9MJA7kaiKMiHg7DN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
