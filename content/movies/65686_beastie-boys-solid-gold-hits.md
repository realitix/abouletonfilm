In contrast to 1999's The Sounds of Science anthology, Solid Gold Hits consists only of tracks that were released as singles. Where The Sounds of Science is a double CD compilation, Solid Gold Hits contains one CD with all their singles that broke gold, plus a DVD with the respective videos of the songs. Although the standard US release of the CD/DVD has 15 songs, the Japanese release has the song and video for \"Right Right Now Now\" as the last song.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Michael Diamond (Himself / Alasondro Alegre)", "Adam Horovitz (Himself / King Ad Rock / Vic Colfari)", "Adam Yauch (Himself / MCA / Nathaniel Hornblower / Nathan Wind / Sir Stewart Wallace)", "Mario Caldato Jr. (Himself)", "Eric Correa (Himself)", "Max Perlich (Himself)", "Q-Tip (Himself)", "Chlo\u00eb Sevigny (Herself)", "Michael Simpson (Himself)", "Dave Skilkin (Himself)", "Ione Skye (Herself)", "Zoe R.
