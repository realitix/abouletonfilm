It explores the life and work of Montreal's late great sculptor and print-maker Stanley Lewis for his contribution to Canada's rich art heritage and also portrays his love for his beloved Boulevard St. Laurent, affectionately known as the Main. This cinema-verity documentary chronicles the last years of Stan's eccentric life as he struggles with his health and creative legacy. His nostalgic boulevard, his cluttered dusty studio and his vagabond friends all serve as a backdrop for the perseverance of his artistic vision and the cultural landmarks fading around him.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
