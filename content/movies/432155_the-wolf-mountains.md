The primeval howl of a wolf echoes across the mountains, followed by another and yet another wolf. Down in the valley, a wisent turns swiftly, a deer runs off a little and a beaver swims into its hiding place. Only a bear waits in anticipation of sponging off the prey of the wolf. This is the story about the rebirth of European wilderness, in which the wolf, the wisent, the bear and other rare animals live as freely as centuries ago.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g0PVjC4bTMnfICsbW4bu1fK56Ag.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
