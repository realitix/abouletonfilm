All his doubts and insecurities in collaborating with the crew and actors - especially actresses - are exposed. The biggest drama started when Bj\u00f6rk walked off the set. Nobody knew whether she would be back or not. Admitting that he feels threatened by women, who can \u2018make him feel embarrassed\u2019, the director gives this documentary the nature of a personal diary. When he discusses the importance, purpose and beauty of the use of a hundred cameras in a certain sequence or the meaning of the Dogma 95 rules, the audience is witnessing the process of the artist\u2019s search. Is the pain that the director went through during the shooting really visible in the final result, as Lars von Trier claims in this film?
