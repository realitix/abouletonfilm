He hums to himself, first lyrically, then aggressively, violently. Suddenly he wheels around to face the camera, his face filling the screen in extreme close-up, squinting at the viewer and speaking breathlessly. When finished, he turns and continues to hum, repeating this cycle again and again.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Vito Acconci (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
