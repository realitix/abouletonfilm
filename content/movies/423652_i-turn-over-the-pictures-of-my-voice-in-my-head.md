The voice is suture, the voice is seam, the voice is cut, the voice is tear, the voice is my identity, it is not body or spirit, it is not language or image, it is sign, it is a sign of the images, it is a sign of sensuality. It is a sign of symbols, it is boundary. It speaks the \u2018split body,\u2019 it is hidden in the clothing of the body, it is always somewhere else. The breath of life is its source.\" \u2013 VALIE EXPORT  \"That the vocal organs visually rhyme with female genitalia, that when they are in use, they create a fascinating flow of movement and change, makes this work a compelling new iteration by an artist who has given voice to her female body through a myriad of frames.\" \u2013 Maureen Turim", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/niUvrS4BqyB54YWidJ7bgEjAMnQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
