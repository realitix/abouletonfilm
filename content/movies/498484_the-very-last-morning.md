With a script inspired from the life of the Romanian community in Cyprus, the film tells a painful, personal story in a world in which we use only numbers to talk about emigration, prostitution and suffering, as an unfortunate statistic.  Abused by her step father, then driven away from home, Eva, a Romanian teenager, becomes a victim of human trafficking. She ends up prostituting herself in Cyprus.

Her life takes a dramatic turn when she is diagnosed with AIDS.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yViEnddpbcFsBL7CKPNXcp27JT8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
