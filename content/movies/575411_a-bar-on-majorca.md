Two obsolete apparitions: Super 8mm film stock, Kodachrome K40, exposed 30 years past its expiry date \u2013 and the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD).  A short film on the human tendency to find patterns in noise. A film on conspiracy theory, on the state of the left, and on how ideology is transported through the selection of seemingly neutral facts.  The title alludes to the NPDs former national chairman, who, since leaving the party in 2013, owns a bar in Palma.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sw7TYvvHFHVWGDzMEZeTcmwmFaS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
