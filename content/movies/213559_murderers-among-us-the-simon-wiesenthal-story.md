I watched this movie when it was first shown on television and was deeply touched by it and the story it tells. Ben Kingsley is, as always, absolutely magnificent. I have never understood why it has not (to my knowledge) been repeated or why I have been unable to find it on video or DVD. The film portrays Wiesenthals experiences in a matter-of-fact, non-sensationalised and yet sympathetic way and succeeds in giving a glimpse of the moral and ethical difficulties he faced in coming to terms with what was happening around him. The 'Sunflowers' sequence is especially poignant in this regard, as is his meeting with the mother of a dead SS man after the war. I recommend it highly. \r\n(Review by Jim Ferran)"}], "recommandations_id": []}
