Her fiancee, Grisha thinks the child may be Shura's own, and his suspicions estrange them. This leaves the way clear for a shy neighbor who has loved her from afar to gain points as a potential mate. Stenberg's design is simple and effective - a strongly-colored portrait of the pensive heroine at a table that provides space for the title and limited credits.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fWe3h3E43NT88gNvAw4f5Rr4Ng9.jpg", "actors": ["Lidiya Smirnova (Shura)", "Ivan Pereverzev (Lyosha)", "Vladimir Chobur (Grisha)", "Aleksei Matov ()", "Vladimir Shishkin ()", "Nikolai Sokolov ()", "Nikolay Trofimov ()", "N.
