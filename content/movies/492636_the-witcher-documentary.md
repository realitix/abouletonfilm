In tackling a project of this size we decided to focus down on a number of stories. The first two videos chart the rise of CD Projekt from the ashes of Soviet Poland, and include nostalgic tales of the development of the first two games.  The next three videos in the series dive into what we felt were the most uniquely interesting parts of the game's development; it's world-building, the design of it's quests and the crazy length the team go to to localize the game for other markets. Finally, the fourth video in the series is a pick & mix of many other elements that were crucial to the game's success; music, combat design, cinematics, Gwent, and much more.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wX8Th2A9g8V8BerDqWFXqKYNKo7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "hWDaiox6QqE"}
