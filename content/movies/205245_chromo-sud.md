Like the contemporaneous films by O'Leary's more famous friend Pierre Clementi, they trippily document the drug-drenched hedonism of that era's dandies. O'Leary worked with an intoxicating style that foregrounded rapid and even subliminal cutting, dense layering of superimposed images and a spontaneous notebook type shooting style. Yet even if much of O'Leary's material was initially 'diaristic,' depicting the friends, lovers, and places that he encountered in his private life, the metamorphoses it underwent during editing transformed it into a series of ambiguously fictionalized, sometimes darkly sexual fantasias. - Experimental Film Club", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1Xx7csHluKxZcN4X7ksgYkPQXPA.jpg", "actors": ["Anne-Marie ()", "Michel Auder ()", "Jean-Pierre Bouyxou ()", "Margareth Cl\u00e9menti ()", "Pierre Cl\u00e9menti ()", "Janine Delannoy ()", "Jean-Bernard D\u00e9sobeau ()", "Mich\u00e8le Giraud ()", "Jean-Jacques Lebel ()", "Rapha\u00ebl Marongiu ()", "Pierre Molinier ()", "\u00c9tienne O'Leary ()", "Lo\u00efc Picard ()", "Nicou Van Biesen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
