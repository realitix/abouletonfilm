It was Krung Srivilai's first movie. Krung was 4 years younger than Petchara so from being the younger sister (\u0e19\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07) with Mitr, Petchara becomes the older sister (\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e48)! After Mitr Chaibancha\u2019s tragic death in year 1970, the Thai cinema needed new faces, new main actors to replace the void caused by Mitr\u2019s premature death. Only a two minutes trailer is remaining as the movie is lost in Thailand. A full movie summary is still available as some old Thai movie stars magazines can still be found nowadays. Various sequences can be seen during those two late minutes : Sithao Petcharoen paddling a small boat on a river and watching young ladies, shootings. Other actors / actresses include Pisarn Akraseranee, Choomporn Theppitak, Boo Wibunnan, Wassana Chalakorn, Sopha Sataporn, Preuhat Boonlong,Sukon Koewliam. 7 songs are featured in 35mm format.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Krung Srivilai ()", "Jaran 'See Tao' Petcharoen ()", "Choomporn Theppitak ()", "Boo Wibunnan ()", "Pisarn Akraseranee ()", "Preuhat Boonlong ()", "Sukon Koewliam ()", "Petchara Chaowarat ()", "Wassana Chalakorn ()", "Sopha Sataporn ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
