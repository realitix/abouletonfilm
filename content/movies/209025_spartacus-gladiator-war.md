Based on the latest research, this dramatised documentary reveals how around 70 men armed themselves with kitchen knives and roasting spits, and chose a man called Spartacus as their leader. People came to join them in their thousands, and within a matter of months, the fugitive band was an army 100,000 strong. Strong enough to threaten the destruction of Rome. This film tells the story of a modern, dirty war of propaganda, psychological warfare and guerrilla tactics fought two thousand years ago. And it reveals the true character of Spartacus, a ruthless and charismatic leader very different to the figure created by two thousand years of myth-making.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fIfK9qBb0pH2w6GkOf7HH8ga6uO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
