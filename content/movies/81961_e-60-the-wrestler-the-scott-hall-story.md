As Razor Ramon, he was one of professional wrestling's biggest names and most villainous villains, busting chairs with the likes of Randy Savage, Bret Hart and Hulk Hogan in front of tens of thousands of screaming fans in sold-out arenas. And he loved the life that came with it: the parties, the women, the celebrity. But the high life soon started to slip away, and Hall has been desperately doing whatever he can since to hold on ever since. E:60 chronicles the heartbreaking story of a man who is a shadow of his former self and desperate for one last taste of the glory days.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1otFVqq8sJ5qQb5DlR7TeNE7gk0.jpg", "actors": ["Scott Hall ()", "Hulk Hogan ()", "Eric Bischoff ()", "Vince McMahon ()", "Stephanie McMahon ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
