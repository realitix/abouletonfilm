In the guise of a warning against wartime juvenile delinquency, the film offers the exploitational tale of a bunch of wild, unsupervised kids at large in a small community. With nothing but time on their hands, the young protagonists become involved with petty theft, inevitably leading to some pretty serious consequences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/M3q1blfqRufcdUq8Dss3BTggrm.jpg", "actors": ["Herbert Heyes (District Attorney)", "Wheeler Oakman (Jim Murray, alias Frank Wilder (edited from: Gambling with Souls and Slaves in Bondage) (archive footage))", "Johnny Duncan (Dan Murray)", "Fred Towns (Eddie Quinten)", "Sylvia Stanton (Rose Gordon)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
