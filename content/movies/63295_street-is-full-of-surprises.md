However, the guard Vasili Shaneshkin mistakenly delivers to the police station a non-escaped offender, but quite a decent cashier. To all other things, Vodnev, offended by the police, turns out to be the father of the bride of Shanishkin's Katya. Vasily admits his guilt, but, not daring to explain himself, leaves an angry Ivan Zakharovich with bad thoughts about the Soviet militia. Fortunately, the young sergeant will soon have the opportunity to prove to others the responsibility and integrity of the militia.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5L8GWMw657syK8dOB6KSmVgcEYW.jpg", "actors": ["Leonid Kharitonov (Police sergeant Shaneshkin)", "Dzhemma Osmolovskaya (Katya)", "Georgi Chernovolenko (Vodnev)", "Vsevolod Larionov (Vladimir Zvantsev)", "Yakov Rodos (Smirnov-Aliansky)", "Evgeni Leonov (Policeman Serdyukov)", "Pavel Pervushin (robber)", "Lev Stepanov (drunken hooligan)", "Vladimir Vasiliev ()", "Aleksandr Melnikov ()", "Nikolay Gavrilov ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
