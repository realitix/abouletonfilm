In Our Darkest Moments mixes wry humor and tense drama as it chronicles the sleazy exploits of a hunky, closeted married man who cruises seedy bookstores and sex dens. He begins an affair with a dangerous teenager, unaware of the disastrous effects it will have on his life. In the Dark, Softly, directed by Joe Rubin, is a love story (of sorts), chronicling a young man's obsession with a local serial killer. And in the final film, In Deep, the police are trying to catch a murderer who preys on lonely men and then offs them with his extraordinarily large appendage. Maybe this killer is more than he seems.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f0AIIBoOfSK9MSYUqzsfm2lXyMd.jpg", "actors": ["Anthony Blaze (Park Victim (segment \"Deep\"))", "Rachel Cable (The Girl (segment \"In The Dark Softly\"))", "Johnny Carvajal (Kevin (segment \"In our Darkest Moments\"))", "Brian Chankin (Nasty Queen (segment \"In The Dark Softly\") / Street Pick Up (segment \"In the Dark Softly\"))", "Kostja Darvi (Bouncer (segment \"In our Darkest Moments\"))", "Ryan di Noor (Cop (segment \"Deep\"))", "Nick Eskow (Alley Victim (segment \"In The Dark Softly\"))", "Frank Failing (Bum (segment \"In our Darkest Moments\"))", "Daniel Fox (The Boy (segment \"In The Dark Softly\"))", "\u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda (Designer / Victim (segment \"Deep\"))", "Brandi Harnish (Nancy - Reporter (segment \"Deep\"))", "Kl Kenzie (Gwen (segment \"In our Darkest Moments\"))", "Andrew Mcardle (Customer (segment \"In Our Darkest Moments\") / The Man (segment \"In the Dark Softly\"))", "Blake Melvin (Gallery Salesman (segment \"In our Darkest Moments\"))", "Rick Morrisey (Gallery Owner (segment \"In our Darkest Moments\"))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "bYM18F75iqk"}
