Peter is a responsible professional, who's excited to get his first proper account as copy-writer in a small Belgian publicity firm- for condoms, a product the conservative boss dreads as slightly obscene. Tom however is a dare-all without much sense of decency, who earns his living as process-server and repo-man for a judicial bailiff. In their free time they're nearly inseparable, Tom cheering up his somewhat gloomy realistic friend and urging him to take silly risks during a weekend at the seaside and even cheat on his steady girlfriend. When the graphics department refuses to execute Peters idea for the condom campaign without a live male model, only Tom is pleasantly mad enough to pose stark-naked.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7C4vMJc3z0fk8CaJwtSun5ILGxg.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Pas (Peter)", "Tom van Bauwel (Tom)", "Francesca Vanthielen (Dana)", "Hilde Heijnen (Tanya)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
