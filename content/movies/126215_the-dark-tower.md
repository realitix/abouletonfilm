As this shape of tower disappears, the conflagration of scratches and paints seems grounded and takes on the semblance of a battle of knights, their lances, horses, et al, often against a scattering of star-like flecks until finally the silhouette of the tower reappears as if much closer, certainly thicker and straight-sided. The film finishes as textures which tend to suggest an entrance into the textured walls of the tower, textures and stars intermingled with what may well seem chain-mail as well.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x03f5ZRe563wy43rGGTFoJzEE7c.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [97517, 105717, 126213, 126189], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
