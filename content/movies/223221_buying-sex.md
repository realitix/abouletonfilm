Buying Sex captures the complexity of the issue by listening to the frequently conflicting voices of sex workers, policy-makers, lawyers and even the male buyers who make their claim for why prostitution is good for society. Examining the realities in Sweden and New Zealand, and respecting the differences of ideology as Canada works its way toward an uneasy consensus, the film challenges us to think for ourselves and offers a gripping and invaluable account of just what is at stake for all of us.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vZfFGCD472RcTDasiFJyJaOsP0U.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "CQbWV5rDrTk"}
