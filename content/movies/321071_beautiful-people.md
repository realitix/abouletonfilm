The film follows his 3 Teens Kill 4 bandmate, Jesse Hultberg, as he makes himself up in drag and ventures out onto the streets of New York and then beyond the city limits to a quiet lakeside. The nostalgic, accepting tones of the film honours this dual identity- Wojnarowicz saw \u201cdrag queens as true revolutionaries who fuck with visual codes of gender.\u201d Here, the artist is using a symbol of dual identity to observe, discuss and redefine gender definitions and expectations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9axsD6vOaxfutMzSCNRky5qnIka.jpg", "actors": ["Jesse Hultberg ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
