As well, Roy Ward Baker is one of the most underrated directors of the period--his entry in The Criterion Collection, 'A Night to Remember', is easily the best telling of the 'Titanic' tragedy. Thus simply on the basis of those three alone, I heartily recommend the film to any adventurous cinephiles of this era."}, {"pseudo": "Cat Ellington", "content": "Nell Forbes was by far the darkest and most volatile character Marilyn Monroe had ever portrayed in her entire career.\r\n\r\nWritten by Daniel Taradash and directed by Roy Ward Baker, Don't Bother To Knock - a chilling and uncommonly masterful film noir thriller - gives its viewers an up-close glimpse into the crevices of a deeply disturbed human soul.\r\n\r\nNeed a babysitter ... anyone?\r\n\r\nYet another five star oeuvre, Don't Bother To Knock is an effort of prodigious degree in classic cinema."}], "recommandations_id": [43856, 30948, 380592, 99453]}
