One that is seen by the eyes or the one that is proved in the court. Whatever may be the truth but court admits only what is proved and that's why it often gives a wrong judgement. Sadhana is an educated woman of today who cannot tolerate injustice done to any woman, and her husband Santosh Kumar is a very honest police officer who will sacrifice anything for law and duty. One day Sadhana's sister is killed and the killer is her husband Suraj Prakash who can even sell his wife for money. The matter goes to court. Fabricated proofs win and truth is defeated.
