Laurie Anderson's tone is less outraged than elegiac, mourning for lives lost, ideals misplaced. The music is dramatically stripped down to a handful of players, centered around Anderson's haunting violin and voice, frequent Bill Frisell band-mate Eyvind Kang's viola and Peter Scherer's keyboards.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eztZKHWpkRWqdknUqho8hQYQOzE.jpg", "actors": ["Laurie Anderson ()", "Bill Frisell ()", "Pat Dillett ()", "Keiran Hebden ()", "Lou Reed ()", "Antony Hegarty ()", "Peter Scherer ()", "Eyvind Kang ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
