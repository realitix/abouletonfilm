Because they simply love the taste of lamb, baked \"robber-style\" in a hole dug under a campfire, they forge their car's number plates and other important documents just to be able to poach sheep grazing on the roadside without getting caught. Lots of man talk around the campfire, aided by lots of booze. The summer may be wet, but the vodka is definitely dry.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n0QumHGyGL3uAyDNeGQhpAHqICS.jpg", "actors": ["Heikki Kinnunen (Sepe)", "Leo Lastum\u00e4ki (Valtteri)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
