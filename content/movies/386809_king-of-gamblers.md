Perhaps I was not impressed by the film because of a black and white image. There was a moment when the protagonist gave his <a href=\"http://www.cbjpodcast.com/\">zodiac casino review</a>  and this comment really interested me. When I started looking for information about what was shown in the film, I was very disappointed. Certainly, I do not say that the movie is not worth watching. That would be wrong, because it is just one thought and I am not criticizing the movie, which saw hundreds of movies. I still think the movie is worth watching. However, you should not expect much from him."}], "recommandations_id": []}
