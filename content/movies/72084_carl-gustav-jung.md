Part of that interview was filmed in 16mm. After reviewing the images obtained, the footage was censored in many countries, ending up in oblivion, lost in a warehouse in Central America. Just 50 years later, after several years of searching for images around the world and a difficult reconstruction and restoration, the director Shang Solomon offers us on the big screen almost all of the interview with Jung, known as the main opponent to the theories of Freud and an eminence of the Philosophy and the History of Psychology.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/imP5bPqvhTz8YE0pFQ2vzTAnXQX.jpg", "actors": ["Carl Jung (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "6ZP4Doxz1-g"}
