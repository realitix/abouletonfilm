She steals change from the dumpling restaurant she works at part time. Her father\u2019s settlement costs and custody costs aside, she cannot even pay her overdue rent. She must look for a place to sleep. She goes to see her one-time roommate and college friend Yeojin, who suffered depression and had attempted suicide many times. Somehow, a happy Yeojin does not ring quite right with Min-gyeong, but having found a place to stay, she is relieved. Her stay does not last long, though. Having to find another place to stay, she gets help from a man with whom she had sex for money. His son Seonghun hopes that Min-gyeong becomes his mom, and Min-gyeong slowly begins to feel attached to him. February is a story about a woman who keeps making bad choices. Her crimes are not big, but morally condemnable, and she keeps running away from a chance at a fresh start. True, her surroundings are no help to that fresh start either.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j7wmg5NmqNq2wsnSzA2monqXM31.jpg", "actors": ["Minkyoung Jo (Minkyoung)", "Sunglyoung Kim ()", "Youngbin Park ()", "Siwan Park ()", "Juwon Lee ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
