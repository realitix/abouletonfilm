As a result of an erroneously installed wind turbine, the flicker effect, which brings to mind structuralist experimental cinema, appears instead in documentary images showing the landscape and architecture of a Massachusetts coast town.  The film focuses on the visual quality of the pulsating shadows that intrude the suburban domestic sphere and disrupt the social and psychological equilibrium of the community.  Documentary images are complemented with a female voiceover, which is based on multiple interviews that were transcripted and assembled into a single narration. The film slowly uncovers fragmentary memories from the time when the flicker began. An atmosphere of suspense and intangible fear is generated throughout the film, while the actual source of the flickering lights remains unknown.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ggOAug8bqcL96TUeyOoAvOXsb70.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
