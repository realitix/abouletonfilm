The stars of this musical movement reveal to us how to reuse old video games hardware like Nintendo\u2019s GameBoy, NES, Atari ST, Amiga and the Commodore 64 to turn them into a tool capable of creating a new sound, a modern tempo and an innovative musical style. This is a new way of interpreting music performed by a great many artists who show their skills in turning these \u201climited\u201d machines designed for leisure in the 80\u2019s into surprising musical instruments and graphical tools. It will leave nobody indifferent.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7nmBKBFp3IkP9WKdLI4mHfCJSxO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [393561], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
