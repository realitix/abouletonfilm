{"tmdb_id": 282442, "title": "Marinetti", "original_title": "Marinetti", "slug_title": "marinetti", "date": "1969-06-19", "genre": [""], "score": "7.5/10", "synopsis": "Albie Thoms' Marinetti was the culmination of the synthetic environments that the UBU group had pioneered in Australia; festive public 'happenings' that combined the energy and volume of creative rock and jazz with the mesmeric effect of multi-dimensional lightshows.  Another kind of culmination: Marinetti records most of the principal collaborators in the UBU film group, like Aggy Read and the Perrys. Uniquely valuable as a document of Australia's late 1960s counter-culture, the soundtrack provides the best indication of the unrestrained liberty that bands like Tully and the John Sangster Underground band some of whose members perform on this recording were famously achieving in their improvisations of the period.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tOgq4Yfri2sLXKsHdKdpxKpxCCN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
