On the one hand, this is due to the dubious character of the subject, the man-eating femme fatale, which Berg had taken from Frank Wedekind's two Lulu tragedies \u2013 \"The Earth Spirit\" and \"Pandora's Box\" \u2013 and combined into one opera libretto. On the other hand, Berg's window had (for personal reasons) repeatedly refused to have the opera completed, which was unfinished when Berg died. This video is of the unfinished two-act torso of \"Lulu.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/keq3b1LvwwV9WnMcfY5nNow40Bt.jpg", "actors": ["Laura Aikin (Lulu)", "Cornelia Kallisch (Countess Geschwitz)", "Peter Keller (Medical Specialist)", "Steve Davislim (Painter)", "Alfred Muff (Dr. Sch\u00f6n)", "Peter Straka (Alwa)", "Guido G\u00f6tzen (Schigolch)", "Andrea B\u00f6nig (Schoolboy)", "Katharina Peetz (Dresser)", "Rolf Haunstein (Animal Trainer/Acrobat)", "Martin Zysset (Prince/Manservant)", "Werner Gr\u00f6schel (Theatre Director)", "Lynn Lange (Child)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
