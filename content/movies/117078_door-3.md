She tries every trick in the book, including aggressive flirting, which gets her plenty of gropers but no buyers. One day while venturing down a narrow stairwell, she injures her ankle and happens upon Mitsuru who works for some mysterious foreign company. Decked out in high goth style -- complete with long inky black hair and mascaraed eyes -- Mitsuru cuts quite an odd figure, yet his seductive though menacing ways make him difficult for Miyako to resist. Escorting her to his office to treat her ankle, Miyako notices that his all-female staff seem more glassy-eyed and soul-deadened than the average office workers. In fact, they seem almost like zombies. Later, weird things start happening. Mitsuko finds vomit on her doorstep, she seems to be tailed by a shadowy woman in a red dress, and most strikingly, she finds herself utterly powerless against Mitsuru's advances.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m9W6ZgGpvaRqZqb6qY3W5GzEH5S.jpg", "actors": ["Ren Osugi ()", "Taro Suwa ()", "Ryo Amamiya ()", "Hatsunori Hasegawa ()", "Toshihiko Yamamoto ()", "Kazuhiko Nakamura ()", "Manz\u00f4 Shinra ()", "Shintar\u00f4 Takado ()", "Minako Tanaka ()", "Rinko Mayumi ()", "Yoshiko Yura ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
