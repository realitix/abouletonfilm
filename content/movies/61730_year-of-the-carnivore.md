SAMMY SMALLS is a 21-year-old tomboy who works as a store detective at Big Apple Food Town. Her job is to deliver shoplifters to her boss who beats them up so they never re-offend. Sammy is head over heels for scruffy street musician EUGENE ZASLAVSKY. He's perfect for her, funny, irreverent and sensitive, but the problem is, he doesn't want to be in a relationship. After a disastrous one-night stand that goes beyond the boundaries of their friendship, Eugene suggests they play the field to get more experience. Following his advice, Sammy hatches a plan catapulting her on a quest that takes her through her neighbours' bedroom, the public swimming pool, and finally to blackmailing shoplifters into giving her sex lessons in the woods behind the supermarket.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p6jZFdZpKzJoNGxHOwGmj3lrLsQ.jpg", "actors": ["Cristin Milioti (Sammy Smalls)", "Mark Rendall (Eugene Zaslavsky)", "Ali Liebert (Sylvia)", "Kevin McDonald (Mr. Smalls)", "Sheila McCarthy (Mrs. Smalls)", "Will Sasso (Dirk)", "Emily Holmes (Kathy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [24908], "youtube_key": "TqXWAsXMgME"}
