Hasse) fought in the Spanish Civil War (1936-39), but now he is an old man, readying himself for death. His daily life is filled with memories, reveries, feelings, and small but meaningful encounters; these are the stuff the film is made up of. Some of the musings are of a hallucinatory nature, as when he meets with a tramp during imaginary walks. Others are more ordinary, as when he interacts with his son's family or enjoys looking at the pretty women in the building across the street.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xzhlBH96okzo829UgVsOUJjYdWG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
