Andrea Dunbar wrote honestly and unflinchingly about her upbringing on the notorious Buttershaw Estate in Bradford and was described as \u2018a genius straight from the slums.\u2019 When she died tragically at the age of 29 in 1990, Lorraine was just ten years old.  The Arbor revisits the Buttershaw Estate where Dunbar grew up, thirty years on from her original play, telling the powerful true story of the playwright and her daughter Lorraine.  Also aged 29, Lorraine had become ostracised from her mother\u2019s family and was in prison undergoing rehab. Re-introduced to her mother\u2019s plays and letters, the film follows Lorraine\u2019s personal journey as she reflects on her own life and begins to understand the struggles her mother faced.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9PEARWTlJk8LLj7tjCszFeozS0I.jpg", "actors": ["Christine Bottomley (Lisa Thompson)", "Manjinder Virk (Lorraine Dunbar)", "Natalie Gavin (The Girl)", "George Costigan (Jimmy 'The Wig')", "Monica Dolan (Ann Hamilton)", "Neil Dudgeon (Steve Saul)", "Jimi Mistry (Yousaf)", "Robert Emms (Young David)", "Kate Rutter (The Mother)", "Danny Webb (Max Stafford-Clark / The Father)", "Matthew McNulty (Andrew Dunbar)", "Kathryn Pogson (Pamela Dunbar)", "Jonathan Jaynes (David Dunbar)", "Lizzie Roper (Kathy Dunbar)", "Liam Price (Billy)", "Robert Haythorne (Fred)", "Parvani Lingiah (Young Lorraine Dunbar)", "Gary Whitaker (Himself)", "Jamie Timlin (Himself)", "Kulvinder Ghir (Rafee)", "Moey Hassan (Bus Conductor)", "Josh Brown (Policeman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [409133, 188395, 409134, 306490], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
