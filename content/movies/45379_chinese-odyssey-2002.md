He's caught and returned to his angry mother by the royal guards, but the Princess, disguised as a man, manages to escape. Meanwhile, King Bully (Tony Leung) has returned to his hometown, where he is widely despised for his bullying ways, to run a restaurant with his tomboy sister, Phoenix (Vicki Zhao). They have a very close relationship. In fact, King Bully mistakenly believes that he can read his sister's mind. When the Princess arrives in town, King Bully finds himself drawn to her, but, believing she's a man, decides that his attraction is some kind of empathy with Phoenix.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jZdT63XWtBBCmPIzLyJd1YATdxn.jpg", "actors": ["Tony Leung Chiu-Wai (Li Yilong)", "Zhao Wei (Phoenix)", "Faye Wong (Princess Wushuang)", "Chang Chen (Emperor Zheng De)", "Athena Chu (Amour Amour)", "Ning Jing ()", "Rebecca Pan ()", "Eric Kot ()", "Roy Cheung ()", "Peter Chan Lung (Horse Thief)", "Jeffrey Lau ()", "Wong Wing-Ming ()", "Wang Wang ()", "Zhong Han-Hao (Old eunuch)", "Siu Tsik-Yuet ()", "Wang Xu-Dong ()", "Yu Xin ()"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "ColinJ", "content": "A thoroughly charming combination of romantic comedy and a parody of the films of producer Wong Kar Wai.\r\n\r\nFaye Wong is just luminous and Tony Leung Chiu Wai shows he has significant comedic chops."}], "recommandations_id": [81128, 51484, 169479, 45442], "youtube_key": "eFsVTbeF1fI"}
