Without sound and handpainted. A dance of colors, forms and flaws at a speed that seems to mock the lyrical effect of the result. Laconically entitled SB, the film is part of a series of handpainted movies that Brakhage has repeatedly chosen as specific material for processing. It is a silent, colorful piece of pure rhythm. In the din of grand, extravagant cinema, this small cinematic haiku is a special gift from the great filmmaker Stan Brakhage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q5lhRtOd4OyrFFfkwwDkoxLAOvQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [216531, 142657, 208084, 208947], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
