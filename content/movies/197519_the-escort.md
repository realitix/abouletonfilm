Until Steve showed up to strip as a birthday present, the life of lovers Jean-Marc and Phillipe had settled into a comfortable but passionless rut. Jean-Marc is alone at the time and has sex with Steve. Later that night, Steve tries to change a light bulb and falls, causing his friends to jump to the conclusion that he tried to kill himself. Soon Phillipe too gets involved with Steve. Finding Steve a tonic to his doldrums, Phillipe begins pursuing a real relationship with him. Steve then proves to be a troubled character who is involved secretly with another man who has been diagnosed with HIV. The problem stems from the fact that the mystery lover is none other than Phillipe's dearest friend. Matters are complicated by Nathalie -- who secretly loves Phillipe -- and by his recently divorced mother.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gtXd82GI9ca0TEZf2PE4RjUHvZa.jpg", "actors": ["Paul-Antoine Taillefer (Philippe)", "Eric Cabana (Jean-Marc)", "Robin Aubert (Steve)", "Patrice Coquereau (Christian)", "Jasmin Roy (Joe)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
