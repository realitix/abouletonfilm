The team's investigation leads them from one bizarre and frightening clue to another, at the center of which seems to exist something evil and terrifying, a presence well beyond their wildest imaginations and experiences. Before long, they realize this deadly entity has now targeted each of them, and they are confronted with the impossible challenge of defeating it and saving their own lives. In the end, what survives, and is presented here, is the disturbing footage that Patrick and his team shot, footage that if seen by others, likely endangers the viewer, marking them as the next victim of this powerful and evil force. Be careful what you chase - you just might end up catching it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v6qgtlJ4D7BhXTCoH6lb1LHj7Vc.jpg", "actors": ["Challen Cates ()", "Chris Devlin ()", "Vivan Dugr\u00e9 ()", "Elise Eberle ()", "David Goldman ()", "Ary Katz ()", "Cory Knauf ()", "Tim Phillipps ()", "Stephan Smith Collins ()", "Chris Yule ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [44493, 280552, 73986, 259668], "youtube_key": "YVy9xQBFJvM"}
