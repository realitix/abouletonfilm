We follow the caravan as it is taking a salt-selling journey on the Ancient Trade Route between Tibet and China. The memory of the ancient trade route was regarded as something that had fallen into oblivion untiol we met the last salt caravan in the deep mountains of Tibet. The Province of Yunnan, located in the south western part of China, is the very starting point of the Ancient Tea Trade Route toward Tibet, which was also called a southern Silk Road with a two thousand year history. Caravans from Yanijing and Yunnan still take this route to trade tea grains and most importantly, salt. Throughout the history, slat had been the source of power and taation. This region and the salt caravan have never been introduced to the outside world and therefore, their local charactestics and culture are untouched by modern civilization.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
