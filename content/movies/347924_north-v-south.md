Like the Cold War, territories were respected out of the necessity to avoid apocalypse, with each side keeping tabs on the other\u2019s capability. Such a precarious false harmony could not last forever. Now someone has crossed the line, and there\u2019s no going back. An illicit love affair smolders, breaking taboo and threatening catastrophe at the smallest mistake. It is a romance of purest, unadulterated love, yet so forbidden that its discovery would wreak total carnage. The story is told through vignettes of strikingly original characters, with intertwining subplots that echo the complexity of life in the dog-eat-dog criminal underworld.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lRr4CHMvDKyXmQVZcQROUTLfCoQ.jpg", "actors": ["Elliott Tittensor (Terry Singer)", "Bernard Hill (John Claridge)", "Freema Agyeman (Penny)", "Brad Moore (Gary Little)", "Steven Berkoff (Vic Clarke)", "Charlotte Hope (Willow Clarke)", "Geoff Bell (Bill Vincent)", "Keith Allen (Tony Lefevre)", "Oliver Cotton (Brian Galloway)", "Gary Cargill (Danny)", "Greta Scacchi (Mrs Singer)", "Steve Evets (Alf)", "Sydney Wade (Sam)", "Dom Monot (Gustave)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
