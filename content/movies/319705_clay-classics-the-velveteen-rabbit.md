This story has been adapted in animation using Will Vinton style claymation. It is entertaining and enjoyable for the whole family.  It is definitely a throwback style of claymation to the 80's & 90's, especially if you're familiar with the California Raisins.  It enhances the story and makes it very pleasant to watch."}], "recommandations_id": []}
