Although the velveteen rabbit is the favorite plaything of a young boy, the more modern, mechanical toys hold the stuffed bunny in contempt \u2026 except the rabbit's single friend, the skin horse, who has become real. As the horse explains the mystery of how to become real, a fable about the transforming power of love and imagination unfolds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7DjDpVEQgBYl21lZaeFPNBfwwwA.jpg", "actors": ["Michelle Scott (Velveteen Rabbit)", "Ronald France (Skin Horse)", "Daniel J Kennelly (Boy)", "Brenda Wehle (Nana)", "Alison Fraser (Nursery Fairy)", "Henry Strozier (Doctor)", "Dennis Blair (Wild Rabbit)", "Jennifer Shapiro (Narrator)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "Doramius", "content": "The Velveteen Rabbit is a classic tale loved by children and adults, alike.  This story has been adapted in animation using Will Vinton style claymation. It is entertaining and enjoyable for the whole family.  It is definitely a throwback style of claymation to the 80's & 90's, especially if you're familiar with the California Raisins.  It enhances the story and makes it very pleasant to watch."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
