Bernard Eisenschitz, who was involved with Luce Vigo (daughter of Jean Vigo) in the 1990 reconstruction of this masterwork, takes us into the raw materials by which this complex film was re-envisioned and continues to be analyzed and changed today. An important vision of film as a tradition of viewership, curation and exploration.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bokuISbefWfBizQwSOEzTcbgVCC.jpg", "actors": ["Bernard Eisenschitz (Narration)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
