Fran\u00e7ois de Roubaix's electronic music accompanies these images, photographed under a polarizing microscope. Some liquids obey the laws of crystallization; we observe those transformations. Sometimes objects flowing, other times they change as if in a kaleidoscope. Colors give way to sepia, then back to multiple colors. The crystals can look like tiny organisms: small four-part fans share the frame with flowing lines of pink. Multiple patterns appear side by side.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kaMVoAIz7L0scyD4OpDC1rVAXvt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [117592, 147015, 147211, 233180], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
