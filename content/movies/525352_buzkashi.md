Azam plays as an individual for honor and integrity, but his success is increasingly thwarted by organized alliances, or \"mafias\", encouraged by his rival Khurshed, a member of Tajikistan's nouveau riche. Khurshed believes that team play is the future of the sport. Between challenges on the field and within his own family, Azam tries to find a place for himself in the new Tajikistan.
