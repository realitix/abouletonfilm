As the interrelated stories proceed, the connections between the lives of the five characters begin to reveal themselves and their stories unravel. By depicting five different characters at emotional crossroads, Do Over examines the struggle of overcoming our greatest fears; the unknown of what lies ahead in the future, the fading value of our existence in the present, and most of all, irreversible mistakes made in the past that may catch up to us.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uXMBIsJtpqwencoEcKErvHcIKEP.jpg", "actors": ["Mo Zi Yi (Li Xiang)", "Josephine Xu (Fi Fi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
