This is how one of the core works in Mushroom's oeuvre emerged, a film of rarely concise elegance about the craft of ayurvedic healing in hyperconcrete and light-flooded pictures, intensively penetrating in the colors, precisely in every glance that seems to have clapped open hands. One has the happy feeling that mushroom would have felt better in those days. ImplicitIndian Diary - Days at Sree Sankara also pays homage to Robert Gardner and his Great Song on the Burning Forks of Benares, Forest of Bliss (1986), whom Fungus loves so fervently as if it were a piece of him - he likes to tell that sometimes when watching the film, he thinks he has shot this or that scene.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
