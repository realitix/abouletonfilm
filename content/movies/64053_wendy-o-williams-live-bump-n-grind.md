Williams emerged as one of the most notorious figures on the American punk scene; dubbed the queen of shock rock, her on-stage theatrics were the stuff of underground legend. Often clad in little more than strips of electrical tape covering her nipples, the raspy-voiced Williams earned a cult following for her on-stage antics, which included blowing up cars, sawing guitars in half, and setting equipment on fire. Wendy O Williams name and legacy live on amongst her many fans and Bump n Grind will be a must see for all of them. The DVD features a full live show from her October 1985 UK tour.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xRbeqFq6H40FQkn0n1NyU6OXySe.jpg", "actors": ["Wendy O.
