The husband acquiesces in his wife's having a lover who visits her every Friday. The lover participates in a collective living arrangement, where sex as well as household chores are shared. Thinking that they will benefit from a similar scheme, the couple starts their own collective. However, the wife dislikes it when her husband begins to spend time with a younger woman in the collective, and the collective frowns on her having an outside relationship (her Friday lover).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yDTShaEbrXCpGG6tMTK3am847Tw.jpg", "actors": ["Pia Gr\u00f8nning (Maria)", "Bill \u00d6hrstr\u00f6m (Sten)", "Claus Nissen (George)", "Ellen Holm (Wife)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
