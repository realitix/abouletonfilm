It embraces the dead, and with them their memories. Digging for these memories can reveal another life. Not as a document, but as fertile ground for feelings and thoughts. Director Levin Peter spends a lot of time in intense conversations with his grandfather who used to be stationed in the Ukraine as a soldier of the Wehrmacht. Levin travels there, looking to trace and excavate what he has heard. What he has heard are the kind of tales that can haunt you in old age.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j3KCeuh2EQd0fk39VWnBzxGZ0df.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "MzOWusaLWVA"}
