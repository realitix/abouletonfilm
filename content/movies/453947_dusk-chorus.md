A sound artist, \u201cfield recorder\u201d, and eco-acoustic composer, he understands terrain through sound. For the sound landscape of this region is as rich as the diversity of wildlife that produces it. Today, global warming and humans are threatening species, and sound pollution itself is involved in the extinction of some of these; nature being well constructed, the sound spectrum of the forest is based on a subtle balance, in which each species communicates on a very specific frequency, never interfering with the others. The upheaval caused by man, through the installation of a pipeline for example, upsets this balance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rZafROfo8GxTpdv0i5cgeuW2X7K.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "-L6rId7OLB8"}
