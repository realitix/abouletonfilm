But what where do they come from? And what ensures they keep coming? How do you sort the genius ideas from the useless ones? Why invest all this hope and energy into making things in the first place? From Nothing, Something profiles creative thinkers across a variety of disciplines and finds common methods, habits, mindsets and neuroses that help bring breakthrough ideas into being. This is a thoughtful, intimate, often funny look at the creative process\u2014straight from the brains of some of our culture's most accomplished and inspiring talents.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uLtRZEdL1BdKNnzfdZddepIwOOi.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Perrotta ()", "Maria Bamford ()", "Neville Page ()", "Sara Quin ()", "Mary Sue Milliken ()", "Susan Feniger ()", "Keith Young ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "UAcbVnp_pbo"}
