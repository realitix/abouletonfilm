Formed in the Bronx with the intent of infusing Dominican bachata with the sounds of contemporary American R&B, Aventura released their first album in 1999, and built their following steadily but surely over subsequent releases. This 2007 two-disc live release, which finds the group playing to a sold-out crowd, is an enjoyable sampler of their smooth, tropical flavor (Aventura fall more on the traditional side than the hybrid or R&B side) and charismatic performances.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iZ2oE41f7ispy0Nbc7yJDC5WK81.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
