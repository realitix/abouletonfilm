As the three women negotiate the dangerous relationships among them, the seven women directors weave a sensual tale of suspense. Drawing inspiration from the poem by Jessica Wilbur and the surrealist parlour game, The Exquisite Corpse, each director selected a word or phrase on which to base her segment, and the seven chapters of the film bear their individual marks. This impressive experiment in filmmaking emerges as a sensitive tale of young desire, loss, and love's confusion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a1ZHjRV75he294i7ZUtX9aSGsZ.jpg", "actors": ["Autumn Brooke Wilkins (Girl)", "Candace Thompson (Melissa)", "F.
