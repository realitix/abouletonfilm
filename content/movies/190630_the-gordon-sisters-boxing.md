Shows two female pugilists who are really clever. They engage in a hot one-round sparring bout. A park, with marble entrance and walk, and beautiful trees and shrubbery, make a very pleasing background. The exhibition is very lively from start to finish; the blows fall thick and fast, and some very clever pugilistic generalship is shown.
