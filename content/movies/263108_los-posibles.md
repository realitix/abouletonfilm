Although it would have been more accurate to say \u201chis first film-story-adventure-movie-great movie following The Student\u201d, the word movement fits perfectly in Los posibles, the most overwhelmingly kinetic work Argentine cinema has delivered in many, many years. The film deals with the adaptation of a dance show directed by Onofri together with a group of teenagers who came to Casa La Salle, a center of social integration located in Gonz\u00e1lez Cat\u00e1n, trying to find some refuge from hardship. Already entitled Los posibles, the piece opened in the La Plata Tacec and was later staged in the AB Hall of the San Mart\u00edn Cultural Center. Now, it dazzles audiences out of a film screen, with extraordinary muscles and a huge heart: Los posibles is a rhapsody of roughen bodies and torn emotions. Precise and exciting, it\u2019s our own delayed, necessary, and incandescent West Side Story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vrnrBTX2ZctywE904nM82JO3h7A.jpg", "actors": ["Alejandro Alvarenga ()", "Alfonso Bar\u00f3n ()", "Daniel Leguizam\u00f3n ()", "Jonathan Carrasco ()", "Jonathan Da Rosa ()", "Lucas Araujo ()", "Pablo Kun Castro ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
