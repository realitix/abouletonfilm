At the time of its release, there was much controversy in the documentary-filmmaking world over the fact that the Aussies signed over exclusive distribution rights to a French firm, resulting in a boycott from other movie companies. None of this matters when the film is seen today: though not in the same league as Leni Reifenstahl's Olympiad, this 110-minute extravaganza is consistently entertaining. Fifteen cameras were utilized to lens every aspect of the event; it was then up to editors Jean Dudrumet and Monique Lacombe to burrow through miles and miles of film to cull the highlights seen herein. Portions of Rendez-Vous a Melbourne have since resurfaced in practically every Olympics documentary -- not to mention the many TV specials attending the now-biannual event.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k10xyYx4aiPt1tAzfYPk1De3bmw.jpg", "actors": ["Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier (Narrator)", "Raymond Marcillac (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
