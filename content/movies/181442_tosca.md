The star singers in this revival of the 2006 production were Angela Gheorghiu, Jonas Kaufmann and Bryn Terfel; the Royal Opera Chorus and the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House were under the baton of Antonio Pappano, the Music Director of the Royal Opera House.  The pageantry of church ritual, the darkness of a brooding study with its hidden torture chamber and the false optimism of the light of a Roman dawn - all throw into relief the love of the beautiful diva Tosca, the idealism of her lover Cavaradossi and the deadly, destructive obsession of the malevolent Chief of Police, Scarpia. Drama, passion and fabulous music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1vHrt5S1LLFjNtY1R7wcy0ZjLgV.jpg", "actors": ["Angela Gheorghiu (Floria Tosca)", "Jonas Kaufmann (Mario Cavaradossi)", "Bryn Terfel (Baron Scarpia)", "Lukas Jakobski (Cesare Angelotti)", "Jeremy White (Sacristan)", "Hubert Francis (Spoletta - A police agent)", "Zhengzhong Zhou (Sciarrone - A police officer)", "William Payne (Shepherd Boy)", "John Morrissey (Gaoler)", "Antonio Pappano (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
