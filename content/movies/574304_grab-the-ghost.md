The wedding limo pulls off leaving the groom (Snub Pollard) behind, who then has to chase it down the street.  He catches it up but is made to sit on the back of the car \"as ballast\".  The car comes to a halt where the groom mistakes a policeman's gesturing of traffic as an offer of a handshake. Finally, the groom arrives at his house where his servant greets him, but unbeknownst to him, the servant's child (Ernest Morrison) has set up a scare in the shape of an \"angora\" bird in a cage under the dinner table before they get there.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["'Snub' Pollard (Husband)", "Marie Mosquini (Wife)", "Sunshine Sammy Morrison (Servant's Child)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
