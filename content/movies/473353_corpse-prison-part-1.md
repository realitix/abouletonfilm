Can it really be true that, for 50 years, not a single girl has been born in this isolated community?  Despite the fact that Mayor Amano and the other all male residents have enthusiastically welcomed her and the other three coeds attending Professor Ashihara\u2019s overnight seminar, Mikoto can\u2019t shake the sense of increasing dread that consumes her. Something horrible has happened here. Something that is about to happen again. Because the town has been waiting for her. And the other girls.
