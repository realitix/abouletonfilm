The film tells about the quest, doubts, extremes and experiences of a young man who chose a difficult path of abstinence not only from many worldly goods, but also from all thoughts that contradict his own picture of the world, based on religious dogmas. On his way, he encounters, it would seem, everyday and ordinary questions for a modern person, nevertheless, which do not fit his world outlook. Leaving efforts to resist to all that in his opinion \"it is impossible, not arbitrary,\" he tries to get used to, to accept, to reach a balance with the world in which he lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ioVUwoOHT7uRpKwfpgQQ4davdob.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
