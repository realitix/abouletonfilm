Alone and secluded away in his town house in Funston County, he lacks the inspiration to write his next story when a stranger named Dr. Spencer calls him, claiming the research lab he works for has formulated a drug with seriously dangerous side effects. Skeptical and suspicious as to why Dr. Spencer wants him to cover his story, Walter is motivated to write again. But while Walter writes, unexplained occurrences of events begin to happen around him. Walter gets harassing phone calls, stalked and taunted.
