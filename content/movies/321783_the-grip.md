He whiles away his days in a chair in the house of his son and daughter-in-law. He has to see how his adulterous daughter-in-law plots to murder her two foster children and her husband. Jean-Marie can't intervene and because he can't talk he can't warn his own family. Misfortune, tragic developments, and a fatal ending dominated many of the early Dutch fiction films.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/97CECMNC8RHG4AWvuZy9JWpSu8r.jpg", "actors": ["Louis Bouwmeester (Jean-Marie Hardouin)", "Ko van Sprinkhuijsen (his son Hippolyte)", "Mien de la Mar (Rose)", "Rafa\u00ebl Bouwmeester (Emile)", "Frits Bouwmeester (Etienne)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
