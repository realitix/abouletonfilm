Only two rival tribes live on the island doing mostly fishing. War brings terror on the quiet island. From then on the tribe who wins the \"friendship\" of the Nazis can dominate also over the other tribe. The film would be much better without politicization (Soviet censorship) and seems therefore at times unrealistic.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
