Finding Heaven Under Our Feet: Making Modern Dance, a feature-length documentary film, is a journey through time. Choreographer and dance historian, Dr. Jody Weber describes the roots of modern dance in the expressive dance movement of 19th century Boston, illustrating the art form's ties to the early 20th century women's rights movement. Seeing herself as an heir to these early innovators, Weber works with her Somerville-based dance company to address the elusive nature of the genre through community engagement, audience education and the ability of artists to use their work to tackle social and cultural issues, such as climate change and our relationship with the planet.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pOlzOzjteI9Ml8sST961VjBtBua.jpg", "actors": ["Jody Weber (herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
