For Weiss, the plague means the \u00abextinction of everything that makes life miserable and low and freedom along with it. Unbeknownst to him, he has won the support of a patron who is of the exact opposite opinion: for Johannes Wagner, the plague is an organising principle, and, aided by his agent Moosbrugger, he is able to smuggle a new number onto the programme. Whereas Ottocaro Weiss means to represent the plague theatrically, what appears on stage is the scientific reality of the rat-borne infestation.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Fran\u00e7ois Simon ()", "Paul Gogel ()", "Norbert Schwientek ()", "Janine Weill ()", "Gothard Dietrich ()", "Gerhard Dorfer ()", "Peter Kner ()", "Wolfgang Rottsieper ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
