Indeed it has twenty percent of a world market, second only to the United States. And this industry is considered so important by the government that it consumes almost half of all research and development funds. Strangely it produces not consumer goods that people want, but machines that hardly any of us use or want to use. Moreover, for all its\u2019 preeminence, its\u2019 future is uncertain and depends to a large degree on secret deals with some of the most corrupt and brutal regimes on Earth. One of the biggest manufacturing industries in Britain at the close of the century is ARMS. John Pilger and David Munro look behind the political rhetoric and discover the world of international arms dealing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mmZ4yA7gK1FsxctRTefAdpYGjM2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
