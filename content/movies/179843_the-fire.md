A stranger, with whom she briefly dances, offers to walk her home. Next morning, upon returning home, Judith refuses at first to accept that she\u2019s a rape victim, but in the end decides to go to a doctor and press charges - which prove inadequate to have the rapist convicted. Under the influence of sweeping bodily and mainly psychological oscillations, Judith decides she has to follow an unorthodox path in order to prove the perpetrator\u2019s guilt.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9KRhcw1BcfMy8LWOQU9s21ngr0y.jpg", "actors": ["Maja Sch\u00f6ne (Judith)", "Mark Waschke (Georg)", "Wotan Wilke M\u00f6hring (Ralph Nester)", "Florian David Fitz (Valentin Stein)", "Ursina Lardi (Anne Nester)", "Pit Bukowski (Jugendlicher)", "Joachim Nimtz (Arzt)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
