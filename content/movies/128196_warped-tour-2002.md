The long-running Warped Tour (nine years as of this DVD production) is an annual mosaic of state-of-the-art punk rock, a road show featuring 17 or so acts in various stages of artistic development.  Shot in summer 2002, Live features the barefoot, chummy excitement of piano-centered Something Corporate, some first-rate (even vaguely melodic) thrashing on Anti-Flag's \"Got the Numbers,\" galloping folk-punk from Ireland's Flogging Molly, and Reel Big Fish's crisp ska with a Coasters-like sense of humor. The tour's handful of veteran acts--Mighty Mighty Bosstones, NOFX, and Bad Religion among Them--are the tent poles of Vans' moveable feast, and they don't let the rain-soaked crowd down. Breathtaking extras include a visit to the tour's biker-mad Moto-X Park and the half-pipe at the pro BMX skate park.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1bHyD61gAC52Xrm2YccbMIRf5tm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
