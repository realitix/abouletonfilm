A shot of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris develops into a women's foot scene which leads to a longer kiss scene punctuated by an explosion, falling leaves, a tank, touching hands, a hand in a plaster cast, bunches of grass and a dark cellar door. After observation of a skeleton detail, the found footage actors become involved in slowly feeling each others body. A man swings a necklace back and forth like a pendulum, a head being bandaged, attempts at face make-up, details of operations... in a flickering, pumping screen light until, in the end, \"Hey Joe\" centres the picture briefly with his penis. After the hand movements which follow, the veiled face of a woman appears again, longer this time, to be observed by \"Hey Joe\" until the film floodlight is turned off.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xixZNF52jymC1PWKq3p5UgK5IVY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
