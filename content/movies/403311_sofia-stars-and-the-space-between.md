Infrared imaging of stars and planets is difficult from ground-based observatories because water vapor in Earth's lower atmosphere blocks most infrared radiation. SOFIA operates from a modified Boeing 747, soaring above this vapor to capture infrared emissions from distant galaxies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rPLuzG8dCMlvxANrRKvBFp72gBS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
