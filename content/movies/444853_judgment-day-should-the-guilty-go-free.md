This documentary focuses on three inmates in Louisiana, Nevada, and Massachusetts with a range of chilling crimes - a father's murder by his troubled son, a crime of passion by a respected NASA scientist, and a shooting/robbery on the streets of Las Vegas. Incorporating interviews of key characters with extensive testimony footage and reenactment sequences that explore the life and crime of the inmate, the film vividly examines the conflicting needs of the victim, the criminal, and the community while testing our own notions of justice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/959NsFehwBY35nLIMpF2DMP0hGv.jpg", "actors": ["Ronnie Stutes (Himself)", "J.D.
