The legendary and incomparable partnership of Mirella Freni and Luciano Pavarotti as the two lovers has been captured in this special live recording from stage of the San Francisco Opera. Brian Large has adapted Francesca Zambello's production for video, further illuminating the fascinating interaction of Puccini's characters.  Gino Quilico sings Marcello, the colorful and moody painter, whose tempestuous relationship with the flirtatious Musetta (sung by Sandra Pacetti), comically mirrors the more profound love of Rodolfo and Mimi. Nicolai Ghiaurov sings Colline.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j8zSqlxYBtwo21iJRaUGknGkl4w.jpg", "actors": ["Tiziano Severini (Conductor)", "Mirella Freni (Mim\u00ec)", "Luciano Pavarotti (Rodolfo)", "Gino Quilico (Marcello)", "Nicolai Ghiaurov (Colline)", "Stephen Dickson ()", "Italo Tajo ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
