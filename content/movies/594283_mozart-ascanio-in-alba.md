It's amazing how the singers could focus on their arias and keep their composure.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ApD2VCwUqSrULgIOTIgABE46spT.jpg", "actors": ["Diana Damrau (Fauno)", "Sonia Prina (Ascanio)", "Iris Kupke (Venere)", "Marie-Belle Sandis (Sylvia)", "Charles Reid (Aceste)", "Adam Fischer (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
