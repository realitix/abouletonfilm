Alan, with his portrait of the Queen and love of the peerage; his wife April, who raises cats; youthful and pretentious friends Nigel, Giles, and Anthony, who gather for a wine-soaked dinner party with the chatty and risque Samantha and the mousy Caroline; the plummy Lord and Lady Crouchurst, in a spot of bother needing the help of Francis, a senior partner, to assist with the family's cash flow. Alan comes home from work to find Mr. Shakespeare doing a photo shoot of one of April's cats and a wealthy stranger, Miss Hunt, waiting to purchase one. His instincts for sycophantic palaver kick in.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nKZbS14CFhknUuwWEB2BJr6OrT6.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Kane (Alan)", "Joolia Cappleman (April)", "Phil Davis (Kevin)", "Simon Chandler (Nigel)", "Felicity Dean (Caroline)", "Adam Norton (Giles)", "Graham Seed (Anthony)", "Catherine Hall (Samantha)", "Geraldine James (Miss Hunt)", "Sam Kelly (Mr Desmond Shakespeare)", "Jeffrey Wickham (Francis)", "Souad Faress (Samya)", "David Neville (Lord Crouchurst)", "Richenda Carey (Lady Crouchurst)", "Lavinia Bertram (Nanny)", "Francesca Martin (Selina)", "Angela Curran (Woman in Window)", "Roger Hammond (Man in Window)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
