Yet despite his failing health and the seeming impossibility of the task, Hawking is still devoted to his work; an extraordinary drive that's captured here in fleeting interview snippets and footage of the scientist sharing a microwave dinner with some fawning PhD students. Though the pop-science tutorials that dapple the first of this two-part biography are winningly perky, Hawking, alas, remains as tricky to fathom as his boggling quantum whatnots", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cFTo4sQVtYliokr1ZIxtxrNYDiP.jpg", "actors": ["Stephen Hawking (Himself)", "Roger Penrose (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
