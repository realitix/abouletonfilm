The plot thickens when Rosa's backstage life begins to mirror the travails of the character she is portraying. The climax comes when Harry Peters (Fosco Giachetti), the American father of Rosa's illegitimate child, returns after four years with his new wife in tow, leading inexorably to a doleful ending both on- and offstage. Critics complained about the substandard photography in Il Sogno di Butterfly, but this might have been due to poor laboratory work.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eSs3oOiqWgBIOACUetfKG9nzFCU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
