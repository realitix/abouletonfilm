It has a touching side to it. Of course, I felt so happy seeing Robert Downey Jr. just being his plain hot self. He looks good when he's clean and he looks good when he's dirty.  And then there's Zach Galifianakis. I loved him in Hangover. He's super funny there. But I was surprised to watch him in this movie because not only is he in his funny self, he did a couple of crying scenes which were touching. \r\n\r\nThis movie is tiring. YES. Tiring. All the adventures and misadventures that they had made me really tired. My rate for this movie is B+. I can never give Robert a low rating hehehe."}, {"pseudo": "stackkorora", "content": "A generic road trip movie with two terrible people who continuously make bad choices in a predictable plot rife with even more predictable \"gags\". Galifianakis portrays an even dumber and less funny version of the Hangover while Downey plays a less intelligent and less humorous version of Tony Stark.\r\n\r\nSeriously, it isn't worth your time. If you want a funny road trip film then go watch 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles' instead. Doesn't matter if you've seen it before. You will still feel a lot happier than if you had wasted your life on this film."}], "recommandations_id": [51540, 7446, 45243, 693], "youtube_key": "ABeKWdKCbu8"}
