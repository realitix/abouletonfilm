Led by Willy DeVille, whose unique  style and inimitable gravelly voice always made them stand out from the crowd, Mink DeVille released their first album in 1977 and immediately had a huge hit with the track Spanish Stroll. By the time of this appearance at Montreux in 1982 they were touring in support of the fourth album Coup De Grace and the show features tracks from across their career to that point as well as a couple of unreleased gems including their cover of the Ben E. King classic Stand By Me.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dvtHF542KMWuXXIjEyKCZVbgVLu.jpg", "actors": ["Willy DeVille (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
