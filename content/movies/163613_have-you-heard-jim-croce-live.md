In a two-year span, he had eight Top 40 singles, two of which were #1 records and a #1 album. Despite being one of America\u2019s most-loved artists, there has never been a video document of his career. Until now.  Have You Heard: Jim Croce Live, features the late singer-songwriter\u2019s performances on television in the early 1970\u2019s. Set in an intimate style akin to today\u2019s popular Unplugged series, the DVD includes performances of such classic Croce songs as \"You Don\u2019t Mess Around With Jim,\" \"Operator (That\u2019s Not The Way It Feels),\" \"Bad, Bad LeRoy Brown,\" many not seen since they were originally broadcast.  Jim Croce\u2019s widow, Ingrid, and their son A.J., provide special narration, filled with intimate anecdotes and stirring memories of their lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cCfLpy7hLloeHBNJfGBtjxwPEER.jpg", "actors": ["Jim Croce ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
