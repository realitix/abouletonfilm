The result is a film that asks the viewer to bear witness and honor the complexities of our trans elders, and to walk away empowered to live a similar life of richness, intrigue, and intimacy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h1YzSihzdY7OjZ5qtpWFSsXihb3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
