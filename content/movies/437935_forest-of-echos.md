Looking for them she finds the bodies of three drowned kids on the shore of a lagoon. On summer holiday, deep in the woods, three kids, cousins, are playing around a lake when they find a drowned young woman drifting in the water. Games, lies and rituals unfolding into a circular time in which death loses its ultimacy. What is real and what is a mirage? Who is dreaming and who is being dreamed?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kjj5EPVWUTo7UvixxvxJuYUMHvv.jpg", "actors": ["Calista Berger (Calista)", "Christina Kasper (Christina)", "Katharina Plaim (Katharina)", "Florian Lang (Boyfriend)", "Kathrin Resetarits (Mother)", "Jasmin Wallner (Jasmin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
