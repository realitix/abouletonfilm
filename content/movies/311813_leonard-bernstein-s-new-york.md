Filmed in the Big Apple locales celebrated in his immortal music -- including Times Square and Central Park -- this 1997 documentary commemorates Bernstein and his legacy. Among the featured performers are Mandy Patinkin and Audra McDonald.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8tsQYQeESnXtYuy5ajmM8aPiA2d.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
