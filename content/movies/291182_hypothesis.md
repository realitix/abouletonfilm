He proposed based on his observations, that the only way for the towers to fall the way they did was the use of explosives in a controlled demolition. His theory conflicts with official reports which concluded the towers fell from impact damage and fires caused by the hijacked planes. This created a firestorm within the community and even reached nation media attention. Steven Jones received hate mail, threats, and even bribery to stop his research. What started as a mere Hypothesis became so much more.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uW4HT4GD0VB9FeAOkVS0W9SfLrk.jpg", "actors": ["Steven E.
