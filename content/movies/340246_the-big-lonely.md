Director David Manougian unveils the captivating, intimate and redemptive story of Michael Nelms and his dog Tic, who, after becoming homeless, chose a life in a remote wilderness hideout over 'living under a bridge.' Micheal's stunning self-shot account is at once gritty and heartwarming, sorrowful yet awe-inspiring as we eavesdrop on a man surviving in a self-built cabin dealing with the physical and mental hardships of such a life. 'The Big Lonely' is a far too common American Story, told in an uncommonly personal full-length documentary.  -", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/76rjuKacNJZbBwbSxgkyZ9Garyr.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Nelms (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
