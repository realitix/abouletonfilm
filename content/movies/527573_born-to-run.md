Instead of making him a partner in their classic car business, his father Burke has demanded he work harder. His mistress Judith could arrive to gate crash the celebrations at any moment and to top things off midway through the line 'I'm going to live forever' from his karaoke Fame rendition, Burke keels over with a heart attack. Amidst this chaos, Burke's wife Lili sees a chance to make her escape and ducks out of the party to leave for an impromptu holiday in Tenerife. When she returns, she is a changed woman and intent on taking up marathon running. With Burke critically ill and Lili off guard, the rest of the family squabble for control of the business.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9fvj69uplUnt8obHVZKYSaC9YnT.jpg", "actors": ["Billie Whitelaw (Lili Flitch)", "Keith Allen (Byron Flitch)", "Terence Rigby (Burke Flitch)", "Marian McLoughlin (Bron Flitch)", "Linda Henry (Judith)", "Crissy Rock (Edna)", "Mary Jo Randle (Theresa)", "John McArdle (Eddie Gallagher)", "Rachel Davies (Elayne Quigley)", "Kieran O'Brien (Ryan Flitch)", "William Ash (Sammy Flitch)", "Kaye Wragg (Nimmy)", "Alison Lomas (Tiffany De Lysle)", "Ray Emmet Brown (Skag)", "Gary Beadle (Muff Muffin)", "Gary Jones (Daniel Flitch)", "Sam Kelly (Raymond)", "Joe Melia (Albert)", "Saskia Downes (Suzie)", "Margo Stanley (Betty)", "Anna Welsh (Myra)", "Danielle Mason (Natalie)", "Sarah Kirkman (Nurse Fido)", "Ingrid Wells (Petra Melchett)", "Arturo Venegas (Alfredo Marquitos)", "Peter Kay (Removal Man)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
