Respected wherever he fishes, Bob has the ability to read any water at speed, and choosing the right bait is something he does instinctively, and in this film, he will demonstrate how he uses maggot and caster to great effect.  With maggots being ideal for tempting so many species to the bank, they are always a popular choice.  Bob will show how to present this bait, as well as explaining the use of casters in conjunction with maggots.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/azpfWKmqXN1hwWK20lR2MdLjUOk.jpg", "actors": ["Bob Nudd MBE ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
