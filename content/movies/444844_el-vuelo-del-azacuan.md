During their migration they pass a point in the mountains of Huehuetenango, Guatemala. This region is inhabited by the Maya population Q'anjob'al, a mythical culture full of ancestral stories and beliefs and that practices the chibal, the art of hunting birds that are used for food when there are shortages of wheat and maize crops. In this documentary, birds and human beings demonstrate the greatness of the search for prolonging life. A drama that shows the darkest and shiniest facets of humanity, against the fragility and nobility of nature, which is open to life and exposed to the risks of sharing the same spaces with those who can have an effect on their destiny.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/85gq4a0Jf9SuLvSQbveHuw6FjYG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
