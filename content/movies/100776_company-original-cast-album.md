D.A. Pennebaker, the now-legendary documentarian, filmed the production of the original cast recording, the back and forth between Sondheim and the performers, and the dynamic of trying to record live performance. The film climaxes with Elaine Stritch's performance of \"The Ladies Who Lunch\". The show won 6 Tony Awards including \"Best Musical\" and ran for two years on Broadway.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ropG8u3VlmmYv8NKd6OMiql6jy6.jpg", "actors": ["Stephen Sondheim (Stephen Sondheim)", "Hal Prince (Hal Prince)", "Elaine Stritch (Elaine Stritch / Joanne)", "Dean Jones (Dean Jones / Robert)", "Pamela Myers (Pamela Myers / Marta)", "Beth Howland (Beth Howland / Amy)", "Barbara Barrie (Barbara Barrie / Sarah)", "Charles Braswell (Charles Braswell / Larry)", "Susan Browning (Susan Browning / April)", "George Coe (George Coe / David)", "John Cunningham (John Cunningham / Peter)", "Steve Elmore (Steve Elmore / Paul)", "George Furth (George Furth)", "Harold Hastings (Harold Hastings)", "Charles Kimbrough (Charles Kimbrough / Harry)", "Merle Louise (Merle Louise / Susan)", "Donna McKechnie (Donna McKechnie / Kathy)", "Teri Ralston (Teri Ralston)", "Thomas Z.
