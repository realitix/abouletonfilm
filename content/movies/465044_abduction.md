Melissa rescues a young woman from a mental hospital where no-one believes she is a victim of abduction by aliens. She and a colleague try to prevent the aliens from taking her but a government agent seems to be hot on her trail, and the Alien Greys and their powerful leader, The Hive Queen have no intention of being stopped.
