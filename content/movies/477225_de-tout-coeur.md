Safaa Fathy put together three of these original lectures in a film for the FIDMarseille festival. \u201cDe tout c\u0153ur \u201d speaks of life and death, the Other and friendship. Derrida was unable to accept the invitation to attend the Writers \u2019Parliament in Strasbourg, so he sent an \u201copen letter to Palestine \u201d. Facing the camera,he reads a collage of texts, excerpts from books and correspondence. The second fragment shows the statement on cloning made by Derrida, unique in his career, presented at the Kl\u00e9ber bookstore in Strasbourg. Lastly ,on the occasion of a conversation filmed in a Paris University, Jacques Derrida and Jean-Luc Nancy deconstruct together and in public the imagination of the heart. These are three records of living words, three exercises in thinking on sight.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jacques Derrida ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
