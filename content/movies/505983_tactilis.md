An immobile ferryboat. The characters are lonely passengers unconsciously seeking the feeling of belonging. Through what seems to be a moment of accidental physical contact, a new language starts to form between them. The film replaces words with gestures and it navigates around the structure of a relationship. The minimum amount of contact that takes place, becomes an alphabet. All the fragments of their encounter get mentally amplified by each one of them and end up forming a game.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
