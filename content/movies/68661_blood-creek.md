Local legend states that if you perform a specific ritual in the barn and the old house up the road, you'll see visions of Zeke Ashbrooke, a farmer who went mad and hung himself, his wife and children. Rumour has it that Zeke's wife - now known as The Dark Lady - still roams the woods of Blood Creek. This summer five young campers will venture to Blood Creek and accept a dare that could cost them their lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b43BmGHZsdSb5XLChnpSnshFm39.jpg", "actors": ["David Dineen-Porter (James)", "Ryan Tonkin (Kyle)", "Angelica Montesano (Lara)", "Ashley Morris (Sheryl)", "Perry Mucci (Dickie)", "Scott Cameron (Eric)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
