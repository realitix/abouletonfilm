You\u2019ll become that annoying person that sits your friends down to watch it, only to irritatingly nudge them in the ribs again and again whispering \u201cthis is a funny bit\u201d.  Danny Bhoy, Live at Festival Theatre is the Scottish-recently-turned-Australian citizen\u2019s fourth DVD, and like its predecessors is full of hearty laughs and some very quotable lines.  The performance shot in his \u201chometown\u201d Edinburgh covers a range of topics from Scottish soccer, to sexting, gay Vikings and an encounter with Matt Damon.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aFSCuib3fe8Rfn6od1HoxtFXikQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
