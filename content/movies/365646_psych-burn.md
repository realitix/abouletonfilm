ABC had given us some coin to make a few short films for a TV Pilot. \u201cLove-In Tonite\u201d was to be a psychedelic rock variety show with live performances, skits, and whatnot to cash in on the emerging hippie demographic. Even pre-Disney, the network was riddled with a bunch of out-of-touch, pencil-pushing buffoons, so I quickly realized the show would be a disaster. Imagine if \u201cMidnight Special\u201d was produced by Aaron Spelling. Then cast Charles Nelson Reilly as emcee. That would have been a far more lively show than \u201cLove-In Tonite\u201d. So I decided to deliver the suits a farewell kick-in-the-butt called \u2018Psych-Burn\u2019. The best part was that they presented my film sight unseen at a board meeting about the new Fall Season. I heard some heads rolled over that one.\u201d \u2014JXW", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iGPeoKTTrrHqfDzDObryY3SD6Pw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
