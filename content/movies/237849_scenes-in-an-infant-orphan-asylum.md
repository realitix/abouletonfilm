The beginning portion includes the dining facilities for the children. A woman dresses as a nurse leads approximately two hundred small children into the eating area where they stand behind their chairs. At a given signal, each child sits down and begins eating. The remainder of the film is devoted to showing some of the infants, less than a year old, being pushed in baby carriages and bathed, and later having haircuts. All of the children wear similar attire and the nurses wear uniforms.
