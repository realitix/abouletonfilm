Ambi arrives in Kumbakonam from Delhi to see his ailing father, Vembu Iyer (Sivakumar). His father, an orthodox religious scholar, revered for his knowledge in vedic studies, is now ill, having only his memories to accompany him. Before his marriage to Janaki, Vembu Iyer intensely loved Avayam, much to the anger and diapproval of Vembu's own mother, who hated her daughter-in-law as she loved to dance. Eventually, Avayam and Vembu separated because of the pressure. Beginning to understand that guilt might be a reason why his father has retreated into silence over his own marriage, Ambi suggests bringing his stepmother Avayam to the house. Janaki, a traditional, submissive woman by nature is upset by the proposition, becoming frustrated at the prospect of sharing her husband with another woman. Eventually, Ambi's friend Murthy helps to reach a solution.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fLEO2NYLlaJ7OeMcMdf8Lyg7xWK.jpg", "actors": ["Sivakumar (Vembu Iyer)", "Jayabharathi (Janaki)", "Radha (Avayam)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
