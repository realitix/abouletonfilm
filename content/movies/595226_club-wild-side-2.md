Tina is an aspiring actress who looks for work in the movies by day, but by night she's the main attraction at Club Wild Side, a high-spirited \"gentlemen's club\" in Hollywood. Joe has also come to Los Angeles to break into show business. He gets a job at the club, and eventually becomes a performer himself because of a certain part of his physique, where nature was very generous. A sexual obsession sparks between Tina and Joe.
