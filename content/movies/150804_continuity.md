According to the press materials, and to several people I spoke to about the film, this is the story of a family seeking to reconstruct their lost son\u2019s return by hiring a series of male prostitutes. Certainly this implication is there: incest thrums throughout, like a threat; the father exploring the younger man\u2019s mouth with his fingers, the mother climbing into his bed. But it seems to me that Continuity is more obviously involved with Fast\u2019s enduring themes of repetition, trauma and the fraught ways in which conflict becomes news, fiction or documentary.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
