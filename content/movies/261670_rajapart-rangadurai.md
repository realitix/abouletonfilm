It is a film on theatre artists who in time have been ignored, they play all roles from mythology characters to patriotic people but fail to appeal a modern genre of viewers who part their ways to more glamour and glitter. It is a symbolic film of past being rejected by the present and love and affection have no place in a selfish world. Sivaji Ganesan's one of the most outstanding film roles, where he displays his characters like Bhagat Singh, Joker, Tiruppur kumaran and even lord Murugan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t8crHkRhH4WMdg9YHRuOSmnx6wh.jpg", "actors": ["Sivaji Ganesan ()", "Usha Nandhini ()", "M.
