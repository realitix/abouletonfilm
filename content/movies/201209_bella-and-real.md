All of the players want to play center. Olle's right hand man is Sammi, father of a Kurd family with a son on the team. His daughter Bella has the impossible dream of becoming the goaltender. All of the men in Real are opposed to women on the soccer field. The Kurd culture demands that the patriarch of the family keeps the female in order or he loses face.
