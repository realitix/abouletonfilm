In a flash he is whisked away by two approaching medical attendants to the nearby hospital to heal a patient with holes throughout his body. The doctor sees no hope and lets the man die. As he walks back towards his car, a talking gargoyle admonishes the old doctor and tells him he'd be better off committing suicide. In his car, the doctor's heart begins to give way. As he approaches death, the saint of emptiness appears to show the old man a new way of seeing life", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t4epwQiEMIeWQ17s1kExSfuzxCe.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [257719, 128700, 127824], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
