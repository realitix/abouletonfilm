Returning to his native Liverpool, Martin pulls together a backing band of misfits and loners, and recruits his ex-girlfriend Joan (Lisa Stansfield) as a singer. Things are complicated somewhat by the fact that Joan is now married to the policeman who arrested Martin, and when the band's first gig - at a heavy metal pub - goes badly, it seems as though the road to musical success may be a rocky one.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8ha9KUgPqpHRTMYgeYiyiuqz7ft.jpg", "actors": ["Hugo Speer (Martin Luxford)", "Lisa Stansfield (Joan Woodcock)", "Paul Usher (Liam Luxford)", "Rita Tushingham (Mags Luxford)", "Tom Bell (Sid Luxford)", "Alexei Sayle (Mighty Mac)", "Tom Georgeson (Uncle Matty)", "Scot Williams (Buddy)", "Danny McCall (Andy)", "Clarence Clemons (Jack)", "James Hicks (Oi)", "Nerys Hughes (Maria)", "Del Henney (Colin Wooton)", "Jon Huyton (Terry Storey)", "Dermot Keaney (Arnold)", "Eddie Webber (Cockney Wanker)", "Gavin Watson (Orangeman Pianist)", "Carl Chase (Heavy Metal Landlord)", "Chris Walker (Prison Warder)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
