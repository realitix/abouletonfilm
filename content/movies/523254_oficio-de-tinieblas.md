The landowners are against any reform and are also not interested in ending the exploitation of their workers. On the opposite side of the fence, the Native Americans have almost no way to better their living conditions or to fight oppression. They are also plagued by \"superstition,\" which leads to some misguided actions that only make things worse. Violence and sexual encounters are interspersed throughout the story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vRiFN3e6iAH30DRIbOFhOMAfp2k.jpg", "actors": ["Enrique Lizalde (Leonardo)", "Julissa (Julia)", "Manuel Ojeda (Fernando)", "Lilia Prado (Mercedes)", "M\u00f3nica Miguel (Catalina)", "Ana De Sade (Marcela)", "Jos\u00e9 Carlos Ruiz ()", "Lupita Lara ()", "Malena Doria ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
