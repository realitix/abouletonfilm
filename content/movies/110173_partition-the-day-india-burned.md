The story is told through the testimony of people who lived together for centuries, but were forced out of their homes as one of the largest and most ethnically diverse nations in the world was divided. Dramatised reconstructions evoke some of the mistrust, violence and upheaval that ensued", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fUS9N7tRY9uxssTFoMxlykchR7Q.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
