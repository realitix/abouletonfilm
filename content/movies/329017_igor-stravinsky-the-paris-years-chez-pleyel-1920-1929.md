This is the first section, which covers the pianist\u2019s \u201cFrench period\u201d from roughly 1920-1939, and it details, among other things, his connection with Jean Cocteau (who, as a matter of fact, contributes voice work to this project). Filtered through gonzo and impressionistic puppetry (often bearing strong resemblance to the work of Terry Gilliam), the film takes an unconventional and often beautiful stab at the television biography special.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5GFvuOwH6Ka7pn2QEpHoAzUYevR.jpg", "actors": ["Alexei Jawdokimov (Igor Federovich Stravinsky)", "Milos Kirek (Vladimir Mayakovski)", "Jan Rosol (Jean Cocteau)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "EPMIZmEaTiY"}
