Welcome to South Portland, Maine explores a demographic shift through the lives of young women attending high school in what is considered the whitest state in America - Maine. The film's 14 teen protagonists-from Somalia, the Congo, Vietnam, Jamaica, and southern Maine-are enrolled in a hip hop, health and culture program during the most anti-immigrant period in recent U.S. history. The 2016 presidential race and recent terrorist attacks have fueled an atmosphere of mistrust, fear, and violence against recent immigrants.
