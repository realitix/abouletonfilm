Every frame of this video is a raw still from a Canon 5D2 DSLR and processed with Adobe software. In Volume 2 I again show off my beautiful home state of Arizona and I also made several trips to Utah. This video has some iconic landmarks that we have seen before. I felt that showing them again with motion controlled HDR and/or night timelapse would be a new way to see old landmarks.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qu0Z0xRBC8rpGHTNhtahF4q9tGc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
