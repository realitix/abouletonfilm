Journeyman actor Eddie Dew stars as Revere, a Texas Ranger who goes undercover to smash an outlaw gang. Meanwhile, the villains install an informer amongst the Rangers, meaning that Revere will have to take care of this guy before he can complete his assignment. While Eddie Dew was OK in the lead, his thunder was stolen by the young actor cast as \"Trigger Dolan\"-future superstar Robert Mitchum. The plot was a bit too complicated for a film of this nature, thus future John Paul Revere installments were a bit easier to follow.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uB2yYaqoNcYbCUZJyhN2xwaq3oW.jpg", "actors": ["Eddie Dew (Johnny Revere)", "Smiley Burnette (Frog Millhouse)", "Lorraine Miller (Susan Cook)", "Robert Mitchum (Trigger Dolan (as Bob Mitchum))", "Harry Woods (Big Bill Hadley)", "Ernie Adams ('Sarge' Kincaid)", "Richard Clarke (Steve Kincaid)", "Charles Miller (Major Cook)", "Kermit Maynard (Henchman Clyde Barton)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
