It was good...the ending was somewhat anticlimactic, but the bulk of the film was solid, aided by a terrific performance from Otto Jespersen as a grizzled old troll hunter who works for the government and has been growing increasingly frustrated with their secrecy. The special effects also were incredible (here in 2012, when special effects have progressed so far, for me to mention the special effects in a truly film marks them as something special). A few storytelling quirks (mainly subplots that didn\u2019t mean much or go anywhere) held it back a bit for me, but overall: very good, and worth the watch."}, {"pseudo": "Andres Gomez", "content": "Interesting and decent movie getting the most of what it has at hand for a probably quite low budget."}], "recommandations_id": [43933, 14451, 52015, 1255], "youtube_key": "vy2nAOdBUlw"}
