Combining archive and contemporary footage - including that of the royal visit to Canada and the US in 1976, the bicentenary year of American independence - the film explores the monarchy through a quarter-century which saw the conquest of Everest, the development of television as a mass medium, the first supersonic flight and space exploration.  Through good times and bad, and tumultuous changes for better or for worse, one factor remained constant: the monarchy, in the person of Queen Elizabeth II, provided a continuity and stability which this film celebrates in her Silver Jubilee year.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fDfZoVIIb0G9rvn5RV95JmZKc83.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
