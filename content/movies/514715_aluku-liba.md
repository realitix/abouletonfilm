One night, due to a crackdown on illegal gold mining, Loeti is forced to flee the site where he is working. Lost in the Amazon forest, he must use what is left of his childhood knowledge of the forest, to find his way back and combat the many deadly perils that lurk with every step. He is guided by the spirits, the animals, a compass, and his prayers.  An intense reunion confronts Loeti with a changing world where old traditions and values are both challenged and influenced by the invading modern world.  Loeti must deal with his past and grapple with what remains of the Aluku's ancient African customs by immersing himself in their magical world.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Loeti Mais (Loeti)", "Laurence Alota (Captain Laurence)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "vixGRLhK3mU"}
