Camacho, a light-hitting southpaw who at 34 and as a former lightweight was also considered past his prime, had a record of 62\u20133\u20131. Leonard decided to fight Camacho after commentating on his fight with the 45 year old Roberto Duran the previous year, in which Camacho had won a disputed decision which Leonard had called \"an early Christmas gift\".  Leonard blamed his poor performance against Norris to lack of motivation, a rib injury, moving down in weight, and divorce, which was being litigated while he was in training. \"It was stupid for me to fight Norris at 154 lbs,\" Leonard said. \"This is different. I'm in the best shape possible", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9Dx7wEog4BFvFDjqDFjdqcKZoLW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
