The diary records the daily events in the lives of a London clerk, Charles Pooter, his wife Carrie, his son Lupin, and numerous friends and acquaintances, over a period of 15 months. The hapless Victorian diarist records the minutiae of life in the suburbs with a dry wit, sarcasm and mostly misunderstood humour, as he battles with impertinent tradesmen, exasperating friends and his wayward son Lupin's various misdemeanours.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yiwNg2YiiIzJGE7jH7CdEM6qxkK.jpg", "actors": ["Hugh Bonneville (Pooter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
