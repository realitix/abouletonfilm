Lenny is a 14-year old boy who is totally fascinated by sex. He is too scared to \"do it,\" so he dedicates his summer to seeing two other people do it. Easier said than done. Caught in the act of spying, his mother and stepfather ship him off to spend the summer with his aunt and uncle in \"the country\" -- Queens.
