After seeing them at work and several creative ways of tuning a piano (such as removing the offending key and cutting the key itself to a shorter length), the two attend an opera singers performance. The singer passes out when the piano plays a wrong note, and Tom and Jerry are pressed into service to re-tune the piano. After pulling the offending key from the keyboard like a bad tooth, the two give the opera audience a jazz piano performance, with the now recovered opera singer joining in.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9BlkBcMczLZsLOdSSn8IIDfHqyn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
