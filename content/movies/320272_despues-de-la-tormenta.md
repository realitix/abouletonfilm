The principal characters are a pair of twin lighthouse keepers. They try their best to live together with their wives under the same roof, but the delicate balance is shattered when one of the brothers falls in love with his sister-in-law. When one twin is lost during a storm, the other assumes his identity, with the expected romantic complications. If Despues de la Termenta sounds familiar, it is because the screenplay was inspired by the 1946 Bette Davis vehicle A Stolen Life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3lgQ379kjQbY3LoCEZimZxcE5Mi.jpg", "actors": ["Marga L\u00f3pez (Rosa Rivero)", "Ram\u00f3n Gay ()", "Lilia Prado ()", "Jos\u00e9 Luis Jim\u00e9nez ()", "Salvador God\u00ednez ()", "Ignacio Solorzano ()", "Pepe Romay ()", "\u00d3scar Jaimes ()", "Salvador Terroba ()", "Augusto Benedico ()", "Prudencia Grifell ()", "Celia Manzano ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
