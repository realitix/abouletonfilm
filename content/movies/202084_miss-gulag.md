Miss GULAG explores the individual destinies of three women: Yulia, Tatiana, and Natasha, all bound together by long prison sentences and circumstances that have made them the vigilantes of their own destinies. For these women, undoubtedly, life is harsh under the constant surveillance of UF-91/9, but it is no less so on the outside. Today they, their families, and loved ones are sustained by hope for a better life upon release. This is a story of survival told from both sides of the fence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z5fMGYdq3e6g9q1vH8HLSwolnKt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
