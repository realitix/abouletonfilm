In their school days, Chun-sam was always the ambitious class president, while Dae-gyu had to settle for a role as vice president. Twenty years later their roles are reversed: Chun-sam is now a humble farmer who has assumed the post of village chief in his hometown, while Dae-gyu is the newly elected county magistrate. At first, Chun-sam asks his old friend for favours regarding the development of his village, but these requests are turned down. Later, when Dae-gyu proposes building a nuclear waste disposal facility in the county, Chun-sam leads demonstrations against the plan, turning old friends into bitter rivals.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dwzba1fKU0SUt03JM3vDM7u9EtO.jpg", "actors": ["Yoo Hae-jin (Noh Dae-gyu)", "Cha Seung-won (Cho Chun-sam)", "Byun Hee-bong ()", "Choi Jung-won (Nam-ok)", "Kim Bo-ra (Hyang-soon (young))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
