A story of a Jewish girl forced to hide her identity in order to attend medical school in St. Petersburg, the movie is a melodrama of multiple oppression. Lea, as played by Negri, is at a disadvantage as a woman, an orphan and a Jew -- and yet has immense persistence and an insatiable ambition of becoming a doctor. The film includes more than one plot twist (the final one further complicating the issue of Lea's identity), but it's first and foremost a testimony to a spirit impossible to suppress.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rvp29wXKk3pDGU3ITghDLLWvX7d.jpg", "actors": ["Pola Negri (Lea, the Professor's Adopted Daughter)", "Harry Liedtke (Demetri, a Medical Student)", "Victor Janson (Ossip Storki)", "Adolf E.
