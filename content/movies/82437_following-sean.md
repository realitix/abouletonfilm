The city was awash with the trappings of America\u2019s cultural revolution-the San Francisco State University campus flooded with cops in riot gear, the Haight filled with drifters and idealists, and, on the third floor of Arlyck\u2019s building, a come-one-come-all crashpad apartment. It was from this top floor commune that the precocious 4-year-old Sean would occasionally wander downstairs to visit and talk-and one day Arlyck turned on his camera.  Sean\u2019s casual commentary on everything from smoking pot to living with speed freaks was delivered in simple sincerity throughout the soon-to-be famous 15-minute film. This First Child of the notorious decade may have shaken the audience with his simple sentence- \u201cSure, I smoke pot\u201d-but it was his barefoot impishness which would encapsulate the hope that lay in front of the nation: a promise of infinite possibility.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h0bOiz7VcmmcLoiOJVXLYuvt4bb.jpg", "actors": ["Ralph Arlyck (Narrator (voice))", "Sean Farrell (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
