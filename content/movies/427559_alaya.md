The viewer is the star. N. D.  \u201dAlaya manages a perfection of \u2018musical\u2019 light across a space of time greater in length than would seem possible (consider how brief most such perfected works are, such as Peter Kubelka, say) \u2026 and with minimal means of line and tone. \u2026 After about three minutes I began to be aware of the subtlety of rhythm, within each shot and shot-to-shot, which carried each cut, causing each new image to sit in-the-light of those several previous \u2026 a little short of a miracle.
