Meanwhile, the diabolical megalomaniac robot inventor Highbrow wants to take advantage of Robotchi and his inventor, Dr. Deco, so he and his female cohorts, could have the world all to themselves. But it won't be so easy, since Robotchi, Deco and their pals have tricks of their own up their sleeves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gEpOVBfL5JEXlUmKngT6a1bHYIy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
