This DVD was filmed at Irvine Meadows, California on 12 June 1982. The show was part of the delayed continuation of the \"Diary of a Madman\" tour following the tragic death of Randy Rhoads in March 1982 in a flying accident earlier on the tour. The show features guitarist Brad Gillis who was brought in to replace Randy Rhoads. The concert is a perfect snapshot of Ozzy's live performances in the 80s with dramatic staging and masses of energy with a set list based around his first 2 solo albums and a few Black Sabbath classics. Ozzy has always been one of heavy metal's great frontmen and, despite the difficult circumstances, this show captures him at his absolute best.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zz1ztWywL319DxpInRhfMOx1OIH.jpg", "actors": ["Ozzy Osbourne (Vocals)", "Brad Gillis (Guitars)", "Rudy Sarzo (Bass)", "Tommy Aldridge (Himself - Drums)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
