This was their first ever performance at the Utica Memorial Auditorium in New York. With a capacity of only 5,500, Utica was the smallest venue on Phish's fall tour and the atmosphere was charged with electricity. The 2 DVD set presents three hours of Phish in an intimate venue with an inspired audience that returned the energy at every turn.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5PvJS1RG3U2DxNNBv43u4qliSX6.jpg", "actors": ["Trey Anastasio ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
