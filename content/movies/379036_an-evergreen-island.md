It remains closed to this day. In response, a blockade was imposed around the island. From scratch, the Bougainvilleans built their own schools, they revived their traditional bush medicines, they used solar and hydro power to generate electricity, but the most fascinating invention was the use of fermented coconut oil as a substitute for fuel. \"An Evergreen Island\" is a story of courage, survival and persistence - of inventiveness, imagination and creativity on a little-known Pacific island.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Mandy King (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
