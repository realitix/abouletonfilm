Mom tells him what a no-account his dad really was, setting sail for Hawaii (\"no, Maw, it was Catalina\") right after the kids were born. Peter is unswayed, and takes off. He turns a barrel into a boat, and crews it with an annoyingly talkative duckling, then sets sail on a lake. They get caught in a thunderstorm (the duck loves it). Peter calls for help and momma comes running, but the duck has already saved him. But he still wants to be a sailor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2qq1oEL8H1M4ODITdHJIJJIWCuW.jpg", "actors": ["Elvia Allman (Mama)", "Mel Blanc (Gabby Duckling)", "Billy Bletcher (Papa Parrot)", "Robert Winkler (Peter Parrot)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
