Speaking of whom, the film shows how The Beatles were recording SGT. PEPPER\u2019S at the same studio when the Floyd boys were recording THE PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN (1967) and how the Fab Four were influenced by Floyd\u2019s creative and boundless psychedelia.\r\n\r\nThis leaves 30 minutes for the rest of their career, including the most important period revolving around DARK SIDE OF THE MOON (1973), WISH YOU WERE HERE (1975), ANIMALS (1977) and THE WALL (1979), with ANIMALS being inexplicably omitted altogether!\r\n\r\nStill, what's here is very good with lots of footage from the era in question and interviews with the surviving band members & Co."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
