In addition, this DVD documents major parts of the band's story: Neal's last two acoustic shows with the band. These two performances were the only promotion for \"Snow\", because shortly after that Neal announced his departure from Spock's Beard. At that time, however, Neal had already come to this decision, so during the unplugged gigs he was fighting back his tears. There was no concert tour for the album.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fKebHVB0iOYuNTqvmKUXBAM35F5.jpg", "actors": ["Neal Morse (Himself)", "Alan Morse (Himself)", "Ryo Okumoto (Himself)", "Dave Meros (Himself)", "Nick D'Virgilio (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
