It also had a fulminating effect on Ernesto Baca, one of the pillars of experimental cinema in Argentina. Requiem for a forgotten film begins with that emotional blow, with the director in the first person, in a proposal that intercalates biographical elements (his life in Florencio Varela , the relationship with his mother, his teachers, the influence of Claudio Caldini, and ... until his own wake!) with others of (science) fiction, in which Baca himself appears as a scientist in his laboratory, activating devices with the goal of carrying out Proyecto argenta, the first virgin film of national industry that allows him - and also his group of friends of the Super 8 Club - to continue filming against the digital advance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8tp77r0N2nxJ7VUzhZvrFU6K486.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
