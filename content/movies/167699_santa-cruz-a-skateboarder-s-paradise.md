It was a destination that any discerning skater had to make a trip to. No cops. No hassles. Just skating and rad vibes, the way it was supposed to be. Not to mention the most righteous terrain on the planet. It seemed like it would last forever, but like any society built on a single premise, Santa Cruz started to decay, and what was once a skateboarder\u2019s paradise became a filthy beach ghetto. It\u2019s still all about the skating and not much else. That\u2019s probably why the city fell apart in the first place\u2026\u2014Terkin Von Knobske", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rLzQmAuT4IIeJFKC2FVS8d6jzT7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
