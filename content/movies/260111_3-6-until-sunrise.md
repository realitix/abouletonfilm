Tired of eternity, he wanders through the world questioning humans and his own nature; constantly remembering the lost connection he had with his 'Creator'...

A symbolic tale of mankind and the involution of our values.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vgzl9d0lmmyPFQmKo4lgjoOXvqm.jpg", "actors": ["Gustavo Leone (The Vampire)", "Ariadne D\u00edaz (The Woman)", "Omar Germenos (The Creator)", "Amarie Lee (Erika)", "Jeniffer Liutti (Ana)", "Rachel Vallori (Laura)", "Molly Dugan (Liliana)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
