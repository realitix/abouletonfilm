He dreams of building a fortune by running a brothel himself and returning to the States to lead a life of luxury. Savvy but not unsavory he strikes up a friendship with William Leigh (Denholm Elliot), a genial and decent auditor who travels to Singapore every year. Ultimately, the background of the Vietnam War comes into the picture as Jack is offered the opportunity by the CIA to run a brothel for the R&amp;R activities of U.S. soldiers on leave in Singapore.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gZF4oJMu39frTWQKjMo1HQ3nLhi.jpg", "actors": ["Ben Gazzara (Jack Flowers)", "Denholm Elliott (William Leigh)", "James Villiers (Frogget)", "Joss Ackland (Yardley)", "Rodney Bewes (Smale)", "Mark Kingston (Yates)", "Lisa Lu (Mrs. Yates)", "George Lazenby (Senator)", "Peter Bogdanovich (Eddie Schuman)", "Monika Subramaniam (Monika)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [185181, 76388, 269969, 104366], "youtube_key": "228NZuLOosw"}
