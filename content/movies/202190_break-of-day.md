Instead of obsessing on loss, she insists, one must accept it; at a certain age one must recognize the limits of human relationships and transfer one's attentions to nature.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kj9wv6xqs0CqBv56rpjfuO91ju2.jpg", "actors": ["Dani\u00e8le Delorme ()", "Dominique Sanda ()", "Jean Sorel ()", "Orane Demazis ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
