Oxford University Professor of Neuroscience Colin Blakemore gives viewers an overview of Christianity's historically volatile relationship with science in this amusing and thought provoking film.  Blakemore explains that tolerance for scientific inquiry and challenges to church doctrine were generally tolerated until a turning point in the 1500s. It was at this time accusations of heresy started to arise and scholars too often found themselves branded as heretics. Scientists and educators were forced underground lest they be tortured into confessions of heresy, a crime punishable by execution.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4vDlcYwPE3PTf6Ba5ejZu9yotp0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
