One hundred and fifty years in the future, Africa has become a single, sprawling metropolis controlled by a race of immortal beings, and full of regular mortals dying from a disease called Bad Luck. As Wanita leaves home one morning, a prayer to her ancestors unwittingly starts her on a path to the Dimsi \u2014 another dimension, invisible to the eye, but discoverable by the soul. Can Wanita follow her DNA to break free from the shackles of the immortals? A purposely unfinished work, NAKED REALITY boldly leaves the audience with a blank canvas to interpret and create, as Bekolo grants viewers access to limitless answers waiting to be unearthed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oAdNCXJ9INhTM0GRxCxHceus0W9.jpg", "actors": ["Weza Da Silva (Wanita)", "Luthuli Dlamini (Poet)", "Akin Omotoso (Madiba)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Rp5GTWcmEwE"}
