In the Soviet Union of the late 1950s this was thought to be equivalent to the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. This musical involves the tribulations of four couples whose lives humorously intersect.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/svv70G2EwEIPhH4CuOBlZwU7BcI.jpg", "actors": ["Olga Zabotkina (Lida)", "Vladimir Vasilyev (Boris)", "Marina Khotuntseva (Masha)", "Vladimir Zemlyanikin (Sergei)", "Vasiliy Merkurev (Fedor Drebednev)", "Marina Polbentseva (Vava)", "Evgeni Leonov (Barabashkin)", "Fyodor Nikitin (Baburov)", "Konstantin Sorokin (Kurochkin)", "Svetlana Zhivankova (Lyusya)", "Rina Zelyonaya (Kurochkina)", "Sergei Filippov (Mylkin)", "Emiliya Treyvas (Mylkina)", "Mikhail Pugovkin (Kovalyov)", "Eduard Khil (Vocalist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
