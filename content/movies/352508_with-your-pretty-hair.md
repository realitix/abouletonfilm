Another man misses his train. While the couple talks things over on the platform, two lanky kids come down the stairs, clearly looking for trouble. When they start badgering the solitary man, the couple looks on anxiously and impotently. Even when the threats take on a violent nature, they do not have the courage to intervene.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/japgtyoonQ9JyCK9Zl23JxBT1y3.jpg", "actors": ["Tijn Docter ()", "Jurriaan Fuchs ()", "Clemens Levert ()", "David Lucieer ()", "Karien Noordhoff ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
