Never seen in her lifetime, they were found by chance in a Chicago storage locker and auctioned off cheaply.  Now Vivian Maier has gone viral and her magical pictures sell for thousands of dollars. Vivian was a tough street photographer, a secret poet of suburbia. In life she was a recluse, a hoarder, spinning tall tales about her French roots.
