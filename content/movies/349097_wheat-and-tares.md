This documentary tells the story of three families in their conviction of this believe. They dedicate their entire life to their conviction, because they don't have the slightest doubt about the coming events, such as a worldwide earthquake and the death of half the human population.

What will eventually be left of their ideas, after nothing happens on May 21st 2011...?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
