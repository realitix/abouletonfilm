The two slave girls from beyond infinity get stranded on a planet. They encounter a wealthy land-owner, and then the adventures begin.\r\n\r\nThis movie has scantily-clad women, robotic sidekicks, a hammy villain, campy dialogue, cheesy sets, everything you need for the genre.\r\n\r\nThe script and the editing work better than most b-budget films. The directing and acting fit the mood. Even the sets and the robots, cheap as they are, stand well compared to other films made at this economic level."}], "recommandations_id": [29795, 31253]}
