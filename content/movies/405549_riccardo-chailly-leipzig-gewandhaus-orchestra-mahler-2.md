At Leipzig\u2019s International Mahler Festival, to mark the centenary of Mahler\u2019s death, they performed his monumental Second Symphony in the Gewandhaus \u2013 together with two marvellous soloists and choral forces quite beyond compare. About the final movement the composer said: \u201cThe increasing tension, working up to the final climax, is so tremendous that I don\u2019t know myself, now that it is over, how I ever came to write it.\u201d The painting \u201cMorgenrot\u201d was chosen by internationally acclaimed artist Neo Rauch to feature on the cover of this release on DVD and Blu-ray.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A0Jmya6z9laan6GNvG2IhfOTZvY.jpg", "actors": ["Sarah Connolly (Soloist)", "Christiane Oelze (Soloist)", "Riccardo Chailly (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
