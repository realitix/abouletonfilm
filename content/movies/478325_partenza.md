Metaphorically, they address a story about departure, waiting and separation, dictated by migrations. In the early 20th century, it was usual yet traumatic for men to leave Croatian islands (mostly bound for the countries of South America) due to poverty and hunger. One of these tragic stories is weaved into the author\u2019s family history. The installation is inspired by the life story of Renata\u2019s great-grandmother who lived on the island of Bra\u010d, whose husband went to Chile looking for work in order to secure his family\u2019s future. Like many of the island\u2019s women, she waited for her husband who, like many of the men, never returned.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rKYyTixnNNJQJbMezsQEicKKQpS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
