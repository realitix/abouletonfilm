Its subject is the story of the advancing  Mongol army's entry to Great Kitezh and the city's subsequent miraculous survival. Rejecting archaisms and the more religiously inclined suggestions of  his librettist, Rimsky-Korsakov sought to create an opera that 'is contemporary and even fairly advanced'. It is therefore through-composed, hinting at times at  Wagnerian procedure, and flooded with the composer's rich, apt and brilliant orchestral palette, fully supportive of the powerful vocal writing.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Mikhail Gubsky ()", "Tatiana Monogarova ()", "Mikhail Kazakov ()", "Gevorg Hakobyan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
