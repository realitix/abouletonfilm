Billy loses his job just as he learns that Julie is pregnant and, desperately intent upon providing a decent life for his family, he is coerced into being an accomplice to a robbery. Caught in the act and facing the certainty of prison, he takes his own life and is sent 'up there.' Billy is allowed to return to earth for one day fifteen years later, and he encounters the daughter he never knew. She is a lonely, friendless teenager, her father's reputation as a thief and bully having haunted her throughout her young life. How Billy instills in both the child and her mother a sense of hope and dignity is a dramatic testimony to the power of love.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Robert Goulet (Billy Bigelow)", "Mary Grover (Julie Jordan)", "Pernell Roberts (Jigger Craigin)", "Marlyn Mason (Carrie Pipperidge)", "Charles Ruggles (The Starkeeper / Dr. Selden)", "Michael F.
