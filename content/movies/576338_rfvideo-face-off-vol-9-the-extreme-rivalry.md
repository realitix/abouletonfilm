We had the Von Erichs/Freebirds feud in the 80\u2019s.  Hogan and Piper battled all over the country during the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s but one of the biggest feuds ever during the 90\u2019s was with two of the most extreme athletes of all time from the land of barbed wire, Tommy Dreamer and Raven.  This was by far one of wrestling biggest and longest running feuds of all time.  These men made history for over a decade battling each other on many different continents. Now for the first time RF VIDEO was able to get these two to Face Off with each other and talk about their historic program.  What made it work and stand out and how did they get it to last so long.
