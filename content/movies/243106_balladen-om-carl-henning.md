When he isn't working, he tinkers on a disabled car and dreams of a young girl who is a local student. After a few too many beers one night, he steals some money from the till at work. He is caught by the foreman, who beats the young man. Carl-Henning defends himself and knocks the man down a flight of stairs. Convinced he has murdered the man, Carl runs away and joins up with a traveling carnival. Although the foreman has only a slight bump on the head and all is forgiven, Carl never receives word he is welcome to return and begins a series of adventures that take him far beyond the farm.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2x0o5r8D0flisRTR4JW6VpdKXQf.jpg", "actors": ["Jesper Klein (Carl Henning)", "Paul H\u00fcttel (Poul - Carls kammerat)", "Inge Baaring ()", "Edith Thrane ()", "Ejnar Larsen ()", "Mime F\u00f8nss ()", "Preben Borggaard ()", "John Wittig ()", "Kai Christoffersen ()", "Suzzie M\u00fcllertz ()", "Birgitte Rasmussen ()", "June Belli ()", "Olaf Ussing ()", "Henry Krogs\u00f8e ()", "Ellen Staal ()", "Maia ()", "Poul Glargaard ()", "Medert Ehmsen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
