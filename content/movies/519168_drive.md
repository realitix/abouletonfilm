The driver is a brilliant theorist and cultural analyst who's been driven close to insanity by the vicious cycles of daily life and their eternal repetition. He's against all kind of spontaneity and knows all his tautological essays by heart. He torments his passenger by ceaselessly describing them to him, without a trace of compassion. The passenger, on the other hand, is a completely normal young man, unsure of his place in the world, preoccupied with a failed love-affair. The film investigates a number of difficult topics and complicated theories while it tells the simple story about the driver's and the passenger's last trip together.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
