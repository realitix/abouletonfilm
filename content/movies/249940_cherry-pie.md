She hitch-hikes, pilfers a meal from a gas station, encounters strangers who could be her next ride or a passing glimpse, ambling toward some unknown destination.  At the end of her pilgrimage, Zo\u00e9 reaches the English Channel; on the ferry a woman mysteriously disappears.  A new coat gives Zo\u00e9 a new identity, but even in a new country she's not quite sure she's escaped herself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g3GGiozm6X95IiDyuOen32q2iZG.jpg", "actors": ["Lolita Chammah (Zo\u00e9)", "Marie-Claire Boscher (Woman)", "Fiorella Campanella (Woman)", "Henrie Campanella ()", "Orfeo Campanella ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
