This poetic documentary introduces us to her creations - houses built from clay, bamboo, slate and river stone, constructed in tribute to their natural surroundings. At the age of 86, Didi Contractor pursues her vision working day and night - dreaming her designs then designing her dreams. She sketches roughly, then proportions with pinpoint accuracy, the blueprints for economically and ecologically sustainability.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9Xf105qOmmPNrynBtzYu37CG1Pg.jpg", "actors": ["Didi Contractor (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
