His first perk is the beautiful BARBARA MILLS (electrifying lesbo of The Love Garden) who wants the promotion for her hubby, Edgar. \"If I come across, how do I know you\u2019ll come across?\" she asks Keith before grinding into his groin on the living room carpet.  Elsewhere, hapless junior exec Jerry wonders aloud to his horny wife CAPRI (College Girls): \"Do you think I\u2019ve got perspiration odor?\" Rubbing his crotch, she replies, \"Work up a sweat and I\u2019ll let you know.\" Instead, she works Keith into a lather and improves her husband\u2019s position at the office by doing the missionary on Keith\u2019s couch.  Harvey, an aspiring but unmarried executive, decides to pass off Greta, a blonde busty topless dancer, as his wife in order to get in good with Keith.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sbqaQ7Eo7jpYaqXYyektz1jT8Ol.jpg", "actors": ["Marland Proctor (Jerry)", "Elizabeth Knowles (Anne)", "John Keith (Mark)", "Capri (Lucille)", "Barbara Mills (Susie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
