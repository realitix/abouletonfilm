Following it, they find themselves on a vast, deserted Long Island estate. Entering, they begin to become civilized and assume the stereotypical roles and dress of people at a weekend party. There follows an allegory of upper-class behavior. At last, they begin to devolve toward their original status, and after a battle at croquet, they disappear into the woods.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ijp9SSI0lQwU3nVLEiSjUEg0Tc3.jpg", "actors": ["Lewis J.
