Then in quick succession the flags of Germany, Russia, Ireland, England and China are brought forth, and from each a soldier is produced corresponding with the flag of each nation. The magician adds a bit of comedy to the scene by producing a decidedly Hibernian policeman from the flag of Erin's Isle. The magician then waves his hand and the flags of all nations slowly dissolve and blend into one huge American flag.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nFt69tIrKv8kjJNi4YxC4VQebm2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
