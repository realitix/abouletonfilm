(It may date to their mother's leaving the family.) Martin is philosophical, romantic, and poetic: he dreams of being the son of a shark; he holds tight to a book about goldfish his mother gave him. In both halting and wild ways, he tries to court Marie, a neighbor girl. Simon, with a pocketknife and an intractable will, seems more dangerous to others. What, on earth, is there for these children-becoming-men?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5x9jExZT55zCT4zL58t1O3AnzLJ.jpg", "actors": ["Ludovic Vandendaele (Martin)", "Eric Da Silva (Simon)", "Sandrine Blancke (Marie)", "Maxime Leroux (Le p\u00e8re)", "Yolande Moreau (L'automobiliste)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
