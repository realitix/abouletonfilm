One hundred days before Obama's inauguration, these young men have joined the Marines together to face the obstacles and circumstances that seem to overwhelm their passage into manhood. Luis wants to be a filmmaker and Ronald wants to travel the world and raise a family. Through the lens of Luis's video camera, they capture their friends, family members and places they call home - to remember who they are and where they come from. In their darkest hour, they turn on the video camera for the last time and document the final moments of their journey home. They soon realize that their dreams and promises of a new life mean nothing in a place called War.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vTP6fg41ntHyWfqfDnEz9kNXdiM.jpg", "actors": ["Malcolm Goodwin (Ronald)", "Jamil Walker Smith (Luis)", "Michael Trotter (Marty)", "Bradley Stryker (Chuck)", "Eddie Ruiz (Lloyd)", "Justin Shenkarow (Paul)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "VSrKQo7Mmkc"}
