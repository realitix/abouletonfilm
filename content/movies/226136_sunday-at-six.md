A boy meets a girl. They fall in love without suspecting anything about their real identities. They chose an eventful, tense and dangerous life as underground anti-fascists fighters. The significance of their activity is manifest in the consequences it has on the tormented progress of their love. Reality is against it. Two parallel lines which meet for a second, only to drift apart for ever.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/khq798mkntY65Wx6Q1VMeGKUoUF.jpg", "actors": ["Irina Petrescu (Anca)", "Dan Nu\u021bu (Radu)", "Graziela Albini (Maria)", "Eugenia Popovici (Mama Ancai)", "Dorina Nila-Bentamar (Fata de la mare)", "Eugenia Bos\u00e2nceanu (mama lui Radu)", "Marcel Gingulescu (tatal Ancai)", "Costel Constantinescu (Liralul)", "Constantin Cojocaru (Pustiul)", "Catalina Pintilie (Ioana)", "Lidia Gabor ()", "Serban Holban ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
