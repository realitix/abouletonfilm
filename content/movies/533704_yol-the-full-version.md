In order to qualify for leave, the detainees are required to have served a third of their sentence and have a record of faultless conduct. Insult, physical maltreatment, repression, forced labour and arbitrariness are normal in Turkish prisons. For those detainees who await leave, only one attitude remains: resignation and submission.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/glmZAiyZQaIKG6bRBobtCMkqmYy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
