Mostly because it's been a long time coming, but the hype has only grown since a couple of years ago.\r\n\r\nThis movie is all drama; very serious, as it should be. The plot has a very stern tone, but I think it could have lightened up a couple of times with humour instead of keeping me in perpetual suspense.\r\n\r\nAs a video editor, there were a few aspects that I would have liked to change (can't really put my finger on it now), but I know I can't do anything about it now.\r\n\r\nI really liked watching Kenneth Copeland act; it's a nice change of pace from what he usually does, and every Eric Roberts makes every scene better with his acting experience among a crowd of newcomers."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "LD2HPAeKzms"}
