While he's doing this, Popeye makes him lose his concentration, so in retaliation, the hypnotist pulls Olive on stage and turns her into a chicken. Popeye comes down to fight and the hypnotist tries to turn him into a monkey, but Popeye pulls a mirror into place. He recovers, and turns Popeye into a donkey, then smacks him around a bit, but spinach comes to the rescue.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6O5Gxj4Des6COz5T0FJ8xmsbxzB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
