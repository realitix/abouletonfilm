Anticipating later writings by Roland Barthes and Susan Sontag (who professed her admiration for the film) If I Had Four Dromedaries reveals Marker's instinctual understanding of the secret rapport between still and moving image.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5RbsdsffZWulqCyDvSmVKTuTJDC.jpg", "actors": ["Pierre Vaneck (R\u00e9citant (voice))", "Nicolas Youmatoff (R\u00e9citant (voice))", "Catherine Le Couey (R\u00e9citante (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
