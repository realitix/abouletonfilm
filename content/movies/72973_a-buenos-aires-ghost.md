The kid and the ghost make a pledge: the latter will tell the former what exists beyond death if he allows him to inhabit his body for a whole day. Thus, the ghost will go around an unrecognizable twenty first century Buenos Aires to uncover the causes of his own death. Along the way, the two become friends as the spirit helps the young man overcome his shyness. The film offers suspense, irony, emotion and a reflection upon the changes brought about by the lapse of time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zSO3iVNTZZHKhGSQYCphj8r2X5e.jpg", "actors": ["Iv\u00e1n Espeche (Canaveri)", "Rom\u00e1n Tanoni (Pablo)", "Juan Diego West (Claudio)", "Paula Brasca ()", "Ana Celentano ()", "Felipe Colombo ()", "Lisandro Rodr\u00edguez ()", "Estanislao Silveyra ()", "Francisco Su\u00e1rez ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
