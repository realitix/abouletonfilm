Her dance is visually 'echoed' by close-up superimpositions of her arms, legs, and feet, and then later by her distant figure seeming to mimic and/or perhaps to control her foregrounded, cometimes back-lit, image. She often pauses thoughtfully in her dance, breaks step, walks away, etc., defining the perimeters of the dance. Finally she appears naked, midst dance, and takes heraldic stance at end.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
