It is not to be confused with the incomplete (and now lost) 1955 film Welles made of his meta-play Moby Dick\u2014Rehearsed, or with Moby Dick (1956 film), in which Welles played a supporting role. The film consists of readings by Welles from the book Moby Dick, shot against a blue background with various optical illusions to give the impression of being at sea. It was made during a break in the filming of The Other Side of the Wind. There is some ambiguity about what Welles intended to do with the footage, and how he was going to compile it. It remained unedited in his lifetime.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d9t5xxstu84cxjnknDGdl5tCggN.jpg", "actors": ["Orson Welles (Captain Ahab / Starbuck / Ishmael (archive footage))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
