Three years later, Kohji is working the streets as a hustler, still yearning for a way to earn his estranged father's approval to continue his borderline incestuous relationship. Hiroko sees a way back to her brother's arms when Sando's shady colleague Marc Tanner (Fran\u00e7ois Trottier) absconds to Canada with gambling funds destined for the big boss. Presumably with her father's permission, she calls Kohji and tells him to hurry to Montr\u00e9al, recover the money and kill Tanner.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uIlXwWeE7HWnZGbSorSbUcxy42v.jpg", "actors": ["Yusuke Iseya ()", "Gabrielle Lazure ()", "Ryo Kase ()", "Kumi Kaneko ()", "Y\u014dsuke Natsuki ()", "Fran\u00e7ois Trottier ()", "Veroushka Knoge ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "OaTLH3D0DQo"}
