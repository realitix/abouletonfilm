PRAY FOR JAPAN takes place in the devastated region of Ishinomaki, Miyagi - the largest coastal city in Tohoku with a population of over 160,000 people. Filmmaker Stu Levy - an American living in Japan - filmed the tsunami aftermath during his trips to Tohoku as a volunteer and over a period of 6 weeks, captured over 50 hours of footage. PRAY FOR JAPAN focuses on four key perspectives of the tragedy - School, Shelter, Family, and Volunteers. With each perspective we meet victims who faced significant obstacles and fought to overcome them. Through these four vantage points, the audience is able to understand the vast ramifications of this large-scale natural disaster - and the battle these real-life heroes fought on behalf of their loved ones and their hometown.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zoYy1KyHmmvmMMgcloue3btSgFx.jpg", "actors": ["Hiroyuki Abe (Himself)", "Najeeb Ullah Ayaz (Himself)", "Shu Chiba (Himself)", "Manabu Endo (Himself)", "Kento Ito (Himself)", "Shuki Ito (Himself)", "Tsukasa Kurosawa (Himself)", "Mitsunori Monma (Himself)", "Anees Ahmad Nadeem (Himself)", "Hideo Otsuki (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "E831WHWPV-c"}
