Just recently, he was Sweden\u2019s hottest politician. Stylish, funny, popular and the obvious candidate as the country\u2019s next Prime Minister. Now, two years and a disappointing election defeat later, he finds himself in free fall. The voters have deserted him, the party is in uproar and he can hardly manage to get out of bed.
