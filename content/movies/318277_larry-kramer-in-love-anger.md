Co-founder of both the service organization Gay Men's Health Crisis and the direct action protest group ACT UP, Kramer was vilified by some who saw his criticism to be an expression of self-hatred, while lionized by others who credit him with waking up the gay community \u2014 and, eventually, the government and medical establishment \u2014 to the devastation of the disease.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4DfNpuSD2rZdOKooULiFXqbpcer.jpg", "actors": ["Larry Kramer (Himself)", "Anthony Fauci (Himself)", "George C.
