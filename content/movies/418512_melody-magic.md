His band singer Marjory Logan and The Tune Twisters (male trio) sing two more Green songs (both with lyrics by James Dyrenforth): \"What Now\" and \"Not Bad.\" Green chastises his second pianist (and arranger), Dave Terry, for infringing on Green's musical territory. With the aid of trick photography, Green, with a wave of his baton, reduces the orchestra to miniature size, then Dave Terry does the same to Green. The film closes with an intricate version of \"Sweet Sue-Just You\"(Victor Young-Will Harris), featuring Green's saxophone section.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Johnny Green (Himself)", "Marjory Logan (Herself - Singer)", "Dave Terry (Himself - Pianist)", "Tune Twisters (Themselves)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
