Sir George signs a contract, promising that the marriage will take place on Dorothy's 18th birthday, or else he will have to pay a large penalty to Rutland. But when the two children have grown older, rumors of John's wild behavior in France provoke Sir George to call off the engagement, and to pledge his daughter instead to her cousin Malcolm. Rutland now claims the forfeit from Sir George, and meanwhile, John has befriended Mary Stuart, the sworn enemy of Elizabeth, who is now Queen of England.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jZkgBUUAoF1AUuFc7HURqOcAajI.jpg", "actors": ["Mary Pickford (Dorothy Vernon)", "Anders Randolf (Sir George Vernon)", "Marc McDermott (Sir Malcolm Vernon)", "Carrie Daumery (Lady Vernon)", "Allan Forrest (Sir John Manners)", "Lottie Pickford (Jennie Faxton (as Lottie Pickford Forrest))", "Wilfred Lucas (Earl of Rutland)", "Clare Eames (Queen Elizabeth)", "Estelle Taylor (Mary, Queen of Scots)", "Courtenay Foote (Earl of Leicester)", "Colin Kenny (Dawson)", "Julie Bishop (Child Extra (as Jacqueline Wells))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
