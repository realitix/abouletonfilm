It\u2019s a story closely tied to a love of gardens and a desire to preserve nature in a rapidly urbanizing nation. Travelling to studios, gardens and iconic locations throughout the United States, UK and France, this mesmerising film is a feast for the eyes.  The Artist\u2019s Garden: American Impressionism features the sell-out exhibition The Artist\u2019s Garden: American Impressionism and the Garden Movement, 1887\u20131920 that began at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and ended at the Florence Griswold Museum, Old Lyme, Connecticut.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bCJbOYUIEYQTCzaXHaqq4PNbvEP.jpg", "actors": ["Gillian Anderson (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
