As a young boy, Enzo dreamt of being an opera singer, a journalist or a racing driver, instead he created one of the most recognised company names in the modern world. During his 50-year reign he rarely left Maranello the spiritual home of his beloved race teams and birthplace of the sports cars against which all others are judged and remained a very private man. This superb racing documentary by acclaimed Formula One producer John Tully reveals the essence of the man and his machines. The story is told from childhood, through 4 decades of racecar development, to a visit by the Pope (in an open top Ferrari Pope-Mobile of course!) shortly before Ferrari s death in 1988. Narrated by Christopher Lee, this is the definitive Ferrari documentary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lQiK0YSW85f2r22GoFgMetAhIHL.jpg", "actors": ["Enzo Ferrari ()", "Christopher Lee (Narrator)", "Niki Lauda ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
