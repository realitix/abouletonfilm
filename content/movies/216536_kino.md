The Viennale has chosen Marker\u2019s work as its \u201canniversary trailer\u201d because in it, Marker \u2013 like no other director before him \u2013 deals with the history of cinema in a playful and surprising manner. More precisely, he deals with the question of \u201cthe perfect viewer\u201d that cinema has been looking for since the father of film, D. W. Griffith. Chris Marker ultimately finds this ideal viewer at the end of his small essay in an unexpected figure.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s19sunZQFZwibzUwzaw9Wd0Ftdb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [308692, 209808, 280062, 105153], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
