But despite a hefty investment, little of substance was forthcoming, except for \"Apple Records\".  \"This is the story of a record label which came to exist under extraordinary circumstances, produced extraordinary records and was operated under extraordinary guidelines...\"  \"Strange Fruit\" offers new interviews with Tony Bramwell, members of 'Badfinger', 'The Iveys', 'Elephant's Memory', Jackie Lomax, 'Brute Force' and David Peel, plus commentator Chris Ingham, author, journalist Mark Paytress and Apple biographer Stefan Granados.  The film also includes Apple music, archive footage of Apple artists, interviews from the vaults, rare images and location films.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zAjErVUJ9q5lio0THqJryxsFEx6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
