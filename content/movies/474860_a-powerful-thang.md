The spirited, African-identified Yasmine Allen is a writer and single mother who has been dating saxophone teacher Craig Watkins for a month. Wishing to end her self-imposed celibacy following her son's birth, Yasmine has reached a turning point in the relationship-but Craig, the Big Lug, wants to take it slow. Sage advice from friends and family members remind them, \"sex is a powerful thang.\" Like her highly acclaimed CYCLES, Davis's film incorporates animation as well as Afro-Haitian dance in a rich exploration of the lives of African Americans.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jDWXYlSKYhpeXXrgwtePeb6NFxs.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
