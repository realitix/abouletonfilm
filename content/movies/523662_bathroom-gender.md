With the camera positioned as a mirror over the sink, the women proceed to douse their chins with shaving cream, shave and slowly get dressed in male black tie mode. Indulging in the secret pleasures of acting out the bathroom rituals of men, this film makes a playful and witty foray into gender bending and cross-dressing.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
