About this time last year we sat down with a bunch of our athletes and staff and came up with the idea to create a 4FRNT Team movie. After the success of last year's Tech Talk series we knew we had the ability to create an entire movie, we just needed the right equipment and planning. Over the summer we started the task of getting a professional video camera kit, setting up a dedicated editing station, and working out athlete and shot lists. We also got a half-dozen GoPro HDs from the folks at GoPro which were great to send off with athletes on their different trips and adventures. We are also collaborating with other film companies we have relationships with in order to get footage above and beyond what we were able to shoot ourselves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7uRMaWgsp9t04ZRrUr8cJiq0wHg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
