No sooner is the Isokaze on open water, however, then the FTG reveal themselves to be terrorist stowaways who kill the ship's captain, send the rest of the crew overboard and take control of the vessel. The ship is carrying a secret biological weapon which the terrorists are now threatening to use to level Tokyo! Only a stowaway NCO, Sengoko (played by Sanada Hiroyuki from Ring and Twilight Samurai) is in a position to stop them - but does he really have what it takes to save the day? Playing like a cross between a sea-faring version of Top Gun and Die Hard, director Sakamoto Junji shows that it's not just Hollywood that can produce thrill-a-minute action spectaculars.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kzkQIs4lhsMuqziPQFPqLO33jiM.jpg", "actors": ["Hiroyuki Sanada (Hisashi Sengoku)", "Akira Terao (Hirotaka Miyazu)", "Koichi Sato (Diasuke Atsumi)", "Kiichi Nakai (Yong Fa)", "Ryo Katsuji (Kou Kisaragi)", "Chae Min-seo (Jon-hee)", "Eisaku Yoshida (Isamu Takenaka)", "Shosuke Tanihara (Yudai Kazama)", "Masanobu Ando (Don-chol)", "Yoshio Harada (Koichiro Kajimoto)", "Mieko Harada (Yoshie Miyazu)", "Ittoku Kishibe (Kazuma Seto)", "Claude Maki (Yoshiaki Munakata)", "Shunsuke Matsuoka ()", "Jun Hashizume ()", "Sei Hiraizumi ()", "Mansaku Ikeuchi ()", "Miyuki Komatsu ()", "Ken Mitsuishi ()", "Ryu Morioka ()", "Ikuji Nakamura ()", "Seiroku Nakazawa ()", "Katsuhiko Sasaki ()", "Takashi Shikauchi ()", "Kosuke Toyohara ()", "Kenichi Yajima ()", "Yamada Toshiaki ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "x1qZOSofAME"}
