Man \u2014 entirely absent \u2014 is no longer the center of the universe; the canyon exists outside of him. Despite the invisible photographer and his technologically-caused dissolves, this is a creditable approximation of the true foreign-ness of nature.\u201d  \u2014 Amos Vogel, Film as a Subversive Art (1974)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dhT3ViyZCl09uOskL89XHstL8lr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [163102, 39239, 350062, 83909], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
