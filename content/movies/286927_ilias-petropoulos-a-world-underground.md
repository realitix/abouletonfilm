I believe that each one has the right to see the society he lives in with his own particular view. I am, personally, more interested in Devil than God\u201d- Elias Petropoulos. A restless and inquisitive spirit, a foe of academics and the status-quo, Petropoulos was the first folklorist in Greece, who dealt with social outcasts and described people and situations ignored by his country\u2019s official history.
