The year is 1966: The Violas are on tour and driving through Florida when their van suddenly grinds to a halt in a small southern beach town. There, the local authorities are investigating the disappearance of two parents whose daughter was recently found wandering a local beach alone in a state of shock. A strange pile of pungent debris has also washed ashore, leading some locals to suspect that the Skunk Ape may somehow be involved in the incident. Now, with every step closer they come to solving the mystery, the local police begin to realize that local urban legends about a formidable beast that lives on the woods may not be so far-fetched after all. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/97412rjFKZm0sp7VTffGMLtpMHv.jpg", "actors": ["Claire Bronson (Theodora)", "Cynthia Evans (Jody)", "Cynthia Evans (John Patterson)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "dbi3TpN6EbU"}
