In this brand new recording of Ken's classic message, we are confronted with a Moses who reminds us an awful lot of ourselves. With his unique and insightful humor, Ken looks at the five (remarkably contemporary) excuses Moses tried to use to avoid God's call and reminds us that the answers God gave to Moses are the same answers God gives us today. A great tape for the whole family!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d9Iy70ri87uQm5tVXbekG5PgVsE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
