Special attention goes to 'physical' methods of torture in the afterlife, as in Dante's Inferno. Their inspiration stems partially from judicial torments, as used during the Inquisition to redeem 'Satanic' sinners, from witches and heretics to mere gay people. Also treated is hell's theological and 'educational' meaning.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2XOEZvzVXL86XRmj05m47ZPzjYU.jpg", "actors": ["Eva-Maria Kurz ()", "Hamze Bytyci ()", "Judith Evers ()", "Anne Gaedcke ()", "Maurice Ittershagen ()", "Thora Kleinert ()", "Gianni Meurer ()", "Michael Steger ()", "Babett Arnold ()", "Melek Diehl ()", "Lars Feistkorn ()", "Alexander Haugg ()", "Anja Karmanski ()", "Marcus Lachmann ()", "Thilo Prothmann ()", "Bernhard Thomany ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
