Mozart s operas seem to be made for the small but fine opera house in Glyndebourne and it's not surprising that the 1977 Don Giovanni, one of Mozart's great masterpieces, was a huge success. This production is conducted by Bernard Haitink, who holds the opinion, that no other composer had more opera in his blood than Mozart. It has been proven, for example, that Mozart had no overture for Don Giovanni until the evening before the premiere in Prague and wrote it down in just one night. Like the premiere's success of the opera in Prague in 1787 the Glyndebourne's version staged by Peter Hall was praised by audience and critics alike: We witness a lively and wide-awake ensemble piece that has easily survived all these decades, and still manages to teach many directors the art of playing theatre.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5iLHrbTyvHVWGHMxYb9nXDFoBQ6.jpg", "actors": ["Benjamin Luxon (Don Giovanni (bariton))", "Pierre Thau (Commendatore (bass))", "Horiana Br\u0103ni\u0219teanu (Donna Anna (soprano))", "Leo Goeke (Don Ottavio (tenor))", "Rachel Yakar (Donna Elvira (soprano))", "Stafford Dean (Leporello (bass))", "John Rawnsley (Masetto (bass))", "Elizabeth Gale (Zerlina (soprano))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
