Documentaries about punk rock always focus on what was happening in London, New York or L.A. But Brad Warner and his friends didn't live in \"happening\" places like that. Like thousands of other kids all over the country in those days, they made their own scene in their own town out of nothing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xxTgFzukXcIEPZWPwPMaifYp1un.jpg", "actors": ["Brad Warner (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "bDqEOpF4QXY"}
