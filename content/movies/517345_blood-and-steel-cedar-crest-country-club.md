It was a place of pure unadulterated expressionist freedom where cutting edge skateboarding and punk rock music collided and made history. Professional skaters and legendary bands, 11 gauge steel and, of course, blood. \"Blood and Steel: Cedar Crest Country Club\" is the story of a one of a kind skateboarding playground that attracted skaters and bands from all over to come experience what became known simply as, \"The Crest\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6RneUEKJ127a6jbBQquddrMYPfn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
