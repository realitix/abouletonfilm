This 1976 documentary follows the singer-comic during his 1975 Irish tour. Made in a cinema verit\u00e9 fashion, the performer appears to be completely unaware of the presence of the camera in his off-stage and backstage moments.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/phvdBOuL9fpZ74gfZgWF1aomLcL.jpg", "actors": ["Billy Connolly (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
