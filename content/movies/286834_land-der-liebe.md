Director Sch\u00fcnzel who was half Jewish was allowed to work under special commission due to his success with the public (and because Hitler liked his films) which he used for veiled attacks, most famously in Amphitryon. But in 1937 he finally clashed with Goebbels who was furious about this film here which ended Sch\u00fcnzel's German career and by proxy the tradition of quality German musicals which was only shortly revived by Kurt Hoffmann in the 50s.\r The story is one of the usual operetta stories with a young princess being destined to marry a king which her mother (the delicious Valerie von Martens known as Curt Goetz' wife and acting partner) tries to enforce while the young woman tries to escape her destiny and meets a young writer who is almost a double of the king which launches a plot with fake assassinations, tangled love affairs and some subtle satire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ll5xeIJ3wttpeU3e1hdiVRvMlvJ.jpg", "actors": ["Albert Matterstock (K\u00f6nig)", "Gusti Huber (Prinzessin Julia)", "Valerie von Martens (F\u00fcrstin Ilonka)", "Wilhelm Bendow (Ministerpr\u00e4sident)", "Oskar Sima (Polizeipr\u00e4fekt)", "Erik Ode (Erster Beamter)", "Werner Stock (Zweiter Beamter)", "Erich Ziegel (Hofmarschall)", "Erich Fiedler (Leutnant Inpetto)", "Olga Limburg (Madame Revelli - Direktrice)", "Hadrian Maria Netto (Major Roscoe - Adjutant des K\u00f6nigs)", "William Huch (Zeremonienmeister)", "Erich Walter (Diener Kaspar)", "Maria Seidler (Oberin des Klosters)", "Heinz Berghaus (Der Verkehrsminister)", "Edith Dathe ()", "Jac Diehl (Ein vollb\u00e4rtiger Hotelportier (as Jack Diehl))", "Hugo Drahower (Minister des K\u00f6nigs)", "Paul Ludwig Frey (Der Korporal der Leibgarde)", "Guido Goroll (Der Au\u00dfenminister)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
