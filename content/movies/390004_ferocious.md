After the young man runs away from being shackled to a cabin, he spends the winter in a cave and emerges as a bear (obviously a man wearing a bear suit). He is taken in by a writer who teaches him how to use a computer, which somehow poses no problem. The bear speaks like the young man and for awhile tries working as a computer operator, undoubtedly raising questions about the standards in that field. While invited to tea one afternoon, the bear kills a dog in self-defense and is forced to head back to his cave for the winter -- where he emerges after a long hibernation as the young man. In retrospect, contact with the computing world had quite a transforming effect.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xbJGR8sLJBEHJo9zaNxhpTIZBvZ.jpg", "actors": ["Fernando Fern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez ()", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Pasquale ()", "Javier Garc\u00eda ()", "Elene Lizarralde ()", "Julio C\u00e9sar Sanz ()", "Rafael Taibo (Voz en off en la TV)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
