It serves as a discovery of hidden pain that has been haunting her and was finally relieved when she removed herself from the area contaminated by radiation. Yelena Zmushko was inspired to make a documentary \"Chernobyl 20\" which had given her hope to pursue advocacy for truth about the real threat of radioactive exposure and, possibly, inspire other people to search for their own personal truth. \"Chernobyl 20\" proffers a brave, activist agenda through a deeply personal view.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r5SbGM0S1qnZZk1E4gremjseMhB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
