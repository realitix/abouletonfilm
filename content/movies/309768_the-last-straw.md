With the children's constant bickering, pretty packages and a sweet-smelling tree don't come close to filling the McDonald home with the true spirit of the first Christmas.  Then Mom remembers an old tradition of building a soft bed for Baby Jesus one straw at a time.  Each time someone secretly does something nice for another family member, he or she gets to add a single straw to the manager.  Soon the children's quarreling and negative feelings subside and the homemade crib fills with straw.  But for one family member, a required act of kindness becomes more than he can take.  Inspired by a true story with both heart and humor.  The Last Straw may forever change the way your family celebrates Christmas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mcq1kDTeHjRI24mjR8PwjONZXNr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
