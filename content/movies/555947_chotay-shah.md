After the death of his father and relocation of his brother, Asghar has been saddled with the responsibility of his aging mother, who refuses to let go of the past.\r\n\r\nAsghar\u2019s wife Nazia has left home, ostensibly to read for a PhD in London, but in truth, to escape from the claustrophobic relationship between Asghar and Bibi.\r\n\r\nIn his stream of consciousness, Asghar emails Nazia about his dilemma and tells her how much he wants to bring his teenage son to London so they can be a family again. But he is bound by duty to his mother and in terrible debt as he tries to maintain their last kothi while his financial resources dwindle.\r\n\r\nThe film has an ensemble cast with each character bound to the kothi in one way or another.
