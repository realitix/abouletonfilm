The royal monarchs of three major European countries are patiently or not-so-patiently hovering on the sidelines while watching the future King Gustav closely. No single king appears to possess the brains he was born with, so history seems to be made by default, as it were. Gustav does blunder around, but not enough to miss being crowned king. As a result, France, England, and Germany invade Sweden hoping to take by force what they could not gain by incompetence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fpQv0KfqNfx9fRimLTQD9htkkrh.jpg", "actors": ["Per Oscarsson ()", "Ernst G\u00fcnther ()", "John Harryson ()", "Martin Ljung ()", "Sune Mangs ()", "Allan Edwall (Doktor Karl Otto)", "Janne 'Loffe' Carlsson ()", "Lena Nyman ()", "Jarl Borss\u00e9n ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
