In their own words - originally recorded in shorthand - they discuss photography, colour theory, Moliere, the scientific method, the crazy ideas of balloonists, and - of course - how to live for 100 years. These two legends of the 19th century have a lively and interesting conversation. One was born before the French revolution; the other was destined to see the marvels of the aeroplane and the movies.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Nicholas Bell (Chevreul)", "Tim Robertson (Nadar)", "Agn\u00e8s Varda (Herself - Host (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
