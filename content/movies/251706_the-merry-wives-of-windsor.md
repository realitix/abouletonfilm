But the women are up to the old lecher\u2019s tricks and turn the tables on him with a series of humiliating assignations, midnight terrors and a very damp, extremely smelly laundry basket.  Gutsy, colloquial and bustling with vivid characters, The Merry Wives of Windsor is a brilliantly constructed farce and the only comedy Shakespeare set in his native land. It is also the ancestor of English bourgeois comedy and gave birth to a tradition that reaches down to the modern TV sitcom. The production made merry with the relationship between the life of middle-class Elizabethan England and the late medieval period in which the play is set.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dAH8IvQWrrD701M116oc70ZY5Qw.jpg", "actors": ["Christopher Benjamin (Sir John Falstaff)", "Serena Evans (Mistress Page)", "Andrew Havill (Master Ford)", "Gerard McCarthy (Master Fenton)", "Sarah Woodward (Mistress Ford)", "Nathan Amzi (Peter Simple)", "Gareth Armstrong (Evans)", "William Belchambers (Master Slender)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
