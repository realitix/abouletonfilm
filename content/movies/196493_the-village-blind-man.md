The outside locations have probably not been modified and therefore present an interesting reflection of the rural Spain around Valencia. The blind man of the title is not central character of the narrative, a nice twist.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/PB6joOuLSVGzD2lQZH1mfjXwKG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
