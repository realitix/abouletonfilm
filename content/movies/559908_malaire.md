He once lived alone with his son Juste, who helped him to farm the Mauvents land. One night Nogu\u00e8re fired at a couple of trespassers, hurting the girl and killing her fianc\u00e9. Giving Catoune, the girl, the shelter of his home, Nogu\u00e8re was forced - however reluctantly it may have been - to break the bad news to the fianc\u00e9e. For all that Catoune recovered, settled down and later married Juste. After a while Juste left for the war and was soon reported missing. Nogu\u00e8re comforted the distressed young woman so well that she became her mistress. But Juste had not been killed.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
