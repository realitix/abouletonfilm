He is a normal husband who loves his wife Krishnendu  a lot, but she is too possessive about him. She thinks he is not very expressive about his feelings, and is always worried that he might one day fall for some other beautiful girl.  Rahul  is just the opposite. He is extremely romantic and never comes home without some cute gifts for his wife, Shreya. But she doesn't know that, behind her back, her darling husband is dying to flirt with every woman that he sees.  John Mathai  is a photographer in Mukundan's publication. He was neither interested in girls nor keen to get married until he met Sereena .  It is into the lives of these three couples that a bar singer, Diana, arrives and things take some interesting turns.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iKirqW8WF8z0bYB3mdOuZ3pUq99.jpg", "actors": ["Jayaram (Mukundan Menon)", "Indrajith Sukumaran (Rahul Vallyathan)", "Jayasurya (John Mathai)", "Samvrutha Sunil (Shreya)", "Bhavana (Krishnendu)", "Rima Kallingal (Diana Philip)", "Vandana Menon (Sereena)", "Suraj Venjaramoodu (Raj Boss)", "Salim Kumar (Satyapalan/Dharmapalan)", "Maniyanpilla Raju (Pazhakutti Pavithran)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [278403, 201823, 277992, 122835], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
