Even though it is smaller than Earth, its mass is huge enough to crush the Earth and destroy it. A mission sent to observe Gorath is destroyed after all the orbiting ships are drawn into the planetoid. A later mission is sent to observe and the crew barely leaves before suffering the same fate. However Astronaut Tatsuo Kanai is left in a catatonic state due to his near death experience. The Earth's scientists then come up with a desperate plan to build giant rockets at the South Pole to move Earth out of Gorath's path before it is too late.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4IEXr9HK43YUKA9VAam7VEbQVKe.jpg", "actors": ["Ry\u00f4 Ikebe (Dr. Tazawa)", "Yumi Shirakawa (Tomoko Sonoda)", "Akira Kubo (Tatsuma Kanai)", "Kumi Mizuno (Takiko Nomura)", "Hiroshi Tachikawa (Wakabayashi)", "Akihiko Hirata (End\u00f4)", "Kenji Sahara (Saiki)", "Jun Tazaki (Raiz\u00f4 Sonoda)", "Ken Uehara (Dr. K\u00f4no)", "Takashi Shimura (Kensuke Sonoda)", "Seizabur\u00f4 Kawazu (Tada - Minister of Finance)", "Ko Mishima (Sanada)", "Sachio Sakai (Physician)", "Takamaru Sasaki (Prime Minister Seki)", "K\u00f4 Nishimura (Murata - Secretary of Space)", "Eitar\u00f4 Ozawa (Kinami - Minister of Justice)", "K\u00f4z\u00f4 Nomura (Observer of \u00d4tori)", "Keiko Sata (Prime Minister's Secretary)", "Hideyo Amamoto (Man in Bar)", "George Furness (Hooverman)", "Ross Benette (Gibson)", "Jun'ichir\u00f4 Mukai (Space Base Security Guard)", "Nadao Kirino (Manabe)", "Fumio Sakashita (Hayao Sonoda)", "Ikio Sawamura (Taxi Driver)", "Toshihiko Furuta (Observer of \u00d4tori)", "Yoshiyuki Uemura (\u00d4tori Mathematician)", "Rinsaku Ogata (\u00d4tori Engineer)", "Masayoshi Kawabe (\u00d4tori Observer)", "Yasushi Matsubara (\u00d4tori Radio Operator)", "Tadashi Okabe (\u00d4tori Mathematician)", "K\u00f4ji Uno (Reporter)", "Yukihiko Gond\u00f4 (\u00d4tori Pilot)", "Ken'ichir\u00f4 Maruyama (\u00d4tori Engineer)", "Yasuhiko Saij\u00f4 (\u00d4tori Radio Operator)", "Katsumi Tezuka (\u00d4tori Radio Operator)", "Akira Yamada (Hayabusa Engineer)", "Hiroshi Takagi (Hayabusa Engineer)", "Toshitsugu Suzuki (Hayabusa Pilot)", "Wataru \u00d4mae (Hayabusa Mathmatician)", "Ichir\u00f4 Sh\u00f4ji (Hayabysa Observer)", "Yasuo Araki (Hayabusa Observer)", "Hideo Shibuya (Reporter)", "Kazuo Imai (Hayabusa Radio Operator)", "Takuya Yuki (Hayabusa Mathematician)", "Y\u00fbsuke Suzuki (Hayabusa Fuel Checkouter)", "Takuz\u00f4 Kumagai (Government Personnel)", "Hiroshi Akitsu (Government Personnel/ Man pointing at sky)", "Enver Altenbay (South Pole Base Member)", "Ry\u00fbtar\u00f4 Amami (Government Personnel/South Pole Worker)", "Henr\u00ee Ban (Man in convention Hall)", "Hank Brown (South Pole Base Personnel)", "Ichir\u00f4 Chiba (Government Personnel)", "Kenzo Echigo (Otori Astronaut)", "Bin Furuya (Reporter)", "Ted Gunther (South Pole Base Personnel)", "Shinjir\u00f4 Hirota (Government Personnel)", "Hans Horneff (Dr. Konig)", "Tsurue Ichimanji (Sonoda Family Maid)", "Toku Ihara (South Pole Base Worker)", "Sabur\u00f4 Iketani (Newsanchor)", "Minoru It\u00f4 (\u00d4tori Astronaut)", "Ralph Jesser (South Pole Base Personnel)", "Sabur\u00f4 Kadowaki (Reporter)", "Kuniyoshi Kashima (South Pole Base Worker)", "Yoshio Katsube (Reporter/Space Station Observer)", "Keiichir\u00f4 Katsumoto (Government Personnel)", "Shigeo Kat\u00f4 (South Pole Base Worker)", "Ikuo Kawamura (\u00d4tori Astronaut)", "Akira Kitch\u00f4ji (Government Personnel)", "Akio Kusama (Government Personnel)", "Edo K\u00een (USSO Representative)", "Somesh\u00f4 Matsumoto (Government Personnel)", "Masahide Matsushita (South Pole Base Worker)", "Jir\u00f4 Mitsuaki (Government Personnel)", "Takashi Narita (Government Personnel)", "Junpei Natsuki (Man at Funeral)", "Yutaka Oka (South Pole Base Worker)", "Keiji Sakakida (Government Personnel)", "Haruya Sakamoto (Reporter)", "Ry\u00f4ji Shimizu (Base Designer)", "Junnosuke Suda (Government Personnel)", "Haruo Suzuki (Reporter)", "Kamayuki Tsubono (Government Personnel)", "Keisuke Yamada (Government Personnel)", "Shin Yoshida (Government Personnel)", "Osman Yusuf (South Pole Base Worker)", "Yasumasa \u00d4nishi (Government Personnel)", "Hideo \u00d4tsuka (Reporter)", "Haruo Nakajima (Maguma)", "K\u00f4ji Suzuki (Pilot of Hayabusa)", "Masaya Nihei (It\u00f4)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "vcn5_hwG694"}
