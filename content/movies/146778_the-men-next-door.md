What he doesn't find out right away is that the two men are, in fact, father and son. And as they say, wackiness ensues.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hyLscM2XZi99vki2RLbLqBnEPBs.jpg", "actors": ["Eric Dean (Doug)", "Michael Nicklin (Jacob)", "Benjamin Lutz (Colton)", "Heidi Rhodes (Evelyn)", "Mark Cirillo (Woody)", "Christopher Schram (Philip)", "Devon Michael Jones (Derek)", "Rachel Alig (Bambi)", "Ronnie Kroell (Darren)", "Christopher Patrino (Christopher)", "Kevin F.
