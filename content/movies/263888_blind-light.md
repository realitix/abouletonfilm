The presence of camera, studio and artist/performer are registered through image and sound, the loss of the former filling out the presence of the latter. In this way the physicality of object, space and subject as well as their inferiority is fleshed out, mapping out a space that is at once material and psychical. Controlling the light she allows into the frame, the artist lifts the blinds or pulls them shut, applies or removes lens filters, opens wide the aperture or closes it. Each performance or action threatens the image as it shifts in and out of \u2018proper\u2019 exposure until it disappears completely. Focusing either on the window or the sky, the artist narrates her camera operation whilst also describing what she sees; intermixing receptive and projective vision.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4qYGZRCDIyNvzZdisolf6fy0s8a.jpg", "actors": ["Sarah Pucill ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
