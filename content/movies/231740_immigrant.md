Daanyik's childhood of pencil drawings and toy soldier battles in Moscow is interrupted overnight as he is hurled into the harsh reality of adulthood in New York City. Upon losing his father Deema, Daanyik and his mother, Meela, are left poor, alone and helpless in a foreign land. Out of desperation for survival, Meela begins a relationship with Tolik, an abusive man that may have had a hand in Deema's death. Daanyik finds himself trapped in a precarious web of torment brought on by his new stepfather, a lecherous Rabbi and a neighborhood bully. Drawing becomes his only source of comfort and catharsis. As his battles grow fiercer, Daanyik, at the tender age of nine, is left to overcome insurmountable odds to save himself and his mother from complete destruction.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4dFd3JzTBaZh3mtPjg7uEttuIle.jpg", "actors": ["Harry Hamlin (Deema)", "Paul Sorvino (Yeshiva Principal)", "Andrew Divoff ()", "Michael Lerner ()", "Angela Gots ()", "Rachael Kathryn Bell ()", "Jake Elliott (Roma)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "zZ_b4NpiIQ0"}
