After waking up and noticing bruises on her body, the woman flashes back to last night\u2019s perilous journey home. But as full memory of the attack she experienced comes back to her, we soon realize our heroine turned the tables in a surprisingly scary way. Fordham\u2019s effective twist on the rape-revenge thriller marks her as a forward-thinking horror maker with a unique perspective in a historically misogynistic genre.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/I0hnId0TZ55C68pIGhrP7zVkXR.jpg", "actors": ["Monica West (Kali)", "Parker Madison (Man)", "Tanner Dahlin (Man 2)", "Alexia Morand (Voice of Kali)", "Jacopo Rampini (Voice of Man)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
