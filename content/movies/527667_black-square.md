This piece of art won worldwide fame as a Manifesto of Suprematism, one of the brightest areas of the Russian avant-garde. Black Square was painted in 1915 as scenery for opera performance. From that moment and for the next 100 years Suprematism defines a new language of art, in its various forms: non-figurative painting, modern architecture, industrial design, fashion, book graphics and scenography. The film is dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the Black Square, the main content of which is energy. A replica of this masterpiece of non-objectiveness is the energy of dance.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Elena Kuzmina ()", "Olga Mandrikova Lanceray ()", "Mikalai Radziush ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
