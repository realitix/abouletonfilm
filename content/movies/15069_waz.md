Tom Shankland's movie is undeniably bleak, but sift through the blood and the grime and you find there's an intelligent film at work, one that opens up an uncomfortable can of worms about human nature. But of course if you like it bloody and mean, then that is served up with relish as well, with all the key scenes packing an emotional whack to go with the jolts.\r\n\r\nBrains to go with the splatter, some very smart photography (Morten S\u00f8borg) and engaging lead performances, these all lift this above average. If only it hadn't cheapened things down with the daft finale then this would have garnered more support in horror circles. 6/10"}], "recommandations_id": [22007, 14459, 9911, 38033], "youtube_key": "ibjhBxn2s1U"}
