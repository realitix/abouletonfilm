Later on, more directors joined and so did actors, actresses and singers. This documentary follows the band members at home, on the set, at rehearsals and during performances. It\u2019s a story of friendship, opposing characters, growing old and ambitions and illusions. Anecdotes and archive films provide a hilarious flashback on the lives of the film friends. Time has treated them well. Everybody is or has been successful. To rough it all up, they decide to write a song that will be played at one of the band member\u2019s funeral.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Ate de Jong (himself)", "Dick Maas (himself)", "Hans Scheepmaker (himself)", "Peter Warnier (himself)", "George Schouten (himself)", "Huub Stapel (himself)", "Esm\u00e9 Lammers (herself)", "Maja van den Broecke (herself)", "Monique Klemann (herself)", "Nouchka van Brakel (herself)", "Leslie Doornik ()", "Dorna van Rouveroy ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
