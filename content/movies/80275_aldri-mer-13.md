After an endurance test to find which of them can lie longer in a circle of flames, they become friends. However, as a result of some unfortunate truths and half-truths, the friendship falters. Rikke feels that Bea has let her down, and resolves to continue the rivalry between them, but now in a less physical, more artful way. In addition we meet Rikke's elder sister Ninni, who has been in England to learn the language, and has had to leave her great love, a man twelve years her senior. The film is also about the problems Rikke encounters in fulfilling the expectations of those around her as she approaches womanhood.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kBAEnXvpxS2UD0GlfP9Re3maJwC.jpg", "actors": ["Sofie Cappelen (Rikke)", "Martine Karlsen (Bea)", "Svein Roger Karlsen (Svend)", "Anne Krigsvoll (Rikke's mother)", "Lene Bragli (Elisabeth)", "Tonje Louise Kj\u00f8lholt (Ninni)", "Arild Kristo (Inspector)", "Neil Clark (Boot)", "Rina Kelly (Ida)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
