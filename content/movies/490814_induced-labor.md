Some enter lotteries, others beg friends and families to invite them. Others still, just sneak in and hope Mr Trump doesn\u2019t notice they are there. But in this raucous comedy, one Egyptian couple come up with a splendid wheeze.

As you might expect, things don\u2019t quite go according to plan\u2026", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/35cmsJCnrwsHCDSYk9wjJ4XjU1z.jpg", "actors": ["Maged El Kedwany (Hessin)", "Horeya Farghaly (Hiba)", "Mai Kassab ()", "Mostafa Khater (Saaid)", "Bayoumi Fouad (Abdel Fattah)", "Abdelrahman Abo Zhra ()", "Sayed Ragab ()", "Ali El-Tayeb ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [462030, 84250, 289510], "youtube_key": "NJyUODINsCg"}
