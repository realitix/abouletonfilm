When he is falsely accused of the murders of some Vietnamese gangsters, Tang flees to his native Hong Kong, followed closely by his wife and small child, a corrupt CIA agent (as if there were anything else), and the remaining Vietnamese gang members out for revenge. The wife and kid get kidnapped, but Tang and a friend kick everyone's ass, with the wife helping out in rather unexpected ways.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rC1RXKdLcPgClnPWO4quxM3TMBV.jpg", "actors": ["Alan Tang (Dennis Kwan Chi Wah)", "Tang Lan Hua (May)", "Kam Hing-Yin (Vietnamese gang boss)", "Chang Yu (Boss Cop)", "Siu Yuk-Lung (Vietnamese gang member)", "Cheung Lin-Ping (Vietnamese gang member)", "Jackson Ng (Vietnamese gang member)", "Clarence Lee Ga-Ho ()", "Mark Cheung Lui ()", "Walter Tso Tat-Wah (Uncle Huan)", "Tony Leung Siu-Hung ()", "Sai Gwa-Pau ()", "Lau Shiu-Gwong ()", "Cheung Bing-Chuen ()", "Christopher Durkin ()", "Arnault Mauoiere ()", "Luk Ying-Hong ()", "Cheung Hei ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
