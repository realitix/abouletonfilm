The devoutly Christian choir grew up in churches strongly allied with Israel. On their first trip to the Holy Land they witness the harsh realities of life under occupation, a nonviolent movement for justice, and an assassination. Our story is a unique view of a crucial human rights conflict. Mixing the excitement of foot-stomping gospel music and creative theater it reveals the power of art to communicate, heal, and give voice to communities living in fear. It is a cultural exchange of immense depth and far-reaching implications, where, during the course of the journey, people's preconceptions are radically changed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iHOaGSswQJ1X8akp7oqtq6bEPuk.jpg", "actors": ["Ramzi Maqdisi (Martin Luther King, Jr.)", "Georgina Asfour (Coretta Scott King)", "Mohammed Al-Basha (Southerner FBI Police)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
