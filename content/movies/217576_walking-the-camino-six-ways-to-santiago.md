The documentary follows six strangers from incredibly diverse walks of life as they attempt to cross an entire country on foot with only a backpack, a pair of boots, and an open mind. Each pilgrim throws themselves heart-and-soul into their physical trek to Santiago de Compostela, and their personal journey to themselves. As you watch, you will learn the rich history of this honored tradition, as well as witness the Camino's remarkable ability to change lives and provide those who choose to walk its paths with a greater sense of self and spiritual knowledge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aC2Z8g3cRy8bzF8PPaIMjKFeAAH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "LqlAGqeIVwk"}
