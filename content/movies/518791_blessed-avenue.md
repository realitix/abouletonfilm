Continuing a practice Satterwhite has developed over several years, the video is laboriously rendered in the animation software Maya, and includes green-screened performances by the artist and other nocturnal misfits. Like an erotic nightmare from the digital imaginary, the video plunges through warped dreamscapes populated by fornicating leather queens and monstrous, naked, tattooed giants. Satterwhite\u2019s otherworld is one of torqued perspective and twisted physics, dazzling in both color and detail. Although too oneiric for any orderly narrative, the piece loosely follows a conveyor belt of sorts as it glides through a series of impossible architectures: from an abyssal atrium where figures hoverboard above a zigzag floor, to a labyrinthine freeway in the heavens, and further on to locales more miraculous still.\"\r -Gavin Brown's enterprise", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dygNAc4drvpqRRhLx6NJgWGva1f.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
