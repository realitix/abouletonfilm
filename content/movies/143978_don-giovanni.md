Mozart\u2019s music, and the words of his great collaborator Da Ponte, are brought to life in Francesca Zambello\u2019s engrossing production with its rich and colourful designs by Maria Bjornson. The music is memorable, dramatic and enjoyable: from the seductive solo voices of the famous \u2018La ci darem la mano\u2019 to the fabulous ensemble as Don Giovanni\u2019s infatuated conquests, vengeful victims and their outraged relatives join forces for justice. And retribution does finally come to Don Giovanni, a serial womanizer and a murderer, with the searing flames of Hell ready to engulf him. Simon Keenlyside heads the outstanding cast at the Covent Garden Royal Opera House, conducted by renowned Mozart expert Charles Mackerras.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rCbXRmknhtVRMgwWUrFqICjUQpV.jpg", "actors": ["Simon Keenlyside (Don Giovanni)", "Kyle Ketelsen (Leporello)", "Marina Poplavskaya (Donna Anna)", "Ram\u00f3n Vargas (Don Ottavio)", "Joyce DiDonato (Donna Elvira)", "Miah Persson (Zerlina)", "Robert Gleadow (Masetto)", "Eric Halfvarson (Commendatore)", "Charles Mackerras (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
