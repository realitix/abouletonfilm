The hussars, mostly ordinary men, have heard news of the uprising and wish to return to the homeland to defend the newly independent country. The Empire, on the other hand, is firmly resolved that all Hungarian troops in the imperial army should be kept as far away from the trouble spot as possible, knowing that most soldiers would be loyal to Budapest rather than Vienna.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kCaH7OPesigJAG2SELGNkV8qzJL.jpg", "actors": ["D\u00f3zsa L\u00e1szl\u00f3 (Pa\u00e1l Farkas kapit\u00e1ny)", "Gy\u00f6rgy Cserhalmi (Csorg\u00e1s Istv\u00e1n)", "J\u00e1cint Juh\u00e1sz (\u00c1cs P\u00e9ter)", "J\u00f3zsef Madaras (Andr\u00e1s Kors\u00f3s)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
