The situation is complicated by the fact that her parents virtually vanished, as did the accident wreckage, so there's no evidence for the police and certainly no closure for her.  Jesse meets her fears head-on when she and a group of filmmakers break into an abandoned mental institution, she immediately experiences a visceral deja-vu. The asylum seems somehow connected to her missing parents and furthermore, the building is far from deserted.  The group discovers that a sinister doctor has taken up residence in the building's vast underground and he is using extreme science trying to bring his wife back from the dead! The basement also contains the countless remains of the doctor's failed experiments, all of which are now slowly coming back to life when they make contact with a murky substance that has begun to leak out of several holding tanks!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/osfApAWUpxPKLDY5A0qCLaJxb0f.jpg", "actors": ["Liane Balaban (Jesse)", "Luis Guzm\u00e1n (Ramone)", "Erin Karpluk (Kelly)", "Erica Cerra (Brit)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "4GiDgB77VyI"}
