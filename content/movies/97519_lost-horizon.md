While escaping war-torn China, a group of Europeans crash in the Himalayas, where they are rescued and taken to the mysterious Valley of the Blue Moon, Shangri-La. Hidden from the rest of the world, Shangri-La is a haven of peace and tranquility for world-weary diplomat Richard Conway. His ambitious brother, George, sees it as a prison from which he must escape, even if it means risking his life and bringing destruction to the ancient culture of Shangri-La.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9xh038mOvedRQs8eblin5eF3JBT.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Finch (Richard Conway)", "Liv Ullmann (Catherine)", "Sally Kellerman (Sally Hughes)", "George Kennedy (Sam Cornelius)", "Michael York (George Conway)", "Olivia Hussey (Maria)", "Bobby Van (Harry Lovett)", "James Shigeta (Brother To-Lenn)", "Charles Boyer (The High Lama)", "John Gielgud (Chang)", "Kent Smith (Bill Fergunson)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [51791, 294825, 72473, 27858], "youtube_key": "w5Xz2zLUoEM"}
