They sneak into hundreds of fur farms. When their images are publicized it causes media feasts and public outrage, year after year. However, the industry always strikes back. Nothing changes.  A new approach is needed.  So, psychologist Frank Nervik tells the fur industry that he plans to become a fur farmer. He asks for training.

Without anybody knowing, he films his training with a hidden camera.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kwpizfcyFhkyfeVXqSVjXhS8bVU.jpg", "actors": ["Odd Harald Eidsmo (Himself)", "Per Arne T\u00f8llefsen (Himself)", "Frank Nervik (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
