His success is, in reality, a product of his marriage to his beautiful, socialite wife, Amanda, (Terri Polo) a wealthy timber heiress. Unlike most, who would remain content to enjoy a life of luxury and privilege, Brooks continues to risk everything by having extramarital affairs. Brooks' philandering, in addition to humiliating Amanda, has driven her to the point of a mental breakdown. Having been pushed over the edge, Amanda orchestrates a just and elaborate plan to bring her husband down. When Brooks leaves for a weekend romp with his latest squeeze, (Agnes Bruckner) his life quickly descends into a bizarre, nightmarish, downward spiral.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hPnTVkqaYyrKt6RFPsemm4HvbQr.jpg", "actors": ["Cary Elwes (Brooks)", "Agnes Bruckner (Heather)", "Teri Polo (Amanda)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [389832, 249109, 360203], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
