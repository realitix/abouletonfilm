As a young man, he certainly knows how to make things happen with women. But as his best friend Krantz would say to him, \"Why do you always ask questions you already know answers to?\". Leo believes firmly in what he invents from one day to the next. Images, impressions, stories fill his head. That's just how he is: life, for Leo, is just a game. Behind this childlike attitude, hides the very essence of his own life's quest.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xlfh3gR0Rnp1yyTNCzLfQNnLFFI.jpg", "actors": ["JR Bourne (Leo)", "Mich\u00e8le-Barbara Pelletier (Shell)", "Cary Lawrence (Lisa)", "Sabine Karsenti (Tamara)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
