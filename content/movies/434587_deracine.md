Together with his homeless pals, he makes his living by selling his paintings on the street. His paintings, dynamically exploding on pieces of cardboard, catch the eyes of Kyoko, an art dealer. He can feel alive only if he keeps painting, but unable to find something to fill his void inside, he tries to drown himself in alcohol. Drawn to Jouji, Kyoko commissions him to paint for her. The two travel to a secluded mountain-side, and there Jouji becomes inspired both by the natural surroundings and Kyoko herself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yqf2C3zUWXoOq9D74dvUHsiMo7N.jpg", "actors": ["Eiji Okuda (Jouji)", "Asuka Kurosawa (Kyoko)", "Aki Kajiwara ()", "Makoto Kaketa ()", "Masashi Kaneko ()", "Akiko Kimura ()", "Houka Kinoshita ()", "T\u00f4ru Masuoka ()", "Chieko Misaka ()", "Noboru Mitani ()", "Miho Miyazawa ()", "R\u00f4 Naruse ()", "Gaku Sait\u00f4 ()", "Satoshi Shinohara ()", "Ken'ichir\u00f4 Tanabe ((as Kenichir\u00f4 Tanabe))", "Yukinari Yanagino ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
