In reality their aim is a quest for absolute freedom, they wish to be as free as animals. The man has dragged the woman into this situation, but the roles are reversed: he is tired and disillusioned, she finds herself carrying the plan forward on her own. This is why she steals a goat and places it before his eyes. Due to his feelings of guilt, the man decides to abandon the organisation, and after being pursued by the police, the house as well. Now they are truly free; but their relationship ends.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
