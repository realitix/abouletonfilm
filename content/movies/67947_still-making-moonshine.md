Riley returns to the mountains of North Carolina and discovers more than just whiskey being bootlegged. Jim Tom smiths a still from a roll of copper at his creek-side camp. In a dry county thick with prying eyes and tee-totalers, Jim Tom slips around making a run of moonshine. Jerry Jumper and William Bird explain how the old spirit allies of the Cherokee, \"the little people\", still live in the near by woods and streams. As a feature length sequel to the critically acclaimed short documentary \"Moonshine\", \"Still Making Moonshine\" is a drunken tale of lost language, severed limbs, buried shine and blackouts. Have a taste of bootleg whiskey and Jesus, \"140 proof.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wUhL2f0VBRoXpqJub64KakTjRFD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
