Boris Godunov is Mussorgsky\u2018s masterpiece and his only complete opera. It\u2018s a vast sprawling tapestry of Russian life, which centres on the Russian people - represented in the opera by a large and powerful chorus - rather than on the title figure. The staging presented on this DVD was produced at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona and is based on the original version of the score", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2ZznGm1ZjUK8bonqPQTCK1FashF.jpg", "actors": ["Matti Salminen ()", "Eric Halfvarson ()", "Anatoli Kotcherga ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
