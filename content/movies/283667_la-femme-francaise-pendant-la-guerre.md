In a city, she works in railway stations,as a waitress or even as a chimney sweep. At the factory, she only interrupts her work to feed her baby. At the country she does the plowing or picks olives. But above all a wife, she brings the soldier \"fraternity and tenderness\", parcels, love notes and care. She brings flowers to the dead's tombs, and remains ever present in the soldier's heart.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Suzanne Bianchetti ()", "Ferdinand Foch (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
