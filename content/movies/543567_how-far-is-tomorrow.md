Officially, the censorship system is designed to promote Confucian morality, political stability and social harmony, which means that features are often removed from reality and didactic in tone. Enter upcoming director Wang Jinsong, whose How Far Tomorrow? is one of the very first Chinese movies to tackle the grim reality of rising recreational drug use head-on. Following in the footsteps of modern classics such as Requiem for a Dream and 21 Grams, the film follows happy wife and mother Yu Lanben, whose life spirals out of control when she stumbles across her town\u2019s seedy underbelly and quickly falls victim to addiction. A blistering critique of China\u2019s public welfare system and the dangerousness of excess, as well as a groundbreaking work of social realism, this is a trailblazing vision from a filmmaker whose star is very much the rise.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jNBbYumGonB3WuEW3QmTyujOhjF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
