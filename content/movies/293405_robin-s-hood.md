She falls for Brooklyn, a White Frenchwoman, who's a thief with dreams of running a motorcycle repair shop. Robin is not only willing to be Brooklyn's lover, she's willing to join in the robberies because she sees community projects that need money: she becomes an anonymous Robin Hood. When her personal life takes a sharp turn and she wants to do one last job, Brooklyn's jealousy flares. Is there any way to resolve these conflicts of love, family, finance, and violence?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h13ZjB6HDBMKJgDKbAw7s8vjxwU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
