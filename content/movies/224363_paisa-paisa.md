He contacts his friend Kishore (Indrajith), an ad filmmaker and his friend, to help him with some money. Kishore, who is in Kochi, has an equally crucial day. His wife Surya (Mamta Mohandas) is returning to his life as the couple has been living separate for some time. Kishore sets aside his plans to reconcile with his wife to help his friend.
