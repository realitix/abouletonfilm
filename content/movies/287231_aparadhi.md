Prem Nazir's performance is something very diffrernt to his usual polished self. He acts as a rough police officer which is a welcome change.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Prem Nazir (Circle Inspector Rajan)", "Madhu (Jayachandran)", "Sheela (Susheela)", "Karan (Raju)", "Jayabharathi (Lissy)", "Prathapa Chandran (Jayachandran's Father)", "Babitha (Annie)", "Bahadoor (Ouseppachan)", "Balan K Nair (Malayi Kunjumon)", "K P Ummer (Johnson)", "Nanditha Bose (Sumathi)", "P K  Abraham (DSP)", "Paravoor Bharathan (Raman Nair)", "Santha Devi ()", "T.
