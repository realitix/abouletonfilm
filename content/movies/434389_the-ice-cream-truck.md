I won't pretend that _The Ice Cream Truck_ will have universal appeal, the understated nature will bore some people, and the ending will aggravate some too. But it doesn't take the directions I was sure it would, and that little surprise is always nice, plus the acting was far better than what you would expect in this kind of indie Horror fare.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"}], "recommandations_id": [384594, 28640, 481192, 24944], "youtube_key": "cakTOMEPr74"}
