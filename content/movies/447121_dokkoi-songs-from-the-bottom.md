Following the method developed in the previous \ufb01lms, the \ufb01lmmakers moved to the slum of Kotobuchi in the port city of Yokohama, where more than 6000 people were struggling to get by without any means of survival, exposed to industrial accidents and diseases. The result is one of the most moving \ufb01lms produced by the collective, a series of beautifully \ufb01lmed portraits, voicing the silenced stories and songs of a group of people living in this community.
