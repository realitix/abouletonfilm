His accountant informs him he has many unpaid bills and little cash on hand. EVA throws a fit and fires him. He then proceeds to play one person off against another, dismiss with cruelty his recent lover Ali, sleep openly with his leading lady Gudrun, and make a direct and public play for his leading man, Walter. He's mercurial, dictatorial, and manic. Will he finish the film, having drawn great performances from his actors through his manipulations, or will his antics set events in motion that spin out of his control?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/trJm7OG7JzCuDKbqxwoO4VmqppR.jpg", "actors": ["Eva Mattes (EVA)", "Lisa Kreuzer (Gudrun / Marguerite)", "Werner Stocker (Walter / Armand)", "Charles Regnier (Yvonne)", "Charles M.
