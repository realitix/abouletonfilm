Given privileged access to both galleries the film documents this landmark exhibition, whilst interweaving Rembrandt\u2019s life story, with behind-the-scenes preparations at these world famous institutions. Exploring many of the exhibition\u2019s key works, through contributions from specially invited guests including curators and leading art historians, this EXHIBITION ON SCREEN favourite makes a welcome return to the big screen marking the 350th anniversary of Rembrandt's death. For many, Rembrandt is the greatest artist that ever lived and this deeply moving film seeks to explore the truth about the man behind the legend.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z8OgGck12W1dVDGOnsUm6H1RhVj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
