Gracefully stepping up to the microphone for the celebrated television event 'The BP Super Show', hosted by musician and entertainer Horrie Dargie, Fitzgerald delivered a mellifluous set of legendary songs in an intimate concert setting at The Embers Nightclub in Toorak Road, South Yarra Victoria. This rarely seen B&W television treat is considered to be one of the earliest audio-visual recordings of the 'First Lady of Song', backed by the smooth sounds of the Lou Levy Quartet. Beside Fitzgerald's performance of 14 memorable Jazz and Blues classics, the program also contains original BP musical interludes and jingles from the Horrie Dargie Quartet.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zd99Nrl2iHxia5H4LpzxgdgzCtB.jpg", "actors": ["Ella Fitzgerald (Herself)", "Horrie Dargie (Himself)", "Lou Levy (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
