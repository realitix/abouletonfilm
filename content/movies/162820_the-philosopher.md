When he wants a new suit for a lecture (actually very minor) about his new book, he meets the sisters Franziska, Breate and Marthe, who run a boutique, share a house and have a lover each. Those invite Georg to dinner, Franziska even on dates. Falling off a boat he gets naked with her, and they become lovers. The girls all take to Hermes and get him to move in, spoiled by all and offered polygamy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zniy5kNidelb0F6et7L35zj4eUA.jpg", "actors": ["Johannes Herrschmann (Georg Hermes)", "Adriana Altaras (Franziska)", "Friederike Tiefenbacher (Beate)", "Claudia Matschulla (Martha)", "J\u00fcrgen Wink ()", "Werner Gerber ()", "Marquard Bohm (Musiker)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
