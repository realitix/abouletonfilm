A dainty deer drinks very loudly and rudely from a lake. A pack rat swaps an egg and an acorn, then back again (\"monotonous, isn't it?\"). A flock of ducks lands; a hunter fires; all fly away, except one with an American flag on its side. A termite fells a huge tree. A cowboy rides across the plains well, no; his horse is just slapping itself with the front hooves. A coyote calls to its mate: \"Hey, Mabel, come on out!\" A camel contradicts the narrator, saying he's really thirsty. A wild dog: because of the lumbermen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aiH2RYdzjoF1aBDz6j593zijlQ8.jpg", "actors": ["Mel Blanc (Deer / Bird / Bob Cat / Mouse / Alligator / Pig / Termite / Coyote / Wild Dog (voice) (uncredited))", "Robert C.
