But it's primarily a poultry farm; as the sign says, \"For sale: Miracle eggs if it's a good egg, it's a miracle.\" A rabbit, doing a Jack Benny impression (Jack Bunny), paints and inspects eggs. He starts to smash and reject a black egg, but it hatches into a black baby bird doing a Rochester impression. We next visit the Eddie Cackler family, (Eddie Cantor) who have been trying without success to have a son; the next five eggs hatch, and they are again all girls. A Bing Crosby lookalike comes by with a stroller full of sons, and Eddie asks for his secret; he demonstrates by crooning to a chick, who lays dozens of eggs with boys names on them. Eddie croons to his wife, but in a higher pitch, then dances out singing the theme song to other caricatures. The egg hatches, but in answer to Eddie's question, is it really a boy? \"Mmmm... could be.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/csmK9mUAYhljzQtMQf1wVtaWjWg.jpg", "actors": ["Mel Blanc (Porky Pig)", "Kent Rogers (Eddie Cackler)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
