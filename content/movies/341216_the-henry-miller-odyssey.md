Miller generously reveals how he saw his era, his peers and himself. He recalls his painful youth and his struggle to survive as a writer; talks about art, dreams, and the allure of Paris; reads passages from his works and enjoys himself with friends, including Lawrence Durrell, Anais Nin, Alfred Perles, Brassai, and Jakov Gimpel. What emerges in this insightful documentary is Miller's charm, his gentleness and his lust for life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uWEvdeJdJPQIJ3HC5BoOnzzpDpm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
