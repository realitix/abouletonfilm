Yet scientists now believe they could hold the key to answering the ultimate question - what was there before the Big Bang?  The trouble is that researching them is next to impossible. Black holes are by definition invisible and there's no scientific theory able to explain them.  Despite these obvious obstacles, Horizon meets the astronomers attempting to image a black hole for the very first time and the theoretical physicists getting ever closer to unlocking their mysteries.  It's a story that takes us into the heart of a black hole and to the very edge of what we think we know about the universe.
