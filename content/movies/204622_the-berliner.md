In Berliner Ballade, Froebe makes his screen debut as Otto, a feckless Everyman who tries to adjust to the postwar travails of his defeated nation. Stymied by black-market profiteers and government bureaucrats, Otto begins fantasizing about a happier life at the end of that ever-elusive rainbow. Director R. A. Stemmle doesn't have to strive for pathos: he merely places his gangly star amidst the ruins of a bombed-out Berlin, and the point is made for him. Filmed in 1948, Berliner Ballade was later released in the U.S. as The Berliner.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4gtGHq6M0L6gkdPyq5otneOcgfe.jpg", "actors": ["Gert Fr\u00f6be (Otto Normalverbraucher)", "Tatjana Sais (Ida Holle)", "O.E.
