Since 1466, these women have been written about in history as men because no one would believe how skilled they were at violence. Unknown to most of their prey, the Lost Girls are far from human. They are mysteriously immortal -- but not invincible. When their leader, Gracie, begins dying, that balance is thrown into jeopardy and the Lost Girls must stop an erupting vampire revolution, race to find a cure and conquer their own personal demons before it is too late.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1wUm3Y4j4nZ4dS3wz2dYkXt5io8.jpg", "actors": ["Eliza Swenson (Gracie)", "Martin Ewens (Ruthven)", "Alexandra Turshen (Sadie)", "Ramona Mallory (Carmilla / The Scarlet Sorceress)", "John Wells (Dimitri)", "Robin Rose Singer (Trixie)", "Brandon Stacy (Malachy)", "Russell Saylor (Lao)", "Ken Burmeister (Bulldog)", "Sasha Jackson (Bathory)", "Dominique Swain (Lucy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "lEtg8M3HBe0"}
