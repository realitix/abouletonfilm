Ten years earlier, in 1999, they had spent months in a logging camp in a mountain range of western Burma. They go back to the same camp to find out whether the elephants they had filmed back in 1999 would still be there. After Burma, the photographers travel in three other Asian countries to determine how different cultures influence the fate of the animals and their future.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
