The heroine (Kristine Soderbaum) is a na\u00efve farm girl who wants nothing more out of life than to visit the \"Golden City\" of Prague. Once arrived, she quickly falls into a bad crowd. She is ultimately disowned by her father and abandoned by her beau. Distinctly xenophobic in tone, Die Goldene Stadt doesn't stand the test of time too well. Lensed in Agfacolor, the film was based on Der Gigant, a play by Richard Billinger.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qXlYxjIpOqiIDmLVXY5yfb7Drq9.jpg", "actors": ["Kristina S\u00f6derbaum (Anna Jobst)", "Eugen Kl\u00f6pfer (Melchior Jobst)", "Annie Rosar (Annas Tante)", "Paul Klinger (Ingenieur Leitwein)", "Kurt Meisel (Toni)", "Rudolf Prack (Thomas)", "Dagny Servaes ()", "Liselotte Schreiner ()", "Hans Hermann Schaufu\u00df ()", "Frida Richard ()", "Ernst Legal ()", "Walter Lieck ()", "Valy Arnheim ()", "Maria Hofen ()", "Else Ehser ()", "Josef Reithofer (Bauer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
