Now 14, Max is about to decide on an internship and is finding it difficult to choose. He settles, against his mother's wishes, for a bank internship. But mother Agnethe, still quite embarrassing, takes action and enrols Max in a free spirited camp for the sake of his soul's salvation. Meanwhile his lovelife is hanging by a thread; Esther seems less and less interested in him even though he is making an effort to win her over. The Max universe is based on a perpetual idea that children are afraid to appear embarrassed as they evolve into maturity. Likewise, it seems that their parents also become embarrassed when they make attempts to protect their children or express their love for them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/16pXK3FZ79izuv9se3KTS3ZMQ4N.jpg", "actors": ["Mette Agnete Horn (Mor)", "Louise Mieritz (Ulla)", "Samuel Heller-Seiffert (Max)", "Lars Bom (Steen Cold)", "Anders Hove (Mogens)", "Michelle Bj\u00f8rn-Andersen ()", "Henrik Lykkegaard ()", "Faysal Mobahriz ()", "Anna Agafia Svideniouk Egholm ()", "Luca d'Apuzzo Poulsen ()", "Niels-Martin Eriksen ()", "Camille Rommedahl ()", "Malika Ferot ()", "Katja Holm ()", "Louise Wulff ()", "Reimer Bo ()", "Signe Wenneberg ()", "Nikolaj Koppel ()", "Henrik Vesterberg ()", "Jalal Fallah ()", "Denise Alvine Wencke Gjern\u00f8e ()", "Jens Ehrenreich ()", "Jan Jensen ()", "Kasper Birch ()", "Ulla Kj\u00e6r Christensen ()", "Jette Rander Mortensen ()", "Tanja Siri Corbo ()", "Pauline Poulsen ()", "Agnes Pugflod ()", "Karl Thorgaard ()", "Per Andreasen ()", "Anders Brink Madsen ()", "Trine W\u00f8rs ()", "Jan Pirouz ()", "Palle S\u00f8rensen ()", "Birgit S\u00f8rensen ()", "Anita Heller ()", "Dragana Miliutinovic ()", "Ester Seifert ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
