Here he seems primarily interested in showing the painful, stunted lives of Hungary's intellectuals, who are shown as remaining silent and ineffectual during various political crises. There are several action sequences involving chases and shootouts, but since there's no clear narrative we're not sure how they relate to each other or to anything else. The film is, however, visually fascinating, with shots of police cars, horses, and naked bodies juxtaposed and extensive use of multiple video imagery.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bwSLN9BkW1gBSMgpDRyAjiqHBGa.jpg", "actors": ["Juli B\u00e1sti (Juli)", "Gy\u00f6rgy Cserhalmi (Jozef K.)", "Ildik\u00f3 B\u00e1ns\u00e1gi (M\u00e1rta)", "Dorottya Udvaros (Kata)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
