The men, despite the efforts of their wives to stop them, spend all their  time in the village\u2019s bar, spending their last money on alcohol and sex. Chaos overcomes the village school; its  devotees abandon the mosque. Only two youngsters benefit from all this mayhem, by realizing their love affair,  forbidden by their parents. At the end, the women start upraising. Consequently, the bar is burnt down and the  village looks that it will return to normality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/KiSyHT7DUkIo5i0TJ7xwcj5fAC.jpg", "actors": ["Adriana Matoshi (Luljeta)", "Salaetin Bilal (Basri)", "Ndri\u00e7im Xhepa (The School Principle)", "Luan Jaha (The Mayor)", "Shkumbin Istrefi (Xhinga)", "Amernis Noksiki ()", "Osman Ahmeti (The Imam)", "Vjolca Bekteshi (Hana)", "Diana Spasova (Bulgarian Woman)", "Ismet Ramadani (Mursel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "2x0gendGoJY"}
