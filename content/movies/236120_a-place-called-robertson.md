Old timer farmers rub shoulders with newcomer creative people which include some of Australia's most famous artists and composers seeking a tree change. They discover in Robertson there is more than just trees. Above all, the residents of Robertson want to retain their town as a rural village. Collectively the community, old and new, vigorously fight against the invasion of the outside world, threats of a large jail, bores which deplete the aquifers and coal seam gas mining. In a contemporary world that sometimes questions the advantages of social media technology, A Place Called Robertson is a snapshot of traditional Australian values, a magical film, celebrating the spirit that can be found in a small Australian rural village.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kcnuvVsMM6ncLLV38erxjYD9R6a.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "OFRpu2mhtp4"}
