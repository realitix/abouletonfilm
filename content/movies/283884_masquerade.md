The film is mood-filled: A duel scene in a snowy forest, obviously the morning after a masquerade ball. Harlequin lies dying, while Red Indian walks away with the wings of victory. The woman between them appears, cat-masked. The mask dissolves away. Her spirit passes into the face of the sun upon the sun upon the sun flower. But Harlequin cannot escape death. The blue world engulfs him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k4oOdA17vMgbWbhwRgm7Dzq1SFH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
