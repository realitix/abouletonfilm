It moves from rural prostitution (the roadhouse) to pornographers, then on to streetwalkers, male hustlers, and high-class call girls. The madam runs the bordello, she depends on the photographer to supply her with pornography; he's in the city, using his camera to lead him into depravity. The streetwalkers risk arrest from the cops and abuse from the johns. Even the call girls have a tough time: from their expenses to their lack of self-reflection. Their motto: \"Live fast, die young, and make a beautiful corpse.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vHHKvFWwgM2Ggiy2PmyQ48QnYBQ.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Findlay (Partygoer / Call Girl's Client / Voices)", "Roberta Findlay (Prostitute / Street Girl / Call Girl / Voices)", "Jean Reynolds (Prostitute)", "Cindy Freemont (Stripper)", "Janet Banzet (Lesbian Model)", "Sheila Britt (Lesbian Model)", "Ron Skideri (Male Hustler)", "Lem Amero (Narrator / Photographer / Male Hustler's Girlfriend)", "Rita Bennett (Call Girl (uncredited))", "John Amero (Interviewer (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
