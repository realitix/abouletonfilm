It seems Akira is there to pick up Ito Kaori, whom he has known since Kaori was a child, so that she can join his and Maria's clan... of ageless vampires! But before Akira can get to the rendezvous point, the one-time doctor is distracted by a woman making a suicide attempt.

When one of the police detectives on the case, Saeki Shoji, starts digging into Kaori's death, the links he finds all seem to lead straight to Akira and Maria. So now the pair decide their best course of action is to try and track down the serial killer themselves as soon as possible...", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u8a4oOOlhR57jJqeK8gn1QvACaN.jpg", "actors": ["Shingo Katori (Misugi Akira)", "Ayami Nakajo (Maria)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
