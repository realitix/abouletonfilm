Highlighting the links between being sexually abused as a child, loss of self-esteem, and turning to the streets, the film quickly dispels the images of glamor and big money usually associated with prostitution, and shows the positive efforts of child-care workers to help juvenile prostitutes find a way out.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ni9eV3fUwZkMbO01aguGaqDTwux.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
