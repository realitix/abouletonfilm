Vilom, a friend to both and interested in Mallika, is a passive onlooker for the first two acts. Kalidasa leaves his verdant mountain valley home for the splendour of far off Ujjain, where he wins fame. The action of the film is rooted in the village to which Kalidasa returns years later and finds Mallika married to Vilom and the mother of his child. Mallika sacrificed her love so that the poet could pursue his muse.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ff75cV7myHVXxKg8f9cP35uVvnb.jpg", "actors": ["Aruna Irani ()", "Arun Khopkar (Kalidasa)", "Rekha Sabnis (Mallika)", "Om Shivpuri (Vilom)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
