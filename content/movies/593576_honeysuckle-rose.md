But when Kate blows their savings by buying a race horse named Honeysuckle Rose which doesn't win, it puts a mean strain on their marriage. They begin to fight and eventually seek solace in the arms of others in a series of torrid extramarital affairs. And then Honeysuckle Rose unexpectedly starts to win and their fortunes change. Now they're rolling in dough and can debauch together as a couple. Samantha Strong and John Holmes star as the wayward couple, and the legendary Mr. Holmes is, as always, a spectacle to watch while in action if not while acting.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/umjhFGYSRKw6FfZjflzJoYsEbzF.jpg", "actors": ["John Holmes (Sam Loomis)", "Serena (Farmer Hanley's Daughter)", "Samantha Fox (Manicurist)", "Marcia Minor ()", "Rikki O'Neal (Kate)", "Herschel Savage (Ben)", "Ron Hudd (Encounter Group Guy)", "Erica Havens (Alice)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
