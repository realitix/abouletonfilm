This incredibly elaborate (and surprisingly little-known) film traces the origins of Quilombo, which began as a community of freed slaves. The colony becomes a safe harbor for other outcasts of the world, including Indians and Jews. Ganga Zumba (Toni Tornado) becomes president of Quilombo, the first freely elected leader in the Western Hemisphere. Naturally, the ruling Portuguese want to subjugate Zumba and his followers, but the Quilombians are ready for their would-be oppressors. The end of this Brave New World is not pleasant, but the followers of Zumba and his ideals take to the hills, where they honor his memory to this day. Writer/director Carlos Diegues takes every available opportunity to compare the rise and fall of Quilombo with the state of affairs in modern-day Brazil.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dFPgPTqrxmGCJ5aXij5h6bkwydq.jpg", "actors": ["Tony Tornado (Ganga Zumba)", "Ant\u00f4nio Pomp\u00eao (Zumbi)", "Zez\u00e9 Motta (Dandara)", "Mauricio do Valle (Domingos Jorge Velho)", "Grande Otelo (Bab\u00e1)", "Z\u00f3zimo Bulbul (Stone Man)", "Milton Gon\u00e7alves ()", "Daniel Filho (Fern\u00e3o Carrilho)", "Vera Fischer (Ana de Ferro)", "Carlos Kroeber (Tourinho)", "Ant\u00f4nio Pitanga (Acaiuba)", "Ruy Polanah (Navarro)", "Jofre Soares (Canind\u00e9)", "Thelma Reston (Mrs. Ol\u00edmpia)", "Kim Negro (Man of Corn)", "Chico Diaz (Anuncia\u00e7\u00e3o)", "L\u00e9a Garcia ()", "Emmanuel Cavalcanti (Lins)", "Ben\u00e9 Batista (Ibualama / Xang\u00f4)", "Jonas Bloch (Samuel)", "Ardu\u00edno Colassanti (Blaer)", "Jorge Coutinho (Sal\u00e9)", "Baba\u00fa da Mangueira ()", "Roberto de Cleto (Father Mello)", "Aniceto do Imp\u00e9rio ()", "Sabrina Fidalgo ()", "Jorge Fino (Iabu)", "Thiago Justino (Tit\u00e9)", "Markus Konk\u00e1 (Katambo)", "Carlos Lagoe\u00edro (Andr\u00e9 Tourunho)", "Swami Leeladahar (Bernardo)", "Wilson Macal\u00e9 (Cabinda / Xang\u00f4)", "Eduardo Machado ()", "Sergio Maia (Teodoro (as S\u00e9rgio Maia))", "Scarlet Moon ()", "Luis Motta (Bezerra)", "Sandro Solviatti (Capit\u00e3o-do-mato)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
