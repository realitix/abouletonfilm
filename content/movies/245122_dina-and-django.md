Since Dina only has her grandmother, she spends her time fantasizing about her life and reading comic-book love stories -- activities that do nothing to improve her dim perspective of reality. Due to these handicaps and her own inexperience, she gets involved with Django (Luis Lucas), a shady character who decides to use her as bait to attract men and then rob them. One day when both are in a taxi with robbery in mind, the driver gets suspicious so Django shoots him, and so does Dina. She escapes and runs away -- though it seems like she has learned too little too late. This story unfolds against a time of upheaval in Portugal (mid-1970s) when the military government is formulating a constitution and social changes are happening everywhere.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5du2XdJbzFHfRGNAupxrbQ6bKny.jpg", "actors": ["Mar\u00eda Santiago (Dina)", "Lu\u00eds Lucas (Django)", "Benvinda Bento (Ana - Dina's Grandmother)", "Sinde Filipe (Dina's boss)", "Manuela de Freitas (Dina's boss)", "Manuela Fernandes (Dina's friend)", "Jo\u00e3o Perry (The bosses' friend)", "Tony Morgon (Panther - Bar Owner)", "Ruy Furtado (Pawnbroker)", "Canto e Castro (Man in the bus)", "Geny Frias (Pawnbroker's wife)", "Jo\u00e3o Carlos (Boss's child)", "Margarida Carpinteiro (Dina's teacher)", "Ant\u00f3nio Montez (Taxi Driver)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
