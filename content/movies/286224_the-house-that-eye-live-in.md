But as this intimate film reveals, his work is suffused with the trauma of migration, and the struggle to recognise himself as a \u2018new Australian'. In conversation with documentarian Steven McIntyre, Dirk guides us through more than 40 years of his filmmaking: the early years exploring technique and technology, a subsequent phase of unflinching self-examination brought on by upheaval and overseas travel, and more recent projects where he attempts a fusion of personal, cultural, and historical identity. What emerges is an inspiring, rugged, and at times poignant portrait of an artist committed to self-expression and self-discovery through the medium of film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4ZS97mBSPYLnOqVkIXfHr3abrnL.jpg", "actors": ["Dirk de Bruyn (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
