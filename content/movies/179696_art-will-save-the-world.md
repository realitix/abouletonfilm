The soul of The Auteurs and Black Box Recorder reconstructs the purgatory of his career in a hilarious testimony that craps on every aspect of the pop music business. Those on the prowl for public relations and commercial potential have come to the wrong place. Haines is a notorious party-pooper, a wet blanket at awards ceremonies, and a sourpuss-that-sulks-in-the-corner. To relate his tragic-comic saga, director Niall McCann organizes a perfidious puzzle filled with talking heads: Jarvis Cocker, Stewart Home, David Peace\u2026 (or, as Haines puts it: \u201cpeople who pretend they have met me\u201d), unforgettable quips by the disgusted composer (\u201cTo hell with the common people\u201d, \u201cBritpop never existed\u201d), and a script that resembles Winterbottom gone punk: actors that aspire to walk in Haines\u2019 shoes, frozen images, surprising turns, and historical tiffs.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Luke Haines (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "A3H61oDvflc"}
