The film charts his search for knowledge and understanding, during a decline in his family's circumstances, that leads him to revelations on the nature of art, beauty and politics. However his personal renaissance makes him feel unwelcome in his own country, and forces him to make a choice between exile as artist or staying and facing personal defeat.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1qEln2nz34zHTHwcYIlMbdbMABo.jpg", "actors": ["Bosco Hogan (Stephen Dedalus)", "T.
