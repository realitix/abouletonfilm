While based relatively closely on historical characters and events, the opera\u2019s central scene is fictional: the highly emotional meeting of the queens that concludes the first act (originally invented by Schiller) never took place. It\u2019s a dramatic device that brilliantly highlights the two women\u2019s contrasting characters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k4hUILtzmb7rzzechdanTYQEIPy.jpg", "actors": ["Sonia Ganassi (Elisabetta)", "Joseph Calleja (Leicester)", "Riccardo Zanellato (Talbot)", "Marzio Giossi (Lord Cecil)", "Cinzia Rizzoni (Anna Kennedy)", "Cinzia Rizzoni (Anna Kennedy)", "Carmela Remigio (Maria Stuarda)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
