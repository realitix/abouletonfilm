Posing as Dimitris Christoforidis, journalist for the Golden Jerusalem magazine, he fights for truth, justice and the Greco-Christian ideal. In the dark of the night, the city's worst nightmare returns. Captain F.ROM is back, determined to meet his long-awaited goal: claiming his true name. A name he's entitled to. A name that becomes him. The two protagonists are drawn into a conflict that toys with the viewer's patience until the very climax of the film, in an archetypal battle between good and evil.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5q5ixRMtG3C5jDuV8eGge27tNxU.jpg", "actors": ["Dimitrios Vainas (Super Demetrios)", "Paris Papadopoulos (Captain F.ROM.)", "Olga Sfetsa (Maria Magdalo)", "Tasos Masias (Tsoko)", "Spyros Papanaoum (Not Tsoko, The Other Guy)", "Alexandros Stogiannis (Mayor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
