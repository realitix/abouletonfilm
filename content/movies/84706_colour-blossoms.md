The two cavort in a luxurious apartment owned by an elegant upper-crust Japanese lady (Japanese diva Matsusaka Keiko), crossing paths with an infatuated policeman (Carl Ng), a mysterious Korean woman (Korean transsexual Ha Ri Su), and an increasingly tangled web of violence, criss-crossing passions, and lurid, unchecked desires.
