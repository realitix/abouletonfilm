This was first released to theaters in a soft-core version titled Heads or Tails. In the mid 70s to capitalize on the rise in popularity of hardcore, the original film was hacked up to make room for more explicit sex inserts. This X version is titled Honey Buns and is currently the only version commercially available.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v9tld2t1BMMfQcbxUv3paZ94h6f.jpg", "actors": ["Matt Hewitt (Harry)", "Uschi Digard (Yolanda Wainwright)", "Rene Bond (Marsha Day)", "Starlyn Simone (Right-Guard)", "John Barnum (Mr. Bennett)", "Becky Sharpe (Do-It)", "Sandy Carey (Delicious)", "Kathy Hilton (Show-Me)", "Joan Devlon (Carol (X version only) (uncredited))", "John Seeman (Mr. Wilcox (X version only) (uncredited))", "Monique Cardin (Secretary (X version only) (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
