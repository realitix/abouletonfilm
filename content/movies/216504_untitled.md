The result is a short yet intense piece of contemporary aesthetics. Devoted mainly to density and omission, it visualizes the cinematic narrative on all its levels as a cinematographic and aesthetic mise en sc\u00e8ne. Simultaneously, it reveals that a resolving adaptation of traditional cinematic forms can also create suspense, excitement and pleasure.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e5VPN53gNwJWs2HBJx3qOwXA60r.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
