They perform rituals that we fail to understand. When daylight comes, it only remains fragments.\r 'Until the Sacrifice of Giants' is a documentary fable about the disappearance of myths in contemporary society, through the observation of popular rites. The ritual is here treated as a fiction, a frame within which we are witnessing the end of an imaginary civilization. The viewer becomes the partner of the scientist who tries to understand through analysis of fragments and ruins.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9iqMiZiQVXogr8nCamBf2aOlGk2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
