No one is bad, but all acting for his own benefit and without measure if their actions hurt others. The former Sergeant Diogenes Hernandez owns the Universal, a precarious detective agency private in the Centre of Bogot\u00e1, which is based in the same apartment where he and his wife Fabiola inhabit. His nephew, Clemente Fern\u00e1ndez, who works at the Agency, maintains a romance with Fabiola, without trying to hurt the feelings of his uncle, but driven by the need to alleviate their empty urban and anonymous man.
