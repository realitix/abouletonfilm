Archival footage and interviews provide an in-depth exploration of events ranging from the Kennedy assassinations to the Jonestown massacre, and all that lies between. The footprints left in this archival footage reveal the coordinated, clandestine sculpting of the America we know today. Evidence of Revision proves once and for all that history has been revised even as it was written!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bSGiASBuCfPfDuPXz5CC1Nf73Bh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "TvQ09umh2IM"}
