It covers eight of the thirty-four cantos in Dante Alighieri's Inferno, part of his 14th century epic poem The Divine Comedy. The eight cantos of the film are not conventionally dramatised, rather they are illuminated with layered and juxtaposed imagery while the text is read entirely in \"talking head\" fashion, and punctuated with a kaleidoscopic blend of both newly shot and archival footage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9cqOTFXznmNU2Nc3WxiRdalwi8z.jpg", "actors": ["John Gielgud (Virgil)", "Joanne Whalley (Beatrice)", "Bob Peck (Dante)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
