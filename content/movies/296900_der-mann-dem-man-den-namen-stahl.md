Since his personal documents are also in the wallet, this isn't just a problem of stolen money, but also of identity theft.  The thief, who took his wallet, happens to be a master forger and con man, who uses the papers \"in good faith\" to settle some shady dealings.  When a warrant is issued for his(?) arrest, both men are pursued and both of them end up in the justice system's net.  The victim is dragged through a series of absurd, burocratic procedures to try and re-establish his identity.  And with every new bureaucrat he meets, it only becomes more entangled and more absurd.  Some thing never change, huh?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Axel von Ambesser (Fridolin Beidermann)", "Gretl Sch\u00f6rg (Madame Marlen, Singer)", "Paul Henckels (Dr. Heimlich)", "Elisabeth Flickenschildt (Hella)", "Hubert von Meyerinck (Max Vieregg)", "Aribert W\u00e4scher (Polizeikommiss\u00e4r)", "Hans Hermann Schaufu\u00df (Standesbeamter)", "Leopold von Ledebur (Sauer sr.)", "Maria Litto ()", "Hellmuth Passarge ()", "\u00c4nne Bruck ()", "Klaus Pohl (Portier)", "Luis Rainer ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
