A hand-held camera frames parts of sculptures, or moves across their surfaces, sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly, almost always in close-up. The soundtrack, in addition to the voice, is discordant music. Light and shadows are paramount. Sometimes the camera repeats up and down movements; once, a set of jump cuts brings an object closer. The music can be shrill in contrast to the sculptures. Almost entirely of wood, they are the work of Isamu Noguchi (1904-1988): abstract, usually smooth and rounded, but not always.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k8wX4wn8IZRyxiwx0y7oexhfYfq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
