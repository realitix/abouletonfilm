Galleo takes advantage of the situation by using it in a blackmail scheme against Arthur, which is shaky, at best, as Olive refuses to stay dead.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oyvadxYVyzuN6AMuLmQAgJMu5Wr.jpg", "actors": ["George Brent (Arthur Earthleigh)", "Virginia Mayo (Deborah Tyler)", "Ann Dvorak (Olive Jensen)", "Carole Landis (Mae Earthleigh)", "Elizabeth Patterson (Miss Spring)", "Turhan Bey (David Gelleo)", "Richard Lane (Detective Noonan)", "Julia Dean (Miss Ritchie)", "Charles Smith (Elevator Operator)", "Paul Harvey (Mr. Holliston)", "Hadda Brooks (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
