This is a live recording of a performance at Paris Garnier in 2007. Petit's earlier production for the Ballet de Marseille used more realistic stage sets, but the current Paris version has minimal stage sets. Also, the costumes were redesigned. Roland Petit created a ballet based on \"In Search of Lost Time\" for the Ballet de Marseille in the 1970s. Petit's intention was not to make a faithful adaptation of the novel, but to capture its flavour and convey, through a number of selected scenes, the narrator's incessant fluctuations between happiness and torment. The highlights are the series of poetical pas de deux.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tApMHAq9p6YEKZOEjuYDHktJlRG.jpg", "actors": ["Ballet de L'Op\u00e9ra national de Paris ()", "Koen Kessels ()", "Eleonora Abbagnato (Albertine)", "Herv\u00e9 Moreau (Proust jeune)", "St\u00e9phane Bullion (Morel)", "Manuel Legris (Monsieur de Charlus)", "Mathieu Ganio (Saint-Loup)", "St\u00e9phanie Romberg (Madame Verdurin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
