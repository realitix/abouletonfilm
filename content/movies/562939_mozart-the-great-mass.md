The Great Mass is one of the most impressive works of this important neoclassical Choreographer - a truly impressive requiem; a choreographic revelation. The full length Choreography takes its name from Mozart's famous unfinished Mass in C minor and adds other works by the same composer, such as the Adagio and Fugue in C minor and the motet Ave verum corpus as well as passages of Gregorian chant, and sequences from contemporary music by Gy\u00f6rgy Kurt\u00e1g, Thomas Jahn and Arvo P\u00e4rt. The Leipzig Ballet is regarded as one of the best ballet companies worldwide.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/igjE7fWvSX1dnOQ89were6UbgAK.jpg", "actors": ["Kiyoko Kimura ()", "Oksana Kulchytska ()", "Sibylle Naundorf ()", "Christoph B\u00f6hm ()", "Giovanni di Palma ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
