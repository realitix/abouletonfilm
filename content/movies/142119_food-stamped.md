Nutrition educator Shira Potash teaches nutrition-based cooking classes to elementary school students in low-income neighborhoods, most of whom are eligible for food stamps. In an attempt to walk a mile in their shoes, Shira and her documentary filmmaker husband embark on the food stamp challenge where they eat on roughly one dollar per meal. Along the way, they consult with food justice activists, nutrition experts, politicians, and ordinary people living on food stamps, all in order to take a deep look at the struggles low-income Americans face every day while trying to put three-square meals on the table.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l3zGJzAKVFYHsRXa9qaG8IDwtk9.jpg", "actors": ["Shira Potash (Herself)", "Yoav Potash (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
