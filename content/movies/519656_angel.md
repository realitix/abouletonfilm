He is walking to the exit when Robert del Naja, Andrew Vowles and Horace Andy appear behind Marshall. They gradually get closer to Marshall, causing him to feel intimidated. More people start following him, which causes him to run outside the car park until he reaches a fence and therefore cannot go any further. As he turns to face the people chasing him, they stop and face him. He then notices that they seem to be mirroring his movements, as if his body controls them. He suddenly charges towards the people that followed him, which causes them to run away.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yJV70fdJKWggyJFMMCOtK414TuB.jpg", "actors": ["Massive Attack (Themselves)", "Robert del Naja (Himself)", "Grant Marshall (Himself)", "Horace Andy (Himself)", "Andrew Vowles (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "hbe3CQamF8k"}
