At its dark heart is Hiker Meat, an archetypal 1970s slasher movie imagined by Shovlin, complete with hitchhiking heroine, charismatic commune leader and a group of teens who disappear one by one.  This tantalising film-within-a-film serves to both deconstruct and pay affectionate homage to the often-maligned exploitation style.  Having created a full screenplay, score and cut-and-paste prototype for Hiker Meat, Shovlin filmed key sections and a full trailer in an intense shoot in the Lake District in summer 2013. Rough Cut contrasts these re-made sequences with on-set footage and insights into the development of Hiker Meat\u2019s script, soundtrack and design, to create a compelling mash-up of self-referencing processes, behind-the-scenes viewpoints and time-honoured slasher tropes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/myXwDOZFB6raSc9YEkO0lpz5nU1.jpg", "actors": ["Agnes Aspen ()", "Ashley Houston ()", "Jack Dearsley ()", "Bob Young ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "XebnuKGQ-7Y"}
