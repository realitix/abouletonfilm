S. Van Dine, hadn't been seen on screen for seven years when PRC decided to launch a new \"Philo Vance\" series in 1947. William Wright plays the title role in the first entry, Philo Vance Returns, while Alan Curtis would take over the role for the remaining two films. This time around, Vance investigates the murder of a much-married playboy. With so many of the victim's former wives and sweethearts still around and about, Vance has quite a selection of suspects to choose from.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pb4dOoBLfR0zDmyUNCmom3bQ3nd.jpg", "actors": ["William Wright (Philo Vance)", "Vivian Austin (Lorena Blendon Simms (as Terry Austin))", "Leon Belasco (Alexis Karnoff)", "Clara Blandick (Stella Blendon)", "Ramsay Ames (Virginia Berneaux)", "Damian O'Flynn (Larry Blendon)", "Frank Wilcox (George Hullman)", "Iris Adrian (Maggie McCarthy, aka Choo-choo Divine)", "Ann Staunton (Helen Varney Blendon)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
