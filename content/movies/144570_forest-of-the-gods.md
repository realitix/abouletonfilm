'The Professor' is a man who lives by his own personal version of the Ten Commandments. After miraculously surviving imprisonment in a Nazi concentration camp through a bit of ironic fate, he writes a memoir of his life, which becomes the target of the Soviet censors. The so-called \"freedom\" of Communism becomes just as oppressive as the German concentration camp.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1Qb3J9PKsffHlgsA9qO5VgXQVxL.jpg", "actors": ["Valentinas Masalskis (Professor)", "Steven Berkoff (Commandant Hoppe)", "Robertas Urbonas (Martin Heidel)", "Liubomiras Laucevicius (Wacek Kazlowski)", "Irmantas Jankaitis (Germinski)", "Darius Miniotas (Franc Bloy)", "Dainius Svobonas (Zagorski)", "Migle Grakauskaite (Professor's daughter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
