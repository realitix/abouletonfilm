The story line of this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through the movie. Mel Gibson does a really good job with the accent and plays a great role as William Wallace in the movie.\r\n\r\nI cant help by want to stand up and shout FREEDOM! once the movie is finished. Could watched this movie another 1000 times and not get board of watching it. It's a must watch for any one who has not see it yet."}], "recommandations_id": [2024, 89, 941, 9802], "youtube_key": "nMft5QDOHek"}
