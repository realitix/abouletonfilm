Sa nomination au poste de premier ministre britannique fut un grand hasard, bien qu'il ait re\u00e7u de vives critiques sur sa politique anti-Hitler ; ses discours, qui firent la une des journaux de l'\u00e9poque, r\u00e9sonnent jusqu'\u00e0 aujourd'hui.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8QMXIvdzyWh6HUKbKZ7xYceBAME.jpg", "actors": ["Gary Oldman (Winston Churchill)", "Kristin Scott Thomas (Clementine Churchill)", "Lily James (Elizabeth Layton)", "Stephen Dillane (Edward Wood, 3rd Viscount Halifax)", "Ronald Pickup (Neville Chamberlain)", "Ben Mendelsohn (George VI)", "Nicholas Jones (John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon)", "Samuel West (Anthony Eden)", "David Schofield (Clement Atlee)", "Richard Lumsden (Major-General Hastings Ismay)", "Malcolm Storry (General Sir Edmund Ironside)", "Hilton McRae (Arthur Greenwood)", "Benjamin Whitrow (Sir Samuel Hoare)", "Joe Armstrong (John Evans)", "Adrian Rawlins (Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding)", "David Bamber (Vice-Admiral Bertram Ramsay)", "David Strathairn (Franklin D.

Churchill with Brian Cox in the lead role is a FAR superior film on the subject."}, {"pseudo": "Gimly", "content": "As with many of the biopics I've seen recently, _Darkest Hour_ is more focussed on delivering you the facts than getting you involved with the characters. It is an interesting idea to have the majority of the story revolve around the of whether or not to sue for peace. That as a core concept in so much as the question of \"Do I take the guarantee of saving my country or do I take the risk of saving the world?\" and beyond that \"Is there even a right answer to that question? And who am I to decide something this big?\" is a great philosophical centre for a movie. But I never felt like I knew why any of these people had the answers that they gave. I get that in a historical context, these aren't characters they are real life people, so they answers they had are the answers we see, but again, we are only given the _what_, not the _why_.\r\n\r\nExcept you can throw all of that away because here comes Gary Oldman in his Oscar nominated transformation to make this movie 100% worth watching.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"}], "recommandations_id": [446354, 400617, 359940, 389015]}
