Men who belonged to civic or veterans' clubs gathered together late at night while a \"roadshow operator\" would bring several hours worth of films and a 16mm projector. For a price, the audience would be treated to short films of gorgeous, naked women. These events were called \"stag parties.\" Films in this collection include a 1960s tattooed beauty and a creative use of stuffed animals. All of them showcase the types of luscious ladies who made the average working man a little happier to go home to their wife that night!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
