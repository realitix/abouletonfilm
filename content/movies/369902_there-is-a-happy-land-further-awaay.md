In March 2015, after Rivers\u2019 visit, Vanuatu was devastated by Cyclone Pam, laying waste large parts of the islands. River\u2019s 16mm  lm material has become a record of a place that has irrevocably changed. Filmed on 16mm and then digitised, island imagery of active volcanoes, underwater WW2 debris, children playing, and wrecked boats transform into intangible digital recollections of the island. Images of the eroded land merge with eroding  lm and deteriorate until they are no longer recognisable.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gbhV2l7A2Jkn91XwfiJrYfa0rZu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
