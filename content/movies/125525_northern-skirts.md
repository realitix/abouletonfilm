Jasmin, Tamara, Valentin, Senad and Roman live near the northern border of Austria. Their lives repeatedly intersect and drift apart. The characters involved are young migrants from the former Yugoslavia, Romania, Poland and Austria itself. Strangers in a strange land, they feel a sense of loss in their new, temporary environment. The five-some meet and get close to each other, hopelessly clinging to friendships and relationships with no future. They frequent caf\u00e9s and train stations dreaming of a better tomorrow. Often, they just fall back on the prospect of short-term affection in yet another doomed romantic or sexual encounter. Trying hard to suppress the memories of war and alienation, they try to find moral strength and warmth through one another.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fCXCQNNfp6v8PsJdwVo9nXXzIdl.jpg", "actors": ["Nina Proll (Jasmin Schmid)", "Edita Malov\u010di\u0107 (Tamara)", "Astrit Alihajdaraj (Senad)", "Tudor Chirila (Valentin)", "Michael Tanczos (Roman)", "Brigitte Kren (Krankenschwester)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "6gV_PC1xYXU"}
