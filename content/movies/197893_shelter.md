This surf movie does a great job of staying far away from the politics of surfing and focuses more on soul surfing. However, don\u2019t think that there aren\u2019t any surfers worth watching in this movie because there are plenty. \u201cShelter\u201d is jam packed with professional and well-known surfers such as Rob Machado, Taylor Knox, Joel Tudor, Mick Fanning, Dean Morrison, Jack Johnson, The Malloy\u2019s, Kelly Slater, Nat Young, Donavon Frankenreiter, Shane Dorian, Jon Swift and many more.  The soundtrack for \u201cShelter\u201d is similar to \u201cThicker Than Water\u201d and \u201cSeptember Sessions\u201d. It has a slower and mellower feel, featuring artists such as Mason Jennings, The Shins, White Buffalo and even surfers Jon Swift and Rob Machado.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2SbP4j6Aa7mXnCqZRpt4SBSDrb6.jpg", "actors": ["Rob Machado (Himself)", "Jack Johnson (Himself)", "Kelly Slater (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "qlt6fWP7AXc"}
