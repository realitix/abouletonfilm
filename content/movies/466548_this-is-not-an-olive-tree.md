The camera shakes, gets in and out of focus, and we don\u2019t exactly know what is happening. At first this is a strange disorientation, but then you get used to it through the cyclical mechanical noise that joins the images. The words of a peaceful female voice allows you to frame the film: a visual exercise after all can also be free.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Rebecca Schlesinger ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
