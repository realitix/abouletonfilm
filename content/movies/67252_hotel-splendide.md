The spa program consists of feeding the guests seaweed and eel-based meals, then administering liberal colonic irrigation. The spa is run by the family matriarch Dame Blanche until her death. Things continue on with her children running the resort until Kath, the resort's former sous chef and love interest of one of the sons, comes back to the island unannounced. Stranded between monthly ferries, she is a catalyst for a series of events that turns life as it is known at Hotel Splendide on its ear.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wMYQBrIXYOoFOLi4vbtzSGCA8I1.jpg", "actors": ["Toni Collette (Kath)", "Daniel Craig (Ronald Blanche)", "Katrin Cartlidge (Cora Blanche)", "Stephen Tompkinson (Dezmond Blanche)", "Hugh O'Conor (Stanley Smith)", "Helen McCrory (Lorna Bull)", "Peter Vaughan (Morton Blanche)", "John Boswall (Bellboy)", "Toby Jones (Kitchen boy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [22900, 63912, 94583, 31732], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
