The sportswomen chosen for this film compete in one-on-one sports, a metaphorical duality which expresses the two sides of the women\u2019s identity \u2013 the dark and the light. This film is a visualisation of human duality, of the internal personal struggle, constant in both art and life. The documentary paints a portrait of each woman as a contemporary heroine fighting against adversity while at the same time tenaciously working towards their dreams and personal legends.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
