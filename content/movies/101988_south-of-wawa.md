The only thing that could make it better is if her husband Terry buys her tickets to a Dan Hill concert in Toronto she wants to see. The problem is he will only go if his friend Simon goes and only if Simon has a date. The only person Lizette can find is Cheryl-Ann, a permanently happy, innocent waitress at the same donut shop, whom Lizette can't stand. When the night finally comes, things don't go as planned.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ne9SSCszSOiyq0k3L6LUHO48Cew.jpg", "actors": ["Rebecca Jenkins (Lizette)", "Catherine Fitch (Cheryl-Ann)", "Scott Renderer (Terry)", "Andrew Miller (Simon)", "Samantha Langevin (Helen)", "Stuart Clow (Cam)", "Dawn Greehalgh (Donna)", "Elias Zarou (Joe)", "Stephanie Forder (Darlene)", "George Touliatos (Serge)", "Alyson Court (Shannon)", "Michael Gencher (Jonny The Polak)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
