Even while they are breaking up, they are sufficiently in tune with one another to continue this practice. When the writer's wife takes off without leaving a note behind, people begin to suspect that he may have murdered her, and he plays along with this notion to the point of planting clues which would incriminate him. Obviously, no one with a shred of common sense would do such a thing, and these tricks get him into trouble. However, his troubles don't really begin until he starts to search for her in earnest.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r8QH0rxetsm4Qqik9WGfebaCCDa.jpg", "actors": ["Udo Schenk (Nico Thomkins)", "Anke Sevenich (Helen Thomkins)", "Christine Kaufmann (Clara Lilienthal)", "Hans-Michael Rehberg (Herr Jensen)", "Gunnar M\u00f6ller (Kommissar)", "Peter Sattmann (Eduard Hanstock)", "R\u00fcdiger Wandel (Alex Hanson)", "Jale Arikan (Ivy)", "Gustav-Peter W\u00f6hler (Dr. Tamiroff)", "Christiane Reiff (Monica Hanson)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
