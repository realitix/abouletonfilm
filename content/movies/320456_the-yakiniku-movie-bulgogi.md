As the title clearly states, pride of place goes to juicy, bite-sized meat, and viewers will get a delightful eyeful of food, food, and more food in this fabulously fulfilling gourmet comedy. Reveling in Japan's love for food-themed shows, the film revolves around a culinary battle of David and Goliath proportions, cheekily parodying Japanese cooking shows with Iron Chef-like editing, excited running commentary, and comedic how-to segments. The Yakiniku Movie also shines a light on the food culture of Japan's resident Korean population, proving that tasty food transcends all boundaries.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x7s109KhXc9zZvF6l6q5T7LlkxY.jpg", "actors": ["Ryuhei Matsuda (Tatsuji)", "Yu Yamada (Yori)", "Arata Iura (Torao)", "Ai Maeda (the reporter of \"Yakiniku Battle\")", "Kaori Momoi (the President of Toraoh)", "Tomoro Taguchi (a stuff of Toraoh)", "Riki Takeuchi (the MC of \"Yakiniku Battle\")", "Masahiko Tsugawa ()", "Shin Yazawa ()", "Hidekazu Nagae ()", "Takahiro Tamura (Kan Roujin)", "Soji Arai (Chinese Gangster (as Sohee Park))", "Yukihiro Hattori ()", "Takashi Nishina ()", "Soko Wada ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
