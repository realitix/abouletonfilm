Paulus Potter's simple postcard scene entitled \"The Young Bull\" (\"den jungen Stier\") is artistically alienated in an imposing fashion. By using assorted means of \"painting over\" and/or front projections, the figure of the bull in the center of the card is placed in a state of constant flux. A viewer may also choose to follow the shifting background behind the bull, which continues to recontextualize the bull in shifting worlds. Accompanied by a sound collage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tHf1O99Q4odH0Y4pHGbqLkVq1Qc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
