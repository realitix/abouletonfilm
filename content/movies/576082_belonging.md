We begin in the present as an unseen narrator recounts the assassination of his lover's disapproving mother, accompanied by hauntingly vacant images of urban alienation and garish city lights; we then flash back to witness the first encounter between the lovers-turned-accomplices, their mutual attraction and world-weariness emerging across a sleepless night and morning after. \u00c7evik imbues the proceedings with a stylistic confidence and willingness to bend the conventions of cinematic form to arrive at a complex, gripping double meditation on love and death.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pheXEk1WNY7Azcy5bfPSDngFZ2M.jpg", "actors": ["Eyl\u00fcl Su Sapan (Pelin)", "\u00c7a\u011flar Yal\u00e7\u0131nkaya (Onur)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
