Here, lives are defined by drugs, guns and violence. A state of perpetual urban warfare exists, with paramilitary gangs, leftist guerrillas and the US-sponsored Colombian military battling continually for power and control.\r This award-winning film portrays three of La Sierra's inhabitants: 22-year-old paramilitary leader Edison, a self-professed killer and father of six children by six women; gang soldier Jesus, ready for death at any moment; and Cielo, only 17 and already a mother with a boyfriend in prison.\r Entering a world where few journalists dare to venture, La Sierra reveals not only startling moments of violence and its aftermath, but also those of tenderness and faith which give the community hope for survival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gYlhfdGp0pRfSbXFm0YymwOe8FB.jpg", "actors": ["Edison Flores ()", "Jesus Martinez ()", "Cielo Mu\u00f1oz ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
