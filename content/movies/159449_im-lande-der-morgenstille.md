The images include women spinning on cotton wheels, families making traditional tteok (rice cakes), a look at Dongsomun (Seoul\u2019s ancient East Gate), which was destroyed just years later, and missionary activities in what is now North Korean territory.  The footage was once stored in a German monastery, but later the Nazi government, which sided with Japan in World War II, tried to confiscate it because some of it could be interpreted as espousing a critical view toward the Japanese occupational regime in Korea. Fortunately, a monk saved the film, hiding it behind a stone wall in the basement before he died during the war. The film was rediscovered in 1975 during a renovation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/flT86qsLl97Ys7mXcc8cbVBPhpQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
