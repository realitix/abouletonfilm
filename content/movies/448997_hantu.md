I'm guessing its Borneo, but it is never really said where they are going. They hike into the reclusive forest areas in search of Lake Setra Wingit (most likely has something to do with local legend). Leading the pack is Gali, a jock type character, much in tune with the generic American movie front-man. His girlfriend Rinjani is basically very devoted to Gali and very much in love, deciding on this wilderness hike out of love. Together with her comes her best friend Ray, geeky but rational, an ideal counterpart for Gali and also secretly in love with Rinjani. The pack also consists of funny guy Indra and his irritating girl Sofie.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v9NwSdgBaBTrQ4NN32UnmqjF2fy.jpg", "actors": ["Dhea Ananda (Rinjani)", "Dwi Andhika (Ray)", "Oka Antara (Gali)", "Andhika Gumilang (Indra)", "Monique Henry (Sofie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
