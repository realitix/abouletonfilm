Ando is known for his creative implementation of natural light, his deft interweaving of interior and exterior space and for designing structures that elegantly evoke the contours of the landscape in which they are set. Conceptually and aesthetically, his award-winning exposed concrete designs forge a link between traditional Japanese architecture, Zen and contemporary modernism, while also expressing his fundamental belief that \"to change the dwelling is to change the city and to reform society.\" Directed by Mathias Frick and produced by Susann Schimk and J\u00f6rg Trentmann, the film introduces viewers to his world-famous buildings and offers an exclusive look into his work process, as Ando shares his sources of personal inspiration and motivation and looks back over his 40-year career.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rt88DMUvOLhfHHi0k0gEWzgSbCv.jpg", "actors": ["Tadao Ando ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
