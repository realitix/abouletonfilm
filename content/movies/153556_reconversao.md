Echoing Dziga Vertov\u2019s concepts and Eadweard Muybridge\u2019s techniques (shooting only one or two frames per second), Andersen masterfully brings forward what makes Souto de Moura an original: the incorporation of the passing of time into architectural designs, positing them within a history fraught with class struggle and societal changes, in a continuum with ruins\u2014from which they may originate, and to which they will return\u2014and with nature\u2014which they frame, and by which they are framed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1i87KU18vIesF5Q6mKBR0rxyb2y.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
