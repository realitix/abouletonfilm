The first one---Sailing\" has young Hattie sailing her boat in a fountain and is quite dismayed when a frog sinks it. She brightens up when a friendly policeman restores it for her. The second unrelated segment---\"The Village Band\"--- features Hamilton Ham in the story of a village band that goes unappreciated by the populace until it is needed to greet a distinguished dignitary.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
