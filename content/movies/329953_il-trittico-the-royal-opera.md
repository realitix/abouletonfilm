The trio of operas offers a panorama of emotions, with the dark and foreboding Il tabarro and comic Gianni Schicchi bookending a heart-wrenching Suor Angelica.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m58HksJHh7H8oL5iPhnIbVNcmu2.jpg", "actors": ["Lucio Gallo (Michele/Gianni Schicchi)", "Eva-Maria Westbroek (Giorgetta)", "Aleksandrs Antonenko (Luigi)", "Ermonela Jaho (Sister Angelica)", "Anna Larsson (The Princess)", "Francesco Demuro (Rinuccio)", "Ekaterina Siurina (Lauretta)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "GixzTibp84Y"}
