An obsession with love, with art, originality, copying, with success, money and... with oneself. Sooner or later, if we lose our rational upper hand over it and let ourselves be dragged down by it, every obsession leads to destruction. But it is only when being dragged down, in spite of all the cuts and bruises, that we find a unique DELIGHT, if only for a few short moments - and what else is life really about? It is like a drug. What at first seems to be weak and trivial is capable of expanding and growing into a serious problem that can appear to be absolutely incomprehensible and absurd to those who have never experienced anything like it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A9QAUp6HWbqfaM0IHcoxfAfJmnm.jpg", "actors": ["Jana Plodkov\u00e1 (Milena)", "Martin My\u0161i\u010dka (Vladim\u00edr)", "Jan Buda\u0159 (Hynek)", "Jaroslav Plesl ()", "V\u00e1clav Neu\u017eil ()", "Martin Pechl\u00e1t ()", "Tom\u00e1\u0161 Je\u0159\u00e1bek ()", "Jakub \u017d\u00e1\u010dek ()", "Karel Zima ()", "Jana Andres\u00edkov\u00e1 ()", "Lenka Krobotov\u00e1 ()", "Karel Hynek ()", "Andrej Pol\u00e1k ()", "\u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nka Fingerhutov\u00e1 ()", "Jan Foukal ()", "Ond\u0159ej Bauer ()", "Tereza Vo\u0159\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 ()", "Zuzana Stavn\u00e1 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "G-UEWTrtC1Q"}
