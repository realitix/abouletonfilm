Which of course he later detracted and ended up making this anyway.\r\n\r\nSo I was wondering if the lack of public funding would make him lose interest just going to half ass it this time, but luckily that doesn't seem to have been the case. While not perfect I think this movie does get alot of things right and brings some more depth and character development to the character of Bill and Brendan Flether does get to showcase more range in his performance so yeah overall I was not let down.\r\n\r\nIf you are wondering if you can watch this without seeing the others the answer is, you can but it would be a mistake as the other 2 are better and well you'll lose out on context and stuff."}], "recommandations_id": [250388, 38780, 356334, 288710]}
