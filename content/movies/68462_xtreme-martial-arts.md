As young martial artists Mike Chaturantabut and Matt Mullins fight their way through the world's most prestigious tournament, East meets West in a stunning application of visual technologies and the biomechanical secrets behind the world's martial arts are revealed for the first time. Using a unique graphic technique that allows for \"in-the-body\" animation of joints and muscles, experts demonstrate the basic principles behind muscular torque and leverage - creating fighting and sparring scenes unlike anything you've ever seen. Weapon masters showcase the physics behind the fiercest weapon styles - the twin broadswords, the Chinese straight sword and the Katana - and demonstrate how warriors can quickly master even common household items - like a traditional Japanese hand fan - to devastate their opponents.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pLUYjqItLTtNAUyGNRZAVeMW46U.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
