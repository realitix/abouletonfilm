It is the story of a Montr\u00e9al commuter train, a unilingual ticket collector and a bilingual passenger. The passenger appears on screen himself to describe his bid to have tickets requested in French as well as in English. What ensued, and how even the railway president became involved, is illustrated with wit and humor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4hWdQ2B9TW6UJF4xK4EwzUlXzo0.jpg", "actors": ["Marc Bri\u00e8re (The Man)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
