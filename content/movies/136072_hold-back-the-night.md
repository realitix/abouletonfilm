But when morning comes and the authorities show up to disband the protesters, she hits a man with a log. This causes the two to have to go on the run. With the help of a sickly, but sympathetic woman, the two slip through police roadblocks. Traveling with her, they learn she is an ex-army lesbian who just wants to see a final sunrise at the Orkney Islands before her death.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pmkJSVrjNuqfdDkS5eFXX27AfiA.jpg", "actors": ["Christine Tremarco (Charleen)", "Stuart Sinclair Blyth (Declan)", "Sheila Hancock (Vera)", "Richard Platt (Michael)", "Julie Ann Watson (Jackie)", "Kenneth Colley (Uncle Bob)", "Tommy Tiernan (John)", "Bruce Byron (Killer's owner)", "Andrew Livingston (Barman)", "Peter Anders (Jacob)", "Nick Smith (Drug Dealer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
