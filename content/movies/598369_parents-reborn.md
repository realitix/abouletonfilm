While neighbouring countries such as Spain and Belgium recognize marriage equality and celebrate Pride, Italy has made little movement in the advancement of queer rights. What remains even more constant than homophobia is the critical role of family life. Blood runs thick in Italy. Large, closely-knit families are revered; parents are staunchly devoted to their children. Parents Reborn follows several families as they adjust to the news that their sons or daughters are homosexual. Director Claudio Cipelletti\u2019s camera doesn\u2019t shy away from raw emotions as parents cope with their crushed expectations and begin to accept their children for who they are. In turn, these parents experience their own transformation\u2014or rebirth\u2014as they forge renewed family bonds and approach traditional Italian life in progressive new ways.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ee8YcXxzZTwylkj5cP4KYVUR3J.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
