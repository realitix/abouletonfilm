JILL HENNESSY portrays Doctor Katherine James, a dedicated psychiatrist going through the motions of daily life, unaware she is as LOST as the patients she treats. Her life is sparked by Evan KATE GRAY, an acclaimed poet and free spirit who while traveling in Thailand experienced one of the deadliest natural disasters in history. Shot on location in New Orleans and Thailand, LOST IN TIME explores the layered connection between a Doctor and Patient and the power of human connection.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9YUU5XIFu7g74F8kwsS5KRRCSu9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
