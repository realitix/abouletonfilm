It all begins when reporter Florencia tries to get in contact with a guerrilla group for an interview and ends up abducted by a masked couple and taken to a radio station where the two begin broadcasting their manifesto. The male terrorist, Pedro, is so moved by his earnest words that he removes his mask to speak more clearly. Florencia finds herself strangely moved by his sincerity.
