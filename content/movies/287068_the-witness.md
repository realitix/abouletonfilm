A construction contractor who grew up on the mean streets of Brooklyn, Eddie Lama is probably the last person you'd figure to be an animal activist. Indeed, Eddie was raised with a deeply ingrained aversion to animals, as he explains in the award-winning documentary \"The Witness.\" But when a pretty woman asks him to take care of her kitten, he finds himself reluctantly agreeing as a ploy to get a date, not knowing that his life is about to change forever. In the end, it is the kitten who captures his heart, opening his eyes to the wonder of other living creatures and awakening him to the richness of the human-animal bond.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mr0Z5RMxbapTx7tjTqQKbW0OUgd.jpg", "actors": ["Eddie Lama (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "3Gv0y1qYx1w"}
