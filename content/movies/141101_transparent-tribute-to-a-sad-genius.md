Because having everybody know your inner thoughts would be terminally embarrassing, Japanese society passes a law that Transparents must never be told of their affliction. They're moved into special cities where everybody is instructed to act as if the person is totally normal... it's worth going to such lengths because Transparents invariably have massive IQs and have produced many useful things for society. The result is a Truman Show-esque situation where everybody around Transparent Masanobu Ando has to act completely normal.\r A psychiatrist is sent into the city to observe Masanobu Ando and attempt to divert his attentions away from surgery (his desired career) to a more socially beneficial career in research. She learns how hard life is for him, and for some reason falls in love with him...", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7W4DkIiOTsRnOPjaxaOo5GkZrQy.jpg", "actors": ["Masanobu Ando (Kenichi Satomi)", "Kyoka Suzuki (Yoko Komatsu)", "Rina Uchiyama (Megumi Kawakami)", "Yutaka Matsushige (Shigefumi Shiraki)", "Akira Terao (Takayuki Azuma)", "Takehiko Ono (Hirokazu Kunimitsu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
