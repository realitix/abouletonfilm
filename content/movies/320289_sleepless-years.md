The factory workers are shown being exploited by imperialists, capitalists gone berserk, and fascists, more or less in that exact chronological sequence. The heavy-handed approach does much to undercut the belief that when socialism finally takes over, the lives of the workers are brought up to a human level. In this instance, audiences might prefer a more nuanced and subtle statement, no matter what the message.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uUe79wzkhf8FZDLYpUqlqHN9QcI.jpg", "actors": ["\u00c9va Ruttkai (Vilma)", "G\u00e9za Tordy (Karesz)", "\u00c9va Vass (Ir\u00e9n)", "G\u00e1bor Ag\u00e1rdi (T\u00f3th)", "T\u00f6r\u0151csik Mari (Kat\u00f3)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
