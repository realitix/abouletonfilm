It speaks not at the target audience but to it in age-appropriate communication. Seldom should the parent need to explain a word. The expressions and mannerisms used should fit the expected experiential maturity of the target audience. Those that might yet be outside of your child's understanding should provide an opportunity for your child to learn and expand his/her expressional communication.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iq1p9eLajbWxL8A5zlktNrtCuFx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
