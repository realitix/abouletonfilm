It could be the beginning of an argument or an argument petering out \u2026  the only thing those people have in common is the space they occupy. They are totally isolated within their own activity or mental space \u2026 you are looking at two people interacting but you project what the discussion or argument is about. The viewer is put in the position of the people in the restaurant who are onlookers. And as an onlooker you're straining to understand what exactly is taking place. I want people to construct their own narrative, so they're looking at it and giving it endless possibilities.' 16mm film.
