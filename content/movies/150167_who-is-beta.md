Who is Beta? follows two statuesque survivors drawn irresistibly together only to be entranced by the arrival and sudden disappearance of a third, the bewitching raven haired Beta. With its cartoon-like depiction of extreme violence and desire, Who is Beta? offers a heady Pop-infused companion to Hunger for Love. Yet beneath its giddy play of surfaces, dos Santos' underappreciated film gradually reveals a darkly ambiguous metaphoric dimension. -Harvard Film Archive", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e5a3dtmu6ztRUclQFOmnwjR4o9A.jpg", "actors": ["No\u00eblle Adam ()", "Sylvie Fennec ()", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Pasquale ()", "Regina Rosemburg ()", "Isabel Ribeiro ()", "Nildo Parente ()", "Manfredo Colassanti ()", "Ardu\u00edno Colassanti ()", "Ana Maria Miranda ()", "Fl\u00e1vio S\u00e3o Thiago ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
