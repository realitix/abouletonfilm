Linked in an oblique, dream-like way, these short, sharp stories describe Alice's survival in an everyday world of bizarre logic and strange emotions. A collection of allusive, absurdist, narrative episodes, which often resemble dream fragments; it's a place where miracles unfold in the bathroom and desire appears on a bus, where menacing joggers roam the suburbs and there's something sinister about hats.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Alice Garner (Alice)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
