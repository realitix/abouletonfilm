When Anthony Torino, the volatile heir-apparent, turns his deadly sights on the DA prosecuting him for the cold-blooded murder of his own cousin, Johnny is finally moved to act. Despite his role as family accountant, Johnny is quite the marksman. He convinces a reluctant Anthony into letting him eliminate DA Elizabeth Jones. Johnny's plan to simply warn her instead is thwarted by the arrival of a pair of Torino family goons sent to supervise his first hit. The ensuing shootout leaves Elizabeth wounded, one goon dead, and Johnny arrested.
