Music, dances and suits are added to the renaissance text, turning this spectacle into a hybrid cultural manifestation. The Tchiloli, performed by amateur groups, integrates only men that are prominent figures in certain quarters of the island. The most popular and traditional group is the \"Formiguinha\". In this company, the main roles are transmitted from generation to generation. The oldest members try to keep the tradition within the family.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
