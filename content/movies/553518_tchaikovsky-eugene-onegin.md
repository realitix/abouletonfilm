A repertoire classic, Willy Decker\u2019s streamlined production makes the Paris Opera echo once more to the strains of Russian romantic music. Edward Gardner conducts an exceptional cast including Peter Mattei in the title role and Anna Netrebko as Tatiana.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eflMLaOuAQLbSPWSjFllu10ZVkR.jpg", "actors": ["Anna Netrebko (Tatiana)", "Peter Mattei (Eug\u00e8ne On\u00e9guine)", "Pavel Cernoch (Lenski)", "Varduhi Abrahamyan (Olga)", "Hanna Schwarz (Filipievna)", "Edward Gardner (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
