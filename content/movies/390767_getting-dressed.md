For her, it is daily work to feed her bird and to look at the town from her window.  Because she doesn\u2019t go out, she does not even put on clothes.  However, this daily life has ended.  She has run out of the cornflakes that she eats every day. As we get up in the morning and put on clothes, we are alive in a social system.  Nobody understands whether it is the correct world.
