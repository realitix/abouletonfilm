The village is once visited by a couple of wanderers, and strange things start to happen afterward. A new schoolteacher is sent to the area. She stirs erotic fantasies in Kaziuk. In a stir of frustration Kaziuk cuts down a family tree - a sacrilegious act in the eyes of his family. Going a step further and using a scythe for cutting the rye instead of a sickle brings the whole village against him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2FXX3RPMkOpv4nGIKv3s79hfnm7.jpg", "actors": ["Krzysztof Majchrzak (Kaziuk)", "Anna Seniuk (Handzia)", "Joanna Sienkiewicz (nauczycielka)", "Jerzy Block (Tatko)", "Marek Siudym (Micha\u0142)", "Tomasz Jarosi\u0144ski (Ziutek (w napisach: Tomek Jarosi\u0144ski))", "Franciszek Pieczka (dziad / Pan B\u00f3g)", "Anna Milewska (Matka Boska)", "Arkadiusz Bazak ()", "Aleksander Fogiel ()", "Jan Jurewicz ()", "Zbigniew Kaczmarek ()", "Jacek Ka\u0142ucki ()", "Marek K\u0119pi\u0144ski ()", "Jan Pawe\u0142 Kruk ()", "Tadeusz Wojtych ()", "Wojciech Zag\u00f3rski ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
