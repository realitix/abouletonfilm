Nothingness, this absence, this lack of something, is a major force in Karabelas\u2019 film. It\u2019s disorienting, just like the sound which the director uses carefully, subtly even, in order to reinforce the voice over, written by his friend Christos Makridimitris. The almost nihilist voice-over accompanies the lonely journey of a young man through fields, through ruinous structures, along rivers. One wonders whether the voice over is actually the voice in the young, unnamed protagonist\u2019s mind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AanhuWzUy1WvESyvG0h1bJYZsua.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
