The repeated ritual of Tutuguri that Tranquilino the saweame sang and danced six times in a short, strictly accurate duration. Secret words from which only emerge vowels, dance that builds a sacred space between the four cardinal points of a cross, a black and pagan sign. A native solar rite, prior to the Spanish conquest. The assembly here builds in a single plane the two poles of real time and an expanded space-time, from dual material: Tutuguri and Carreras.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wgS6fVcFyucHBw9H0OFqICjX8bb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
