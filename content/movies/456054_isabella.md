{"tmdb_id": 456054, "title": "Isabella", "original_title": "Isabella", "slug_title": "isabella", "date": "2015-01-01", "genre": ["Animation / Documentaire"], "score": "5.0/10", "synopsis": "This film aims to capture the stories of the aging Isabella, but also captures her condition and loss of cohesiveness as she loses herself into dementia and Parkinson's. It is also a very personal film since the subject is the grandmother of one of the co- directors. The idea is interesting as it links one strong clear memory, told several times, to other fragments and truths of her condition. Animation is sparingly but cleverly used to complement the delivery and avoid it just being a talking head.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s9ssZ5cZ77XmNdGycIP1FnO7xXT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
