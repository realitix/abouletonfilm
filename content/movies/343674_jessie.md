We've had some good Stephen King adaptations in 2017 (and some bad ones, lookin' at you _Dark Tower_), but _Gerald's_ _Game_ gives Andy Muschietti's _It_ a run for its money as the best one of the year. The core story of _Gerald's Game_ is enough to earn it a passing grade, but everything surrounding it (and after it) elevates it to the next level.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"}], "recommandations_id": [452507, 376570, 419479, 433808], "youtube_key": "twbGU2CqqQU"}
