However, in the wake of a brutal hazing death on campus, his estranged older brother, Pete, is rallying against the Greek system. Nick ignores Pete's protests and rushes Psi Theta Epsilon, notorious for its rumored hazing practices. As Nick begins the pledging process, he relishes the bonding and the partying, especially with Sophie, an irresistible sorority tease. When Nick\u2019s close friend, Mimi, struggles with her own sorority experience, and his fraternity\u2019s rumored hazing turns dangerously real, Nick begins to question everything. But is he in too deep? A modern retelling of the ancient Greek myth of Dionysus -- the god of wine, revelry, and ecstasy -- HAZE is a raw, shocking glimpse into a world of institutionalized savagery and into the heart of a young man driven by a desperate need for acceptance and brotherhood.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iqO4HOZJJwxHRAx6zayf1Xg6JWb.jpg", "actors": ["Kirk Curran (Nick)", "Mike Blejer (Pete)", "Jeremy O'Shea (Taylor)", "Kristin Rogers (Mimi)", "Sophia Medley (Sophie)", "Bridget Garwood (Gretchen)", "Alicia Marie Marcucci (Ann-Marie)", "Kendra North (Psychology Professor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [483755, 499056, 131057, 490538], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
