The story revolves around five teens somehow being translated into a fictitious 1986 slasher movie called \u201cCamp Bloodbath.\u201d The prematurely deceased mother (Malin Akerman) of the teen heroine (Taissa Farmiga) starred in the movie and she gets to meet her again, albeit as a young woman.\r\n\r\nWhile this 2015 film is a throwaway flick it\u2019s reasonably entertaining, especially if you\u2019re familiar with slasher films. What I like best is that it has heart and you can feel the loving relationship of mother and daughter. It\u2019s also nice to see Nina Dobrev again, who\u2019s one of the most alluring females in the cast, although she\u2019s outshined by curvy Angela Trimbur as airhead Tina.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 28 minutes and was shot in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with some stuff done in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"}], "recommandations_id": [241843, 218784, 254191, 323373]}
