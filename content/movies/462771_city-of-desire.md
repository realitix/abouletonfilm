Sandra's father is putting on the pressure for her to inherit his morally-corrupt throne, but her morals dictate that she have nothing to do with it. However, Sandra's childhood friend Josie (Josie Ho) has gotten herself into serious debt and desperately needs any help Sandra can offer. Will Sandra help her friend at the cost of her own morals? It's now up to her to decide between upholding her own beliefs and making serious ethical sacrifices for the sake of her friend.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ica6A3pGuhUjn3HZuan8EiA4ErJ.jpg", "actors": ["Anthony Wong (Pastor Gan Da Shi)", "Sandra Ng Kwun-Yu (Sandra Lei / 13th Sister)", "Josie Ho (Pepper)", "\u65b9\u4e2d\u4fe1 (Johnny)", "Law Kar-Ying (Uncle Motor)", "Kristy Yang (Kindergarten teacher)", "Cheung Tat-Ming (Wen Xiu's lover)", "Alice Chan ()", "Blacky Ko Sau-Leung (Uncle Cat)", "Philip Keung (Brother Jiang)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
