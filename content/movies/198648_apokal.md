It is difficult to say, as there is no story to be discerned in this non-stop pastiche, heavy with symbolism but with no other distinguishing features. It was, however, a German entry in the 1971 Cannes Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n2W5kabLDQS6sPwtnrSNxL52tXm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
