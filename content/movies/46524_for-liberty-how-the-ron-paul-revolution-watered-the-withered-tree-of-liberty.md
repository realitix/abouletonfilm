Advocating a philosophy of sound money, a non-interventionist foreign policy, strict Constitutionalism, and individual liberty, Dr. Paul inspired a unique grassroots movement unmatched in American history - the repercussions of which continue to reverberate today and into the future of the American psyche. For Liberty: How the Ron Paul Revolution Watered the Withered Tree of Liberty follows this historic campaign from the perspective of grassroots activists, and showcases the unique, often bizarre, yet groundbreaking projects they undertook as they brushed aside traditional campaign methodology.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Ar6a9o7mhHamgH07wB7CBYGo0hP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
