Along the way, they pick up a couple of sexy hitchhiking ladies and decide to pull over for a pitstop. Eventually, they make it to the bar and uncover that the deep voiced country singer that also plays there is also a pimp who uses the \"waitresses\" to make him some extra cash. It is up to our musician heroes to put an end to the singer and his operation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yto06pBI5ZQeE9bLXwIBaN9CUbm.jpg", "actors": ["Rene Bond (Sue)", "Ric Lutze (Dave Anderson)", "Sandy Dempsey (Jan)", "John Paul Jones (Billy B)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
