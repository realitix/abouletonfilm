The acting is mostly awful, all the characters are idiots but then it's a slasher so it comes with the territory I suppose.\r\n\r\nIt's not completely without it's redeeming qualities though, the gore is neat and the set ups to many of the kills are well put together and the last 20 minutes or so were fairly good. But overall more reasons not to watch it than to watch it."}], "recommandations_id": [55723, 14686, 70448, 122369], "youtube_key": "T6rtXAqfSa0"}
