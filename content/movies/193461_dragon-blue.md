It's a completely unmotivated but thoroughly spooky encounter between Mayuko and a demonic ghost, and she's saved by an ancient priest spirit who explains her legacy. \"Why does this always happen to me?\" she ponders before flying off to a remote island to investigate an ancient curse and battle a legendary Sea Demon. Mayuko befriends a burly, chivalrous detective and a little orphan boy nicknamed \"the Devil's Child\" who hides his own dark secret.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Ap0AMlbLDLNz3aA9RHYSB6Sa6Wl.jpg", "actors": ["Hiroko Tanaka (Mayuko)", "Keiji Mutoh (Ryusaki)", "Maro Yumeno (Satomi)", "Kouichi Kasai (Kisuki)", "Naomasa Musaka (Saga Terumitsu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "m5RziWlri3Q"}
