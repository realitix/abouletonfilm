North-Europeans are forced to migrate. Lucas, a middle-class man gets stranded in a coastal village in search of a passage to a brighter elsewhere. Through the difficulties and dilemmas he faces, BRAK explores how far the end justifies the means and how the price we are prepared to pay, can turn a sacrifice into betrayal.
