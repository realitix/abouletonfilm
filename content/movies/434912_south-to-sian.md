Surf movies come and go, a million waves in exotic locations and surfers flown in for three\u2010day shoots on perfect swells, but the spirit of adventure never dies. What began as a three\u2010month trip to a collection of surf breaks off the beaten track turned into a two\u2010year odyssey of exploration, injury, companionship and 4,000km of two\u2010wheeled, single\u2010finned escape from the real\u2010world burdens of modern life. Harrison Roach and Zye Norris pack their bags, a diverse quiver of boards, two bikes and a 50\u2010dollar tent into a 1970s Land Rover and embark on an epic quest from the southern reaches of Bali, through the Indonesian archipelago to Northern Sumatra\u2019s isolated Lagundri Bay.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4dIniSXBaTAhCmw02pdXvgkqO7x.jpg", "actors": ["Harrison Roach ()", "Matt Cuddihy ()", "Zye Norris ()", "Husni Ridhwan ()", "Deni Firdaus ()", "Tai Graham ()", "Tyler Warren ()", "Jared Mell ()", "Lewie Dunn ()", "Agi Agassi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
