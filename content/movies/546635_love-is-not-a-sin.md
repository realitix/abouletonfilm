The film is an exuberantly bizarre tale about two teenage girls who have so such affections to each other. However, a hidden camera finally destroys their fancy as the recorded contents unveil a possible truth that one of them is probably a male. The director has skillfully shown a dramatic shift of mood through the use of his cameras, from an atmosphere of exuberant teenage joy to a lost in one\u2019s own sentiments. He has also blended several elements into his plot, such as the innocence of youth, some soap materials and a sense of horror. This definitely wakes up the sensations of its audience.
