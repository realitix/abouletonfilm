In other words, just as in the theatre, the attempt means making the words burst out of the narrow framework of the stage or tableau.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eZu1nU3ZqxmbenktnY5mvCrgpCX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
