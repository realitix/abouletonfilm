This lineup had an exceptional rhythm section , who help give the songs a lift and they make me want to watch and listen again and again .  One gets a good idea of how mellow Roxy could be as the ballads are convincingly done , with stirring lead work by Neil Hubbard on MY ONLY LOVE being the highpoint of a standout version .  A good release - maybe one day they will be able to clean up the picture . I'm very happy with the music , however .  Worth a spin for those fans of this influential band .", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z5xOs31WUOIqspTWdDHbqGjvnPS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
