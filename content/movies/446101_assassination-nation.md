The sort of thing that'd usually earn all of its points out of pure catharsis, but is to confronting to be any way actually cathartic, and hits the message over and over again instead, which normally I hate, but _Assassination Nation_ works because of the hate. It's a very hateful movie, with just a sliver of what you might have expected it would be like based on the trailer right at the very end, but otherwise, grim.\r\n\r\nIn a good way though. A way that works, makes you think, but still has all #TheAesthetic\u2122 you can shake a stick at, it just makes you feel bad for shaking that stick. Do you like _The Purge_ but feel that the mirror it holds up is too general? Wanna feel bad about feeling good? Give _Assassination Nation_ a crack.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"}], "recommandations_id": [397722, 545957, 512199, 414018]}
