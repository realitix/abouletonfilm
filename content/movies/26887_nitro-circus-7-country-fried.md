Travis rode out of the completed trick, but re-named it the TP7 as he still needs 20 degrees of rotation to call it perfect! Chad Reed made a guest appearance as a Nitro Circus Crew member and took part in some explosive Supercross action caught in its full glory on super high speed cameras. The results were incredible! As a final gesture to confirm that Chad has really joined the Circus, he rode over to the scene of Travis' TP7 and proceeded to land his first ever backflip \u2014 all on his full factory 450 Suzuki!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ddU3ZglcKMCK2xAMEpINgDGc9Zm.jpg", "actors": ["Travis Pastrana ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
