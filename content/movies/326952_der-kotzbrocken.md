A mountain of unpaid traffic tickets takes her to the judge, who buzzes her 300 social hours in a home for the disabled. In addition, he puts her on his own brother: Georg, a dreaded patient in the home, who sits in a wheelchair since an accident and only bitterness for his environment left. But Sophie can not rausekeln. So it happens that something special develops out of initial antipathy: trust, friendship, love. The emotional tragicomedy knows how to implement a supposed taboo subject sensitively.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tprpJAXz2XqtjdQSbwyN7TF5Uj8.jpg", "actors": ["Aglaia Szyszkowitz (Sophie)", "Roeland Wiesnekker (Georg)", "Martin Rapold (Jacques)", "Arsseni Bultmann (Linus)", "Emilie Neumeister (Laura)", "Eva L\u00f6bau (Frau Marold)", "Annika Kuhl (Barbara)", "Felix V\u00f6rtler (Richter Mair)", "Patrick Schorn (Martin)", "Enno Kalisch (Dr. Hesselmann)", "Michael Sch\u00f6nborn (Herr Siebert)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
