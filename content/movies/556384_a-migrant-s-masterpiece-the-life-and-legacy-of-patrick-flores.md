The film chronicles his childhood and early years as a migrant farm worker, high school drop- out and cantina musician. Patrick Flores dreamed of becoming a priest, a nearly impossible goal for a Mexican American in those days in Texas. The film is a microcosm of the struggles and triumphs of Mexican Americans. The film captures Patrick's amazing journey to the top hierarchy of the Catholic Church, becoming one of the most influential Latino leaders in the United States.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yH59B5fxdFlcyo607CDzqi5jqpb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
