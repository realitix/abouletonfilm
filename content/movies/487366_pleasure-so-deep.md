He's got a sex-crazed wife who can't seem to get enough, and a daughter who spends her time in massage parlors delving into a little hooking on the side. The godfather sends his right hand man to check up on his daughter (Lauren St. Germain), little suspecting that the guy will actually fall for her. The plot thickens as Lauren finds out about the counterfeiting business and gets moved into a spacious villa on the Italian coast. The don sends his man along to keep an eye on her, which he's all too happy to do. Still, the daughter has no time for the guy until he proves his worth by saving her from a trio of roughnuts who are intent on getting what they want by force.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mzwk5wrozmprySb4IVyJhv7abXA.jpg", "actors": ["Barbara Moose (Angela)", "Richard Allan (Jim Scott)", "Karin Hofmann (Lydia)", "Kathleen Kinski (Lydia)", "Brigitte DePalma ()", "Guy Royer (Marco)", "Steven Sheldon ()", "Elsa McDonald ()", "Lauren St. Germain (Angela)", "Richard Hammer ()", "Greta Lindstrom ()", "Paul Meyerson ()", "Lydia Greely ()", "Nolan Velours ()", "Ursula Fontaine ()", "Peter Kwapinski (Mario)", "Barbara Legrand (A photo model)", "Judy London ()", "Mario Moretti ()", "Paola Pasetti ()", "Teri Patrick ()", "Mario Pollak ()", "Mario Pollak (Paolo)", "Doris Wessoly (Vera)", "Jane Iwanoff (Manager of boutique (uncredited))", "Dominique Saint Claire (Prostitute (uncredited))", "Rolf Zigan (Bordellkunde (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
