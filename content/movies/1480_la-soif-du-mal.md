Janet Leigh is on hand as the detective\u2019s new bride, an American.\r\n\r\n\u201cTouch of Evil\u201d (1958) was written/directed by Welles (loosely based on a book) and has a huge reputation as a B&W noir-ish cult flick. There ARE interesting technical things going on as far as camera angles, lighting and impressive long takes (e.g. the opening sequence). It also has a notable classic cast with Leigh thoroughly stunning, not to mention Joanna Moore, Marlene Dietrich, Joi Lansing and a cameo by Zsa Zsa Gabor on the female front.\r\n\r\nYet I otherwise found the picture talky, nigh surreal and noticeably hokey with an unengrossing story and dubious acting, e.g. the hooligan Mexicans and the eye-rolling Shakespearean lunatic \u201cnight man\u201d (Dennis Weaver). Seriously, viewing this film is like entering Welles\u2019 head on an acid trip.\r\n\r\nThat said, the film offers quite a bit to digest and I could see it playing better on additional viewings, which explains its cult status, but I\u2019m not interested. There are far more fascinating and compelling B&W dramas with noteworthy casts from that general era, like \u201cThe Misfits\u201d (1963).\r\n\r\nI viewed the long reconstructed version, aka the \u201cdirector\u2019s cut,\u201d which runs about 110 minutes while the original studio-butchered version runs 93 minutes. Interestingly, the film wasn\u2019t shot anywhere near the border, let alone the Texas border, but in freakin\u2019 Venice, Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C"}], "recommandations_id": [1092, 3090, 963, 654], "youtube_key": "UiVLwYnFF9o"}
