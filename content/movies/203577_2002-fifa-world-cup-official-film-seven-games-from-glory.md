It was the first World Cup in Asia and the first to be co-hosted by two countries. The official film captures the unique spirit of this event in 120 minutes of football - on the pitch and behind the scenes. This is one of few official films able to offer a hint of the world behind the dressing room door - Senegal's victory celebrations, Mexico's prayer and team talk and the referees debriefing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/et1AxzJ2d827wJU7wGWb55PziYz.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Powell (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
