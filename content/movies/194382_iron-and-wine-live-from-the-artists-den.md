The show was a sort of homecoming for frontman Sam Beam, who grew up a few hours from Atlanta, and he delivered a two-hour, 24-song set for the invitation-only audience of 500. The eleven-piece band played virtually all of Iron and Wine\u2019s most recent album, Kiss Each Other Clean, plus favorites like \u201cNaked as We Came\u201d and \u201cBoy with a Coin,\u201d before Beam closed the remarkable night with a luminous solo version of the brand-new \u201cFlightless Bird, American Mouth,\u201d from the Twilight: Breaking Dawn soundtrack.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Awu47sDmj2aaGtdXLbjEEj3R1D8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
