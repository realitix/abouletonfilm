Using still photographs, found objects and unsettling creations that briefly come to life via stop-motion animation (which evokes the work of the Brothers Quay and gives them an even more unreal presence), filmmaker David Lowery tells a phantasmagorical story, part fantastical mystery and part nightmare, as a primal memory. A CATALOG OF ANTICIPATIONS weaves imagination and experience into a haunting tale recalled in snapshots of recollection, a dark fantasy with a tactile texture that grounds it in the physical world and narration that frames it as a coming-of-age moment. - Sean Axmaker", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kYTdUL5W7rFplBeZqHrV3rYbgW9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
