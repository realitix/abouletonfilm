Holberg held a version (Australian) of the welterweight title for a month in 1914. From what I could see he made two films, in Norway in 1918, while fighting there from 1917 to 1919. So his film's survival rate is 50%. Billed as a 'folke komedie' in 4 acts (I saw no comedy), it does end with the obligatory boxing match. An interesting note is that the actor playing his opponent is Fred Boston. Waldemar Holberg knocked out a boxer named Fred Boston in Oslo in 1918, but it is Boston's only recorded match. Makes one wonder.....", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aHevlakX8IONgSfcQrRJpLguahH.jpg", "actors": ["Solveig Gladvedt (Claire Staalhammer)", "Waldemar Holberg (Albert Fjeld)", "Fredrik Andersen (Staalhammer, Wulkanv\u00e6rftets direkt\u00f8r)", "Thomas Boston (Tommy Fjeld, Albert og Claires s\u00f8nn)", "Fred Boston (Jack Dalton, godseierens s\u00f8nn)", "Joh.
