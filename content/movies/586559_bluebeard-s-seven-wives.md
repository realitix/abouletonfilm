The idea of that shakes him up so much that he gets distracted at work, comes up short in his accounts and gets fired. Unable to find another job, he begins to work as an extra at a nearby film studio to earn money. One day the leading man of a picture John is working on gets into an argument with the director and storms off the set. Angered, the director sees John and, deciding that he'll show his arrogant star that he can make a movie idol out of just about anybody, picks John to replace him. As it turns out, John has a real talent for acting and before he knows it he becomes a star. Unfortunately, \"stardom\" isn't what John thought it would be.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kt6FFH4xq4q9WeCo4aBJxZsbu3t.jpg", "actors": ["Ben Lyon (John Hart / Don Juan Hartez)", "Lois Wilson (Mary Kelly)", "Blanche Sweet (Juliet)", "Dorothy Sebastian (Gilda La Bray)", "Diana Kane (Kathra Granni)", "Sam Hardy (Gindelheim)", "Dick Bernard (Film Magnate)", "Andrew Mack (Film Magnate)", "Daniel Pennell (B.C.
