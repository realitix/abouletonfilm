Another 37 years passed before that record was broken by Mark McGwire. Five days after McGwire's feat, Sammy Sosa broke the brand new record. And the race was on! Fans watched breathlessly as the record passed between the two men and time left in the season dwindled. Relive it all, from Ruth, to Maris, to the final days of the 1998 Sosa/McGwire slug-fest.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mqsE5GlT16QWirt3KmuBoAghqS1.jpg", "actors": ["Mark McGwire (Himself)", "Sammy Sosa (Himself)", "Roger Maris (Himself)", "Babe Ruth (Himself)", "Len Cariou (Narrator)", "Jack Buck (Himself)", "Ken Griffey, Jr. (Himself)", "David Cone (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
