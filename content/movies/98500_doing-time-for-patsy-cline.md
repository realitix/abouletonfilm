He hopes to hitchhike to Sydney Airport where his take-off into a successful country/western singing career will hopefully begin. However, fate and his naivety find him hitchhiking with a psychotic drug thief named Boyd, and Boyd's mesmerising girlfriend, Patsy. The plot then splits into a series of parallels, flash forwards and flashbacks. One depicts Ralph\u2019s imprisonment after being framed for drug trafficking. The other follows the dramatic ascent of his career to hype status and the pairing between the dynamic Patsy and himself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wgWPf6sRnkErhjPFoliokmH07pG.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Roxburgh (Boyd)", "Miranda Otto (Patsy)", "Matt Day (Ralph)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
