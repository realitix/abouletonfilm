Within a week after crossing the border, his reputation falls from a respected global political figure to an infamous communist spy. During a five-year-long trial, he was arrested and held in custody. This throws Korean society into turmoil and brings a big conflict between the Conservative and the Progressive parties. The filmmaker calmly contemplates this long period of the incident in detail and depicts a society with an indifferent manner. The story builds through an accretion of whimsical facts and it sometimes brings up uncomfortable truths which will irritate viewers. This film is a camera inside of us that evokes what viewers may have tried to forget.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iD9I9gIjcC83KW9rbtyPnRULhzr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
