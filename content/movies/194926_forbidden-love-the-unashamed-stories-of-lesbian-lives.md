Interspersed among the interviews and archival footage are four dramatized chapters from a pulp novel, \"Forbidden Love\": Laura leaves her hick town and heads for the city, where she meets Mitch in a bar. Sparks fly, and so do laughter and joy. Ann Bannon, one of the writers of those paperback novels about forbidden love, talks about the genre.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mlsg1YaqYb2IwqYyIq5gJdEMf9x.jpg", "actors": ["Keely Moll (Herself)", "Stephanie Ozard (Herself)", "Ann Bannon (Herself)", "Reva Hutkin (Herself)", "Lois M.
