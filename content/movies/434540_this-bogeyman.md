The monster does not have a distinct appearance, but simply is \u201ca non-specific embodiment of terror,\u201d the artist clarifies. The film combines images shot on expired Super-8 film, found footage, a sound collage of male gibberish and digitally corrupted noise, and a square black framing that at times spills its outer edges over the center of the imagery.\" - M\u00f3nica Savir\u00f3n, Museum of the Moving Image", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
