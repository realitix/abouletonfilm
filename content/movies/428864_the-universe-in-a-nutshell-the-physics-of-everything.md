Professor Michio Kaku explores how physics could potentially shrink the science of the big bang into an equation as small as e=mc2. Physics powers every electronic device in your living room, underwrites every technological breakthrough, and thanks to advances in string theory, could allow us to escape the heat death of the universe, explore the multiverse, and unlock the secrets of existence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q4yc3I7nHiN7X9gkJZw19hXKc8v.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
