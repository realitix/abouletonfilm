Three young Japanese samurai traveled to Shanghai on a mission during the Taiping Rebellion of the mid-19th century, and what they saw there was that China was dominated by Europeans and enraged Chinese people were rebellious.  A family drama plays out against this historical background. After a Chinese home is destroyed by careless British shelling, killing the father and crippling a daughter, the surviving son vows revenge but begins to see that his true friends may be the Japanese.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6b0qAaV1jdeC6W19GWt0RUvrSpz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
