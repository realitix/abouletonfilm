Other pieces commissioned by Pinschewer (e.g. a commercial for ink) are considered lost. \"Die Barcarole\" is an unusual take on the \"Romeo and Juliet\" theme, with the suitors arriving in Venetian gondolas (a barcarole is a musical piece whose measure is designed to resemble the swaying of a gondola).", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
