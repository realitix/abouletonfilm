However, while watching the news, Sylvia will learn about Kasia's gruesome death, so without hesitation, she will decide to leave the convent to settle things once and for all with the monstrous Fantom Whipper. But unbeknownst to Sylvia, the Fantom Whipper is also looking for her to claim what used to be his, intending to exact his typical kind of inhumane discipline to all those who foolishly stand in his way. As a result, Sylvia, armed with a big gun and an even bigger desire for revenge, will soon discover the Whipper's house, unaware that, inevitably, she will get a deserving strict punishment for her rebellion, sadly, in more ways than she could ever have expected or hoped.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7WSOwNVIe6lfRm5awVRjZwdCayG.jpg", "actors": ["Stacy Silver (Stella Diamond)", "Helmut Lund (Inspector Brennan)", "Zdenka Novotna (First Nun)", "Helga Cernik (Second Nun)", "Tiffany Lust (Sylvia Novak)", "Kate Blonde (Kasia)", "Julia Orlova (Sister Amanda)", "Sarka Kay (Newsreader / Fourth Nun)", "Maria Vaslova (Mother Superior)", "Dorothy Slime (Fantom's Mother)", "Carla Slatina (Third Nun)", "Kristi Lust (Nun in tower)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
