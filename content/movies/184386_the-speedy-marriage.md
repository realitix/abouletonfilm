They have taken the action out of about three oft-repeated comedy tales and crowded it into these two reels. Miss Wiley is certainly a lively young lady and a glutton for punishment. She takes many a hard fall and an equal number of rough knocks. She is also capable of better material than she is given to exploit in this one.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Wanda Wiley ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
