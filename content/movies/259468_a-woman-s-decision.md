She realizes that soon she won't be needed much at home as the boy grows up and the relationship with her husband crumbles. It's only when an embezzlement is discovered at the office and she stands up to her management, that she realizes life has more to offer. She meets a well-off former classmate, married to an American. Then she meets Jacek and starts contemplating possibilities of a new start. She discovers love for the first time, but turns to old ways rather than to break loose.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ofrKVcz7EZgO4Eaw0oL3Yy6xEiN.jpg", "actors": ["Maja Komorowska (Marta)", "Piotr Fronczewski (Jan)", "Marek Piwowski (Jacek)", "Halina Miko\u0142ajska (R\u00f3\u017ca)", "Zofia Mrozowska ()", "Barbara Wrzesi\u0144ska (Ewa)", "Mariusz Dmochowski (dyrektor zak\u0142adu)", "Chip Taylor (James)", "Eugenia Herman (Zofia)", "El\u017cbieta Karkoszka (Maria, kole\u017canka Marty)", "Celina Mencner (Halina, kole\u017canka Marty)", "Ma\u0142gorzata Pritulak (Anna, kole\u017canka Marty)", "Danuta Rinn (kole\u017canka Marty)", "Kazimiera Utrata (kole\u017canka Marty (w napisach: Kazimiera Utrata-Lusztig))", "Krzysztof Machowski (kolega Jacka)", "Stefan Szmidt (GOPR-owiec)", "Dariusz Adamczuk ()", "Marian Friedmann ((w napisach: M.
