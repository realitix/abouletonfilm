Strolling through the concrete and neon-lit landscape of the city, they experience the transformations it undergoes daily. As they drift night after night, they become the living interface of a metamorphosis that cannot be perceived or understood if not by becoming part of it. Thus, Hanqi and her friends catch fleeting glimpses of beauty in an environment that most people would only perceive as alienating, hostile or cold. Like an ambient composition by Brian Eno or Philip Glass, the film moves through minimal variations, completely immersed in its nocturnal beat. Space becomes time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jIGZb9WHqmCwoMBHeh9VjUeVgen.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "uIzwzbE4Y8A"}
