Office secretary Nikki (Nikki Owen) is disillusioned with her fraught, \u2018sometime\u2019 relationship with her married boyfriend, Peter. Emotionally scarred by the dysfunctional relationship, she all but gives up on the possibility of finding anything more meaningful. But in the wake of a torturous and disturbing blind date, Nikki meets Tony (Tony Ryan), a \u201cblack fella on a white bus\u201d. Despite their obvious differences and Nikki\u2019s disillusionment, the charismatic Tony shows Nikki that there is indeed room for love and romance in the desperate world of Blacktown.
