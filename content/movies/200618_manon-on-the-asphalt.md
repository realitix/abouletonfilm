She turns a corner. Something happens. As she lies on the asphalt, a crowd gathers around her and an ambulance arrives; we hear her voice, first confused as to what has happened, then telling us how her friends and her mother will receive word, and how her friends will gather to talk. As images move back and forth in time, she remembers recent events and expresses some small regrets.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nSHvqNYyOobVef7FUeCxUJpI7v5.jpg", "actors": ["Aude L\u00e9ger (Manon)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "140047686"}
