Printmakers have depicted the human condition in all its glories and struggles so powerfully that perceptions, attitudes and politics have been dramatically influenced. And the value and impact of this art is even more important today.  In the new documentary, ART IS... THE PERMANENT REVOLUTION, three contemporary American artists and a master printer help explain the dynamic sequences of social reality and protest. Among the wide range of 60 artists on display are Rembrandt, Goya, Daumier, Kollwitz, Dix, Masereel, Grosz, Gropper, and Picasso. While their stirring graphics sweep by, the making of an etching, a woodcut and a lithograph unfolds before our eyes, as the contemporary artists join their illustrious predecessors in creating art of social engagement.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7RwbrDl1xTHxmSoz55FXY0vf56E.jpg", "actors": ["Sigmund Abeles (Himself)", "Ann Chernow (Himself)", "Paul Marcus (Himself)", "James Reed (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
