After his girlfriend's consequent suicide, Baldini has his illegitimate son, a 17 year old, kidnapped and taken to a decadent seaside resort in the country's extreme southern coast. To protect the operation, the Senator chooses a former mistress in her late 50s, the now-nurse Serena (Betty Faria), to take care of the kidnapped illegitimate son during his secret captivity.
