Freshly graduated, they are relocated to a remote Thuringian village after causing a computer breakdown. There, they are supposed to work in a small company that has no clue of economic management. The rather helpful computer system from West Germany plainly lacks compatible software. But Frank and Komminke are not allowed to work with the hardware , although it is them who could make most out of the complex system. Eventually, and with the help of consultant Petra whom both are in love with, they break into the system control room on New Year\u2032s Eve and start up the computer with their special program.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nfm0MvKmdfdEohtaHYONcU44bqN.jpg", "actors": ["G\u00f6tz Schubert (Frank Lettau)", "Matthias Wien (Peter \u201eKamminke\u201c Galetzki)", "Simone Thomalla (Petra Ansch\u00fctz)", "Gerit Kling (Gina)", "Jaecki Schwarz (Walter Kremmel)", "Peter Sodann (Werner Heilmann)", "Dieter Mann (Dr. Bauer)", "Walfriede Schmitt (Vogelsang)", "Fred Delmare (Hausmeister)", "Doris Schmude (Silikon-Wally)", "Gisbert-Peter Terhorst (Menzel)", "Harry Merkel (1.
