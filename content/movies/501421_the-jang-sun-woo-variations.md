Directed and narrated by British film critic and scholar Tony Rayns, who is well known for his work with Asian cinema, THE JANG SUN-WOO VARIATIONS offers a fascinating profile of Jang's life, mind, and work as he prepares two films, an animated shamanist feature and RESURRECTION OF THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL.
