Of the 97 people on board (36 passengers, 61 crew), there were 35 fatalities; there was also one death among the ground crew. The actual cause of the fire remains unknown, although a variety of hypotheses have been put forward for both the cause of ignition and the initial fuel for the ensuing fire. The incident shattered public confidence in the giant, passenger-carrying rigid airship and marked the end of the airship era.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8tfspAgkMoW8gNzqUgWrEXi5Ere.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
