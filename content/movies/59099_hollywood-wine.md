Unfortunately, fallen star/tabloid queen Jamie Stephens already made it famous. Hollywoods constant rejection due to what Diane refers to as \"TJS\" (\"Too Jamie Stephens\") has made her bitter, frustrated....and, yes, whiny. Co-worker/boyfriend Jack Sanders doesn't help matters. His idea of ambition is letting it ride. Now he's in major debt to a trigger-happy mobster who, interestingly enough, has a thing for Jamie Stephens. Jack's only way out? Convince Diane to be Jamie and wipe out the debt having one meal with a made man. It's literally the performance of her life. With Jack's on the line.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kvJewsaWPfl0qpWhcGwygAe6dZ1.jpg", "actors": ["Chazz Palminteri (Geno Scarpacci)", "Nicky Whelan (Jamie Stephens / Diane Blaine)", "Norm Macdonald (Sid Blaustein)", "Chris Kattan (Jack Sanders)", "Horatio Sanz (Tony)", "Vivica A.
