{"tmdb_id": 421735, "title": "Pilots on the Way Home", "original_title": "Lendurid koduteel", "slug_title": "pilots-on-the-way-home", "date": "2014-06-09", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "Having suffered the loss of their plane, three pilots inexplicably find themselves stranded in the middle of the desert. While following the perilous and unpredictable course that will ultimately lead them home, they fall prey to visions and must confront the siren call of their own strange fantasies. With Pilots on the Way Home, Priit and Olga P\u00e4rn (Divers in the Rain) have created a new, satirical meditation on male-female relations. The film tackles masculinity and the male psyche with the same pointed sense of the absurd that has marked Priit P\u00e4rn's previous films. Pilots on the Way Home is also a journey through time and space, and to the universal sources of artistic eroticism. Olga P\u00e4rn is a master of the art of animating sand, giving Priit P\u00e4rn's unique line drawings a warm and subtle texture reminiscent of etching. Her work is perfectly matched to the impassioned beats of this tale.  - Written by NFB", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uyHOhblIjVgXOdGHhG51udt5cjQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
