What does it mean to survivors of acid violence? What does it mean to people in their environment? How do the two world-views interact? What do concepts of 'fear', 'power', 'innocence' and 'beauty' mean to us? The Newborns attempts to provide a lens to the survivors of acid violence, to look forward and gaze back. They take us through the ennui of their domestic and public spaces in a nameless dystopian city, its factories, houses and motels, and its promises, never honored.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qSf2uecu2bCWOOOyKsaSHQGq37L.jpg", "actors": ["Laxmi Agarwal (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
