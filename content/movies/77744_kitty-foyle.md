Told in flashbacks, the film starts with Wyn asking Kitty to run away with him to South America and live in sin as he is already married.\r\n\r\nWe see the Kitty is torn between, wealthy and monied Wyn (Dennis Morgan) or marry a safe and sturdy Doctor Eisen  (James Craig) who woos her.\r\n\r\nKitty enchanted by the dashing Wyn from Philadelphia aristocracy but his family disapproves of her.\r\n\r\nThe film has a feminist bent as it recounts of the independence of women in 20th century America. It also with Dalton Trumbo as a screenwriter has political leanings which lends the film more interest."}], "recommandations_id": [67880, 78734, 42401, 123665]}
