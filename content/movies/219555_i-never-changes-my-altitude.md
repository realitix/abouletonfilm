She's closed the business to fly away with an aviator (Bluto, of course). But it's hardly what she expected; he has her painting his plane, while it's flying; when she says she's rather go back to Popeye, he tries to throw her off the plane. Popeye sees this, and takes off in a plane, just in time to help her out. The boys get into a dogfight, and Bluto manages to demolish Popeye's plane.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uwRPpYQAVJsMHwWbAhEZTsRbXpu.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Mercer (Popeye)", "Gus Wickie (Bluto)", "Mae Questel (Olive Oyl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
