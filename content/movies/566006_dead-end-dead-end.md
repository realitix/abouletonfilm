These were not happy years for me and they are not happy films. They were all conceived as silent films and I was very consciously working out my ideas about visual rhythm and visual/musical form. When I had them transferred to digital I had the opportunity to see how they would work as sound films - How hard would it be to compose musical tracks for them that would complement their spirit without detracting from their purity as silent film compositions? I had lots of fun in the process and have learned a great deal from them about the interaction between the two modalities as kinds of musical expression. I will leave it to others to decide if they are successful or not.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iNnz0nhcNFxgLYkpIlIanXh3vja.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
