In conversation one learns how formative it was for him and is to grow up and live in Berlin Kreuzberg, which foundations were laid for his views already in the school time and why he even deals in his music with topics such as gentrification or refugee policy. In doing so, he commits different locations with a personal connection and also lets people from his circle of friends have their say, such as other members of the band project Antinational Embassy, his label mate Herzog and the Anti Turista Squad. With a view to the future, this DVD complements its content and focuses on its further work: activism.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h4wg3oIfXsfc6m1ux2xMhn6cdTM.jpg", "actors": ["PTK (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
