But just as they appeared to be getting a really break big, they just disappeared. Thirty years later, a cable TV reporter for MIX TV, a musical station, is removed from her show because of being stoned on air. Her station gives her a choice of being dismissed or investigating what happened to Sweetwater. A blending of modern day fiction and past fact is then blended in this biographical story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wJdj1QEWTQBUV5MdZ6kEHa5X8Wj.jpg", "actors": ["Amy Jo Johnson (Nansi Nevins)", "Kelli Williams (Cami Carlson)", "Kurt Max Runte (Alex Del Zoppo)", "Robert Moloney (Fred Herrera)", "Nancy Moonves (Mrs. Nevins)", "Michael Anthony Rawlins (Ian)", "Adam Ant (Todd Badham)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
