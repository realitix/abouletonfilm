The event was filmed by an EMI film crew for a DVD release, Demon Days Live, in late March 2006. It was later announced that an American version of the event would take place from April 2 to April 6, 2006 at the famed Apollo Theater in Harlem. Within an hour of release tickets were sold out.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4MjNN7jUhabbFVXTJVMWMcwWzpk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
