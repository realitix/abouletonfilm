After passing by her without preventing her suicidal fall into the depths, a sensation of failure and guilt changes his life. He cannot forget her. Driven by a feeling of remorse and the fever of illusion, he roams through the city night and day looking for traces of her existence. This journey through the tumult of his conscience leads him deeper into his own loneliness and the depths of his soul, as he gets more and more entangled in the destinies of the woman and of the people who were attached to her. He finds himself confronted with the pain of yearning and guilt, the cruelty of love and desire, and the search for forgiveness, release and salvation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zoJdzLIC08QIGkZiAwL1mEdkgS1.jpg", "actors": ["Egons Dombrovskis (Matiss Zelcs)", "Nikolaj Korobov (Alexej Mesetzkis)", "Vigo Roga (Inspector)", "Aija Dzerve (Alina)", "Gundars Silakaktins (Bartender)", "Andris Keiss (Alina's Husband)", "Rihards Gailiss (Alina's Son)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [163312, 413043, 89494, 143437], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
