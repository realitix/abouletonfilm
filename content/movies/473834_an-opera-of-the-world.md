The film revolves around a 2008 performance of Bintou Were, a Sahel Opera, by Z\u00e9 Manel Fortes with a libretto by Koulsy Lamko, in Bamako, around which Diawara builds a story about migration, interweaving interviews with documentary and archival footage. In the course of the film, one crosses into the world of opera from the tradition of sung wisdoms and sentiments, which has characterized West African culture for centuries. If opera is often understood as an \u00fcber-European art form\u2014the Gesamtkunstwerk invoked by Richard Wagner\u2014Diawara chooses to meditate on its movement or migration as opposed to its expansion or totality. What happens when opera moves south, from Europe to Africa, just as so many people from that continent are moving north, in search of better lives?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Alexander Kluge (Himself)", "Fatou Diome (Herself)", "Nicole Lapierre (Herself)", "Richard Sennett (Himself)", "Manthia Diawara (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
