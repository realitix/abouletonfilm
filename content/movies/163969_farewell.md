At journey's end she returned to America a star, thanks to her good looks and gutsy charm. But her reports on the ship's travels for the front pages of the Hearst press empire only told part of the story. In her diary she recorded a far more intimate journey-her struggle to get over her secret affair with shipmate, mentor, and married man Karl von Wiegand. Combining spectacular archival footage of the journey across New York, Siberia, Tokyo, and the Pacific with narration drawn from Drummond's articles and her private journals, this sweeping black and white documentary stands as a vision of technological marvels and global hope in that narrow window between world wars when everything seemed possible except true love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wPViTLNJYXXCwnK02fwmKlA2JpI.jpg", "actors": ["Poppy Elliott (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
