David performs three tracks on the DVD from The Code of Funk and explains how to use the multimedia files that are included in the book/audio package. He also demonstrates the grooves from the songs in the book and describes in detail the origin and development of each one. In addition, David explores the core principles of his hugely influential style.  In a separate section of the DVD he explains some of the primary topics found in his groundbreaking book Future Sounds.  There are also video demonstrations of \"Stretch That Groove\", an entire section on odd groupings, and much more.  Whether used as a study companion to The Code of Funk, or as a stand-alone educational resource, this DVD represents another important educational product from David Garibaldi and Hudson Music.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
