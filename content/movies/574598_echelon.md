We then see images of performances that depict a disabled woman, followed by shots of wrecked trains. In contrast to these images of destruction are images from the daily life of the artist and his art.  The film ends with the demolition of a church building.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
