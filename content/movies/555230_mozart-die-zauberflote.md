Die Zauberfl\u00f6te is heard more often and has been more frequently performed, discussed, queried and interrogated than almost any other work in the history of opera. It is rare for the mysteriousness and multiformity of a work to be adjured with such mantric intensity. It is equally rare for a work to enjoy such undisputed success despite all these debates \u2013 and for over two hundred years at that.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f45eVmpQUoWqM0p7F1xIG6s4NE.jpg", "actors": ["Matthias Goerne (Sarastro)", "Mauro Peter (Tamino)", "Emma Posman (Queen of the Night)", "Christiane Karg (Pamina)", "Adam Plachetka (Papageno)", "Maria Nazarova (Papagena)", "Michael Porter (Monostatos)", "Constantinos Carydis (Conductor)", "Klaus Maria Brandauer (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
