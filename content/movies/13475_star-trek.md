Enterprise, le vaisseau spatial le plus sophistiqu\u00e9 de l'histoire.  Dans ce p\u00e9riple sem\u00e9 de dangers, d'action et d'humour, les nouvelles recrues doivent tout faire pour emp\u00eacher le plan diabolique d'un \u00eatre mal\u00e9fique mena\u00e7ant l'humanit\u00e9 tout enti\u00e8re dans sa qu\u00eate de vengeance.  Le sort de la galaxie est entre les mains de deux officiers que tout oppose : d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9, James Kirk, originaire de la rurale IOWA, t\u00eate brul\u00e9e en qu\u00eate de sensations fortes, de l'autre, Spock, issu d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 bas\u00e9e sur la logique et rejetant toute forme d'\u00e9motion.  Quand l'instinct fougueux rencontre la raison pure, une improbable mais puissante alliance se forme et sera seule en mesure de faire traverser \u00e0 l'\u00e9quipage d'effroyables dangers, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 personne n'est encore jamais all\u00e9.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xPihqTMhCh6b8DHYzE61jrIiNMS.jpg", "actors": ["Chris Pine (James T.

I did not, however, appear to like it as much as the rest of the whole damn planet.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the decent helping of Australian actors in the mix (like personal favourite Chris Hemsworth, above). I can get behind the colourful and impressive special effects spectacle. Most of all I dig the reboot angle they pulled. The whole time travel/tangent universe thing is the perfect breeding of remaining true to the original, while still not constricting themselves to the old canon. Fantastic idea.\r\n\r\nBut I didn\u2019t love it. I\u2019m a big fan of origin stories, but I personally feel that _Star Trek_ never really breached past that point. The first half was brilliant, getting to know the characters, the world, the ideals, everything. But in the latter half it seems they just sort of went \u201cWell, we spent a bunch of time doing stuff good, but now we don\u2019t have enough time left to make an actual movie out of this\u2026 Oh well, just chuck an hour of lasers in there and we\u2019ll worry about that next film!\u201d which just isn\u2019t good enough. When _Into Darkness_ comes out later this year, the format will probably pay off, but looking at the merits of Star Trek alone, I think it fell short.\r\n\r\nSimon Pegg (_Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead_) as the new Scotty and Zachary Quinto (_American Horror Story, Heroes_) as the new Spock were both solid choices, but other casting decisions like Winona Ryder (_Black Swan, Alien: Resurrection_) as Spock\u2019s mother were an off-shot in the worst possible way.\r\n\r\nI suppose though, in science fiction, it\u2019s often safety first and little steps. As a member of what is probably the most frowned upon of the genres, I wish this Star Trek reboot all the best in its inevitable future, and it seems it will make good use of it. But for now, the solo film itself didn\u2019t reach as far as I felt it could have with a little harder work towards the end.\r\n\r\n62%\r\n\r\n_-Gimly_"}], "recommandations_id": [54138, 10764, 534, 49538], "youtube_key": "iGAHnZ555nI"}
