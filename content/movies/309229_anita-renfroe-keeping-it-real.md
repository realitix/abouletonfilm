In this showcase of her stand-up comedy, Renfroe's shtick is refreshingly candid, targeting the best -- and worst -- of popular culture, from Martha Stewart to turning the big 4-0. She also pokes fun at pretension with parodies of hit songs.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
