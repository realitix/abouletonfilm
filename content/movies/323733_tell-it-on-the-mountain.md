But in a way, these hikers are just like you and me. They have jobs and families, they love their creature comforts. Yet something pulls them to be in nature, to leave everything behind and embark on what\u2019s called a thru-hike. Thru-hiking the Pacific Crest Trail involves walking 2, 663 miles from Mexico to Canada. The journey lasts from April to October. That translates into about 20 miles a day, every day\u2014on foot. These brave souls face bone-dry deserts, raging rivers, snow-covered mountain passes, mosquitoes, blisters, torrential rains\u2026 and the urge to quit. Follow a half dozen of the 300 or so hikers who attempt a PCT thru-hike every year. Armed with cameras, they give us an insider\u2019s view into what it takes to spend half a year living in the wild.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
