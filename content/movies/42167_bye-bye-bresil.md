A young accordion player is completely enamored of Salom\u00e9, and he begs to come along. The Gypsy Lord shrugs, and the accordionist and his pregnant wife, Dasd\u00f4, join the troupe. Television is their enemy as they go from the coast deep into the Amazon. Salom\u00e9 lets the accordion player sleep with her once, with Dasd\u00f4's knowledge. He's moon-struck. Then, after Dasd\u00f4's baby is born and financial disaster hits the troupe, and the accordionist must choose between seeing his wife a prostitute and leaving the caravan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aNRtE1XlnrpqpZgmSWjeqYgXYUE.jpg", "actors": ["Jos\u00e9 Wilker (Lorde Cigano)", "Betty Faria (Salom\u00e9)", "F\u00e1bio J\u00fanior (Ci\u00e7o)", "Zaira Zambelli (Dasd\u00f4)", "Jofre Soares (Z\u00e9 da Luz)", "Pr\u00edncipe Nabor (Andorinha)", "Marieta Severo (assistente social)", "Emmanuel Cavalcanti ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [252293, 86324, 86321, 74349], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
