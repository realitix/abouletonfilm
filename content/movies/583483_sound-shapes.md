It equates four simple shapes with four simple sounds, made by punching shapes into black film and scratching into the film's optical sound track.  The film uses a bar structure similar to a music score. Each bar lasts one second (24 frames of film) and is divided into 2, 3, 4 or 6 aural and visual beats per second (bps). These are used in alternating patterns such as:\r 2/3, 3/4, 3/4/6, 2/3/6  In each section of the film an arbitrary relationship is established between image, sound and beats per second, for example:\r circle = 12 scratches per frame (high pitch sound) at 6 bps\r rhombus = 6 scratches per frame (mid pitch sound) at 4 bps\r triangle = 3 scratches per frame (low pitch sound) at 3 bps\r rectangle = 1 scratch per frame (percussive sound) at 6 bps  A print of the film was hand-painted in 2006  G.S.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rb6HruT1UPl6NBqqIDScMY92PEA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
