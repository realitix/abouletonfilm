In three different continents she meets the people behind the sources of pollution and discovers the heartbreaking dilemmas that lie at the heart of it. For example in Africa, where some people are looking for alternatives for DDT, however its grey poisonous clouds are a cheap way of saving millions of lives in malaria prevention. The disastrous health issues that result on the long term are conveniently put aside. While the Inuit would rather deny the problem at hand, it has become her difficult task to convince them of its severity. And while the expedition members\u2019 wellbeing is subject to the condition of their environment, it becomes increasingly clear that their lives are not the only ones at risk in the delicate entanglement of nature and mankind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c3HBPXVuRoqfHk1ZGyp2Ex2MGwi.jpg", "actors": ["Pipaluk Knudsen-Ostermann (herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
