The darkness that perfectly obscures these races simultaneously indicates problems of representation: How do you represent a ritual, a culture, a community that firstly does not want to be shown, and secondly, is not your own \u2013 a world briefly encountered that remains foreign. How to show something without falling into the trap of an exoticising gaze? To this end the artistic intervention that provides the context remains offscreen: the city, location and protagonists are present, but are never seen.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
