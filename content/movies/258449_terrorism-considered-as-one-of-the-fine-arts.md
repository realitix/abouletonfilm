The film incorporates a record of the subversive underbelly of the city into a poetic meditation on conspiracy theory, ecoterrorism, time and cinema, retracing the story of The Third Man. Adapted from a trilogy of Whitehead's own Nohzone novels, the objective and subjective becomes blurred as the film director merges with the fictional detective in a journey into the murky activities of covert counter-insurgency groups. Kaleidoscopic in intent, the film mixes Noh theatre, Victorian novels, Vienna after the war, opium, domain names and Jacob's ladder \"pitched twixt Heaven and Charring Cross\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mUShaz88m5ifUUbegOcgSsz0bxE.jpg", "actors": ["Samantha Berger ()", "Alice Schneider ()", "Sophie Strohmeier ()", "Liza Tsyzina-Whitehead ()", "Joanna Woodrow ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
