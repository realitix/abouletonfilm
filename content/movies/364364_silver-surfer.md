An image on the borders of apprehension, becoming more and more abstract.  The surfer surfs, never surfs anywhere, an image suspended in the light of the projector lamp.  A very quiet and undramatic film, not particularly didactic.  Sound: the first four minutes consists of a fog-horn, used as the basic tone for a chord played on the organ, the rest of the film uses the sound of breakers with a two second pulse and occasional bursts of musical-like sounds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xoaDWu4OH5dlHeEyEY4Tq5xs7qf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
