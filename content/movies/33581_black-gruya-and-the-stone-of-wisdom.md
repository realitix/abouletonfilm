With the help of a fortune teller, Karadjordje (the leader of the Uprising) learns that, according to a legend, somewhere in the hills exists a Stone of Wisdom which makes you, if you hit your head against it three times, more wise. So he employs his nephew Crni Gruja, with assistants Ceda Velja and Bole, to find him this miraculous Stone.
