A legend of the avant-garde theater, Foreman is also a passionate film fan, whose taste ranges from American avant-garde to Manoel de Oliveira. ONCE EVERY DAY marks his first foray into feature filmmaking in 35 years. Highly visual, complexly edited and without a traditional narrative, the film zeroes in on a group of 25 people acting out a series of semi-ritualistic behavior patterns. But their eccentric impulses are aborted in unpredictable ways with each attempt at action or development. According to the director, \u201cThe film slowly evolves a time-mosaic of reformatted consciousness.\u201d Longtime admirers of Foreman\u2019s work will see an intriguing adaptation of his unique theatrical style to the cinema. And for everyone else: Welcome to the extraordinary world  of Richard Foreman.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aNPjNNAuv8eGh67mWWrBUUhqJxy.jpg", "actors": ["Dana Block ()", "Abby Marianetti ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
