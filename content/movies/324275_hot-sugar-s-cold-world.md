Considered a modern-day Mozart, the young electronic musician/producer records sounds from everyday life\u2014from hanging up payphone receivers to Hurricane Sandy rain\u2014and chops, loops and samples them into Grammy Award\u2013nominated beats. He\u2019s living the life every musician dreams of, complete with an internet-phenom girlfriend, rapper/singer \u201cKitty.\u201d But when she dumps him, Hot Sugar is set adrift. Fleeing to Paris, he tries to regroup, searching for new sounds and a sense of self.  Filmmaker Adam Lough mixes scenes of Hot Sugar at work on his vintage recording devices with surprising soul-searching reflections he offers to the camera. As tweets and posts about the broken couple blow up on the internet, Hot Sugar\u2019s road trip presses onward, revealing even more exotic layers of the man and his music. Fun and flash, this lyrical journey offers audiences a fascinating peek into a modern artist\u2019s creative process.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8IURj8sjMeEvpYNput0ViHitt61.jpg", "actors": ["Shelby Fero (Herself)", "Nick Koenig (Himself)", "Neil deGrasse Tyson (Himself)", "Jim Jarmusch (Himself)", "Martin Starr (Himself)", "Rachel Trachtenburg (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [285869, 303132, 405510, 174334], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
