Scientists believe they've pinpointed a cause for the loss of many of the amphibians: the chytrid fungus, which flourishes in high altitudes. Unfortunately, they don't know how to combat it. Included: an isolated forest in Panama that has yet to be touched by the fungus, thus enabling frogs to live and thrive as they have for eons.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wY3RbCjDscEZtN4ZLwMcqVotqbM.jpg", "actors": ["Allison Argo (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "1_cGPLO8dos"}
