In his soul, however, there resides an inextinguishable desire for adventure. And so once a month he poses as a playboy. As the mysterious and wealthy Mr. Kristian he goes to the exclusive Orient Bar where he does not skimp on generous tips and where he platonic-ally seduces beautiful and elegant women. In the salon he speaks of love and the magnificence of exotic lands, which he has supposedly come to know on his wanderings abroad. In reality he has read all of this in the travel agency's brochures.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kKnxfChLRKOqBWWASgByt2k9nbc.jpg", "actors": ["Old\u0159ich Nov\u00fd (\u00fa\u0159edn\u00edk Alois Nov\u00e1k alias pan Kristian)", "Nata\u0161a Gollov\u00e1 (Ma\u0159enka, Nov\u00e1kova \u017eena)", "Raoul Schr\u00e1nil (Fred)", "Bed\u0159ich Veverka (Petr)", "Adina Mandlov\u00e1 (Zuzana Rendlov\u00e1, Fredova snoubenka)", "J\u00e1ra Kohout (\u00fa\u0159edn\u00edk cestovn\u00ed kancel\u00e1\u0159e Josef Novotn\u00fd)", "Anna Steimarov\u00e1 (Ma\u0159en\u010dina teti\u010dka)", "Jaroslav Marvan (\u0159editel cestovn\u00ed kancel\u00e1\u0159e Kr\u00e1l)", "\u010cen\u011bk \u0160l\u00e9gl (eleg\u00e1n s kapesn\u00ed\u010dkem)", "Franti\u0161ek Filipovsk\u00fd (advok\u00e1t JUDr. Dvo\u0159\u00e1\u010dek)", "Josef Belsk\u00fd (Orient bar manager)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [50788, 49587, 66126, 116174], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
