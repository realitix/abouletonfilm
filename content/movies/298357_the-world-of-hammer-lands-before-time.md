And while Hammer may be best-known for their notorious series of gory Dracula movies, bloody Frankenstein adventures and chilling, satanic epics, few films had a greater impact on the '60's than the unforgettable genre known as \"Hammer Glamours.\"  The \"Hammer Glamour\" epics delivered their own singular vision of history -- and especially pre-history -- with liberal doses of both flesh and fantasy.  With special effects as eye-popping as the actresses, these films created puberty's essential bridge between the thrill of cool monsters and the sensation of gorgeous women.  If you're a student of anthropology, this is a world you may not recognize.  But if you're looking for a twisted vision of the past that only Hammer can provide, you've come to the right place.  The Hammer Glamour legacy lives, and indeed the world has never been the same.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q0uNcBqcvChPSabN2UnQ6VA6YoY.jpg", "actors": ["Oliver Reed (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
