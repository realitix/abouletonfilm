A gust of wind animates the paper's pages, conjuring strange and fantastical creatures: a bridge that becomes a caterpillar, a steeple turning into a bird, a dome transformed into an octopus. Elemental forces have been unleashed. Skilfully wielding paper cut-outs, origami, and a healthy dose of humour, filmmaker Emmanuelle Loslier plunges us into a fantastical world in which Montreal\u2019s urban landscape has never been so alive.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d04PsV6bFNQfpN4hWRaV4QYGU35.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
