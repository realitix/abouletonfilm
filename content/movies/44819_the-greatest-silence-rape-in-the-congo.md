In addition to the dead, hundreds of thousands of woman and girls have been raped. Rape, explains a British colonel, is a weapon of war, part of a destabilization covering the theft of valuable minerals. Rape victims are traumatized, injured, abandoned by husbands, pregnant, and ravaged by disease.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v4Fmys4fLJNDwULJ2RKFUKUAoiV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "0oGGpulYsZY"}
