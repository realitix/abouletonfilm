The book's story tells of young love and suicide. In this East German film, based on a book by Thomas Mann, Lotte (Lilli Palmer) was the woman who served as the model for the heroine in the novel Werther. She comes to Goethe's hometown for a visit, and her experiences there eerily re-create episodes from the book. Goethe comes across as a pompous old bore, and his friends as pandering sycophants, in this very proper communist party-sponsored, anti-heroic movie.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ssmr0BpVEZV2Lw9QLZAJqH31Wdx.jpg", "actors": ["Lilli Palmer (Lotte)", "Martin Hellberg (Goethe)", "Rolf Ludwig (Kellner Mager)", "Hilmar Baumann (August Goethe)", "Jutta Hoffmann (Adele Schopenhauer)", "Katharina Thalbach (Ottilie von Pogwisch)", "Monika Lennartz (Charlotte, Lottes Tochter)", "Fred Delmare (Bauer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
