In 2014, following the release of their latest album Indie Cindie, they are bringing their roaring guitars and stop-start dynamics to the Other Stage. They come armed with an impressive back catalogue of intertwining male-female harmonies, expressive, cryptic lyrics and punk-rock-surf riffs.  Pixies made a strong bond with the BBC in 1998 when they released the Peel-session compilation Pixies at the BBC in 1998. The compilation was recorded over several sessions between 1988 and 1991 at the BBC. The album is characterized by its raw, under-produced sound.  One of the most influential American alternative rock bands of the late '80s, Pixies have been through various line-up break-ups and make-ups but they will stand united for Glastonbury this year!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oC7qOqTfGTj0CWlzb9sw0oVp0At.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
