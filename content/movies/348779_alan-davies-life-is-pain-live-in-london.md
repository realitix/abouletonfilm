Recorded live at Hammersmith Apollo the hilarious new show, Life Is Pain, covers every aspect of the modern condition. While famous as an actor \u2013 the titular role in BBC hit Jonathan Creek \u2013 and a household star for his role as Stephen Fry\u2019s foil on QI, Alan was sorely missed from live stand-up. His first show back is a glorious insight into Alan\u2019s unique worldview \u2013 growing up in the \u201870s, losing his mother as a little boy, the vagaries of Facebook, sex toys and being a father are just some of the subjects he tackles.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pvBbstOGmKZmHVUytX2uQYUUpxu.jpg", "actors": ["Alan Davies ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
