Filmed in Lviv in 2016-17, it shows a complex picture of the coexistence of diametrically different communities in the same post-Soviet space. The annual rituals associated with the events of World War II, initiated by various political, social and ethnic groups, have the character of a performance and, despite the tragedy of the historical context, often cause a comic effect. The film is a collaboration of the artist Ekaterina Shapiro-Obermair and the historian Alexandra Wachter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dOPD5qxAfMPCjb0Q73M95g6aG4j.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
