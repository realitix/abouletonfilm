The filming, taking place at a bungalow, is not smooth-sailing from the beginning. Egoistical veteran actress Khaty is fashionably late, and shooting can`t start until she`s on set. The director is also late as his grandmother just passed away. However, right before her death, the grandmother gave the director a `saka`, a legacy-like ghost that is passed down from generation to generation within the family. During the shooting, various strange occurrences happen and Khaty gets possessed by the `saka`.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y8lZCBhxgoKi4VNoplEI4Wm0jyt.jpg", "actors": ["Kamal adli ()", "Kamarul Yusoff ()", "Khatijah Tan ()", "Abam Bocey ()", "Amir Raja Lawak ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "rXI3Z4mebyY"}
