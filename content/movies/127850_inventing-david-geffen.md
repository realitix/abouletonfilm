His far-reaching influence - as an agent and manager, record industry mogul, Hollywood and Broadway producer, and billionaire philanthropist - has helped shape American popular culture for the past four decades. This documentary offers a rare insight into the world of the man responsible for launching the early successes of Joni Mitchell, Tom Cruise, and Guns N\u2019 Roses; co-founded DreamWorks; produced Cats and Dreamgirls;  and is one of the largest contributors to the fight against AIDS. (SBS AU)  Geffen narrates his unorthodox rise from working class Brooklyn boy to billionaire entertainment power broker in extensive interviews.  American Masters explores the highs and the lows in Geffen\u2019s professional and personal life through more than 50 new interviews with his friends, colleagues and clients, as well as other media luminaries.
