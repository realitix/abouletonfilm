Yet another sonic quantum leap forward into infamy, Miss Machine's mind-bending fusion of infectious melody, intrepid arrangements, and immeasurable intensity shattered expectations and silenced skeptics. This limited-edition, specially-priced DVD is a visual documentation of Miss Machine. A collection of behind-the-scenes footage, all the studio videos from the record, and live clips spanning the worldwide Miss Machine tour, Miss Machine - The DVD is an altogether different way to experience this legendary band.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gmybcSQzgPiJZLgHoi08hk6Lwtz.jpg", "actors": ["The Dillinger Escape Plan (Themselves)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
