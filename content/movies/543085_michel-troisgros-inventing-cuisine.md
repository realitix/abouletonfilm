Refusing to bend to fashion, his cuisine is unrestrained and personal, bright and cheerful, making the world-renowned Maison Troisgros resolutely modern even four decades after its inception. This tasty yet minimalist cuisine is echoed in Paul Lacoste's meticulous direction, where the handsome lighting and smart photography make the film a pure delicacy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u8jSp70ifmuT9kPQADHMl2npZYi.jpg", "actors": ["Michel Troisgros (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "wZuHGHkvxCc"}
