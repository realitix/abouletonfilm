The two documentaries are a faithful and realistic portrait of the first decade of Punk in Portugal. This second documentary starts in 1982 with the birth of a second wave \u2013 more combative and involved with the punk scene -  of Portuguese punk bands like \u2018Crise Total\u2019, \u2018Grito Final\u2019, \u2018K\u00fa-de-Judas\u2019, Mata-Ratos or Peste &amp; Sida and ends around 1988. The history is told not only by the musicians but also by anonymous punk\u2019s or even concerned parents. It\u2019s an interesting narration that evolves around music but also around aesthetical, political, educational, legal and ethical dimensions of Punk.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yVnh7bbpXtIH30zD2i6Ug0Zm5gj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "4rGovHkfgRk"}
