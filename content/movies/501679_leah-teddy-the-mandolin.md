From 4 soloists in 2001, the Annual Leah Todres Yiddish Song Festival featured 10 soloists and 120 voices singing in Yiddish on the stage of the Baxter Theatre in 2010. Originally conceived as a fund-raiser for the Cape Jewish Seniors Association, the festival took on a life of its own.  The songs reached out and there was a fascinating re-engagement with both the language and the genre. Enjoy the wonderful songs and engage with the many people whose abundant talent and commitment made the festival possible", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
