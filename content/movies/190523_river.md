As they brave the mighty Mississippi for three weeks on the not-so-trusty Rosemarie, the boys\u2019 journey becomes a cavalcade of hijinks, near death experiences, nautical close calls and impromptu sing-alongs. Featuring an illustrious cast of characters met along the way and wonderful escapades with every dock they make, the film becomes a beautiful and hilarious adventure. Originally released online in weekly episodes, the film quickly became a much-lauded addition to the Ross brothers\u2019 already beloved body of work. This is the first time River has ever been shown on the big screen in its feature version.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/luw2WwcUnQowLXYET573RR9vAtj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
