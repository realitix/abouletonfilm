Much seem missing in the story of poor Ru Yee who applies to be the nurse maid of the Emperor\u2019s son. She gets help to gain access by Wei (Tan Lap-Man) and soon they are both heavily involved inside the palace. She as the nurse maid and he as a eunuch in training. Wei also finds time to murder Ru Yee\u2019s sick husband and child\u2026 a fact barely mentioned after it\u2019s happened.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q0z4npfVI7Xh6jDPbHYJ6RUeFpf.jpg", "actors": ["Ching-Ngo Gam (Ru Yee Niang)", "Tan Lap-Man (Wei Jung Qien)", "Hu Chin (Qau Ar Sau (Royal Mother))", "Charlie Cho (Emperor)", "Cheung Ging-Fa ()", "Ching-Wah Cheung ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
