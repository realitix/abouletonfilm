It wouldn't be such a problem if they didn't work in neighboring retail shops and have to see each other every day. Meanwhile, something weird is going on with the residents of their small town. Some of them are getting sick, others are acting a little less human and a lot more like robots. Can Mona and Jules set aside their relationship drama long enough to avoid the body snatching invaders?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qlo0mWdB6beCh1SyyZLvFfxDzqU.jpg", "actors": ["Julia Mack (Mona)", "Giselle Marie (Jules)", "Jeremy Hovan (Mac)", "Jonathan Medina (Sander)", "Cynthia Johnson (Bianca)", "Juicee Couture (Herself)", "James Pieniaszek (Larry)", "Emily Decker (Nick)", "A.
