Producer and host Caroline Cory, who has her own extensive history with the supernatural, takes the viewers on an extraordinary journey to uncover whether these seemingly independent yet parallel reports may actually be scientific evidence of a greater phenomenon at work. Through a series of groundbreaking on-camera experiments on human DNA, and interviews with leading scientists, viewers will find themselves pondering the nature of their own reality or yet the true origin of the human species. ET CONTACT may ultimately show that the traditionally unexplained is, in fact, far more attributable to science than fiction.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pm80YyAOgOfWFDhgxqwIBSHh8tY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
