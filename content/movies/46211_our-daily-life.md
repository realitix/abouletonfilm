With kindness and gentle humour, the film reveals the relationship between the older and the younger generation. The original concept of a short film study with authentic characters of the Ravager family grew into a feature-length picture on the border between a documentary and fiction. It was made as an improvisation without a previously approved screenplay in the course of only twenty days.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oizjc14zvE7fCYtHAJyJqk0ptm.jpg", "actors": ["Adela G\u00e1borov\u00e1 ()", "Michal Ravinger Jr. ()", "Michal Ravinger Sr. ()", "Marcel Ravinger ()", "Gertr\u00fada Ravingerov\u00e1 ()", "Michaela Ravingerov\u00e1 ()", "Andrej Rimko ()", "Bo\u017eena Slabejov\u00e1 ()", "Karol Toc\u00edk ()", "Silvia Toc\u00edkov\u00e1 Sr. ()", "Silvia Toc\u00edkov\u00e1 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
