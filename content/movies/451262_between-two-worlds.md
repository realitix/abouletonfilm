Fortunately, she didn\u2019t die and ended up marrying a wealthy man, making her hope that life would be better. The film makes the whole chance scenario look like a normal process that can happen to anyone. What a shame. Living it big, she starts to encounter paranormal instances in her new home that somehow has a strange connection to her husband. Bet she didn\u2019t expect that.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cmzGZjFK49M1g4N3hdECZnO8rP.jpg", "actors": ["Dustin Nguyen ()", "Ng\u1ecdc Di\u1ec7p ()", "Mind T\u00edt ()", "Tam Tiet ()", "Dinh Hieu ()", "Dinh Vinh ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
