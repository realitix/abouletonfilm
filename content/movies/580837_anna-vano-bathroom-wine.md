When luck turns its back on him, and the bandits from the bank demand payment, Vano has to start making the wine in the bath of a rented apartment. Starting to press the grapes, he hears the voices of the ancestors and begins to relate to his work with all his heart. And the young wine begins to respond to him. Soon Vano realizes the wine is magical and it starts to affect his life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8k5IbUZo41YwVM3lkpqMeVdXAKB.jpg", "actors": ["Timur Oragvelidze ()", "Arnika Aluri ()", "Roman Slatin ()", "Natalya Pelekhatskaya ()", "Elena Orlova ()", "Denis Smyk ()", "Mariya Nikitina ()", "Vartan Martinyan ()", "Andrey Chirkaev ()", "Ilya Pelekhatsky ()", "Alla Borisevich ()", "Nikita Maltsev ()", "Vasily Solodkov ()", "Angela Pakhobova ()", "Viktoriya Fetisova ()", "Ivan Pityukov ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
