Born in Angl\u00e8s, Spain, in 1908, Remedios was marked by two wars (Spanish Civil War and the Second World War) and for an intense relationship of amour fou with the poet Benjamin P\u00e9ret who considered her his muse and the woman of his dreams. Exiled in Mexico from 1941 until her death in 1963, she developed in this country the pictorial imagery and the technical virtuoso which identify her as a weaver of dreams in a world of medieval reminiscences, populated by creatures and fantastic objects connected with the cosmos.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Juliana Gonz\u00e1lez ()", "Tere Arcq ()", "Alberto Blanco ()", "Alexandra Varsoviano ()", "Walter Gruen ()", "Alan Glass ()", "Leonora Carrington ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
