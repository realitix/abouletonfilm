How far will she go when leaves start to obscure her panorama, her light and her happiness? A brilliant blend of stop-motion, projections and models, drawings and altered live-action transports us into a meditation on the tension between urban life and the natural environment. Like Don Giovanni, will our ambitious protagonist stop at nothing to get her way?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p9CVgGFEcnJMtH49Fb7KpM1mBKr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
