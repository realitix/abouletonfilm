The Red Dog Saloon had its genesis in 1964 when a group of free-thinking, LSD-enhanced Northern California students and young folks had a party and began thinking about starting up a saloon that would evoke the old West. They decided to build their saloon in Virginia City, Nevada, a once prosperous town that was by then nearly empty. The ambience of the saloon blended Old West sensibilities with modern psychedelia, go-go girls and plenty of illegal drugs. The film is comprised of interviews with surviving founders, actual archival footage, and even a performance of some of the musicians who appeared there.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i0sUQRyhmTWYebJ8ek2bPjohOff.jpg", "actors": ["Howard Hesseman (narrator)", "Ernie Fosselius (narrator)", "John Nutt (narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "p_zqBXlW7H8"}
