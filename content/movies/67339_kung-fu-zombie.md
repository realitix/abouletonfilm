But instead of getting his own hands dirty, he hires a Taoist wizard to animate some zombies to do the job for him. The plan goes horribly awry, and the bad guy ends up getting killed in his own trap. This pisses off the villain's spirit and he forces the priest to reincarnate him - only they can't find a suitable body. Meanwhile, an undead fiend of sorts comes to town to kill Billy's father over some other past dispute. This is where all of Billy's kung fu training comes in handy, and he manages to kill the attacker. With this, the other bad guy finally has a body to use, but the reincarnation goes wrong and the corpse is reborn as a vampire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j9OVcPjrA5n0f85NamRGYGJWlZS.jpg", "actors": ["Billy Chong (Pang)", "Chiang Tao ()", "Kwan Yung-Moon ()", "Cheng Kang-Yeh ()", "Chan Lau (Mao Shan Priest)", "Pak Sha-Lik ()", "Woo Wai ()", "Cheng Kei-Ying ()", "Wong Yu ()", "Lin Kuang-Yung ()", "Sam Yan-Chi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
