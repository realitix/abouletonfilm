Since her husband\u2019s death, she has successfully severed all bonds with the people who love her and replaced intimacy with a succession of one-night stands. After a fight with her sister, she drives to Palm Springs to attend a party for her late husband\u2019s parents, whom she still holds dear. On her first night, she meets newly divorced Tim Darnell, who is a saint and the polar opposite of Valerie. They begin a fast and furious romance that fulfills a need each has but ultimately leaves Tim brokenhearted.
