The objects he touches - books, paintings - can be seen as icons of the creative spirit; there is also a motor cycle and film equipment. In succeeding scenes he appears to try on identities offered by institutional doctrines of religion and social traditions of (overt) masculinity. Much of the film was constructed in-camera with a small amount of editing afterwards. An innovation was the use of in-camera fade-outs as phrase markers, not as terminal points, within a single set-up or shot.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u5b02RzdF1CPb59UwGxytazElCn.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Beavers (Eros)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
