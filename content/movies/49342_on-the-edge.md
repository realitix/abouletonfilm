She risks losing her job, going to prison for assault, and she's woefully in love with a bullfighter who may be two-timing her. Carmen, an artist without income, can be manic - snorting lots of cocaine and hanging out with a gay man and a transvestite. What's her future? Hanna contemplates divorce from Abraham, a wealthy momma's boy, and she's disoriented by feelings of attraction to Sandra, a customer at her jewelry store. Can any of these poor little rich girls sort things out in a world of excess?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mAkPHmxhYS4pLqB4CIfFhPGmzK6.jpg", "actors": ["Ana de la Reguera (Luc\u00eda)", "Ingrid Martz (Hanna)", "Gabriela Platas (Carmen)", "Daniel Vives (Manuela)", "Anna Ciocchetti (Sandra Romano - Sara Lee)", "Alejandro Nones (Math\u00edas)", "Rafael Amaya (Gerardo)", "Silvia Carusillo (Pili)", "Martha Higareda (Cristina)", "Roberto Medina (Pap\u00e1 de Luc\u00eda)", "Jos\u00e9 Carlos Rodr\u00edguez (Lic.
