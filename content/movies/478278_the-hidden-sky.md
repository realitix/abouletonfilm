Researching about the possible origins of mankind and specialized in the cosmogony of some people, he manages to obtain some results. He travels to Argentina searching an answer in San Felix, the last afro-descendant community in the country. Hermes provides a unique bridge that will help to recover the memory of a changed history, with the conviction that mankind descended from amphibious beings. But his desire of knowledge will show him how dangerous it is. Director Pablo Cesar specializes in co-productions between Argentina and Africa.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/432xQO20EnWVeMbqBPal3OFiDHu.jpg", "actors": ["Patricio Bedoya (Alejandro)", "Pablo Padilla (Hermes)", "Risto Nghambe (Nahas)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "eBA9MtSO4bs"}
