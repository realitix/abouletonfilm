She's on fire here when teamed with a helping of good old-fashioned man meat, and scorches her way through scene after scene of absolute decadence and debauchery. Look too for Monica Copeland, a natural-bodied wild-eyed sex machine whose perpetually throbbing libido powers her scenes here. She eats her studly co-stars alive and then begs for more. Then there's Carrie Stevens, one of the most under-rated adult film stars of any era, who shines here in all her characteristic multi-orgasmic glory. A stunning treat for the senses, and an especially good look at these highly impressive but too infrequently seen starlets.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/14MmlFSXWie6xwOvDywe5ClKECZ.jpg", "actors": ["Anna Ventura ()", "Sharon Kane ()", "Georgina Spelvin ()", "Lenora Bruce ()", "Tigr ()", "Vanessa del Rio ()", "Sharon Mitchell ()", "Ron Jeremy ()", "John Leslie ()", "Joey Silvera ()", "Jerome Carter ()", "George Payne ()", "Jack Hestor (Plato's Retreat member)", "Paul Ford (Plato's Retreat member)", "Michael Knight ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
