Produced initially for Manchester Olympic Video Festival, the piece juxtaposes nationalistic heraldry and the heroic imagery found in public monumental sculpture, with the bodies of two young Black athletes. Through referencing historical legacies of the disenfranchisement and exclusion faced by Black people, the piece goes on to examine how the transition of the Black athlete from the periphery to the centre of the nations psyche, carries with it a network of contradictions and limitations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4Bv8WbHoigvcu6aWwggxcszGR6e.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
