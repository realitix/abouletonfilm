This film is notable as an early example of a film that violated the Hollywood production code, yet was still shown in the United States, as well as an important film in the genre of queer cinema.  An example of British kitchen sink realism, it was considered daring in 1964 as it touched upon homosexuality, however obliquely.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u9qtXGRktPsrF4cDvgubsYctLcy.jpg", "actors": ["Rita Tushingham (Dot)", "Colin Campbell (Reggie)", "Dudley Sutton (Pete)", "Gladys Henson (Gran)", "Avice Landone (Reggie's Mum)", "Lockwood West (Reggie's Dad)", "Betty Marsden (Dot's Mum)", "Martin Matthews (Uncle Arthur)", "Johnny Briggs (Brian)", "James Chase (Les)", "Geoffrey Dunn (Mr Lunnis)", "Dandy Nichols (Mrs Stanley)", "Carmel McSharry (Bus Conductress)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [43601, 58470], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
