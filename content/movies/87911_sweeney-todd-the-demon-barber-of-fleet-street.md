London's dockside is teeming with ships and sailors who have made their fortune in foreign lands. Sweeney Todd, a Fleet Street barber, awaits the arrival of men whose first port of call is for a good, close shave. For most it will be the last time they are seen alive. Using a specially designed barber's chair, Sweeney Todd despatches his victims to the cellar below, where he robs them of their new found fortunes and chops their remains into small pieces. Meanwhile, Mrs Lovett is enjoying a roaring trade for her popular penny meat pies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6oe9XGUynobN1Z4DTKtGTSJ7Ocq.jpg", "actors": ["Tod Slaughter (Sweeney Todd)", "Stella Rho (Mrs Lovatt)", "Johnny Singer (Tobias Rag)", "Eve Lister (Johanna Oakle)", "Bruce Seton (Mark)", "D.J.
