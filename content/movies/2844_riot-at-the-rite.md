The first performance is the premiere of Igor Stravinsky's 'The Rite of Spring', danced by the Ballet Russes. The rehearsal process is extremely fraught: the orchestra dislike Stravinsky's harsh, atonal music; the dancers dislike the 'ugly' choreography of Vaslav Nijinsky. The volatile, bisexual Nijinsky is in a strained relationship with the much older Sergei Diaghilev, the Ballet Russes' charismatic but manipulative impresario. Public expectation is extremely high after Nijinsky's success in 'L'apres-midi d'un faune'. Finally, 'The Rite of Spring' premieres to a gossip-loving, febrile, fashion-conscious Parisian audience sharply divided as to its merits.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4ZTTp7K1KAbVWKv8IlYFVSvYqa.jpg", "actors": ["Adam Garcia (Vaslav Nijinsky)", "Alex Jennings (Sergei Diaghilev)", "Emma Pierson (Romola)", "Griff Rhys Jones (Astruc)", "Jonathan Aris (Jean Cocteau)", "Christian McKay (Pierre Monteux)", "Richard Hope (Grigoriev)", "Philip Herbert (Antoine)", "Andre Schneider (Ivory)", "Naomi Wattis (Lydia)", "Peter Copley (Patron)", "Sara Dee (Lady Hysteria)", "Zenaida Yanowsky (Ballerina)", "Steve Pemberton (Critic)", "Philip Battley (Bassoonist)", "Rachael Stirling (Marie Rambert)", "Aidan McArdle (Igor Stravinsky)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "p3ArnGRJlt4"}
