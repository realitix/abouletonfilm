Callan Pinckney, author of the revolutionary best-selling exercise book Callanetics (a perennial New York Times Best-Seller), personally demonstrates her innovative deep muscle exercise technique that can literally shed years off your figure in hours without putting pressure on your back. Unlike other exercise programs that stress hard jerking motions, Callanetics is a series of small, gentle, precise motions consistently applied that activate the body's largest, most powerful muscles to quickly tighten hips, buttocks, inner and outer thighs; flatten the tummy; lift the bust and firm underarms and tone the entire body. It will also dramatically improve your posture. You will feel the difference after one hour and most people actually see a difference after two hours. By following the simple 60 minute Callanetics workout twice a week, the body you always dreamed about is only hours away.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tPgM8oL0VVCXwXl5KTiU9xiObgN.jpg", "actors": ["Callan Pinckney (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
