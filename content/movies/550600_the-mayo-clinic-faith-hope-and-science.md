Since then, it has grown into an organization that treats more than a million patients a year from all 50 states and 150 countries. Dr. Mayo had a simple philosophy he imparted to his sons Will and Charlie: \"the needs of the patient come first.\" They wouldn't treat diseases...they would treat people. In a world where healthcare delivery is typically fragmented among individual specialties, the Mayo Clinic practices a multi-specialty, team-based approach that has, from its beginnings, created a culture that thrives on collaboration.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zojyFTrXTdULii1Jh5yHmG0ZTHq.jpg", "actors": ["Kevin Conway (William Worrall Mayo)", "Peter Coyote (Narrator)", "Tom Hanks (Will Mayo)", "Sam Waterston (Charlie Mayo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
