My memories of growing tea mushrooms were foggy - in my early childhood, on a table in the kitchen stood a three litre glass jar with a strange, see-through pancake that floated in brown water. In spite of its appearance, it was a drink that was far superior to all the Coca-colas and Fantas of today. We placed a notice in the newspaper, stating that we were looking for people that still used and grew the tea mushroom. In the end, the project became a notable advertising campaign for the good old tea mushroom - it was in the press, on television and on the radio. A documentary film was made about tea mushroom growers that was screened in a specially organised Tea Mushroom Shop that was set up right in the centre of Riga, where any passer-by could get a free baby tea mushroom in a test tube.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zip2ae1UuGJSFOrsSCn4rMAoluH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
