Steve opens his heart as he tells of childhood ridicule in the 50's, coming out and living openly gay during the decades of the 60s to the 80s- a period rife with homophobia- finding true love, dealing with tragedy and loss, loneliness and aging. His gradual evolution includes embracing sobriety, connecting with a long lost relative and discovering his spirituality only to find that he is in danger of losing his home and business. His entertaining reflections stimulate argument and offer us a refreshing appreciation of life, love and living.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3adQ9fHNOi9VDgMkQ1mV9PddDN3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
