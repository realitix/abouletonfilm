In 1971, he recorded an interview with her that went largely unseen until 2003\u2014Eustache never screened the complete film publicly, although a radically truncated version was presented on television. In a string of long, stationary takes, the camera watches over Eustache\u2019s shoulder while he pours countless glasses of whiskey and Odette tells the stories of her life. A number of her themes resonate with those of Eustache\u2019s films: cruelty, male philandering, the Rosi\u00e8re festival of Pessac. Number Zero is a return to origins\u2014of cinema and of the self\u2014and an experiment in narration, both restrained and deeply personal.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lIFVNbWlbaTuIXoPOVffekU9lHe.jpg", "actors": ["Jean Eustache (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
