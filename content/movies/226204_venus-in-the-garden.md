Nikos and Alain, two male prostitutes and a female pimp, Monica, get tangled in a peculiar relationship after meeting in a dark street called POUTANA. They fall in love, play with guns and talk about card games, money and theatre castings. Is this a game of role playing the three of them have invented to pass their time in a remote, empty summer house? Have they been reading Jean Genet? Whether a mirror image of the characters\u2019 reality or an elliptic depiction of their distorted, dream-like perception of it, I Afroditi Stin Avli, by juxtaposing disparate literary and art references, leads its isolated characters towards dissolution. And yet, in its strange language, it presents this dissolution as a triumph.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hWNdYahZyjxYmuI5cNuoP2Cpzkn.jpg", "actors": ["Athina Mathiou (Monika)", "Alex Vardas (Nikos)", "Stavros Svigos (Alan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "XDujXv-PhJk"}
