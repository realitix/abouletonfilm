He lights upon Nanki-Poo, a strolling minstrel who loves the beautiful Yum-Yum. But Yum-Yum is also loved by Ko-Ko, and Nanki-Poo, seeing no hope for his love, considers suicide. Ko-Ko offers to solve both their problems by executing Nanki-Poo, and an agreement is reached whereby Ko-Ko will allow Nanki-Poo to marry Yum-Yum for one month, at the end of which Nanki-Poo will be executed, in time for the arrival of the Mikado. But what Ko-Ko doesn't know is that Nanki-Poo is the son of the Mikado and has run away to avoid a betrothal to an old harridan named Katisha. The arrival of the Mikado brings all the threads of the tale together", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8cMjvpBjKJZ2xTKLlvOGhszOeuH.jpg", "actors": ["Martyn Green (Ko-Ko)", "Sydney Granville (Pooh-Bah)", "John Barclay (The Mikado)", "Kenny Baker (Nanki-Poo)", "Jean Colin (Yum-Yum)", "Gregory Stroud (Pish-Tush)", "Constance Willis (Katisha)", "Elizabeth Paynter (Pitti-Sing)", "Kathleen Naylor (Peep-Bo)", "Leslie Phillips (Boy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [28480, 80881, 489998, 31515], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
