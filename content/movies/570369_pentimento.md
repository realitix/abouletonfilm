In a belated attempt to connect with her roots, she rushes to the cemetary and joins a funeral gathering. She gets to know the people at the ceremony and is soon embroiled in an art smuggling scheme and has some (probably incestuous) romantic feelings for a young man she believes may be her brother. Eventually she finds out that she went to the wrong part of the cemetary and that these people are not her kin.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e8wRq2vY3i1YJgOy6gTGWpoRlAW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
