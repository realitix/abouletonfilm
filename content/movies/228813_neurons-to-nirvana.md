Strictly focusing on the science and medicinal properties of these drugs, Neurons to Nirvana looks into why our society has created such a social and political bias against even allowing research to continue the exploration of any possible positive effects they can present in treating some of today's most challenging afflictions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iWz85pWapNFcs1jr0d0iZYzjCqT.jpg", "actors": ["Gabor Mate (Himself)", "Julie Holland (Herself)", "Rick Doblin (Himself)", "Ralph Metzner (Himself)", "Charles S.
