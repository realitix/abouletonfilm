There's a dog, a swing, a picket fence, a Big Wheels trike. The grass is green and lush. A soundtrack mixes a chorus, swelling strings, and a child vocalizing. The effect is to idealize the images.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nm255W5evrbZB5UtrqPdouGDVVF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [126189, 126200, 126197, 97517], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
