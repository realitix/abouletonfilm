Inspired by the short films of Maya Deren, Curtis Harrington and the art of Rosaleen Norton and Brett Whiteley, 'Love and the Demonic Psyche' channels French poet Arthur Rimbaud's proclivity for a derangement of the senses, culminating in a Cocteau style blood painting invocating the horned God of Panic. Encompassed in psychedelic visuals and Moroccan trance music, this film should be viewed in the spirit in which it was made.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uCIC16eyywyZMrPADt9iYhG9KWY.jpg", "actors": ["Liam Clark (Poet)", "Amanda Di Maria (Syrinx)", "Jordan Cross (Pan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
