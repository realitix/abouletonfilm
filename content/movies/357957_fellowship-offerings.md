The title of the movie was born there. In the second book of Moses it is written: \" An altar of earth you shall make for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings.\" The people who suffered most in the wars on this territory are the ones that had no influence of what so ever on the development of situation on the Balkan.
