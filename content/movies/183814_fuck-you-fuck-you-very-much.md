She ultimately lost the award to Dilba, and didn't take it very well. The day after, the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet published a story about Leila K peeing on the floor at the award ceremony. Leila K filed a lawsuit against them, and was offered a chance to redeem herself. The documentary also covers how Leila K built her career and stardom, from the beginning with Rob'n'Raz and their world wide mega hit \"Got To Get\" in 1989, up to her second album of her solo career.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1A26ppgu6J72hrmBanzXDkLtmj4.jpg", "actors": ["Leila K (herself)", "Lutricia McNeal ()", "Charlotte Perrelli ()", "Dilba Demirbag ()", "Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus ()", "Per Gessle ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
