This is how Armando meets a pretty young woman with whom he begins a tentative courtship. But soon a rift grows between the siblings and, spurred by Armando\u2019s exaggerated stories about his nascent relationship, Beatriz begins experiencing aural hallucinations that can only be remedied through music and, finally, the love of a stranger. Pinto made this impassioned fairy tale as part of a series of films about the four elements. - FilmLinc", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i8n19y2qer9oOiNbAP8guzWhnaT.jpg", "actors": ["Elsa Batalha (Beatriz Figueira)", "Manuel Wiborg (Armando Figueira)", "Leonor Silveira (Leonor)", "Armando Cortez (Fire Brigade Commandant)", "Cec\u00edlia Guimar\u00e3es (Mrs. Alice)", "M\u00e1rcia Breia (Clara)", "Jorge Silva Melo ()", "Ant\u00f3nio Pires (L\u00e1zaro)", "Lu\u00eds Lucas ()", "Michael Gois ()", "Joseph Ernst ()", "Jos\u00e9 Nascimento ()", "Carla Pereira ()", "Rosa Tengarrinha ()", "Lu\u00eds Miguel Augusto ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
