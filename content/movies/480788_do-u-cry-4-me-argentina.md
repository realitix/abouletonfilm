Soon after Bo-rum's father's illicit clothing factory is raided by the authorities, the displaced worker catches the eye of pretty, former co-worker Duk-Kyu. As the pair set out on their first date to the tourist hot spot of La Boca, the good time that they have together is nevertheless underscored by their relative unfamiliarity with the strange surrounding. From the young, rabble-rousing Koreans who resent the fast-track success of their more industrious fellow countrymen to the second generation that offers hope for the future, this is the story of people trying to find a new life as their identity as Koreans fade and a new breed emerges to forge ahead into an unknown but promising future.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d6shJaQuqcOXuasS6LXRgROwuww.jpg", "actors": ["Kim Borum ()", "Cho Duk Kyu ()", "Bang Hyoun Sik ()", "Cristina Urn ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
