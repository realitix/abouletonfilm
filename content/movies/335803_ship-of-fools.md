He denies all attempts to defend himself. Locked up, he waits for the arrival of \"Caleuche,\" the Ship (Nave) of Fools (de los locos), a mythical figure of his ancestral strength which \"made\" him start the fire. An appointed lawyer (a white woman) comes to the chief's defence, alleging the chief had acted in self-defense as the white man was building commercial structures on the sacred burial grounds of his ancestors, and continued doing so even after heated protests.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/puHE5JXAVGqMBNhHiFYohMMmd7j.jpg", "actors": ["Marisa Paredes (Julia M\u00e1rquez)", "Fernando Guill\u00e9n (Agust\u00edn M\u00e1rquez)", "In\u00e9s Est\u00e9vez (Laura Montero)", "Miguel \u00c1ngel Sol\u00e1 (Dr. Viale)", "China Zorrilla (Dra.
