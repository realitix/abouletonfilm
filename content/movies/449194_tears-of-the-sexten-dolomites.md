Both are sent to the Dolomite front, in order to fend off a threatened Italian attack. Comradeship and loyalty are needed in the fight, but Franz and Peter are ever enemies. Since Peter's romance with Anna, the competition between the two flares up more. But the circumstances of the war and the harsh weather in the mountains soon end those hostilities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c5JaPNROx1LHWJZiVMd3bM77aOG.jpg", "actors": ["Gedeon Burkhard (Parroco Oberrainer)", "Christiane Filangieri (Giulia)", "Thomas Prenn (Franz Anderlacher)", "Jasmin Barbara Mairhofer (Anna Moser)", "Florian Sumerauer (Peter Hartmaier)", "Ricardo Angelini (Tenente Giorgio)", "Anton Algrang (Tenente Fiedler)", "Oliver Pezzi (Karl Wisthaler)", "Martin Perdatscher (Anton)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
