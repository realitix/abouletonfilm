Scott continues to try to be a part of his daughter's life, but when Molly first breaks her arm at the playground then Scott's mother finds mysterious bruises on her granddaughter, Scott again fights for custody of young Molly, and this time he wins because the court feels his family can provide a more stable environment for Molly than a public daycare can.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3uZwCiljPHLI19cKiN6YDnOgHWt.jpg", "actors": ["Keri Russell (Erica French)", "Roberta Maxwell (Cynthia Adams)", "Vince Corazza (Scott Stone)", "Charlotte Sullivan (Annie French)", "Barry Flatman (David Trask)", "Dave Nichols (Matthew French)", "Julie Khaner (Jane Littleton)", "Jill Clayburgh (Susan French)", "Deborah Grover (Barbara Stone)", "Alan Jordan (Al Stone)", "Shelley Thompson (Diane)", "Kristen Holden-Ried (Kevin)", "Mairon Bennett (Carol)", "Nicole de Boer (Nancy)", "Jonathan Potts (Peter Hess)", "John Bourgeois (Lyle Dunham)", "Kim Roberts (Rita)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
