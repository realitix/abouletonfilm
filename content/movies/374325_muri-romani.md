In appearance, it is utter simplicity. For example, the image of a patch of wall in Rome, today. As one watches, the wall seems to change, invisibly, without technical means. The sound is a collage of street sounds: motorinos, bells, people talking, trams, and sirens -- the daily sounds of central Rome.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c7s6HFa0Sl7NpMm7YVJeLFb9jum.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
