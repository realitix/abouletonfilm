They discover a beaten dog (a Bouvier, a large sturdy dog native to Flanders) and adopt it and nurse it back to health, naming it Patrasche, the middle name of Nello's mother Mary, who died when Nello was very young. Nello's mother was a talented artist, and like his mother, he delights in drawing, and his friend Aloise is his model and greatest fan and supporter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4nDUcaWd2ucAgpzbysgw1D2g4r6.jpg", "actors": ["Sakura Tange (Alois)", "Debi Derryberry (Alois (voice: English version))", "Robert Loggia (Nello's Grandpa (voice: English version))", "Brady Bluhm (Nelo (voice: English version))", "Makoto Tsumura (Nello)", "Sherry Lynn (Elina (English Version, voice))", "Ryan O'Donohue (George (Young Child) (voice))", "Scott Menville (George (Young Man) (voice))", "Lara Cody (Paul (Young Child) (voice))", "Richard Cansino (Paul (Young Man) (voice))", "Michael McConnohie (Mr. Cogetz (voice))", "Randall Montgomery (Hans (voice))", "Bob Papenbrook (Ansole (voice))", "Matt K.
