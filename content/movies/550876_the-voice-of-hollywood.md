It's full of then-well-known Hollywood players, identified by name, who run through routines. This one, produced by Tiffany, is not particularly good as people run through canned bits, sometimes without much enthusiasm. Robert Woolsey plays a game a solitaire and it's hard to tell whether his bit was written that way or he improvised it to reflect his feelings.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Robert Woolsey (Himself / host)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
