Older salarymen pay to wait for calls from teenage girls, discreet meetings are arranged, and handfuls of yen are exchanged for a quick session of enjo kosai, or paid sex with a high school girl. Plenty of girls are doing it\u2014some to make money for fancy, fashionable clothes and accessories, others to set a trap to rob and brutalize the old perverts. But the Valentine Call staff, horny young Ogisu and the vaguely sinister, makeup-coated Mr. Kuni, have a nasty plan of their own. Listening in on the enjo kosai calls, they conspire to trick the girls into giving them free sex. Mr. Kuni even has a twisted concept behind this scheme. He calls it enboku, his campaign to humiliate the teenage girls, drive them away from prostitution and purify Japan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jfJMBrPk4V1s8huXKXBoXj7jN2X.jpg", "actors": ["Koharu Toono ()", "Honami Seki ()", "Ayaka Makabe ()", "Jutemu Nakajima (Juteemu Nakajima)", "Ken'ichi End\u00f4 ()", "Taro Suwa ()", "Yoshiyuki Yamaguchi ()", "Mikio Sat\u00f4 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
