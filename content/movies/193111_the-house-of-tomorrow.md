The House of Tomorrow looks for a new approach inspired by the vision of extraordinary women who are changing their own local worlds a step at a time - not by overlooking the conflict but by seeing what people can do despite it.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
