He wasn\u2019t a smooth-talking, charming man. He didn\u2019t have the striking physique of a Greek statue, or the face of a heavenly being. He was normal; but a curse brought on by his father\u2019s infidelity granted him an ability that any man would die for. At first, Peter believes his \u2018touch\u2019 is more of a gift than a curse \u2013 until he meets the love of his life and finds the \u2018blessing\u2019 brings more chaos than he ever imagined.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/U6SpFeKB3jCuIFoYkzYqoDy6fj.jpg", "actors": ["Claude Clark (Peter Wates)", "Amie Ridley ()", "Amie Ridley ()", "T.J.
