His search is for peace of mind and a desire to justify the murder of the girl to himself. His mind becomes distraught as he gropes trying to rationalize his deed and his world falls apart around him. A police inspector patiently and tirelessly stays on Barrault's trail, without putting him under arrest, though convinced he is the murderer, and waiting for the moment when he feels Barrault will break under the strain of his own religious fanaticism (IMDb).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/elHorEjbewPULeJhTMuYg7BpMw3.jpg", "actors": ["Pierre Fresnay (Le commissaire Lavan)", "Jean-Louis Barrault (Francis Ferriter)", "Viviane Romance (Molly)", "Louis-Jacques Boucot (Monsieur Kelly)", "Mady Berry (Madame Kelly)", "Alexandre Rignault (Le docteur O'Leary)", "Ludmilla Pito\u00ebff (La tante de Th\u00e9r\u00e9sa)", "Alla Donell (Th\u00e9r\u00e9sa Burke)", "Georges Flamant (Callaghan)", "Pedro Elviro (Un agent de la S\u00fbret\u00e9)", "Charblay ()", "Jean Tissier ()", "L\u00e9on Bary ()", "Pierre Labry ()", "Marcel Dela\u00eetre (Le pr\u00eatre)", "Marthe Mellot (Madame Ferriter)", "Genevi\u00e8ve Sorya (La gourgandine)", "Edmond Van Da\u00eble ()", "Paul Asselin ()", "Maurice Maillot ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
