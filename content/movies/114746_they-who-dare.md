And that\u2019s about it really, oh of course there\u2019s problems along the way such as questions of loyalty, hazards and set-backs such as minefields, and talking \u2013 lots of talking - as the men stand or sit around pondering the war and or - their own inadequacies etc. When the big action finale comes it is kind of worth the wait, but the performances are only adequate throughout and the script is lazily written to the point of tedium setting in. 5/10"}], "recommandations_id": [426976, 161780, 249313, 146814], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
