Alone in her Montmartre apartment, Sellam enjoys the little things in life. As we listen to her muse about her life as an astrologer, Sellam moves through her daily routine: making her morning coffee, watering plants, putting on makeup. Each segment is narrated by Sellam or the filmmaker herself, slowly constructing a dual portrait of two very different but equally charming women. In the restrained formalist style of Chantal Akerman and with the deeply personal approach of Agn\u00e8s Varda, Sofia Bohdanowicz presents a unique voice that confirms her as a strong observer and artist of the everyday. Maison du Bonheur is an experimental documentary rich in personal details, intelligent in its narration and playful in its tone.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bfmKm79z75CYQpqU9kxG0WNS3iG.jpg", "actors": ["Juliane Sellam (Herself)", "Albert Eddassouki (Himself)", "Manouk Kurdoghlian (Himself)", "Claude Tougard-Lumbroso (Herself)", "Pierre Tougard (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "bInvPokMFH4"}
