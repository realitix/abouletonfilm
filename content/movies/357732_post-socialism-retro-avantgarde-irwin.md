The disintegration of the concept of ideology means that notions are no longer clear. Because we think that we are outside an ideological context, but perhaps we ourselves are the centre of the ideology.  It is this idea that corresponds with the thoughts about post socialism in the nineties, and probably the post ideological society of late capitalism as well. The end of the ideological period then perhaps seems imminent. These thoughts are considered in this philosophical media reflection, based on documentary fragments, statements by Peter Weibel and Slavoj Zizek and the works of three artists: Mladen Stilinovic (Zagreb), \"Kasimir Malevich\" (pseudonym, Belgrade) and IRWIN (Ljubljana).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aMueJa6nvjK7s6yGXXYgSgt1bxb.jpg", "actors": ["Milena Zupan\u010di\u010d (Herself)", "Jernej \u0160ugman (Himself)", "Slavoj \u017di\u017eek (Himself)", "Peter Weibel (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
