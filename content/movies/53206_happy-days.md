The music of the movie- which is cheerful when played fast and sorrowful when played gently- is perfect.. Just as perfect as those people in good old times and as the life they represent. The act is so natural that you either find yourself shed tears or laughing as loudly as you can. Every little detail is so fascinating. I do not know what more to say about this film, but it is certainly worth watching again, again and again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y8nlACgsbMBn0k0WrmaOzGgKmTO.jpg", "actors": ["M\u00fcnir \u00d6zkul (Kazim)", "Adile Na\u015fit (Saadet)", "\u015eener \u015een (Ziya)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [69610, 69319, 65010, 123612], "youtube_key": "pSP3KQxQWD8"}
