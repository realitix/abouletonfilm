Both the Massai of Kenya and the Ovahimba of Namibia have spent centuries as cattle farmers. With their lands being turned into protected game reserves, these ancient tribes have turned to tourism as a means of survival. While some environmentalists think that community-based conservation is ideal for these villagers, the dangers of drought and the starvation of their cattle remains a constant reality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/L6jiDOr4puHXuML9OK4Sh2JRGS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
