Vittaya is forced to take care of his friend's son, Tong Kam. As a young man, Tong Kam falls in love with Vittaya's daughter Porn but Vittaya prefers Trai, a civil engineer who came to their village to coordinate the building of a dam. When the dam was completed, the village flooded and Wittaya was tasked with clearing every tree, including a big Ta-Kian tree. As he set about his task, awful events began to befall everyone close to him, including his daughter who became a permanent sleeping princess. Wittaya decided to re-plant the tree stub again in order to appease the soul of Ta-Kian and hopefully break the sleeping spell on Porn. However, hidden threats still lurk in the forest.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xcCucVdBGvc5599Veg2f5F1PZlT.jpg", "actors": ["Sorapong Chatree (Khamnan Witthaya)", "Nuntawat Arsirapojcharnakul (Kham-Thong (as Nantawat 'Tor' Asirawat))", "Piphat Apiraktanakorn (Trai)", "Rungrawee Barijindakul (Ta-Kain)", "Arthittiya 'Mint' Dithiiphen (Porn)", "Wanvisa Nakatae (Nor-Sueng)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
