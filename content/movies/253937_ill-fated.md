Lewis's tragic-comic adventure ILL FATED plunges the viewer into the boxed-in world of Jimmy, a small-town teen who seeks a better life but who sees dead-end signs at every turn out of town. His vague plan to leave and \"look into college\" is complicated by a revolving door of small-town complications - the demands of his lumpen best friends, his troubled girlfriend, his promiscuous stepmother and cuckolded stepfather. But the biggest complication of all is the return of his womanizing biological dad Earl, who'd fled in Jimmy's infancy after impregnating the wife of a violent convict (also his best friend). Earl's return is a catalyst to disaster, and a palette for director Lewis to paint a hyper-realist picture of small-town dystopia.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dK1AiMDkeqtXstlbeuIPWpD9lED.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Outerbridge (Earl)", "Paul Campbell (Jimmy)", "John Callander (Bobby)", "Nicki Clyne (Barb)", "John F.
