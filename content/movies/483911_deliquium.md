From that first fascination\r And it\u2019s lascivious gaze,\r Came the gorged desire for substance,\r Among the skins,\r Nets, shadows and milk bottles\r Pried from the stomachs of metal fish,\r Steam, smoke and things that won\u2019t stay,\r Speared, dangled, measured, divined.\r All dreamed through wallpaper,\r Or dowsed from something they drowned in long ago.  Snowed in on either side,\r The swans,\r L\u00edr\u2019s beloved children,\r Begin their 800 year journey.\r From lake to sea\r A thousand more.  \u2013 JM", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
