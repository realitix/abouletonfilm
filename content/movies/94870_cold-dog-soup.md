All the boy wants is to dispose of his date's dead dog Jasper and get back to the babe who's so hot she mutters darkly about being a Pressure Cooker: his conventional efforts are continually thwarted. Quaid is respected by the peculiar groups he interests in the dog's corpse and effects, and our one-gloved heroine is much keener on him than on her rather lackluster date.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xl3ckep3NLyEzlprI4GIfCDt7FF.jpg", "actors": ["Randy Quaid (Jack Cloud)", "Frank Whaley (Michael Latchmer)", "Christine Harnos (Sarah Hughes)", "Sheree North (Mrs. Hughes)", "Nancy Kwan (Madame Chang)", "Dante Basco (Chinese Boy)", "Peter Pan (Chinese Chef)", "Pierre Epstein (Marty)", "Jeff Chayette (Herschel the Guard)", "Allan Trautman (Joseph)", "Allen Bloomfield (Irving)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
