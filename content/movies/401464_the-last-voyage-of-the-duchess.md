Launched by Rickmers boatyard in 1902, the four-masted training barkentine carried saltpetre from Chile and wheat from Australia to Europe. She won the \u201cgreat grain race\u201d between Down Under and Europe a total of eight times for her Finnish owner Gustaf Erikson. In 1936, she completed the voyage between Wallaroo in South Australia and the English port of Falmouth in just 86 days. But she was never to make it back to her home port. Leaving Falmouth in rough seas and a dense fog, she ran into cliffs and started taking on water. The barque\u2019s last trip was also the honeymoon of captain Sven Erikson and his new bride, journalist and writer Pamela Bourne. Under the watchful eye of the international press, they undertook incredible efforts to save the ship.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1Me3aLHmtkXNiU8ck6M6y72cupG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
