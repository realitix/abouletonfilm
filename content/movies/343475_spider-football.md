The construction vocational school holds a name-giving ceremony, thus calling the attention of its supervisory organ to itself. The school-master distributes as well as receives presents from the sponsoring factory, and the pupils sit for a written examination of unheard-of material. The results are devastating, which the despotic school-master attempts to conceal by a staged disciplinary procedure.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ypy5TmFOGsLLSOM8G81zvjstv5j.jpg", "actors": ["J\u00f3zsef Madaras (Igazgat\u00f3)", "Rajhona \u00c1d\u00e1m (Lengyel P\u00e1l)", "Hal\u00e1sz Judit (Lengyeln\u00e9,\u00c9va,magyartan\u00e1r)", "R\u00f3bert Koltai (Tornatan\u00e1r)", "P\u00e9csi Ildik\u00f3 (Pelik\u00e1n anyuka)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
