With this new Blu-ray transfer, hopefully it can stay in print long enough for fans to gobble it up, for it most certainly is a feast worthy of a Waltz King Richard Strauss. Elisabeth Schwarzkopf is a near-perfect heroine in this poignantly comic look at aging and starcrossed lovers. Though this is not a flashy production, it's of such inestimable historical value, and presents this opera in such a glorious performance, that it's easy to overlook some of the technical issues of this Blu-ray. Highly recommended.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r1aHa3y8C27PHqxx5uJvv7bHrbn.jpg", "actors": ["Elisabeth Schwarzkopf (Marschallin)", "Sena Jurinac (Octavian)", "Otto Edelmann (Der baron Ochs von Lerchenau)", "Erich Kunz (Herr von Faninal)", "Anneliese Rothenberger (Sophie)", "Judith Hellwig (Jungfer Marianne leitmetzerin)", "Renato Ercolani (Valzacchi)", "Hilde R\u00f6ssel-Majdan (Annina)", "Herbert von Karajan (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
