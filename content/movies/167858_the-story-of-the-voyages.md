A kindly, wise philosopher-type by the name of Orlando joins Marta in her search, and together they survive a gigantic sleeping dragon and imprisonment in a tower with no clear means of escape. They overcome that hurdle, but later on, Orlando succumbs to the evils of The Plague (an all-consuming woman!) and Marta continues on her search alone. Eventually, she does find her brother -- but that only introduces problems she had never considered.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lxOrDCC4UuGDd72HnOp3F8jnKJK.jpg", "actors": ["Andrey Mironov (Orlando)", "Tatyana Aksyuta (Marta)", "Lev Durov (Kidnapper)", "Vladimir Basov (Barrister)", "Venyamin Smekhov (Don Quixote)", "Carmen Galin (Plague)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [84821, 49580, 165095, 68797], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
