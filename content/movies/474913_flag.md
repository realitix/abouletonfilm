She assembles a patchwork of scenes around discrepancies between democratic rhetoric and the reality of racial exclusion, mingling a child's diary entries, stills and home movies, printed texts, street interviews with people attempting to define the meaning of the American flag, and a medley of physical routines in which idiosyncratic dance movements collide with stylized variations on saluting. \"Flag\" flickers with the uncertainties of memory, the evocation of a child's credulous view of equality tempered by an adult knowledge of social hierarchy and oppression. -- Paul Arthur", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
