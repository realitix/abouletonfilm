I wouldn't have thought her voice would be so well suited to Violetta Val\u00e9ry in La Traviata, and it does take some getting used to, but I think she at least brings a distinct quality to the role with an emotional heart that isn't always necessarily there when a leading diva uses it primarily as a display for her vocal talents. It's served well also by Antonio Pappano's conducting of the Royal Opera House Orchestra in a traditional, but effective production by Richard Eyre.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wfCzTq9ROwNwyGEqt4mED96mL2n.jpg", "actors": ["Ren\u00e9e Fleming (Violetta)", "Joseph Calleja (Alfredo)", "Thomas Hampson (Giorgio Germont)", "Monika-Evelin Liiv (Flora)", "Eddie Wade (Douphol)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
