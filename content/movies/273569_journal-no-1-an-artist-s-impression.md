Fifty years later, after the collapse of the Communist bloc, this newsreel was lost in the confusion of the fighting in Yugoslavia. In Journal No. 1 Hito Steyerl attempts to find out how the footage got lost and what was on this document from the Sutjeska studio. In the simultaneous projection of Journal No. 1 the \u2018unattainability of an historical zero hour of the national identity\u2019 takes concrete form: The lost newsreel reports on a literacy campaign as well as Muslim women confidently removing their headscarves. We listen however to eyewitnesses trying to recapture the lost content and we see the artist Arman Kulasic making a number of drawings that resemble the story-boards for the lost film. What appears to be moments of great change remain limited by subjective and uncertain memory.  The film was premiered at documenta 12.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lMs4uVivvcmvICiJOkFC11DGtyZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
