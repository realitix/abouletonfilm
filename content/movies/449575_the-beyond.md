Most Sci-Fi uses technobabble as a plot device to move the story along while The Beyond features many nonsensical monologues of nothing but technobabble. If you have even a passing interest in space travel, cosmology, Maxwell's Rainbow, or just general science; you may find much of the dialog to be bordering on word salad.\r\nCamera direction is inconsistent and perplexing. Sometimes the camera is steady as if on a tripod, but even when it should be steady, such as a local news crew doing a man-on-the-street interview or a camera affixed to the outside of the space station, the camera shakes and swerves around like you're watching Cloverfield or The Blair Witch Project."}], "recommandations_id": [428948, 468320, 436494, 455847]}
