I Will Live With Your Memories revolves around an obsession: a soundless scene discarded from that film becomes the engine for this new incursion by the director into the secret life of Ada Falc\u00f3n, the early secluded and isolated singer, forgotten by everyone but a handful of compulsive aesthetes. Ada is no longer among the living, and those silenced words have become an enigma. The film is a poetic investigation on the possibilities of cinema when retrieving truth to the things we see on the screen, and reminds viewers of the power of persuasion of the image, that sensible magma where the dead dance and find their voices back.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8HmOIKiWQfFRJtg4ZFuWzKnDU32.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
