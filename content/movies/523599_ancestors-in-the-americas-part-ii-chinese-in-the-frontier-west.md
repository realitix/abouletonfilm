Their landmark legal battles to overcome discrimination helped to develop U.S. civil rights law, setting key precedents and expanding the definition of what it means to be an American.  This two-part series presents the history, challenges, and lasting impact of early Asian immigrants to the Americas, from the 1700s to the 1900s. The series follows their little-known journeys and stories, reveals their pioneering struggle against racial hatred and for basic rights, and depicts their lasting cultural, legal and economic contributions to the building of the Americas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eyVA1KjlnXcKS1KBYi6faX3TJfc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
