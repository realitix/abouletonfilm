He likes them, but he wants them tattooed. To this end, young Osayo has herself decorated with a celebrated flying-angel pattern and in this way brings much pleasure to her patron. A young hoodlum named Shinnosuke also covets the tattooed maiden. He, decorated with the design of a famous thief, finally gets to her and she responds as she rarely does with her older lover. Also in love with her is a young girl named Okimi who has herself tattooed with a courtesan design just to please the older woman. Having done so, however, she becomes fair prey to the tattoo-loving Tonomura who loses no time in seducing her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oEXJnehM76K7gSITHHygDfV7Ayq.jpg", "actors": ["Chizuko Arai (Osayo)", "Y\u00fbsuke Kawazu (Shinnosuke)", "Kikko Matsuoka (Okimi)", "T\u00f4ru Abe (Tonomura)", "Yuko Minakaze ()", "Chikako Miyagi (Fusa)", "Eiji Okada ()", "Akimitsu Takagi (Doctor Fukuhara)", "Mina Aoe (Woman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
