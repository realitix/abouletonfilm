Be careful about the genre because you have to realize that it's not a movie packed with action, instead it's a thriller packed with suspense.\r\n\r\nI find myself rating this picture with a solid 7 out of 10. In my opinion there's an evident issue with its contents. It's a movie that can be split in three very distinctive parts: it starts off really well, after a while we face a pretty long boring part (which lasts about 25/30 minutes), and then everything gets extremely better.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing wrong with the main plot, actors are great and each and every soundtrack is pretty enjoyable. Conclusion: it almost made me cry, it's something worth watching!\r\n\r\n_(7 stars out of 10)_"}], "recommandations_id": [408381, 364433, 340945, 335578], "youtube_key": "hzUj42eaHEc"}
