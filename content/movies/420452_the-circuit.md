Whilst the other guests, ex-Bananarama member Marty, Angie, who 'makes bullets' and the supposedly suicidal Danny are affable enough, Nat and Gabe are shocked by their hosts' very public rows and Gabe's attempt at peace-making is awkwardly received. Nat is taken aback when virtual stranger Helene confides in her about Sasha's suspected infidelity and Gabe is rudely rebuffed when he tries to have a heart to heart with Sasha. After Helene physically attacks her husband the newcomers are desperate to leave but when Danny drops a bombshell Gabe is torn between responsibility and the easy way out.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1RQ3nfQjMRWabhWYAZPVIDERnCK.jpg", "actors": ["Adeel Akhtar (Gabe)", "Eva Birthistle (Nat)", "Tobias Menzies (Sasha)", "Victoria Hamilton (Helene)", "Desiree Akhavan (Angie)", "Nicola Walker (Marty)", "Paul Ready (Danny)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "I0QKCHuasZc"}
