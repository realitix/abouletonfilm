One of his assignments was to accompany journalists visiting the Soviet Union to make sure they did not discover the truth about Soviet life. After becoming disillusioned with the oppressive system, he escaped to the West at great risk to his life. In this interview, conducted by G. Edward Griffin, Mr. Bezmenov tells how the Soviets used propaganda against their own citizens; how he hoodwinked American journalists into publishing Soviet propaganda, how slave laborers are concealed from foreign visitors, and how he escaped to the West posing as an American hippie. Includes many photographs brought with him on microfilm at the time of his escape.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ohYsm782JZLv0SVMcLbu3ckvLhp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
