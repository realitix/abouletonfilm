Dave Grohl (Foo Fighters), Britt Daniel (Spoon), Ryan Adams, No Age, Craig Finn and Tad Kubler (The Hold Steady), Margaret Cho with Grant Lee Phillips, and Jessica Dobson (The Shins, Deep Sea Diver) all performed songs from Bob's historic catalog. Until now, only the 2,265 concert attendees have seen these amazing performances. Fortunately, the entire evening was captured in stunning audio and high-quality video quality by filmmaker Justin Mitchell.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vDzs243pICYUYRgmXuIl3SlYQGy.jpg", "actors": ["Bob Mould (Himself)", "Dave Grohl (Himself)", "Margaret Cho (Herself)", "Matt Pinfield (Himself)", "Jon Wurster (Himself)", "Ryan Adams (Himself)", "Britt Daniel (Himself)", "Jessica Dobson (Herself)", "Craig Finn (Himself)", "Tad Kubler (Himself)", "Grant-Lee Phillips (Himself)", "Randy Randall (Himself)", "Dean Spunt (Himself)", "Butch Vig (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
