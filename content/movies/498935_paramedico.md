The camp, military style of Pakistans rescue teams, with their marching and theatrical disaster exercises are a world away from the relaxed beachside work of the Hawaiians who stop for ice-cream at every turn.  On the other side of the globe, above the romantic canals of Venice, ambulance doctors and nurses watch a generation of old Venetians quietly die as tourists pass below.  Meanwhile, Mexican paramedics put their mind off the terror of the countrys drug war with their on-station games and madcap antics.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nTcaSCUJlArfrbuxrGySDOLAjBn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
