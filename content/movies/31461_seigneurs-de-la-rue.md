And all these movies were of poor quality that promoted them as DMX films (while he was usually only in them for about one scene and just a meer shadow of his former acting self).\r\n\r\nAnd this is one of these movies.\r\n\r\nWhile other ones like DEATH TOLL were just excrutiatingly awful, this is more or less as bad BUT this comes with the advantage of ocassionally  being laughably bad so it does at least entertain somewhat on some level so in that sense it's better.\r\n\r\nBut yeah don't expect this  to be good (it's not) and don't expect to see X for more than a minute. At least they didn't lie about Kris Kristofferson being one of the leads so there's always that, and he is the only person in the film that does make this movie remotely watchable."}], "recommandations_id": [32010, 16032, 14142, 10026], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
