But, to his surprise, he learns his brilliant idea's not exactly original; there are other residents who dodge the night watchmen, and who keep their existence secret at all costs. And one of them is a young woman who wants to leave, but is to frightened to go. And Charles finds that he wants to show her the larger world outside.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bGp9Ur5f4ORibe1FDkaEQn2tPC6.jpg", "actors": ["Anthony Perkins (Charles Snell)", "Charmian Carr (Ella Harkins)", "Dorothy Stickney (Mrs. Monday)", "Larry Gates (Roscoe Potts)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
