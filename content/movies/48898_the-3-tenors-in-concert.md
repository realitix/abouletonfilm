It's all of these and none of them. Once you accept the fact that this sequel to the original blockbuster concert recording is less about music and more about entertainment and the power of musical personalities, you can appreciate what you're hearing as an event--phenomenal and bizarre, momentous and frivolous. This is an occasion to celebrate the voices and egos of three huge superstars, and to have fun listening as Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo, and Jose Carreras interact, bouncing lines off each other and playing to the overwhelmingly enthusiastic audience.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cHmnzlyFPIzdsN7bqRDfxUc0zdI.jpg", "actors": ["Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (Himself)", "Luciano Pavarotti (Himself)", "Zubin Mehta (Himself - Conductor)", "Lalo Schifrin (Guest Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
