Commissioned to mark the arrival of the 2014 Tour de France in Yorkshire, the film makes full use of stunning British Film Institute footage to transport the audience on a journey from the invention of the modern bike, through the rise of recreational cycling, to gruelling competitive races. Award-winning director Daisy Asquith artfully combines the richly-diverse archive with a hypnotic soundtrack from cult composer Bill Nelson in a joyful, absorbing watch for both cycling and archive fans.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mdCr0DaBmWBU0k1auI3BaDoFu46.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
