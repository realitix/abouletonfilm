He is in love with Urania, a widow, whose stingy husband Sotiris is over a year dead, as the ship he was sailing in, sunk. When Sotiris appears, explaining that he was hiding so as to get the life insurance money. Urania, who already has a love affair, convinces Thomas to murder him, pretending she is in love with him. Thomas indeed tries unsuccessfully. Everything is revealed when Sotiris discovers that the insurance money have been stolen and appears screaming during his memorial service. A trial ensues, where Thomas admits that he is not only an imbecile but 'an imbecile and a half'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h4iXWxlA4IYNZpSCcgUQHL5Qb0.jpg", "actors": ["Christos Efthimiou (Thomas Katsaros)", "Dionysis Papagiannopoulos (Sotiris Karamaounas)", "Andreas Barkoulis (Tonis Karamitsos)", "Giannis Gionakis (Perlepes)", "Rika Dialina (Ourania Karamaouna)", "Marika Nezer (Mrs. Theodora)", "Aleka Stratigou (Anthi)", "Kostas Papahristos (Anastasis)", "Stavros Xenidis (photographer)", "Nikos Fermas (Giorgis)", "Lavrentis Dianellos (Mr. Spanakis)", "Aggelos Mavropoulos (judge)", "Giorgos Velentzas (policeman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [367431, 332064, 394074, 377031], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
