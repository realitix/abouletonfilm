To recruit new followers for his kingdom of darkness he sends out Karishika, queen of demons, to the world of the living. There she misguides and seduces a number of people, who all fall prey to her because of their own shortcomings. All but the last fall for the temptation of either the fulfilment of their desperate wishes, or money, or sex. The last, a pastor, resists all temptation and is saved from hell through divine intervention in a final showdown between a Pentacoastal congregation and Karishika and her helpers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lS74GSUlo3yWUdqEOddvaVgLo3S.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "yCh0CuKzryQ"}
