It's her only dream and reason of life to hang her pictures in a gallery. However, unlike her expectations, the world doesn't recognize her talent and only forces unreasonable compromise. She continues everyday with resentment and pain from the world. Chang-min (Park Jae-jeong) has a special talent which allows him to feel a person's feelings; he feels her pain and pities her. He was born with a gift he didn't ask for and has experienced abandonment from his loved ones. He feels love for Soo-yeon and so does she. Meanwhile, Soo-hyeon is given a dangerous offer to compromise with authority if she wanted to see light as an artist.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wmHXU6OPhtorfWkaq23ktSru2TW.jpg", "actors": ["Go Eun-ah (Soo-yeon)", "Park Jae-jung (Chang-min)", "Ju Min-ha (Mi-ra)", "Song Eun-jin (Eun-ji)", "Ahn Yeo-jin (Cameo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
