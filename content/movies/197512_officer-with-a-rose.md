Matilda is a wealthy widow of a war hero and has an apartment so spacious that she is required to take a boarder. Fortunately for her, the handsome young Lt. Horvat, the communist housing officer, has taken a fancy to her and has assigned his fiancee to be Matilda's new roommate. Where Matilda is soft and rounded, Lilijana is hard, skinny, and given to revolutionary pronouncements rather than tender endearments. The lieutenant loves them both, though he naturally finds Matilda more attractive. His situation is simplified when Lilijana, though pregnant, is transferred to another post. However, his commander is horrified that he has a lover in addition to his fiancee and demands that he choose whether to continue his career or continue his affair.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gMq2nHnYMSEojSwd1BKeNN4PsjE.jpg", "actors": ["Ksenija Paji\u0107 (Matilda Ivan\u010di\u0107)", "\u017darko Lau\u0161evi\u0107 (Petar Horvat)", "Dragana Mrki\u0107 (Ljiljana Mati\u0107)", "Vicko Rui\u0107 (Mate Mrki\u0107)", "Boris Buzancic (Franjo Gostru\u0161ki)", "Slavko Juraga (Stipe)", "Zvonimir Torjanac (Seljak)", "Lena Politeo (Slu\u017ebenica)", "Sven Medve\u0161ek (Partizan koji sprovodi Matildu)", "Andrea Bakovi\u0107 (Ljerka)", "Vida Jerman (\u017dena koja \u010duva djecu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
