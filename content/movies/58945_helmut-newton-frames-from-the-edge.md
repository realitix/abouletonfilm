He's on the go from L.A., to Paris, to Monte-Carlo, to Berlin, where he was a youth until he escaped from the Nazis in 1936. We see him on shoots, interviewing models, and discussing his work.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/10TTsmAGLQxfaiKo3vxxlcrLBsn.jpg", "actors": ["Helmut Newton (Himself)", "Catherine Deneuve (Herself)", "Faye Dunaway (Herself)", "Charlotte Rampling (Herself)", "Sigourney Weaver (Herself)", "Karl Lagerfeld (Himself)", "Candice Bergen (Herself)", "Adrian Maben (Himself - Narrator (voice))", "June Newton (Herself)", "Robert Evans (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
