Filmed over the course of 1 day from sunup to sundown.  Constraint:\r Each individual shot in the iPhone cut (filmed and edited one month prior) was timed and each location mapped. Because the film was edited sequentially in-camera, physical movement through space was required in mimicking the cuts of the digital version - an unfolding of montage in real environments. The iPhone movie was constructed so as to form a map, the 16mm film is the traversing of the points plotted. Periodic shots of empty skies mark the passage of time through color.  The film\u2019s digital counterpart has been deleted.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sUee5cZebF50zG39jjXGrizWYqe.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "9w8fhpRe5Is"}
