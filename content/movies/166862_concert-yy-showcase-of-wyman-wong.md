These star-studded concerts featured Wyman's best works, chosen from his extensive repertoire by the man himself, and performed by over 40 guest singers - from the hottest stars to the very rare appearances like Amanda Lee, Shine, and Cass Phang - who showed up in designer costumes under the fashion-savvy lyricist's direction. Now you can relive such a sumptuous feast for the senses that is Concert YY on this 3-Blu-ray set, complete with 88 songs and a total running time of over six hours!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iquAFpirA9r27ClLyY8zY1n9QrX.jpg", "actors": ["Wyman Wong Wai-Man ()", "Ekin Cheng ()", "Sammi Cheng ()", "Andy Hui ()", "Amanda Lee ()", "Edmond Leung ()", "William So ()", "Jeff Chang ()", "Bondy Chiu ()", "Anthony Wong Yiu-Ming ()", "Eason Chan ()", "Candy Law Lum ()", "Juno Mak ()", "Fiona Sit ()", "Cass Phang ()", "Miriam Yeung ()", "Wilfred Lau ()", "Daniel Chan Hiu-Tung ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
