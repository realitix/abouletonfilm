When he gets out of Vridslose State Prison, Kjeld and Benny have become associates of Yvonne's cousin Georg from America. He is not just some old-fashioned strongbox thief that can't remember like Egon, but a young hip IT criminal, that thinks that everyone else is inferior. However, Egon doesn't take lightly to the Georg's patronizing so he sabotages Georg's computer and ruins his cup. This time Egon's ambitions reaches a new high, when he and his gang break in to the World Bank, and they get away with it. Of course, thanks to Yvonne, they aren't rich very long.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4mJt3FnpwUgPAndhwGUc2aP6mSx.jpg", "actors": ["Ove Sprog\u00f8e (Egon Olsen)", "Morten Grunwald (Benny Frandsen)", "Poul Bundgaard (Kjeld Jensen)", "Claus Ryskj\u00e6r (Georg)", "Paul Hagen (Mester Hansen)", "Ove Verner Hansen (B\u00f8ffen)", "Axel Str\u00f8bye (Kriminalassistent Jensen)", "Dick Kays\u00f8 (Politiassistent Holm)", "Karl Stegger (Vagtmand i Verdensbanken)", "Holger Juul Hansen (Fahrlehrer Larsen)", "Bj\u00f8rn Watt-Boolsen (Holm-Hansen)", "Kirsten Walther (Yvonne Jensen)", "Arthur Jensen (Parkeringsvagt)", "Alf Andersen (Hallandsen)", "Pouel Kern (Afg\u00e5ende vagtmand)", "Birger Jensen ()", "Ejner Federspiel ()", "Bjarne Adrian ()", "Niels Alsing ()", "J\u00f8rgen Beck ()", "Edward Fleming ()", "Poul Thomsen ()", "Solveig Sundborg ()", "Ernst Meyer ()", "Holger Vistisen ()", "Holger Perfort ()", "Sisse Reingaard ()", "Magnus Magnusson ()", "Kirsten Hansen-M\u00f8ller ()", "Otto Leisner ()", "Ole Andreasen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [15537, 11392, 12592, 15499], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
