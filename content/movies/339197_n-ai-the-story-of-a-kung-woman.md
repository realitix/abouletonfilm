N!ai tells her own story, and in so doing, the story of Ju/'hoan life over a thirty year period.  \"Before the white people came we did what we wanted,\" N!ai recalls, describing the life she remembers as a child: following her mother to pick berries, roots, and nuts as the season changed; the division of giraffe meat; the kinds of rain; her resistance to her marriage to /Gunda at the age of eight; and her changing feelings about her husband when he becomes a healer. As N!ai speaks, the film presents scenes from the 1950's that show her as a young girl and a young wife.  The uniqueness of N!ai may lie in its tight integration of ethnography and history. While it portrays the changes in Ju/'hoan society over thirty years, it never loses sight of the individual, N!ai.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ranCclR3qIWpixflVHY80toS4yX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
