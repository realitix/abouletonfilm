Each frame is printed twice, so that its effective speed (at 24fps) is 12 frames per second. A variety of organic and crystalline painted shapes (painted on clear leader, thus as if brilliantly back-lit in a blazing space of light) are interspersed with very dark (black leader) passages as if etched with scratches of light and stained radiances. There are also some straight, multi-colored, bars which move, diagonally from one side of the film frame to the other. All these \"themes\" finally give way to clear thick gelatinous effects which resolve themselves in a long passage of hieroglyphic white shapes in a black field, ending on a brief spate of variable coloration.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/40duCxitoApeMBupnhYAoZjewHO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [383841, 285768, 262854, 166712], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
