There's not much substance to this drama of all round dysfunctionality, but the well chosen cast are excellent, the script is intriguingly naturalistic (and at times inconsequential), and the direction often virtuoso: not merely in the use of music and the skilled exploration of the characters on the confined train, but in a stunning final shot swooping over a huge cemetery.\r TimeOut,  GA", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
