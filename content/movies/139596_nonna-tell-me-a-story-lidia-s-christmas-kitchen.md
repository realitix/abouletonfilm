Instead of the elaborately-decorated Christmas trees and presents of today, Lidia shows her grandchildren how she and her family would bring in a fragrant juniper bush and decorate it with edible ornaments (along with the recipes for those edible ornaments). It is a beautiful message of family traditions, not being wasteful, and appreciating nature.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ehfqbki3jFdK6GVAjFNCaViuZvT.jpg", "actors": ["Lidia Bastianich (Herself)", "Brigid Harrington (Julia)", "Michael Terra (Lorenzo)", "Tony Terraciano (Ethan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
