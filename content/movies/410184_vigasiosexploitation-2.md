A pig-tailed girl with tape across her nips that\u2019s dressed like an 80s leather bar-frequenting gay man named Osso escapes prison. Skipping down a dirt road, she\u2019s psychokinetically frozen by a boobed Grim Reaper and told to become the leader of an invisible motorcycle gang. Meanwhile, it\u2019s hinted that earth has been struck by an asteroid, changing its overall climate to that of a desert. Weirdly, a mirror planet dubbed Arret from another dimension overlapping our own is faced with the opposite problem. As such, a Dr. Moreau attempts to raise money for a \u201ctime gate\u201d he theorizes will open a doorway between the two worlds. That way, he and those he presumes to be super-intelligent beings can pass through it to help each other resolve their climate issues. Oh, and he secretly hopes to establish a race of super-people who don\u2019t eat, sleep or reproduce by mating with Arret\u2019s inhabitants.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6HKMp1Uwq6EPch6UvHbTt1y73Wb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
