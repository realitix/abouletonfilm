The concept is conceived in the musing: who took the photograph that washed out a frame of this film? A hybridization of mediums and tools (8mm, 16mm, optical printer) are used to investigate the camera flash that washed out a frame in the hopes of uncovering a hidden emotion. A meditation on equipoise is addressed in the guided evolvement and retraction of light on the optical printer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7gaQvHoMDz8Ztb3g0tJ32j5A5VA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
