The manner of their deaths, the radicalness of their slogans (they were the first overtly anti-American statements to be heard in public since the conclusion of the Korean War) deeply shocked Korean society at the time. Twenty years have since passed. The world has changed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/thFzYRgdErL3e87FQ2Zh6Cx9MDD.jpg", "actors": ["Kim Eung-soo (Interviewer/Interviewee)", "Jeon Ho-sik (Interviewer/Interviewee)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
