The story shows a superb and foul-mouthed golfer that, after several tries, fails to hit the ball and is furious with his caddy, an innocent-looking boy who faithfully obeys the orders of his employer, despite the abuse to which he is submitted. Unsurprisingly, being a joke, it ends up with a shot funny surprise, obviously not to be revealed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3VOWCbxr3jMjYNmkXBiuQ4AhgER.jpg", "actors": ["Guillermo Jacubowicz  (Caddy)", "Tony Lestingi (Golfista)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "_dCx3hFuvtQ"}
