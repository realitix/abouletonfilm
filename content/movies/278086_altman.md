Innovator. Storyteller. Rambler. Gambler. Mad man. Family man. Director. Artist.  Robert Altman's life and career contained multitudes. This father of American independent cinema left an indelible mark, not merely on the evolution of his art form, but also on the western zeitgeist. \"Altman\", Canadian director Ron Mann's new documentary, explores and celebrates the epic fifty-year redemptive journey of one of the most important and influential filmmakers in the history of the medium.  With its use of rare interviews, representative film clips, archival images, and musings from his family and most recognizable collaborators, Mann's Altman is a dynamic and heartfelt mediation on an artist whose expression, passion and appetite knew few bounds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1ErP6Lo3kkz9UzfMCoX1rAz9xYt.jpg", "actors": ["Julianne Moore ()", "Bruce Willis ()", "Paul Thomas Anderson ()", "James Caan ()", "Keith Carradine ()", "Elliott Gould ()", "Lily Tomlin ()", "Philip Baker Hall ()", "Robert Altman ()", "Sally Kellerman ()", "Lyle Lovett ()", "Michael Murphy ()", "Robin Williams (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [49645, 83891, 268536, 253105], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
