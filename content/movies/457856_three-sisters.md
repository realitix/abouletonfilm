In Anton Chekhov\u2019s play the heroines are aged around 25; now they are 55. What does that do? The heroes\u2019 retorts, stylistically inappropriate from today\u2019s twenty-year-olds, are absolutely organic for the older generation, the \u2018Soviet\u2019 intelligentsia. The problems of Chekhov\u2019s classical work concerning the search for a meaning in life, the loss of ideals, the fear before death without having achieved anything in the world, the desire to be useful to others \u2013 all these things are also a typical attribute of the Soviet intelligentsia.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n89O0DROq0xrp4bgZ6HgEsrGHDZ.jpg", "actors": ["Lyudmila Polyakova ()", "Anna Kamenkova ()", "Irina Mazurkevich ()", "Maksim Sukhanov ()", "Aleksandr Baluev ()", "Aleksandra Nazarova (Anfisa, nanny)", "Igor Korovin (abbe)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
