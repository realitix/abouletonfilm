He loves Musetta, in his home town of Naples, and then Dorothy, the daughter of one of the Metropolitan Opera's patrons. Caruso is unacceptable to both women's fathers: to one, because he sings; to Dorothy's, because he is a peasant. To New York patricians, Caruso is short, barrel chested, loud, emotional, unrefined. Their appreciation comes slowly. The film depicts Caruso's lament that \"the man does not have the voice, the voice has the man\": he cannot be places he wants to be, because he must be elsewhere singing, including the day his mother dies. Throughout, Mario Lanza and stars from the Met sing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sYccnU6cAx7XFq4FGUOk6HwALvJ.jpg", "actors": ["Mario Lanza (Enrico Caruso)", "Ann Blyth (Dorothy Benjamin)", "Dorothy Kirsten (Louise Heggar)", "Jarmila Novotna (Maria Selka)", "Richard Hageman (Carlo Santi)", "Carl Benton Reid (Park Benjamin)", "Eduard Franz (Giulio Gatti-Casazza)", "Ludwig Donath (Alfredo Brazzi)", "Alan Napier (Jean de Reszke)", "Blanche Thebom (Vocalist - Opera Montage)", "Teresa Celli (Vocalist - Opera Montage)", "Nicola Moscona (Vocalist - Opera Montage)", "Giuseppe Valdengo (Vocalist - Opera Montage)", "Lucine Amara (Vocalist - Opera Montage)", "Marina Koshetz (Vocalist - Opera Montage)", "George Chakiris (Dancer (uncredited))", "Mae Clarke (Woman (uncredited))", "Bess Flowers (Front Row Audience Member at 'Lucia di Lammermoor' (uncredited))", "William Ripley Dorr (Vocal Ensemble (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [126805, 62722, 26166, 65991], "youtube_key": "nwhEc75Ktq0"}
