Rodgers' contribution to musical theatre was extraordinary, including 900 published songs, 40 Broadway musicals and several film scores.  Rodgers, together with lyricists Lorenz Hart and later Oscar Hammerstein II, wrote many of the best known musicals of the 20th Century, including Babes In Arms, Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I and The Sound of Music.  This performance at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, directed for the stage by Simon Callow, includes songs, dance, staged numbers and anecdotes featuring leading stars from both Broadway and London's West End.  The cast comprises luminaries drawn from Oklahoma!, Kiss Me Kate, Chicago, The King and I and other recent productions as well as from television.  This musical extravaganza features many of Rodgers' best-loved classics.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9bfBW7YXhEliIqbMHzl4mlzT5wH.jpg", "actors": ["Ruthie Henshall (Performer: 'My Funny Valentine')", "Dave Willetts ()", "Judi Dench (Performer: \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\")", "Gillian Anderson (Performer)", "Sally Burgess (Performer)", "Kim Criswell (Performer)", "Lesley Garrett (Performer)", "Maureen Lipman (Performer)", "Claire Moore (Herself)", "Josie Lawrence ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
