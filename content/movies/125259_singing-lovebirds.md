She is in love with another r\u014dnin, Reisabur\u014d Asai, who lives next door, but he is being pursued by two of the town beauties, Otomi and Fujio. To make things even more difficult for Oharu, her father is obsessed with antiques, buying them even though he has little money and even when most of them eventually turn out to be fakes. A mistake, however, puts him deeply in debt to the local lord, Tanbanokami Minezawa, and he is confronted with having to sell Oharu in order to pay it off.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iRTYySO514qNmrM2jb2KkQ1Z55d.jpg", "actors": ["Chiez\u00f4 Kataoka (Reisaburo Asai)", "Ry\u00f4suke Kagawa (Soshichi Kagawaya)", "Takashi Shimura (Kyosai Shimura)", "Mitsuru Toyama (Man-emon Toyama)", "Kaj\u00f4 Onoe (Roku-be of Dogu-ya (antique dealer))", "Hidemichi Ishikawa (Matsusuke Matsuda)", "Eizaburo Kusunoki (Sugiura)", "Ryutaro Chikamatsu (Hinokiyama)", "Matsunosuke Fukui (Takebayashi)", "Minoru Fujisaki (Yanagawa)", "Shir\u00f4 Osaki (Tsubaki)", "Mitsuo Kobayashi (Sankichi)", "Heizaburo Fujimura (Young master of charcoal shop)", "Daihachiro Takebayashi (Young master of grocer)", "Junosuke Arashi (Young master of liquor shop)", "Makitaro Bando (Young master of rice shop)", "Sanpei Ishimaru (Young master of dry food shop)", "Sh\u00f4jiro Kawase (Medical doctor)", "Haruyo Ichikawa (Oharu (daughter of Kyosai))", "Fujiko Fukamizu (Fujio (daughter of Man-emon))", "Dick Mine (Minezawa Tanba-no-kami)", "Tomiko Hattori (Otomi (daughter of Kagawaya))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
