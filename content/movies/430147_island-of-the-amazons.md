While out there, Manuel's father has found a crashed airplane carrying gold ingots. Manuel goes to the mainland to tell of his father's finding and is overheard by a gangster. The gangsters head over to the island and shoot Manuel's father, but Manuel escapes. Murdok captures some of the girls, who must fight off some of the gang members' evil intentions.
