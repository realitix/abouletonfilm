He has dominated the V8 Supercar landscape over the past two decades. He is a five-time Australian Touring Car/V8 Supercar champion, and in 2007 he eclipsed the great Peter Brocks record for the most number of championship round wins. He is also a five-times winner of the Bathurst 1000 only Larry Perkins, Jim Richards and Brock have won more Bathursts. But few drivers can match Skaife for versatility, for he was also highly successful in openwheelers - the only driver to win Bathurst, the touring car championship and the openwheeler Gold Star title all in one year.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yjyhGJnHtZi2tQ47gtLam1jjctK.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Skaife (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
