Only the nastiest car accidents, suicides and murders are here; faithfully and explicitly documented through actual crime scene investigations by police and emergency response teams from around the world. Everything you see is real; nothing has been faked. There are no boring autopsies or old World War II footage. Only the best and bloodiest corpses killed within the past 10 years are good enough to become the FACES OF GORE! If you cannot handle smashed brains, bug-eyed corpses and char-boiled fetuses, then DO NOT WATCH THIS DVD! Nothing you have ever seen before can prepare you for this breakthrough new horror film by TODD TJERSLAND, the Visionary Overlord of American Horror!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4EMuX0MrypCueGjlC7Vi91BGObN.jpg", "actors": ["Todd Tjersland (Narrator)", "Steve Sheppard (Dr. Vincent van Gore)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
