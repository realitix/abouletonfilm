It could have something to do with the lack of shopping days left on the calendar, but Howard is betting that his recent visit to a medical testing facility is more likely to blame. Before he can find out what he took and how to stop it, he'll need to go toe-to-toe, or fist-to-teeth, with every bloodlusting living thing between him and quiet spot to put a plan together.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Adam Conger (Howard Phillips)", "Matt Iseman ()", "Justin McCaffrey (Homeless man)", "Tony Nunes (Teddy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
