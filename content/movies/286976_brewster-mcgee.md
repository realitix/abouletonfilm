With a simple story about Brewster McGee (Brent Neale) a profane loser who sits outside in a Chicken Hut parking lot with his gentle hippie accomplice Malcolm (Reid Edwards) trying to turn his big plans into reality. Brent Neale who plays Brewster McGee does a good job in letting the audience feel a twisted compassion for his unlikeable character as he takes advantage of pathetic, heartbroken Oliver and thinks up impracticable get rich quick schemes. The film which was shot in 16mm black and white and with such a low budget (50,000 dollars Canadian) this small independent film did what it could with money restraints and yet still has more heart and soul than most blockbuster movies. Though it's not perfect, I assure you its worth while to see and entertains the open eye with its intense dialogue and creative plot."}], "recommandations_id": []}
