We see a solitary man and a solitary woman, each alone with their thoughts. She is in the country, staring out a window. Nature is quiet, waiting for spring, trees are bare. He is in the city, walking from the docks, watching, somewhat aimless. She walks a country lane. Both are alone. She writes him a letter, offering an opportunity. Will he take it?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qfoCOEEdUlbSyedDl68Naknyd63.jpg", "actors": ["Erna Bergman (Erna)", "Willy Hildebrand (Fred)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [146816, 203100, 128939, 159245], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
