The actual filmic material related closely to that used by Gidal in previous films: hand-held shooting in domestic interiors, with tight framing, frequent zooms and re-focusing, aspires to a kind of 'pre-predicative' flux, in which full representation is held in abeyance. However, this material is now fragmented by the regular interruption of black leader, so that it appears as a series of discrete segments which are not, in any syntactic sense, shots - single takes clearly extend across more than one segment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9eSWadkrGVkKHXDwKQwKArt0ZBg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
