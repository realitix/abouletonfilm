The Blues Brothers were an unforgettable part of Saturday Night Live's golden era, making their musical debut in bee costumes singing \"I'm a King Bee,\" and becoming an overnight sensation. Switching to hats and shades inspired by John Lee Hooker, they combined classic Chicago Blues with Stax-Volt R&amp;B to create a sound all their own. Their first album, Briefcase Full of Blues, went double-platinum and led quickly to their hit movie and milestone soundtrack album. The rest is history, and it's all here in a music-filled, memory-blasting account of a band that will always be on a mission from God.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/irSTCD16t0iNYO6t4RR6JQ7E8tP.jpg", "actors": ["John Belushi (Jake Blues (archive footage))", "Dan Aykroyd (Elwood Blues / Himself)", "Steve Cropper (Himself (archive footage))", "Donald \"Duck\" Dunn (Himself (archive footage))", "Murphy Dunne (Himself (archive footage))", "Steve Jordan (Himself (archive footage))", "Tom Malone (Himself (archive footage))", "Lou Marini (Himself (archive footage))", "Matt Murphy (Himself (archive footage))", "Alan Rubin (Himself (archive footage))", "Paul Shaffer (Himself (archive footage))", "Tina Bockrath (Waitress)", "Ellen Cleghorne (Sabrina (voice))", "Tom Davis (Interviewer (uncredited))", "Tom Scott (Himself (archive footage))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
