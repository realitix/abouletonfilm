The party\u2019s great success is generally regarded as a result of its leader\u2019s demonic charisma. But this film doesn\u2019t focus on J\u00f6rg Haider. Instead it gives a face to the people who make Haider\u2019s election victories possible, taking a clear stance, yet refraining from commentary or judgement. It is up to the viewers to draw their own conclusions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qgArbBdDBFTRUa13tB6UDdLlJPz.jpg", "actors": ["J\u00f6rg Haider (Himself)", "Heide Schmidt (Herself)", "Christian Schneider (Himself)", "Herbert Sch\u00fcrz (Himself)", "Peter Westenthaler (Himself)", "Franz Berger (Himself)", "Peter Sch\u00f6nerklee (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
