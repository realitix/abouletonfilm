I do not own the license to the IP or the characters in any way. This was made as a labor of love for my fans. The content is owned by Universal Studios and TellTale Games.  It's not a true Back to the Future 5 (V) but it's a good consolation prize. It goes way beyond merely having all the cut scenes in a row.  To fully experience this film you must have seen the original Back to the Future trilogy as well as Part 4. Enjoy!\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bfsvaTKxDZb4ENwCyQU6wHEKXl8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
