Although the original play was set in an unspecified, but distant past, the film relocates the story to modern day India. The film tells the story of a Bengali merchant from Kolkata and his servant who visit a small town for a business appointment, but, whilst there, are mistaken for a pair of locals, leading to much confusion.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Uttam Kumar ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
