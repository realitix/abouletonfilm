Wreath, a 24 year old mama's boy, is forced to leave his house to find a job by his mother. In this effort to find employment, he accidentally hits the first trace of zombie in the apocalypse, a zombified girl by the name of Sarah . Wreath takes care of the zombie in secret whilst feeding it and eventually falling in love with it in his garage. In a different light, a trio consisting of a girl named Stella and her two contesting love interests, Josh and Brendan find themselves trapped in a provincial park amidst the zombie invasion, struggling for survival. And last but not least, two stoners, Carl and Reggie venture on a vacation up a mountain to escape the looming apocalypse only to find themselves on the trail of a strangely agile zombie clown who will stop at nothing to devour the brains of them both.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/71UFIgLRQyLRmnLG99BBbuYnprO.jpg", "actors": ["Willie Knauff (Josh)", "Sam Mountenay (Brendan)", "Rosi Hunter (Stella)", "Scott Legault (Reggie)", "Alexa Houle (Clown Zombie)", "Zo\u00eb Hadeler Lund (Sarah)", "Kyle Brogan (Wreath)", "Connor Desharnais (Carl)", "Cassidy Clayton (Wreath's Mother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "uR5Ffs2ZIkc"}
