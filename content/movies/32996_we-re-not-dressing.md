She makes her way to an island with the help of singing sailor Stephen Jones. Her friend Edith, Uncle Hubert, and Princes Michael and Alexander make it to the same island but all prove to be useless in the art of survival. The sailor is the only one with the practical knowhow to survive but Doris and the others snub his leadership offer. That is until he starts a clam bake and wafts the fumes in their starving faces. The group gradually gives into his leadership, the only question now is if Doris will give into his charms.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e5ONZob2x6xT8wVIHWgUcaNzGK0.jpg", "actors": ["Bing Crosby (Stephen Jones)", "Carole Lombard (Doris Worthington)", "George Burns (George Martin)", "Gracie Allen (Gracie Martin)", "Ethel Merman (Edith)", "Leon Errol (Uncle Hubert)", "Ray Milland (Prince Michael Stofani)", "Jay Henry (Prince Alexander Stofani)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "talisencrw", "content": "I love older movies, but have hesitated on seeing my boxed sets of Bing Crosby's films (and for the time being have actually stopped for a while) simply because of his caustic comments about David Bowie from when they sang the Christmas standard 'The Little Drummer Boy' together late in his life, and the supposedly awful way he treated his seven children (two of whom actually committed suicide). Still, this was enjoyable for non-Crosby elements, such as Carole Lombard and the antics of the fine comic duo of Gracie Allen and George Burns--not to mention a cool early appearance by Ray Milland."}], "recommandations_id": [42814, 42342, 43601, 20127], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
