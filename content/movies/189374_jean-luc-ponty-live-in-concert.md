Earlier in his career, the violinist became enamored with the use of banks of synthesizers plus digital delay for special effects on his instrument, as well as the prominent presence of an electric guitarist. But this quintet, heard in a brilliant 1999 concert in Warsaw, is considerably stripped down, featuring keyboardist William Lecomte, electric bassist Guy Nsangu\u00e9 Akwa, drummer Thierry Arpino, and percussionist Moustapha Cisse. A perfect example is \"Rhythms of Hope,\" first recorded for Ponty's album Mystical Adventures; Ponty's dazzling solo is followed by Akwa's intricate, yet never excessively flashy bass solo.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qIem2k50eMByBHgz8LZ87AVCasT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
