Ganesh, the protagonist, is a potter who leads a happy and contented life in a remote village. The only ambition he and his wife Kurjan share is to get their only son Laxman married and bring a daughter-in- law home. Destiny, however, has ordained otherwise. Ganesh is hand picked for his honesty and dedication by a local charitable Seth to become the caretaker of his inn in the middle of the desert. There, Ganesh and Kurjan meet a wealthy couple, who are greatly pleased with their service and hospitality. They offer to take their son Laxman to distant lands, teach him trade and make him fabulously rich.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wuls89Sy9ZU9Rb2aj01zYKtWATk.jpg", "actors": ["Basant Josalkar (Ganesh)", "Surekha Sikri (Ganesh's wife)", "Sudhir Kulkarni ()", "Sharda Desoares ((as Sharda D'Soares))", "B.D.
