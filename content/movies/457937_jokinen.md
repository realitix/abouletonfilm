{"tmdb_id": 457937, "title": "Jokinen", "original_title": "Jokinen", "slug_title": "jokinen", "date": "2017-02-10", "genre": [""], "score": "7.0/10", "synopsis": "Moving somewhere between historical research, a detective story and an arts and crafts club, the film is based on documentary research. However, it is unconventional, both in terms of form and narrative structure. Jokinen is constructed from newspaper and book quotes as well as the artist\u2019s own narration. Since the piece directly cites texts from the 1930s, it uses some language that is offensive from today\u2019s perspective. By exposing a story from the 1930s, the artist asks whether there are any similarities in the present and the past.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bynidonQz2rVUmlH5ZZuH40GhdQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
