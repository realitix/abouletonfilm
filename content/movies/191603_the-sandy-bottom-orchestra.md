The Greens share musical aspirations, but daughter Rachel (Madeline Zima), a talented violinist, is the one most likely to achieve them. Norman (Tom Irwin) is a dairy farmer and Ingrid (Glenne Headly) is a choir director who abandoned the piano when she married and settled down, but the Greens are a happy family, for the most part. The trick is finding a way to reconcile their dreams with a reality that may hold more riches than they realize. When Norman gets a chance to conduct the local orchestra for the Dairy Days celebration, it's an opportunity for the family to come together, not just with each other, but with a community they had never fully appreciate", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qa94dmJ4HZngKlwRCvJyep32bfR.jpg", "actors": ["Glenne Headly (Ingrid Green)", "Tom Irwin (Norman Green)", "Madeline Zima (Rachel Green)", "Jane Powell (Delia Ferguson)", "Richard McMillan (Jim Sykes)", "Roger Dunn (Mayor Broadbent)", "Elizabeth Lennie (Angie Wyman)", "Tamara Hope (Carol Wyman)", "Lindsay Murrell (Valerie)", "Shadia Simmons (Jenny)", "Wendy Lyon (Mrs. Erickson)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
