They're hindered by a snowstorm, but make it none the worse for wear, warming themselves by a fire they help stoke. They play and sing some songs, and then a chaotic dinner ensues. This is followed by more singing and dancing, and a good time is had by all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zJLmIy2DLq2gVWqGlzCkhlJthD5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
