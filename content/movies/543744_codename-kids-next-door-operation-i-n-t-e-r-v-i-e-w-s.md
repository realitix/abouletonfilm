It all started with a routine mission to get the Delightful Children's birthday cake, but when a mysterious boy steals it instead, he makes it available to whoever wants it, IF they can solve his 'simple' scavenger hunt first. Soon it's a mad, mad, mad, mad chase around the world as the KND, their friends, and virtually all of their enemies compete to win the yummiest cake ever", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Ben Diskin (Nigel \"Numbuh One\" Uno (Voice))", "Ben Diskin (Hoagie Pennywhistle \"Numbuh Two\" Gilligan Jr. (Voice))", "Lauren Tom (Kuki \"Numbuh Three\" Sanban (Voice))", "Dee Bradley Baker (Walloby \"Numbuh Four\" Beatles (Voice))", "Cree Summer (Abigail \"Numbuh Five\" Lincoln)", "Maurice LaMarche (Father)", "Ric Stoneback (Adult Hoagie)", "Sonnie Brown (Adult Kuki)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
