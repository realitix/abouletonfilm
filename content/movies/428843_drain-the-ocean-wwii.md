World War Two left a great number of ships and submarines hidden beneath the waves. Now, as the oceans drain, each vessel reveals its secrets through new data-based 3D reconstructions. From the Arizona in Pearl Harbour\u2019s shallows, whose destruction brought America into the war, to Nazi super ship the Bismarck and its mysterious end three miles down. From the flaming merchant ships secretly torpedoed by U-boats off tourist beaches of the USA, to the covert inventions of the Allies' costly D-Day beachhead, and lastly to the troopship Leopoldville sunk with the needless deaths of 400 soldiers. Drain The Ocean exposes the truth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z8A5ZrIcDWrua4fmHqqxUvfGPny.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
