Railroads traverse these mountains by way of scenic routes and steep grades. Put winter and railroads together, and the result is something special: mile long freight trains braving white flurries, passenger coaches on mountain excursions, and small operators battling the elements. This is a Western Winter Wonderland.  Featuring:  Stevens Pass, Marias Pass, Mullan Pass, Deer Lodge Pass, Canadian Rockies, Donner Pass, Shasta, McCloud, Pengra Pass, and Port of Tillamook Bay Railroad.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iKPqFxpJO6FDNqukBDdZuyHmzM4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
