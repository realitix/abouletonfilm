Profound, spiritual and hallucinatory, Palms is remarkable at every level and one of the most visionary films of recent years.  Narrated by the director addressing his unborn son, the film is compassionate, revelatory and bold in its originality and was awarded the NIKA (Russian Oscar) for Best Documentary in 1994. This is its first-ever release on DVD.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3BVwfTZVa6p7JcLWenBrkfa6xp6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [168994, 218233, 130241, 47238], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
