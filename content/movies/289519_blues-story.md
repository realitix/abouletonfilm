Combining exclusive interview and performance footage with vintage clips and the music of many Blues legends long gone, the history of this richly felt music is illuminated - from its African roots to its American urban expression - along with its profound place in our cultural heritage. The result is a rare, first-hand glimpse into the lives of these vanishing artists, and a moving, insightful and informative look into a music that continues to be loved by millions throughout the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lHgskPCioTe8fkRzTqL5IlQSQBc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
