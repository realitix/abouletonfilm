This style of tattoo is very painful and she prefers not to do it this way. She also has a habit of mixing in some snake venom into the ink she uses for tattooing. This can cause some interesting and sometimes lethal side-effects whenever her clients are in the heat of passion. In other words, you do not want to mess with Soo-na. Now she has a new client, Ji-soon, who is very persistent in wanting her to use the stitchery tattoo technique. Soo-na gives in and agrees to finish the tattoo of a Medusa on his back. She quickly learns that behind the Medusa lies a dark secret that has ties to her own past. What follows is a tale of revenge, murder, and tattoos.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aJzSwnCOWonLpOcoHau9adTtzUj.jpg", "actors": ["Song Il-gook (\ud55c\uc9c0\uc21c)", "Yoon Joo-hee (Jo Soo-Na)", "Kwon Hyun-sang (\uc624\ucc9c\uae30)", "Seo Yeong (\uad6c\ucc0c)", "\uc774\ud638\uc5f4 ()", "Han Gi-joong ()", "\ud64d\uc9c0\uc740 ()", "Han Je-in ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "SJOXhIiWP3c"}
