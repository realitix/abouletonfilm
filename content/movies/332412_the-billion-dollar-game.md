Schools from larger conferences like the SEC and Big East didn\u2019t see the need to keep allowing the mid-major teams into the Big Dance. They always lost, so what was the point? When Alonzo Mourning\u2019s no. 1 seed Georgetown Hoyas entered the tournament, they had their eyes set on the Final Four and a national title. Dealing with the likes of Ivy League champion and no. 16 seed Princeton was more of an afterthought. So when these two teams faced off on March 17, 1989, in Providence, Rhode Island, no one, not even Princeton, expected much of a game. They were all wrong. Pete Carril\u2019s Tigers not only played one of the greatest games in college basketball history, they also let the NCAA and the rest of the world know that the mid-majors could play and were here to stay. Without that game, the tournament would not be what it is today \u2014 a billion-dollar enterprise that stops America for two weeks each year.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dyJtweSjo5uxUmKWUbojFYem7vQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
