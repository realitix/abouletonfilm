Each carried an 8mm camera into battle and they still had their film. \"Mein Kreig\" alternates between interviews with these older men, now apologetic, philosophical, or defiant about their participation, and the footage they shot. It's chronological: basic training, the train trip East, roof-top vistas of war-torn Warsaw, peasants in Belarus, the downing with carbine volleys of a Russian plane, winter, a holiday at the Black Sea, mud, impassable roads, death, destruction and retreat. \"Home, that was the front,\" one says.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7f7Su0RgLp3zGnIy5z5EIB1MwV7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
