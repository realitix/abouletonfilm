The film collects samples from the land-and-soundscape, underscoring in the process the oft-ignored industrial underpinning of our latter-day culture. Also native to eastern Switzerland is VOICE CRACK, the everyday household electronics duo of NORBERT MOSLANG and ANDY GUHL, whose musical workings are explored as part of Liechti s vision. Whether clicking quietly and rhythmically or humming and shrieking at ear-splitting volume, their recycled electronics produce innovative sounds and provide an appropriate accompaniment in this cinematic search for the detritus of our culture, the lost and destroyed remains of the last century of progress.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pYVXbDy3rX9ve9CmC9dBlyJzdR7.jpg", "actors": ["Norbert M\u00f6slang ()", "Andy Guhl ()", "Knut Remond ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
