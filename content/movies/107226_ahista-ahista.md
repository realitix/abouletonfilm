Women are not welcome, but their birth is. Subbalaxmi is thrilled when her pet protege, Sangeeta, gives birth to a baby-girl, who they name Chandra. Shortly thereafter they relocate to a small community. Sangeeta wants Chandra to study, and she is allowed to do so. Chandra meets her neighbor, Kunal, and their family, and is welcomed by them. Problems arise, when Kunal and Chandra fall in love, as neither Kunal's family, nor Chandra's courtesan family will permit this marriage. Only time will tell if Chandra's fate is to be the same as other courtesans.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xLhKeMpSyyrgEiGRLxrqgrKV2h8.jpg", "actors": ["Ashalata (Kaveri)", "Suresh Chatwal (Patron)", "Aruna Irani (Savitri)", "Kunal Kapoor (Kunal)", "Shammi Kapoor (Sagar)", "Kader Khan (Patron)", "Padmi Kolhapure (Chandra)", "Shashikala (Subbalaxmi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
