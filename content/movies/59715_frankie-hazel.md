Barton is Frankie and Ingrid Uribe is Hazel, Frankie's neighbor and best friend. Frankie is an orphan who lives with her imperious grandmother, Phoebe (Joan Plowright), while Hazel lives with her father and older brother. Frankie's mother was a prima ballerina--killed in a car crash along with her father--and Frankie's been following in her toe shoes ever since. Although she's the best dancer in her class, she'd rather play baseball, whereas Hazel's a local activist who'd rather be mayor. The story strains credibility when 13-year-old Hazel runs for office against the middle-aged incumbent, but Frankie's goal is more understandable, and both actresses make their characters sympathetic and believable. It's as hard not to like them as it is not to root for them to succeed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rZO15Hi8v6eD0o5NZoBj8wkN9uw.jpg", "actors": ["Joan Plowright (Phoebe Harkness)", "Mischa Barton (Francesca 'Frankie' Humphries)", "Ingrid Uribe (Hazel Perez)", "Richard Yniguez (Antonio Perez)", "Richard Yniguez (Carlos Perez)", "Anthony Marquez (Carlos Perez)", "Michael Kopsa (Coach Anhault)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
