In his class, Ivan is provoked by a student and ends up slapping him on the face. In Serbia, in the heat of transitional changes, Ivan\u2019s presence in school is no longer welcomed. He finds a temporary job opportunity in a war-scarred mountain village in Bosnia.  On his way there, he meets Yasmina, a young Muslim woman, back from Germany to her homeland after the war and after being invited by an old friend \u2013 Hazim - who now runs a motel.  A lone kiss in a stormy night, in a village still lying in ruins, will bring Yasmina and Ivan closer together in a joint escape from reality and to a ride on a dusty bus, where neither one of them wants to sit next to the window.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vFGO4nKBq9WKmiYEl13UoE1ymFP.jpg", "actors": ["Dragan Mi\u0107anovi\u0107 (Ivan)", "Nikolina \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 (Jasmina (as Nikolina Djordjevic))", "Zijah Sokolovi\u0107 (Hazim)", "Nikola Pejakovi\u0107 (Domar)", "Mladen Nelevi\u0107 (Direktor skole)", "Ljubivoje Tadi\u0107 (Profesor matematike)", "Dragana Nenadic (Profesorka)", "Milo\u0161 Pjeva\u010d (Ucenik)", "Olivera Viktorovi\u0107 (Sankerica)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
