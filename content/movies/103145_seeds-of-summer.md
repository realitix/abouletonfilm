Over the course of 66 days and nights, Lasker shoots a fly-on-the-wall documentary that allows unprecedented intimacy into the lives of the trainees and commanders of the Israeli army. The dichotomy of the innocence of these baby-faced trainees with the heavy burden of military service is a central theme of the film, illustrated in a scene where they discuss losing their virginity while waiting their turn to fire a machine gun. But it is the director\u2019s relationship with Smadar, a breathtaking commander struggling to mask her gentle soul with a strict military persona, which makes the film truly enchanting. The intersection of love, duty, and personal growth thrive through to the film\u2019s surprisingly moving finish.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bC70n7wOrU2SCoowWaVEOQZzqdy.jpg", "actors": ["Hen Lasker (Herself)", "Yarden Nir (Herself)", "Smadar Gilad (Herself)", "Lotem Boiem (Herself)", "Karim Lapidot (Herself)", "Nizar Hassan (Herself)", "Naomi Azar (Herself)", "Sarah Sweiry (Herself)", "David Nimrodi (Himself)", "Robert Pik (Himself)", "Jill Pik (Herself)", "Osnat Trabelsi (Himself)", "Liora Lasker (Herself)", "Reuven Lasker (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "4y8BUK6VYy4"}
