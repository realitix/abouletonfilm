Despite living in the middle of the digital age, this heretical director hailing from the snowy plains of Canada has spent 25 years transposing the uncommon and the uncanny onto screens over-saturated with naturalistic imagery. A lover of primitive cinema, he has cunningly summoned the light-and-shadow techniques and experimentations of the Golden Age of film to resuscitate a unique cinematographic language which plays with the spectator\u2019s unconscious by means of visual trickery as disturbing as it is absurd. In an attitude as playful at that Maddin\u2019s films this documentary follows the mediumistic experiments of this master of illusion, filmed during the \u2018\u2019spirit\u2019\u2019 shootings he presented in Europe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i0VtZtbnLyYt09w8DJ8L3MUMLYH.jpg", "actors": ["Guy Maddin ()", "Stephen Quay ()", "Timothy Quay ()", "John Waters ()", "Kenneth Anger ()", "Udo Kier ()", "Isabella Rossellini ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "S9ECZmCJ84c"}
