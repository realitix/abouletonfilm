The artist and his family were some of the 250,000 people who inhabited the tiny island between 1978 and 1991; it was once one of the most densely populated places in the world. After the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees shuttered the camp in 1991, Pulau Bidong became overgrown by jungle, filled with crumbling monuments and relics.  The film takes place in a dystopian future in which the last man on earth - having escaped forced repatriation to Vietnam - finds a United Nations scientists who has washed ashore after teh world\u2019s last nuclear battle. By weaving together footage from Bidong\u2019s past with a narrative set in its future, Nguyen questions the individual\u2019s relationship to history, trauma, nationhood, and displacement.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ui3oe32cv9LybXFlN0ZqDBMhkDB.jpg", "actors": ["Ph\u1ea1m Anh Khoa ()", "Donika Do Tinh ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
