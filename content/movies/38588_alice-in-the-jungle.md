Julius falls and is nearly eaten by crocodiles but manages to escape nevertheless. Meanwhile, two elephant children are having fun at a watering hole and a monkey barber has his barber pole eaten by a hippo, who mistakes it for a candy cane. Julius tries to remedy the latter injustice by starching up a tiger's striped tail and knocking it off, using it as a replacement pole. Alice hunts a lion who proves to be too much for her to handle, but Julius bravely comes to the rescue.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pdvmqydltX72whfhjS2GIwrM5Tk.jpg", "actors": ["Virginia Davis (Alice)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [40788], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
