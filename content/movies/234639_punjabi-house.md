When they notice Unni drowning, Unni pretends to be deaf and mute so that he can fake his death and the insurance money reaches his family. Gangadharan however has a debt of his own, to a Punjabi family of money lenders who have settled in Kerala. He is forced to make Unni and Ramanan to work at their home until he can repay it. A series of interesting events follow after Unni meets Pooja (Mohini) at the house, who is deaf and mute.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v1bbWKzG9RDZbemuEmTDCQWhGTc.jpg", "actors": ["Dileep (Unni)", "Harisree Ashokan (Ramanan)", "Cochin Haneefa (Gangadharan)", "Mohini (Pooja)", "Lal (Sikkandar Singh)", "Janardhanan (Manninder Singh)", "Thilakan (Kaimal)", "Jomol (Sujatha)", "Neena Kurup (Karishma)", "Indrans (Uthaman)", "N F Varghese (Sujatha's Father)", "Manka Mahesh (Unni's Mother)", "Praseetha Menon (Cook)", "Machan Varghese (Lawrence)", "Kunchan (Thommichan)", "Reena ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [322018, 237728, 461292, 134474], "youtube_key": "a-1gmzYd8M4"}
