Coudray first met Bartas ten years ago, when he, then a young French producer, came to Vilnius to work on Bartas\u2019 film \u201cFreedom\u201d (Laisv\u0117, 2000). Fascinated by the director\u2019s cinematographic work, he wanted to discover what made him and his films so exceptional. The film combines interviews of Bartas, talking about his films, his creative intentions, reminiscing about the beginning of his career as a filmmaker, and Coudray\u2019s personal opinion on the director. Including archival footage from shooting sets, the film offers a rare opportunity to know more about the creative process and personality of the acclaimed filmmaker.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7MZQcCNVqWiDmIZXKcizgwWh5yL.jpg", "actors": ["\u0160ar\u016bnas Bartas (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
