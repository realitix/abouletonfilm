He falls in love with a tribal girl \"Tulasi\" (played by Archana). He gets arrested by Police as they mistakenly identify him as a Naxalite. In an unfortunate event, he kills a police man and gets life imprisonment. The whole plot runs in the form of story telling when Bhanu Chandar was released from the jail and while he travels in a school bus. He was hoping that Archana still waits for him even after several years of his jail term, thus the name of this film is \"Nireekshana\" which means The Waiting.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tx2lBOmlxZFTojNdpskIJoXoCNi.jpg", "actors": ["Archana ()", "Bhanuchander ()", "P.
