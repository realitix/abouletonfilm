His first task is to choose one of two communist slogans. He picks the shorter one, which is appreciated by his class, because they have to build the slogan on the hillside using whitewashed rocks. However, this means that the longer slogan goes to Diana, the French teacher to whom Andre is attracted. Andre gets on the wrong side of the communist party boss of the village, when he stands up for an unjustly accused goat herdsman, whom he had befriended. The boss is determined to take his revenge on Andre.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kwdQerEAIcxqJmmr4CfoXGIqS4.jpg", "actors": ["David Elmasllari (David)", "Artur Gorishti (Andre)", "Luiza Xhuvani (Diana)", "Robert Ndrenika (Llesh)", "Marko Bitraku (Gjin)", "Agim Qirjaqi (School Director)", "Niko Kanxheri (Selman Tosku)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
