{"tmdb_id": 189030, "title": "To Die in Jerusalem", "original_title": "To Die in Jerusalem", "slug_title": "to-die-in-jerusalem", "date": "2007-10-27", "genre": ["Documentaire"], "score": "7.0/10", "synopsis": "Ever since 17-year-old Rachel Levy, an Israeli, was killed four years ago in Jerusalem by a Palestinian suicide bomber, her mother Abigail has found hardly a moment's peace. Levy's killer was Ayat al-Akhras, also 17, a schoolgirl from a Palestinian refugee camp several miles away. The two young women looked unbelievably alike. TO DIE IN JERUSALEM unabashedly explores the Palestinian-Israeli conflict through the personal loss of two families. The film's most revealing moment is in an emotionally charged meeting between the mothers of the girls, presenting the most current reflection of the conflict as seen thru their eyes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oxTafYiTVi4UQUTsgIpbAtSRw29.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "GT5nasvAGNI"}
