She finds solace in her (imaginary?) relationship with a mystical cowboy (Billy Burke) while dealing with the challenges of her man-hungry single mother (Alicia Silverstone) and her troubled little brother, who has an affinity for a Native neighbor, Tenkill (Michael Spears).\r\n\r\nReleased in 2014, this was director William Robert Carey\u2019s first-and-only film based on his 2013 novel \u201cJesus in Cowboy Boots,\u201d which was the movie\u2019s original title. It\u2019s an offbeat, mundane and gritty drama with one fantasy component; it\u2019s definitely not a comedy as advertised elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSimilar quirky films that come to mind include \u201cMichael\u201d (1996), \u201cDreamland\u201d (2006), \u201cDon\u2019t Come Knocking\u201d (2005), \u201cMud\u201d (2012) and \u201cJoe\u201d (2013). It has the fantasy element of \u201cMichael,\u201d the trailer-in-the-desert setting of \u201cDreamland\u201d and the ugly redneck drama of the other three, as well as the indie artiness of \u201cDon\u2019t Come Knocking.\u201d It lacks the great amusement and positivity of \u201cMichael,\u201d but it\u2019s arguably on par with the others, just different.\r\n\r\nSilverstone was a hot item in the mid/late 90s and early 2000s, but she has since sorta faded away. The last movie I remember her in was from a decade earlier, \u201cScooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed\u201d (2004). Here she was 37 during shooting playing a 31 year-old woman (who looks older) desperate to settle down with a man before she\u2019s over-the-hill. She had a couple of kids during those ten years and so put on a little noticeable weight; yet she\u2019s still a stunning babe, just with more \u201cmileage,\u201d as it\u2019s put in the movie.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 39 minutes and was shot in Agua Dulce & Santa Clarita, California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"}], "recommandations_id": []}
