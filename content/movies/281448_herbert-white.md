The story follows Herbert as he works in the lumber industry, supports his family, and stalks and murders women he picks up in town. While Herbert is not exactly sympathetic, viewers are allowed to enter the mind of a serial killer, and realize that most of the time he behaves like everyone else. Movies like \u201cHenry: Portrait of a Serial Killer\u201d have done this before, but to successfully position the audience inside the mind of a complex human monster in 14 short minutes is quite a feat.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wwdQMGXUOBxCTECucCeIzLupwcD.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Shannon (Herbert White)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
