Orfeo (Stephanie Blythe) is so consumed with grief at the death of his beloved Euridice (Danielle de Niese) that the gods (Heidi Grant Murphy as Amor) allow him to lead her back from the underworld\u2014if he will not look at her on the way. Of course he can\u2019t resist looking, but the gods are truly merciful.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9QC2TI3oMAuVWCZQNsw3wIZJI7g.jpg", "actors": ["Stephanie Blythe (ORFEO)", "Danielle de Niese (EURIDICE)", "Heidi Grant Murphy (AMORE)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
