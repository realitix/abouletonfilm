The boy's mother (who suffers from cancer) tries to prove who is the guilty one. In the meanwhile, the movie goes on showing how teenagers become male prostitutes. It depicts Athens in a very decadent way. A reporter (Michalis Maniatis) starts working on an article about this case and gets beaten by a bunch of gay bikers!
