No matter how beautifully he recites Hungarian poetry, Wilson, a political refugee in his late fifties, fails the exams for the umpteenth time, because he doesn\u2019t know where the periodical \u2018Magyar K\u00f6zl\u00f6ny\u2019 got its name from, and what the Corvinae are. Moreover, inspired by V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty\u2019s poem, the committee chairman even questions his reasons for leaving his mother country. Wilson argues that his reasons include his fellow citizens cutting pregnant women in half, yet he doesn\u2019t manage to soften the heart of the committee members.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eR7GuRgJVQU9RgKFqoftJ7bfuBz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
