Karl (Joachim Latsch) and Richard (Hans-Use Bauer) become close friends while serving time in a German POW camp. One day Karl manages a successful escape and goes to Richard's home where he seeks refuge posing as Richard. But Richard's wife Anna (Kathrin Waligura) has never given up hope that her husband is still alive -- a possibility that would shatter Karl's proposed new life. In fact, Richard did not die in the POW camp. This film shared the Grand Prix award at the 1985 Berlin Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eMvQoeFlycBBQDCKyoYK3G4eRU5.jpg", "actors": ["Kathrin Waligura (Anna)", "Joachim L\u00e4tsch (Karl)", "Peter Zimmermann (Richard)", "Katrin Knappe (Marie)", "Ulrich M\u00fche (Revolution\u00e4r)", "Christine Schorn (Trude)", "Siegfried H\u00f6chst (Horst)", "Hans-Uwe Bauer (Verwirrter Soldat)", "Herbert Sand (Kriegsinvalide)", "Erdmute Schmidt-Christian ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
