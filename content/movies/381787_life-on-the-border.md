Kurdish filmmaker Bahman Ghobadi has given eight children the opportunity to use a camera to tell their own stories. Each  film gives us a glimpse into the plight of the children, as seen through their own eyes. Their stories tell of young people  with their whole lives ahead of them, though they\u2019ve already lost almost everything. At a certain point, the film crew leaves the camp and follows the 13-year-old Mahmod and his sister in the search for his parent\u2018s house in Koban\u00ea. The town has been ravaged by the war and all the children find is rubble. The eight films reveal the courage and openness of the young filmmakers, who share their stories with great intensity, realism and poetry, despite their harsh fate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mZV0MmedfqWO8qYfyNSsG1dRGa0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
