Through a classified ad he meets Sonia, a sweet, pleasant, intelligent girl. However, she weighs 125 pounds -- which according to Vittorio is way too much. A goldsmith by trade, Vittorio is obsessed with the desire to shape Sonia's body and mind as does a fire with gold. Almost imperceptibly Sonia becomes a passive participant and the relationship grows into a reciprocal masochistic game. When the two lovers isolate themselves in a country house in the Veneto hills, they dangerously lose touch with reality and the rest of the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eLzgCnAHkEbtbrKH19q8zO4p1fT.jpg", "actors": ["Vitaliano Trevisan (Vittorio)", "Michela Cescon (Sonia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [174684, 35265, 77562, 5206], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
