Things have changed significantly in Harry's world. With no dark wizards or witches left, the Ministry of Magic's Auror Department shuts down, leaving Harry unemployed. Ginny wants to start a family, Hermione is having doubts about her goody-goody lifestyle, and Ron... well, he's Ron. Everything seems very average in a late-twenties-problem kind of way-- but as always, trouble finds Harry yet again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zh1KtXxbcfj3wj202aEEE2E8V3n.jpg", "actors": ["Matt DeNoto ()", "Matt DeNoto (Harry Potter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
