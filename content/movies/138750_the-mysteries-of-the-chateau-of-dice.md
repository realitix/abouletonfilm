A castle is perched on a hilltop. Below it, a posh, modern villa. Meanwhile, far from Paris, two men with masked faces play dice in a bar. They decide to drive to Paris. Country roads, hills, fences. The posh \"chateau\" appears again: meticulous garden, fancy interior, odd sculptures. And at home? \"No one, NO ONE.\" For the next two days, masked figures play dice, frolic by the pool, perform exercises with a ball. Two new figures arrive. Masked. They search and find the dice. They dance. Mannequin hands hold a pair of dice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xVAl1N0ognZ4JVG7BkDRrmOOrAP.jpg", "actors": ["Man Ray ()", "Georges Auric ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [161898, 175503, 143278, 151823], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
