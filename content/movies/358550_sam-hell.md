Sean Taylor, foreman at the haunted house, buys what he thinks is a fake corpse head in a cage. But when his girlfriend, Jill, sees it, she says it smells and wants it gone. Little do either of them suspect that this pungent, rotting zombie is very real, very undead and is about to change their lives forever. When the corpse begins to telepathically communicate with him, Sean begins his descent into madness and the world of the paranormal. He goes on a murderous rampage, doing the cadaver's bidding with a machete and a twisted grin. As the body count begins to rise, Jill discovers, with the help of a paranormal detective, that the caged ghoul has a nasty history as a serial killer and used to work at the very same haunted house.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2UJNUGQdM1vPEfuFWPJSAaVsAie.jpg", "actors": ["Osa Wallander (Jill Mathews)", "Brian Graves (Sean)", "Keith Lewis (Mike Tillman)", "Kristin Pfeifer (Patty Gail)", "Skip Pipo (Sam Hellson)", "Ross Kidder (Bear)", "Jarrod Rogen (Brad Dillion)", "Rachel Blaha (Stacy)", "Melissa Cipollone (Cheryl)", "Tyler Bryan (Martin)", "Billy Bryan (Charlie Dood)", "Maria Olsen (Nurse Kelly)", "Bruna Matsin (Alice's Mother)", "Paul Fanning (Alice's Father)", "Daylon Lewis (Young Alice)", "Kenny Lombino (Cafe Manager)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
