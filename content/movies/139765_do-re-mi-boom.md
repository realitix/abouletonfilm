A passerby hears a maid's music, fancies he's found his true love, and chats her up. Her boyfriend arrives for his music lesson and jealously dismisses the interloper, who swipes a grinder's organ (and monkey) to help him serenade the maid. Later he follows the boyfriend to a residence hotel and plants a bomb in the man's piano. The organ-grinder is gunning for the thief, and soon the piano, bomb, monkey, thief, and pistol-packing grinder are rolling down the road to the delight of maid and lover. It's ka-boom for some and a kiss for others.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/znsFHabB4ut3aCC3hNxSHEAkbYQ.jpg", "actors": ["Chester Conklin (The Suitor)", "Charles Arling (The Music Teacher - the Suitor's Rival)", "Harry Booker (Tuneful Tony - the Organ Grinder)", "Fred Hibbard (The Cop)", "Charles Lakin (Park Boyfriend)", "William Sheer (Desk Clerk)", "Vivian Edwards (Girl in Hotel Lobby)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
