Together, they shake a tree and a bounty of fruit falls. They gorge on the bounty, growing huge. They are tempted by a lovely woman; she drops the key to a door, which, when opened, reveals a live-action black-and-yellow montage of modern life (airplanes, traffic jams, etc.). A dispute between the two leads to another montage, this time scenes of war.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
