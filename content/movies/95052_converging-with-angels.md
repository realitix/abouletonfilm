A sad little stray cat in a Lycra dress and Prada shoes, Allison Campbell is looking for security or love, and she may not know the difference. While Dylan plies his trade in swank hotels, a tentative domestic relationship with seemingly homeless Allison evolves, based on the illusion that neither of them has a past. Voyeurism is the dramatic strategy and the lure for this story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bPISQtJQq4z6kHcVZS0SeqPflX0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
