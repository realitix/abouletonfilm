Throughout it all she is constantly in peril from one thing or another, crocodiles, hippos, car accidents, drowning, you name it. Even at the very end the crazed big game hunter is in a scuba suit sneaking up under the boat and drilling a hole in its hull.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rdpy2zwAmAnZvO79biVNWY8Ysuq.jpg", "actors": ["Pat Boone (George Stedman)", "Pamela Austin (Pauline)", "Terry-Thomas (Sten Martin)", "Edward Everett Horton (Caspar Coleman)", "Hamilton Camp (Thorpe)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
