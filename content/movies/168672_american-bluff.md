Robert De Niro makes a cameo and reminds the audience why he was at one time the best screen actor in the world.\r\n\r\nThis is a black comedy-drama set in the late 1970's based on the true life Abscam scandal. FBI agents and con artists joined up to frame politicians for taking bribes.\r\n\r\nBale plays a pot bellied hustler with bad hair. Amy Adams is his partner in crime who passes off as an English Aristocrat. Both have struck it rich in a scam where they dupe arrangement fees for loans that never come to fruition.\r\n\r\nCooper is the ambitious FBI agent with a big ego who has the the mafia in his sights and wants to reel in a big catch but he might be out of his depth.\r\n\r\nJeremy Renner is the charismatic Mayor of New Jersey. A man with a big heart who wants to get things done and Bale feels guilty about getting him involved in the sting operation.\r\n\r\nDirector David O Russell gets great performances from his cast but the film feels flabby which blunts the story and the humour feels stretched at times."}], "recommandations_id": [152532, 45317, 109424, 68734]}
