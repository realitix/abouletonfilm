A few months after they'd finished they then sat down to reflect upon the journey, talk about the railways and produce this .. the feature length Documentary.  Contains new footage, that was not previously published in the daily videos.  A huge thanks (as always) to our Kickstarter backers for making this happen!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vaWNHWU2ZUJlHUAGzQaO0uHnJOY.jpg", "actors": ["Geoff Marshall (Himself)", "Vicki Pipe (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
