{"tmdb_id": 296069, "title": "Nuclear Family", "original_title": "Nuclear Family", "slug_title": "nuclear-family", "date": "2001-09-17", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "The film explores institutional and personal representations of memory and behavior through a complex interweaving of scientific documentation, animal behavior experiments and vintage pre-school footage. The approach is formalistic and optically printed material is used throughout. The drama of the nuclear family is played by a series of non-human subjects - ranging from mannequins used in 1950s nuclear blast experiments, to doves playing ping-pong. The notion of family is experienced as iconic, nostalgic and a recollected remnant of the nuclear age.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8u2W6JiqZ5pIVhwr3JlF9WS4mbJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
