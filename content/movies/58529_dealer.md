His clients include the leader of a religious sect, a friend who needs a final fix, a former lover who has had his child, a student, and a black marketeer. Fliegauf's film recreates life in a city that resembles a ghost town, an alienated world with its own priorities and realities. It is, he says '. an imaginary city with a strongly spiritualist atmosphere. This necropolis is the film's real protagonist'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9GCPef3vIBp9mwfIfT8cdJzyGcl.jpg", "actors": ["Fel\u00edci\u00e1n Keresztes (Dealer)", "Barbara Thurz\u00f3 (Barbara)", "Edina Balogh ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
