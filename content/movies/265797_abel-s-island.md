After flying some distance, Abel discovers himself alone on a river island, unable to swim due to the powerful current. Abel periodically attempts to leave the island by various means: flying on a leaf, rowing a crudely fashioned boat, etc. Meanwhile, he tries to create a normal life of sorts, even learning to enjoy a new hobby: sculpture. Still, Abel's goal is to escape the island and rejoin his wife in the city.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bQRtQz0A9fVk3lSvcq86wnlTDES.jpg", "actors": ["Tim Curry (Abel (voice))", "Lionel Jeffries (Gower (voice))", "Heidi Stallings (Amanda (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
