They formed Strapped, an organization determined to find a way to safely ride these monster waves, and developed tow-in surfing--a technique which allows these fearless wave riders to stand up to some of the biggest waves in the world. This documentary explains their technique, and shows them in action--set to the sounds of U2, Mint Royale, Endo, Soil, and Grand Theft Auto.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t2UmcrYogrVLi7SWjoZDcWxk8vx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
