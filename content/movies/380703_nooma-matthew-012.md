One moment we have them and the next they're gone. What are we supposed to do? How are we supposed to feel? The truth is, there's no certain way we're \"supposed\" to feel. Whatever we're feeling, it's okay. It's okay to feel shock, anger, denial, or whatever we may feel. It's okay. And if we don't feel anything at all, that's okay too. It's okay to have no answers and no explanations. Because sometimes all the reasoning and comforting words in the world just aren't what we need. What might help us, however, is to understand how Jesus dealt with this kind of loss.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Rob Bell (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
