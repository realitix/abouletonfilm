She had lived there from the age of seven and often returned. At the time of filming, the house was about to be taken back by the council - this film is an effective 'goodbye'. Margaret Tait said it 'was meant to define a place, or the feeling of being in one place, with the sense this gives one, not of restriction but of the infinite variations available.'", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cRP30nLnEnNI4b6fpJPD14xrBzM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
