She releases their prisoners, leading her vengeful half-sister Abigaille to plot to take power. Nabucco declares himself a god and is struck by a bolt of lightning.  Abigaille tricks the now feeble king into signing a death warrant for the Israelites, including Fenena and Ismaele. Nabucco prays to the God of Israel for forgiveness; his sanity is restored and he saves the prisoners from death. He converts himself and his people, while Abigaille commits suicide.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3O3hWQvWKNqgd2fA5VITjeiQ266.jpg", "actors": ["Maurizio Benini (Conductor)", "Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (Nabucco)", "John Relyea (Zaccaria)", "Liudmyla Monastyrska (Abigaille)", "Leonardo Capalbo (Ismaele)", "Jamie Barton (Fenena)", "Vlada Borovko (Anna)", "Samuel Sakker (Abdallo)", "David Shipley (High Priest of Baal)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
