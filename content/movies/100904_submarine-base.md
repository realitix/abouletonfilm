Morgan makes his headquarters at the Halfway House run by the parents of Maria Styx as a bar and dance resort catering to the planters and traders of the island. Taggert finds himself practically a prisoner along with a group of American girls acting as entertainers at the resort. Taggert shadows Morgan in his activities in a remote cove and finds that Morgan is supplying German U-boat commanders with torpedoes, but does not know that Morgan has rigged the torpedoes with clock devices that explode when at sea and sinks the U-boats.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bAQMvO9ZeVC83sIUOB5Wl0cHlKn.jpg", "actors": ["John Litel (James Xavier 'Jim' Taggart)", "Alan Baxter (Joe Morgan)", "Eric Blore (Spike, Morgan's Aide)", "Georges Metaxa (Nazi Agent Anton Kroll)", "George Flaherty (David Cavanaugh)", "Rafael Storm (Felipo)", "Fifi D'Orsay (Maria Styx)", "Iris Adrian (Dorothy)", "Jacqueline Dalya (Judy Pierson)", "Anna Demetrio (Angela Styx)", "Luis Alberni (Mr. Styx)", "Lucien Prival (Capt.
