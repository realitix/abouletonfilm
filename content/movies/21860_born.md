Possessed by the demon fetus growing within her womb, Mary Elizabeth obeys her homicidal cravings to kill, for the sake of her unborn spawn. Mary Elizabeth's dark transformation is controlled by her unborn demon child's deadly evil cravings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cukGR3vUDNkyDhSQG6ydYJx9144.jpg", "actors": ["Joan Severance (Dr. Sammael)", "Alison Brie (Mary Elizabeth)", "Kane Hodder (Asmodeus / Cardinal)", "Denise Crosby (Catherine)", "James T.

Things like: the lead having siblings that are twice her age, the standard-rate awful CGI you find in movies with this low a budget, and the absolute worst body-double nudity I've seen to date.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing.
