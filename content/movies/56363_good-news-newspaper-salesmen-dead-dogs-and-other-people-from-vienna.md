We see their lives on the street, their cramped living quarters, their minders, the 'training' days, and the inhumane process which keeps them working endless hour for little reward.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f1y0WEanhFEYm7wMolzs7PjZFaP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
