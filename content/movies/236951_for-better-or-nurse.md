She throws them out, so they scheme to hurt themselves enough to get hospitalized, with no luck. Bluto gets a wall to fall on him, but stands in the window. Popeye tries to get run over by a steam-roller, but a street cleaner saves him. Bluto dives off a skyscraper - into a huge pile of mattresses. Popeye stands in a naval gunnery range, but the gunners miss the target. Bluto taunts a bull, but stands next to a billboard of an attractive cow, which distracts the bull. Popeye crashes a plane, but the ambulance crew rescues the plane. The boys compete to get run over by a train, but punch each other off the tracks just as the train arrives. Finally, Popeye forces a can of spinach down Bluto's throat and gets a pounding. That lands him in the hospital but not Olive's; they failed to notice the sign: \"Cat and Dog Hospital.\" They start fighting like cats and dogs, and get hauled off to the looney bin.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nT9eO2jaKfGeWyyZpM01kDHA7A0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
