Gigi starts off the season with a huge wishlist of things pink and pretty, but soon realizes she hasn\u2019t been thinking about giving gifts to other people she loves. Suddenly the whole season turns into a race to give and receive things\u2014and that just doesn\u2019t seem right. Thankfully Gigi\u2019s mom and dad were kids once too, and can help their little girl remember how to keep her heart aimed at the real star of Christmas\u2014while still enjoying all the celebrations. \u201cI am bringing you good news. It will be a joy to all the people. Today your Savior was born in David\u2019s town. He is Christ, the Lord.\u201d Luke 2:10-11 (ICB)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r1ovIgL0ZSK8cIMzoSyg2Zrf8k5.jpg", "actors": ["Kasey Eldridge (Gigi)", "Stephanie Siemiller (Voice)", "Tim Vogel (Guest and Wiseman (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
