The revelation hurls the prince into a torrent of meditation, and he emerges with a plan to prove his uncle's guilt. If the story sounds familiar, that's because it's a Peking Opera adaptation of Shakespeare's \"Hamlet.\"", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
