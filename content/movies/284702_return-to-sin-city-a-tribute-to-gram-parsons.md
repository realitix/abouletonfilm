Gram's daughter Polly organized this amazing gathering of his close friends and biggest fans for a Sin City tribute honoring this prince of longhair country boys. A sampling of the live performances include Six Days on the Road Sin City All Stars; Big Mouth Blues Jim Lauderdale; Devil in Disguise Jay Farrar; Sleepless Nights Lucinda Williams; Love Hurts Keith Richards &amp; Norah Jones; Sin City Dwight Yoakam, and more, including commentaries by Polly Parsons and Shilah Morrow.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mDW3qI1CR27570MguSK1IEQ65AF.jpg", "actors": ["Keith Richards (Himself (vocals, acoustic guitar))", "Norah Jones (Herself (vocals, piano))", "Dwight Yoakam (Himself (vocals, acoustic guitar))", "Steve Earle (Himself (vocals, acoustic guitar))", "John Doe (Himself (vocals, acoustic guitar))", "Lucinda Williams (Herself (vocals, acoustic guitar))", "Jay Farrar (Himself (vocals, acoustic guitar))", "Jim Lauderdale (Himself (vocals, acoustic guitar))", "Raul Malo (Himself (vocals))", "Kathleen Edwards (Herself (vocals))", "Susan Marshall (Herself (vocals))", "Charlie Terrell (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "B2sNYUQlV7c"}
