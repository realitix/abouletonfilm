Canton, is southern China\u2019s centuries-old trading port. Today the booming metropolis of 14 million is a mecca of mass consumption, its vast international trading centers crammed with every \u201cMade in China\u201d good imaginable. Every year more than half a million Africans travel to Guangzhou where they buy goods to sell back in Africa. Over time, some have chosen to stay, and for these Africans China looks like the new land of opportunity, a place where anything is possible. But is it?  Featuring a dynamic cast of men and women from Cameroon, Kenya, Nigeria and Uganda, GUANGZHOU DREAM FACTORY weaves the stories of Africans chasing alluring, yet elusive, \u201cMade in China\u201d dreams into a compelling critique of 21st century global capitalism. Following a filmmaker\u2019s journey from Ghana to China and back to Africa, GUANGZHOU DREAM FACTORY provides a rare glimpse of African aspirations in an age of endless outsourcing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9oSxtfQacXSZiApjMyWWUu8J7ji.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "4FMseThzb3Y"}
