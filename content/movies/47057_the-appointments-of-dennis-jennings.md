He is a professional waiter and has an equally-dull girlfriend, Emma. In an attempt to release his pent-up feelings of isolation, he begins seeing a psychiatrist (Rowan Atkinson), only to discover that the doctor is somewhat less than interested in what he has to say. After finding his doctor sharing his intimate secrets with a group of fellow psychiatrists at a bar, and then finding that his girlfriend is cheating on him with the doctor, Dennis decides he has had enough. He hunts the doctor down in the woods and shoots him, ending up in jail with an equally uncaring prison shrink.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bbDBMttCbAHqC7iPIiOTah1yiYG.jpg", "actors": ["Steven Wright (Dennis Jennings)", "Rowan Atkinson (Dr. Schooner)", "Laurie Metcalf (Emma)", "Carrotte (Laughing Psychiatrist)", "Christopher Durang (Laughing Psychiatrist)", "Martha Gehman (Lisa)", "Joe Grifasi (Bartender)", "Thomas Ikeda (Laughing Psychiatrist)", "Dana Ivey (Newscaster)", "Peter Maloney (Dr. Wilson)", "Bill McCutcheon (Man on TV)", "Mick Muldoon (Repairman)", "David Hyde Pierce (Businessman)", "Mike Starr (Doorman)", "John Tillinger (Psychiatrist Drawing)", "Damian Young (Businessman)", "Rochelle Oliver (Woman on TV)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
