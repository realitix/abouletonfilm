Gwar celebrates the end of the world as the comet Ragnarok threatens to destroy the Earth. When Grey Aliens crash the party and artificially inseminate Slymenstra with Orderus' sperm, the resulting hybrid mutant space child attracts the attention of Gwar's ancient enemy, the giant robot Cardinal Syn and his Holy Warriors from Outer Space.  The bulk of the video is concert footage, with a mock interview interspersed between each song. Additionally, three music videos - \"Saddam a Go-Go,\" \"Meat Sandwich,\" and \"Surf of Syn\" - are included.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pT4XzQR55f8rgthgeG1BFYm88qa.jpg", "actors": ["GWAR ()", "Dave Brockie (Oderus Urungus)", "Bob Gorman (Mason Temple)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
