As I learned from the werkfilm on the DVD, the story was specifically written for Ol\u00e1h, who in real life was the runner-up of the very first such TV show in Hungary \u201cMegaszt\u00e1r\u201d (\u201cMegaStar\u201d) in 2004. She didn\u2019t win there despite being many viewers\u2019 favorite and having a terrific voice. It is kind of a consolation that she won in the movie, although reading the legal troubles about getting her fee must have made the victory sour.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jqt1pw91gmtn0fmG91Opketkgbc.jpg", "actors": ["Ibolya Ol\u00e1h (Kati Ormos)", "Andr\u00e1s Kern (Rezs\u0151)", "Edit Bal\u00e1zsovits (Panni)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
