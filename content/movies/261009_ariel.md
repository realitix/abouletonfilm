He became a living embodiment of the\r ongoing duel between man and machine. From that point on, he\r began to rediscover the meaning of freedom: to rebuild his broken\r identity, keep his family together and design his own prosthetic legs.\r Following Ariel for 10 years from the time of the accident, director\r Laura Bari has created an intimate and metaphorical portrait of Ariel\u2019s\r newfound transhumanity, juxtaposing his daily life with dreamlike inner\r worlds\u2014and pushing the boundary between the real and the imaginary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pdyaj1oivgNqAn1ojzjtOtxRJTm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
