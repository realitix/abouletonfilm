With director Tetsuya Nakashima working in a similar, equally satisfying style as in his 1995 debut, \u201cHappy Go Lucky,\u201d pic manages the neat trick of being both very funny and very sad. Fests are a good bet, although film\u2019s commercial fate is shadowy due to a deliberate style and episodic narrative that require extra viewer effort.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wsi7s84yBPZdtowEEUFY7lDmzGh.jpg", "actors": ["Momoko Bit\u00f4 ()", "Teruyuki Kagawa ()", "Ittoku Kishibe ()", "Masatoshi Nagase ()", "Kumi Nakamura ()", "Yutaka Suzuki ()", "Tsutomu Yamazaki ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
