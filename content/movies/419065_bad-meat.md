Earl is a simple man with a simple desire--to marry Pam, the only available girl in town. But she'll only give herself to a man who meets her strict criteria, including trailer-home ownership. And Earl's conniving boss at the meat-packing plant will do anything to win Pam's heart first. Buddy, on the other hand, wrongly fancies himself a master criminal, scheming big and failing big while avoiding both legitimate employment and his heartless parole officer. When Buddy hatches a brainless scheme to kidnap a corrupt U.S. Congressman for ransom.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jouIPCmksaXxT3p1EFLaHDxiUi.jpg", "actors": ["Chevy Chase (Congressman Bernard P.
