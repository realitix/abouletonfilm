Their work makes their community, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, resonate with the ancient Ojibway prophecy of the seven fires, a premonition of the arrival of white people. Using video effects, animation and off-kilter editing, and combining testimonials, experimental sequences and performances, the filmmakers brilliantly demolish linear filmic narrative \u2013 not to mention the Western concept of history. Overflowing with inventiveness, INAATE/SE/ revives traditional spirituality and culture, confronts an obfuscated colonial reality, and works toward building a modern identity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pJ0hrB9e2nIaERWMvYxw5LPEiKZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
