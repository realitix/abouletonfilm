Named after a 19th-century Native leader, the centre offers a space where Natives can come together for mutual support, partake in healing rituals like the sweat lodge, and rediscover their traditions. The film shows the despair of a people dispossessed of land, culture, language and dignity, and their strength and courage in overcoming substance abuse.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hPJoKeGFVfVGIh9PjI7zWPZNmLr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
