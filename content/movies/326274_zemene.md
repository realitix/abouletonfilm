With her physical limitations lifted, and the confirmation that her life matters, she blossoms into a confident young woman, using her newly found capabilities to bring hope back to her village. Gorgeously filmed in the Ethiopian countryside, Zemene is a poignant testament to the strength of the human spirit \u2013 and a powerful depiction of how much impact one person can have on another\u2019s life. - Pia Chamberlain", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
