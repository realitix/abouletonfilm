Scout's owner, Billy, a rancher struggling to stay in business, pegs her as a useless, broken tool and has every intention of replacing her. But when the rancher's city slicker granddaughter, Madison, spends the summer on his ranch, the two outcasts form a special bond that ushers Scout into the new arena of Dog Agility Competition.  With the help of a cute teenage farm boy, Madison uncovers Scout's uncanny skill at agility competition and the trio spend their summer training for the Annual Youth Trainer Challenge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fNhY6LjbM2SpMPMmaXaA0VrODmO.jpg", "actors": ["Lance Henriksen (Bill)", "Cody Linley (Eli)", "Kate Krause (Annie)", "Miranda Money (Zoey)", "Dora Madison (Madison)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
