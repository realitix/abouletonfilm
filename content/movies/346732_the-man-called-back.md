The film is set in the tropics; Conrad Nagel tops the cast as a dissipated, derelict doctor, hopelessly in love with married socialite Doris Kenyon. Doris' insane husband John Halliday commits suicide, but arranges the evidence so that his wife will be charged with murder.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eYAyHuGeLzgquHNciVUOr05vCfb.jpg", "actors": ["Conrad Nagel (Dr. David Yorke)", "Doris Kenyon (Diana St. Claire)", "John Halliday (Gordon St. Claire)", "Juliette Compton (Vivien Lawrence)", "Reginald Owen (Dr. Herbert  Atkins)", "Mona Maris (Lilaya)", "Alan Mowbray (King's Counsel)", "Gilbert Emery (Sir Henry, Defense Counsel)", "Mae Busch (Rosie)", "John T.
