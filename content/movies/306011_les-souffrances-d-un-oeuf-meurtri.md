The credit sequence in which title cards show successively larger foetuses pulsating on the screen until the baby is born and cries.\r 2.) Etoile-directly referring to Cocteau, Lethem shows an adolescent sucking a starfish and then giving birth to a smaller starfish. A statement of inadequacy. To give birth involves an emasculation and a loss of vitality.\r 3.) Corps-two images of a man on a couch groping for each other, watched by a mysterious peeping Tom. As the two superimposed images come together, the heavy breathing subsides\u2026the statement that the birth of desire is a self \u2013 realisation.\r 4.) Hymen \u2013 The decaying body of a girl is shot through green filters, and the final image reveals her vagina crawling with maggots and overlain with a crucifix. A representation of Catholicism preventing the free expression of desire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2xk4EAStk0OvMvvOuC2r9OM6vJj.jpg", "actors": ["Andr\u00e9e McLey ()", "Roland Lespineux ()", "Jio Berk ()", "Nicole Duport ()", "Roland Lethem ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [251483, 160417, 157109, 166710], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
