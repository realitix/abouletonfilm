She follows the cycle of optimism, building and eventual decline, meeting people who 50 years on bear witness to the effects of housing on real families, striking a contemporary chord with the theme of immigration and gentrification affecting working class communities. The irresistible nostalgia of scenes from the 1950s, 60s and 70s is tempered by a realisation of the force of history at work.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2iz4dWewlFt3CLLUmMcU45Y2aR0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
