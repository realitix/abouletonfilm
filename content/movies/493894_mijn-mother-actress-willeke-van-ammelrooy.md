On movie sets and on screen, Denise saw her mother cry, laugh and fight. At home, however, Willeke shut herself off when she was sad. \u201cI\u2019ll only come back out once I\u2019m smiling again. Such is my way,\u201d she used to say.  The only time Denise really saw her cry was at the funeral of her father Leendert Janzee. He committed suicide when Denise was six years old. His decision to do so wasn\u2019t unexpected, but his death nevertheless meant the ultimate loss for Willeke. She had wanted to let him live through her love. She feels defeated and locks herself in until she is ready to face the world again. Meanwhile she expresses herself through her characters. In this compelling film mother and daughter look back on this deciding and emotional period in their lives, illustrated by home movies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nGx8SMHcy8xMgz1MnepsczwpBti.jpg", "actors": ["Willeke van Ammelrooy (herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
