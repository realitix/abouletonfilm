It records the sounds and movements of a \u201csonic digger,\u201d whose bucket has been replaced by a large cast-iron bell that destroys the interior of the building. The modified machine is thus transformed into a \u201ccounter-memorial\u201d instrument that marks the occasion of the closure of this significant workplace, a site associated with progress and health. Through music, it excavates the historical connection between medicine, sickness and cure, and the neocolonial framework of US-Puerto Rico relations embedded in the very fabric of the building.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
