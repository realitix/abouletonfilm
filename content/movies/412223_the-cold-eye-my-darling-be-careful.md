The film is about a certain stage in the development of a young artist confronting the real world in terms of her own idealistic notions of what art is supposed to do. You never see her. She is the camera\u2019s eye and when someone says to the camera \u201cMy darling be careful\u201d, it could be addressing her or you the spectator. The subjective camera set-up challenges your position as an impartial observer. - BM", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["James Barth ()", "Powers Boothe ()", "George Deem ()", "Kim Ginsberg ()", "Maggie Grynastyl ()", "Saskia Noordhoek-Hegt ()", "Valda Setterfield ()", "Ela Troyano ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
