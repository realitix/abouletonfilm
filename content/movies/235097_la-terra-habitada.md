Behind, an accumulation of sounds and images, where things are losing their name. A train takes us far away. To Mongolia. On the way, unknown faces, new melodies, gestures that fuse with the landscape. Being in a strange land, moving with it. With each step, our destination vanishes and pushes us forward, revealling the sense, that has always been there, that emerges through the mere existence: A land that, by undressing itself, fills up and inhabitates us. And from here, maybe, recover that place from which to look again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rIGUkcsAGElFX1jEUuNrfHCCO1o.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
