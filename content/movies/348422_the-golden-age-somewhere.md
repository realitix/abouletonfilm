We live online and download places to relax, parks and shopping malls. We can even interact with our friends as if they were in the same room with simulated tele-presence. Everyone is connected and immersed in nanorobotic replications of any kind of object or furnishings, downloadable on credit based systems. Distance and time become as alien as the 'offline' The local becomes the global and the global becomes the local. Consumer based capitalism has changed forever. A truly 'glocolised' world. The singularity is near.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/moaQzXPWZhncm6PWVHSG4V5aXig.jpg", "actors": ["Indre Balestuta ()", "Robert Leaf (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "duBYdhNo89U"}
