From SWAT raids to simple calls and even visits to wrong addresses, we are seeing more and more incidents of officers using lethal force against a family pet they deem a threat. Are these callous acts by officers in a system without regard for our four-legged family members, or are they true peace officers doing their best in a dangerous job? OF DOGS AND MEN investigates the issue from all angles, interviewing law enforcement officers and experts, and taking a journey with pet owners through the tragedy of loss and pursuit of change in a legal system in which the very officers they challenge are an integral part.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AvHHk9x7tzoLimDtuwU4CYnRWQf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
