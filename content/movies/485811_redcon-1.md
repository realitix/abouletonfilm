The spread of the virus is temporarily contained but, without a cure, it\u2019s only a matter of time before it breaks its boundaries and the biggest problem of all\u2026 any zombies with combat skills are now enhanced. With the South East of England quarantined from the rest of the world using fortified borders, intelligence finds that the scientist responsible for the outbreak is alive and well in London. With his recovery being the only hope of a cure, a squad of eight Special Forces soldiers is sent on a suicide mission to the city, now ruled by the undead, with a single task: get him out alive within 72 hours by any means necessary. What emerges is an unlikely pairing on a course to save humanity against ever-rising odds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jOYUbe61DQiY628inVkR1KERS30.jpg", "actors": ["Oris Erhuero (Captain Marcus Stanton)", "Carlos Gallardo (Sergeant Frederick Reeves)", "Mark Strange (Lieutenant Frank Perez)", "Joshua Dickinson (Private Perry Bernstein)", "Martyn Ford (Corporal Jacob Gallagher)", "Akira Koieyama (Sergeant Simon Lau)", "Katarina Leigh Waters (Sergeant Kira Paige)", "Michael Sheehan (Corporal Rodrigo Gonzalez)", "Euan MacNaughton (Major General Charles Smith)", "Robert Goodale (Doctor Julian Raynes)", "Douglas Russell (Ivan Gavric)", "Marc Baylis (James Rowan)", "Orla O'Rourke (Miranda)", "Jasmine Mitchell (Alicia Rowan)", "Lyndsay Fielding (Jennifer Stanton)", "Madeleine Kelly (Rachel)", "James Hadida (Ben Smith)", "Anthony Rhodes (Military Base Soldier)", "Nicolette McKeown (Young Woman Stranded)", "Chris Bain (Young Man Stranded)", "Michael Aston (General Debray Chief of the Defence Staff)", "Charles Delaney (General Thompson)", "Daniel Godward (General Peters)", "David Fox (Infected Santa)", "Christopher Pearson (Infected Priest)", "Brooke Fraser (Young Infected Girl Shot)", "Kaela Sherret (Infected Girl with Skipping Rope)", "Louise Wheeldon (Infected Dancing Girl)", "Pete Williamson (Infected Cocaine Man)", "Gavin McDowall (Infected Watching TV)", "Kevin Ashelby (Elite Soldier)", "Peter Anderson (Infected)", "Jobie McPartland (Infected Soldier at POW Camp)", "Olivia Story (Young Girl Amputated)", "Gemma Kershaw (Survivor Dragged From POW Bunker)", "Fiona Tulloch (Infected)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [330537, 454312, 279997, 86777], "youtube_key": "OqYyEJpa7xg"}
