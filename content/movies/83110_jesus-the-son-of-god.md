Young Jesus, age twelve, walks behind His parents carrying a lamb. Jesus is to present the lamb to the priest as a sacrifice for sins. Once inside the busy, noisy city full of trading and bartering, Jesus and His family sell and buy the things they need before taking the lamb to the priest. Jesus presents the lamb to the priest, and the priest tests Him by asking some questions about the law. Jesus' answers are correct and the priest congratulates Him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qA7VGrkj3HeDYI4lOxMvI6nn569.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
