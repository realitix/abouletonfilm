As they pile into James' car, BOBBY, a goth kid, accused of murdering his parents a year earlier, watches them from across the parking lot. As they drive off, he follows them. They arrive at the empty house and go in as Bobby pulls up and watches them. That night, they play a game of truth or dare. Tempers flare as truths are told and secrets and lies are revealed.
