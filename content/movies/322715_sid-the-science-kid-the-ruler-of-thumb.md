If Sid doesn't fill his chore chart with stickers, he'll never get that new Turbo-Mega-Rocket Ship toy. What's so important about a chart anyway? Sid soon learns that charts are great science tools for comparing and contrasting things like snacks, pets and even chores! When playing with a rolie polie bug, Sid discovers another amazing science tool - the magnifying glass! Now, Sid can see a whole new world through his magnifying glass and finds that bigger is better! Sid learns all about science tools like rulers and magnifying glasses and how they help us.
