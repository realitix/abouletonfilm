Return To Forever hit their commercial and artistic peak with a string of albums in the mid-seventies featuring the line-up of Chick Corea on keyboards, Stanley Clarke on bass, Al Di Meola on guitar and Lenny White on drums. In 2008 this classic line-up reunited for their first tour in 25 years and proved that their musicianship and the chemistry within the band were as strong as ever.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3sQ3r6ML20AuqWanRa99cRvPa6X.jpg", "actors": ["Chick Corea (Himself)", "Al Di Meola (Himself)", "Lenny White (Himself)", "Stanley Clarke (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "2r123KZbXUs"}
