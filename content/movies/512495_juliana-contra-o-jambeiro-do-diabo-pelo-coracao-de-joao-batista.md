He cannot sleep or eat, and even show his feelings for the photographer Juliana, the only person who could be interested in someone that strange and mysterious. But now, he realizes that his soul was taken away in a kid's play in childhood and soon he will die. So the couple go on a journey to the heart of Brazil, during carnival celebration of the countryside cities. Whether Jo\u00e3o's beliefs are real or not, to Juliana this may be the only chance of reconciliation. But on the other hand, for him the journey will be the last chance to face the devil that lurks, waiting and hiding among the carnival masks.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6fEbrX7e0cbJqx1GIiZzeyT0G2x.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
