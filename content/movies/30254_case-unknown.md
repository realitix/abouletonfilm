Dr. Konstanty Grot (Borys Szyc) is an ambitious young doctor who is determined to make a name for himself, to the point that his wife often accuses him of being more interested in his career than in her. Grot believes that he can earn the respect of his peers by successfully treating a supposedly incurable patient, and he believes he may have found a likely candidate in Pawel Plocki (Grzegorz Wolf), a mental patient who can barely function. Grot signs Plocki out of the mental hospital where he's been treated for years and moves him into his own home; in time, Plocki shows genuine improvement, and Grot thinks he?s beaten the state medical establishment at their own game. But that?s before Grot learns some secrets about his patient that cast his condition in a new and disturbing light.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rRRJ31DQuYqQ0gevKUqpMhpzRvg.jpg", "actors": ["Borys Szyc (Dr. Konstanty Grot)", "Grzegorz Wolf (Pawel Plocki)", "Magdalena Walach (Renata)", "Grzegorz Kwiecie\u0144 (Robert)", "Krzysztof Stroi\u0144ski (Ambroziak)", "Marian Opania (Debski)", "Ewa Zi\u0119tek (Renata's mother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
