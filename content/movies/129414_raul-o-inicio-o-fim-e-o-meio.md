A runaway flying saucer that abducted the hearts and minds of thousands of fans, Raul Seixas, a man who became a myth. Raul died young because he lived intensely. Rock n 'roll, free love, alternative society, drugs, black magic, military dictatorship, women and daughters. A man who wanted to live from his work and died for it. The beginning, the end and the middle are confused, because the story is not over. The film reveals through rare images of archive, meeting with relatives, conversations with artists, producers and friends, the trajectory of the legend of Rock.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pdA4WLLBdepENqRqSqlD0BrtUj2.jpg", "actors": ["Raul Seixas ()", "Paulo Coelho ()", "Marcelo Nova ()", "Caetano Veloso ()", "Tom Z\u00e9 ()", "Daniel de Oliveira ()", "T\u00e1rik de Souza ()", "Br\u00e1ulio Tavares ()", "Luiz Carlos Maciel ()", "Roberto Menescal ()", "Andr\u00e9 Midani ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [34196, 360139, 97989, 49723], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
