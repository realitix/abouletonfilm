He looks at a photo of his girlfriend, and she razzes him. He lies down on the tracks, but the train bypasses the section of tracks that he's lying on! He jumps off a cliff, but a tree saves him. The ball bounces... we see him on the sidewalk, crying, and singing to passersby.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
