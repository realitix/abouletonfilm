His reverie ends when he suddenly subdues the guard who has come to bring him his meal and in a flash, he is out and free. Various adventures await him within the town and with its people but in the end, he heads off into the jungle. He spends some time building a house and seems content to prefer the company of his radio and the animals around him to the townspeople. Then one day his sharp ears pick up a sound that could threaten his new-found life.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
