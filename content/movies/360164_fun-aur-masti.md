The acting and dialogues are simply superb and the direction is just fine to enjoy every bit of humor. This film comes with a simple story of an unemployed boy meets a local gangster and tries to fool him off. But then instead of seriousness their comic characters come out and make you laugh."}], "recommandations_id": []}
