In a notebook he finds in his flat, he crosses out a list of things he should do or pay attention to if he wants to become part of the French elite. In a painful dialogue with Martin, his alleged son, Hector notices himself in Martin; a young man full of dreams and ideals that turn out not to be matched by reality.  Metropole is a film about migration, about assimilation, about the haunting of one\u2019s past. It is a film about identity; lost, assumed, false. Metropole tells the story of millions of people out there who leave their homes behind in order to find a new one.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/90k4FLc8HDAV2kGj3khbDQHCfLD.jpg", "actors": ["Alex Descas ()", "Yoli Fuller ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
