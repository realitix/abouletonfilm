Standard rules apply, there's a myriad of characters who are in need of redemption or reconciliations, and of course it's a time for heroes and villains to thrust themselves forward. Action and suspense is never far away, and neither is blood! There's even some humour to be found, especially with a bickering couple of teenage lovers.\r\n\r\nSome of the CGI is poor and as is the norm with this type of film, there's daft scenes that ask you to just roll with it. If you can do that then there's a good time to be had here. 6/10"}], "recommandations_id": [65055, 60950, 79550, 71668], "youtube_key": "rYPgrotVpzc"}
