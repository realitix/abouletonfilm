As Hollywood productions become more and more sanitized, movie parlors with coin-operated \"peep\" machines catered increasingly to customers looking for something they couldn't see at their local theater.  By the 1950s, the \"peep show\" traded exclusively in erotica.  For the cost of their spare change, patrons could view short loops, or stag films, that featured voluptuous women in a variety of situations in which they inevitably ended up nude.  Made on the cheap, the stars of these films remain mostly anonymous, even if their measurements do not.  But there's no need for shame as we celebrate some of the most beautiful (and unknown) ladies of a bygone era with this marathon of feminine gorgeousness!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
