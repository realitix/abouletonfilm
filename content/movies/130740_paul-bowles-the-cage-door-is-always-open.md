When he moved to Tangier, Morocco, in 1949, half the world followed him to the enigmatic city. His marriage with author Jane Bowles was a loving relationship of opposites, even though both were homosexual. Based on exclusive interviews with Bowles shortly before his death interwoven with anecdotes recounted by his friends and co-workers, the film portrays a daring and visionary life as well as a relationship shaped by an interdependency that encompassed much more than sexuality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c4Jab4YK42pcWa3fsUcuGlRlUQx.jpg", "actors": ["John Waters ()", "Bernardo Bertolucci ()", "Gore Vidal ()", "Richard Horowitz ()", "John Giorno ()", "Edmund White ()", "Ira Cohen ()", "Cherie Nutting ()", "Mohammed Mrabet ()", "Karim Debbagh ()", "Tamara Dragadze ()", "Roland Beaufre ()", "Oliver Harris ()", "Florian Vetsch ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "4kj9g554-Ng"}
