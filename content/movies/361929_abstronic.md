Set to classical music by the likes of Bach, Saint-Sa\u00ebns, and Shoshtakovich, and replete with rapidly mutating geometries, Bute\u2019s filmmaking is at once formally rigorous and energetically high-spirited, like a marriage of high modernism and Merrie Melodies. In the late 1940s, Lewis Jacobs observed that Bute\u2019s films were \u201ccomposed upon mathematical formulae depicting in ever-changing lights and shadows, growing lines and forms, deepening colors and tones, the tumbling, racing impressions evoked by the musical accompaniment.\u201d Bute herself wrote that she sought to \u201cbring to the eyes a combination of visual forms unfolding along with the thematic development and rhythmic cadences of music.\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l2MNhUT6zdTJ4Bk8ZSzNpNSycSQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
