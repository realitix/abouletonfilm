A curious student, disturbed by his encounters with online pornography, sets out on an ill-conceived search for revenge in the icy darkness of Iceland's capital. Three days in the permanent winter darkness of Reykjavik, the freezing city provides a backdrop for a story of revenge. Ingvar, a country-boy living in the capital to study, lodges with an alcoholic landlady, Laufey. Her love for Ingvar is obsessive and hopeless; she is trapped by her drinking and her agoraphobia. Ingvar should be happy with the joyful sex with his exuberant girlfriend, Ada, but he becomes transfixed by the deceit and dirty secrets of a new \"parent-porn\" website. His obsession pulls him tragically into the dark underbelly of the winter city.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rXNiqUYGFE1kRlIsytCjiCXKN1m.jpg", "actors": ["Ylfa Edelstein (Laufey)", "Albert Halld\u00f3rsson (Ingvar)", "\u00deur\u00ed\u00f0ur Bl\u00e6r J\u00f3hannsd\u00f3ttir (Ada)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
