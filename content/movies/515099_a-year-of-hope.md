It\u2019s shocking to hear young Tracy and Joshua talk about being drugged and sexually abused, about how they have to steal their clothes from clotheslines. Alternatively, we also see them surrounded by love, food and nurturing during their year with the Stairway Foundation in the rural Philippines. While there, they learn that their genitals are theirs and theirs alone. Meanwhile, we see police cadets being taught in the same open way about penises and vaginas. These future officers are obviously more uncomfortable about these discussions than the street children they will someday work to protect. As the children\u2019s conversations are cut with grainy shots of the streets of Manila, the contrast is obvious between the dark city and the sunny coast where children can be children again. But life on the street is always lurking in the background.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8T7tbqLAW5Wve8zjipxTvq3bWRx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
