Originally conceived as the composers first operetta, the work is an artful blend of opera and operetta, with a lighter mood than Puccinis other works. This live production filmed at the Deutsche Oper Berlin stars Dinara Alieva and Charles Castronovo in the lead roles. Renowned stage director Rolando Villazon sets this rendition, and the Orchestra and Chorus of the Deutsche Oper Berlin is conducted here by acclaimed Maestro Roberto Rizzi Brignoli.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hgmEkh016xwAhlm6ezOQYrmtA6.jpg", "actors": ["Dinara Alieva (Magda)", "Charles Castronovo (Ruggero)", "Alexandra Hutton (Lisette)", "Alvaro Zambrano (Prunier)", "Roberto Rizzi Brignoli (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
