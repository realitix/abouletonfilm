This fictionalized story of Jana, an eight-year-old Gypsy girl snatched from her parents and consigned to a life of orphanages and bleak foster homes, is based on a little-known chapter of Swiss history: From 1926 to 1972, the state-supported Pro Juventute, a children's aid foundation, forcibly removed some 700 Gypsy children from their families, in order to sever the ties with their culture and assimilate them to a \"better way of life.\" The underlying aim was to preempt a new generation's caravans from following their nomadic traditions along Switzerland's country lanes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tCvtwZzTeYX3GlRmVjIINQ7NQXX.jpg", "actors": ["Jasmin Tabatabai (Jana Kessel)", "Andrea Eckert (Theresa Kessel)", "Hans-Peter Korff (Dr. Schoenefeld)", "Nina Petri (Fr\u00e4ulein Roth)", "Wolf-Dietrich Berg (Heinrich Hottinger)", "Herbert Leiser (Paul Kessel)", "Mathias Gn\u00e4dinger (Roger Kessel)", "Noemi Steuer (Andrina Kessel)", "Johanna Karl-Lory (Wahrsagerin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
