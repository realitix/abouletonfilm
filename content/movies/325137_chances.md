But Chance has a secret: Whatever he dreams at night becomes reality for 24 hours. It wasn't always this way. Chance was just a normal small-town kid until the day he stumbled upon a fortune teller with a mysterious power -- and a gift for the lonely boy: The Book of Ultimate Power, a book that makes his dreams come true.
