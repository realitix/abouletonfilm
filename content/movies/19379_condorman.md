I remember reading the book, oddly enough, when the movie came out, but didn't bother with the movie at the time. A shame, really, for I had loved Michael Crawford in the British TV series 'Doctor in the House', when I was a kid, and Oliver Reed and Barbara Carrera always offer great value to the cinephile.\r\n\r\nWorthy of respect, especially if you have kids around. A Disney live-action movie that hasn't aged half-badly."}], "recommandations_id": [109167, 51107, 64875, 210599]}
