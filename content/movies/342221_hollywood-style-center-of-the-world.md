It starts with a vignette in rural America. A mother and daughter go to town to buy a new dress. In the dress shop window is a designer dress worn by Joan Crawford in a recent movie. We then go to Hollywood and visit Adrian, MGM's chief of costume design, and see how multiple copies of a single clothing pattern are produced. The film ends with short segments of several MGM features.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iPfa4Dn2N48l2oTd7aCHo4doZsJ.jpg", "actors": ["Ann Morriss (Mary)", "Naomi Childers (Mary's Mother)", "George Lessey (Mary's Father)", "May McAvoy (Saleslady)", "Adrian (Himself)", "Lew Ayres (Himself)", "Lionel Barrymore (Himself)", "Wallace Beery (Himself)", "Bruce Cabot (Himself)", "Claudette Colbert (Herself)", "Joan Crawford (Herself)", "Nelson Eddy (Himself)", "Clark Gable (Himself)", "Greta Garbo (Herself)", "Judy Garland (Herself)", "Fay Holden (Herself)", "Marsha Hunt (Herself)", "Hedy Lamarr (Herself)", "Vivien Leigh (Herself)", "Myrna Loy (Herself)", "Jeanette MacDonald (Herself)", "Fredric March (Himself)", "Chico Marx (Himself)", "Groucho Marx (Himself)", "Harpo Marx (Himself)", "Ilona Massey (Herself)", "Frank Morgan (Himself)", "Maureen O'Sullivan (Herself)", "Laurence Olivier (Himself)", "Cecilia Parker (Herself)", "Eleanor Powell (Herself)", "William Powell (Himself)", "Mickey Rooney (Himself)", "Rosalind Russell (Herself)", "Ann Rutherford (Herself)", "Norma Shearer (Herself)", "Ann Sothern (Herself)", "James Stewart (Himself)", "Lewis Stone (Himself)", "Robert Taylor (Himself)", "Spencer Tracy (Himself)", "Johnny Weissmuller (Himself)", "Robert Young (Himself)", "Frank Whitbeck (Narrator)", "Greer Garson (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
