He can pick someone out, after bribing the boss of the institution, with two bottles of vodka. He chooses Vova, at first sight a silly man, and takes him home. His wife is at first not very happy with this choice. Vova says and does nothing at all. Then he becomes an aggressive man, who terrorises the house and bashes everything to pieces. After she is raped by Vova, the wife gets sexually dependant on the Idiot. Vova isn't interested anymore, when she gets pregnant and doesn't keep the baby. The idiot goes now to the intellectual for his sexual needs. The wife can't take this anymore and forces her man to take a choice: Vova out, or she will go.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Anzhelika Nevolina ()", "Anatoli Romantsov ()", "Anatoli Romantsov ()", "Viktor Khozyainov ()", "Sergey Migitsko ()", "Viktor Mikhaylov (Storozh v psikhushke)", "Aleksey Poluyan ()", "Olga Samoshina ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
