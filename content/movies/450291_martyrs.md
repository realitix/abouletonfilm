The work has no sound. It lasts for seven minutes.  Martyrs was joined in 2016 by a second piece entitled Mary. The installations have been gifted to Tate, and are on long-term loan to St Paul\u2019s Cathedral.  Bill Viola's commission for St Paul\u2019s Cathedral follows the great historical tradition of commissions for spiritual centres that has resulted in a priceless heritage of art around the world.  The result of this commission sees St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, which has always spearheaded the engagement of great artists, house a resonant work of art for our times. Martyrs (and later Mary), will play an important role in connecting contemporary issues with the timeless themes embodied in the cathedral.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e0YM03v9o3kxgGkPKLrI1TFDsmi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
