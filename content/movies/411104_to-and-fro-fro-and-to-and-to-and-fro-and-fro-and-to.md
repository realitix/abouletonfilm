With the camera static, the video opens with the ashtray in the center of the screen. A hand approaches from above and slides the object up and down, then back up and back down. Each time an act is completed, the hand retreats from the object, marking a separation from the next \u201cpossibility.\u201d The actions (or movements) mimic language (e.g. \u201cto and fro\u201d) as it is spoken.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3sNl7aOc40pFXcWwiZqbvOnknUU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
