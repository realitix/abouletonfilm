But at night, these seemingly peaceful and quiet hospitals are throbbing with a different kind of action altogether, the kind of action generated by the \u201cNightshift Nurses\u201d. Legendary stud John Leslie has moved behind the camera for his directorial debut. \u201cNightshift Nurses\u201d is a careening, slam-bang adult comedy that is as arousing as it is hilarious. No sexual combo is left to the imagination as the \u201cNightshift Nurses\u201d bring their unique bedside manner to their patients, the doctors and even the well-hung black janitor! Modern medicine may never be the same!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wONwUsE6xDRIhzJWFwsKfobOFAu.jpg", "actors": ["Dana Dylan (Nurse)", "Lynn Francis (Lisa)", "Joey Silvera (Idaho Moe)", "Steve Henessy (Edwin Justice)", "D.J.
