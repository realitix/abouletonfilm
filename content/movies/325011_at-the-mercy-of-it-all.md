I had this image of a man, his face covered in dirt, but his arms still moving and his eyes open. Body and soil. The image reminded me of the kind of parallels artist Robert Smithson made between geological change and the fragility of the mind, which in turn gave me the emotional content of the film. To quote Smithson, \"One's mind and the earth are in a constant state of erosion, mental rivers wear away abstract banks, brain waves undermine cliffs of thought, ideas decompose into stones of unknowing, and conceptual crystallizations break apart into deposits of gritty reason.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lCZsE2oy4JJF9ojsKCTmCZB1Iee.jpg", "actors": ["Todd Schrock (Man)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
