It\u2019s a recording of her No. 9 theatre tour, on its closing night at Carr\u00e9, when she played the concert to a fully-booked auditorium at the theatre.  The audience is treated to a glittering performance which is a potent mix of both music and theatre. Electronic sounds and spectacular beats go hand in hand with a classical string ensemble and delicate piano pieces.  Alongside the No. 9 repertoire in English, and two tracks in Dutch, ADEM UIT and DE WERELD BEWEEGT, the track list also includes four new tracks: SLOWLY, AS THE LADY WALKS ALONG, UNDERNEATH and SOFT SUMMER SYMPHONY.  Special arrangements and orchestration by: Joost van den Broek.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eWt5aTzLUa1iS2FT5sZPELTaisF.jpg", "actors": ["Wende Snijders ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
