It stars Rock Hudson, Yvonne De Carlo, Maxwell Reed, Denis O\u2019Dea, Michael Goodlife and Bryan Forbes. Music is by Richard Addinsell and cinematography by Wilkie Cooper.\r\n\r\n\"Guernsey in the Channel Islands near the coast of France in the year 1800, where fishermen, prevented by war from following their usual livelihood, turned to other occupations...\" \r\n\r\nThat occupation is of course smuggling, which lends one to think that Sea Devils is about to buckle our swash with a tale of derring do on the high seas. Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t pan out that way, for the pic is essentially a spy adventure set partly at sea that involves Hudson and De Carlo going backwards and forwards between England and France. They bicker, they swoon, she looks sexy, he takes his shirt off, he makes dumb decisions (he\u2019s no dashing hero type here) and she does her bit for King and Country as she hopes to stop Napoleon in his watery tracks. It\u2019s nicely colourful, the costuming adequate and the cast are fun to watch. But Walsh lets the film meander at times and it never really amounts to being more than a dressed up time filler of a movie. 6/10"}], "recommandations_id": [27978, 76121, 62804, 78315]}
