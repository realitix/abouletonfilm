In fact, everywhere he goes, he meets prospective customers on all sides of the conflict with his all-inclusive greeting \"Friends, Comrades.\" Indeed, the resource he is wrenching from the earth's bowels is necessary to all forms of industrial activity, and is especially necessary for military applications. Thus, he has no reason to fear that he will ever run out of customers. This doesn't prevent him from using every possible means to entice them. At home, his relationship with his wife is not so prosperous, and they resort to some extraordinary means to try and keep on an even keel.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6v4dzKpqe1FDiSLVjCszoY5WY1p.jpg", "actors": ["Mikk Mikiver ()", "Stina Ekblad ()", "Hannu Lauri ()", "Paavo Liski ()", "Elle Kull (Rouva)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
