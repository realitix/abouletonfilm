This powerful emotional journey begins with the Waodani describing their way of life before the missionaries visited them in 1956. Narrated by the son of one of the missionaries and each of the wives of the men who died, the audience takes a nostalgic trip back in time to see how the men and women came to meet up with each other in Ecuador. An inspiring story of forgiveness and love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/14iFE7mSUZTTERMlOZ4CtqT6aMf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "4Ixthl4ODAc"}
