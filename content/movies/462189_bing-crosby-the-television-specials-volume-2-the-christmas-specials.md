It was only natural for the voice that sold more than 100 million copies of 'White Christmas' to eventually celebrate the season on television. This second volume of Crosby television specials showcases those Christmas shows. Included in this premiere, two-disc collection are Bing's first holiday special, produced in England in 1961, his first color special from 1962 with Mary Martin, Bing Crosby and the Sounds of Christmas with Robert Goulet and Mary Costa from 1971, and Bing s final special, Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas, which includes the iconic duet of 'The Little Drummer Boy / Peace on Earth' with David Bowie. These treasured programs have been meticulously restored from the original film and videotape sources, and are presented with all the original performances intact.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/walm6lernVTSu0qITe5ED8VSgjf.jpg", "actors": ["Bing Crosby (Himself)", "Bob Hope (Himself)", "Mary Martin (Herself)", "Kathryn Crosby (Herself)", "David Bowie (Himself)", "Robert Goulet (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
