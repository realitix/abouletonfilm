In the first tale, Aurora has gotten used to a cozy, wealthy life, but begins to see her world destroyed when her husband is caught in bed with his secretary. Later, he flees the country to avoid getting arrested for something else he has done. Carmela is just welcoming her wayward son back to their slum home after he has spent a stint in \"reform\" school. Not only has he just confessed to her that he's gay, but he has become a heroin addict.Finally, Libera works at a newsstand outside of Naples as the sole breadwinner for her family. She is tired of her husband lounging in their house when he is not out tomcatting around with prostitutes, and decides to do something about it. So she secretly has him filmed in bed, and is marketing the tapes at her newsstand.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uKDS572G83RPqhaS9mkZYLz5eqq.jpg", "actors": ["Iaia Forte (Aurora / Italia / Libera)", "Cristina Donadio (Amica di Aurora / Carmela)", "Ciro Piscopo (Sebastiano)", "Enzo Moscato (Don Arcangelo)", "Antonino Bruschetta (Pistoletta)", "Cinzia Mirabella (Miriam)", "Vincenzo Peluso (Ragazzo della bancarella)", "Fiorenzo Serra (Cognato di Aurora / Barbiere / Il Pornomane)", "Pina Cipriani (Madre di Italia / Vigilante)", "Fabiana Forte (Sorella di Aurora / Amica di Italia)", "Anna Avitabile (Sisina / 2.Amica di Italia / Tabu')", "Paola Iovinella (Amica di Aurora / 3.Amica di Italia / Immacolata)", "Marinella Anaclerio (Amante di Tanino)", "Paola Chiarelli (Sorella di Italia)", "Tosca D'Aquino (Amica di Aurora)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
