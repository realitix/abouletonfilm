Getting ready to take a break from reality for a while, Officer Bob Butterfield agrees to one last job, a few hundred miles away, at an abandon amusement park on a private island. With two x Marines joining on the journey as Community Service Officers, no better way to keep the ten Community Service Workers in line, right? The owner of the amusement park, a cracked out clown, and his pal, \"a little person\", are always on premise and loves to put on a good show for the very few who find this island. The question is, will they be the ones putting on the show.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/krWdDsXLGMvdnHUDX4uqKk2WErM.jpg", "actors": ["Mindy Robinson (Daisy)", "Shawn C.
