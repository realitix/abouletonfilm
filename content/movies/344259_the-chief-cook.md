It is obvious from their reactions, particularly the cook (Leo White) that whatever was said did not go down too well.  His animated arms knock down the man standing behind him repeatedly until all three servants simultaneously quit.  They storm off into the adjoining kitchen where a slavery maid (Blanche White) is on the floor scrubbing the floor.  The men all trip over her, moan briefly and then leave.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/29s9rDF6BDnPqXJV9Ogy7niR1MY.jpg", "actors": ["Billy West (The Star Boarder)", "Bud Ross (Boggs)", "Oliver Hardy (Babe)", "Joe Cohen ()", "Leo White (Ham)", "Blanche White (Maggie)", "Polly Bailey ()", "Ethelyn Gibson (The Soubrette)", "Ellen Burford (Dolly)", "Joe Bordeaux (Hotel ex-employee)", "Florence McLaughlin (Hotel Guest)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
