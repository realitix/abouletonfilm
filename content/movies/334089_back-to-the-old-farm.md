Going to his friend, George Randall, Clayton shows him Barnes' letter asking that George be brought along, as he has always been like a son to him and that someone will be glad to see him. George agrees to go and that night has a dream of the old days on the Barnes farm, where he worked as a young fellow and loved Barnes' pretty daughter, Mollie. Toiling on the old-fashioned place becomes irksome to him and he determines to seek his fortune in the city. Packing up his few things, he leaves a note for Barnes, then steals away in the moonlight and comes upon Mollie in the garden.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["William Bailey (George Randall)", "E.H.
