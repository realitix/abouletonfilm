Love's Labour's Lost tells the story of four best friends who swear off love. The King of Navarre and his three companions swear a very public oath to study together and to renounce women for three years. Their honour is immediately put to the test by the arrival of the Princess of France and her three lovely companions. It's love at first sight for all concerned followed by the men's highly entertaining but hopeless efforts to disguise their feelings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c4xhS7U7aQwvtVOokQdaWdqJ16s.jpg", "actors": ["Jimmy Yuill (Constable Dull)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
