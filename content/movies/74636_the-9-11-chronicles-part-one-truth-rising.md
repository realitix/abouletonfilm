Truth Rising reveals and challenges the astounding arrogance and negligence of the government in regard to the heroic efforts of first responders, police, and fire-fighters. Truth Rising indicts the administration of Rudy Giuliani and that of the EPA and Christine Todd Whitman, who proclaimed the air in lower Manhattan was safe to breathe, contrary to numerous warnings to the contrary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e66sYeCE37G7sgcMZaTBOPEw61K.jpg", "actors": ["Alex Jones (himself)", "Luke Rudkowski (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
