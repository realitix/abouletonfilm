In this production by the distinguished film director, John Schlesinger, with spectacular designs by Maria Bjornson and William Dudley, Offenbach's nightmare world is brought to life. The all-star cast is headed by Placido Domingo as Hoffmann: his three loves are Ileana Cotrubas, Anges Baltsa and Luciana Serra and the manifestations of his rival are sung by Geraint Evans, Robert Lloyd, Siegmund Nimsgern and Nicola Ghiuselev. The score, which includes such favourites as the \"Barcarolle\" and the \"Doll's Song\", is conducted by Georges Pretre.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tq3IgcrXLjybkba8NoJAkKHV1xA.jpg", "actors": ["Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (Hoffmann)", "Agnes Baltsa (Giulietta)", "Robert Lloyd (Lindorf)", "Ileana Cotrubas (Antonia)", "Luciana Serra (Olympia)", "Geraint Evans (Copp\u00e9lius)", "Nicolai Ghiuselev (Miracle)", "Gwynne Howell (Crespel)", "Claire Powell (Nicklaus/Muse)", "Siegmund Nimsgern (Dapertutto)", "Philip Gelling (Schlemil)", "Francis Egerton (Pittichinaccio)", "Phyllis Cannan (Spirit of Antonia's Mother)", "Eric Garrett (Luther)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
