The film profiles her, unveiling her personality, travelling with her on a journey across her city, Lisbon, visiting the places that she most loves and knows so well, exposing herself as a free and open, generous and lively, innocent but wise woman, with the straightforwardness and a certain spice full of prudishness that are so identifying to Aldina Duarte.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/egpihpe5igOl2o9zyVqBykYSuEi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
