Again, it\u2019s Bob rather than Terry who is visibly distressed by this. Upset and much the worse for free alcohol, Bob then storms into the library to seek sympathy from Thelma - who is, predictably, unimpressed. So when Thelma finds out that Terry has been getting semi-serious with glamorous Finnish shop assistant Chris, she takes it upon herself to try and pair them off for good via planning first a dinner party and then that mainstay of 70s comedy, a camping expedition. Of course, things don\u2019t go quite according to plan and before you can say \u2018I can see the way this is going\u2019 we are set up for japes, larks and embarrassing incidents aplenty, which culminate in the lads getting rather fed up with their partners\u2019 attempts to inflict the rugged outdoor lifestyle upon them and trying to hitch up and drive off with the girls still asleep in the caravan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8yg1dPdpX8tqbHYJEgS0awwfWhw.jpg", "actors": ["James Bolam (Terry)", "Rodney Bewes (Bob)", "Brigit Forsyth (Thelma)", "Mary Tamm (Christina)", "Sheila Fearn ()", "Zena Walker ()", "Alun Armstrong ()", "Judy Buxton ()", "Vicki Michelle ()", "Michelle Newell ()", "Penny Irving ()", "Susan Tracy ()", "Gordon Griffin ()", "Edward Wilson ()", "Ronald Lacey ()", "Elizabeth Lax ()", "Linda Robson ()", "Ian McDiarmid ()", "Eric Mason (Truck Driver)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [38381, 61643, 38385, 38384], "youtube_key": "kGFr08_iBx4"}
