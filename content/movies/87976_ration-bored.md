When he goes to the gas station for a refill, he doesn't even know what a ration book is. The attendant thinks Woody is a wise guy and takes a large mallet and knocks him and his car into a junkyard several miles away. What luck! The old cars still have a bit of gas in them. Woody takes a rubber hose and siphons the gasoline from some of them. Unluckily, one of the cars he picks is brand new. And it's a cop car. Woody is soon at odds with a bulldog police officer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vMIdT7WMv4zxzL1GLnrGFlZT0JR.jpg", "actors": ["Mel Blanc (Woody Woodpecker (archive sound))", "Kent Rogers (Woody Woodpecker / Gas station attendant / Police officer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
