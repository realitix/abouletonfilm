It was inspired by a trip to Berlin in 2005. When Ian bought a souvenir t-shirt with the old East German communist symbol on it, he realised he needed to learn about life in East Germany (the DDR, the Deutsche Demokratische Republik) before he could wear it.  And so, he returned to Berlin with his camcorder and set about gathering stories from both the East and West. These stories and the people that tell them help Ian on his quest to understand what life was like in East Germany.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
