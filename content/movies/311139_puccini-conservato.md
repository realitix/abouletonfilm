The source of the sound (the loudspeakers) in a continuous hand-held panning (guided by the music), is intercut with shots of flowers or wood-fire, exemplifying the lyricism in Puccini\u2019s music. By being a recording of a recording, the work proclaims the artificiality of the sound. However the beauty and humanity of the music comes through too.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g0Fv5RiRLgmKUYrPC0SnByZhgB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
