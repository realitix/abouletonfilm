Through the magic of the camera, LightFilled Productions has taken available photographs and recreated the First Goetheanum \u2013 beginning with construction. The camera guides the viewer along an intimate tour of the forms and expanses of this unique building. After the fire of 1924, we see the debris cleared and a new building rise out of its ashes. At the end, we are treated to a view of the surrounding buildings that have been built nearby \u2013 inspired by Steiner\u2019s vision of architecture.  The effect of this tour is heightened by the absence of narration, with music being the only sound as one \u201cwalks\u201d along, pausing to look at these remarkable structures.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
