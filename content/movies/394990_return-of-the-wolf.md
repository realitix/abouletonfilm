The death of big Wolf 38, the original alpha male of the pack, is depicted with heart-breaking clarity. The loss of the alpha male is resolved when a Rose Creek male, Wolf 21, encounters the Druid pack in a never-before-filmed sequence of tenuous first-time introductions and eventual acceptance. Wolf 21 is the current alpha male of the pack to this day and his pack take-over stands out as one of the finest moments of wild wolf behaviour captured on film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zGauSTEaplys0ZCqkzF5irZil3e.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
