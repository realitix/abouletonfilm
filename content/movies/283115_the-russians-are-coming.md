G\u00fcnter is 16 and firmly believes that the Germans will win the war. During the hunt for a forced labourer who is on the run, G\u00fcnter catches him and watches as he is shot to death. He proudly accepts the award of an Iron Cross before being shipped to the nearby front as part of the last contingent of troops. He is quickly captured by Soviet soldiers, but manages to escape and return home. When the town is occupied by the Red Army, G\u00fcnter is arrested for the murder of the forced labourer. The film was banned in 1968 before it was completed, and a large portion of the negative was later destroyed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4zGiZipcEjuUdwINs7HrKPAj1YX.jpg", "actors": ["Rolf Ludwig (Vater Walcher)", "Peter Bause (deutscher Soldat)", "Dorothea Meissner (Christine)", "Norbert Christian (Vater Bergschicker)", "Karla Runkehl (Mutter Bergschicker)", "Gert Krause-Melzer ()", "Viktor Perevalov ()", "Vsevolod Safonov ()", "Lissy Tempelhof ()", "Hans Hardt-Hardtloff ()", "Claus K\u00fcchenmeister ()", "Ulrich Teschner ()", "Katja Paryla ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
