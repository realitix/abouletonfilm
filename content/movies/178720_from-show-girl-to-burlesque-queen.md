A smiling, dark-haired woman enters through the door on stage right, unbuttoning a full-length polka-dot costume. As she undresses, she frequently looks directly at the camera and smiles. She removes her sash or cummerbund, the top with its trailing sleeves, and her skirt, leaving her clothed only in a sleeveless chemise. Smiling directly at the camera, she mischievously slips a strap of the garment off one shoulder, then ducks behind the screen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gz1TyUoLvC26iGXzlaQukeiN45j.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [178703], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
