Being a divorce lawyer, marriage is more of a horror show to him as woman are - in his eyes- wonderful creatures that desire one thing: to trap you forever! A crazy inmate who will do anything to stop his divorce, an obsessive mother who wants him settled, two very demanding twins in search of a husband, and a wife-dependent taxi-driver are his world... until the sky strikes and he finds himself in an abandoned buss stop, at the mercy of a beautiful brunette.The smarter he becomes in avoiding the luring traps build by women around him, the more impossible it becomes to escape forever... because in the end, love is a game and the winner sometime is the one who doesn't like to play.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9tUDGIRZAavqvGsTTuCHOc1H9XI.jpg", "actors": ["Ermal Mamaqi (Riku)", "Enxhi Cuku (Ada)", "Zamira Kita (Dyshka)", "Robert Aliaj (Agron)", "Salsano Rrapi (Andreas)", "Erjona Kakeli (Ardita)", "Olta Daku (Nada / Leda)", "Roland Saro (Erlisi)", "Ina Gjon\u00e7aj (Eva)", "Xheni Halluli (Lona)", "Marko Bitraku (Mjeku Popullor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "tXaVuzF2kYo"}
