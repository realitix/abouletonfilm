Today, Beckie just returns from five years spent in Japan, and it is for her and Mark their first opportunity to meet again after all these years she spent abroad .

Throughout this day nothing happens as both pictured this reunion. Louisa, the young model, will also be a catalyst for all their moods. Who will win from this experience? Who will have been played by the other ? And for what purpose? This film talks about manipulations and lies. The ones that are told to others and those of whom one dwells. Illusions.
