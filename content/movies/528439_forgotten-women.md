Kate Allison drinks to forget playboy Andy Emerson, whom she might have married if her husband, John Allison hadn't come home before the divorce was final, which is no big deal as actors Norris and Douglas were pretty much interchangeable anyway; Ruth Marshall is reunited with husband Richard Marshall on the pleas of their son in the divorce court of Judge Donnell; and Clair Dunning makes up with husband Bill Dunning after they meet in the bar. Most of what passes for action is a couple of car wrecks, understandable considering the amount of sauce consumed in Harry's bar.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j4A5aC9tAKDqpYmKJpB1C6QS6eA.jpg", "actors": ["Elyse Knox (Kate Allison)", "Edward Norris (Andy Emerson)", "Robert Shayne (Richard Marshall)", "Theodora Lynch (Ruth Marshall)", "Veda Ann Borg (Clair Dunning)", "Noel Neill (Ellen Reid)", "Tim Ryan (Harry)", "Bill Kennedy (Bill Dunning)", "Warren Douglas (John Allison)", "Selmer Jackson (Judge Donnell)", "Paul Frison (Gary)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
