{"tmdb_id": 295238, "title": "Coatti", "original_title": "Coatti", "slug_title": "coatti", "date": "1977-09-26", "genre": [""], "score": "7.0/10", "synopsis": "Stavros and Charlotte - i.e. the director and his partner in life and art, Charlotte van Gelder - are wandering the streets of a burdensome reality like immigrants, tracing the world around them through friendships, journeys and political quests.  Made with minimal means with a few rolls of black and white film they managed to scrape together, this is a thoroughly unconventional film that defies traditional narrative structures, spectacularly revealing the director's true vision: a primordial cinema full of imagery that comes out of nowhere and communicates freely, like a small wonder.  A large slice of the international film critic community - including Frenchman Louis Skorecki who described the film as a comet - will adore \"Coatti\" and continue to support Tornes' lonely path until the end.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hD9nU0Ox9UYiWZwa8yrpVrq5Eg3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
