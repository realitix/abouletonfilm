Because of his naive, friendly approach and helpfulness, his wife walks out on him and the police have doubts about his sanity. Is Damjan really losing his memory like his father did before him? And does purity of mind and spirit necessarily lead to a person's downfall? Will Damjan, who is mysteriously attracted and connected to the cinema and who finds himself drawn into a case of mistaken identity (just like in the movies) succeed in setting his life in order in spite of the mix-up and in finding the right companion for himself?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Marko Mla\u010dnik (Damjan Petri\u010d)", "Maja Boh (Irtev)", "Emil Cerar (\u010crpalkar)", "Ivo Godni\u010d (Natakar)", "Tone Kob\u0161e (Mili\u010dnik v civilu)", "Jurij Korenc (Ljubimec)", "Vlado Kreslin (Neznanec)", "Gojmir Le\u0161njak - Gojc (Doktor Cerar)", "Andreja Lu\u017enik (Mlado dekle)", "Nata\u0161a Matja\u0161ec (Mlada voza\u010dka)", "Bernarda Oman (Jana Petri\u010d)", "Max Osole (Bolni\u010dar)", "Olga Pajek (Zdravnica)", "Sandi Pavlin (Psihiater)", "Toma\u017e Pipan (Mili\u010dnik)", "Barbara Lapajne-Predin (Mija)", "Franci Retelj (Zdravnik)", "Mladen Robnik (Mili\u010dnik v civilu)", "Lojze Rozman (Damjanov o\u010de)", "Luka Simoni (Zlatar)", "Damjan Uli\u010devi\u010d (Panker)", "Metoda Zor\u010di\u010d (Sestra v intenzivni)", "Vlado Novak ()", "Pavle Ravnohrib ()", "Silva \u010cu\u0161in ()", "Marjan Hlastec ()", "Vesna Jevnikar ()", "Bo\u0161tjan Hladnik ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
