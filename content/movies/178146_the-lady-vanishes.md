But her expectations of peace are short-lived when, at the railway station, Iris wavers in the scorching heat and constant jostle of passengers, fainting suddenly on the platform. She wakes in time to be rushed onto the train, but with a pounding head and a feeling of being almost in a dream. Whilst in this malaise she is comforted by an older English lady called Miss Froy, but when Iris falls asleep she awakes to find Miss Froy has gone and her fellow passengers denying she ever existed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cjvWgUjcs6A7iYQVl8sF63wYZx0.jpg", "actors": ["Tuppence Middleton (Iris Carr)", "Tom Hughes (Max Hare)", "Keeley Hawes (Mrs Todhunter)", "Julian Rhind-Tutt (Mr Todhunter)", "Alex Jennings (The Professor)", "Stephanie Cole (Evelyn Floodporter)", "Gemma Jones (Rose Floodporter)", "Selina Cadell (Miss Froy)", "Jesper Christensen (The Doctor)", "Daisy Lewis (Diana)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "BmYTkfXGwPg"}
