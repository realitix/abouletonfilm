Dix's father (Frank Currier) wants Dix to get away from his many girlfriends and buckle down to work, so Currier sends Dix to an obscure village in Spain to find samples of a rare mineral. When Dix gets to Spain, he runs afoul of the local police chief, played by William Powell in an excellent performance. Powell is remembered for the suave leading roles he played in the sound era, but in silent films he was typecast as a villain. In \"Too Many Kisses\", Powell has a secret which he tries to keep Dix from discovering.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/agI1GgYcE0E2qcGCC6yENT4UUZ4.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Dix (Richard Gaylord, Jr.)", "Frances Howard (Yvonne Hurja)", "William Powell (Julio)", "Frank Currier (Richard Gaylord, Sr)", "Harpo Marx (The Village Peter Pan)", "Paul Panzer (Pedro)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
