Stolid, conscientious Tom McCarthy, a New York detective, is sent after Anna and arrests her, chartering a steamer to bring her back to the United States. The steamer sinks, and Anna and Tom are stranded on a small island. They fall in love, and Tom's influence brings about a benign change in Anna's character. They are rescued, however, and Anna is placed on trial for her life. Tom takes the stand in her defense and informs the judge of Anna's conversion in the solitude of the island. The judge instructs Tom to marry Anna and then sentences them to life--on the island where they found happiness together.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8zvqorLE0C4zyetvAEf17lSwWp2.jpg", "actors": ["Milton Sills ()", "Dorothy Mackaill ()", "Gladden James ()", "Jed Prouty ()", "Sidney Bracey ()", "Gertrude Howard ()", "Marion Byron ()", "George Fawcett ()", "Frank Reicher ()", "August Tollaire ()", "Doris Dawson ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
