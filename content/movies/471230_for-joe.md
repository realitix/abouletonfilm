A collage of images and sounds playfully portraying the technical process of capturing and displaying film, Schlemowitz is perhaps sardonically directing his camera upon us, the audience. Simultaneously a portrait of precision and a celebration of the coarseness of film itself, FOR JOE evokes the rhythms and spectacle of capturing image in an earlier era of filmmaking. - Stela Jelincic", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r9PW0Xt9vyrxn4Oc2SzasZhORWF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
