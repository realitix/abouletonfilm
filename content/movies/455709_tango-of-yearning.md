Taking its title from Tango of Hope, a classic ballad by Nur al-Huda, the film draws from the director\u2019s reflections on war, love, and cinema, as well as his personal experience at the public television channel T\u00e9l\u00e9Liban. Conjuring various snippets of audiovisual archival material, the film is a poetic elegy to film, Beirut\u2019s movie theaters, and a city undergoing radical transformation.  Mohamed Soueid has long been a proponent of the experimental video documentary movement in Lebanon, playing a significant role in the country\u2019s creative renaissance since the end of the civil war.
