In combat situations in World War II, gliders were used to transport men and materiel to sites not suitable for landing powered aircraft, and the gliders were constructed so that they could be reused. The preparation of the grounded glider is explained, as well as the preparations and maneuvers aboard the C-47 aircraft which will pick up the glider.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Ronald Reagan (Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
