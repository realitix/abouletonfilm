Thanks to the chicanery of his crooked uncle Major Cosgrave (Jim Davis), Jet has been cheated out of his father's property and branded a pariah. He spends the rest of the film trying to regain his birthright and clear his name. The two women in Jet's life are Judy Polsen (Joan Evans), who chases him for so long that he finally catches her, and Alice Austin (Catherine McLeod), Major Cosgrave's fianee. The supporting cast is dotted with such weatherbeaten western \"regulars\" as Slim Pickens, Bob Steele and Harry Carey Jr.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/52NMYf6g9LCfA6ha4PM8AuD0Gz5.jpg", "actors": ["John Derek (Jet Cosgrave)", "Joan Evans (Judy Polsen)", "Jim Davis (Major Linton Cosgrave)", "Catherine McLeod (Alice Austin)", "Nana Bryant (Mrs. Banner)", "Slim Pickens (Boone Polson)", "Frank Ferguson (Chad Polson)", "Nicolas Coster (Asa Polson)", "James Millican (Cal Prince)", "Bob Steele (Dude Rankin)", "Nacho Galindo (Curly)", "Harry Carey, Jr. (Bert)", "Robert 'Buzz' Henry (Zeke Polsen)", "Bill Walker (Sam Allen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
