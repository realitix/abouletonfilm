Devoid of any moral judgment, the eye of the director studies the boundaries of human behaviour and explores how far an individual can go, driven by love and the spirit of survival. Andrea Pallaoro was born in Trento but at the age of 17 moved to California to study filmmaking. His short film Wunderkammer was presented at the Sundance Film Festival. This year he brings his first feature-length film to the Orizzonti section.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mbvzCVA1yXWLRbcE9QcJO8J1m6T.jpg", "actors": ["Catalina Sandino Moreno (Christina)", "Br\u00edan F.
