But later that night at a poker game with some shady characters, he gets more than he bargains for when Oswald loses a hefty bet he can't cover. With Oswald's family held hostage, Bruce is forced to pay the remainder of his debt by robbing the payroll office in a Reno casino but not before he spirals into degeneracy and loses big himself during the job.
