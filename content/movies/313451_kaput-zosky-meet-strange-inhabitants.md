Kaput is the squat one with a mohawk of red hair who thinks he's a martial arts specialist (yeah, right!). Zosky's the string bean-looking alien with yellow tendrils who's more laissez-faire about killing and mayhem. Together, they're irresistible as they stoop to conquer other worlds but always get their comeuppance.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
