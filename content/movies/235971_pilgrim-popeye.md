But Popeye can't bring himself to do the deed, so he tells them a story about the time he was a pilgrim and a turkey saved his life. Popeye is hunting the turkey, which keeps outsmarting him; he finally corners the bird, which gives him a sob story about being too scrawny to eat. Popeye gives him some spinach, but before the bird can eat it, Popeye is captured by Indians. They tie him to a stake. The turkey, watching, remembers the spinach, which turns the turkey into an eagle. He swoops down, carries off the first batch of Indians and throws them into a mountain; he turns another batch into a totem pole. Popeye finishes his story and sees the boys missing; dinner time! They prepare to serve the turkey his big plate of spinach.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jack Mercer (Popeye/Nephews/Turkey (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
