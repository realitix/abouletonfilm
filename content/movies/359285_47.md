The moon raises over mountaintops, melts with the woods. A path dissolves with the view. Colors rendered liquid. Data holes vanish in the distance. Memory, processing, nothing lasts forever. A hike through a natural reservoir; recorded, saved, consolidated. A landscape interpretation by means of MPEG algorithms. In #47, alternating fixed camera shots and pans display a landscape from the hiker\u2019s point of view. Where the path leads to, remains unclear. #47 belongs to a video-work series, researching the relationship between landscape- representation, perception and the unconscious. The technics applied to the footage are a mix between some hacking of the MPEG-information and faulty encoding settings. During this process, crucial data is removed from the MPEG-stream and fed back to the computer to make it \u2018work\u2019, forcing software to re-interpret the visual information.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tL2jk3mBknVBgkTr86VteF03n5P.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ilPUMBcGDAw"}
