The goal of the ongoing JOB project is to find and bring together the latest and greatest filmers and freeskiers every year, combining their talents under artistic direction, and creating a boundary breaking ski movie. The movie won the \"Coup de Coeur\" at iF3 2012 in Montreal and \"Best European Movie\" at iF3 2012 in Annecy!
