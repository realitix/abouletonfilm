More and more we think about what is 'beyond.' Less and less is art concerned. I don't know why. The question seems a bit grandiose but I approached it quite simply. I have never worked with color photography as primary background to cut-out animation before. I was surprised that the result was so powerful (helped by John Davis' very resonant music). It was liberating to release human figures into an apperception of suggested space, along with the primordial enigma of the revolving sphere.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x0IKwBV6GEWFApj35rxdlvduu1V.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
