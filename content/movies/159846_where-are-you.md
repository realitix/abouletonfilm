Ryo grew up fatherless, and has been trying to make a living by working at a local convenience store ever since his mother was hospitalized with a prolonged illness. Unable to support himself on his meager earnings, he has to resort to sneaking money from the cash register and stealing rice balls to get by-a habit which eventually gets him fired. Just when it seems things can't get any worse, his mother dies and he's stuck with a hefty bill for the hospital and funeral expenses. Obviously unable to pay, but determined to send his mother off himself, Ryo steals her corpse and places it in a small rowboat. After the makeshift funeral ceremony, Ryo heads off to Tokyo on a journey to meet his absentee father.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fM6aNKmXb4CG8viSZ2VPpgbAJ8Y.jpg", "actors": ["Yuto Kobayashi (Ryo Kawai)", "Masahiro Kobayashi (Kawai's Father)", "Makiko Watanabe (Kawai's Mother)", "Tokio Emoto ()", "Ry\u00fbz\u00f4 Tanaka ()", "Sanae Miyata ()", "Kazue Tsunogae ()", "Yukiyoshi Ozawa ()", "Megumi Yokoyama ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
