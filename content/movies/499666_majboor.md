One day Ravi brings home a poor girl Sharda to rehabilitate as she has no place to live after her dad expires. The family takes a liking to Sharda and subsequently arranges Ravi and Sharda's wedding. But on the wedding day a jailbird Jankidas suddenly arrives; claiming Sharda to be his wife and providing evidence to prove as such. Everyone is shocked including the Mayor, Kishanchand.
