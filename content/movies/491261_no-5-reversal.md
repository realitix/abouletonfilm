The film combines elements of horizontal and vertical montage in the soundtrack, using white noise, and radio static as a fragmentation device. The visually striking black and white photography weaves lyrical, pastoral nature with the de- and re- construction of civilization. No. 5 Reversal ends with a filmic signature, an image of its maker framed in front of a window against a backdrop of ruins.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lCebR8H6guy5wIeN8jxT8qEeBaR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
