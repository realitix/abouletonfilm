He soon earns a place in Erik's mob. Syndicate head Big John wishes to unite the four gangs in Chicago, but Erik defies them, wishing to remain independent. An assassination attempt forces him to reconsider, and his gang isn't impressed with what they take for his cowardice. This is the point that allows the ambitious Frank to muscle in on Erik's mob, and his moll, Lucie.

Erik, meanwhile, harbors feelings of revenge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gIht9O4zKIaYEsIv5q0WBCekNOp.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Lee Lawrence ()", "William Bogart ()", "Ingrid Schoeller ()", "Miguel Del Castillo ()", "Eduardo Fajardo ()", "Fernando S\u00e1nchez Polack ()", "Che Tejada ()", "Luis Induni ()", "Philippe Hersent ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
