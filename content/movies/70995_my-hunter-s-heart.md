It tracks the Khomani San of the Southern Kalahari, the oldest living indigenous tribe in the world, who are genetically linked to every human being on Planet Earth. In modern times, their traditional nomadic way of life has changed and westernisation has severed their link to the land and the animals. The film follows younger members of the clan, /Urugab and his family, as they embark on an epic journey to try to recapture some of the knowledge and skills of their ancestors.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1IP6K9kGdpNYlqOUA25zXBpum09.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "WRDkLrgKT5c"}
