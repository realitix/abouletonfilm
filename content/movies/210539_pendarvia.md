The album was recorded in a barn in rural Oregon. Pendarvia is heavily driven by the natural surroundings of the area, inter-cutting music with beautiful shots of the surrounding scenery. The film follows the abstractly linear narrative of the recording process, inter-cutting found moments of dialogue from the band, producer Tucker Martine, collaborators and friends. The film is a beautiful audio/visual collage that explores the trials and tribulations of the creative process.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jenny Conlee (Herself)", "Chris Funk (Himself)", "Tucker Martine (Himself)", "Colin Meloy (Himself)", "John Moen (Himself)", "Nate Query (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
