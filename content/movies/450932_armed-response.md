This is where the pleasant surprises end for Armed Response.\r\n\r\nYou know what I hate? When the shrill elongated beep that's supposed to cause the characters immense pain, actually causes pain to the audience. Well, Armed Response has that in spades. Seriously, have we not yet reached a place in filmmaking where we can indicate an intense noise other than that some bloody headache-inducing, ear-splitting 'EEEEEEEEEEEEE' they all use? Makes me want to turn off the movie immediately. Well, with Armed Response, I probably would have been better served if I had done just that.\r\n\r\nWhat a ridiculous 93 minutes that was.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"}], "recommandations_id": [476622, 471310, 434520, 41409], "youtube_key": "0p8Cl8_wQew"}
