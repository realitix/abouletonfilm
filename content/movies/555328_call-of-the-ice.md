Alone in the heart of the polar winter battling with the Arctic ice pack and its ruthless laws, Michael turns to the techniques, know-how and reflexes of the Inuits who have thrived in the Arctic for thousands of years. A story of the human journey, Call of the Ice is a film about learning, with its failures and pain, but also victories in the face of adversity.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Mike Magidson (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
