MARIACHI HIGH follows a South Texas high school's top ensemble, Mariachi Halcon, through one year of auditions and rehearsals, of heartbreak and joy, building to the state championship tournament, making a convincing case for the positive impact of in-school arts engagement on students' lives. One of the film's central themes is a connection between mariachi music for Latino youth and high achievement. As they compete and perform with musical virtuosity, these teens and the music they play will inspire, surprise, and bring you to your feet.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sLYY6NOIGlGKpwi1Ss9ruRbBAms.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
