The women chosen were selected because they represent the real diversity within both feminism and independent film and video. They range in age from 65 to 25. They are black, white, Puerto Rican, Yugoslavian, Asian American, biracial. They are straight, gay and bisexual. What they share is a need to express their own interpretations of what American culture is and could be and a belief that this work is made particularly powerful through the media.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ddM3U1vJPHSYRoGedn7UHRFCmfe.jpg", "actors": ["Frances Negr\u00f3n Muntaner (Herself)", "Pearl Bowser (Herself)", "Michelle Citron (Herself)", "Cheryl Dunye (Herself)", "Megan Cunningham (Herself)", "Vanalyne Green (Herself)", "Barbara Hammer (Herself)", "Kate Horsfield (Herself)", "Carol Leigh (Herself)", "Susan Mogul (Herself)", "Juanita Mohammed (Herself)", "Eve Oishi (Herself)", "Constance Penley (Herself)", "Wendy Quinn (Herself)", "Julia Reichert (Herself)", "Carolee Schneemann (Herself)", "Valerie Soe (Herself)", "Victoria Vesna (Herself)", "Yvonne Welbon (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
