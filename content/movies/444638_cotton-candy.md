For slightly more than an hour, Cotton Candy documents this venerable collection of coin-operated mechanical toys\u2014including an entire circus\u2014mainly in close-up, isolating particular details as he alternates between ambient and post-dubbed (or no) sound. By treating the Musee's cast of synchronized figures as puppets, the artist is making a show\u2014but is it his or theirs? Gehr's selective take on the arcade renders it all the more spooky. There's a sense in which Cotton Candy is a gloss on the moment in The Rules of the Game when the music-box-collecting viscount unveils his latest and most elaborate acquisition. (It also brings to mind the climax of A.I.: The DV of the future tenderly regards the more human machine of the past.)  (J. Hoberman, The Village Voice)", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Christine Casarsa (Little Girl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
