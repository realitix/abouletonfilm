Recalling Slidelength (1969-71), Michael Snow's slideshow of plastic gels and hand gestures, Pepper's Ghost is a prolonged expression of demystified mystification, whose startling results are bolstered by a bold soundtrack.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gS8yKVWxxtPATXSeQdiNBB6HZiE.jpg", "actors": ["Stephen Broomer ()", "Eva Kolcze ()", "Cameron Moneo ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
