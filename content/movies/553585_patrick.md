The remaining time he dedicates to his hobby, designing and creating furniture. When Patrick loses his campsite hammer, his quest to retrieve it takes him to the farthest corners of the camping grounds. Sure enough, when Patrick's father passes away, Patrick's quest turns existential. Patrick's safety bubble pops and everything he took for granted, changes. Is he mourning because of his father? Or is he thinking mostly about his lost hammer? In the meantime, the resident campers are beginning to question Patrick's leadership abilities, fearing for the survival of their beloved sanctuary.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Kevin Janssens (Patrick)", "Pierre Bokma (Herman)", "Hannah Hoekstra (Nathalie)", "Jemaine Clement ()", "Tine Van den Wyngaert (Sabrina)", "Katelijne Damen (Nelly)", "Bouli Lanners (Mon)", "Josse De Pauw (Rudy)", "Jan Bijvoet (Flik)", "Frank Vercruyssen (Wilfried)", "Peter Gorissen (Bert)", "Fran\u00e7oise Chich\u00e9ry (Florence)", "Jean-Beno\u00eet Ugeux (Le vendeur de marteaux)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
