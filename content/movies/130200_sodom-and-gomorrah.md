After almost driving her fiancee to suicide and seducing his mentally-ill son, she realizes through a metaphorical dream the scope of her negligence. Sentenced to prison for incitement to murder Harber, she sees herself as a parallel figure to Lea, Lot's wife in Sodom, where the Angel of the Lord warns the sinful citizens of the city of their impending doom. Lea oppresses the angel and eventually turns it over to the pagan priests when her sexual advances to it are rejected. In another dream sequence, Mary becomes the Queen of Syria, whose oppressed people turn against her and who, in turn, condemns a young man who loves her to death. Finally, her dream returns to the present time and when she awakens, she runs back to her former lover.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vAKCsRuCafIYttM2lWWo7QyFONc.jpg", "actors": ["Georg Reimers (Mr. Jackson Harber)", "Victor Varconi (Priester des Lyzeums - Engel des Herrn)", "Lucy Doraine (Mary Conway / Das Weib des Lot / Lia, K\u00f6nigin von Syrien)", "Erika von Wagner (Mrs. Agathe Conway - Marys Mutter)", "Walter Slezak (Eduard Harber - Student am Cambridge-Lyzeum / Ein Goldschmied von Galil\u00e4a)", "Kurt Ehrle (Harry Lighton - Bildhauer / Lot)", "Paul Askonas ()", "Richard Berczeller (Lot)", "Gyula Sz\u00f6reghy ()", "B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs (extra)", "Willi Forst (extra)", "Leo Slezak ()", "Hans Thimig ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
