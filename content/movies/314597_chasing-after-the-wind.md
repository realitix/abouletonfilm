Gustavo is a wild man living at a nostalgic place yearning for the lost essence of its past. Every night, Gethsemane becomes Gustavo's scene, while he slips into the dark corners of the neighborhood. This film is a contemplation of a shared impermanence, where Gethsemane's debris bears witness of the end of a community, but also of a human being.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xmlvJUvfuzOJVJeBVVUqiMSqh4l.jpg", "actors": ["Gustavo Hoyos ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
