Coco is an eleven-year-old kid who intensely wishes to be a grown-up, to be a man. A walk along the river with Johana -his new Venezuelan neighbor- initiates Coco in the adult world. But his father and life itself slow him down and make him feel small and insignificant; just a child. When life gets complicated it is probably best to let oneself go with the flow and float down the river like a drifting log.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mZH9JLRknzWaEma7vSXn1oybBLj.jpg", "actors": ["Leonardo Sbaraglia (Daniel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "8vx6hHRo6Z8"}
