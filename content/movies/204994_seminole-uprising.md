Kent from Curt Brandon's novel, Bugle's Wake. It stars George Montgomery, Karin Booth, William Fawcett, Steven Ritch, Ed Hinton and John Pickard.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry, led by Lieutenant Cam Elliott (Montgomery), are tasked with bringing in Seminole Indian chief Black Cat (Ritch), who is leading his tribe with ferocious force. But there are some family ties causing problems to the mission...\r\n\r\nThe problems with the pic are front and centre, the use of stock footage, dummies and cheap model work show it to be a low grade Western that needed a more astute production team at the control desks. However, narrative has some intelligence as per the half-breed issues, there's a simmering love rival shenanigan, while there's good \"B\" movie quality action sequences to hold the attention - the finale is particularly exciting with the rocks and fire tactics. It's no Western fan's idea of a must see movie, but the brisk pacing, some thought in the screenplay and a likable cast at least make it a decent enough \"once only\" time waster. 5/10"}], "recommandations_id": [233795, 148847, 121713, 121161]}
