To discarded travel and advertising footage found at a local film laboratory, Belson Shimane added a m\u00e9lange of animation\u2014assemblages, cutouts, color fields, and line drawings\u2014and faux hipster narration by Jacobs (credited via the anagram Rheny Bojacs) punctuated by a bongo backing. Strung together with doublespeak and non sequiturs, the monologue skirts the edge of nonsense as Jacobs waxes on about poetry, jazz, \u201creaching the public,\u201d \u201chaving a good time,\u201d and\u2014although \u201cmoney doesn\u2019t count\u201d\u2014the \u201cpossibility of subsidy\u201d through grants. Footage of champagne, tropical beaches, and exotic peoples intermingle with rhythmic drawings and stop-motion flights of fancy.
