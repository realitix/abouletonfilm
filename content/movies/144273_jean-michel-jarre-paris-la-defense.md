About 2.5 million people standing in front of the pyramidical stage all the way down to the Arc de Triomphe witnessed this event, setting a new Guinness Book of Records entry for Jarre. The concert was funded by Mairie De Paris, Ministry of Culture and a small cluster of high-profile Parisian business concerns. Later, a concert video as well as a photobook of the event were released.  The show featured new tracks from the Waiting for Cousteau album, and vast grotesque marionettes created by Trinidadian Peter Minshall.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rwXSW63nZdaXOrdaF3Jqaurcyoy.jpg", "actors": ["Jean Michel Jarre (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
