Filming in and around the capital of Jakarta, the cameras follow where chance leads, capturing the flavour of life in this fertile crescent of tropical islands. Throughout the film, the focus is on a society caught between the past and the conflicting options for the future - to change or not to change from long-established patterns of life to ones more influenced by western technology.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r3x1gUfk4Lx9FgQgWzEn0E7effQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
