The length of each filmstrip is determined by the distance between points on the artist\u2019s body, such as from fingertip to fingertip between outstretched arms, and bisecting the body along a posterior/anterior axis. During our experience of these moving images, the length of a strip of film becomes a measurement of time as the static marks incised into the black 16mm frames are perceived to be lines of light in motion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t50xBSTcUcrAYNBhxn3angIgvOm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
