Over the course of the game, we contemplate the physics, motion, pitfalls and beauty of this idiosyncratic sport. Created by Trent Parke and Narelle Autio in collaboration with Matthew Bate, Summation of Force VR is a virtual reinterpretation of their moving image work, placing you inside it. Dark, surreal and exquisitely beautiful, this virtual reality artwork uses cricket as a metaphor for life itself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mZFpN7ZZckRE7bmB9JSOed8eQkf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
