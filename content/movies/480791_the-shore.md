Hungering for some quality alone time with her new boyfriend, Ray (Costas Mandylor), single mother Kaliope Harris (Izabella Miko) leaves her young daughter, Anna (Erika Shasho), in the care of loving grandmother Mrs. Harris (Lesley Ann Warren). An idyllic day at the beach turns to tragedy for the Harris family, however, when in the blink of an eye the precious young Anna seemingly disappears into the vast sand. While Mrs. Harris struggles to accept the startling disappearance, her enraged husband (Ben Gazzara) hounds the authorities to step up their search and Kaliope and Ray comb the beach in a desperate bid to retrace Anna's every step on that fateful and tragic day.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ihwjhnpbhf2xT2tk6MEMbpYgesp.jpg", "actors": ["Izabella Miko ()", "Lesley Ann Warren ()", "Ben Gazzara ()", "Paula Garc\u00e9s ()", "Costas Mandylor ()", "Matt Newton ()", "Ashley Marie Talarico ()", "George Morafetis ()", "Andrea Langi ()", "Peter Patrikios ()", "Vince Dellapolla ()", "Mandy Brown ()", "Fred Wager ()", "Nicole Mayer ()", "Grace Rainer Long ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
