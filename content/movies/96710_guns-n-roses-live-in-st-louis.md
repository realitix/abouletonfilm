He asked the venue's security to take away the camera, and after a few seconds decided to take it himself, jumping into the audience and tackling the fan. He had a heated confrontation with the fan before physically assaulting him. After being pulled out of the audience by members of the crew, Rose said, \"Well, thanks to the lame-ass security, I'm going home!\", threw his microphone to the ground and stormed off stage. The angry crowd began to riot and dozens of people were injured.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hzaEchno85wodjAQtGQpmDV11kH.jpg", "actors": ["W.
