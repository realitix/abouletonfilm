Filmed in Europe 15 years apart, these two shows seen together provide an overview of Baker\u2019s illustrious career. The first show is a haunting 1964 performance in a Belgian TV studio with a quartet including long-time sidemen saxophonist Jacques Pelzer and French pianist Rene Urtreger. Songs include the Miles Davis classic, \u201cSo What,\u201d and the jazz standard \u201cTime After Time\u201d (a very rare rendition featuring Chet\u2019s \u201cCool\u201d vocal style.) The soulful1979 set from Norway, with a trio featuring vibraphonist Wolfgang Lackerschmid, highlights the growth and maturity of this troubled but inspiring artist.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/boK0XJnEgYMppYiFY47fBZeA4By.jpg", "actors": ["Chet Baker ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
