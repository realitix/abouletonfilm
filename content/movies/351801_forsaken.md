His faith in god stood fast, and he believed that God can and will heal his daughter. But time could become a man\u2019s worst enemy! As his daughter became Weaker and weaker, she eventually knocked on death\u2019s door. The man\u2019s faith started to fade away and he kept questioning God. The young father eventually broke down and gave up hope. With the bible against the wall in an act of desperation, he called out that there is no god. For the next 30 seconds he felt what it was like without God. It shocked him back to reality as he experienced this cold, silent and lonely time. He eventually came to a point when he realized that if he weighed up eternal life to His earthly circumstances, that choosing God was a given.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sczIGBbVZyUFTfk2lKJ0pUo8Py7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
