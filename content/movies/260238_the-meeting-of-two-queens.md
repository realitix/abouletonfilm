Clipped from their most iconic works, the Chilean born video artist manipulates scenes from the legendary actresses to turn two of the most well known Hollywood starlets in film history into a silent-film style lesbian fantasy. Barriga drives the narrative using common motifs such as the cigarette and the one-eyed glance from beneath a wide brimmed hat, motifs which are familiar to us, but recontextualized within a queer narrative. Major points for including a rainmaker in the soundtrack.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9LRaE2dt7dZBHWmKA1wQSUc9P4j.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
