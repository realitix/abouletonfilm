It looks at the impact of recycled uranium weapons and the far-reaching physical and moral effects on every Australian. The film's release has been timely as the Australian government currently moves to approve more uranium mines while arguing the contrary - that by going nuclear Australia is being both 'safe' and 'green'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7grbYIpUHzuaHqw1bLSsIn9cpX1.jpg", "actors": ["George W.
