The college students have all gone home and Kirsten (Hari Leigh), a blissfully irresponsible register jerk, reigns as the clown princess of the downtown bar scene.

While reluctantly reconnecting with an eccentric childhood friend (Susan Burke) who has recently moved to town, an ill-fated nitrous oxide bender unexpectedly forces Kirsten's first baby steps into adulthood.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qVfzSOBAoO4TrT8pB1hqCMoNOkF.jpg", "actors": ["Hari Leigh (Kirsten)", "Susan Burke (Lynn)", "Amy Seimetz (Katie)", "Josh Fadem (Mike)", "Ann Magnuson (Luann)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
