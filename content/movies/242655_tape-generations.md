The extremely slow paced life of these objects is being revealed within an isolated space where everything starts from a symmetric composition. From this orderly state deviations and differences in behaviour slowly become visible through the force of gravity. Resulting in unpredictable shapes and movements that somehow feel familiar.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1SaKsOfmByLaTG7zbrFtzbRAZZo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
