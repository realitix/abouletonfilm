Then one day, the Toki twins, two ninja sisters he's known since childhood, transfer to his school and issue him a challenge to take back their family dagger from him. Unfortunately for him, they have discovered his one weakness: the fear of the naked female body. Now, Takeshi must undergo special training from his classmates Atsuko and Torai, and his teacher Miss Ayatsugi to resist the combined brute strength of Akari and the temptation of her sex-crazed twin Kagiri. Class will never be in order with these three constantly fighting each other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xNSYuJZD13a5fPsspa6wBEfS3FZ.jpg", "actors": ["Toshihiko Seki (Takeshi Chimatsuri)", "Chika Sakamoto (Akari Toki)", "Kazue Komiya (Miss Ayatsugi)", "Kazuhiko Inoue (Torai)", "Naoko Matsui (Kagiri Toki)", "Yuko Mizutani (Atsuko Yamaguchi)", "Junichi Kanbara (Student B)", "Masako Ebisu (Mrs. Toki)", "Michiko Munakata (Mrs. Chimatsuri)", "Minoru Inaba (Kagemaru Toki)", "Mitsuhiro Kasuga (Grandpa Toki)", "Moriko Eto (Female student)", "Nanaseko Watanabe (Ayako / Takeshi's younger sister)", "Naoko Kida (Granny Toki)", "Nozomu Sasaki (Tamahara)", "Toshinobu Sakurai (Uemura)", "Toshiwaku Wasaki (Naizo Chimatsuri)", "Tsutomu Kashiwakura (Student A)", "Yoko Yano (Atsuko's mother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
