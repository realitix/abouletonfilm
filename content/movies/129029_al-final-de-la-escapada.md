After a lifetime chasing utopias, gave his last bout, worthy of death, with the same revolutionary fervor with which he faced the Franco regime and Central American dictatorships. This is the story of a man who spent fourteen years in Franco's jails, was sentenced to death, tortured and risked his life repeatedly by his dreams of universal social justice.
