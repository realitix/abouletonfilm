Her last challenge is to make a movie on May 68. It's a challenge, not only because she will be forced to face a story that is not hers, but specially because her new boyfriend, Blaise, doesn't understand this idea, even more, he hates people that have participated at this event. Anne Buridan is a methodical person and even a bit obsessive. Nothing and nobody will make her turn away from her project. She starts to meet people that were figures of that period. She will start, evidently, with a woman, Marianne, who speaks amongst others, of Jean-Pierre Lucciani. The name is not unknown to her because it's the same as Blaise's. She will go see him right away. Jean-Pierre is Blaise's father alright. She goes back home and keeps the secret from Blaise. Anne Buridan just lost, without knowing it, control over this situation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b7AWnrU0k1Z0M1P8VkQXMHXiGeu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
