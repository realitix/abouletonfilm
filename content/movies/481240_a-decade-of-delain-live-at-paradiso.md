Often dubbed 'Lightwish' by detractors I personally find them the best of those bands derivative of the Finnish legends.\r\n\r\nMy only real complaints about this show are the use of backing tapes for even guitar parts. You have two guitarists on stage, so what the hell!?! The other is the fact that there are only two songs from the phenomenal second album 'April Rain'.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, this is slick, looks and sounds great and will make fans happy. I just wish they had squeezed in 'Nothing Left' or 'On The Other Side'."}], "recommandations_id": []}
