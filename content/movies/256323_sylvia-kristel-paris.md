Between November 2000 and June 2002 Manon de Boer recorded the stories and memories of Kristel. At each recording session she asked her to speak about a city where Kristel has lived: Paris, Los Angeles, Brussels or Amsterdam; over the two years she spoke on several occasions about the same city. At first glance the collection of stories appears to make up a sort of biography, but over time it shows the impossibility of biography: the impossibility of \u2018plotting\u2019 somebody\u2019s life as a coherent narrative.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bXwLwJX5Uu4DbRkIUB9LL0SaSm4.jpg", "actors": ["Sylvia Kristel (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
