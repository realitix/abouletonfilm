Through a lens of memory and dreams, two girls explore their friendship and the joy of a juicy mandarin in the dry Australian landscape. An evocative montage, the film evokes tactile experiences and revels in the visceral. It's a musing on childhood, kinship, instincts, violence and forgiveness. The children of Mandarin Peel serve as metaphors for Australia itself, its exploration of identity, forging relationships, inventing history and future.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/31o7DhvYCSY90c207hz3JL8Zgaj.jpg", "actors": ["Jamira Hunter (Jamira)", "Minnie Liszukiewicz (Minnie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
