Ko is drafted into the Japanese army and forced to leave his pregnant girlfriend behind. When he is presumably killed in action, Chang becomes a cabaret girl to support their baby. Thanks to director Pan Lei's sensitive scenario, the dramatic outcome is far from predictable.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7G6sPYoe0AdtpmVvGESiQwXQC4W.jpg", "actors": ["Chang Mei-Yao (Ye Su Jin)", "Ko Chun-Hsiung (Lin Tien Si)", "Chu Jing (Juang Yu Lan)", "Ou Wei (Shu Che Shong)", "Chow Siu-Hing (Uncle Ah Fo)", "Liu Wai (Japanese sergeant)", "Pan Chieh-Yi (Su Jin's nanny)", "Chu Hsu-Ching (Che Shong's sister)", "Ku Kwan (Mr. Ye)", "Han Chiang (Tien Si's father)", "Law Hon (Lin Tien Si's classmate)", "An Ping (Lin Tien Si's classmate)", "Wang Sun (Client)", "Chiu Keung (Client)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
