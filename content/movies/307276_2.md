A \"dissection of the male psyche\", the production commanded a large of amount of Greek press attention, not least for its open references to homosexuality. 2 proved a commercial success; its run was extended twice and over 100,000 tickets were sold in total. The work seems to draw upon a range of influences, including the work of Jean Genet, Rene Magritte and Robert Wilson. Inspiration for the show also came partly from Papaioannou's experiences as a gay man in Greece. Contemporary magazine described 2 as an \"inspiring\" work that \"captures the zeitgeist\".", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Altin Huta ()", "Giorgos Kopsidas ()", "Euripides Laskaridis ()", "Drosos Skotis ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "EntYUdDMcRQ"}
