Nearly 100 Danes are presented in the film, amongst them a racing cyclist, a Minister of Finance, a popular actor and 13 unmarried women from a provincial town. \"There is too much fogginess and rain and melancholy in most of the pictures of Denmark,\" says J\u00f8rgen Leth. \"But not in my film. I would like to show you some authentic, clear and beautiful pictures from this strange country.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kUxbuRBt8CWH4lkHU2MbZDMR6qG.jpg", "actors": ["Asger Leth (Himself)", "J\u00f8rgen Ryg ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
