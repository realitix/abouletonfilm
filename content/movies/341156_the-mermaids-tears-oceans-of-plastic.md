A 'plastic soup' of waste, killing hundreds of thousands of animals every year and leaching chemicals slowly up the food chain. In Holland, scientists found plastic in the stomachs of 95% of all fulmar birds. In Germany, plastic has been found to affect the reproductive systems of animals, while in the US, conservationists are seeing increasing numbers of dolphins die in agony, their guts blocked with rubbish. What will be the long term impact of this 'plastic pollution'? Can anything be done to clean up our oceans?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lEWuDAQ4QqVf5NulBRURO1Vbirm.jpg", "actors": ["Christiana Boerger (Herself)", "Gwendolyn Lattin (Herself)", "Habib Kharrat (Himself)", "Marcus Eriksen (Himself)", "Fran\u00e7ois Galgani (Himself)", "Anna Cummins (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "8l01ITT3jfA"}
