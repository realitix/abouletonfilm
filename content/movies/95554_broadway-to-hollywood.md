Frank Morgan and Alice Brady play vaudeville headliners of the 1880s whose fame is eclipsed by their son (played as a youth by Jackie Cooper, then as an adult by Russell Hardie). Morgan and Brady are reduced to bit roles in a musical starring their son and his wife (Madge Evans). Alas, Sonny spoils it all by drinking and philandering, while his wife dies in a freak accident.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p0g6m01EOkAQI81YEckiXK2Hjh9.jpg", "actors": ["Alice Brady (Lulu Hackett)", "Frank Morgan (Ted Hackett)", "Jackie Cooper (Ted Hackett Jr. as Child)", "Russell Hardie (Ted Hackett Jr.)", "Madge Evans (Anne Ainsley)", "Mickey Rooney (Ted Hackett III as Child)", "Eddie Quillan (Ted Hackett III)", "Jimmy Durante (Jimmy)", "May Robson (Veteran Actress)", "Fay Templeton (Production Number Singer - Edited from The March of Time (1930) (archive footage))", "Albertina Rasch Dancers (Themselves - Edited from The March of Time (1930) (archive footage))", "Tad Alexander (Cousin David)", "Edward Brophy (Joe Mannion)", "Ruth Channing (Wanda)", "William Collier Sr. (Vaudeville Act (archive footage))", "Marie Dressler (Vaudeville Act (archive footage))", "Claire Du Brey (Aunt Clara)", "Nelson Eddy (John Sylvester)", "Muriel Evans (Maid)", "Barney Fagan (Vaudeville Act (archive footage))", "Lew Fields (In Horse Costume)", "Eddie Foster (Undetermined Role)", "Robert Greig ('Diamond Jim' Brady)", "Sherry Hall (Assistant on Film Set)", "Tenen Holtz (Booking Agent)", "DeWolf Hopper Sr. (Vaudeville Act (archive footage))", "Curly Howard (Fritz the Clown)", "Jean Howard (Grace - Chorus Girl)", "Moe Howard (Otto the Clown)", "Frank Jenks (Call Boy)", "Isabelle Keith (Jenny Carter - Girl in Movie Clip)", "Louis Mann (Vaudeville Act (archive footage))", "Miriam Marlin (Chorine)", "Edwin Maxwell (Rockwell)", "Una Merkel (Flirt in Audience)", "Tom Nawn and Company (Performers)", "Helen Parrish (Cousin)", "Edward Peil Sr. (Stage Manager)", "Albertina Rasch (Dance Group Leader (archive footage))", "Rice and Cady (Performers)", "Josephine Sable (Vaudeville Act (archive footage))", "Bobby Somers (Ted Hackett III as a Baby)", "Billy Sullivan (Undetermined Role)", "Forrest Taylor (Conway - Film Director)", "Joe Weber (In Horse Costume)", "Leo White (Joe Weber)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
