Some were deemed hopeless cases, never to be part of society again. These were the patients and residents of New Zealand's 'Bins', the huge psychiatric hospitals that dotted the country up until the 90s. 'Mental Notes' tracks the intersecting stories of five remarkable New Zealanders. Their marginalised experiences form the backbone of a social history that many still feel uncomfortable to acknowledge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dJdMDzZMk3DaeEehUeYADdQoXR9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
