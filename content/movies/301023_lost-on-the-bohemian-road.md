LOST ON THE BOHEMIAN ROAD realistically portrays a 90's generation that is in search of more than traditional, comfortable answers of yesterday. If one has ever felt the alienation of a changing society or the growing pains of innocence lost in a time of reckless experience, it's time to hit the bohemian road.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nUpC8CFlebxlwOhdCgS88O6IMgz.jpg", "actors": ["Eric Zudak ()", "Kate Peckham ()", "Terri Heffron ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
