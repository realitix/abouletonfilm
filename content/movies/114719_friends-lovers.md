(Ian and dad are estranged because dad worked too many hours when Ian was a lad.) Dad has something to say, but Ian won't listen. Meanwhile, David is gay and virginal; Ian's business partner, Keaton, is unhappy that his sister Jane is pregnant with no plans to tell the father; Lisa is everybody's pal and no one's lover; John, stuck in adolescence, is always on the make. He brings German-born stunner, Carla, and promptly loses her affection to Hans, a fast-talking ski instructor. David meets Manny: they have chess in common. Soon, surprises abound as relationships take new turns.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5zh1PQPN7dl8BX2zdaEYyiNRNXp.jpg", "actors": ["Danny Nucci (David)", "Stephen Baldwin (Jon)", "George Newbern (Ian Wickham)", "Neill Barry (Keaton McCarthy)", "Robert Downey Jr. (Hans)", "Ivo Lopez (Motel Clerk)", "David Rasche (Richard 'Richie' Wickham)", "Josi K.
