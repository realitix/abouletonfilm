It's incredible to note that there is no CGI here, this is pure raw stunt work, the film plays out as a standard good versus evil tale, but it's the realisation of the crash bang wallop sequences that lift it to being one of the most important sci-fi action movies of modern times.\r\n\r\nThe baddies are a seething mass of leather, masks, and mohawks, they scowl as they rape pillage and plunder anything in their path, they will stop at nothing to get the craved gasoline that is so important in this world. The good guys are joined by the road warrior himself, Mad Max Rockatansky, a former police officer who turned to being the angry lone warrior of the road after his wife and child were murdered. Can these honest folk survive the onslaught of the crazed plunderers?\r\n\r\nWell it's high octane entertainment finding out, and the pace is relentless. The direction is first rate, the scenes are put together brilliantly, and the sound is incredible for those with home cinema. Whilst the film may be guilty of having little to no dialogue for the most part, it really isn't needed as it's all in the action, so strap yourself in and enjoy the ride.\r\n\r\nBrilliant film that is still a benchmark for the genre. 9/10"}], "recommandations_id": [9659, 9355, 1103, 9387], "youtube_key": "UR4mhks--Do"}
