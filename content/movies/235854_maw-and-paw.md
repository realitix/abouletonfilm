Maw and Paw and their kids live on a farm and can be described as a rural family with below average intelligence (their pet pig, Milford, is regarded in the opening titles as the \"Smart One\"). At dinner, Milford answers a phone-in quiz contest correctly and wins a new car for the family. The problem is no one in the family knows how to drive it (Maw thinks the antenna is a \"new fangled clothesline\").", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9oEHwo3WifZt1IQfRKoaxOslkPz.jpg", "actors": ["Dal McKennon (Paw (voice) (uncredited))", "Grace Stafford (Maw (voice) (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
