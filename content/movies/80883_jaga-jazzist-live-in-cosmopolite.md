This recording was made around the same time as the release of Jaga's What We Must, and features material from throughout their career, all replicated with remarkable levels of precision on the live stage. In addition to the excellent 80-minute concert the DVD comes with bonus features that include each and every music video the band has ever made. 'Synchronize Yr Watches' is the most notable inclusion, having never been released either as a video or an audio track before. Also thrown in to the bargain is a 15-minute interview with the band that's been subtitled for all us non-Norwegian speakers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uAhSq7wAU1Ssk8S7G0uIgA2n66t.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
