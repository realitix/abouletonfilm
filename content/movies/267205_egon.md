His stylised portraits come to live and edge him further towards death. Choreographer Stuart has transformed his images into a transparent movement language that by turns follows and ignores the music by Alexander von Zemlinsky. The rawly expressive and confrontational imagery reflects the powerful effect of Schiele\u2019s drawings and paintings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eFvljkPwRazUGEOErg1qnAtpguh.jpg", "actors": ["Gloria Benedikt (Edith Schiele)", "Youri Jongenelen (Egon Schiele)", "Susanne Middelberg (Model 3)", "Noortje van Gestel (Model 2)", "Loet van Jaarsveld (Baby)", "Jorijn Vriesendorp (Model 1)", "Richel Wieles (Death)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "xe_4t_Ud1ZU"}
