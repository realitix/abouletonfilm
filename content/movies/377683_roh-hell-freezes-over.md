It took place on January 14, 2006 at the Pennsylvania National Guard Armory in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The show\u2019s name comes from the main event, as ROH World Champion Bryan Danielson takes on Combat Zone Wrestling\u2019s Chris Hero. The match came about after Danielson and Hero made several comments about each other on the internet. Danielson then sent an open contract for a shot at the ROH World Championship to CZW, who then signed Hero. Earlier in the day, CZW held An Afternoon of Main Events at the New Alhambra Arena in Philadelphia. During the show, Bryan Danielson, ROH Pure Champion Nigel McGuinness, and ROH Tag Team Champions Austin Aries and Roderick Strong jumped the guard rail, starting a fight with several CZW wrestlers.  The show would be the start of the Ring of Honor vs. Combat Zone Wrestling feud, which would last for seven months.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jr4eJ4QkTOQJXemnlDnaKu3vFbV.jpg", "actors": ["Bryan Danielson ()", "Chris Spradlin (Chris Hero)", "Allen Neal Jones ()", "Matthew Korklan (Matt Sydal)", "Nuufolau Joel Seanoa ()", "Benjamin Whitmer (BJ Whitmer)", "Jack Evans ()", "Adam Pearce ()", "Allen Ferreira (Jason Blade)", "Sarath Ton (Kid Mikaze)", "Sal Rinauro ()", "Trik Davis ()", "Daniel Christopher Covell ()", "Jamar Shipman (Jay Lethal)", "Nelson Rodriguez Erazo (Homicide)", "Chris Lindsey (Roderick Strong)", "Patrick Martin (Alex Shelley)", "James Guffey (Jimmy Rave)", "Prince Nana Osei Bandoh (Prince Nana)", "Federico Palacios (Azrieal)", "Claudio Castagnoli ()", "Scott Colton (Colt Cabana)", "Steven Haworth (Nigel McGuinness)", "Tony Mamaluke ()", "Daniel Healy Solwold Jr. ()", "Rick Diaz (Ricky Reyes)", "Bryan Danielson (Himself)", "Allen Neal Jones (Himself)", "Nuufolau Joel Seanoa (Himself)", "Jack Evans (Himself)", "Adam Pearce (Himself)", "Sal Rinauro (Himself)", "Trik Davis (Himself)", "Daniel Christopher Covell (Himself)", "Claudio Castagnoli (Himself)", "Tony Mamaluke (Himself)", "Daniel Healy Solwold Jr. (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
