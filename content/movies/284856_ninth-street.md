In 1968, the area has diminished to strip clubs and juke joints inhabited by Vietnam War draftees that pass through from nearby Fort Riley. Heads of the group include a wino who lost a leg in WWII, a taxi dispatcher, a saloon owner, and a crazed bag lady. The younger generation is represented by a young prostitute who is trying to get off the streets, but is forced to continue to work by a no-good boy friend and the need to feed her baby. Martin Sheen also appears as a white minister who prefers the people in the area over his own congregation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wxBzQCrOPbT0mvMrRofrKSsM8PQ.jpg", "actors": ["Don Washington (Bebo)", "Kevin Willmott (Huddie)", "Nadine Griffith (Carrie Mae)", "Byron Myrick (Love)", "Isaac Hayes (TippyToe)", "Queen Bey (Mama Butler)", "Kaycee Moore (Pop-Bottle Ruby)", "Martin Sheen (Father Frank)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
