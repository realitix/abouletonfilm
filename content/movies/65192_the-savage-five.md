The always great David Chiang plays a lesser version of his Rover character from \"Duel Of The Iron Fist\", and Ti Lung, looking incredible here, is at his physical best. Accolades to Chen Kuan Tai and Wang Chung in great sympathetic roles, too. A kung fu classic where the actual martial arts display takes a back seat to the mesmerizing story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bTYYdxPoYxyQueO2f86hiN3mnjc.jpg", "actors": ["David Chiang (Chen Teng)", "Ti Lung (Fang Yi-fei)", "Chen Kuan-Tai (Ma Tao)", "Danny Lee Sau-Yin (Wei Ming-hui (as Li Hsiu Hsien))", "Wong Chung (Yao Kuang)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [88633, 64360, 105482, 73652], "youtube_key": "tZ8U5k9-P1c"}
