THE LOOM might be compared to musical quartet-form (as there are almost always four superimposed pictures); but the complexity of texture, multiplicity of tone, and the variety of interrelated rhythm, suggest symphonic dimensions. The film is very inspired by George Melies: the animals exist (in Jane's enclosure) as on a stage, their interrelationships edited to the disciplines of dance, so therefore one might say this hardly represents \"animal life on earth\"; but I would argue that this work at least epitomizes theatrical Nature, magical Creature, and is the outside limit, to date, of my art in that respect. (The balance-of-light was so perfectly realized in making the neg. of this print that I wish to credit Western Cine Lab's \"timer\" Louise Fujiki as creative collaborator in the accomplishment of this work.)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u3F1cOQBHgmrgXT3aysQj1yWt3t.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
