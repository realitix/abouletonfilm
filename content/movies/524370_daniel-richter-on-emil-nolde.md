A debate, that mirrors the moralism and bigottery of a generation that seems to think, that the world is a moral playground.\u201d Emil Nolde\u2019s relationship to the Nazi-regime in the Third Reich has given rise to immense discussions within the last months. For decades the broader public had a picture of Nolde being one of the \u201centartete\u201d artists as well as being prohibited painting by the Nazi-regime. Though this on the surface is true, it was the result of a great disappointment to Nolde. For years, he had strived to become \u201cthe\u201d artist of the Thrid Reich, praising his own art as true, German, anti-French and anti-Jewish. Possible competitors within the German art world like Max Pechstein he actively denounced to the Nazi authorities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t2FBGZWZgUEVPNkqi0rLYOGMKhV.jpg", "actors": ["Daniel Richter (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
