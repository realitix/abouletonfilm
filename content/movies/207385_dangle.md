It\u2019s one of those kitsch ones, with an exaggerated amount of frills, and it appears to have extraordinary magical powers. Pull and it\u2019s night. Pull once more and it\u2019s day again. Marvellous, but would you be cautious as not to destroy the biorhythm of everybody on earth? Or would you decide to have some major fun?
