Eighteen songs, performed in December 2009 at the Hammersmith Apollo, with an absolute minimum of onstage chatter and dollops of stylishly grainy, MTV-like filler: Ms. Spektor on the plane from New York, driving through London, applying makeup before the show. It\u2019s perfectly tasteful, a fine showcase for her music and, more important, a fine promotional tool for the accompanying CD and DVD (which \u2014 surprise \u2014 contain four additional songs).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jvkikF7KqYiuFrhnJlqzC4URHyf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
