Struggling to get by in their rustic homestead, he had at least wanted to give his family a special Christmas. But with a blizzard blowing in and the train bearing their gifts nowhere in sight, it seems Christmas is just one more thing they\u2019ll have to do without. But as dusk falls, the Jeppsons\u2019 packages unexpectedly arrive at the post office in the not-so-nearby town. Half-blind Postman George Schow is hesitant to brave the storm, but his son, Sidney, will stop at nothing to bring Christmas to the Jeppsons\u2014and ask their daughter, Ellen, to the New Year\u2019s Eve dance. Now it\u2019s up to father and son to battle fierce elements in an attempt to deliver a Christmas miracle. Don\u2019t miss this heartwarming reminder that while God helps those who help themselves, sometimes He does so through others.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iJaXnb2A2nPI1s0knBxqeFxHEhi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
