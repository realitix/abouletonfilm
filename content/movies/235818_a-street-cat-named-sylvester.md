Tweety seeks shelter from a blizzard and taps on Granny's house door. Sylvester answers and grabs the canary. He tries to hide Tweety from Granny while evading the attacks of Hector, Granny's bed-ridden bulldog, who wants revenge on Sylvester for his broken leg. Tweety keeps escaping Sylvester's clutches, with Hector's help.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f8eonIp5VN7mzB9LyOAtlljYQvn.jpg", "actors": ["Mel Blanc (Sylvester / Tweety / Hector Bulldog (voice))", "Bea Benaderet (Granny (voice) (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [219507], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
