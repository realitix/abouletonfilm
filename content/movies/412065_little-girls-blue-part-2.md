The girls quickly work their way through the team of counselors. The sex is sleazy, free, fast and loose - and brings back a time when the only people who even thought of using condoms were those whose girls weren't on the pill. Featuring the seldom-seen but fabulous Barbara Klouds - this is far and wide agreed to be some of her best work indeed.  (The movie credits Joanna Williams as Writer and Director, but that is a sobriquet for Maria Lease.)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jTKfBJ8vS0nD8NXhqRzcToIblmo.jpg", "actors": ["Lori Blue (Marium Kester)", "Elaine Wells (Buffy)", "Kathleen Kristel (Tawny)", "Shirly Duke (Sandy)", "Carl Lincoln (Buck)", "Kevin James (Roger Dwarsky)", "Bill Buck (Fleming Larson)", "Herschel Savage (Vance Carlson)", "Dusty Dreams (Student Body)", "Frank Buffdurm (Student Body)", "Lisa Waller (Student Body)", "Linda Filler (Student Body)", "Maggie Sinclair (Student Body)", "Trisha Ingle (Student Body)", "Michael James (Student Body)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
