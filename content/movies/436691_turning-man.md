Despite being in motion, the figure seems frozen, almost automated. The little man turns, turns and turns again, in an abstract setting that turns out to be a vinyl record on a turntable in a domestic interior. The beat of the music is reflected and embodied by the continual rotation of the character.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gFfXdQO0oBQJkbaUonPsoaBZwOE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
