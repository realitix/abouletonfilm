And there are no known faces at least in the lead roles. With a lesser known star cast and a new theme, actor Abhishek manages to render a thriller in his maiden directorial venture that is interesting to watch.  The 'Mogamul' man, who later established himself as a successful small screen actor, deserves a pat on the back for coming out with a script without clichs. However, one could not avoid the impression that the film could have been better had he infused more pace in it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fXX8FEewTE04zEU7er4OonrsPG3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
