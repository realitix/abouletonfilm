During this time he has seen the area undergo a dramatic transformation, including the demolition of six of it's seven tower blocks. Ron's ambition is to create a 'world class' collection of music for his talented students to play and write lyrics for. This music will challenge the negative views many still hold of the area - views that have the potential to hold his students back, and undermine the aims of the Ballymun Music Programme.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5gugT9YROf35H1u8EzkFrAE6V1L.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
