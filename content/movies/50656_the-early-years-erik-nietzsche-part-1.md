In the late 1970s, Erik is accepted by the Danish National Film School where he enters a world of angry and unhelpful tutors, weird fellow students and unwritten rules. In this both exhilarating and angst-provoking period for him, Erik feels increasingly like a foreigner in the film industry. Frequently, he is merely an observer of the absurdities that surround him. He encounters trade union disputes, falls in love and experiences self-assured empowered women who refuse to make a commitment. The film is a drama full of comedy - a sharp portrait of a conceited but entertaining world of film which we suspect our dogged young director will eventually conquer with his vision.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qEAJsiBVMPQc2INIYrgmah4rlk.jpg", "actors": ["Jonatan Spang (Erik Nietzsche)", "Lars von Trier (Narrator)", "Mille Lehfeldt (Margrethe (as Mille Hoffmeyer Lehfeldt))", "David Dencik (Zelko)", "Carl Martin Nor\u00e9n (G\u00f6ran)", "Therese Damsgaard (Karin)", "S\u00f8ren Pilmark (Mads)", "Bodil J\u00f8rgensen (Katrine Bonfils)", "Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Sammy)", "Paprika Steen (Ursula \u00d8stdal)", "Ditte Hansen (Filosofil\u00e6rer)", "Troels Lyby (Bent)", "Jens Albinus (Troels H\u00f8jbjerg)", "Christian Fuhlendorff (Lille Fotograf)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [59190, 14173], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
