The sessions and locations were influenced by gangs, Hollywood, and Los Angeles culture. It wasn\u2019t much of a stretch because skate crews can be very gang-like to begin with. The Deathwish dudes are a tight-knit crew. Overall, I don\u2019t think this is too far from what these guys are actually like. It\u2019s really close to the truth. You wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you saw Jon Dickson on the beach asleep in the morning.\u2014Skin Phillips", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9aoZ7XnxkfOfkhguGxM8810UmLO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
