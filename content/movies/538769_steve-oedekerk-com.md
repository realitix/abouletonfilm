The \"premise\" is that a young boy is watching the show on a strange CD that his mom bought. Sketches include \"Glass Booth Guy\" in which a gas station clerk mocks people from his bullet-proof glass box and a sketch in which a woman is trying to break up with her weird boyfriend (he's a skeleton). The undisputed highlight is \"OEDEBATTLE\", a parody of Mortal Kombat-style games. In it, the young boy tries to defeat Steve's muscle-bound character; unfortunately, the characters he gets to choose from are \"Accountant,\" \"Sick Old Woman,\" \"Little Girl,\" \"Puppy\" and \"HerbaPet.\"\r \u2014Michael \"Rabbit\" Hutchison", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9pS5WejgrQzdoVPlV45lWneklWf.jpg", "actors": ["Steve Oedekerk ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
