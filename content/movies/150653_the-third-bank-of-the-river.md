Openly embracing a mode of magical realism, dos Santos' celebrated film tells the story of a farming family defined by the absence of its father who abruptly abandoned his wife and children, sailing away down the river, including his son who continues to communicate with his father, speaking daily to him from the river bank. While offering an evocative vision of rural Brazil as a timeless land of mystery and solemnity, The Third Bank of the River is also bitingly satiric in the remarkable depiction of religious belief when the family moves to the city and its youngest member, a mesmerizing little girl, is revealed to be a kind of saint, capable of miraculous acts.  -Harvard Film Archive", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7lAuWzIRe779OxfQB4Q7viURmaP.jpg", "actors": ["Ilya S\u00e3o Paulo ()", "Maria Ribeiro ()", "Vanja Orico ()", "Jofre Soares ()", "Renato Matos ()", "Affonso Brazza ()", "Gilson Moura ()", "Andrade Jr. ()", "Ana Maria Nascimento e Silva ()", "Sonjia Saurin ()", "Barbara Brant ()", "Mariane Vicentini ()", "Chico Diaz ()", "Waldir Onofre ()", "Laura Lustosa ()", "Henrique Rovira ()", "Mario Lute ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
