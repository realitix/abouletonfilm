The two descend to Earth, and find out that the book is in the possession of a man named Suraj, who is unwilling to give up the book as he has read the prophecy about his mother's dying. This refusal is catastrophic as Yamraj cannot plan anyone's death, and no one will be permitted to die unless and until the book comes in his possession. At the same time there is an evil man named Chota Ravan who is trying to possess the book in order to spread his control over Bombay.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s0Xi4dPTh1XwUlrcrhOXvHs8n8a.jpg", "actors": ["Venkatesh (Suraj)", "Raveena Tandon (Lilly)", "Asrani (Chitragupt)", "Laxmikant Berde (Pandu)", "Satyendra Kapoor (Gopal Kaka)", "Dinesh Hingoo (Editor)", "Rakesh Pandey (Suraj's Dad)", "Reema Lagoo (Suraj's Mother)", "Tisca Chopra (Lata)", "Shashi Kiran (Bavan)", "Ghanshyam Rohera (Waiter)", "Chitti Babu ()", "Jenny ()", "Tiku Talsania (Jeweller)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [25505, 16566], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
