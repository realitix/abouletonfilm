Carpenter)(Vane Calvert) of Smokey Smith (Bob Steele) are murdered while traveling with a wagon train that is attacked by outlaws. Smokey swears revenge but his only possible chance lies in finding the member of the border-gang who took a ring from his father's finger. The sheriff (Earl Dwire) of a nearby border town makes Smokey a deputy after the latter saves his life when outlaws attack a stagecoach the sheriff is escorting. This enables Smokey to find the hideout of the gang that killed his parents, and he, posing as a wanted man, is able to join the gang. He soon incurs the wrath of gang-member Kent(Warner Richmond), who is jealous over the attention that Bess Bart (Mary Kornman, step-daughter of the gang-leader, \"Blaze\" Bart (George 'Gabby' Hayes), is showing Smokey.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hvAGZTP9KYThvgtwDPZEOn4dDf8.jpg", "actors": ["Bob Steele (Smokey Smith)", "Mary Kornman (Bess Bart)", "George 'Gabby' Hayes (Blaze Bart)", "Warner Richmond (Kent)", "Earl Dwire (Sheriff)", "Horace B.
