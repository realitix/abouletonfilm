South-of-the-Border matinee idol Carlos Thompson stars as an idealistic intern, doing his best to survive a very tough day on the job. When not scurrying from one patient to another, the intern tries to maintain equilibrium in his romance with a nurse (Elisa Galve). Comedy dovetails neatly into tragedy, which in turn segues smoothly into heart-tugging pathos. A box-office smash in Argentina, Sala de Guardia repeated its moneymaking performance all throughout Latin America.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kK2C3tEGPRGDZBqOYgSEYm2XwBX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
