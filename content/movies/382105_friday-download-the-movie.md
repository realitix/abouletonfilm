That's certainly what Bobby, Shannon, and the gang thought when they set off on an adventure of a lifetime. But when their truck breaks down in the middle of night, in the middle of nowhere without phone signal, they have no option to but to seek refuge in a creepy old mansion. Welcomed to spend the night by the brother and sister who live alone in the old house - very strange things begin to occur! As the local cops don't seem to want to help and are equally as odd as the gang's brother and sister hosts - the five friends have to keep their wits and sanity about them and hatch an ingenious plan, as the road-trip adventure rapidly turns into whirlwind of spooks and crazy mysterious goings-on.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/okkHpIXQMSIHgUWmUexpZmy86gd.jpg", "actors": ["Bobby Lockwood (Bobby)", "Tyger Drew-Honey (Caleb)", "Dionne Bromfield (Dionne)", "Louisa Connolly-Burnham (Clara)", "Shannon Flynn (Shannon)", "George Sear (George)", "Richard Wisker (Richard)", "Ethan Lawrence (Fraser)", "Nathan Bryon (Darren)", "Connor Ball (Himself)", "Angus Barnett (Gene Peck)", "Bars & Melody (Themselves)", "Marc Blaidd (Geek 3)", "Marcus Brigstocke (Himself)", "Isabelle Estelle Corbusier ()", "Kevin Eldon (Mr. Prim)", "Tristan Evans (Himself)", "Luke Langsdale (Uncle Pete)", "Gavin Lee Lewis (Geek)", "James McVey (Himself)", "David Mitchell (Policeman)", "Craig Osborne (Demolition Man)", "Bradley Simpson (Himself)", "The Vamps (Themselves)", "Richard Burman (Geek 2)", "Kenny England (BBC Radio 1 Camera Man)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
