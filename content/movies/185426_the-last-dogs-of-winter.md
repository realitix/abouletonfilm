Brian Ladoon is an eccentric, lone-wolf Canadian who has dedicated his life to saving the extinction-threatened Qimmiq - a species of canine used by local Inuits for centuries as hunting-hounds but now abandoned in favour of motorised skidoos.  The snowy wilds of remote northern Manitoba make for a stirringly picturesque backdrop for footage of the rugged but irresistibly cute Qimmiq, not to mention the polar bears who occasionally amble by. Doing their best to make an impact among such furry scene stealers are the crustily ornery Ladoon and his unflappably laid-back younger Kiwi assistant, former teen-TV pinup Caleb Ross.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4cctvnOGQmg8SVXXmVtxt1KdbG0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
