Meant to be a reserve unit as it was made of the young, 16-17 year old sons of Aizu samurai. Their story is one of the great tragedies of the Boshin War (1868-1869) as they were called into action. Getting cut off from the main body of their platoon, a group of 20 from the 2nd squad retreated to Iimori Hill, where they looked down upon fires surrounding Aizu Castle and thinking that the castle has fallen and all is lost, they choose to die as samurai by committing seppuku. A superb rendition of this true story that shows the true honor of the samurai.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ifkqBjVqcez0LTrWON8RaabavVk.jpg", "actors": ["Raiz\u014d Ichikawa ()", "Ry\u00fb Takeda ()", "Takeshi Hanayagi ()", "Takashi Mita ()", "Shintar\u014d Katsu ()", "Yataro Kurokawa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
