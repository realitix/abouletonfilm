Through the central testimony of Miguel \u00c1ngel Hurtado, victim who has kept his case in silence for 18 years and who currently works as an activist, this series gives the voice to victims, religious, researchers and also to a pedophile to understand the complexity and the scope of this authentic social scourge that involves thousands of victims and abusers. The final revelation of Miguel \u00c1ngel will shake one of the great pillars of Spanish Catholicism.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tpIxpFlcLT0WgZKc54bt6wVcNQn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
