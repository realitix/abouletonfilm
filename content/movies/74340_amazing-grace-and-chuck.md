He protests the existence of nuclear weapons by refusing to play baseball, which results in the forfeit of a Little League game by his team. \"Amazing Grace\" Smith, a fictional Boston Celtics player, played by NBA star Alex English, decides to join the boy in his protest by resigning from professional basketball. This gives it nationwide coverage, inspiring more pro athletes to join the protest against nuclear weapons. The film reaches a climax when the President of the United States personally meets with Chuck, admiring his resolve but at the same time explaining the practical difficulties of disarmament. Sinister forces, meanwhile, threaten the lives of Amazing Grace and his agent, Lynn.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uEp2ZuH22RN4uPXRX6Y40XCcqWF.jpg", "actors": ["Joshua Zuehlke (Chuck Murdock)", "Alex English (Amazing Grace Smith)", "Jamie Lee Curtis (Lynn Taylor)", "William Petersen (Russell (as William L.
