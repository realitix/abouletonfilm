The DVD is set up as two concerts: the first in 1985 at the Dynamo club, and the second from 1997 at the Dynamo open air festival, both in Eindhoven, Holland.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1EyqInoODd5HHDPdEKXkUMIKvhm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
