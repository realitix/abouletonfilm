Behind-the-scenes, rehearsal and performance footage are interwoven with compelling personal interviews from the cast, dealing with family, inner conflicts, discrimination, coming out, surgery, hormones and the complexities of sexual identity and orientation. By sharing their own journeys, the actors transcend transgender by speaking to issues, such as relationships, careers and spirituality. 'In Full Bloom... transcending gender,' challenges the viewer to move past stereotypes and to see the commonalities we all share as human beings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gFFt5ydWFqLNVu5j4Ywn9cxHwDS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
