A former militant woman who now devotes her time to feminine soccer; a young woman who is active so no girl has to go through what she went through and a lesbian mother who recounts how hostile the laws are regarding the rights of lesbian women. In spite of the difficulties their characters go through, the stories have a lot of humour, some soccer and a tour of the city.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/383QCahyBgLJy0sVc58dbwDfLoZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
