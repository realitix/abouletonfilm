Among his interviewees are: award-winning Taiwanese filmmaker Hou Hsiao-hsien; Hong Kong director Alfred Cheung, a witness to the massacre; actress Deanne Ip, whose national consciousness is fired by the event; as well as his own brothers, one who soon migrates from Hong Kong, and the other, already an Australian emigre. Their personal testimonies are pieced together into a mural of the Chinese people united in their horror and outrage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rj13um1ZUo3K5yUB8shNfINOkHE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
