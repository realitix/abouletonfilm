He raises his eight-year old adopted son, Ton-Ton, and supports his lover Rex by doing his neighbors' laundry, delivering fresh clean clothes to his neighbors despite being visually impaired. As long as he can take care of both of Ton-ton and Rex, Kiko is happy. But things go awry when Rex figures in a drug mess, is hunted by a local syndicate, and runs away with all the money Kiko has - leaving him with nary a dime and void of dignity and pride. Realizing that there is more than just water in the well, a quick pause is all that Kiko needs to muster enough strength and face a new chapter in his life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dtaaGQLHWww0nU6vRKlCZLZ4T6q.jpg", "actors": ["Domineek Almoete (Kiko)", "Neil Suarez (Rex)", "Earl Andrew Figueroa (Tonton)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
