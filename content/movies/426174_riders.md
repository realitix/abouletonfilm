But Rupert has a rival - the brooding gypsy Jake Lovell, whose loathing for the Pin Up of Penscombe has driven him to the top of the riding world to match Rupert's skills. A bitter feud festers between the two stars, who have fought and fornicated their way round the show rings of the world, and now come to a showdown at the Lod Angeles Olympics. As rivals in love and sport, the stage is set for what becomes a compulsive blend of sex, romance, and adventure.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gLUqr6urffcv2DePL1FjbY84vDy.jpg", "actors": ["Marcus Gilbert (Rupert Campell-Black)", "Michael Praed (Jake Lovell)", "Arabella Holzbog (Helen Macaulay / Campbell-Black)", "Caroline Harker (Tory Lovell)", "Anthony Calf (Billy Lloyd-Foxe)", "Belinda Mayne (Lavina Greenslade)", "Sienna Guillory (Fenella Maxwell)", "Brenda Bruce (Granny Maxwell)", "John Standing (Malise Gordon)", "Timothy Morand (Humpty Hamilton)", "Stephanie Beacham (Molly Carter)", "Anthony Valentine (Colonel Carter)", "Andrew Hall (Nigel)", "C\u00e9cile Paoli (Laura Duparru)", "Serena Gordon (Janey Henderson)", "Ian Hogg (Dudley Drabble)", "Philip Anthony (Barman)", "Max Applin (Isa Lovell)", "Gabrielle Beaumont (Lady Roxborough)", "Aran Bell (Ian the Vet)", "Irma Bullough (Maternity Doctor)", "Kay Callard (Nanny Campbell-Black)", "Bruce Cameron (Maitre D)", "Deborah Cornelius (Melanie)", "Tim de Jongh (Pierre)", "Tim de Jongh (Physiotherapist)", "Annabel Giles (Grania Pringle)", "Jean-Pierre Granet (Georges Duparru)", "Corin Greenhow (Show Jumper)", "Cate Hamer (Nurse)", "Barrie Hesketh (Surgeon)", "Gareth Hunt (Commentator (voice))", "Steve Mara (South American Man)", "Nicholas Mead (French Announcer)", "David Neville (Dr. Martin March)", "Annabel Perks (Sarah)", "Ian Ratcliffe (Actor)", "Honor Shepherd (Helen's Landlady)", "Alexander Torriglia (Guy de la Tour)", "Jane van Hool (Marion)", "William G.
