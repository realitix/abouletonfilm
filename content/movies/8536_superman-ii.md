(Perhaps if I had a ladder)\r\n\r\nBut anyway, these three criminals are inadvertently released from the Phantom Zone by Superman and they naturally head toward Earth seeking revenge on the son of their jailer.\r\n\r\nHackman receives top billing this time now that Brando collected his pay cheque and was at the bank cashing it.\r\nA very entertaining and funny sequel thanks to Richard Lester's expert hand at comedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Potential Kermode"}], "recommandations_id": [9531, 1924, 11411, 1452]}
