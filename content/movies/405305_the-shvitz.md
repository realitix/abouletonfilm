The film uses the baths to give a perspective on the evolution of city life, while bringing up issues of ethnicity, nostalgia, sexuality, spirituality and ritual. \"When we sit in this intense heat\", says one patron, \"we're all the same - millionaire and pauper\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w3OUPzoLh1WUiDt7MRhrf9pSq6l.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
