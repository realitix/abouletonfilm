Opening the film on death row where the handsome youth awaits the chair, a stirring test of the legal system evolves after two elite types conspire to expose its inadequacies. Elite, jaded society lawyer Gordon Harrington fabricates a murder, implicating an entirely \"hired\" fall-guy, one Dan O'Connor, while the bored playboy-type hides away on a yacht until the points are proven and the legal system has been disgraced. Naturally, something goes wrong, the playboy really turns up murdered, and O'Connor is now the accused, imprisoned murderer scheduled to be hanged.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hxHolVp1EE4ePRR2Oq5n3wdb9S7.jpg", "actors": ["Clara Bow (Delia Tate)", "George Hackathorne (Dan OConnor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
