The name \"Jordan\" was chosen by the father in honor of the heroine of the novel \"The Great Gatsby\", so it seems that Joe came off the pages of Fitzgerald ... After leaving her native New York 6 years ago, she immigrated to Russia. Now Jordan lives in Moscow with a guy from Kaliningrad, plays in the Center. Meyerhold speaks fluent Russian. She is in love with the Russian theater, communicates with relatives only in Skype and constantly drinks tea, which she never did in America. With tours Joe traveled all over Russia, in her free time translates plays from Russian to English and performs with her own band Sauce Kefal in restaurants and bars in Moscow. In the subway she reads Platonov and Rasputin, monitors the presidential elections in the US and considers the monarchy to be the best way of government.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c9meIxePMoUf0fXGWLGjII74KLh.jpg", "actors": ["Jordan Frye (herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
