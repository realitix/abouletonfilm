But Leo has problems as well, such as being hopelessly smitten with his leading lady, who chooses to reward his attentions by getting herself hitched to Harrigan's vulgar leading man, Buck Greenaway! This movie is based, extremely loosely, on the early career on Cecil B. De Mille.  - Written by Alfred Jingle", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8gStRD7PNLBjwrw6Tg5b6GxT3qN.jpg", "actors": ["Ryan O'Neal (Leo Taylor Harrigan)", "Burt Reynolds (Tom \"Buck\" Greenway)", "Tatum O'Neal (Alice Forsyte)", "Brian Keith (H.H.
