The demonized man goes on a rampage of bloody murders while being pursued by one of his female colleagues and a police officer. Horribly burned in an explosion, he still continues his ungodly crimes, including crucifying a woman upside down. A bishop sends for a mystic called \u201cThe Angel\u201d, a character who dresses in medieval clothing and is armed with a demon-destroying sword. The possessed archeologist transforms into a club-wielding monster and challenges The Angel in a duel to the death.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/doWqHrawpBJhaYtxATbPxZG0afO.jpg", "actors": ["Sergio Goyri (El Hombre)", "Telly Filippini (Dr. Rosa Maria Castro)", "Jorge Luke (Moran)", "Roberto Ballesteros (Jose Juan Jimenez)", "Ernesto G\u00f3mez Cruz (The Wizard)", "Agust\u00edn Bernal (The Beast)", "Alfonso Mungu\u00eda (Priest)", "Roberto Montiel (Priest)", "Juan Pel\u00e1ez (Bishop)", "Azela Robinson (Maria)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
