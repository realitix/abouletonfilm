During the past year I kept all the messages recorded on this machine, and then asked many of my friends for permission to shoot a ten second filmic portrait of them, with the messages used as a soundtrack. The resulting work is this piece which becomes a statement of the modern society and our technology at work.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
