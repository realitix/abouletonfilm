She allegedly murdered a Canadian tourist before disappearing without a trace. At least that is how the narrator, who was passing through the region at the time, remembers the story. Over the course of the interviews, the elusive Val\u00e9rie seems to disappear a second time, literally engulfed by the Alpine landscape, magnificently captured on film by Fran\u00e7ois Caillat. A haunting, imposing landscape, where chasms and precipices become metaphors, characters in a work of fiction that the camera turns into a documentary. A film in the form of an essay in which the director takes his work on memory to its highest degree of abstraction.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/86uIm96FLjCeCTGY2WHIjv9lKwy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "g4-1n7UvsdY"}
