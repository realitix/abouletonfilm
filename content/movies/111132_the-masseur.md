Twenty-year-old Iliac may not be the best masseur in the parlor, but when he catches the eye of a cold and calculating romance novelist looking for a cheap thrill, the icy indifference displayed by his paying lover does little more to warm the spirits than his sexually charged but emotionally distant girlfriend. Despite the resentment Iliac feels towards his late father for abandoning the family and embarking on a suicidal alcohol binge, the lovelorn youth nevertheless makes the journey home to be there for his grieving mother in her time of need.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fno3fe1vrsGfT2brBwqzv7dw0Hd.jpg", "actors": ["Coco Martin (Iliac)", "Jaclyn Jose (Naty)", "Allan Paule (Alfredo / Marina Hidalgo)", "Aaron Rivera (Maldon)", "Roni Bertubin (Manager)", "Norman Pineda (Edmond)", "John Baltazar (Anthony)", "Jan-el Esturco (Errand Boy)", "Maximiano Sultan (Rodel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [140447], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
