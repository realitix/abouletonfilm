The story concerns a poverty-stricken vagabond (Jean Martinelli) who supports himself by singing for pennies in a rough section of town. Only the local barkeeper knows that the vagabond is actually the illegitimate son of a prosperous and highly respected banker (Constant Remy). One would think that the film's dramatic climax would consist of a tearful reunion between father and son. Instead, this scene occurs in the middle of the picture; the rest of the film is a melodramatic melange of high emotionalism and low melodrama, culminating in the boy's suicide. Though billed first, Lya Gauty has an almost peripheral role as the hero's long-suffering sweetheart who sings at the drop of a hat and frequently brings her own hat.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tPPoElnQm1kWsT1utSB7sajUrLy.jpg", "actors": ["Lys Gauty (Marie-Jeanne, la Goualeuse)", "Constant R\u00e9my (Andr\u00e9 Laubier)", "Jean Martinelli (Pierre Duchemin)", "Marguerite Pierry (Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Pastoureau)", "Francine Bessy (Marcelle Laubier)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
