Gilas lost 85-81.  The key moment came with less than a minute left Gilas had the ball and was down just 2 points, and head coach Vincent Reyes had called timeout. But the drawn up play seemed to break down. Jayson William went up for a 3-pointer which appeared to be partially blocked. He came back down with the ball and was called for a travel.  Gilas was forced to foul and the game was over after Argentina made two free throws. Coach Chot Reyes said that the loss was painful.  \u201cIt\u2019s painful because the players worked so hard. I thought that we\u2019re happy that we\u2019re fighting, that we\u2019re competing against top 3 team in the world,\u201d said Reyes after the match But the team is showing great", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vPrDlQgKlgzdTkzPRzerSzLdbYO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
