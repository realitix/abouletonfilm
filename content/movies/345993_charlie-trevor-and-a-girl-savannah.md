Trevor has been having nightmares about his girlfriend Savannah. He begins to question what is true in his present life verses the perception in his waking dream. Even though this film can come off dark our goal was to express a universal message that can seem complicated, but is as simple as exploring the Mind, Body and Soul. Once we are able to accept these 3 traits of ourselves, we will realize this balance is just the beginning to life and self-discovery to the higher being. But, it first starts with Love, Trust and Faith. Meet, Charlie, Trevor, and A Girl Savannah", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/46iBC51wd2S7KyqpFKFDhOE970Z.jpg", "actors": ["Eric Roberts (Dr. Mc Millan)", "Ty Hodges (Charlie)", "Toby Hemingway (Trevor)", "Emily Meade (Savannah)", "Jackie Stewart (Genesis)", "Brendan Dooling (June Bug)", "Meagan Good ()", "Adam Senn (Marty)", "Joel Nagle (Mr. Jacobs)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "FvGwuUJnbKA"}
