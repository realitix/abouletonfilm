The Marine Band rendered a programme of popular music. The President's children entertained at least fifty young friends during the day with a view of the egg rolling from the balcony, but none of them mingled with the great throng, preferring to view the panorama from the distance. They were much amused with the antics of the great crowd of children, who were of all colors and from every walk of life.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sWY7im2gWqGM5FazpJNuqYWfrWh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [147469], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
