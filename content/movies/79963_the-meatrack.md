The film concerns an ostensibly straight married man who starts turning tricks on the sleazy streets of San Francisco, and it was shot almost entirely on location in the city\u2019s by-the-hour hotels, adult theatres, gay bars, and bathhouses. With real-life go-go boys, female impersonators, and leathermen as its supporting cast, it serves as a rich subcultural document.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dRfC1z7dmaj1VCvInhq7yWJ0G8g.jpg", "actors": ["David Calder (J.C.)", "Jan Stratton (Mother)", "Bob Romero (Father)", "Steve Ferris (Ken)", "Alan Dye (Preacher)", "Donna Troy (Jean)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
