The 9/11 event was so beyond my comprehension \u2013 you can understand and react to a death of one, or two persons\u201a but I could not react to the death of 2500 people \u2013 it was an abstraction, a fairy tale \u2013 that\u2019s why I framed my 9/11 film (shot from my roof) with the fairytale, with the image watching this story, the story of 9/11. Like any other fairy tale coming from the past \u2013 by this girl this child dreaming, listening, and dreaming about the tales coming from the past.  \u2015Jonas Mekas", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
