Acclaimed photographer Gillian Laub, whose photos first brought the area unwanted notoriety, documents the repercussions when a white town resident is charged with the murder of a young black man. The case divides locals along well-worn racial lines, and the ensuing plea bargain and sentencing uncover complex truths and produce emotional revelations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xplfeQRFqI3SBLMDxt4CPtopy8u.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
