Back in the 1980\u2019s they made powerful, skewed pop music with keyboardist Lee Stephens under the name \u201cFrom Nursery To Misery\u201d; self-releasing scores of cassettes from their bedroom in Essex. They also toured around Europe and posed on the cover of Psychic TV\u2019s Hex Sex on the way. Now in their forties, and living a life of self-imposed isolation, the film tells the unlikely story of the band\u2019s short existence, before picking up the thread of the twins\u2019 eccentric life together now.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
