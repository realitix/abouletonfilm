The set includes quintessential hits about loving and letting go from the seven-time Grammy winner\u2019s days as a confessional rock phenomenon: \u201cAll I Really Want,\u201d \u201cHands Clean,\u201d \u201cThank U\u201d and \u201cUninvited.\u201d The singer/songwriter also introduces fans to her latest and most adventurous album, So-Called Chaos, with songs including \u201cEight Easy Steps,\u201d and \u201cExcuses,\u201d among others. The honest, unadulterated performance reflects Morissette\u2019s move away from her days as a rancorous 90\u2019s rocker, and into the mode of mature musician ready to experiment with her strengths. Morissette\u2019s enduring introspection, continual evolution and evocative stage presence shine in this performance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r1sqVV1oppqqKAZU6lNG1nvMTuA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
