Burne-Jones plays matchmaker for a young British nobleman who has fallen in love with a servant girl on his estate. The artist shows that love can thrive between members of different classes by depicting on canvas a picture from Tennyson's poem about the love of King Cophetua for a beggar maid. As he relates the story of the poem in words and through his painting, the young earl sees the application to his own situation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/49kgqIj7f36YcMPksIe3TgX7d5h.jpg", "actors": ["Reginald Denny ()", "Mary Astor ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
