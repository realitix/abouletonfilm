Along the way, she pokes fun at air travel, the quirks of some of the biggest international airlines and some of the stereotypes commonly held about flight attendants everywhere. Her genius is in mixing camp, culture, humor, fabulousness and a bit of slapstick into an outrageous in-flight cocktail that the likes of Elton John has hired for his own private jet (but Pam won\u2019t tell us if he was a good passenger or not!).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iulYIeJ1SqrCmrYjJTd5hX1ghk7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
