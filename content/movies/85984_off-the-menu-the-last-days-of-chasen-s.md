During its two final weeks, Chasen regulars (actors and producers), staff, and management sat for interviews. There's an Oscar party for 1500, footage and photos of famous diners, and time with Tommy Gallagher, the ebullient head waiter until retirement in 1994, his son Patrick, catering head Raymond Bilbool, general manager Ronnie Clint, hat check girl Val Schwab, ladies' room attendant Onetta Johnson, and foreign- born waiters, including Jaime. When he started in 1970, like other Latins, he wasn't allowed out of the kitchen. It's a family farewell.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1pE8eJz3QraW4VHVwJFCsCz5mVI.jpg", "actors": ["Sally Kellerman (Herself)", "Martin Landau (Himself)", "David Frost (Himself)", "Ed McMahon (Himself)", "Margaret O'Brien (Herself)", "Suzanne Pleshette (Herself)", "Don Rickles (Himself)", "Sharon Stone (Herself)", "Robert Wagner (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
