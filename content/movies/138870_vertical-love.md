This brings her into contact with earthy, cynical hospital nurse Ernesto (Jorge Perugorria). Estela invites him home for dinner, and he succeeds in offending everyone present. Unable to find a quiet spot to be alone, they finally find a squatters' tenement, where their sexual frenzy causes a ceiling to collapse. They next try vertical love in a stalled elevator, trapping people in the modern building minus stairs. Fleeing responsibilities, they stage a romantic rendezvous alongside a country river, but once again they are interrupted as Cuban commissars arrive with papers and forms because the couple constructs a hut beneath a bridge. Amid the misadventures, lust turns to love", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tp7EBpneeuX8yn4tbe2qcCiW58R.jpg", "actors": ["Jorge Perugorr\u00eda ()", "Silvia \u00c1guila ()", "Susana P\u00e9rez ()", "Osvaldo Doimeadi\u00f3s (Sargento Garrido)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
