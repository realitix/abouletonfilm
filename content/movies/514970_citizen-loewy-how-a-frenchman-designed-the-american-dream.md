A designer with the golden touch - such a genius that he could cross the US by air, rail, or road, stylishly seated in a plane, train, or automobile he'd designed himself!  French designer Raymond Loewy was a star when the American Way of Life was at its flamboyant capitalist peak. He styled his own destiny as a Hollywood thriller. After all, he was a tycoon, a New York celebrity. Yet by the end of his life, he\u2019d been forgotten. He took the mystery of his iconic Coca-Cola bottle to the grave with him. The bigger they are, the harder they fall: One day, megalomania got the better of Loewy, and he came to a tragic end. Suspense, drama, twists of fate: Loewy invented the medium as the message.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wcvZWv225vYHqjSybOuBHvU9u3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
