It was shot in the mid-1950s in Mexico City, during the postproduction of Touch of Evil.  It\u2019s set in a movie theater, features child actress Patty McCormack as herself, Francesco Riguera as Quixote, and Akim Tamiroff (perhaps Welles\u2019s favorite character actor, who also appears in Mr. Arkadin, Touch of Evil, and The Trial) as Sancho Panza, and is fully edited by Welles.\" - Jonathan Rosenbaum, Unseen Orson Welles", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Patty McCormack (herself)", "Francesco Riguera (Don Quixote)", "Akim Tamiroff (Sancho Panza)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
