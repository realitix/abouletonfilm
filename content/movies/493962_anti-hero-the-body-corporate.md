That wasn\u2019t the original title we had in mind. We were pushing for \u201cReality Breakdown\u201d. But things changed along the way. The video itself came out a lot different than the video we thought we were making, and that\u2019s not a bad thing. This is the video we came back from New Zealand with. It morphed from wanting to tell a story about skating being an act of defiance, a path away from the status quo & spoon fed commercialism & all that lazy stuff, to being the story of what drew these guys to skateboarding & why it sticks so strongly with some of us. In the end it still speaks to those other ideas, though not said out-loud. These guys poured their hearts into this thing & we couldn\u2019t be more stoked on how it came out. We hope you dig it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1JxXd2O0109wZogULn6icK4hEOS.jpg", "actors": ["Frank Gerwer (Himself)", "Raney Beres (Himself)", "Brian Anderson (Himself)", "Robbie Russo (Himself)", "Daan Van Der Linden (Himself)", "Jeff Grosso (Himself)", "Julien Stranger (Himself)", "Sean Gutierrez (Himself)", "Pat McLain (Himself)", "Grant Taylor (Himself)", "Peter Hewitt (Himself)", "Chris Pfanner (Himself)", "Lord Div Adam (Himself)", "Austin Kanfoush (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
