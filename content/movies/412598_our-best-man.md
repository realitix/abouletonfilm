He takes on an apprenticeship as a building-worker, which makes him a member of a building brigade. At the same time Otto tries to start a love affair, which he handles even clumsier. Never the less Otto makes progress with the lady in question, a single mother, who apparently doesn't mind. Actually he wanted her sister, but a retired Leninist party member changes his mind. This gives him the courage to persevere in his work, albeit with the helping hand of the obligatory retired party member. And behold, in the end Otto invents a new method of building, which saves the brigade many hours of work.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cFaelH6urDfIaK4kz1JgfLFmln2.jpg", "actors": ["Heinz Rennhack (Otto Vegesack)", "Werner Senftleben (Molly Seibt)", "Willi Schrade (Don Lachmann)", "Brigitte Krause (Frau Hielscher)", "Viola Schweizer (Fr\u00e4ulein Hill)", "G\u00fcnter Schubert (Pacholke)", "Arnim M\u00fchlst\u00e4dt (Erster Fernfahrer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
