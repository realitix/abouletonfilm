This two-hour-plus DVD captures most of one concert by the four rappers who joined together for this tour: Ice Cube, Eminem, Dr. Dre, and Snoop Dogg. If you aren't a fan of the music, don't expect this to change your mind or even to help you understand these rappers' appeal. For the devoted, however, you get heaping doses of four of the hottest acts working, in a show that includes lavish production values as well as plenty of backstage footage and photographs as extra features. Given the slice-and-dice editing (no shot, it seems, is allowed to last more than two seconds), it's hard to get a fix on them or a true picture of what the show looked like if you happened to be sitting in the audience."}], "recommandations_id": [49039, 36923, 105941, 273181]}
