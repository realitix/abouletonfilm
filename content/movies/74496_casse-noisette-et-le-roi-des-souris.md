The mouse-king seeks the magic that made this happen so that he can become all-powerful. The prince (now a nutcracker) finds hope in the form of a girl who risks everything to help him become real again, while the mouse-king and his armies do everything they can to steal the magic for themselves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yWcaOUv8uJe2Tot8Pt1rWt7CC6X.jpg", "actors": ["Wolfgang V\u00f6lz (Mausek\u00f6nig (Mouseking) (voice))", "Rufus Beck (Squeak (voice))", "Hannes Jaenicke (Bubble (voice))", "Volker Brandt (Drosselmeier (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [37319], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
