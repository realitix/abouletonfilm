You can expect insight from heroes like Bill Johnson, Heidi Baker, Kris Vallotton, Todd White, Shawn Bolz, Randy Clark and many more.  In order to keep the movie real and practical we will show you how ordinary Christians bring light to dark places so you would know step by step on how to do it yourself. The movie will include footage of outreaches and street evangelism in Asia, the U.S. and Europe. We also have exclusive footage from the historical Azusa Now event, where over a 100,000 people were involved to seek the greatest move of God this world has ever seen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ofI3Cn6GCLzOYxHwstN4D5tVrpJ.jpg", "actors": ["Heidi Baker ()", "Randy Clark ()", "Loren Cunningham ()", "Andres Bisonni ()", "Robby Dawkins ()", "Bill Johnso ()", "Daniel Kolenda ()", "Mark Marx ()", "Mark Marx ()", "Kris Vallotton ()", "Todd White ()"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "joshuabeny1999", "content": "I saw this film on a premiere in Switzerland.
