Throughout their colourful history the steam locomotive has always held a very special place in the hearts of millions of people.  This information over view of the development of the steam engine introduced and scripted by Nigel Harris, brings vividly to life \"The Story of Steam\".  From the early days through the exciting development of the steam engine right up to today's surviving preserved and working steam railways. Using a unique blend of newsreed, archive film and contemporary action this programme traces the development of the great steam engines from 'Rocket' to 'Evening Star'.
