As national wealth expanded, two classes rose simultaneously, separated by a gulf of experience and circumstance that was unprecedented in American life. These disparities sparked passionate and violent debate over questions still being asked in our own times: How is wealth best distributed, and by what process? Does government exist to protect private property or provide balm to the inevitable casualties of a churning industrial system?  The outcome of these disputes was both uncertain and momentous, and marked by a passionate vitriol and level of violence that would shock the conscience of many Americans today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vcEu1OX4iM7rVr9CPs9fEQOFHjf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
