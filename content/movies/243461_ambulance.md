Morgenstern\u2019s presentation of the incident serves as a metaphor for the horror of the Holocaust, and provides a powerful trigger for discussion of the disturbing issues raised by the film. The figure of the children's\u2019 teacher specifically parallels Janusz Korcak (1879-1942), a famous Jewish educator who ran an orphanage in the Warsaw ghetto and died with his young charges at Treblinka.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/22VgMsAdkXaHDUaT7Y1EzRvyQFJ.jpg", "actors": ["Zbigniew J\u00f3zefowicz (SS-man (uncredited))", "Leopold Rene Nowak (Driver (uncredited))", "Marek Sniatkiewicz (Boy (uncredited))", "Bogus\u0142aw Sochnacki (Watchman (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
