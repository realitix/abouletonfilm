He selects Linus as his pit crew and goes to a store to select a bike, and due to insufficient funds, he must settle for a tiny, run-down putt-putt. The majority of Charlie's opponents are eliminated in the race, and Charlie, wearing a makeshift helmet carved from a pumpkin, finds himself in close competition with his friend, tomboy Peppermint Patty, and the Masked Marvel (a.k.a. Snoopy, Charlie's dog).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eThpZRoaypddRm1rTw1LEa2QrzI.jpg", "actors": ["Duncan Watson (Charlie Brown / Franklin / Kid (voice))", "Melanie Kohn (Lucy van Pelt / Loretta (voice))", "Stuart Brotman (Patricia \"Peppermint Patty\" Reichardt (voice))", "Jimmy Ahrens (Marcie (voice))", "Liam Martin (Linus van Pelt / Schroeder (voice))", "Bill Melendez (Snoopy / Woodstock (voice) (uncredited))", "Gail Davis (Sally Brown (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [54912, 40484, 40489, 52446], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
