Nadji has sought refuge at the California home of Frank Chandler, an American educated in the Ancient East and familiar with White Magic and thus calls himself \"Chandu\". Vindhyan, high priest of the cult's California base has learned of this, however, and works his Black Magic to gain control of Nadji. Chandu is able to rescue her but she is in a deep trance which he cannot penetrate, so attempts to move her to safety in the South Seas, unaware that the cult has a base there also and that Vindhyan has stowed aboard his chartered yacht.  One of two feature films edited from the same-title, same-year movie serial, this one is comprised of the first four chapters simply edited together.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mFHuXn3CzmNYrugZewHV9XT5EMm.jpg", "actors": ["Bela Lugosi (Frank Chandler (Chandu))", "Maria Alba (Princess Nadji)", "Lucien Prival (Vindhyan)", "Clara Kimball Young (Mrs. Dorothy Regent)", "Dean Benton (Bob Regent)", "Phyllis Ludwig (Betty Regent)", "Cyril Armbrister (Sutra, henchman)", "Elias Lazaroff (Bara, henchman)", "Dick Botiller (Morta, henchman)", "Frazer Acosta (Nito, the butler)", "Bryant Washburn (Prince Andra)", "Baby Peggy (Judy Allen)", "Isabel La Mal (Mrs. James)", "Charles Meecham (Mr. James)", "Don Brodie (Daily Star Reporter)", "Edward Peil Sr. (Airport Official)", "Henry Hall (Museum Curator)", "Frank Lanning (Fake Constable)", "Murdock MacQuarrie (High Priest in Lemuria)", "April Armbrister (Suvanese Knife Dancer)", "Louise Emmons (Sisaba, the Hag)", "Harry Walker (Yacht Servant)", "Beatrice Roberts (Party Guest)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
