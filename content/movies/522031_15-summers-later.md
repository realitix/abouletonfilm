Laila and Aksel, a couple in their late twenties, are enjoying the opportunity to relax and unwind near the sea. Halvard, an old classmate of Laila\u2019s, happens to be having a walk at the very same place. Although it has been twelve years since they last saw each other, Halvard\u2019s memories seem much more vivid than Laila\u2019s.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b9P7xbva3jqrgFdgdVQq5ebk2K8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
