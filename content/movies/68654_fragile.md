FRAGILE is a short parable about the things we often take for granted until they are gone, like friendship and love from those that are close to us. It is a film about the precious gift of life, and the fragility of our existence. Death, its imminence and certainty despite our efforts to deny it, is examined in a meditative manner. FRAGILE entertains by means of serious reflection and lyrical contemplation.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Helga G\u00f6ring (Kathrin's Mother)", "Sophie Hechler (Carla)", "Joachim Nimtz (Angel)", "Verena Rendtorff (Christoph's Assistent)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
