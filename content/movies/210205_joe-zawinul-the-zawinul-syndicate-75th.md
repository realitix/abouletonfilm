This titan of the jazz world \u2013 whose innovative and genre-bending sensibilities gave rise to such visionary musical entities as Weather Report and the Zawinul Syndicate \u2013 took his final bow on September 11, 2007, at age 75 after a battle with cancer. Recorded in concert at a festival date in Lugano, Switzerland, on July 7, 2007, this aptly titled concert video is unwavering proof that Zawinul, like so many great artists, clearly saved some of his best work for last. This is a perfect companion piece to the 75 audio CD, which garnered a GRAMMY in 2010 for Best Contemporary Jazz Album.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jaM6nZ4mMCoo1cpZAmoQaKIL9Y6.jpg", "actors": ["Joe Zawinul (himself)", "Sabine Kabongo (herself)", "Alegre Correa (himself)", "Linley Marthe (Bass)", "Paco Sery (himself)", "Jorge Bezerra (himself)", "Wayne Shorter (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "fRkutANfg-A"}
