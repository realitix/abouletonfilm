Once in Jamaica, Max quickly escapes the tourist zone for more \"authentic\" surroundings and in the process is robbed of his possessions and is stranded, and literally misses the boat. As Max sets out for the American Embassy in Kingston on foot, Jamaica is waiting to meet him with unexpected and extraordinary encounters, including a full-moon celebration with the legendary reggae group The Congos, and a dreamy stay with a Rasta prophet (Carl Bradshaw, THE HARDER THEY COME).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nCxuusklJuo96uNA8ERuvWgxxaY.jpg", "actors": ["Sean Bones (Max)", "Norah Jones (Willow)", "Kevin Bewersdorf ()", "Mark Gibbs ()", "Carl Bradshaw (Mystic Man)", "Ira-Wolf Tuton ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [74666], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
