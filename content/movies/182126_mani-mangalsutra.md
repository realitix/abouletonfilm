Young Film maker Gauri Karekar Sarwate was so much inspired by this unusual story written by her late mother-in-law, that she decided to make a film on this true story.  The film portrays the camouflaged values of our Indian culture and successfully displays the unwavering bonds between husband and wife irrespective of cast, creed and nationality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1wPUUrEw0KFLooDOi0YvJSxrtQZ.jpg", "actors": ["Hrishitaa Bhatt (Savitri)", "Ravindra Mankani (School Master)", "Anjali Kusre (Swati)", "Umesh Kamat (Shantanu)", "Lalan Sarang ()", "Ashalata Wabgaokar ()", "Vandana Gupte ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
