Much of Elgar's work -- including the \"Pomp and Circumstance\" marches -- was inspired by his love for his homeland, and he remains the classical composer most closely associated with western England.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
