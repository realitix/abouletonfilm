A hauntingly sterile emergency room. A girl crying out for her Father: God. One by one, all of the players in her life, angels and devils alike, emerge and illuminate how she ended up in this liminal consciousness between life and death. It is both in this consciousness and her previous existence that she begins to understand why God had forsaken her and how she can be redeemed. Dreamlike, visceral, and at times surreal, It's Hard to Be Human elegantly poses the age-old questions of what it means to be human and how to have a connection with the Divine in a fallibly human world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bhlBxwDGbdNdkt8865saoIdz4XR.jpg", "actors": ["Nina Gilmour (Agnes)", "Tom Wilson (God)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
