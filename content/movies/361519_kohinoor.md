It was a time when Mammootty\u2019s \u2018Athirathram\u2019 and Mohanlal\u2019s \u2018Irupatham Noottandu\u2019 were such a rage among youth. Louis (Asif Ali) wishes to be like Tharadas and Sagar Alias Jacky, the heroes in these movies. If not, at least become a junior Tharadas or Sagar Alias Jacky; to earn wealth and name and thus become famous. When Louis set out with such an aim, he is joined by his close companion Aandikkunju (Aju Varghese), Haider (Indrajith) from Mumbai, Freddy (Vinay Forrt) from Kochi, and Freddy\u2019s friend Nicholas (Chemban Vinod Jose).
