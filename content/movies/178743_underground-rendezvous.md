Yet as soon as he reaches the city, his money is stolen and his bags are lost. He manages to reach a remote town, where coincidentally they were looking for a new teacher for the town children. He soon falls in love with a woman there, yet her origin seems vague as the townspeople only say she comes from somewhere up North.
