Reluctantly, McKenna accepts the role of chosen one. With the amulet and after the rigors of the ritual, she takes on the spirit and powers of the raven, the good forces in the battle against evil, the wolf. McKenna's powers include a thirst for milk and great sexual energy, which she unleashes on her former boyfriend, Henry, a cop. The spirit of the wolf inhabits Rose, Henry's jilted lover. Rose wreaks havoc of her own before a final showdown with the chosen one. Carmen Electra appears nude in this film although some have suggested it is a body double.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rbDoofIT1qbAAj0s4sdcO1S21uy.jpg", "actors": ["Carmen Electra (McKenna Ray / The Raven)", "Shauna Sand (Emma)", "Michael Stadvec (Cole)", "Debra K.
