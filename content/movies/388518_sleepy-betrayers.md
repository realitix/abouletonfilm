Eventually, the girl (on the advice of friends) turns the tables on him, and claims to have outside relationships of her own. This prompts him to move out in a huff, into the flat of a casual conquest of his, but he soon discovers that his poor manners have resulted in his not being welcome anywhere.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tEJgCXNbCuowVglIm1UOrz6nWaP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
