They are arranging for the gradual smuggling of components into Iran to build a small nuclear weapon, for which they use eleven mules, each carrying a different part. The plan is that one week before the International Atomic Energy Agency is to inspect Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, they will detonate the bomb near a famous sports stadium in Tehran in order to cause mayhem and mass destruction and discredit the Iranian government.
