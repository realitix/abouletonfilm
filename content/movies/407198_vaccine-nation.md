The use of heavy metals such as mercury, connections to autism and the high number of vaccines given at a very young age to children are among the arguments presented. The story chronicles the nightmare of parents who lost a child soon after a vaccination series and the father was sent to prison for murdering his child but was later released. Government cover-ups and deceptions with corruption in the scientific community are illustrated by those featured in Vaccine Nation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2b37MKTZfRLnlXvufT6f0lgMLi5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
