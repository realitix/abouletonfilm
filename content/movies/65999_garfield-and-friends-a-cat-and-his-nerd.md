Jo may not be much, but he's the only human they've got! He's not always purr-fectly well behaved, but Garfield is always there for Jon and Odie - there on the couch, there eating lasagne... but he's also there as a friend. So whether Jon's dealing with a lackluster love life, courting car trouble or even being conned by a convict, Garfield is one fat and furry friend for life!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pjtMNrMDXj1fVA1eriCL4bOjRP7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
