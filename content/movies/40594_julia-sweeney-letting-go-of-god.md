Brought up Roman Catholic, she started having questions about religion after reading the bible. Whether you believe in God or not, her arguments and questions are insightful and provocative. She approaches the subject with an astute mind, looking into multiple religions and delving deeper than most people care to. Many people follow religion blindly, and accepting whatever they are told by their minister. You will follow Julia Sweeney as she attempts to reconcile her faith in God before ultimately, letting go."}], "recommandations_id": [126816, 56962], "youtube_key": "geRUTfgTQlo"}
