Then Adam meets Eve, starts falling in love, but gets jealous of frat-brother Billy, who 'bumps' almost constantly without seeking love, while Eve guards her campus-unique virginity. As even his thrice-divorced dad, an MD, urges Adam to get laid rather then loved, his patience runs out against healthy hormones", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4pZPniM9TpF6YgSUF3bDZg5NCTS.jpg", "actors": ["Cameron Douglas (Adam)", "Emmanuelle Chriqui (Eve)", "Chad Lindberg (Freddie)", "Jake Hoffman (Ferguson)", "Brian Klugman (Munch)", "Branden Williams (Billy)", "Courtney Peldon (Patty)", "George Dzundza (Eve's Dad)", "Lacey Beeman (Mandy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [113211, 66044, 79876, 88651], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
