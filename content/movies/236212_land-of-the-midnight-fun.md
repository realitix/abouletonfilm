On arrival, we see some local scenes: A penguin eats two fish, then is eaten by the third; the dogs of a dog sled stop (behind an iceberg) at a telephone pole; a timber wolf goes around shouting \"Timber!\" Two Eskimos rub noses: in preparation, the woman applies lipstick to her nose. Finally, an Eskimo nightclub (after all, the nights are six months long) features a rotoscoped ice skater. The ship leaves, and gets caught in the fog near New York; when the fog clears, we see the ship is perched atop the World's Fair Trilon.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p1djEAP2cMwuYjQTxL7ocUVF9p5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
