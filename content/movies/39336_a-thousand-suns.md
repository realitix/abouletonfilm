This isolated area has remained remarkably intact both biologically and culturally. It is one of the most densely populated rural regions of Africa yet its people have been farming sustainably for 10,000 years. Shot in Ethiopia, New York and Kenya, the film explores the modern world's untenable sense of separation from and superiority over nature and how the interconnected worldview of the Gamo people is fundamental in achieving long-term sustainability, both in the region and beyond.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ide1zt99EI37Wn9TmBhRkAmnOi0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
