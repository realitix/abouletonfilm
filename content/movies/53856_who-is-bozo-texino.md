Mostly shot on freight trips across the western US, the film includes interviews with some of the railroad\u2019s greatest graffiti legends: Colossus of Roads, The Rambler, Herby (RIP) and the granddaddy of them all, Bozo Texino. The film also catches some of the socio-economic history of hobo subculture from its roots after the Civil War to the present day. The range of the interviews, and the film\u2019s style deal with both the clich\u00e9s and the harsh realities of tramp life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7hdWo5Prbrot3Zdbl1r3AzokqUe.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
