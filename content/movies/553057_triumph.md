With Albanian fans not permitted to attend the game due to purported safety concerns, the stadium full of Serbian fans echoed racist chants and death threats. Tensions rose to a boil when a drone carrying an Albanian flag flew above the players and onto the pitch. Angered fans rushed the field, attacking the Albanian players, forcing the match to end. A history of political tensions, war and genocide is explored as we follow the journey of the Albanian National Team to their first EURO cup appearance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3Ow8xUC29OEHpIXafRx4jtgmHU3.jpg", "actors": ["Lorik Cana ()", "Gianni De Biasi ()", "Shk\u00eblzen Gashi ()", "Paolo Tramezzani ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
