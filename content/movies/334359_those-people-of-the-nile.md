Beginning with the day the waters of the Nile were diverted, Chahine shows how individual concerns sometimes outweigh the myth surrounding a collective undertaking. The first Egyptian-Soviet co-production was shown to its two sponsor governments in 1968, inspiring considerable displeasure. Re-editing was demanded; along with newly shot sequences using actors. Consequently, the film was not shown until 1972.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4C19Q1WEFPiL1XdE7YwRywphk79.jpg", "actors": ["Soad Hosny ()", "Salah Zulfikar ()", "Igor Vladimirov ()", "Ezzat El Alaili ()", "Vladimir Ivashov ()", "Seif El Dine ()", "Yuri Kamornyj ()", "Mahmoud el-Meliguy ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
