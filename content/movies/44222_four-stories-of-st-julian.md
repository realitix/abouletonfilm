An assassin, a religious zealot, a mother, and a thief...just moments after being confined, it becomes clear that one of them is mortally wounded. As the minutes tick by, a battle for survival ensues where each of them is forced to examine their sordid ties to St. Julian-the building, as well as the legacy of the religious figure.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k7KmmkyzmmCgt204fAAJsADzFyv.jpg", "actors": ["Ky Evans ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
