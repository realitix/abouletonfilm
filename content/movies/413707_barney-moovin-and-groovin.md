As they learn about rhythm and create their own musical instruments, Barney leads the band with a rat-a-tat-tat and a rooty-toot-toot. And they discover there are lots of ways to get a move on as they do the Baby Bop-Hop and the Dino Dance. Then, after wiggling through a game of Simon Says, they're off to the races. Barney's friends discover the fun of movement while making beautiful music together!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qUk6AJCWbgQyRCx7f7BR66bq9er.jpg", "actors": ["Jeff Ayers (Baby Bop)", "Carey Stinson (Barney)", "Dean Wednt (Barney (Voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
