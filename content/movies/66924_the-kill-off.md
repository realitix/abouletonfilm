The owner, Pete (played by Jackson Sims), can barely make the payroll so in an effort to bring in more business, he hires a sultry stripper named Danny Lee (Cathy Haase). Danny Lee's act soon turns the head of Ralph, which is not good news for his bed-ridden wife Luanne (Loretta Gross). Luanne's nasty talent is her gift for gossip, and when she begins to suspect that Ralph has adultery on his mind, she starts spreading more ugly rumors that have just enough basis in fact to stick. Soon things spin out of control and a wave of violence begins.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2i1PRfs3BtVAEF3JCvXUPgF72hE.jpg", "actors": ["Loretta Gross (Luane)", "Andrew Lee Barrett (Bobbie Ashton)", "Jackson Sims (Pete Pavlov)", "Steve Monroe (Ralph)", "Cathy Haase (Danny Lee)", "Jorja Fox (Myra Pavlov (as Jorjan Fox))", "William Russell (Rags)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
