He first convinces the ailing King that the Duke of Clarence, his elder brother, is a threat to the lives of Edward's two young sons. Edward has him imprisoned in the Tower of London; killers in Richard's pay then drown Clarence in a barrel of wine. When news of Clarence's death reaches the King, the subsequent grief and remorse bring about his death. Richard is made Lord Protector, with power to rule England while his nephew (now King Edward V) is still a minor. Before the young king's coronation he has his two nephews conveyed to the Tower, ostensibly for their safekeeping. Richard's accomplice, the Duke of Buckingham, then declares the two boys illegitimate and offers Richard the crown, which after a show of reticence he accepts. After Richard's coronation, he and Buckingham have a falling-out over whether or not to assassinate the two children.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gbueSvlt04ANKO2DNI8G4vI2feX.jpg", "actors": ["Ron Cook (Richard III)", "Peter Benson (King Henry VI)", "Michael Byrne (Duke of Buckingham)", "Julia Foster (Queen Margaret)", "Bernard Hill (First Murderer)", "Zo\u00eb Wanamaker (Lady Anne)", "Mark Wing-Davey (First Citizen / Sir James Tyrrel)", "Brian Protheroe (King Edward IV)", "Antony Brown (Sir Richard Ratcliffe)", "David Burke (Sir William Catesby)", "Anne Carroll (Jane Shore)", "Paul Chapman (Earl Rivers)", "Rowena Cooper (Queen Elizabeth)", "Arthur Cox (Lord Grey / Lord Mayor of London)", "Annette Crosbie (Duchess of York)", "David Daker (Lord Hastings)", "Brian Deacon (Second Citizen / First Messenger / Earl of Richmond)", "Jeremy Dimmick (Young Duke of York)", "Tenniel Evans (Stanley, Earl of Derby / Archbishop of York)", "Derek Farr (Sir Robert Brackenbury / Earl of Surrey)", "Dorian Ford (Edward, Prince of Wales)", "Derek Fuke (Second Murderer / Sir Thomas Vaughan)", "Alex Guard (Marquess of Dorset)", "Paul Jesson (George, Duke of Clarence)", "Patsy Kensit (Lady Margaret Plantagenet)", "Rusty Livingstone (Page to Richard)", "Oengus MacNamara (Halberdier / Lord Lovell)", "Nick Reding (Ghost of Prince of Wales)", "Stephen Rooney (Edward Plantagenet)", "Peter Wyatt (Duke of Norfolk)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
