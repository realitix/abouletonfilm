I had written a book of about one-hundred pages in the surrealist tradition of \"automatic writing,\" which I called the \"Cloud Journal.\" I thought I could marry some of the text of the journal with the collages of Ernst's UNE SEMAINE DE BONTE, along with bits of my own animation. So I shot the film on day one of the Ernst collage novel (example: lion), and used the first sixteen pages of my journal. I enlisted my friend and collaborator, Leroy Clark, to narrate and engineer the sound. We finished up digitally, then on 16mm film (the original format). I have nothing esoteric to say about this film, except to explain the title: it is a tribute to Luis Bunuel. There is no walrus in the film, as there is no dog in UN CHIEN ANDALOU.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/boD4mrtEOvnj0TKEpIW5dtteiff.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
