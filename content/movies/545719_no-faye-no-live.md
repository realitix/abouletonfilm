Faye's spectrums of songs are all on display. Faye performs many of her hits from over the years, some with new arrangements. Faye also surprised her fans and performs two English covers, Blondie's Hearts of Glass and Burt Bacharach's The Look of Love. Faye's English is quite good, as she had studied in the States in her early years. The songs were really a great treat. Maybe she is hinting of things to come for all her fans. Hopefully the Queen of Pop will crossover and do an English cover for her oversea fans. Faye is one of the most creative and experimental female artists in all of Asia.  With over 30 musical songs, Faye mesmerized her audience with her electrifying and passionate performance. You can see her fans at the concert were in awe as they sat silent listening to Faye's amazing voice. She sang many of her top hits including Dream Lover, Sky, Brink of Love and Pain, Cold War, and Date.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rx6PnyxMSefRyqOUhI6y4cTu4xL.jpg", "actors": ["Faye Wong (Faye Wong)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
