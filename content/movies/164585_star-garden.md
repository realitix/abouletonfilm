Then the imaginary sun begins its course throughout whatever darkened room this film is seen within. At \"high noon\" (of the narrative) it can be imagined as if in back of the screen, and then to shift its imagined light-source gradually back thru aftertones and imaginings of the \"stars\" of the film till it achieves a one-to-one relationship with the moon again. This \"sun\" of the mind's eye of every viewer does not necessarily correspond with the off-screen \"pictured sun\" of the film; but anyone who plays this game of illumination will surely see the film in its most completely conscious light.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/65om3Pu5ghLeoFzKu7u5fv9mia3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [102389, 149072, 164601, 142192], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
