During this time over 100,000 people were arrested without charge and imprisoned without trial. They were released only by the government that replaced Ghandi's. The film also shows that political prisoners existed in India before the state of emergency and continued after the new government was elected.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yss3sAPLlMaJEb3qO0sKqY4EtiS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
