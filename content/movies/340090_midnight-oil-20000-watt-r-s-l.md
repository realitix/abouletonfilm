The word \"Collection\" appears on the front of the DVD along the hinge in the same type face as the title and the name of the band and may have been intended as part of the album's title; however, it does not appear on the spine. The release has also been distributed inside a cardboard sleeve which adds \"Midnight Oil: The Hits\" to the album art, distinguishing it as a compilation album.  The compilation covers the majority of Midnight Oil's career, starting with their 1979 album Head Injuries, and includes tracks from all their major studio releases (and one EP), even including two songs from Redneck Wonderland, which was released after the compilation in 1998.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kDlUdxaWZY5NRnlQaol6HlCJFg6.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Garrett (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
