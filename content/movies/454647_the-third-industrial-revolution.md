Our biosphere's inability to absorb human activity, combined with the exhaustion of natural resources, declining productivity, slow growth, rising unemployment, and steep inequality, forces us to rethink our economic models. Where do we go from here? In this compelling feature-length documentary, social and economic theorist Jeremy Rifkin lays out a road map to usher in a new era of sustainable development. A Third Industrial Revolution will unfold when three technologies emerge and converge: new communication, new sources of energy, and new modes of mobility. But, in the context of climate change, it needs to happen fast. Change of this magnitude requires political will and a profound ideological shift.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9o20zQursy1o9NoSIWpwGAmBiAQ.jpg", "actors": ["Jeremy Rifkin (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
