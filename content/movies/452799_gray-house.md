But as meditations upon nature, isolation, decadence, and destitution, they are flawless conduits for seamless blends of documentary and narrative form, and stunning explorations of sound, image, and cinematic time. Mysterious and elusive, yet possessing an aesthetic and sensory unity (appearances by Denis Lavant, Aurore Cl\u00e9ment, and Dianna Molzan mix with direct addresses from real-life laborers and inmates), GRAY HOUSE quietly recalibrates one\u2019s sense of the world and our place within it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1zvo1APzXApzu1RFdP0ZM1JINBS.jpg", "actors": ["Aurore Cl\u00e9ment ()", "Denis Lavant ()", "Dianna Molzan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
