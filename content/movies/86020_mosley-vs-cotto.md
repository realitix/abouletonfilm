When referee Benjy Estevez Jr. finally dropped his arms as they were parallel to the deck - signaling the start of the fight - it was both the initiation, and culmination of one man's hell of a journey.  From the opening bell there were signs that most who predicted a Mosley victory - (myself included) - would be in for quite a surprise.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cxzcL4YPVIRYHkgwr2ZRHB5RZDR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
