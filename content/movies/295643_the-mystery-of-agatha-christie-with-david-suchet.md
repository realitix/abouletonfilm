Suchet is embarking on a journey to learn more about the woman who created Poirot and whose books remain outsold only by Shakespeare and the Bible. Suchet's journey takes him to the places Christie lived, the landscapes that inspired her and to meetings with people who knew the woman behind the fame and those inspired by her extraordinary legacy. He explores the close links between Christie's extraordinary life and her work and discovers what it was about the woman from a small seaside town that allowed her to become the best-selling murder mystery writer in history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tOX9YHCbh0IRMX1y2trbkp9ompt.jpg", "actors": ["David Suchet (Himself - Presenter / Narrator)", "Mathew Prichard (Himself)", "Rosalind Christie (Herself, Agatha Christie's daughter (archive footage))", "Agatha Christie (Herself (archive footage))", "Laura Thompson (Herself - Biographer)", "Ali Marshall (Herself - Agatha Christie's Potent Plants)", "Bettany Hughes (Herself - Historian)", "Janet Morgan (Herself - Biographer)", "Barbara Nadel (Herself - Author)", "Elaine Kidwell (Herself - Agatha Christie Fan)", "Tom Adams (Himself - Artist)", "John Curran (Himself, author and lifelong Agatha Christie fan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
