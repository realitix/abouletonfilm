Overwhelmed by riots and tensions, Miami was a city in flux, and the University of Miami football team served as a microcosm for this evolution. The image of the predominantly white university was forever changed when coach Howard Schnellenberger scoured some of the toughest ghettos in Florida to recruit mostly black players for his team. With a newly branded swagger, inspired and fueled by the quickly growing local Miami hip hop culture, these Hurricanes took on larger-than-life personalities and won four national titles between 1983 and 1991. Filmmaker Billy Corben, a Miami native and University of Miami alum, will tell the story of how these \u201cBad Boys\u201d of football changed the attitude of the game they played, and how this serene campus was transformed into \u201cThe U.\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iueniOW4gbKeVqp0w5z3ptAevEP.jpg", "actors": ["Dwayne Johnson (Himself - Miami Player (archive footage) (uncredited))", "Billy Corben (himself)", "Luther Campbell (Himself - Hip Hop Artist, 2 Live Crew)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [54731, 54694, 54739, 54684], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
