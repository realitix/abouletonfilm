What does it mean if you are thrown out of your country for singing a song? How does it feel to be condemned for denying the existence of the Holocaust? An Independent Mind explores one of the most important and controversial human rights: freedom of speech.Through testimonies from eight people who have experienced problems as a result of expressing their personal opinions, filmmaker Rex Bloomstein explores the limits of freedom of expression. It is not always easy to to find out where these are. Obviously, it is not difficult to empathise with Reggae singer Tiken Jah Kakoly, who was forced to flee his native Ivory Coast, or with the Algerian cartoonist Ali Dilem, who was condemned to nine years in jail. But does the same apply to Holocaust denier David Irving or the Basque rock group Soziedad Alkoholika that ridicules victims of ETA violence?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e34CNYVxDAjtc24tCO6W2I2LSVf.jpg", "actors": ["Tiken Jah Kakoly (himself)", "Ali Dilem (himself)", "David Irving (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
