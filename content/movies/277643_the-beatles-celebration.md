Most of the interviews come from the post-Beatles era: Pete Best (and Fred Seaman ) speaks of the savage days in Hamburg .There is a lot of unseen photographs although they are sometimes anachronistic : for instance,they are talking about the campaign for peace while showing pictures of Lennon with his second son Sean.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uyD2ki4aVlAjqrHsxa7id2rKXnl.jpg", "actors": ["John Lennon (Himself)", "Paul McCartney (Himself)", "George Harrison (Himself)", "Ringo Starr (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
