It doesn't represent truth as movie claims. Performance is weak and few things are absolutely made up, like Aarseth having girlfriend. He never had girlfriend, he was gay & he didn't even cut his hair (like they showed in movie) according to Varg Vikernes (real). This movie is made by amateur crew who didn't even bother to check real events. If someone is interested in real facts, better read on Wikipedia."}, {"pseudo": "SgtKowalski", "content": "A very well-made thing, in the middle between \u201clad-film\u201d and \u201cpsycho-drama\u201d.\r\n\r\nHowever, there\u2019s a layer missing, and I don\u2019t mean \u201cwhere\u2019s muh black metal soundtrack\u201d or \u201cVarg was right\u201d or \u201cbut there was deep philosophy!!!111\u201d or some such.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean is the following: in the film \u201cGeneration P\u201d (2011), first there\u2019s one moment where the central character eats fly agaric mushrooms in the woods and trips heavily, and then a second moment where he takes acid at home and ancient Sumerian gods start appearing in the walls.\r\n\r\nIf you take these two moments from Generation P, and graft then onto Lords of Chaos\u2014then this would provide an underlying narrative depth behind certain impulses of those involved and the directions taken by them.\r\n\r\nOtherwise it\u2019s like watching a film about Charles Manson, or Jimi Hendrix, or Black Sabbath, or the Ramones, where people only ever drink beer, and you\u2019ve got this nagging feeling that something\u2019s missing, something\u2019s not quite right here\u2026\r\n\r\nThe very notion, that in the beginning of the 1990\u2019s, a new genre with heavy esoteric leanings could explode in Norway and Sweden, without accompanying psychedelic experiences, can\u2019t be taken really seriously in this day and age.\r\n\r\nEven the more \u201ccommercial\u201d bands like Dimmu Borgir and Tiamat no doubt dabbled in this and that. One does not create an esoteric quasi-religion that\u2019s alive and well to this day, evolving even, on beer alone. And this can be also said of early 1990\u2019s Swedish death metal as well. One does not record albums like \u201cLeft Hand\u2019s Path\u201d and \u201cLike an Ever Flowing Stream\u201d on beer alone.\r\n\r\nAll this aside, \u201cLords of Chaos\u201d is as well made as it could be. The director is, after all, a music/advert clip director\u2014just like the director of \u201cGeneration P\u201d for that matter\u2014both directors did their best to use their skills in a new medium, plus stretch the budget, plus get the best possible performance out of enthusiastic B actors.\r\n\r\nIt worked. Keeping in mind how the film was made and on what terms\u2014it works a 100%.\r\nAnd is indeed worth re-watching. \r\nBravo to everyone who made this film the best that it could be!"}], "recommandations_id": [430450, 375909, 478741, 446107], "youtube_key": "M7zrHiqoJ6k"}
