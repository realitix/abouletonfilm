Projected against two walls, \u2018Worry Will Vanish Horizon\u2019 (2014) is a journey inside the human body, based on a three-dimensional animation. Rist delights in patterns created by manipulating creases of skin, caressing, pushing and pulling to depict the varied textures of human flesh. These corporeal images periodically overlap with close-up fragments from nature as Rist blurs the boundaries between the self and organic structures. She explores the relationship between internal and external, how individuals are linked to the tissues and blood vessels of other organisms, and in so doing, she suggests relationships with the universe at large.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6SNq2GmUIyaiYFJxRj0rAKj3ovt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
