Through the flicker of dim projector bulbs and the warble of optical soundtracks a blueprint for better living in the Atomic Age was spelled out in no uncertain terms. Now, just as you remember them, a special collection of rare educational films, ranging in date from the late 1940s to the early 1980s. Some historical, some hysterical and all filled with more important misinformation than you can digest in one viewing. Fantoma presents this specially priced 4-DVD set in a box shaped like a mini school locker.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6qXallCBRNPMOHrH91aW3vP0oFu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
