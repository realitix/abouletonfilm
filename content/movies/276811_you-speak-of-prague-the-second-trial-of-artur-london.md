The documentary explores some of the reasons for the controversy aroused by Costa-Gavras' The Confession,  which had been accused of being anti-communist, and it highlights the political importance of filmmaking which, by its nature, is a fiction intended for the general public.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dgzNADD9EN7wOL9mV6AVxiDojZ3.jpg", "actors": ["Yves Montand (Himself - Interviewee)", "Simone Signoret (Herself - Interviewee)", "Costa-Gavras (Himself - Interviewee)", "Artur London (Himself - Interviewee)", "Jorge Sempr\u00fan (Himself - Interviewee)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
