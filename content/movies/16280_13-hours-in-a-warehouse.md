It was supposed to be a simple night of babysitting a single hostage, but when a series of numbers began to appear on the walls things soon took a dark turn. Later, after the hostage escapes, the perplexed thugs not only learn that there is a rat in the ranks, but also discover the unsettling nature of the films that were shot in the warehouse. Now, as terror takes hold, the thieves are about to discover that they are being stalked from the shadows and that their odds of living to see daybreak are shrinking with each passing minute.Written by Jason Buchanan, All Movie Guide", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ys10cnpIda7rWkOv1al6UvQzhhj.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Cram (Craig Teller)", "Chars Bonin (Randy Hancock)", "Carson Lee (Steve Johnson)", "Cody Lyman (Paul White)", "Daniel Jay Salmen (Mike Hancock (as Danny Salmen))", "Meisha Johnson (Jennifer Wilkins (as Meisha P.J.
