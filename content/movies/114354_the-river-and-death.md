Men, sons, have killed each other for generations, for a so-called conception of honor in a revenge that never ends since it is also triggered by people of the village. Now, today, there are only two sons left, one in each family. One has become a doctor in the big city and his culture is modern. The other last one - of the other family - hasn't left the village and is waiting for the doctor to come \"home\" as he plans to kill him, to settle this war on this matter of honor once and for all. And the people of the village want blood.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/omnrQP1xqpQ5X0DQGCfw2vPWD2b.jpg", "actors": ["Columba Dom\u00ednguez (Mercedes)", "Miguel Torruco (Felipe Anguiano)", "Joaqu\u00edn Cordero (Gerardo Anguiano)", "Jaime Fern\u00e1ndez (Romulo Menchaca)", "V\u00edctor Alcocer (Polo Menchaca)", "Silvia Derbez (Elsa)", "Jos\u00e9 El\u00edas Moreno (Don Nemesio)", "Carlos Mart\u00ednez Baena (Padre Juli\u00e1n)", "Alfredo Varela (Chinelas)", "Miguel Manzano (Don Anselmo)", "Manuel Dond\u00e9 (Z\u00f3simo Anguiano)", "Jorge Arriaga (Filegonio Menchaca)", "Roberto Meyer (Doctor)", "Chel L\u00f3pez (Compadre)", "Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz (Don Honorio)", "Humberto Almaz\u00e1n (Crescencio Menchaca)", "Efra\u00edn Arauz (Amigo de Crescencio (uncredited))", "Fernando Yapur (Amigo de Gerardo (uncredited))", "Guillermo Calles (Tom\u00e1s (uncredited))", "Lupe Carriles (T\u00eda de Mercedes (uncredited))", "Enrique Carrillo (Militar (uncredited))", "Aurora Cort\u00e9s (Comadre (uncredited))", "Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda  (Tumbao (uncredited))", "Emilio Garibay (Cu\u00f1ado de Filegonio (uncredited))", "Amparo Garrido (Novia de Romulo (uncredited))", "Cecilia Leger (Pueblerina (uncredited))", "In\u00e9s Murillo (Pueblerina (uncredited))", "Salvador God\u00ednez (Pueblerino (uncredited))", "Manuel Noriega (Pueblerino (uncredited))", "Antonio Padilla 'P\u00edcoro' (Pueblerino (uncredited))", "Ignacio Pe\u00f3n (Pueblerino (uncredited))", "Polo Ramos (Pueblerino (uncredited))", "Georgina Gonz\u00e1lez (Enfermera (uncredited))", "Leonor G\u00f3mez (Sirvienta (uncredited))", "Enedina D\u00edaz de Le\u00f3n (Do\u00f1a Eulalia (uncredited))", "Ana Mar\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez (Do\u00f1a Joaquinita (uncredited))", "Diana Ochoa (Do\u00f1a Lupe (uncredited))", "Aurora Ruiz (Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda (uncredited))", "Francisco Ledesma (Tendero (uncredited))", "\u00c1lvaro Matute (Joaqu\u00edn (uncredited))", "Nemorio Mej\u00eda (Jugador de billar (uncredited))", "Alberto Pedret (Primo de Gerardo (uncredited))", "Jos\u00e9 Pidal (M\u00e9dico (uncredited))", "Salvador Terroba (Hermano de Joaqu\u00edn (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [44804, 118003], "youtube_key": "P5550SYIM2Q"}
