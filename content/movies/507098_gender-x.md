{"tmdb_id": 507098, "title": "Gender X", "original_title": "Gender X", "slug_title": "gender-x", "date": "2005-02-12", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "A city always known as a magnet for alternate lifestyles, Berlin has been attracting people of different and interesting 'genders' since the 19th Century. Director Julia Ostertag, camera in hand, takes us through a tour of unusual (and some not) clubs throughout the city during a period of a few months. We encounter known personalities, drag queens and other night creatures, all a tad peculiar. Sexuality without borders, and breaking taboos are the main themes addressed. The documentary, above all, questions the concept of 'normalcy' and the many prejudices established by society as a whole, and the different segments of society shown on film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ssOmnWCHuALAUVVywKV3B988y34.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
