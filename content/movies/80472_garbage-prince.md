He ends up by happenstance in a small eastern town in Finland where he soon comes face to face with the daily rigors of independent life. Coping becomes a challenge for him almost to the point of being an obsession.  Of all the people in town, Jed seems to constantly run across the prickly and quick-witted Lulu (17). Gradually, without either of them admitting it, their relationship changes from bickering, picking on each other and a battle of wills to friendship, and as can happen, finally to love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tsX6QIJ3uCB2sQHOSXtC2WwX8Vr.jpg", "actors": ["Joonas Makkonen (K\u00f6rri's banger)", "Pihla Maalismaa (Lulu)", "Risto Salmi (Iso-Antti)", "Kari Heiskanen (Juhani Pohjakallio)", "Antti Virmavirta (Markku Laakso)", "Heikki Silvennoinen (Saastamoinen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "pcAAj1iib-4"}
