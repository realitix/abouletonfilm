Children become adults, which is a cause worth celebrating. The young Kai lives with his father on a farm. They have invited guests for the festive meal planned for the following day. Everything has been arranged and the calf is ready for slaughter. But Kai's father does not want to slaughter or celebrate, he wants his peace. Driven by the fear that everything could go wrong, Kai races through the sleepy village. The afternoon leads him to Lea, a local girl. With her, time takes on a different pace. KAI captures a formative moment in life, where a boy tries to find a way out. From a village, from a family situation and from his own anxieties.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aPeDT3VcMf2XQjXg0oh3gbGCzMV.jpg", "actors": ["Sammy Scheuritzel (Kai)", "Stefan Kolosko (Lothar)", "Antonio Wannek (Steffen)", "Dalina Schambach (Lea)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
