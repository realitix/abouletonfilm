With an original score, it tells the fictional story of DJ Huey Calhoun, a good ole' local boy with a passion for R&amp;B music and Felicia Farrell, an up-and-coming black singer that he meets one fateful night on Beale Street. Despite the objections of their loved ones (Huey's close-minded mama and Felicia's cautious brother, a club owner), they embark on a dangerous affair. As their careers rise, the relationship is challenged by personal ambition and the pressures of an outside world unable to accept their love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2bzS6mX3TyAayuRb1dxXyp9Qq3e.jpg", "actors": ["Chad Kimball (Huey Calhoun)", "Montego Glover (Felicia Farrell)", "J.
