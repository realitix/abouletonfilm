The alleged disease is caused by the relentless heat that hits the city. Under the marginal eyes of Guima, in a mix of reality and fantasy, the film presents a tropical/chaotic Salvador, as opposed to the stereotypical city seen in postcards, on a journey of a search for a redemptive air conditioning that can rid this contemporary antihero of what suffocates his existence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tUTQNv2OxPcNNvz7Q5gMbkK4ZPu.jpg", "actors": ["Gabriel Pardal (Guima)", "Manu Santiago (Sara)", "Fabr\u00edcio Boliveira (Josu\u00e9)", "Dellani Lima (John)", "Joana Schnitman (Guiomar)", "S\u00e9rgio Farias (Jurandir)", "Katia Leal (Tia Dolores)", "Edgard Navarro (Tropikos)", "Bertrand Duarte (Kaos)", "A\u00edcha Marques (Roseana)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
