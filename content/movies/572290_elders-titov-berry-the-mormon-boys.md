They have little name badges on their chests: \u201cElder Titov\u201d is dark-haired and confident, while \u201cElder Berry\u201d is lighter and tentative. Jared has heard of Mormons before \u2013 with their \u201cmagic underwear\u201d and their secret rituals \u2013 but he is surprised that two such young men, no more than 18 or 19, would call themselves \u201cElders\u201d and try to convert him. He knows his master will love these two strikingly beautiful, innocent boys, so he invites them to visit his house the next day. His master is extremely pleased and immediately plans a series of ingenious tortures.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6hjrqcIhgtyTsxpsUxCpN8pWadM.jpg", "actors": ["Elder Titov ()", "Elder Berry ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
