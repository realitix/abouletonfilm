They make a splash at Steve Strange's trendy Blitz Club where George gets a job in the cloakroom but George is unlucky in his relationships with men until he meets wannabe musician Kirk. Through Kirk George meets the handsome drummer Jon Moss, on whom he develops a crush, but sacked by the Blitz and spurned by Kirk, George turns to Sex Pistols' manager Malcolm McLaren to further his music career. George's spell with McLaren's group Bow Wow Wow is short but fan Mikey North is impressed and asks George to sing in a group he is forming, where George again meets Jon. They will have an affair and the group will become the very successful Culture Club. Four years later, however, hounded by the tabloid press amid stories of his drug addiction, an unhappy George turns to Jon for advice on his future.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6Ki21kePUIZ39tAsicSzB7eZhLf.jpg", "actors": ["Douglas Booth (Boy George)", "Mathew Horne (Jon Moss)", "Francis Magee (Jerry O'Dowd)", "Richard Madden (Kirk Brandon)", "Freddie Fox (Marilyn)", "Marc Warren (Steve Strange)", "Mark Gatiss (Malcolm McLaren)", "Jonny Burt (Roy Hay)", "Dean Fagan (Mikey Craig)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [66617], "youtube_key": "zkYrMRWcj8Q"}
