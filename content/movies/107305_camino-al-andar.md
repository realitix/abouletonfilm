Learning, real understanding, war, poverty, mass media, and what the future has in store for us. These are some of the issues she reflects upon with the experienced help in the form of insights provided by: philosophers (Rafael Argullol), doctors (Sir John Woodhall), writers (Amin Maalouf), musicians (Trilok Gurtu), professors (Ram\u00f3n Tamames, Federico Mayor Zaragoza), social workers (Bani Dugal, Linda Kavelin-Popov, Gustavo Correa, Alberto P\u00e9rez), promoters of new economic systems (Muhammad Yunus, Jean Ziegler). She finally arrives at the conclusion that \"the future, contrary to certain theories, does not write itself. We write the future.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oHFSop98HRpmdOW3dGqAktNxPI8.jpg", "actors": ["Amin Andresco (Cosmonaut)", "Sarah Nur Andresco (Walker)", "Rafael Argullol ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "K2H5L_4gHtM"}
