Interviewing an increasingly mentally unstable Wuornos, Broomfield captures the distorted mind of a murderer whom the state of Florida deems of sound mind -- and therefore fit to execute. Throughout the film, Broomfield includes footage of his testimony at Wuornos' trial.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6xK0WqH2fxGHXFFqOV0M96oTNC7.jpg", "actors": ["Aileen Wuornos (herself)", "Nick Broomfield (Himself)", "Diane Wuornos (Aileen's mother)", "Terry Humphreys-Slay (Aileen's father)", "Arlene Pralle (Aileen's adoptive mother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [97044, 85521, 212508, 97030], "youtube_key": "rExhihAZGxg"}
