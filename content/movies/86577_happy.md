It explores human happiness through interviews with people from all walks of life in 14 different countries, weaving in the newest findings of positive psychology. Director Roko Belic was originally inspired to create the film after producer/director Tom Shadyac (Liar, Liar, Patch Adams, Bruce Almighty) showed him an article in the New York Times entitled \"A New Measure of Well Being From a Happy Little Kingdom\". The article ranks the United States as the 23rd happiest country in the world. Shadyac then suggested that Belic make a documentary about happiness. Belic spent several years interviewing over 20 people, ranging from leading happiness researchers to a rickshaw driver in Kolkatta, a family living in a \"co-housing community\" in Denmark, a woman who was run over by a truck, a Cajun fisherman, and more.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wAz3VHk0nyeottwGc3lOFHi3Hky.jpg", "actors": ["Gregory Berns (himself)", "Roy Blanchard (himself)", "Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (himself)", "Tenzin Gyatso (himself)", "Richard Davison (himself)", "Ed Diener (himself)", "Daniel Gilbert (himself)", "Tim Kasser (himself)", "Sonja Lyubomirsky (herself)", "Nic Marks (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [382751, 19572, 92662, 463845], "youtube_key": "JcMQmuvzPmI"}
