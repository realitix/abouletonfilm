When a stranger approaches him outside the gym with the offer of a specially produced steroid, Stanley is drawn into the ever more violent operations of a powerful organisation, unwittingly entering into a series of tests designed to prove his mettle. This is a film about power, determination and being your own worst enemy. It celebrates the archetypes of classic Film Noir, and the dark, conspiratorial storytelling technique of Franz Kafka, but with a contemporary minimalist aesthetic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m8V5lwi9l7fFlDtPPwfUDK9SYks.jpg", "actors": ["Jye Frasca (Stanley)", "Tor Andreas Fagerland (Kaufman)", "Amy Pemberton (The Girl)", "Ruperth Shelbourne (Jaeger)", "Toby Osmond (Fader)", "Jonny Lessani (The Assistant)", "Jo Diamond (The Driver)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "A6O2xEaWwwI"}
