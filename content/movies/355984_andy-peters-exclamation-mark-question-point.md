More bootleg than traditional special, Andy recorded only one show, one night at The Virgil in Los Angeles. The special features a bouncy mix of Andy's dive-in-head-first approach to comedy. With The Virgil's intimate space as a backdrop, Andy litters the show with playful self-deprecating bits, a healthy dose of \"screaming at strangers\" and a nonstop stream of riffs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lfoM58DYYAbn1gFhiAFtiCge5DI.jpg", "actors": ["Andy Peters (Himself)", "Eddie Pepitone (Himself)", "Karen Kilgariff (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
