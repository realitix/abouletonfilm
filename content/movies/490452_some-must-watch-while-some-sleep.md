Photographed on Super 8mm and using hand-processed film techniques to create an unworldly zone between sleep and wakefulness, it looks at three characters and the film\u2019s material that connects them.  It is a film that invites the viewer to sleep with the film\u2019s protagonists, to drift across into the dream world of the film\u2019s material and lose touch with their current surroundings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/doihoVkLM6QSFuoCThvNgU445L5.jpg", "actors": ["Conor Higgins ()", "Keeley Milne ()", "Janine Williams ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
