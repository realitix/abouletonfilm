There\u2019s some wince inducing moments, even times when the picture dares you to contemplate how you would react in similar circumstances. Yet it all feels so lazy and cheap, with some poor acting and cringe worthy dialogue dragging the piece down still further. A twist in the tail works well, but by then you may feel jaded to the point of not caring. 5/10"}], "recommandations_id": [207774, 101179, 132064, 244610]}
