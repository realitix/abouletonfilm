Kim Coates and Claude Duhamel are on hand as his gang members.\r\n\r\nAdkins makes for an iconic Westerner, as witnessed in \u201cTraded\u201d (2016) and \u201cHickok\u201d (2017). The difference between \u201cStagecoach: The Texas Jack Story\u201d and those two is (1.) Adkins plays the main protagonist and (2.) it\u2019s noticeably inferior in overall filmmaking, even though it cost approximately the same amount to make. In other words, as low-budget as \u201cTraded\u201d and \u201cHickok\u201d were, they worked quite well as made-for-TV (or direct-to-video) Westerns, all things considered. \u201cStagecoach: The Texas Jack Story\u201d is almost amateurish by comparison.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it has some points of interest for those who don\u2019t mind slipshod productions: Adkins is a likable protagonist; the one-eyed marshal was the dope-smoking rebel in \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d (1985); Michelle Harrison is stunning as the protagonist\u2019s redheaded wife, Laura Lee; Helena Marie plays Bonnie, a striking tall blonde deputy with a penchant for killing; the British Columbia locations are effective; and there\u2019s a quality moral about not trusting people of dubious character, particularly LIARS.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 30 minutes and was shot in British Columbia (Mission and Maple Ridge). WRITERS: Dan Benamor and Matt Williams.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C/C-"}], "recommandations_id": [433018, 470614, 470616, 492684]}
