Cliff's fianc\u00e9e, Janet Meade, is a reporter doing a story about Reyes. Reyes orders Cliff to kill Marcelo Villalba, who is running for his countries position as president, but Cliff can't bring himself to do it, because his assignment from the DEA is to work against Reyes. Reyes is afraid Villalba will put him out of business, and is afraid that Janet's story will do the same thing, so Reyes sends someone else after Villalba, and then Reyes has Janet kidnapped, and Cliff is the only one who can keep Reyes' plans from succeeding", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o1t0OqpTikW4d9ivc9spe1IUiqk.jpg", "actors": ["John Schneider (Cliff Adams)", "Kathryn Witt (Janet Meade)", "Royal Dano (Bailey)", "Federico Luppi (Gonzalo Reyes)", "Rodolfo Ranni (Gen.
