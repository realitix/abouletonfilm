One day in the market Vera Andreyevna runs into an untidy and half-drunk old man whom she recognizes with difficulty. It is Alyosha, who was in the same orphanage with her and who had been her first love. Reminiscences overwhelm them and stir their hearts. Alexei Ivanovich, who had lived a far from easy life, undergoes an amazing change. He begins to look younger and more orderly. Vera Andreyevna feels she is a woman again, a woman who has to make her choice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ah4lprynOF1aN0Zu3G1lHILNdb1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
