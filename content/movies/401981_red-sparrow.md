It's not her best apparition but she's the main character of the plot, so you can appreciate her like in no other of her movies.\r\n\r\nTwisted and complex, the main plot is defined by itself during the development of the movie.\r\n\r\nBy synopsis, Dominika Egorova (Jennifer Lawrence) it's a professional ballet ballerina that tragically forced to change her career path by an \"accident\".\r\n\r\nMoved by her family needs, she's accept some \"business\" propositions that subsequent convert her into an Sparrow, a secret government physiologic weapon of seduction.\r\n\r\nBy personal opinion you can feel this movie very slow because of the absent of a good sound work. The image of this movie was perfect for an excellent sound editing and mixing, so the absent of this take some points in the final score in public perception."}, {"pseudo": "cabji", "content": "It's one of those movies where you know what's going to happen in the end but you aren't sure how it's going to happen.
