Paul has just moved into an apartment with his pragmatic girlfriend, Jen, and is struggling to complete his dissertation before embarking on a career in academia. There's just one snag: as Paul is unpacking his belongings, he discovers that something has been left behind. A seemingly inconsequential object, but one Paul feels is of great importance to his dissertation and, therefore, to his future: a battered, personally annotated hardcover copy of 'Little Dorrit' by Charles Dickens. He will have to retrieve it from his former roommate - the obstinate Nancy. As he becomes increasingly consumed with the retrieval of 'Little Dorrit', Paul's relationship and career unravel.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5K83tYARUXBgzAhfgmyWjFbMRrQ.jpg", "actors": ["Will Rogers (Paul)", "El\u00e9onore Hendricks (Nancy)", "Rebecca Lawrence Levy (Jen (as Rebecca Lawrence))", "Santino Fontana (Charlie)", "Novella Nelson (Dr. Bannister)", "Wally Dunn (Sergeant Pehoski)", "Timothy Chastain (Russ)", "Eilis Cahill (Amy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [455401], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
