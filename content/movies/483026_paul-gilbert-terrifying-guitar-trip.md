Including the usual amount of highly useful exercises for the practicing guitarist (and truly frightening displays of Gilbert's over-the-top technique), it's also loaded with Gilbert's goofy sense of humor, which makes the video a treat to watch even for non-musicians. Gilbert also offers tips on more \"big-picture\" topics like working with managers and producers. Plenty of entertaining live and in-the-studio footage of Gilbert with his band, Mr. Big, are intercut with the lessons as well, making this video a must for Gilbert's fans, be they guitarists or not.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uVzHLqAWc6vIoCxPMydLOAwu0VZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
