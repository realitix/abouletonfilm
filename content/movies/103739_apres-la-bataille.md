Mahmoud is close to despair when he meets Reem, a divorcee and modern-thinker who works in advertising. Reem is a fervent ecologist who first comes to Mahmoud\u2019s rundown neighbourhood to care for the camels and horses that have been left to fend for themselves. Their encounter develops into a love story that will radically change the course of their lives forever.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b05o2Y21bMqt8EGa7WgGn1ZfxaG.jpg", "actors": ["Menna Shalabi (Reem)", "Basim Samra (Mahmoud)", "Nahed El Sebai (Fatma)", "Salah Abdallah (Haj Abdallah)", "Phaedra Al-Masri (Dina)", "Abdallah Medhat (Abdallah)", "Momen Medhat (Momen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
