The second episode is the most notorious and, consequently, gave the film its controversial poster \u2013 featuring a rabbit slowly disappearing under the skirt of a teenage girl (played by Gaelle Legrand). The third and final episode, which has a modern-day setting, is the shortest \u2013 but also, possibly, the most outrageous: Pascale Christophe is a young married woman who\u2019s abducted on a busy Parisian street by a small-time hood hidden inside a cardboard box!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hQsHn4mXBQOQNsxq4oIQszyp4bZ.jpg", "actors": ["Marina Pierro (Margherita Luti)", "Ga\u00eblle Legrand (Marceline Cain)", "Pascale Christophe (Marie)", "Fran\u00e7ois Gu\u00e9tary (Raphael Sanzio)", "Jean-Claude Dreyfus (Bini)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [90702, 160457, 29333, 2304], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
