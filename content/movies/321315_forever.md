Costas and Anna in Athens. Costas is an engine driver. The trains he drives travel from one end of the city to the other, following the traces of the ancient rivers that were paved over and made into roads. Anna sells ferry boat tickets at Piraeus, the city\u2019s main harbour, the place where the rivers once flowed into the sea. Costas knows Anna. He sees her every morning, waiting on the platform for his train to take her from Thiseion to Piraeus; and he sees her every afternoon, when his train takes her from Piraeus back to Thiseion. Anna doesn\u2019t know Costas. From the window of the train car she looks out at the same desolate city every day, without knowing who\u2019s driving the train. When something happens to turn Costas\u2019s life upside down, he decides to reach out from inside his solitude and talk to Anna.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mbOPWkwyr3wU6QWjg6WsvXQSQar.jpg", "actors": ["Kostas Filippoglou (Kostas)", "Anna Mascha (Anna)", "Nikos Dallas ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
