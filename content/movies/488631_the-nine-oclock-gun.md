The film presents one firing of Vancouver's famous gun; an event that attracts an audience visible on screen unlike the audience watching the film; ourselves. Our experience of time in our innermost self is unlike our experience of space or mass yet nothing in physics corresponds to the passage of time. How can something we experience as so real be based on an illusion. Norfolk, Virginia also has a Nine O'clock Gun.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/usztd0EexJZdbMMGtjcRorqmQZv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
