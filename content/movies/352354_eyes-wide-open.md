Almost 40 years later, filmmaker Gonzalo Arijon\r reevaluates the situation. His search takes him from the soybean\r plantations of the Brazilian Amazon to the tin mines of Bolivia to the\r deep jungles of Ecuador. Arijon\u2019s politically committed film allows\r the local populations to speak for themselves, interspersing this with\r archival footage of speeches by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Lula da Silva and Evo\r Morales. Galeano himself also speaks\u2014sometimes in poetic language\u2014\r about how the rise of socialist governments in the early 21st century is\r benefitting Latin America, and what more can be done.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/966bdPgJ18b59MllnDeM85UkKBF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
