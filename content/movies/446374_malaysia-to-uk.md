There was no plan, no script, no backup crew and no-one to tell him what a stupid idea it was.  Over the next 8 months, Ed and his trusty motorbike Ninety travelled through 17 countries, including Malaysia, Thailand, India and Iran. In Vietnam he got very drunk with a little old lady and in Bangkok there were wedding bells.  Where will he sleep tonight? What happens when you bribe a Cambodian army weapons store with \u00a3200? Can you get to Everest Base Camp in a pair of trainers? These are all questions that Ed March didn\u2019t even know needed answering.  Join Ed as he shows you what the world is really like when you have a big smile, a small bike and an even smaller budget.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2GKDO0GKgkWx7lyRRpeHvMYdI43.jpg", "actors": ["Ed March (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
