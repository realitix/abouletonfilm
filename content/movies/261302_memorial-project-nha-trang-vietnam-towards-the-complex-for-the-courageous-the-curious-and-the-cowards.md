Working in teams, they pull, push, and pedal the passengerless vehicles; and periodically they must rush up to the surface for air or risk drowning. The water grows deeper; the boulders get larger; the trip to the surface takes longer; and the task is increasingly arduous. Finally, the drivers abandon their cyclos, and swim together toward an underwater \u201ccity\u201d composed of tents made from white netting strung between boulders, a metaphorical memorial for the many Vietnamese boat people drowned in the aftermath of the war.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rw7weZ7OQHxh84gWP1wk4ya04q.jpg", "actors": ["Ho Van Luan ()", "Nguyen Ut ()", "Nguen Thanh Tu ()", "Truong Van Truc ()", "Vo Khac Huy ()", "Vo Van Cuong ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
