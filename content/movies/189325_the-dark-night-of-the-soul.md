Juan Diego stars as San Juan de la Cruz (St. John of the Cross), the legendary 16th-century poet-prophet. Galvanized into action by the spirit of Santa Teresa de Jesus, San Juan fought to install reforms in the Carmelite Order. Like many another visionary, he was regarded as a heretic, and promptly subjected to the most appalling of tortures. Writer-director Saura manages to draw several parallels between the religious persecution of the 1700s and the political despotism of Fascist Spain.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qvoDm96KLEpeWDPNrOQu0PvARY4.jpg", "actors": ["Juan Diego ()", "Julie Delpy ()", "Fernando Guill\u00e9n ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
