She's unhappy because the lord's daughters treat her like their servant. The country is in problems, because the prince is a dreamer and doesn't realize that his chancellor abuses his power. When the day nears the prince is forced by law to find a wife, a celebration on a frozen lake is arranged. Ella manages to skate on the lake for him too, hiding her identity.
