It depicts the efforts of three classically-trained opera artists to keep alive their revered art form for the generation of young Chinese-Americans who would otherwise not be exposed to their tradition.In the time-worn pattern of immigrant life, they spend their days grinding out a living. In their spare time each performs and teaches Chinese opera. Scenes from the classic work Monkey King Looks West stand as a metaphor for cultural survival.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
