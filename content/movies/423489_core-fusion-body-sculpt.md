Now you can get the same results at home with workouts from Core Fusion creators Fred DeVito and Elisabeth Halfpapp. Body Sculpt tones and sculpts your deepest, most hard-to-reach muscles so it's more efficient and effective than traditional strength training. Using your own body weight as resistance, five 10-minute workouts build a strong core, develop washboard abs, give you better posture, and shape a tighter, firmer backside. To make the most of this program, you'll need small hand weights", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8IcDhPT75aNKrxDtsKB6C1mmQ3G.jpg", "actors": ["Elisabeth Halfpapp ()", "Fred DeVito ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
