Susan Boyle entered the talent show looking like something that wouldn't really get anywhere, but then she shocked everyone all over the world, achieving extraordinary press for her video on YouTube, and even though she didn't win the competition she instantly got signed to a record label, with the help of Simon Cowell, and the rest writes itself, platinum single with \"I Dreamed A Dream\" and three UK number one albums. Anyway, this documentary gives us an insight into what her life is like two years on, including still living in her parent's old house, making guest appearances, visiting Cowell, recording tracks, and much more, it was interesting.
