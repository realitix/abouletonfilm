If you've got some cash and you need a car, D-Stacks (White) can hook you up with one of the hottest rides around. His crew may be a little crazy, but they won't be happy until the customer leaves satisfied. Their latest customer is Boogie White, a local hot-shot who just mistakenly left $10,000 in the trunk of his rented car. When the money goes missing, it falls on D-Stacks to make sure it's replaced. Now, if D-Stacks can just convince one of his talented employees to turn out a hit single and stage a local show, maybe they can raise enough money to pay Boogie back. But they've only got 72 hours to make it happen, and should they fail D-Stacks stands to lose more than just his reputation as a reliable businessman. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9r0rHf42TL2D1AAaDZlMOGPhV5w.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
