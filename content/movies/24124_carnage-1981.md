At best, the movie might be as good as some of the \u201cFriday\u201d sequels, although the girls are subpar by comparison, albeit okay. Nonetheless, \u201cBurning\u201d has its points of interest, like Brian Backer from \u201cFast Times at Ridgemont High\u201d and, especially, a young Jason Alexander from Seinfeld with a full-head of hair. Production-wise, it\u2019s low-budget but superior to, say, \u201cSleepaway Camp.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe film was shot in and around existing summer camps outside Buffalo in Western New York, as well as North Tonawanda.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"}], "recommandations_id": [27475, 47957, 13567, 44247]}
