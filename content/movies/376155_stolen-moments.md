An abandoned house on the beach shelters Letty's dreams, her loneliness that only Miguel, a very young pianist, may share with her. Tomas, her husband, loves Letty and eagerly defends her against all the village, while she keeps playing her part of a 'femme fatale' with a romantic past and a very adventurous file. But on a windy day, a handsome and strange foreigner appears, coming from the sea, a man just as those Bette Davis used to fall in love with. For Letty, reality begins to look like the most incredible dreams of her. But this will call the police inspector's attention. With that mysterious spy, Letty will be involved in a story that will end as those stories she was so fond of when she was going to the movie theater of her little willage.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Pepe Soriano ()", "Betiana Blum ()", "Roberto Carnaghi ()", "Rita Cortese ()", "Oscar Barney Finn ()", "Fran\u00e7ois-Eric Gendron ()", "Mart\u00edn Karpan ()", "Arturo Maly ()", "Jorge Rivera L\u00f3pez ()", "Assumpta Serna ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
