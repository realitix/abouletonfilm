Untouched by humans for over half a century, DMZ\u2019s nature would be close to how this land would look when the civilization disappears. Nature and wilderness breathe here freely, and endangered species have made the place their habitat. With the narration of actor Lee Min-ho, the documentary reveals the beauty of Korea\u2019s nature in its rawest and purest form.  Here, there is a silent land where humans stepped down. It is a military demarcation line between North and South. It is the foremost front that consumed two-thirds of the 37-month Korean War, and the DMZ, a military operation area that has not been available for more than 60 years since the armistice. It is the largest temperate primeval forest on Earth, where human history of heartbreak and the wild survival of wild animals coexist.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kfy9tlNCrKf1LmZ9wjnv3Rik7iv.jpg", "actors": ["Lee Min-ho (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
