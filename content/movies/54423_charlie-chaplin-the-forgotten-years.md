In addition to his penchant for much younger women, Chaplin was unjustly hounded by Senator Joe McCarthy's notorious anti-Communist witch hunts, for which the U.S. revoked his visa in 1952. A bitter and disenchanted Chaplin responded by moving his family to Switzerland, where he remained until his death in 1977. This documentary chronicles Chaplin's life and career during those so-called \"forgotten years\" (during which he became a prolific and highly respected film-score composer) through previously unreleased archival footage and intimate interviews with his friends and family, including his children Geraldine, Michael, and Eugene.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mubJWHL3GlLSnKCxZaDpF1yY3Q5.jpg", "actors": ["Eugene Chaplin (Himself)", "Geraldine Chaplin (Herself)", "Michael Chaplin (Himself)", "Petula Clark (Herself)", "Arthur Cohn (Himself)", "Sophia Loren (Herself)", "Peter Ustinov (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
