It is as though vast swathes of the universe are being hoovered up by a vast and unseen celestial vacuum cleaner. Sasha Kaslinsky, the scientist who discovered the phenomenon, is understandably nervous: \u2018It left us quite unsettled and jittery\u2019 he says, \u2018because this is not something we planned to find\u2019. The accidental discovery of what is ominously being called \u2018dark flow\u2019 not only has implications for the destinies of large numbers of galaxies \u2013 it also means that large numbers of scientists might have to find a new way of understanding the universe. Dark flow is the latest in a long line of phenomena that have threatened to re-write the textbooks. Does it herald a new era of understanding, or does it simply mean that everything we know about the universe is wrong? .", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kLe7lVX2crTF09K7loMjZYvlKh8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
