Recycling elements of surrealism and cubism, this animated short by Theodore Ushev focuses on the relationship between art and war. Propelled by the exalting \u201cinvasion\u201d theme from Shostakovich\u2019s Leningrad Symphony (No. 7), the film presents imagery of combat fronts and massacres, leading us from Dresden to Guernica, from the Spanish Civil War to Star Wars. It is at once a symphony that serves the war machine, that stirs the masses, and art that mourns the dead, voices its outrage and calls for peace.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fonHObQnL2aeN6CTWBNTSZYlDxz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
