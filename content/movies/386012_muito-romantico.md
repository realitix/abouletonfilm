It takes them from Brazil to Berlin, a city of perpetual movement, where the old constantly has to give space to the new. The couple finds a home and transforms it into the center of their own universe. As time passes and seasons change, life and cinema become interchangeable and their apartment evolves into an ever-changing stage, where friends are invited to play their own roles and reality and fiction merge. Until one day a cosmic portal appears in their home, opening connections between the past, the present and the future.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1c3SwtJcsN93KbPR37SF3rt9reJ.jpg", "actors": ["Melissa Dullius (Herself)", "Gustavo Jahn (Himself)", "Gustavo Beck ()", "Kana Chiaki ()", "Aqico Coco ()", "Friederike Frerichs ()", "Erik Haegert ()", "Imogen Heath ()", "Lilja L\u00f6ffler ()", "Steve Nietz ()", "Yuki Mori ()", "Deborah S.
