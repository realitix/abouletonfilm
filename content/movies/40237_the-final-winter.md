Set in Sydney in the 1980s the movie is a drama about the effects upon the players, supporters and the game itself as the sport grows from being the semi-pro suburban game it's been for nearly 100 years into a fully professional international sport. Superbly written and acted by Matt Nable, a former football player along with other former players mixed in with some internationally recognised actors, the story is a realistic snapshot into the lives of people for whom the game is a weekend escape from their otherwise ordinary lives. That's all about to change as big business realises the potential the game holds leaving those clinging to the old ways in their wake.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y7m6kSz9AV0vrK2aPnkVV2fD2xk.jpg", "actors": ["Matthew Nable (Grub)", "Nathaniel Dean (Trent)", "Matthew Johns (Jack)", "Raelee Hill (Emma)", "Michelle Langstone (Mia)", "Kate Mulvany (Kate)", "Conrad Coleby (Billy)", "John Jarratt (Colgate)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "PqnH1VGTUdE"}
