Opposing them is Henry Waterman, publisher of the Rio Blanco Herald. He and his assistant, Andrew Jackson Weems, send for the help of the Territorial Rangers. One of the dispatched Rangers is Jeff Lanning who, unknown to him, has a brother as a member of the gang under an assumed name of Bob Mitchell. Jeff is so shocked at seeing his brother gun down Waterman that he is unable to act in time to prevent it. Unable to explain the cause of is inaction, he is suspended by the governor. Unable to persuade his brother to quit the gang, Jeff, with the aid of Weems and Waterman's daughter Carol, begins his quest to bring the outlaws to justice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bExmkEo8BE6c9tSXHGFAY7TvkY4.jpg", "actors": ["Monte Hale (Jeff Lanning)", "Kay Christopher (Carol Waterman)", "Paul Hurst (Andy Weems)", "Roy Barcroft (Lon Bryson)", "Douglas Kennedy (Henchman Bob Mitchell)", "Don Haggerty (Chuck Bowers)", "Rory Mallinson (Captain Dan Brennan)", "Lane Bradford (Henchman Tex)", "Emmett Vogan (Henry Waterman)", "Myron Healey (Marshal Travis)", "Tom London (Jim Weston)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
