The show was filmed and edited for later broadcast in Europe and Japan as promotion for his then-forthcoming 1986 Parade tour, which hit eight countries in less than a month.  The Parade tour never officially hit the United States, with Prince deciding to test the show out on audiences in a handful of cities across the country before taking it abroad. Fortunately, videotapes of the Detroit show have been circulating amongst hardcore Prince collectors for years and have found their way onto the internet so you can witness what was arguably Prince\u2019s funkiest tour to date.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1XZY2XvQSNiXepTsvPWQ3KmFfbV.jpg", "actors": ["Prince ()", "Wendy Melvoin ()", "Lisa Coleman ()", "Dr. Fink ()", "Brown Mark ()", "Bobby Z ()", "Sheila E.
