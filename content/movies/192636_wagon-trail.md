Sheriff Hartley suspects him, but has been unable to gather the needed evidence. Collins instructs his gang, including young Hartley, to hold up the stagecoach on its return trip from Missionary Flats and take the cargo of gold dust it is carrying. Sheriff Hartley is notified of the planned holdup by one of his deputies who has been spying on Collins, and organizes a posse. A deputy-sheriff is killed in the ensuing gunfight between the lawmen and the outlaws, but Deputy Joe Larkin, pursues and captures Clay Hartley Jr. The latter is quickly tried and convicted of the killing of the deputy, and sentenced to be hung. Sheriff Hartley has only a few hours to prove his son was not the killer. He enlists the aid of Collins' step-daughter, Joan, who is in love with Hartley's son.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r6a1Mr0LVtDUgJm7vEyM9aDOnqj.jpg", "actors": ["Harry Carey (Sheriff Clay Hartley)", "Gertrude Messinger (Joan Collins)", "Edward Norris (Clay Hartley, Jr.)", "Roger Williams (Mark Collins)", "Earl Dwire (Deputy Joe Larkin)", "Chuck Morrison (Deputy Chuck)", "John Elliott (Judge)", "Chief Thundercloud (Henchman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
