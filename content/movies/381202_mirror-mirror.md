Offering an uncompromisingly candid look, docu demystifies such relevant issues as gender, sex and daily survival as they pertain to a \u201cdeviant\u201d minority that\u2019s often misunderstood and misrepresented in the media. Though laced with humor, overall downbeat tone, along with a gruesome onscreen operation of breast removal, might restrict theatrical potential, but docu should be shown in festivals and other venues open to challenging nonfiction fare.\r\n\r\nBorn in l958, as Floyd William Bradford, Consuela Cosmetic was a fair-skinned black male who devoted virtually his entire lifetime to altering his physical appearance through female hormone therapy, silicone injection, plastic surgery \u2014 and whatever else it took to create the credible illusion of a female. But Consuela never took the crucial final step of gender-changing surgery; for most of his life, he functioned as a person with both breasts and penis. In fact, advertising his unique attributes, he managed to make a decent living as a nightclub performer and an aggressive hustler; many men were reportedly intrigued by his peculiar combination of biological traits.\r\n\r\nAmong docu\u2019s most harrowing sequences are Consuela\u2019s comments on how AIDS has not only ravaged his peers, but also destroyed the notion of self-worth and other values associated with transsexualism. The central figure comes across as a sensitive and witty person whose chief concern was to live with dignity and at peace with himself.\r\n\r\nHelmer Walsh, who has directed some impressive musicvideos, keeps his subject on a tight rein, never letting him digress from his focused concern, even when the remarks are entertaining in their own right. Consuela\u2019s contributions while at his best \u2014 and worst \u2014 add considerable energy and humor to the film\u2019s intimate, often moving portrait. In large sections, Consuela, too weak to walk around, is seen lying in his bed.\r\n\r\n\u201cMirror, Mirror\u201d doesn\u2019t provide the light, entertaining look at drag queens and transsexuals that prevails in such movies as \u201cThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\u201d and \u201cTo Wong Foo,\u201d but it\u2019s far more substantial, and often quite illuminating, in its observations about the day-to-day reality of a minority still misperceived by mainstream society."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "7sbN_qH2imc"}
