He imagines what might occur if Shih-T\u2019ao\u2019s six poetic procedures for attaining the primal respiration or cosmic breath in painting were applied to one of the flagships of Western art, Velazquez\u2019s Las Meninas.  Ruiz wants the three cultures to interact and test each other like the paper, stone and scissors of the children\u2019s game. The result is an insoluble dispute, a diff\u00e9rend. No reconciliation or compromise is possible between these cultural outlooks.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sjTR1pSYtwG63r3rtLjZjkU6EQr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
