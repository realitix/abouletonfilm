Most go through their careers without firing a shot while on duty. Those who do, change their lives forever. The 1980\u2019s saw Australian police embroiled in a bloody war with armed criminals that led to reprisal killings, as fear and violence took control on both sides. Trigger Point has been given unprecedented access inside the police brotherhood, in search of answers to the tragic chain of events set in motion when officers use firearms against citizens they are sworn to protect. Featuring never-before-seen footage and raw, first-hand testimony from police who made the split-second decision to shoot - and have never before spoken publicly. Trigger Point offers a rare and engrossing insight into the consequences of carrying a gun as part of your daily routine.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xtSDB7i2dG6K0dYLMBSfuj5WgrZ.jpg", "actors": ["John Silvester (Interviewer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
