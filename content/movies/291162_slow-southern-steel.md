Shot in back alleys, parking lots, and the seedy green rooms of the dirtiest clubs that the Bible Belt failed to snuff out, these diehard musicians discuss their love of music and the south, as well as the difficulties, contradictions, and insanity that haunt every southern artist. There are no illusions here, no apologies, no distractions - only the straight truth as told by those who would know the difference. Narrated by the notorious Dixie Dave Collins (Weedeater, Buzzov-en, Bongzilla), Slow Southern Steel is an authentic and honest and thorough look at one of the most remarkable music communities ever spawned on the continent.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kDCxVu1lAoRbcsYgF4wiR6QsoKy.jpg", "actors": ["Trinidad Leal (Himself)", "Rocky Gray (Himself)", "Mike Williams (Himself)", "Hank Williams III (Himself)", "Beer Reebs (Himself)", "Mark Moody (Himself)", "Noah Ray (Himself)", "Ben Falgoust II (Himself)", "Gary Mader (Himself)", "Jimmy Bower (Himself)", "Jonah Citty (Himself)", "Phil Anselmo (Himself)", "Randy Blythe (Himself)", "Amber Valentine (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
