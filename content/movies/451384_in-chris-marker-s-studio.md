In the film, which was shot at two points between 2009-2011, Agn\u00e8s Varda visits Chris Marker in his studio, a few years before his passing.  She admires his magnificent mess, snooping around for details that reveal \u201cthe hidden side of Marker\u2019s work\u201d: a labyrinth of wires and computer equipment, a collection of images, magazines, and books, and \u2014 of course \u2014 cats. The film takes on a wonderful surrealist turn when Varda creates an avatar to meet Marker\u2019s avatar in the online virtual world of Second Life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nfSUVqzXQSj5pcQcR6ZuNR51NRS.jpg", "actors": ["Agn\u00e8s Varda ()", "Chris Marker ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
