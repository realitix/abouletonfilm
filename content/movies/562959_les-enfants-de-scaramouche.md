Inspired by Jos\u00e9 Martinez\u2019s three-act ballet Les enfants de Scaramouche (a choreography on music by Darius Milhaud that premiered in 2010), this 2014 filmed adaptation highlights the incredible talents of the young students of the Paris National Opera\u2019s Dance School. Roussillon reframes Martinez\u2019s work within a larger story of a boy named Enzo who dreams of becoming an \u00c9toile dancer. He and his young friends at the Nanterre School take over the stage of the Palais Garnier, dancing the story of Scaramouche with a carefree excitement that captures the heart and delights the eyes!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vINt6BfypJ5hrSBt8oa9lLtUIYB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
