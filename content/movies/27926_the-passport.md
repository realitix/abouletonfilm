He therefore assumes his brother's identity to get to Israel hoping his distant uncle living there will help him out. The plan backfires, however, when he realizes that the uncle is a paranoid lunatic thinking the KGB is out to get him. He becomes stranded in Israel with no friends, no money, and no passport, trying to figure out a way to get back home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jaXKcUND2j8RMXLV3zUs46ukLoK.jpg", "actors": ["G\u00e9rard Darmon (Merab Papashvili / Yasha)", "Armen Dzhigarkhanyan (\u0421\u0435\u043d\u044f)", "Oleg Yankovskiy (Borya)", "Natalya Gundareva (Inga)", "Evgeni Leonov (Consul)", "Igor Kvasha (Rabbi)", "Leonid Yarmolnik ()", "Mamuka Kikaleishvili ()", "Levan Gabriadze ()", "Irina Shmeleva (podruga Vasi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [311186, 83524, 102197, 27942], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
