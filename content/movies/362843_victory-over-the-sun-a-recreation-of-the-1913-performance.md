The DVD discusses the process of recreating the partially lost opera for its first performance in nearly 70 years. Director Robert Benedetti narrates the film as a documentary on the recreation process and as a guide to the surreal plot of the opera itself. A stage performance of the opera (translated into English) comprises the bulk of the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cqsu9r55uyk5vGaH3OOyUPfYqng.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
