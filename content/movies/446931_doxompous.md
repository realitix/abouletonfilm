The hungry wolves of Europe were preparing to dine on its corpse, and as a result the Byzantine army and its allies were constantly engaged in battles and skirmishes. In this story, a widow lives in the 14th-century Byzantine village of Doxobus with her son Xenos. She forms a relationship with a village elder, and when she gives birth to the elder\u2019s son, her son from her previous marriage is sent to live in a monastery. This is similar to his being sent to live in the streets, and is a sign that his mother either doesn\u2019t want him or is no longer able to keep him. When the boy reaches adulthood, he chooses the life of a soldier in the Byzantine army and swiftly rises through the ranks. In fact, as a reward, he is given the governorship of his native village, proving once again that success is the sweetest revenge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qsdszkrPkR5Bz3pQuseNO6p7yay.jpg", "actors": ["Tasos Palatzidis ()", "Stelios Kapatos ()", "Varvara Mavromati ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
