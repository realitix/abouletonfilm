Witness J.F. Cusson's massive 1/4 pipehits, J.P. Auclair doing the first-ever 360 degree man-made loop. See 4 kink urban rails, a record-setting hip jump by Jon Olsson, Candide Thovex going huge like only he can, C.R. Johnson's 110 foot inverted 900, Shane Szocs' crevasse jumping extravaganza, and the biggest, baddest, most progressive skiing on the planet. Poor Boyz--true to the movement. Includes music by Rage Against the Machine, Motley Crue, Face to Face, Pennywise, Swollen Members and many more.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dALrc68ldnhZsCKzmBKKJzyUCDq.jpg", "actors": ["JP Auclair (Himself)", "J.F.
