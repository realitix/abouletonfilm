There had been a heartbreaking loss at Subiaco to the Eagles, a spinetingling last second win over Geelong and then the most talked about victory over St Kilda on preliminary final night at the MCG.  In 2005 the Swans won their first final at the MCG in 70 years and on September 24 ended a 72 year Premiership drought.  Denied a premiership in 356 games as a player, Paul Roos etched his name into history by coaching Sydney to its first flag and giving the Swans supporters their first since the depression days of the 30s.  Grand Final day 2005 showcased the mighty Swans at their spectacular best.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yWbzJBgFVJFFqJKdoOvrmmyiwDu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
