All of the activities are, as required, recorded by a television crew. We watch a drainage channel being built and visit the local museum. Everything seems to be as it should. However, the documentary's authors leave the camera switched on even after the television crew has finished their work. As a result, the official record includes behind-the-scenes views and the members of the television crew become just additional actors in the film. The carefully arranged scene becomes an absurdly active image with advertising overtones.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oKjxSxmxn0GmZ4e97NTAOmBc4S3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
