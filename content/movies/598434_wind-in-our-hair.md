A story of early-teen anticipation and disappointment, WIND IN OUR HAIR is circumscribed by a period of profound Argentine political and social unrest. Using an intricately constructed Spanish-English \u201cbilingual\u201d soundtrack, Sachs and her co-editor, Puerto Rican filmmaker Sofia Gallisa, articulate this atmosphere of urban turmoil spinning about the young girls\u2019 lives. WIND IN OUR HAIR also includes the daring, ethereal music of Argentine singer Juana Molina.\"  - Taken from Fandor.com", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
