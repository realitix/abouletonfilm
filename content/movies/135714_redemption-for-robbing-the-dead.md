It follows the story of Henry Heath, a law officer in 1862 Salt Lake City. Heath finds himself responsible for the well-being of a prisoner whom he despises - an impoverished French immigrant named Jean Baptiste who is convicted of robbing the graves of the recently deceased. Baptiste is exiled to Antelope Island in the Great Salt Lake. With no one willing to look after this man, Henry Heath becomes Baptiste's sole defense against the hostile isolation of Antelope Island and the contempt of an entire community. Through his somewhat reluctant service, Heath's heart softens and his own sorrows find relief.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2xCmc4hrbt6StJGDDxSP72MyOkx.jpg", "actors": ["Margot Kidder (Marlys Baptiste)", "Jon Gries (Tom Sutter)", "Barry Corbin (Judge Smith)", "Edward Herrmann (Governor Dawson)", "Rance Howard (Doctor)", "Larry Thomas (Josiah)", "Jodi Russell (Mrs. Williams)", "Nathan Stevens (Ray Jenkins)", "Sean Bott (Lot Huntington)", "Tod Huntington (George Clawson)", "Danny James (Young Man)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
