Realising that the out of shape crew will be hard-pressed to win without a coach, Cutter swallows his pride and calls upon a retired curling champion - his estranged father. Now, these men with brooms, along with their new eccentric coach and Cutter's new romantic interest Amy, set off on a comedic journey which takes them from frozen lakes to huge arenas, searching for perfect stones, lost loves and second chances.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p17H0Dt7i7310uGrA7Pvyx6Oj5K.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Gross (Chris Cutter)", "Molly Parker (Amy Foley)", "Leslie Nielsen (Gordon Cutter)", "Polly Shannon (Joanne)", "Peter Outerbridge (James Lennox)", "Michelle Nolden (Julie Foley)", "Barbara Gordon (Eva Foley)", "Connor Price (Brandon Foley)", "James Allodi (Neil Bucyk)", "Jed Rees (Eddie Strombeck)", "Kari Matchett (Linda Bucyk)", "Hannah Gross (Girl at Game)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [35949, 143928, 27307, 55715], "youtube_key": "wGKKzueBDgc"}
