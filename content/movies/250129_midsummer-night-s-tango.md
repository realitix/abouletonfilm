But: Tango is THE folk music of the Finns. The documentary discovers the Finnish tango from the viewpoint of the singer Chino Laborde, the guitarist Diego \"DIPI\" Kvitko and the bandoneonist Pablo Greco. The three Argentine musicians travel to Finland to find out whether Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki is telling the truth when he asserts that tango music was invented in Finland.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zM31CeWi0du4d3xS1PoyQeipDCi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
