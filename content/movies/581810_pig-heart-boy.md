It stars Marlon Yearwood as Cameron, a 13-year-old boy whose heart is failing. The only possible solution is an experimental transplant operation in which he's given a pig's heart. His father (Patrick Robinson) is determined to try anything to keep him alive, but his mother (Clare Perkins) is not so sure.
