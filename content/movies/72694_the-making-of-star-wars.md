Well, bickering droid duo C-3PO and R2-D2 host this tour of the mind of creator George Lucas and what inspired him to make the movie. Even interviewed are the cast and crew, even features scenes of when C-3PO, R2-D2, and Darth Vader planted their footprints (or in R2's case, tread-prints) into cement. Also discussed is Star Wars mania, how fans loved the movie, collected the merchandise and danced the disco music. Also shown are behind-the-scenes looks at the movie, as well as how difficult each effect was in doing since they didn't have the convenience of computer animation back then.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/WgsInarGqxj5a33H1oO1IJACDU.jpg", "actors": ["Carrie Fisher (Herself)", "Mark Hamill (Himself)", "Harrison Ford (Himself)", "Anthony Daniels (Host, C-3PO)", "George Lucas (Himself)", "William Conrad (Narrator (original narration from 1977) (voice))", "Gary Kurtz (Himself)", "Kenny Baker (Host, R2-D2 (uncredited))", "Peter Diamond (Himself, stunt coordinator (uncredited))", "Garrick Hagon (Himself (uncredited))", "Don LaFontaine (Narrator (voice))", "James Earl Jones (Darth Vader (voice) (uncredited))", "Peter Mayhew (Himself (uncredited))", "David Prowse (Darth Vader (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [35795, 97015, 70844, 70866], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
