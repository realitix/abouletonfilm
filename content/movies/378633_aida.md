Aida (2003) Gran Teatre del Liceu. Verdi / Italian. Filmed at the Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona, Daniela Dess\u00ec, Elisabetta Fiorillo, Fabio Armiliato, Juan Pons and Roberto Scandiuzzi lead the cast in the renowned period production filmed in 2003 against the historic paper trompe-l'\u0153il sets painted between 1936-45 by Josep Mestres Cabanes, the last representative of the old Catalan school of scenography. Mestres Cabanes worked on his Aida vision for eight years. The opulent staging he created in 1945 is here in every detail. The seven magnificent sets he painted for Aida in 1945 have been subtly and painstakingly restored by Jordi Castells and his team \u2013 revealing the palaces, temples and surroundings of Memphis and Thebes which the set designer had wanted to evoke in his historical yet also fantasy-like vision.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sH4kRF1gduT8UyxheRMMNyeGFEJ.jpg", "actors": ["Daniela Dess\u00ec (Aida)", "Stefano Palatchi (The King)", "Elisabetta Fiorillo (Amneris)", "Fabio Armiliato (Radam\u00e8s)", "Juan Pons (Amonasro)", "Roberto Scandiuzzi (Ramfis)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
