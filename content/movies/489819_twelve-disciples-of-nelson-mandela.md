As the grip of apartheid was strengthening, a young group of concerned African National Congress activists exiled themselves to Botswana, Tanzania, and other \"safe\" locations outside of South Africa in hopes of battling oppression from the outside. By utilizing actors to create dramatic reenactments of events from that time, inter-cutting the newly shot footage with archival images, and tracing the path of his stepfather to the United States, Harris attempts to both personalize the plight of the ANC and simultaneously offer an in-depth account of the struggles the group faced while trying to abolish tyranny and restore justice to their homeland.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n1ft9Hv8cV0l1uxDP7LaUiv9AxU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
