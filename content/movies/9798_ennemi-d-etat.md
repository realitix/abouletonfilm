With the erosion of our rights and privacy online, this movie should have served as a harbinger of a world we do not want to live in.\r\n\r\nWe are introduced to the same arguments politicians, the wealthy and the agencies brought forth after the terror attacks we endured. The exact same rhetoric is used in this film (\"if you have nothing to hide...\"). At times, it looks like the real world emulates fiction or worse, this film was a blue print.\r\n\r\nFrom a protagonist unaware or unwilling to see the state of affairs, who's unwittingly caught in the path of bad guys, to what might then have been a tinfoil hat wearing, paranoid conspiracy theorist, but would now (post Snowden) be a a very concerned citizen, this film has what it needs to tell a good story.\r\n\r\nWhat's great too is the ending, which is bittersweet. It reflects pretty well what goes on in the highest spheres where the working class has little to no influence.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a great film for everybody."}, {"pseudo": "Wuchak", "content": "Fast-paced surveillance-oriented action/thriller with Will Smith, Gene Hackman and Jon Voight\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 1998 and directed by Tony Scott, \"Enemy of the State\u201d is an action/crime/thriller starring Will Smith as a DC lawyer who unknowingly apprehends evidence of a serious crime involving a formidable politician (Jon Voight) and is subsequently targeted by his NSA goons (Jack Black, Seth Green, etc.) and heavies (Scott Caan, Jake Busey, etc.). He ultimately partners with an ex-NSA surveillance curmudgeon (Gene Hackman).\r\n\r\nThe quick-editing is akin to other popular action flicks of the era, like \u201cArmageddon\u201d (1998), but it\u2019s done expertly and there are enough lulls in the relentless action and character-developing moments to prevent it from being overkill. The surveillance element and Hackman bring to mind Coppola\u2019s \u201cThe Conversation\u201d (1974), but the story moves way faster, has more thrills and the characters are more interesting.\r\n\r\nLisa Bonet (Jason Momoa\u2019s babe) is stunning as the protagonist\u2019s secret connection and former woman-on-the-side while Regina King is capable as the wife. There are several teases of ravishing women on the periphery.\r\n\r\nThis is a gripping, action-packed thriller that has quality characters and is entertaining throughout. The creators took the time & effort to throw in inspired little gems, like \u201cBaby\u201d the friendly orange & white cat (I have a cat just like him). Smith and Hackman have great conflict-habituated but respectful camaraderie. \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 12 minutes and was shot in Baltimore & Phoenix, Maryland; Washington DC; and Southern Cal (L.A., West Hollywood and Pasadena).
