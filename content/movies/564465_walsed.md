Where Deslaw negativized, I negate \u2014while recovering the original positive images\u2014, drastically reducing the film\u2019s 60 minutes\u2019 length and reversing the images in space and time.  I kept the same soundtrack, although equally compressed into 3 minutes\u2019 length and divided into two channels: one, in the original direction; the other one, reversed.  This negation of a negation is far from being an acceptation: the folk images and songs from a fascist country, underlying the NO-DO shots touched up by Deslaw, are negated; the filmmaker\u2019s intentions when negativizing/negating them are understood; but, seeing that the effort is not enough, this film goes beyond his proposal on the way to total destruction. - Alberte Pag\u00e1n", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
