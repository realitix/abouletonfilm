Not that Farley has any idea who Crosby is. He\u2019s led a sheltered life, homeschooled by parents whose idea of homework is trips to an art gallery or ashram. His best friend is Eve, the girl who\u2019s lived next door since they were both three. Much to the dismay of his parents, Farley loves to play shinny with the local rink rats. To their even greater dismay, Farley is signed to a major hockey league, where he achieves instant stardom, throwing him into a world of hype. Farley soon finds that hockey fame comes with a price, including the expectation to fight. Throw in a changing relationship with Eve \u2013 and Farley is losing his way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jMSjuubJT2mAWpPViwaq3liI7cW.jpg", "actors": ["Noah Reid (Farley Gordon)", "Allie MacDonald (Eve)", "Olivia Newton-John (Hope Gordon)", "Marc Jordan (Edgar Gordon)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "53UnxbugTOA"}
