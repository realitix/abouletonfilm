The Blu-Ray Experience II has something to please just about everyone: the operaphile (9 selections), the balletomane (4 dances), and the theater buff (1 scene). Even better, it samples both familiar works (the big three Mozart operas, Tchaikovsky\u2019s Swan Lake, Puccini\u2019s La Boheme) with unfamiliar ones (Cavalli\u2019s Ercole Amante, Henze\u2019s Undine, Purcell\u2019s The Fairy Queen).  With a running time of 54 minutes, most of the selections are brief but long enough to convey the essence of what the full productions would offer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zgcbvuaOpB0rT94hZQtxIo7izrj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
