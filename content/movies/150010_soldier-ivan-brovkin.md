That \u201cne\u2019er-do-well-ness\u201d proved \u201cKharitonov\u2019s special key to audiences\u2019 hearts\u201d. Following Brovkin\u2019s appearance on the screen, Kharitonov had become a star of the national cinema, an idol for millions of people. His incredible popularity may be compared to that of another national hero \u2013 the world\u2019s first cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. And not surprisingly, it was Kharitonov who made a cameo appearance going up the festival stairs and followed with the adoring eyes of the heroines in V.
