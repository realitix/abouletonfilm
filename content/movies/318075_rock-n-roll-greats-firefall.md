If you're a fan of Buffalo Springfield and The Eagles, you'll love this video. And for those who already are fans of the band, this video is a wonderful aural &amp;NFi;and&amp;NFi_; visual treat. Here, the band reforms after 20 years and delivers a set that underscores the beauty of their soulful tunes.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
