The film is inspired by three distinct periods of Simmons\u2019s photographic work: vintage hand puppets, ventriloquist dummies and walking objects enact tales of ambition, disappointment, love, loss, and regret. Working with composer Michael Rohaytn (\"Personal Velocity\") and cameraman Ed Lachman (\"The Virgin Suicides\" and \"Far From Heaven\"), Simmons\u2019s puppets come to life in miniature domestic scenes that echo real life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/frc9CBgQKquN2WTMv7PtJzU4oKl.jpg", "actors": ["Meryl Streep (The Woman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
