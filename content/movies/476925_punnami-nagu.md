As a result, the male serpent gets killed, and the female escapes. The only way Mayadevi could now acquire powers is first to locate a woman with a unique birthmark who must also be a virgin, and then lure the female serpent. The question remains - how will she find such a female, and even if she does so - how will she lure a now vigilant Nagin?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tZCCRlKGlAs3NPjqDf633cd9nm5.jpg", "actors": ["Mumaith Khan (Honey)", "Nalini (Mayadevi Bhairavi)", "Suhasini (Kajal)", "Rajiv Kanakala (Rajiv)", "M.
