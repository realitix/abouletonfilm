And in this time of age with the Lil Yachti's and Uzi Verts making it happen in today's landscape of rap-music I definitely see it as a possibility.\r\n\r\nThe characters are one-dimensional, the women as they are written in the film are only good for sex, and the men are only interested in sex but to get the women's interest of sex they have to be successful and this is the main reason why Massacre Mike is rapping in the first place.\r\n\r\nThat said Kearaun Harris makes it just about entertaining enough to not get bored and there are some amusing scenes it for sure.\r\n\r\nIf you like these sort of lowgrade little to no budget underground hood comedies like BUDZ HOUSE (2011) or WHITE T (2013), just don't expect it to be another Friday (1995) or anything (or even LOTTERY TICKET (2010) for that matter).\r\n\r\nThe fact that it's so short I think helps though if I'm gonna be honest, clocking in at just about 1 hour."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
