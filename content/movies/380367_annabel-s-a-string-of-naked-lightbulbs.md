Renowned for its discretion, and as a haunt of some of our greatest celebrities, the film offers a hitherto unseen glimpse into the rarefied worlds behind the doors of 44 Berkeley Square.  As London's very first members-only club, Annabel's remains the only nightclub visited by the Queen, and once courted infamy for refusing entry to the Beatles. The documentary provides a cultural biopsy of London since the Second World War, and the club's history from inception through to the present day.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yzOGTg8E47HNBlB2ydADXp0FR1W.jpg", "actors": ["Naomi Campbell (Herself)", "Bryan Ferry (Himself)", "Charles Finch (Himself)", "Lady Gaga (Herself)", "Goldie Hawn (Herself)", "Kate Moss (Herself)", "David Tang (Himself)", "Anna Wintour (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
