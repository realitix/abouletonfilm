He managed to convince the authorities that the Perm region needed its own cardiological industry and by mid-20000s a huge modern Cardiac Center was to have been built. The government allocated substantial funds for the construction of the Center, but its completion deadline was constantly postponed. Tired of fighting with regional officials, Professor Sukhanov sent on to work in the 200-year-old mansion, housing the old clinic. In late 2011, Sukhanov got an unexpected offer from the Kremlin to head Vladimir Putin's election headquarters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o7HLE8wOyobWlyKSpW4CbBRB2zp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
