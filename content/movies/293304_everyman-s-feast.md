Originated in parts of England, the myth of Jan Jedermann (\"John Everyman\") deals with a rich man on his deathbed coming to terms with his life's failures. Not following much of a plot, the modernized version involves famous fashion designer Jedermann (Klaus Maria Brandauer) imagining his last big gala event while rendered unconscious as a result of a car accident in his Ferrari. He is a success in Vienna but not in fashionable Paris, so he wishes to impress French elder stateswoman Yvonne Becker (Juliette Greco).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iYOLFFQfVprnRlzEg1NtLlFWIQt.jpg", "actors": ["Klaus Maria Brandauer (Jan Jedermann)", "Juliette Gr\u00e9co (Yvonne Becker)", "Redbad Klijnstra (Daniel)", "Sylvie Testud (Sophie)", "Alexa Sommer (Isabelle)", "Otto Tausig (Vater)", "Ellen Umlauf (Salome)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
