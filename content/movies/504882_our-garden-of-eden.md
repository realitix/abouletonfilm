People of various geographical, religious, social and political backgrounds till the earth of their respective lots here side by side, creating a microcosm full of dreams, loneliness, homesickness, joy, family tragedies, strokes of fate and conflicts. The Swiss concept of tidiness and order meets an exotic talent for improvisation, the will to integrate and respect meet ignorance. Christians and Muslims, people from nations at enmity enjoy a peaceful coexistence in the allotment gardens, sharing what seems most precious in our society today: time, attention and space. They find the path to themselves as well as a place in the eternal cycle that life is.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uJOaYtpgKrePpXF0zdK5w1xQ0Ty.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
