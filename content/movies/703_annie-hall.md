Was it worthy of all the accolades and does it hold up? Well, I laughed consistently if that tells you anything.\r\n\r\nThe movie uses techniques that were probably innovative when it was released in 1977, like Annie\u2019s immaterial essence doing something else why her body\u2019s in bed with Alvy (Allen). The dialogue-driven approach is refreshing (today, that is) and the way Alvy sometimes breaks the fourth wall is amusing. I also enjoyed seeing the mid-70s period in the background, like \u201cMessiah of Evil\u201d (1973) on the marquee and a billboard featuring DESTROYER-era KISS.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 33 minutes and was shot in New York City & Long Island and the Los Angeles area.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"}], "recommandations_id": [696, 5143, 829, 284]}
