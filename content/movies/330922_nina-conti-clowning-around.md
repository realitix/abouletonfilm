Devastated by the discovery that Monkey can only perform in hospitals if he can be boil-washed, Nina tries to go it alone with only a red nose, a few misshapen balloon animals and some slightly disappointing magic tricks. Not to mention her professional snobbery rearing up as she finds herself turning into a baby-voiced children's entertainer. Then there are the difficulties she encounters when faced with clown phobia. Following her directorial debut with Her Master's Voice which won a Grierson Award and a BAFTA nomination, Nina Conti brings us another frank and intimate documentary about her eventful two-year stint as a hospital clown. Join her to discover whether Nina raised a laugh amongst sick children or whether she cried the tears of a clown.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iMSWLQ8aJ37m0lA05LyEuRqhfYq.jpg", "actors": ["Nina Conti ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
