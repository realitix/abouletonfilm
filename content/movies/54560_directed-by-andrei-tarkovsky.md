Tarkovsky made only seven films in his brief, but brilliant, career; Michal Leszczylowski's respectful movie chronicles him at work on his last film, The Sacrifice. Offering insight into Tarkovsky's working methods and transcendental aesthetics, the movie is a compelling account of the difficulties of film production. In the case of an uncompromising and visionary filmmaker like Tarkovsky, the practical problems of filmmaking are only magnified, as cast and crew struggle to realize the ambitious concepts in Tarkovsky's mind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8z7dXTb9rgz9u7fiqjGp6YK4fzA.jpg", "actors": ["Brian Cox (Voiceover Narrator)", "Erland Josephson (Narrator)", "Andrei Tarkovsky (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [85107, 260387, 206978, 119905], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
