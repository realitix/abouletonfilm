Nikita had promised her son that no matter what, she would look after Tyler. Nikita always keeps her promises. After Veronica's divorce, she feels kind of shitty about her body and self-esteem, so she hires Will as her personal trainer. Will then decides to show her just how sexy she is. Bill just received his realtor's licence and is about to host his first open house. Being new on the scene he has Cherie, a very experienced realtor, join him. Things start to get heated, so Cherie has to put Bill in his place. Being a supervisor at work, Krissy took Michaels CV and moved it to the top of the pile to make sure he got hired.
