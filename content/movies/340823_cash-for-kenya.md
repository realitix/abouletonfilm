Jack Shaw's vision and dream of building a hospital in Kenya that would reach into the heart of suffering. Writes John Carter Cash in the liner notes: 'My father is still here in spirit and his enlightened passion endures. His wish to see the continuance of Jack's vision is coming true, in numerous ways. So as you watch this concert, and are taken in by the man's music, his charm and charisma, remember what he is singing for.' Among the rarely recorded, in the studio or live, are 'Man In White,' 'Angel Band,' 'Beautiful Life' and more.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/natgVmhW4yITk02kFwaeGhrmDsn.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Cash (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
