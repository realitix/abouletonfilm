With more than 200 works and a wide and peculiar use of pseudonyms, his work remains difficult to catalog, which makes it more exciting if it fits. Through a series of interviews with Franco, \"Ll\u00e1male Jess Redux\" brings the spectator closer to the sadist, esoteric and erotic world of the director, as refined as rogue. This new version of \"Ll\u00e1male Jess\" (2000), considered the reference documentary on Franco, and directed by Carles Prats and Manel Mayol, incorporates new unpublished statements by the irreducible Madrid filmmaker, as well as paying homage to his muse and companion, Lina Romay , Incorporating his active presence to the story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6uI9ln1fnGkzQwQyPBttmyMyAgl.jpg", "actors": ["Jes\u00fas Franco (Himself)", "Lina Romay (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
