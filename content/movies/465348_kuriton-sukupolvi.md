He can hardly recognize his rebellious teenage kids and materialistic wife who hardly seem to notice his existence. The only person who is interested in the professor's work is Marja, his son's girlfriend and freshman at the university. An innocent infatuation flares up between the old man and the young girl, while the professor's family is only interested in the prize money awarded to the professor by an international jury for his academic achievements.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hae0SUmAdA4RbgXkwaWybq9jFMu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
