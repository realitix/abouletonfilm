There's some decent action that delivers a high body count, but the rushed production and editing that was obviously and clumsily done to avoid a Category III rating regulates this to being just another average Hong Kong cops and robbers flick.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yMyXMkoKnPvjD5OYLJ23ugxtU4r.jpg", "actors": ["Elvis Tsui (Wong Bing)", "Chan Ging (Doggy)", "Ronny Ching Siu-Lung (Fire / Wong Ching Fo)", "Frankie Chin (Shik)", "Jacqueline Ng (Wong Siu Wai)", "Dickens Chan (Ko)", "Kan Sek-Ming ()", "Dang Suk-Yee ()", "Wong Kam-Tong ()", "Wong Ching-Ho ()", "Wan Seung-Lam ()", "Lau Sek-Ming ()", "Lai Hok-Ming ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
