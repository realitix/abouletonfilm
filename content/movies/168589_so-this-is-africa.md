They are hired by a movie producer who wishes to send them and their lions to Africa with a great naturalist, in order to make a jungle picture. An earlier expedition by this same naturalist was a failure, because she is afraid of animals. They all head to Africa and the lions are not mentioned again. Once in the jungle they have to fend off the amorous advances of the naturalist, of a vine-swinging native girl, and of a gorilla. They then run into the fearsome Amazon tribe, made up entirely of nubile females. Eventually they disguise themselves as Amazons to avoid being \"loved to death.\" But these disguises lead to further difficulties when the all-male tribe of Tarzans show up for their annual mating ritual with the Amazons.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sK3QAjBynSSgtjoceNJcZDHggU9.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Woolsey (Alexander)", "Bert Wheeler (Wilbur)", "Raquel Torres (Leader of Amazon Women)", "Esther Muir (Mrs. Johnson-Martini)", "Berton Churchill (President)", "Henry Armetta (Street Cleaner)", "Spencer Charters (Doctor)", "Patricia Douglas (Amazon Dancer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
