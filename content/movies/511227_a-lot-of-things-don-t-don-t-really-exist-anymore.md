I grew up in a fundamental Christian community that built their identity on the understanding of Christianity to be the only true way of living, and therefore a critical reflection about the absolute rightness of their beliefs was utterly out of question. Nonbelievers were seen as \"lacking something\", as people who either need to be educated or avoided. A binary opposition which decried all non-Christian cultures and people as incomplete was imposed, in order to define their own Christian identity as superior and to gain power over the other. The supremacy of an all-encompassing God who divides the world in \"right\" and \"wrong\", \"heaven\" and \"hell\" and the demand to commit to such a God always felt restrictive to me and deprived me of the agency.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qpatFeTZ527KAp7Tq4ukqL6XpYK.jpg", "actors": ["Stella Meris ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
