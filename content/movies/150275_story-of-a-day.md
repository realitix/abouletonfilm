Day breaks. A woman touches her eyebrows. A man shaves. Chickens are set loose and goats are fed. Little or nothing is said but the soundtrack gradually evolves into a rich, subtle combination of background noise and added sounds. This observation takes on a more contemplative mood, when attention is focused on the other subjects of the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gVl84sL6BHxENB9i4Je8Y6miPHG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "PeCpvzPjfuU"}
