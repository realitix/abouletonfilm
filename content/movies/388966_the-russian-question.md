Simonov. It is the story of an American journalist who spends time in Russia and sees socialism in action. Upon his return to the U.S., a prestigious editor asks him to write a book about his experience. He receives a handsome advance for the project and he and his fianc\u00e9e are able to buy a house, a car, and other symbols of the American dream. But the editor\u2019s generosity comes with a caveat: the book must present a negative picture of Soviet society. Will he simply keep the money and do what is expected of him, or will he instead tell the truth?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cegqWlhwKTiEKQZqrDfWO2lMYJC.jpg", "actors": ["Vsevolod Aksyonov (Smith)", "Yelena Kuzmina (I) (Jessie)", "Mikhail Astangov (MacPherson)", "Mikhail Nazvanov (Gould)", "Boris Tenin (Murphy)", "Mariya Barabanova (Meg)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
