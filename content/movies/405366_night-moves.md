The video starts in his studio, where his computer, desk and chair are \u201chaunted\u201d - dissolving and reforming in a myriad of mirrored shapes, going from recognizable to abstract to obliterated. The scans blend with Murata\u2019s own computer rendered fragments, further emphasizing the high and low, real and unreal. The result can be seen as an homage to both Walt Disney\u2019s The Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice and Bruce Nauman\u2019s Mapping the Studio.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lZX94bQVVEb1n5UVB7x8M81oxE6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
