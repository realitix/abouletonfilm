In excerpts from six different workshops, Abraham helps a number of participants soothe their emotions on subjects ranging from the sudden death of a child and the terminal cancer of a parent, to the loss of a beloved pet and the anguish of being personally touched by the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  As Abraham demonstrates step-by-step how to move from a state of grief to one of joy, they outline the practical and systematic tools that anyone can use to shift their feelings on any subject and, in so doing, reestablish their alignment with Source and regain their personal power. No matter where you find yourself on the Emotional Scale, the proven techniques demonstrated in this video will assist you in transforming your experience.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Esther Hicks (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
