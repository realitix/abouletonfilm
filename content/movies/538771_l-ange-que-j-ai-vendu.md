Why not be a film producer for instance? But it is easier said than done and he is soon relieved of 100,000 francs by a crook. Undaunted, he produces a film written by a young scriptwriter, Maurice Rogier, discovered by his daughter but does not believe it could become a success. Esther, for her part, decides to have \"L'ange que j'ai vendu\" shown in a local movie theater and the film immediately proves a hit. All is well that ends well, Esther marrying Maurice into the bargain.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yMFKc32oj44c8RyEblkc2M4t44g.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
