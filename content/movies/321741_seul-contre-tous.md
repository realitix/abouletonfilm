So he fought for his theory against the NFL who was denying it. I was neutral when #OscarsSoWhite broke out, but for this movie I definitely agree on that. Whether he would have won or not, Will Smith name should have been in the best male actor in the lead list.\r\n\r\nThat's not at all, this movie did not qualify for any other category in the event which is not unfortunate, but deliberately the Academy chose a wrong side to stand. Felt like they are supporting NFL instead of fact and its own product. This biographical movie talked mainly about one particular sport, maybe there are other sports in the globe that might cause CTE as must as this one. Since Dr. Omalu's research came from NFL players, so it was all about between them.\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderful movie, I was very surprised for it. In the past, every good thing in the world was always opposed in its beginning, but later accepted widely like the global warming. I hope people aware of such thing is exist and act accordingly. No need to abandon the sport, just change the rules and the style of play. This is one of the best movie you could find from the 2015. I think it is a must see biopic, the credit must go to Ridley Scott who is the man behind for this movie to happen.\r\n\r\n9/10"}], "recommandations_id": [303858, 295964, 321697, 296098], "youtube_key": "Io6hPdC41RM"}
