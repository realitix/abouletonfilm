Foremost on their minds and that of many of their classmates are what they are going to do this upcoming summer and beyond. They don't want to waste away the summer much like they did this past summer. Mike is being pressured by his parents to go to university following graduation from high school, although Mike himself is unsure if that's what he wants to do. Other ideas they discuss are to tour with their band, Arctic Madness, or to start a commune on a five hundred acre parcel of wilderness property outside of Timmins that was deeded to Mike. As the end of the school year approaches and these successive ideas come and fall by the wayside, the four come to a realization of what their future together holds", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bAy4wYX9cmJrM6PYjc7Nv9fuv3G.jpg", "actors": ["Don Scardino (Mike)", "Ralph Endersby (Steve)", "Michael Kukulewich (Cooly)", "Peter Gross (Richie)", "Hugh Webster (Mr. Duncan)", "Susan Petrie (Susan)", "Maxine Miller (Mrs. Duncan)", "Alma Matsh (Grandma)", "David Yorston (Math teacher)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
