Thaddeus, 22, gives up a cushy stockbroker job to pursue fantasies of killing Osama Bin Laden. Sara, 22, a dancer from North Carolina fails to make it in New York and leaves her best girlfriend to return home. Swept up in the patriotic fervour that followed 9/11, these young Americans dream of fighting for their country, of being the heroes that star in the slick ad campaigns broadcast by the military. Canadian director Sarah Goodman, living in New York at the time, saw long line-ups at recruitment centres as the country prepared for war. Gaining incredible access to the US army bases, Goodman follows the three new recruits for the next two years, starting with the harshness of basic training. Army of One is a heartbreaking film that exposes what happens to each of them as their dreams of heroism clash with the realities of army life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oleSEeD0dhqZKjFSLaWafz6LSqQ.jpg", "actors": ["Sara Miller (Herself)", "Thaddeus Ressler (Himself)", "Nelson Reyes (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
