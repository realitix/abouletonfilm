Unfettered nightlife and outlandish humor poured out of oddball outpost The CopHerBox II and onto TV screens.  Pooling business acumen with music scene prominence, James Christopher and Willie Woods opened the CopHerBox II in 1979 at 117th and Halsted on Chicago\u2019s Southside. To promote their venture, they purchased airtime on Chicago\u2019s WCIU-TV Channel 26 for weekly installments of The Chicago Party. Each Saturday, the club\u2019s adult clientele filled the illuminated dance floor, providing vibrant B-roll between tapings of breakdancing magicians and Jheri curled ventriloquists, giving an audience to a rising regime of Chicago Soul heavyweights.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rdIeIyCqaFhK9xKgj8rccr2E8h7.jpg", "actors": ["Willie Woods (Himself)", "James Christopher (Himself)", "The Unknown Skater (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "cgpDVVh1q8I"}
