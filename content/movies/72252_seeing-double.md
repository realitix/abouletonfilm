But the plot is intentionally ridiculous and cringe-worthy, the acting is mostly passable, the cast is likeable and the laughs are there (however weak they may be). I can't bring myself to give this a rating lower than three stars. Call it childhood nostalgia. (\u2605\u2605\u2605)"}], "recommandations_id": [95955, 53363, 53366, 105619]}
