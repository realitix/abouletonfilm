Themes include race, sex, and religion. Her comic persona is a self-centered hipster, brash and clueless about her political incorrectness. A handful of musical numbers punctuate the performance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3Q8pDGBV0uHel24kNupFam2638f.jpg", "actors": ["Sarah Silverman (Herself)", "Brian Posehn (Friend)", "Laura Silverman (Friend)", "Bob Odenkirk (Manager)", "Steve Agee (Guy in Wings)", "Jim Bodma (Grandma's Friend)", "Jon Cellini (Funeral Attendee)", "David Derby (Bass Guitar Player)", "Suzannah Fagan (Soccer Mom)", "Robin Goldwasser (Harmonies)", "Dee Kaye (Soccer Mom)", "Jonathan Kimmel (Harmonies)", "Michael Kotch (Guitar Player / Keyboards)", "Kiyano La'vin (African American Guy)", "Ben Matthews (Grandma's Friend)", "Mark Mclane (Funeral Attendee)", "Peggy Mollin (Grandma's Friend)", "Lillian Mower (Grandma's Friend)", "Rainy Orteca (Guitar Player)", "Emily Petta (Funeral Attendee)", "Alexa Power (Grandma's Friend)", "Kelsie Lynn (Understudy)", "Harry Schatz (Grandma's Friend)", "Eddie B.
