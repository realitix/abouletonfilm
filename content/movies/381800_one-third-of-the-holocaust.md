It thereby debunks one third of the Holocaust. The movie asks questions like, \"Would the Germans have really put a fence made out of tree branches around a deathcamp?\" Answer: \"Uh, no, that's silly.\" And would they have then conducted a huge burning operation inside this flammable fence?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
