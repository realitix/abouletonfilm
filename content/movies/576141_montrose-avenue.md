Narrated from the perspective of a 6-year-old girl, we travel up and down the street on a typical summer day. We follow the actions of residents, pedestrians and local merchants, as their daily routines take them to the local park, to shops or simply to chat in anticipation of the annual Portuguese Senhor Da Pedra festival and parade.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
