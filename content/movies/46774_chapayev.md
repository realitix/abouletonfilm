Chapaev is an uneducated peasant and a decorated hero in the World War I and later in the Russian Civil War, that followed the Russian revolution. This man of action is fighting on the side of the poor people. His troops consist of peasants, just like him. Unable to write, he can brilliantly demonstrate various battle tactics by moving potatoes on the table. He is street smart. He never lost a battle against the experienced Generals of the Tzar's Army.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jdoxlL1KdCNoGg0lPCCRIOP45KK.jpg", "actors": ["Boris Babochkin (Chapayev)", "Leonid Kmit (Petka)", "Varvara Myasnikova (Anka)", "Boris Blinov (Furmanov)", "Illarion Pevtsov (Borozdin)", "Nikolai Simonov (Zhikharev)", "Boris Chirkov (Peasant)", "Stepan Shkurat (Borozdin's striker)", "Vyacheslav Volkov (Yelan)", "Emil Gal (Tall veterinary sergeon)", "Mikhail Gipsi (A red soldier)", "Konstantin Nazarenko (The Lanky Fellow)", "Mikhail Rostovtsev (Short veterinary sergeon)", "Georgi Vasilyev (A white officer)", "Elena Volyntseva (Peasant woman)", "Victor Yablonsky (Cossack)", "Georgi Zhzhyonov (Teresha)", "Kasim Mukhutdinov (Red army soldier in Chapaev division)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [37174, 65264, 79594, 149845], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
