Specially made movie for tween kids, definitely they gonna enjoy. For adults, it is like a spoof and kids' version of the Spiderman movie. Yeah, it was kinda inspired by the Spiderman movie so they gave right credit by mentioning it in the story.\r\n\r\nMost of the modern Danish movies I saw were very impressive. They take challenging subjects and carve into a great piece. It is a lookout film industry like South Korea. So I laid my on this movie when I saw the first teaser as I am a children movie fan. This was a good movie, but as a middle aged man this did not work for me.\r\n\r\nThe kids gave their best, many were debuted with this so it's their first experience to perform in front of the camera. It's clearly visible their amateur acting skills. Only experience can teach and improve them on this field. For a maiden movie they have done a decent job except lack in facial expression in different situation of the story.\r\n\r\nThe first Danish superhero movie based on the children's book. This movie was very short, runs for less than 80 minutes, so it was the reason it did not bore me. As a superhero movie, there's not enough stunts in it. Looks like they kept it low to target little kid's audience. Even the story was also familiar, only characters were derived. Overall, it can be acceptable, but not by the large margin.\r\n\r\n6/10"}], "recommandations_id": [314285, 378932, 128128, 242167]}
