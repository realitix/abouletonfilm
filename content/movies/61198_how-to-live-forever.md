But whose advice should he take? Does 94-year-old exercise guru Jack LaLanne have all the answers, or does Buster, a 101-year-old chain-smoking, beer-drinking marathoner? What about futurist Ray Kurzweil, a laughter yoga expert, or an elder porn star? Wexler explores the viewpoints of delightfully unusual characters alongside those of health, fitness and life-extension experts in this engaging new documentary, which challenges our notions of youth and aging with comic poignancy. Begun as a study in life-extension, How To Live Forever evolves into a thought-provoking examination of what truly gives life meaning.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9UNAcBnCMFBqmVx0ZqZMdd9kxdK.jpg", "actors": ["Ray Kurzweil (Himself)", "Aubrey de Grey (Himself)", "Ray Bradbury (Himself)", "Suzanne Somers (Herself)", "Phyllis Diller (Herself)", "Marianne Williamson (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "UZGDUFHhyko"}
