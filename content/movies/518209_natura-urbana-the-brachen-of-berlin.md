The film takes us from the Tr\u00fcmmerlandschaften and their unique ecologies to the abandoned roofs of the Friedrichshagen Waterworks on the edge of the city. Encountering an extraordinary variety of spontaneous vegetation from all over the world that has sprouted along railway lines, street corners, and in the distinctive Brachen of Berlin. In Natura Urbana the changing vegetation of Berlin serves as a parallel history to war-time destruction, geo-political division, and the newest phase of urban transformation. Natura Urbana takes us on a unique journey through Berlin ranging from the botanical microcosm of cracked paving stones to elaborate attempts to map the entire city in terms of its distinctive ecological zones.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j1pzX9Vq30tmA1iK378vFtM1PO2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "p-VHOrC5a9Q"}
