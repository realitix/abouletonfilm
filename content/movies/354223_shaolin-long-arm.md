Like Bruce, the hero has even given his ma a promise not to fight! But that vow is forgotten when a quaint coastal Taiwanese town is terrorized by Japanese sadist and their insidious collaborators. Then our temple-trained champion uses his Shaolin long-armed style to break bones and take names...not necessarily in that order. Many a samurai sword swinging killer with Hitler mustaches are dispatched under his fingers and feet of fury but when he must face a tiger clawing traitor for the soul of the village and heart of the girl he loves all bets are off.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Lin Feng-jiao ()", "Feng Shih ()", "Lung Hua Le ()", "Leslie Sun ()", "Kiang Chang ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
