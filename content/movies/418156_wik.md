The characters wander through the streets, get into clubs, or go to parties with a blurred goal: distract themselves from loneliness, boredom, or an unfinished form of anguish, and spend time in the same way days pass by in this film, each one marking a different chapter. The filmmaker is able to find a tone that works hard to scorch on the common places of dilettante young people. Wik features both the passion of love encounters and its opposite side: the ferocious silence of wasted hours", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/VWj3l7mF8jpillV7XaXWGK63qY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
