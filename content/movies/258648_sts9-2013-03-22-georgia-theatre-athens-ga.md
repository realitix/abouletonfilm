The band played an explosive \"Scheme\" to start, followed immediately by the classic \"Artifact\" track \"Vibyl\". A rowdy \"Instantly\" had the crowd worked into a frenzy and a beautiful version of \"Circus\" followed. The old favorites kept coming with \"Warrior\", \"Arigato\" and \"Blu Mood\", which features a masterful guitar riff nailed by Hunter Brown. To kick off the second set, the band performed a dance-inducing version of \"Kabuki\". Set 2 continued the trend of STS9's most recent tour theme that blend the old with the new. Established favorites \"F.Word\" and \"One A Day\" were played amidst \"20-12\" and \"March\". During Rent, David Phipps' now famous haunting synthesizer riff had Athens fans waving their arms in unison. A powerful encore started with the funky \"Wika Chikana\". The band closed with \"Kamuy\", a song featuring Zach Velmer and Jeffree Lerner dueling on drums, showcasing the heartbeat of STS9.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iYjL341MZUA5Ul0Oe4wjkMmpt7B.jpg", "actors": ["Hunter Brown (Himself)", "Alana Rocklin (Herself)", "Jeffree Lerner (Himself)", "David Phipps (Himself)", "Zach Velmer (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
