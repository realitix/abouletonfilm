He surfaced occasionally - to make brilliant records that never came out, to star in William Eggleston's notorious documentary \"Stranded In Canton\", and to prove he was free, albeit on the run. Now he's 70 and has been diagnosed with lung cancer. Follow a heavily armed McGill and His fianc\u00e9e Joyce through four states as McGill battles death, battles life itself, seeking peace and making war. A thrill ride on the trigger finger of a career criminal, Very Extremely Dangerous is a documentary with dark humour and discomfiting intimacy.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
