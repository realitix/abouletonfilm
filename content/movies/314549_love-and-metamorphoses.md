But each of these transformations also plays on those of their performers, thus giving a new twist to Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses, written before and during his exile from the Roman Empire, and questioning the role of gender and identity in our society.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/98o8FCbeSFvUXcjHhafsjt4XTIw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
