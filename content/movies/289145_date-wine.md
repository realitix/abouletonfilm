The womenfolk, those too old and those too young are left behind... and as the years pass, only letters return, telling tales of loneliness and hard-times. A young man, Ahmed, grows-up under these surroundings and has to deal with being the de-facto man-in-charge; when several of the migrant workers return one day, everyone has to come to terms with things being forever changed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fQ4PG8ykCEAPXR1SOStD9xVGnZB.jpg", "actors": ["Hamdy Ahmed ()", "Fayza Amasaib ()", "Abdalla Mahmoud ()", "Mohamed Nagati ()", "Sherihan ()", "Abla Kamel ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
