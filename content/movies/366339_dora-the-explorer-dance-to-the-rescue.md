And the only one who can grant the wish is the silly King Juan el Bobo. But he's not going to give it to just anybody. We're gonna have to win a dance contest and get the silly king's mommy to dance. And she hates dancing! It's a dance filled adventure as we march past ants, wiggle around spiders, and slither through snakes. When a big storm cloud tries to block our way, we join forces with the pirate piggies and do our favorite pirate dance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jfKaZvOjVxj57gnzggLtxji4h2t.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
