He's a Yahgan craftsman and one of the last of his people, the Yahgans, who have lived in Tierra del Fuego for more than 6000 years. Long trips made with his parents let him get the deepest knowledge and secrets of ancient navigation. However, this way of life was violently stopped, due to the interventions of Chile and Argentina's states. Since then, the few Yahgan people remaining, cannot sail as before.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/masKjhHz0XP0VKu1ik2XzvT6VlJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "kKno7_Olw2g"}
