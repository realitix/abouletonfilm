The film features the legendary Glen Plake and his prediction two years before the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics that Jonny Moseley would win the gold medal. He was spot on. This two year adventure ensues not only hilarity and great cinematography but an even better soundtrack to accompany it. This, quite simply, is a tribute to mogul skiing.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
