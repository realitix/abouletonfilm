This Indian woman steals away from camp and decks herself out in the most remarkable finery. She is followed by her husband through the streets of the town, causing consternation everywhere. Ultimately she is followed by an English dandy, who mistakes her for a beautiful white woman, but they are caught in each other's company by the brave and the Englishman is scalped. The fact that his head is covered with a wig makes the scalping painless.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
