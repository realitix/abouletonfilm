It\u2019s the story of a woman\u2019s transformation into her true self, and a wild chase by her friends to find the woman that they think they\u2019ve lost. Among her group of friends Rachel is seen as the wallflower, but all of that changes when a chance encounter turns into sex so hot it lasts an entire day, and well into the night. Coming home one night Rachel\u2019s roommate spots her car, but without her driving, and assumes the worst: that Rachel has been murdered by the handsome man behind the wheel. Setting out to find her she unwittingly sets a series of events into motion. We watch as all of her friends join the hunt, and one by one find themselves in their own little dreams, driving LA\u2019s lonely streets and meeting lovers that will propel them to the heights of ecstasy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p7LWFfbO8i3RNXpCJH9zKA0LFTS.jpg", "actors": ["Chanel Preston ()", "Kleio Valentien ()", "Bree Daniels ()", "Skin Diamond ()", "Casey Calvert ()", "Lea Lexis ()", "Damon Dice ()", "Ryan Driller ()", "Derrick Pierce ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
