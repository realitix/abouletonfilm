But now, things seem to have settled down. Everyone has gotten back to their routine. Hank still enjoys the outdoors and loves to hunt. He and his wife, Dorothy, continue to live on their family farm in the rural Midwest. The picturesque autumn woodlands are a wonderful place to be. But things are not well.
