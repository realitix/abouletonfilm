Co-writer of the book \"Devant la recrudescence des vols de sacs \u00e0 main\", Pilippe Roger has filmed Serge Daney confronting him with four major stages in the evolution of cinema : by screening extracts from films by Chaplin, Stevens, Eustache and Truffaut, adding rhythm into this vivid and intelligent, strict but piercing documentary. Serge Daney takes risks : he rushes forward, plying between ethic and aestheticism, destruction and salvation, past and present, Europe and America, fantasy and reality, cinema and psycho-analysis, literary and technical languages, watching and showing.
