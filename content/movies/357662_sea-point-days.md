Set between city and ocean, this beautiful strip of \"everymansland\" offers a quirky and often entertaining mix of class, race, gender and religion: a place where South Africans of all backgrounds can experience happiness together... But is all as it appears? SEA POINT DAYS presents an unusual and impressionistic record of life at Cape Town's Sea Point Promenade and municipal pools, using largely cinematic vignettes to explore issues of belonging, integration, nostalgia, happiness and identity in an ex-white South African neighbourhood.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h4XN1srh1LRZwuYdJwlVvpyaEgZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
