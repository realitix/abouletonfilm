In this animated adaptation of a story by Sylvia Townsend Warner, we follow Lord Strawberry's search for the fabled bird. He finds it in the deserts of Arabia and brings it home to his aviary. Upon Lord Stawberry's death, however, the phoenix ends up as a sideshow in a fairground. This spirited satire of human foibles, with its timely message about our treatment of nature's creatures, will appeal to young people and adults alike.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Lister Sinclair (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
