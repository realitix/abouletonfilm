Filmed in Trucolor, Stallion Canyon was the maiden effort from Kanab Productions, a Utah-based organization. Former Sons of the Pioneers vocalist Ken Curtis made his starring debut in this one, playing a ranch foreman who does his best to track down a rogue stallion. The rest of the cast is comprised of unknowns, save for villains Ted Adams and Forrest Taylor. Cheaply produced, Stallion Canyon has the twin advantages of a relatively new leading man and excellent location photography.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eDQUr48t3gsHZJjgkHcBk5sfMlD.jpg", "actors": ["Ken Curtis (Curt Benson)", "Carolina Cotton (Ellen Collins)", "Shug Fisher (Red)", "Forrest Taylor (Tom Lawson)", "Ted Adams (Wolf Norton)", "Billy Hammond (Little Bear)", "Roy Butler (Sheriff Breezy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
