What evolved was a scene that set the ground work for what was to come in dance music culture worldwide, a rare insight into the secret underground world. It's the first time this story is told in a motion Picture, included in the film are pioneer dance music DJs and producers, \"founding fathers\", its center being Larry Levan, as well as high-profile DJs of today.
