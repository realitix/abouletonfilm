A semi-sequel to Donskoi's Raduga (1944), the story is set in Nazi-occupied Kiev. The drama focusses on the travails of a typical Soviet family and on the efforts by the Germans to force the reopening of a local munitions factory. The film is at its most grimly effective in a long sequence wherein the Nazis conduct a search for Jewish escapees, culminating in a horribly graphic re-creation of the slaughter of the Jews at Babi Yar. While Donskoi was critically lambasted for his cinematic \"sloppyiness\" during this sequence (hand-held camera, rapid cuts etc.), it can now be seen that he was attempting a realistic, documentarylike interpretation of this infamous Nazi atrocity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gVW5XoZkO3XwsJFzGPLD7GRX34d.jpg", "actors": ["Mikhail Vysotsky (German engineer)", "Amvrosi Buchma (Taras Yatsenko)", "Daniil Sagal (Stepan)", "Yevgeni Ponomarenko (Andrey)", "Mikhail Troyanovsky (Nazar Ivanovich Omelchenko)", "Ekaterina Osmyalovskaya (Valya)", "Sergei Troitsky (Policeman (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
