His father wants him to act more manly, although Jimmy gets his sensitivity from his mother. He wants to wed his girlfriend, and so accepts a job at his father's iron foundry, but does not excel there. Next, Jimmy goes to a tough dance-hall to impress his girl. A highlight is his parody of an Isadora Duncan dance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kursqQiAbDTDId5fvq36DvpxddK.jpg", "actors": ["Charley Chase (Jimmie)", "Martha Sleeper (Jimmie's Girl Friend)", "Evelyn Burns (Jimmie's Mother)", "Hardee Kirkland (Jimmie's Father)", "Noah Young (Dance Hall Troublemaker)", "Eddie Borden (Dance Hall Proprietor)", "Dave Anderson (Foreman (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
