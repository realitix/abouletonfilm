But in the decades that followed, new discoveries\u2014volcanoes on Io, a liquid ocean on Europa, and nitrogen geysers on Triton, to name just a few\u2014have turned that fantastical pursuit into a bona fide scientific endeavor. Second Genesis follows planetary scientist Carolyn Porco as she explores what it takes to look for life beyond Earth, and what conditions are required for life to exist. Porco makes the case that Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus\u2014with its plumes of water vapor spewing into space, confirmed organic materials, and evidence of hydrothermal vents at the bottom of its liquid ocean\u2014is the most promising place to look. Could Enceladus be the key to proving once and for all that life is not unique to Earth?  And what it would mean\u2014both scientifically, and spiritually\u2014if we found evidence of a true second genesis right here in our own galactic back yard?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
