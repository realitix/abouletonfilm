Network television executive Gavin (Nestor Carbonell) hopes to reunite celebrated Hollywood stars Piper Grayson (Reynolds), Kate Westbourne (MacLaine), and Addie Holden (Collins) in a TV special after their 1960s movie musical \"Boy Crazy\" is re-released in the 1990s. Though the three women share the same agent, Beryl Mason (Taylor), Gavin's seemingly insurmountable obstacle is that they all cannot stand each other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w5gFsS2Lo84BHxcp979agX7jixM.jpg", "actors": ["Elizabeth Taylor (Beryl Mason)", "Debbie Reynolds (Piper Grayson)", "Shirley MacLaine (Kate Westbourne)", "Joan Collins (Addie Holden)", "Jonathan Silverman (Wesley Westbourne)", "Peter Graves (Bill)", "Gene Barry (Mr Stern)", "Nestor Carbonell (Gavin)", "Carrie Fisher (Hooker)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
