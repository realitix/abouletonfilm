Quickly arrested for murder and jailed, Beauchamp insists he's innocent and asks the town's most prominent lawyer, Gavin Stevens, to defend him, but Stevens refuses. When a local boy whom Beauchamp has helped in the past and who believes him to be innocent hears talk of a mob taking Beauchamp out of jail and lynching him, he pleads with Stevens to defend Beauchamp at trial and prove his innocence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vBowCf6E2FQdeOtQMBkyNNi8mHH.jpg", "actors": ["David Brian (John Gavin Stevens)", "Claude Jarman Jr. (Chick Mallison)", "Juano Hern\u00e1ndez (Lucas Beauchamp)", "Porter Hall (Nub Gowrie)", "Elizabeth Patterson (Miss Eunice Habersham)", "Charles Kemper (Crawford Gowrie)", "Will Geer (Sheriff Hampton)", "David Clarke (Vinson Gowrie)", "Elzie Emanuel (Aleck)", "Lela Bliss (Mrs. Mallison)", "Harry Hayden (Mr. Mallison)", "Harry Antrim (Mr. Tubbs)", "Dan White (Will Legate (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [99898, 44098, 48646, 35401], "youtube_key": "RVOAKPavYWU"}
