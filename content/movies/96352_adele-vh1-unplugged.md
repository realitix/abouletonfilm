We have the song known as \u201cThe Contradictions Track,\u201d which is \u201c(You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman,\u201d in advance of the show\u2019s online premiere March 3. It may seem like a dangerous move for any singer to cover Aretha Franklin. Is there a more surefire way to feel inadequate?  But Adele smartly introduced the song by saying she wouldn\u2019t attempt to reinterpret it. While we agree with her sentiment (and respect for Aretha), turns out no disclaimer was needed. Listening up-close to Adele\u2019s mellow but true rendition, which required only minimal guitar and keys, it seemed to us there is no one Adele can\u2019t cover with her powerful, nuanced singing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7PMPU1zDj8mbisCmUN2VmZAQGO8.jpg", "actors": ["Adele (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
