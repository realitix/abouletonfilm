The models are based on Ancient Egyptian culture and its mythological figures, staged as tableaux: \u00abAnubis-Charon-Tableau\u00bb, \u00abIsis and Osiris-Tableau\u00bb and \u00abHorus-Tableau\u00bb. The single scenes are acted out using paper models of the figures and mythological objects. Different scales of light and shade form the background and help to evoke thematic atmospheres such as \u00abThe Air under the Wings\u00bb, \u00abCircling Night\u00bb or \u00abThe Black Shadow\u00bb.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["F.
