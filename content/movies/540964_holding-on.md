From humble beginnings and overcoming much adversity, they were labelled the Skid Kids and would gain worldwide attention for their reckless, no-holds-barred approach to surfing Shark Island, a wave previously deemed unrideable. Driven by the desire to push the limits in both wave-riding and life, the Skid Kids revolutionised board design, created innovative competitions and became infamous for their wild antics both in and out of the water. A classic Australian coming of age story, Holding On features never-before-seen footage and a killer soundtrack supervised by Parkway Drive\u2019s Winston McCall.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6ZhM1X5kRWZfXGy87pWNbrtGkoc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
