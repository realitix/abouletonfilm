From a Komodo dragon's virulent bacterial bite to a black widow spider poisoning her victim and a cobra devouring a rat (tail first), viewers get to see skin-crawling close-ups of Mother Nature's creepiest critters. Intriguing tidbits about each creature make the program as enlightening as it is hair-raising.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
