Nothing in Price\u2019s cinema is quite what it appears to be. Daytime broadcasts implode into personal confessions.

The memories engendered on these lazy afternoon are poured into Edie\u2019s unsteady form. \u201cA.\u201d took years to film and the interior locales stretch out over 3 or 4 of Price\u2019s apartments\u2026.it was a turbulent period of production in which Price became severely depressed and suffered a near-fatal accident while filming the suicide sequence.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
