New Orleans is the setting for Getting Back to Abnormal, a film that serves up a provocative mix of race, corruption and politics to tell the story of the re-election campaign of Stacy Head, a white woman in a city council seat traditionally held by a black representative. Supported by her irrepressible African-American aide Barbara Lacen-Keller, Head polarizes the city as her candidacy threatens to diminish the power and influence of its black citizens. Featuring a cast of characters as colorful as the city itself, the film presents a New Orleans that outsiders rarely see.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cHfia1ZGF6I4KnyBa8jxDTmoBsb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
