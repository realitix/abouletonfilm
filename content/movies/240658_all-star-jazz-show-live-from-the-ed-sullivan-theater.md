As staged at the Ed Sullivan Theater and directed by Gary Keys, it features performances by a who's-who of jazz legends who were still active at the time, including Lionel Hampton, Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie and Stan Getz. In the process, Keys also uses such elements as narration by host Dionne Warwick, and dance performances, to follow the evolution of jazz from classic American spirituals through the styles that became en vogue in the 1970s.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fiivFRXITUJqH0Uf1nuytaR7CbK.jpg", "actors": ["Stan Getz (Himself)", "Dionne Warwick (Herself)", "Count Basie (Himself)", "Herbie Hancock (Himself)", "Dizzy Gillespie ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
