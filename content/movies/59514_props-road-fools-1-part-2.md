Done in a documentary-style edit, making this a first in the way bike videos have been made thus far. Endless antics and humor, unreal riding that is gonna change the way you look at our sport, sillyness, and all good fun. Private First Class Dave Freimuth even threw on a bonus slide show after the credits. Don't miss what the critics have called the best video of all time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oi6d6s1IPgi1Cd9OUwFIKQlG2R5.jpg", "actors": ["Joe rich ()", "Taj Mihelich ()", "Jimmy Levan ()", "Dave Freimuth ()", "Robbie Morales ()", "Sandy Carson ()", "Derek Adams ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
