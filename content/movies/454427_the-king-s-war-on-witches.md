The church was fully behind this terrifying crusade against the imaginary enemies of Christianity. In France and Germany alone up to 40,000 people may have been killed as witches. But England and Scotland were almost untouched by witch persecutions until King James himself decided to launch his own, personal war on witchcraft.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Russell Boulter (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
