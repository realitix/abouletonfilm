In this moving film, teenagers in the NLF liberated zones make beautiful puppets from the remains of downed U.S. warplanes. They work their puppet shows in dramatic ballet form. Armed with these puppets, they travel through the countryside, performing for village children even as U.S. planes circle overhead.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
