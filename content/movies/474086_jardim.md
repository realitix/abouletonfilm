Throughout one year Jo\u00e3o Vladimiro\u2019s camera follows the work of landscape architect Gon\u00e7alo Ribeiro Telles, commissioned by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation. \u201cI know that the trees don\u2019t have eyes, that the water doesn\u2019t have a mouth, and that stones don\u2019t have ears. Still, we communicate. In this particular garden, long mute talks take place, like the two elders that, through their sheer presence, talk to each other about calmness, comfort and sadness.\u201d, says director Vladimiro, whose patient camera eye pays attention to the smallest events.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nRD2J0XIfRNWfR4zC61DZgMZ00w.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
