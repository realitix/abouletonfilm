The story is taken from a youth-oriented novel in which Dipu, a boy belonging to the educated class, is teased by the school bully but eventually forms a deep relationship with him. The rest is totally escapist in nature, including a scene in which the two youths manage to capture single-handedly an entire group of robbers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6NmxF1pnfYlPiUZz8GKqUU7aZQP.jpg", "actors": ["Bulbul Ahmed (Dipu's father)", "Arun (Dipu)", "Babita (Dipu's mother)", "Forhad (Babu)", "Dolly Johur (Tariq's mother)", "Abul Khayer (School teacher)", "Mashfiq (Tipu)", "Golam Mostafa (Jamshed Chacha)", "Shafquat (Shajjad)", "Shubashish (Tariq)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [464390, 421718, 93529, 467547], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
