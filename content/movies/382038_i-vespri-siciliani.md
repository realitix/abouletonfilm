'I vespri siciliani' ('The Sicilian Vespers') is a five-act Italian opera originally written in French for the Paris Op\u00e9ra and translated into Italian shortly after its premiere in June 1855. Under its original title, 'Les v\u00eapres siciliennes', the libretto was prepared by Eug\u00e8ne Scribe and Charles Duveyrier from their work 'Le duc d'Albe', which was written in 1838 and offered to Hal\u00e9vy and Donizetti before Verdi agreed to set it to music in 1854.  The story is loosely based on a historical event, the Sicilian Vespers of 1282, using material drawn from the medieval Sicilian tract 'Lu rebellamentu di Sichilia'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7XgDbqElzNh3CGFx49QqcuBAEo3.jpg", "actors": ["Fabio Armiliato (Arrigo)", "Daniela Dess\u00ec (Elena)", "Leo Nucci (Guido De Monforte)", "Giacomo Prestia (Procida)", "Dario Russo (Bethune)", "Dario Russo (Bethune)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
