A woman (Romay) notices a man spying on her from a hotel room across from hers so she gives him something to look at. This is basically three short films, ala three sex acts, put together with a short running time of 54-minutes. You can tell this is one of Franco's quickies that he filmed in a day or two but it features a nice score from Pablo Villa as well as being somewhat erotic. Making this erotic might be Franco's greatest directing work considering Romay certainly wasn't in top form here. She's packing quite a bit a weight, which is rather strange because I've seen other flicks from Franco in 1986 and her look is quite different. Oh well, the crazy world of Franco."}], "recommandations_id": []}
