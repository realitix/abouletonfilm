From among the pupils excels Sanyi, who cannot accept the fact that his mother does not love him and he keeps on escaping after her. From among the teachers it is Mr. Cs\u0151r\u00f6s who distinguishes himself by listening to the children, looking for those who escaped, Sanyi feels affection to him. On summer holidays he camps out at the riverside with his family, prospecting. The mother of Sanyi slanders Cs\u0151r\u00f6s in front of the boy, therefore Sanyi takes a revenge: he throws the gold collected by the man into the river. As it turns out that the slander had no ground, Sanyi begins to search for gold as well in order to make his error good.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wo6kGTmJbY8m4cqxUNMba8nRpb6.jpg", "actors": ["K\u00e1roly Eperjes (Cs\u00f5r\u00f6s tan\u00e1r \u00far)", "Dorottya Udvaros (Sanyi \u00e9desanyja)", "Eszter Cs\u00e1k\u00e1nyi (\u00c1rvai feles\u00e9ge)", "Maria G\u0142adkowska (Edit)", "Eszter Nagy-K\u00e1l\u00f3zy (Cs\u00f5r\u00f6s feles\u00e9ge)", "P\u00e1sztor Erzsi (Takar\u00edt\u00f3n\u00f5)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
