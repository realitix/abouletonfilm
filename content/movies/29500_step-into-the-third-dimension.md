The cameras used regular 35mm film that captured 4 simultaneous images onto 2 frames of film. These images were printed onto photo stock with a lenticular surface bonded to it which allowed 3D to be seen without glasses, like the old kids story books with the 3D covers.  The basic 3D camera kit came with this VHS instructional video that was hosted by Vincent Price. It was one of the last things he did.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rGdtNvBgnX1nsIcGje3gZGjDO0h.jpg", "actors": ["Vincent Price (Himself / Narrator)", "Jim McDonald ()", "Kim Jeffrey ()", "Shawn McDonough ()", "Brittany Paige Bouck ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
