The figure vanishes and the process begins again with a new pattern, each cycle lasting one or two seconds. The complete figures are drawn in a vaguely Art Deco style and could be said to resemble any number of things, an ear, a harp, panpipes, a grand piano with trombones, and so on, only highly stylized. The tone is playful and hypnotic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3TknQsPZpa2hUA8If3O52rMm1h0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [144651, 127817, 19006, 129303], "youtube_key": "uc5qPMSVixQ"}
