Rogers is that rarity, a country singer/songwriter who records with his road band instead of the usual session musicians, which gives his albums a relaxed, rough-edged feel missing from the standard antiseptic Music Row product.  The set climaxes with an extended workout on \"Lost and Found,\" from Rogers' debut, showcasing a series of solos brief enough to keep from devolving into tiresome showboating.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qIukRv4ZUHHKxe7gSAAWLcZX3Sn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
