Trying to understand that she won't be able to see the familiar building from her apartment in New York anymore and afraid of getting on a plane, she sets off for a road trip that is therapy and art performance in one. She has six weeks to get back to New York, and she spends them driving through a country in shock and talking to people she meets along the way. All of them share a strange sadness - not only about the attacks - and a surprising willingness to open their hearts and lives to this young woman with a camera. And by taking us on a trip through her country, she ends up leading us into the very soul of it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rJ2iI7QKBcGs3Rei0yTn6kVC8WF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
