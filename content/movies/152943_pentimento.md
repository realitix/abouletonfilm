In a monumental building a group of scientists submit women to obscure experiments, in which sexuality and cruelty constantly merge into one another. When the film was released, this horrifying game of power and powerlessness was condemned severely by a militant group of feminists. The criticism was undeserved. After all, 'Pentimento' is an art-historical term for a hidden image underneath the actual image giving an indication of how the latter evolved to its current state. The film does not endorse the lopsided power relations in our world but actually challenges them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n5kdGQiB8Xsbx2TxYrRjWXMsjSn.jpg", "actors": ["Helen Hedy ()", "Moniek Toebosch ()", "Trix Zwartjes ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [125606, 239268], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
