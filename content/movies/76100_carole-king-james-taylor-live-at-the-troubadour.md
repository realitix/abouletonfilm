Taylor had just released his debut album for the Beatles' newly formed Apple Records and King was finding her way as a first time solo performer even though by then she was a famous songwriter with a string of hits for other artists. When they returned to the club for a two-week co-headlining run in 1971 their lives were somewhat different. That summer Taylor's \"Fire and Rain\" was topping the charts and King's landmark Tapestry was on its way to making her a music superstar. Thirty-six years later, in November 2007, James Taylor, Carole King and members of their renowned original band \"The Section\" (featuring guitarist Danny Kortchmar, bassist Leland Sklar and drummer Russell Kunkel) returned to the Troubadour for a three-night, six-show run to celebrate the venue's 50th anniversary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d5UqELxRiySjeqj5AdGmvcIAy0X.jpg", "actors": ["Carole King (Carole King)", "James Taylor (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
