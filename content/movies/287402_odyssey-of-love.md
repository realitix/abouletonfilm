After all, he is surrounded by women clamoring for time with him in bed. So are all the other men in the story. When one of his sons dies suddenly during an operation, Paul is devastated and cannot make out what has gone wrong in his life. None of his current crop of friends has any insight to offer. Some of these questions become clearer when his sister, with whom he is almost unnaturally close, comes to visit.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yuTKDZClEamOvVXBXhOabFE7zS3.jpg", "actors": ["Herbert Flack (Paul Henkes)", "Sarah Brackett (Elizabeth Henkes)", "Patty Brard (Valerie)", "Liz Snoyink (Zippy)", "Eddie Marchena (Ramon)", "Ramon Todd Dandare (Nicholas)", "Devika Strooker (Ramona)", "John van Dreelen (Dr. Alexander De Winter)", "Mavis Helneyer (Aida)", "Lilian van Everdingen (Isabela)", "Laura Quast (Koningin van de Nacht)", "Myrena Sint Jago (Cecilia)", "Kenneth Hardigein (Waldo)", "Monifa King (Belinda)", "Thom Hoffman (Bart Buisman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
