When the residents of a large old house learn that it is to be torn down and that they will be relocated elsewhere, an intense game gets underway. As is usual in such instances, the residents will be given new apartments commensurate in size with their old ones. Dibusz sees this as an opportunity to temporarily enlarge his \"assigned\" space in the condemned building. He wants to be reassigned to an apartment which is larger than his current bathless one-room space. He and a neighbor cooperate to break down the walls that separate their spaces from that of an old woman who just died after a brief tussle. Still not satisfied, he tries to marry one of two spinster women who live together but is rejected. In the course of the film, he has intense encounters of one sort or another with anyone who might be of help to him in his quest.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jMKk0O9ih6N7nT4UlhC9s8LABkE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
