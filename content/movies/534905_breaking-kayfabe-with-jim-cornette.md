Regardless of what you think of some of his booking decisions recently, I don\u2019t think you can deny the fact that Cornette is a smart, entertaining speaker. I\u2019ve watched a few shoot interviews with Cornette in the past, and they always deliver. I loved his installment of the Timeline series for Kayfabe Commentaries, and his joint shoot interviews with Bobby Heenan and Paul Bearer for ROH were very entertaining.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6FuJhYWRIIoTjYkMXf9JHX7jDwD.jpg", "actors": ["Jim Cornette (Jim Cornette)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
