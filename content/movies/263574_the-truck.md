The story centers around transporting a worker's corpse, in a truck, to the mountain village where he was born. In the truck is: a man who may be suffering from tuberculosis, and who has an unfaithful wife at home; a doctor (the intellectual); a bookkeeper worried over the salaries she pays out; a hermit picked up on the road; and the driver who is a rough-and-ready working-class symbol. The seeds for conflict are set both by the personalities of the five in the truck and by their social background. The director Christo Christov, acknowledges his debt to Henri-Georges Clouzot and the Wages of Fear, for inspiration in the treatment of human conflict, its development through a set storyline, and its resolution in each of the five cases.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Grigor Vachkov (Dedleto)", "Lilyana Kovacheva (Milena)", "Veselin Vulkov (Shteryo)", "Stefan Dimitrov (Doktorat)", "\u0110oko Rosi\u0107 (Chitanugata)", "Zhivka Peneva ()", "Emil Markov ()", "Yordan Spirov ()", "Nikolay Nachkov ()", "Hristo Krachmarov ()", "Iwan Tomow ()", "Minka Syulemezova ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
