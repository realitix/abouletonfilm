The next view shows the Emperor Charlemagne crowning his son Lewis. The film closes with the wreath of orange blossoms encircling a bridal party.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g3okmvieXp0vNVRZSDejaXlr0o3.jpg", "actors": ["Ren\u00e9e Carl ()", "Alice Tissot ()", "Georges Wague ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
