He was a child prodigy but the man behind the violin was harder to know. Endlessly touring and crossing continents and cultures, his contract with EMI was the longest in the history of the music industry. He took classical music out of the concert hall because he believed music was for everyone and had the power to change lives. An impassioned idealist, Yehudi wanted to give more to the world - he became a tireless fighter for humanitarian issues he believed in.  In this film, commemorating the 100th year of his birth, family and close friends recall his extraordinary musical life, in which he embraced jazz and Indian ragas as much as Bach, Beethoven and Bartok. And incredible home movies take us on an intimate behind-the-scenes journey from his childhood in California, to meeting gypsies in Romania and travelling to India and beyond.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ghu62xuc1D3ay5Xsi7RGLPxXLNe.jpg", "actors": ["Clemency Burton-Hill (Presenter)", "Zamira Benthall (Herself (Yehudi Menuhin's Daughter))", "Krov Menuhin (Himself (Yehudi Menuhin's Son))", "Tasmin Little (Herself (Violinist, Interviewee))", "Daniel Hope (Himself (Violinist, Interviewee))", "Gordon Back (Himself (Yehudi\u2019s Accompanist, Artist Director of the Menuhin Competition))", "Christopher Hope (Himself (Close Friend))", "Anoushka Shankar (Herself (Ravi Shankar\u2019s Daughter))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
