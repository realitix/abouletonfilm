After eating some \"special\" mushrooms, innocent Esperanza becomes modern and psychodelic Brenda: a subversive girl who raids a high-society party, sings subversive songs and charms young fellows. Brenda and five boys leave the party, assault an ice-cream parlor (they ask for \"five of chocolate and one of strawberry\") and finally kidnap a banker. In between, a Commissioner from the Surveillance International Agency follows Brenda's tracks, while the girl changes personalities due to the mushroom eating.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pf4TzvU2SsTvSvDjJuzXOmGMKCN.jpg", "actors": ["Ang\u00e9lica Mar\u00eda (Brenda, Esperanza, Domitila)", "Fernando Luj\u00e1n (Miguel Ernesto Su\u00e1rez)", "Enrique Rambal (Commissioner)", "Roberto Ca\u00f1edo ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
