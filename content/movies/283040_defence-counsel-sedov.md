Three women whose agronomist husbands have been sentenced to death for alleged sabotage beg him to take on the seemingly hopeless task of saving them. Sedov embarks upon a succession of encounters with increasingly powerful officials, gradually persuading them to look at the case anew. But the highest authorities are not so easily outmanoeuvered, and Sedov becomes canonised as a Stalinist zealot, with the film building inexorably to its chilling triple climax.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zRveiQD82k1uRECjW3slwZpXznP.jpg", "actors": ["Vladimir Ilin ()", "Albina Matveyeva ()", "Tamara Chernova ()", "\u0422\u0430\u0442\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0430 ()", "Vatslav Dvorzhetsky ()", "Vsevolod Larionov ()", "Garik Sukachyov ()", "Natalya Shchukina ()", "\u0418\u0433\u043e\u0440\u044c \u0428\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0433 ()", "Pyotr Merkuryev ()", "Sergei Artsybashev ()", "Yuriy Sherstnyov ()", "Aleksandr Mokhov ()", "Mariya Barabanova ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [62692, 11809], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
