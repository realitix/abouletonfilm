Described in classic Persian poetry as a \u2018paradise garden,\u2019 the impenetrable nature of the valley and its lush, fertile landscape have set it apart from the rest of the country and encouraged a history of independence and resistance. Hugonnier\u2019s film considers how the specificities of a landscape help to determine its history. After the crew is unable to film the valley from a vantage point in the surrounding Hindu Kush mountains, Ariana becomes the story of a failed project that prompts a process of reflection about the \u2018panorama\u2019 as a form of strategic overview, as a cinematic camera move, and its origins as pre-cinematic mass entertainment.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
