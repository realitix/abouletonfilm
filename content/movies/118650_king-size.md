When Vincent and Nicholas, a very much integrated and respected long-time couple, suddenly decide to live together with young Gabriel, they must confront the moral disapproval of their gay friends, a jealous sister, and practicalities like how to find a bed that's big enough. Filmed against a stunning Paris as backdrop, this all-out song and dance extravaganza almost explodes on-screen in a very French 'Joie de vivre'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lJbHnrRFnVRWrbDggOpnuGeSWN1.jpg", "actors": ["Jonathan Burteaux (Gabriel)", "Laurent Artufel (Vincent)", "Claude Jan (Nicolas)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
