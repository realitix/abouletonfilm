Briefly covering much of his early British works, the film primarily focuses on his American classics, such as \"Shadow of a Doubt\", \"Notorious\", \"Rear Window\", \"Vertigo\", \"Psycho\" and \"The Birds\". The movie also covers his television years and neatly examines the Hitchcock signature touches, from his inevitable brief cameo to his famous MacGuffin.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6JrRGT5d2DSBYnUE1Plw0urN27L.jpg", "actors": ["Kevin Spacey (Narrator)", "Jonathan Demme (himself)", "Brian De Palma (himself)", "Peter Bogdanovich (himself)", "Janet Leigh (herself)", "Curtis Hanson (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
