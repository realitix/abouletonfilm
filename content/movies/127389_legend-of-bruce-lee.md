She begs him to change his ways, yet after a humiliating defeat Bruce vows that it will never happen again, and while witnessing street thugs preying on innocent people, he is driven to defend them. Things appear to be no better when Bruce comes to the United States to begin teaching, and is under constant attack by rival martial artists, but all the while his unorthodox style is beginning to catch on. Finally he becomes an international sensation as a movie star with a wife, kids, money, and everything he's always wanted - who then must fight for both his life and his reputation back home in Hong Kong.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ggv8Cg5GmZoX2xB6kXposhK2ls8.jpg", "actors": ["Ho Tsung-Tao (Bruce)", "Hsieh Ling-ling (Chow Ming)", "Au-Yeung Chung (Hsiao Hu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
