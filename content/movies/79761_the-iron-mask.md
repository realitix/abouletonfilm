But when the queen delivers a twin, Cardinal Richelieu sees the second son as a potential for revolution, and has him sent off to Spain to be raised in secret to ensure a peaceful future for France. Alas, keeping the secret means sending Constance, lover of D'Artagnan, off to a convent. D'Artagnan hears of this and rallies the Musketeers in a bid to rescue her. Unfortunately, Richelieu out-smarts the Musketeers and banishes them forever.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9Yr7IHgbpTmS6gYA23VROcqY6EG.jpg", "actors": ["Douglas Fairbanks (D'Artagnan)", "Belle Bennett (The Queen Mother, Anne of Austria)", "Marguerite De La Motte (Constance Bonacieux)", "Dorothy Revier (Milady de Winter)", "Vera Lewis (Madame Peronne)", "Rolfe Sedan (Louis XIII)", "William Bakewell (Louis XIV / Twin Brother)", "Nigel De Brulier (Cardinal Richelieu)", "Lon Poff (Father Joseph)", "Charles Stevens (Planchet - D'Artagnan's Servant)", "Henry Otto (The King's Valet)", "L\u00e9on Bary (Athos)", "Tiny Sandford (Porthos)", "Gino Corrado (Aramis)", "Ullrich Haupt (De Rochefort)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [53799], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
