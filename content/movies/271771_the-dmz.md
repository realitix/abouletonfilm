After the Armistice is signed, two children who were caught in the back-and-forth shifting of the front line find themselves abandoned in the demilitarized zone (DMZ). The children a boy and a girl survive by picking up discarded military rations and roasting wild potatoes. They wander the DMZ and have various experiences, like the time a land mine they use as a rock explodes and they run away in terror. As they roam the no man's land separating North and South, they encounter a North Korean spy on his way back across the border. The boy is killed, and the girl travels south in search of her mother.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9j6wRKDYS3VwbP64jiflqBNl6tC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
