Filmmaker Rea Tajiri\u2019s family was among the 120,000 Japanese and Japanese Americans who were imprisoned in internment camps after the attack on Pearl Harbor. And like so many who were in the camps, Tajiri\u2019s family wrapped their memories of that experience in a shroud of silence and forgetting. This film raises questions about collective history \u2013 questions that prompt Tajiri to daringly re-imagine and re-create what has been stolen and what has been lost.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
