Part one finds a silent film actor upset because of a rival actor's attention to the former's wife. When he kills his rival, it is only when he is strapped to the electric chair that he realizes that this is his last live scene. The second episode has the wife of an elderly British nobleman having an affair with the young gamekeeper of their estate. Part three finds a peasant woman taking a lover when her husband goes off to fight the war.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/67YE83gmn7xyPRobjJWDd7Ts7sV.jpg", "actors": ["Walter Giller (George Randy)", "Gitte H\u00e6nning (Mary Randy)", "Juraj Herz (William Poker)", "V\u00e1clav Lohnisk\u00fd (Reziser)", "Jaroslav \u0160tercl ()", "Vivi Bach (Else)", "Jana Brejchov\u00e1 (Lady Mary)", "Richard M\u00fcnch (Lord Edward)", "Gerhard Riedmann (Kurt)", "Nadja Tiller ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
