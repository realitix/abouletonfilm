The heart of the DVD is an ABC television special featuring live performances of \"Toxic,\" \"Breathe on Me,\" and \"I'm a Slave 4 U.\" A fun highlight is Spears's hip-hop collaboration with the Ying Yang Twins on \"(I Got That) Boom Boom,\" one of the few numbers in the star's stage repertoire with a little room for spontaneity. Between songs one finds Spears gushing over her grandfather, praising her entourage, describing the emotional toll of being in the public eye, and writing songs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7x2DEVt8aXhifDHuHyhepMExvc2.jpg", "actors": ["Britney Spears (Herself)", "Madonna (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [58624, 34900], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
