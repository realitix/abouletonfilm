He fears self-censorship is yet to be undone as \"people have created their own prisons.\" Elsewhere in Cairo, street art is burgeoning in a joyful expression of freedom. \"It's the first time that I walk past things like these that express happiness and contentment\", an old man explains, smiling. Karima Mansour is a choreographer whose dance expresses the complexities of a society in which there are veiled women, \"but we also have women like me. I am a dancer working with the body.\" She now wants access to state-run theatres, something forbidden to independent artists under the old regime.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
