They save money to move out of the house. Due to his lack of self confidence, Aimo wastes their savings to turbo-boost his muscles. As conventional body building is not quite satisfactory, Aimo tunes himself up into a robot. Milla doesn't like the new Aimo-Robot and leaves him. Aimo\u00b4s heartache leads him to extreme measures as he also changes his heart into a metal one, one that doesn't hurt. Milla decides to steal Aimo heart: after all, a woman needs to have a man\u00b4s heart. Lovemilla is an anarchistic comedy trip, a comedy about love, a story about love, robots and bodybuilding.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8Zz78kVrcNMqKI3oyXhOzBVgdaO.jpg", "actors": ["Milka Suonp\u00e4\u00e4 (Milla)", "Joel Hirvonen (Aimo)", "Antti Reini (Vessafilosofi (voice))", "Pelle Heikkil\u00e4 (Esa)", "Ville Jankeri (Vartija)", "Jari Virman (Kyyhkynen, Ky\u00f6sti)", "Miila Virtanen (Sanna)", "Hannamaija Nikander ()", "Pauliina Suominen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "XjAIUoI2E-w"}
