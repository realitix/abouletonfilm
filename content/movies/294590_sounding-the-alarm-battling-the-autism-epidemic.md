None of us are more than a family member or neighbor away from autism. The disorder has been growing so fast it has been described as a tsunami - one of which our state and federal government and social agencies are woefully unprepared. The challenges don\u2019t happen in a vacuum, and children with adults grow into adults with autism. Sounding the Alarm follows autism families as they negotiate tangled rules and regulations, and steadfastly fight to find and afford the right care and treatment for their loved ones throughout their lives. As the film reveals, even a rock star, a wounded warrior and the president of one of the world\u2019s most powerful media and entertainment companies can struggle to get the help they need.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9Snz6tmXwnJu3Cw8C4shjjkrwfj.jpg", "actors": ["Stephen Kanne (Himself)", "James Lankford (Himself)", "Kent Martling (Himself)", "Christopher McDougle (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
