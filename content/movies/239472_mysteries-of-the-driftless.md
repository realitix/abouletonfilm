And what pre-Ice Age throwbacks survived here in this unique geologic refuge that holds more Native American effigy mounds, petroglyph caves, strange geological features, and rare species than anywhere in the Midwest? These questions and more are answered in this captivating new documentary. A team of scientists embarks on a journey of exploration to expose both the science and threats behind three unique features of the zone - rare plants and animals, odd geological phenomenon, and striking remnants of a Native American pilgrimage like no other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qlSrZNP8aSSVMUwv0XSt0KkLF0l.jpg", "actors": ["Armund Bartz (Himself)", "Dan Bertalan (Himself)", "Mark Bishop (Himself)", "Ryan Bishop (Himself)", "Ernie Boszhardt (Himself)", "Abbie Church (Herself)", "George Howe (Himself)", "Darcy Kind (Herself)", "Jim Knox (Himself)", "Rob Nelson (Himself)", "Loran Nordgren (Himself)", "Ryan Perroy (Himself)", "Jim Theler (Himself)", "Tim Yager (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "1b0EDeMCl6w"}
