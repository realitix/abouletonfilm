The film revisits the struggles of the nation and examines what drives over 700 Salvadorans to flee their homeland each day, often risking their lives to illegally enter countries in search of a better life for their families. The film also profiles a number of Salvadorans effected by the civil war. One couple, who fled death threats in the 1980s, finds asylum and a political platform in the United States. The film also follows a different couple who, after escaping the war, returned to El Salvador to work with churches and poor communities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gVrw5Aikhmy0mmp33RndSpfB1Qz.jpg", "actors": ["Hector Antonio Garcia Berrios (Himself)", "Dean Brackley (Himself)", "Monsenor Rosa Chavez (Herself)", "Deysi Cheyne (Herself)", "Betsy Morgan (Herself)", "Raul Moreno (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
