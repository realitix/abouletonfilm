Simon is a hustler caught in the underbelly of queer culture. Late one night Simon slips on the ice that throws him into the arms of Evan, the host of a cable show who suffers from Tourette's Syndrome. After a night of unbridled sex, Simon realizes that Evan's ticks have subsided. He believes that he is meant to save Evan from his afflictions, leading them to unabashedly dive into a sado-masochistic relationship. Simon basks in a world where sadness and depression have become his new turn on and where his emotional destruction is the only true way to give Evan his soul.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/31e3Yv4BhzRsTABW5b7CfOSvXRm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
