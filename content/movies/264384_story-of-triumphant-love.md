Their sudden arrival makes Fabiusz anxious because years ago Mucjusz was in love with his beautiful wife Waleria. The visitor, however, assures Fabiusz that during his wanderings he has met many other women and has forgotten his old flame. The master of the house offers for him to stay in the garden pavilion. At the party in their honor, while Mucjusz distributes gifts to everyone present, Malaj plays the charming \"Song of Love.\" It's rumored that those who are in love can do unusual things while listening to this melody at night. To prove it Mucjusz pierces his chest with a stiletto and takes it out without a sign of pain. At night Waleria wakes up to the sounds of the charming song coming from the outside and goes to the pavilion. In their conversation Mucjusz confesses that he still loves her but he has leprosy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yFVKRHzxThA5jcoprHmte2j7YMx.jpg", "actors": ["Beata Tyszkiewicz (Waleria)", "Piotr Wysocki (Mucjusz)", "Andrzej May (Fabiusz - Waleria's husband)", "Jerzy Joga\u0142\u0142a (Malaj - Mucjusz's servant)", "Tadeusz Minc (Servent)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
