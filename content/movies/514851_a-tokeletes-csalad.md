There is a book entitled \"How I Will Be Rich, the Idea Publishing Company\" for a \"great success\". Well, if you have the right luck to sell your Boldizs\u00e1r, you already have a high-ranking bookstore job. His good or bad fate brings him to the Counts of Nyulassy. But in vain, enthusiasm, if there is a lack of fitness. The Nyulassy family, wishing to maintain the semblance of wealth, completely devastates it. The Countess only takes his book and gets his money on a card, Count Fricie does a little more: steals and sells Boldizs\u00e1r's car.
