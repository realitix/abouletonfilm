Both films speak about the impairing ability to communicate as well as the desire and impossibility to establish a relationship, and a party as background scenery. Where Antonioni's film depicts a luxurious party in Milan, Grau's version portraits the gathering of several characters with no expectations on the night of the sommer solistice in Barcelona.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tV5QpAicydIz9Ssf1euqUJmL4zE.jpg", "actors": ["Francisco Rabal (Bernardo)", "Mar\u00eda Cuadra (In\u00e9s)", "Umberto Orsini (Miguel)", "Marisa Solinas (Alicia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
