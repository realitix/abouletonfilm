They explore a nearby island for treasure and find the owner is being robbed by his gamekeepers. Brought before Sir Hugo the children convince him of their story but the gamekeepers lock them all up. They find a secret passage leading to the legendary crusader treasure and also find their way back to the castle. Again they are caught and left in a dungeon flooded at high tide.
