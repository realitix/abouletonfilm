He takes various body samples - hair, phlegm, etc. - and puts them under the microscope. The \"microbes\" coalesce and form different shapes, creating caricatures of various people, such as mothers-in-law and drunks. These animated characters goof around in traditional cartoon fashion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b8C6jCUW7YOdpKqHFjZ2GJCbMrX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [120012, 119980, 120010, 119988], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
