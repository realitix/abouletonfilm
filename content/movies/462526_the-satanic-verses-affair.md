His novel, The Satanic Verses, had sparked riots across the Muslim world. The ailing religious leader of Iran, the Ayatollah Khomeini, had invoked a little-known religious opinion - a fatwa - and effectively sentenced Rushdie to death.\r This film looks back on the extraordinary events which followed the publication of the book and the ten year campaign to get the fatwa lifted. Interviews with Rushdie's friends and family and testimony from leaders of Britain's Muslim community and the Government reveal the inside story of the affair.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vcUcIfgOGyAAL7xs7OjnRv7WOn5.jpg", "actors": ["Salman Rushdie (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
