The first sequel is, as most sequels, less attractive. As the charming mix of Germans and Austrians itself wasn't new and interesting any more, Schwabenitzky had to concentrate more on the less terrific elements. He emphasised the character-clich\u00e9s and made up a more complex story, in order to bring down as many of the characters from the first film as possible.  This sequel is only worth watching if you're a great fan of the first part. Actually, not even then.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vJqpUWHTX1Vb5pvvbZbz2fNQRJN.jpg", "actors": ["Elfi Eschke (Henriette 'Henny' Sch\u00f6nberg)", "Andreas Vit\u00e1sek (Siegfried 'Sigi' Hirnschroth)", "Claudia Kment (Renate Hirnschroth)", "Nicola Etzelstorfer (Julia Hirnschroth)", "Hans Clarin (Uwe Sch\u00f6nberg)", "Ingrid van Bergen (Siglinde von Platt)", "Alexander Goebel (Dr. Peter Sommer)", "Dietmar Sch\u00f6nherr (Dr. Hofbauer)", "Maresa H\u00f6rbiger (Familienrichterin Hertha Pietsch)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
