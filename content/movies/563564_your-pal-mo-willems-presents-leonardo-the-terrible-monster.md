No matter how hard he tries, he can't seem to frighten anyone. Determined to succeed, Leonardo sets himself to training and research. Finally, he finds a nervous little boy, and scares the tuna salad out of him! But scaring people isn't quite as satisfying as he thought it would be. Leonardo realizes that he might be a terrible, awful monster-but he could be a really good friend.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/djHo9tNEMmykPZ7paGyn4uJwDIo.jpg", "actors": ["Mo Willems (voice)", "Joey Stack (Sam (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
