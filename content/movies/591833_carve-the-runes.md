They travel through Scotland, wrestling with Oz's impending death, Cai's estrangement from his wife, and how climate change is affecting the world around them - and searching for answers through poetry, nature, and their own bond. In 2008, Isaac had an infection that almost killed him, and eventually resulted in him having to undergo a second kidney transplant. We understood that our bond, that life, may be more tenuous than we had realized. We vowed to spend more time working together on projects. 'Carve The Runes' is the result of these efforts.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
