Works only as the sort of thing you have on in the background, only gracing with your attentions for the brief golden moments Pumpkinhead is doing his thing.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}, {"pseudo": "Wuchak", "content": "***Lower budget than the original, but better story & characters***  \r\n\r\nA gang of partying teens stumble across an old witch\u2019s cabin in rural Southern Cal and foolishly unleash a vengeful demon linked to a dead feral boy.\r\n\r\n\"Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings\" (1993) was released to video and therefore has noticeably inferior production values to its 1988 predecessor. It was shot in three weeks for less than $1 million and you can tell, but it has a more compelling script and arguably better characters with the exception of the absent Lance Hendriksen, who will return for the next two sequels as a ghost.\r\n\r\nWithout Hendriksen and any references to the original flick, this is more of a standalone reimagining containing all the staples of the first film: a group of teens, rural Southern Cal, a mysterious cabin in the woods, an ugly witch, a revenge-based plot and, of course, Pumpkinhead itself. Speaking of whom, the creature looks formidable despite the low-budget, albeit kinda artificial.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, striking blonde Ami Dolenz and petite cutie Soleil Moon Frye are on hand on the feminine front, but not enough is done with them.\r\n\r\nBottom line: Despite the low budget, I prefer this one to the original and \u201cPumpkinhead 4: Blood Feud\u201d (2007). I can\u2019t remember \u201cAshes to Ashes\u201d (2006) at this particular moment, which isn\u2019t a good sign, lol (I think I saw it, but I\u2019m not sure).\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 28 minutes and was shot in Santa Clarita, California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+/B- (5.5/10)"}], "recommandations_id": [35978, 26515, 38499, 28859], "youtube_key": "FM8eFxhw5o4"}
