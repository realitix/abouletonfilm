Because he hasn't done any films lately since 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' critically failed. His role was awesome, but a struggling young single father. When he loses his inherited family house to the bank, he has no choice but to make a quick decision that can secure his family a roof over the head. But when the things get ugly, the new issues begin to appear, and with a narrow chance he tries to fix it.\r\n\r\nAnother excellent character in the movie that played by Michael Shannon. Not like you know this story very well, and wonderfully narrated story on the screen about what a desperate man can do with his small opportunity to rise again. You will know the twist is coming, but when and how is what we have to patiently wait for. I almost liked the entire film, except the end, which was a bit weak solution and stronger in the display.\r\n\r\n8/10"}], "recommandations_id": [271714, 245703, 244509, 241239], "youtube_key": "sfttvNCIJvE"}
