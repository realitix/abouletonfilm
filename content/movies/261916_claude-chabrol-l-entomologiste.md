In a peaceful residence near the Loire River, Chabrol raised his favorite characters : monsters.

Excerpts from The Butcher (Le Boucher), Violette Nozi\u00e8re, The Hatter's Ghost (Les Fant\u00f4mes du chapelier) and Masks (Masques) will punctuate their meaningful and witty conversation.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Claude Chabrol (Himself)", "Jean Douchet (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
