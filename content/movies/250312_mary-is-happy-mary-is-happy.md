With graduation a few months away, she is faced with sudden changes in life, love, and friendship. Meanwhile, strange events begin to happen to her that seem completely random and without reason. She struggles to make sense of her life as it threatens to spin out of control.  The narrative of an uncontrollable life derives from the artistic concept of the project, which is to adapt a Twitter stream into a fictional film. The director uses 410 real Tweets from an anonymous girl as a springboard to create a fantasy world of a contemporary Asian teenager.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jmKSWybRPomuBc4Thf68lxUoxDP.jpg", "actors": ["Patcha Poonpiriya (Mary)", "Thanapob Leeratanakajorn (Pakorn)", "Chonnikan Netjui (Suri)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [178929, 244970, 109048, 121522], "youtube_key": "drF1c-IbNVI"}
