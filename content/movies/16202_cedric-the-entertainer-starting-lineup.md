Cedric himself takes on topics such as Bill Clinton, the death penalty, reality television, fast-food chicken, church etiquette, and much more. The other comedians are a mixed lot: Roland Powell amusingly mocks insecure boyfriends and sings a singles bar pick-up song and Juan Villareal gets some laughs out of food stamps and The Blair Witch Project, while Tony Luewellyn flounders through weak material about Ex-Lax and the war on terror. Then along comes J.J., who gives a surreal spin to roadkill and giving birth to septuplets.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4dTtjIPEbLQ7D3u7CbDhMyP8pez.jpg", "actors": ["Cedric the Entertainer (Himself)", "Roland Powell (Himself)", "Juan Villareal (Himself)", "Tony Luewellyn (Himself)", "Conrad Goode (Slave)", "Nema Williams (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
