Ironically, Portia herself had once had an affair with Earle's father, powerful publisher John Condon (Clarence Kolb). She has a pretty good idea of what is going on in Elizabeth's head, since she herself was on the verge of killing Condon when he ruthlessly took custody of her illegitimate son (not Earle, though that certainly would have brought things full circle). As Portia toils and strains to free her client, she carries on a romance with Dan Foster (Walter Abel) -- the attorney for the prosecution. LA Law and The Practice have nothing on this one!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lIeRVWUQ0fa2inqRhnq89J3P9YS.jpg", "actors": ["Walter Abel (Dan Foster)", "Frieda Inescort (Portia Merriman)", "Neil Hamilton (Earle Condon)", "Heather Angel (Elizabeth Manners)", "Ruth Donnelly (Jane Wilkins)", "Barbara Pepper (Evelyn)", "Clarence Kolb (John Condon)", "Anthony Marsh (Richard Conlan)", "Paul Stanton (Judge)", "George Cooper (Efe)", "John Kelly (Hank)", "Hobart Bosworth (Governor)", "Ian Maclaren (Father Caslez)", "Chick Chandler (Barker)", "Bob Murphy (Inspector)", "Inez Palange (Mrs. Gannow)", "Leo Gorcey (Joe Gannow)", "Huntley Gordon (Dr. Thorndike)", "Marion Ballou (Mrs. Manners)", "Hooper Atchley (Jack Madden)", "Nat Carr (1st Committeeman)", "Lucie Kaye (Switchboard Operator)", "Jack Baxley (Juror)", "Brooks Benedict (Portia's Co-Counsel)", "Lynton Brent (Reporter)", "Allan Cavan (Richard Conlon's Doctor)", "Frank Dae (Head of Disbarment Committee)", "Sayre Dearing (Prosecution Co-Counsel)", "Jack Deery (Major Greenwood)", "Dick Gordon (Party Guest)", "Sherry Hall (Bailiff)", "Carl M.
