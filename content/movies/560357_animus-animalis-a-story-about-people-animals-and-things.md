Our vanity is given something to mirror itself in, but does not escape without a scratch or two in this documentary, which observes a taxidermist, a deer farmer and a museum curator at work. Three jobs that have one thing in common: turning animals into aesthetic objects, alive as well as dead. When the work is done properly, it is impossible to tell the difference. Dead pets are mummified. At the zoological museum, the animals' glassy eyes stare back at us from the showcases. Even a plastic alligator has its natural place in the human master plan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2wnygG5RRbgVAtiamETHqAlkuxG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "TTPU7p14iVs"}
