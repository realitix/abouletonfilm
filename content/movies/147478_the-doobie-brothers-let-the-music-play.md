Worn out by non-stop touring and internal disagreements the band broke up after a farewell concert in 1982. There were sporadic reunions in the eighties before the band reformed permanently in the early nineties and have continued touring and recording ever since. This new film features contributions from all the surviving key band members, their manager Bruce Cohn and long term producer Ted Templeman to tell the full story of the band's highs and lows through four decades of musical evolution.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7WnFJidE7GJvRSyfxPRGTMxVQn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
