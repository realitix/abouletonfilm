It's a costume piece with wardrobe mostly from the Garden of Eden. Annette Haven is outrageously beautiful and maddeningly alluring, and even if this outstandingly humorous and sexy movie was filmed two centuries ago, it would still be a hit", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1ShhPxbwY14Vn35C3OzAegcpjLe.jpg", "actors": ["Annette Haven (Martha Washington)", "John Holmes (Captain John Smith)", "Angela Haze (Girl with Ben Franklin)", "Abigail Clayton (Missy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
