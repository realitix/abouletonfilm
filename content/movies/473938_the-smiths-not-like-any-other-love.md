In this half-hour Culture Show special, fellow Mancunian and lifelong fan Tim Samuels sets out to find out why The Smiths have such a special place in the hearts of a generation of Brits. The Smiths were only around for five years in the mid-eighties, but to this day the sentiment their music evokes is strong. Samuels pays visits to a variety of dedicated fans including fashion designer Wayne Hemingway, poet Simon Armitage, Labour MP Kerry McCarthy and Oasis songwriter Noel Gallagher to analyse the look, the lyrics, the issues and the riffs that made The Smiths Britain's first, and arguably best ever, indie rock band.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wZiBiuYuYyDsrVIlUS4Xj3n48Hz.jpg", "actors": ["Morrissey (Self)", "Johnny Marr (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
