The nerve-killing duel with Phil Mickelson at Royal Troon in the Open Championship 2016 is already a golf classics, and when expert G\u00f6ran Zachrisson, who had been in place at 50 British Open openings, saw his countryman win he could not hold back the tears.  Now the golfer and expert have met again to relive the magic moment. At a cinema in Gothenburg, they go through the last round battle for battle. It offers beautiful anecdotes, but is also serious - when Stenson tells how he played for his friend who died just days before Stenson went to the first round of Royal Troon. The film also travels back to Royal Troon, to meet those who were behind the scenes on the historic day. Stenson looks forward to the British Open 2017, hoping for a new victory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9YActZCPtpgEfN60SE96w33j3r0.jpg", "actors": ["Henrik Stenson (Himself)", "Phil Mickelson (Himself)", "G\u00f6ran Zachrisson (Interviewer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
