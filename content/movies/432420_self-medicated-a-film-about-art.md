Begun in bars and clubs of the Lower East Side, the movement promoted lesser-known works by up-and-coming talent. Over the last thirteen years the Antagonist Movement has grown and expanded from its base in New York to show in cities around the world, including Berlin, Lisbon, and Quito. This film documents the entire history of the Antagonist Movement and the artists involved, employing animation, stop-motion film techniques, interviews, and a killer soundtrack that spans the globe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wU9SwUtN1O8RALl8WxFST0fpzhQ.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Allen (Himself)", "Raul Ayala ()", "Richard Allen ()", "Mike Cohen ()", "Timothy Danger ()", "Shannon Marie Daugherty ()", "Jos\u00e9 Luis J\u00e1come Guerrero ()", "Ethan H.
