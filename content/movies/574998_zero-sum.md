Ruth removes the tube and as the searing pain subsides, her memory begins to return. She looks out of the window and sees hundreds of identical ships orbiting a green planet. Ruth remembers the pledge she made to begin a new life, light years away from the earth. Suddenly there's a noise from the other side of a dividing screen and Ruth realises that she's not alone.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o0WegWyvfkkPs8xuxh4ozzZeLWD.jpg", "actors": ["Aimee-Ffion Edwards (Ruth Sharman)", "Phil Davis (Neumann)", "Poppy Pedder (Ruth Double (uncredited body double for Aimee-Ffion Edwards))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
