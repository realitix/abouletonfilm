Using a kaleidoscopic array of experimental techniques, this film explores uranium mining in Canada and its destructive effects on both the environment and the women working in the mines. A plethora of images ranging from the women at work to spine-chilling representations of cancerous bodies are accompanied by unnerving industrial sounds and straightforward information from some of the women.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fw1VLfHDqj15qavQi4zqp2se1Jd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
