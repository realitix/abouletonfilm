The film is a synthesis of both abstract and figurative imagery, analysis and commentary, writing and multiple languages, multi-layered sounds and music, lyrical and contrapuntal relationships, and elaborate animated compositions. The film plays with the thresholds of change between intuition and analytical thinking, as well as between what is read or heard as \"figurative\" or \"abstract.\" The various animation sequences range from pure geometric abstraction to symbols, metaphors and icons (boxing ring, car, chair, airplanes, steps).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/NPrHWCZYdOjzJPtDmDVZxBGhiL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
