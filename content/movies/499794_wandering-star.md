Gracia follows Los Fiambres vocalist Rober Perdut more than thirty years later. He meets a photographer for a photo session in a bus station, is looking for drugs and loses someone named Roni (Rober\u2019s surname does not coincidentally mean \u2018disappeared, lost\u2019). Rober sniffs coke from a Johnny Cash CD and is sailed to an island. In other scenes, we follow the photographer, who sometimes disappears mysteriously.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3DiPH9kz09D2kVACyAoUzXNchJ7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
