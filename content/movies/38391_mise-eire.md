In the poem, Pearse personifies Ireland as an old woman whose glory is past and who has been sold by her children. The poem inspired this 1959 film of the same name by George Morrison. Here, Morrison painstakingly assembled historical footage of the events surrounding the 1916 Rising from archives across Europe and deals with key figures and events in Irish Nationalism between the 1890s and the 1910s. The narration is by Liam Budhlaeir and Padraig O'Raghallaigh and the musical score is by Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riada.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5I4HZaJt8q7lYBUjfGC2tebxn60.jpg", "actors": ["Liam Budhlaeir (Narrator)", "Padraig O'Raghallaigh (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
