The Portal is intended as an abstract gateway to the mind, body and soul elements of existence. Each of these are depicted by an arm on the Portal, each with it's own individual visual contribution of binary code and morphing texture maps. The result is a 2 minute journey, in, through and around The Portal.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
