A group of young surfers from Australia and South Africa sacrificed everything and put it all on the line to create a sport, a culture, and an industry that is today worth billions of dollars and has captured the imagination of the world. With a radical new approach and a brash colonial attitude, these surfers crashed headlong into a culture that was not ready for revolution. Surfing was never to be the same again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oj92NVzcXkLzIVu5YPFJieLX65V.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
