The film opens with young, pretty Maki (Natsuo Ishido) luring a drunken salariman into a parking lot only to be mugged by Maki's brother, Shinji (played by former child star Mitsunori Isaki). Unfortunately, the drunk proves to be no ordinary working stiff, but a gangster who takes a dim view of petty crime.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wYKAI8SH3r7l6CA0hj0o1OpDFji.jpg", "actors": ["Mamiko Aso ()", "Mitsunori Isaki ()", "Natsuo Ishido ()", "Junji Takada ()", "Shinichi Tsutsumi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
