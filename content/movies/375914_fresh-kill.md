Shareen salvages refuse with her pickup truck while Claire waits tables at the hip Naga Saki restaurant in Manhattan, caught up in a global exchange of industrial waste via contaminated sushi. As a ghost barge bearing nuclear refuse circles the planet in search of a willing port, household pets begin to glow ominously and then disappear; people start speaking in tongues. The crisis escalates when a multinational corporation is implicated, the couple's daughter Honey mysteriously vanishes, and a group of young New Yorkers strike back in an unlikely alliance with activists in the developing world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cuBPiTcVyZ40MUGyHvy4xs9YUEx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
