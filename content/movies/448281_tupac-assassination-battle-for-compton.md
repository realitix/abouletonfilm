The previous installments was TUPAC ASSASSINATION and TUPAC ASSASSINATION II: THE RECKONING (revised, rereleased and repackaged as TUPAC AFTERMATH).\r\n\r\nNow that said, this is still not a great piece of documentarial work. In fact the editing is still not that good, I do believe that Richard Bond should have left the editing to the proffesionals.\r\n\r\nVery often you are given information in form of written text and audio, and some of these times the information is different from the other so you have to be able to not only read and process what is said in written form while simultaniously processing whatever the person interviewed is saying.\r\n\r\nWhich makes it a bit confusing at times and you kind of have to add 1 and 1 together to get what they are trying to say with the documentary and instead of digging deeper and deeper into some information that seems important they instead just jump to the next thin on their mind.\r\n\r\nAs expected a bunch of the clips in the video are reused footage from the previous Tupac Assassination films and interviews that Jesse Surratt (aka J Mix) made for his youtube-channel which is dedicated to the life of Tupac and people that knew him (who got a producer slot on this film) and from other stuff.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is they add a couple things that are pointless to the subject really, like for instance they talk about there being disputes within Death Row.\r\n\r\nWhich is fine and all but some examples they give are really stupid, like for instance they have an interview with Crooked I talking about how there was a DVD made by the Crips dissing Death Row.\r\n\r\nAnd they make it look like this happened in 1996. First off, DVD's didn't exist in 1996. Secondly the DVD in question is a DVD called THA ROW KILLA which wasn't released until 2003, many many years after both Big and Pac had been dead and is completely irrelevant to anything in the documentary.\r\n\r\nAnd stuff of this nature, not too much of it luckily but some. And often names are spelled wrong and the like. So yeah needless to say it's a bit rough-handled.\r\n\r\nIt also pack in a segment where they discredit the documentary/book MURDER RAP which came out last year and people then saw as the gospel of how it all went down. But learning my own experience from watching BIGGIE AND TUPAC by Nick Broomfield when it came out and thinking that Suge Knight was the man behind the killing for many years (to later realise that that was pretty dumb) I knew better than to jump to any conclusions that time around. Especially considering the fishy circumstances of the interview of the alleged driver of the shooting (which was really the only 'proof' that documentary offered).\r\n\r\nAnyway just like the documentary I'm straying a bit away from the topic here, but yeah it's a decent watch. But if you don't have any background information on Death Row records, Tupac Shakur etc etc you'll probably not understand half of what is being talked about. And even then it will probably be a bit confusing... That said, the theory given is a pretty interesting one."}], "recommandations_id": []}
