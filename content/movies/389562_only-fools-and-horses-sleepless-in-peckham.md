The Trotters need money to stave off being evicted but are saved when it transpires that Uncle Albert invested his savings wisely and leaves them almost a quarter of a million pounds. Del tells Rodney that his real father was not Reg Trotter but a flash local crook called Freddie 'the Frog' Robdal. Cassandra goes into labour, this time successfully and her baby girl is named Joan after Del and Rodney's mother and with whose spirit the brothers go to commune.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ckmvPFYnG6TS0yyS2YiJpNjmaWZ.jpg", "actors": ["David Jason (Derek 'Del Boy' Trotter)", "Nicholas Lyndhurst (Rodney Trotter)", "Tessa Peake-Jones (Raquel Turner)", "Gwyneth Strong (Cassandra Trotter)", "John Challis (Boycie)", "Sue Holderness (Marlene)", "Roger Lloyd Pack (Trigger)", "Paul Barber (Denzil)", "Roy Heather (Sid)", "Patrick Murray (Mickey Pearce)", "Peter Blythe (Mr Cartwright)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
