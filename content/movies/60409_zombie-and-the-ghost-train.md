After several months' sleeping on the streets of Istanbul, he returns to Helsinki where he's called into the army but discharged on mental health grounds after adding turpentine to the officers' soup. Zombie lives bleary-eyed in an apartment off his parents' house where his lonely, unemployed father suffers from heart disease. His girl-friend Marjo has taken up with a hairdresser but comes back to Zombie. His friend Harri hires him as a roadie for his band \"Harry and the Mulefukkers\" then gives him a chance as a bass player. He has his girl and he has a gig, but can Zombie put the bottle down?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5NUu1VycRGipz8dZxSUVeE2UFfD.jpg", "actors": ["Silu Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 (Zombie)", "Marjo Leinonen (Marjo)", "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4 (Harri)", "Vieno Saaristo (\u00c4iti)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [270002, 214349, 44589, 217632], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
