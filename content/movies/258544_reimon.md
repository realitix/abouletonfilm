Ramona lives in the suburbs of Buenos Aires. Every day she travels four hours and a half to reach her job and to get back home. She divides her working time between two upper middle-class homes where she receives the name of R\u00e9imon, a sound that evokes the English language, a Buenos Aires upper class snobbish custom.  It\u00b4s fiction and it\u00b4s not. It\u00b4s also a film about the labour conditions of a worker, about the time this worker uses for working and the efforts that implies working. It\u00b4s also about the absurdity of cleaning someone else\u00b4s house, the absurdity of modern life and the differences between social classes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xkGTa2hom0ub6pf6p5OKXpxVxl0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
