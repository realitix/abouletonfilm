Because of this unique trait, he has lived through many historical periods of Malaysia; from the colonial years to the Japanese invasion and Independence. Though some may consider it a gift, the man's long life can also be a curse as he has to face the reality of seeing the ones he loves die. A highlight of the film will be the changing landscape of Malaysia from the early days up to 2012.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rcoegZxCOOF9EwgnWGpy3edoSbN.jpg", "actors": ["Remy Ishak (Budi)", "Jojo Goh (Lily)", "Izzue Islam (Razak)", "Fizz Fairuz (Johan)", "Dian P.
