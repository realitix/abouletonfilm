More than 900 entries were submitted and from these contributions, R\u00f8hder Tvedt assembled a collage of beautiful everyday moments, personal confessions and kinetic bursts of dance and movement. As the film cycles through expressions of love, loneliness, joy and sorrow, patterns and connections appear and it becomes clear that Between Us is a film about how we relate to one another.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qWM6diGzD3IYZCTHqRq1x2dhaIi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
