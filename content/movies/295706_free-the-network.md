What does that mean? Most likely, it means one of a handful of telecommunications providers is middlemanning your information from Point A to Point B. Fire off an email or a tweet, broadcast a livestream or upload video to YouTube, and you\u2019re relying on vast networks of fiber optic cables deep underground and undersea, working with satellites high above, to move your data around the world, and to bring the world to your fingertips.  It\u2019s a story about big dreams and cloudy missions, about complex affiliations and what happens when a DIY hack-tech movement confronts the force of the state. But beyond that, it\u2019s a story about the incredibly high stakes of living networked in today\u2019s world. We all have skin in this game. Remember: You\u2019re on the Internet.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3RJzb47vk6E3YmcsgvaPUFmEpr2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
