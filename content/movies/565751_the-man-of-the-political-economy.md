The post-war recovery and high economic growth serve as the basis for him to achieve the breakup and privatisation of the electricity business. As a follower of Fukuzawa Yukichi, he inherited the spirit of independence, self-respect and the people. He rose up alone from the ruins of the war. It was the fight of an unconventional, stubborn old man over 70 with an indomitable will. Minister of Trade and Industry Ikeda Hayato admired Matsunaga like a father while Prime Ministers Yoshida Shigeru and Konoe Fumimaro, Shirasu Jiro (Takagawa Yuya) and others were in awe of his unfathomable passion.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Kotaro Yoshida (Matsunaga Yasuzaem)", "Shir\u00f4 It\u00f4 (Yoshida Shigeru)", "G\u00f4 Rij\u00fb (Konoe Fumimaro)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
