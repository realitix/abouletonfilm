Pedestrians shuffle across a bustling Beijing street, steelworkers linger outside a deserted factory, tourists laugh and scamper across a crowded beach, worshippers kneel to pray in a remote village. With a painterly eye for composition, Wang captures China as he sees it, calling to a temporary halt a land in a constant state of change.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vnYE6x5DAB7Rc2NRUcAM6au2bwe.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
