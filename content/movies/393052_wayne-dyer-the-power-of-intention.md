To accomplish this, Dr. Dyer takes the audience through a journey into the seven faces of intention - 1: creativity, 2: kindness; 3: love, 4: beauty, 5: expansiveness, 6: abundance, and 7: receptivity. Throughout the program, Dr. Dyer illustrates his points with signature stories that move the audience to tears--as well as abundant laughter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xKZ0hFpm5UysRk839c6ATqZlm9a.jpg", "actors": ["Wayne Dyer (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
