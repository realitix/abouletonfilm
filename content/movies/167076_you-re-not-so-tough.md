The idea of working never enters their minds until Halop is egged on by Grey to show his capabilities. Before long, he and Hall are working on the ranch of Galli, an elderly Italian woman who treats her workers like human beings instead of animals. Galli's son disappeared as an infant, and Halop tries to convince her that he is that long lost son, thus possibly sharing in her wealth. Galli is such a good person that Halop is soon motivated by respect instead of greed, so he devises a plan to help her when truckers and a labor organization band together to keep her crops from making it to market.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gPvOVG0R3CeAP7eLwyOZspJJtGQ.jpg", "actors": ["Billy Halop (Tommy Abraham Lincoln)", "Huntz Hall (Albert 'Pig')", "Gabriel Dell (String)", "Bernard Punsly (Ape)", "Bobby Jordan (Rap)", "Nan Grey (Millie)", "Rosina Galli (Mama Posito)", "Henry Armetta (Salvatore)", "Eddy Waller (Griswold)", "Harry Hayden (Lacey)", "Joe King (Collins)", "Arthur Loft (Marshall)", "Harris Berger (Jake)", "Frank Bischell (Third Worker)", "Hal E.
