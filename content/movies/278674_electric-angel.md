Combining the methods of \u201canimation\u201d and \u201clive action\u201d, this intricate work embodies the idea of an \u201cars combinatoria\u201d. The structure is loose, with neither a central axis nor a point where everything converges, contributing greatly to the open-ended character of the film, where rhythm is the key element.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mmLqwraf4uERjqRZyX3jl36epr6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
