Nonetheless the film is in no sense an animation work but rather a collection of mostly un-nameable shapes which gather round this recognizable iconography and visually dominate the image which repeats its, thus, ephemeral chase-and-catch increasingly closer, finally obliterating all but the \"jewels,\" the multiple coloring, referred to in the title.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fWouPlVJt9W1yK8bH9MA3JYNOS9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
