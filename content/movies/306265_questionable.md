In the age of cut-down high tops and late shove-its, the hellish Plan B roster (brought together by a visionary Mike Ternasky) rose above the transitional feel of the era by pioneering today's tech + handrail methodologies.  Shot lovingly with shouldered VHS dinosaurs and screw-on fisheyes, Questionable is an undoubtedly raw, homegrown, and pure skateboarding video that not only reflects a major turning point in skateboarding's evolution, but illuminates the path that the sport will follow over the next decade.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bAV7TM8LUAOhPvUQwLX7aYnzy1B.jpg", "actors": ["Pat Duffy (Himself)", "Colin McKay (Himself)", "Ryan Fabry (Himself)", "Sal Barbier (Himself)", "Sean Sheffey (Himself)", "Rodney Mullen (Himself)", "Mike Carroll (Himself)", "Danny Way (Himself)", "Rick Howard (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
