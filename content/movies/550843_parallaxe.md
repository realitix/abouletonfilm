Parallax \u2013 an effect by which the position of an object seems to change when it is looked at from different positions. Working on the concept of geometry and space in the cinema, from the planar space of the photogram to the stage of its representation, this project reveals a multi-faceted object. The different surfaces that circumscribe the screen, the movement of projectors on rails, the changes in projection angles and the simultaneous visions. Parallaxe emphasizes the transport of images and their ability to modify the perception that we have on a same reality. Associated with Michalis Moschoutis' direct sounding device, Nomino\u00eb's graphic images are deconstructed and their virtualities increased tenfold. Spatial sound diffusion immerses the audience in this multidimensional device, at once a movie set, movie theater and film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6zKTHaXwFSZ55SsmWxEUBL39Jkp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
