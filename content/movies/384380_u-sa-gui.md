The film depicts a macabre game played by two rabbits and a blindfolded woman. The rabbits face each other over an old-fashioned illustrated board game. When they land on a square, the woman must eat the food indicated in the illustration. If she has chosen correctly, a die pops out of her mouth and lands on the floor giving the rabbits their next move.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qpYGiz1BujkdJnNwMtPi0yrt2ha.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
