Dressed as waiters, Kapa and Pepe awake in the bronze chariot of the millennial sculpture group. They drive along the Danube promenade, and on the concrete reinforcement of the demolished Budapest rondella hotel they get involved in a showdown of political background. In the burnt-down Sports Hall the waiters train for a last supper, Pepe and Kapa run around the big laid table with trays in their hands. While doing so, Pepe keeps crying out: \"I am the best one, I am the most beautiful one, I am the king, I am the god...\" Sitting in a boat on the Danube, a ship goes past them, and the Niagara falls, majestic and breathtaking, resound in their ears. On each passing away something new will come to life \u2013 as rapped by Sub Bass Monster.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6H3XFbqCMxrLT2P3GSDDDqjPsiI.jpg", "actors": ["Zolt\u00e1n Mucsi (Kapa)", "P\u00e9ter Scherer (Pepe)", "Szarvas J\u00f3zsef (J\u00f3zsi)", "Istv\u00e1n M\u00e1rton (Pista)", "Enik\u0151 B\u00f6rcs\u00f6k (Enik\u0151)", "Emese Vasv\u00e1ri (Emese)", "Lajos Ott\u00f3 Horv\u00e1th (Minister)", "Zsolt Kov\u00e1cs (Zsolt)", "J\u00e1nos Gyuriska  (Minister's aid)", "Judit Schell (Judit)", "Roland R\u00e1ba (Roland)", "Korn\u00e9l Mundrucz\u00f3 (Korn\u00e9l)", "Laura Ruttkay (Laura)", "Bal\u00e1zs Galk\u00f3 (Galk\u00f3)", "Mikl\u00f3s Jancs\u00f3 (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [104515, 105283, 40987], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
