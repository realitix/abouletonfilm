There are generally two kinds of porn documentaries--those that actually take an insightful look behind the scenes, and those that are just an excuse to show a lot of nudity and XXX porn footage. This is actually somewhere in between. It's generously seasoned with porn footage, but there are also a lot of (fully-clothed) interviews, and they even talk to the owners of porn theaters, some typical porn customers (including some pre-adolescent boys who are walking by the the theater--I wonder what their parents thought of that?), as well as a guy who makes promotional billboards for porn movies although he claims never to have seen one!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aTnBbE5TsIvmMXTjwRNtxsgxTKa.jpg", "actors": ["Beno\u00eet Archenoul (Himself)", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Barral (Herself)", "Claudine Beccarie (Herself)", "Fran\u00e7oise Beccarie (Herself)", "Sylvia Bourdon (Herself)", "Jean-Christophe Bouvet (Himself)", "Marie-Christine Chireix (Herself)", "Jocelyne Clairis (Herself)", "Michel Dauba (Himself)", "Jack Gatteau (Himself)", "B\u00e9atrice Harnois (Herself)", "Claude Janna (Herself)", "Liliane Allan (Herself)", "Corinne Lemoine (Herself)", "Richard Allan (Himself (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
