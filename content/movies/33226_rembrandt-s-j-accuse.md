Greenaway explains the background, the context, the conspiracy, the murder and the motives of all its 34 painted characters who have conspired to kill for their combined self-advantage. Greenaway leads us through Rembrandt's paintings into 17th century Amsterdam. He paints a world that is democratic in principle, but is almost entirely ruled by twelve families. The notion exists of these regents as charitable and compassionate beings. However, reality was different.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t4Lnp5Kf7UPdDDd4823MDPb8hqo.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Greenaway (Himself / Public Prosecutor)", "Martin Freeman (Rembrandt)", "Eva Birthistle (Saskia)", "Jodhi May (Geertje)", "Emily Holmes (Hendrickje)", "Jonathan Holmes (Ferdinand Bol)", "Michael Teigen (Carel Fabritius)", "Natalie Press (Marieke)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [56816], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
