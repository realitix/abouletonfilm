Creating physical experience that transcends the autonomous object and cinematic medium, filmmaker Mika Rottenberg guides us through elaborately constructed physical and metaphysical environments. All activities converge in a Harlem bingo hall where a sequence of numbers opens mechanic portals into an alternate reality. Here, the relationship of cause and effect obeys bizarre laws and characters linked by invisible forces engage in a parapsychological chain of events. These actions move planets, influence global temperature, and shift architecture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7smVbPtlUxRCNqThpkoTspocZVq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
