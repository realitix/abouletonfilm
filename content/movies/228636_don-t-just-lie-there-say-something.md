A British Government Minister puts forward a bill to battle filth in the UK but that doesn't stop him having an affair with both his secretary, Miss Parkyn and Wendy, the wife of a high-up reporter. Opponents to the bill - mainly some hippy girls, lead by Johnny, kidnap the Minister's best friend and co-founder of the bill, Barry Ovis just as he was getting married to his fiancee, Joan. Barry escapes, just before the police raid the hippies hiding place - to claim that Ovis was in a orgy and get the bill defeated - and dashes back to his and Joan's flat followed by Inspector Ruff, who is investigating the kidnap and Damina, one of the hippies. Meanwhile, the Minister is also trying to use the flat to carry on his affairs with both Wendy and Miss Parkyn. The Minister, Barry &amp; Joan tries to keep the truth from Ruft, Wilfred Potts, an old and honest MP, Birdie, the Minister's wife and stop the hippies, and this causes no end of trouble.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9JlyldN2xzbvJEQxGApYxnk0yV6.jpg", "actors": ["Leslie Phillips (Minister)", "Brian Rix (Barry Ovis)", "Joan Sims (Birdie)", "Joanna Lumley (Miss Parkyn)", "Derek Royle (Potts)", "Peter Bland (Inspector Ruff)", "Myra Frances (Jean)", "Katy Manning (Damina)", "Barrie Gosney (Police Sergeant)", "Diane Langton (Angie)", "Nicola Rowley (Donna)", "Arnold Diamond (Priest)", "Derek Griffiths (Johnny)", "Peter Greenwell (1st Party Guest)", "Corbet Woodall (Newsreader)", "Louisa Martin (Principal Bridesmaid)", "Aubrey Woods (T.V.
