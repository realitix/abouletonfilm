No human words are spoken here. Rather, the sights and sounds of Christmas are presented in a visual feast of whimsical, happy scenes accompanied by seasonal music. From sledding and snowmen to glowing candles and shimmering ornaments, dozens of animated and live-action settings communicate the beauty and wonder of the holiday season. Penguin puppets unwrap presents, ring bells, and toss tinsel. Santa's sleigh in a gentle snowfall segues smoothly into a playful group of Christmas-clad youngsters dancing to Tchaikovsky's \"Nutcracker.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cOqqKUPXmnzVD1aoYl9Ko8CjZK7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
