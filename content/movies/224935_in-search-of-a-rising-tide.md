It ended up a document for the preservation of a fishing culture amid the ecosystem that created it.  \u00a0  The Bonefish Culture of Andros Island, Bahamas \u2013 the island that holds the unofficial world record for a bonefish caught on a fly \u2013 had not been truly experienced from a native Bahamian\u2019s point of view, until now. Filmmaker Jamie Howard does this by hitching a ride on a boat bow, setting up impromptu interviews on lobster crates, and driving the roads of the Bahamas\u2019 least explored island. The driving force of the story is the fishing reunion of two of the best guides in the world, Andy Smith and Charlie Neymour. It is a fishing trip that for them had not occurred since childhood.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5m7Tl7Ux10B7DjPdTu40PQ4MRrQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
