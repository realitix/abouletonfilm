The parody purports to be a \u201clost Italian film\u201d by Alrugo Entertainment, an Australian film-making collective formed by Dario Russo, Tait Wilson, David Ashby, Will Spartalis and Boris Repasky.  Ostensibly an Italian take on the comic book superhero Spider-Man, the film is a reference to foreign movies that misappropriate popular American superheroes such as the Turkish film \u201c3 Dev Adam\u201d and the Japanese TV series \u201cSpider-Man\u201d, both of which alter the character of Spider-Man for foreign audiences. Other notable entries include the Indian version of Superman (1987), I Fantastici Tre Supermen (3 Fantastic Supermen) (1967) and La Mujer Murcielago (The Batwoman) (1968). It also resembles the movie The Bathman dal pianeta Eros (1982).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yqneLCJJPg9iD376NgA3mlmCbQ1.jpg", "actors": ["David Ashby ()", "Chris Asimos ()", "Anna Cashman ()", "Michael Crisci ()", "Matt Crook ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [42872, 28942], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
