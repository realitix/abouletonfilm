Two years earlier, a historian had shown that Enric Marco wasn\u2019t the member of the Resistance he had claimed to be, and that he\u2019d made up the stories of his experiences in a concentration camp that he had been recounting on television for years. Now, Marco retraces the route of his 1941 train journey as part of a convoy of workers sent by Franco to Hitler, in the middle of the Second World War.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n4HCI4tNw368mhjP6QnVGcrjItN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [482564, 345901, 530049, 450338], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
