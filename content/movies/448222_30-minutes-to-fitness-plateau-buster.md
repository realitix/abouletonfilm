Kelly Coffey also features easily-intensified exercises that let you increase the weight or impact levels as you get stronger. The programs are very straight-forward. The aerobic intervals range from high-impact jumping jacks to low-impact repeaters (sometimes holding dumbbells to maximize fat-burning). The toning intervals are exceptionally time-efficient. They feature compound exercises where you're working multiple muscle groups at once (fast-changing, usually only 12 reps per routine). As always, Kelly's cuing is friendly and positive. DVD includes a short bonus stretch segment. Requires two sets of dumbbells (e.g. 5 and 10 lb.)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xZJzDYGkqFz05tpZ4xwss5ObwHC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
