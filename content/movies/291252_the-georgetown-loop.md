The original film depicts a journey shot from the cab of a train passing through the Colorado Rockies, and, in this hypnotic new form, comes to suggest the movement of consciousness itself. Writes Jacobs: \"I've called it the first landscape film deserving of an X-rating, and that it is, yet its secret subtitle is \u2014 I must whisper \u2014 (Celestial Railway).\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4pasGNvUQbEvfQSeu4AZq25Rf7V.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
