Some of them are optimistic, some heartbreaking, but all reveal a much bigger fact of life: that the love of parents to their children is stronger than any other thing. The movie, which is emotional and sensitive, is lead by Assi Azar, one of the rising TV stars in Israel, a screen writer and the host of the Israeli version of \"Big Brother\".
