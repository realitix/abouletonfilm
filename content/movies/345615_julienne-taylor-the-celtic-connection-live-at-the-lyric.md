The concert blu-ray was filmed for release in late 2012. Compared to the likes of Norah Jones and Eva Cassidy, she's captured the hearts of many (with a especially large following in Asia) with her romantic Celtic folk and pop songs. Featured hits on this video are some of her famous hits from her album \"\"The Heart Within\"\" and some traditional Scottish folk songs along with her own compositions and interpretations of classic lovesongs included on her debut album \"\"A Time For Love\"\" which some of it have been featured in a number of Korea TV dramas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8v1xNJeyLLoJMlbG0KkXKsXBiEr.jpg", "actors": ["Julienne Taylor (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
