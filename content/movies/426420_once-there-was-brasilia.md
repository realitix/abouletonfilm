As the political capital of the country, and especially as one of the most symbolic utopias of the Brazilian twentieth century, the city of Brazilia shares the protagonism with a couple of renegades who survive by wandering marginally waiting for personal and collective redemption. To the fourth film, after the multi-award-winning White Out, Black In (2014), Adirley Queir\u00f3s returns to explore the vicissitudes of Brazilian society.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g1q8azglqHJyPhVkRDSTk6H7Vee.jpg", "actors": ["Wellington Abreu (WA4)", "Marquim do Tropa (Marquim)", "Andreia Vieira (Andreia)", "Franklin Ferreira (Pancillax)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
