Lucien (Jean-Pierre Kalfon) also accompanies them. There, Alexandre meets the strange lady-oracle Sonia (Lauren Bacall). As the film opens, the melancholy Alexandre is visited by the sensuous actress Laure (Arielle Dombasle) and her producer Raoul Fillipi (Karl Zero) who is going to make a movie of one of Alexandre's best-loved books. Laure is determined to play the part of the heroine and is willing to resort to seduction to get it. At the same time, Ariane is involved in a passionate affair with French-Mexican seismologist Carlo (Xavier Beauvois). While all of these characters wrangle and tangle with their different agendas, the local residents prepare for a violent revolution. ~ Sandra Brennan, Rovi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nuoZw4YccOZa9XSACCMd91mYG0S.jpg", "actors": ["Alain Delon (Alexandre)", "Lauren Bacall (Sonia)", "Xavier Beauvois (Carlo)", "Arielle Dombasle (Laure)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
