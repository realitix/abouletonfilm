Because he feels inferior to his wife, he begins to suspect her of infidelity and to think that she will one day elope with a lover. After a misunderstanding, Sarathy and his mother are estranged which further weakens the bond between Sarathy and Karthika. How Sarathy resolves his issues and gets back together with Karthika forms the rest of the story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/joJuxH1kOAz8MCQf16RZfmBfFNz.jpg", "actors": ["Karunas (Sarathy Raman)", "Karthika Mathew (Sarathy's wife)", "Nassar ()", "M.
