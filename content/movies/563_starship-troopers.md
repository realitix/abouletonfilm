Near Kubrick-ian in its wartime satire, _Starship Troopers_ is, before it is anything else, fun.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._"}, {"pseudo": "Zamomin", "content": "##No time for regrets in the fury of battle\r\nAgain and again there are undertones in this movie that show us that the situation is not as simple as the leaders of the world portrayed in the film might want their underlings to believe. A reporter asks the question whether the humans were the ones who started the war and whether the Arachnids are simply acting in self-defense. A talk show guest finds the idea that there could be intelligent Arachnids preposterous, showing how much the propaganda has done to degrade the enemy. In a great scene we see the eye of one of the arachnids for the first time and for a second I was wondering what was going on inside the creature. Of course, this brief moment of reflection is quickly erased by a gun shot and the continuation of the fury of war.\r\n\r\nBut this, to me, seems to add to the overall anti-war message: The soldiers can only stay obedient servants if they are not given moments to reflect and question the system. And so when the viewer see the propaganda clip at the very end of the movie proclaiming triumphantly and bombastically \"They'll fight and they'll win\", they might have already forgotten that just a moment ago they saw a sentient being being tortured in the name of this promised glorious victory."}], "recommandations_id": [861, 5548, 106, 36955]}
