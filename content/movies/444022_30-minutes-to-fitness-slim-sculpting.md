It's important to note that using a kettlebell really does amp up the workout! Both workouts require great form and precise execution: there are no over-the-top positions and no over-stressing impact on the joints. All the controlled moves demonstrated are geared toward slimming down your hips and outer thighs, trimming your waistline, tightening your glutes, sculpting your arms and burning lots of calories! But remember: form is crucial! Because the selection of exercises target each muscle group without over-taxing your body, these workouts fit in nicely with my philosophy that everyone should train smarter!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Kelly Coffey-Meyer ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
