At the crossroads of Europe and Asia, it amassed more gold than both continents combined, and safeguarded Christendom's most sacred relics, including the True Cross and heads of the Apostles. The largest walls ever created protected Istanbul's treasures from endless waves of invaders. Immerse yourself in the city that has endured more warfare than any other place on Earth: Istanbul.
