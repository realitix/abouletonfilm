Central characters in the narrative are Hermes, in the form of a seal, and Pegasus the mythological horse, both bearing witness to the voyage of the imagination, unhindered by the straight jacket of history and time. The animation has a dual meaning; it is both symbolic meditation on a journey into the unknown through the eyes of Pegasus and the seal, both hoping to heal wounds and create a sense of unity in their universe and also an exploration of the geographical history of the Thames and Rhine, which 10,000 years ago formed one single river.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Ag3BqofU9gsrIqtUNkbI4fb7Kbj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
