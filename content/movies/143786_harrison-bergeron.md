Nobody was smarter than anybody else. Nobody was better looking than anybody else. Nobody was stronger than anybody else, quicker than anybody else. All this equality was due to the 211th, 212th &amp; 213th amendments to the Constitution and the unceasing vigilance of the agents of the United States Handicapper General.
