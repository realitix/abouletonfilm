Nick Fenton and Peter Strickland, unique voices in their own right, film Bj\u00f6rk live in performance and punctuate her music with evocative animation and science and nature footage. The infinitely creative journey presents a culmination of work that represents one of the most original musical endeavors of a generation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yk23JNV3DbzCs2uBLG3BdD6qzpw.jpg", "actors": ["Bj\u00f6rk (Herself)", "David Attenborough (Himself - Opening sequence voice)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [324436, 214170, 29460], "youtube_key": "ZOlaf_Hk7n4"}
