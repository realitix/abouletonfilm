He is given three telegrams, one of which is for the president of the Camber of Deputies. Excited, Antoine runs his bicycle into a truck and loses the telegrams. What follows is an amusing and agonizing search for the missing messages. He is assisted first by a glum, wise-beyond-her-years little girl, Amelie; an off-duty police superintendent, a schoolmaster, a cookie-tin maker and a fireman. The harmonica musical theme is played by Flore Falvey.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cgDXpXgLqWGINfEvHze7eawjMUB.jpg", "actors": ["G\u00e9rard Gervais (Antoine Letourneur, le petit t\u00e9l\u00e9graphiste)", "Pierrette Simonet (Am\u00e9lie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
