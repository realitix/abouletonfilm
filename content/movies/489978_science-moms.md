Through interviews with \"science moms\" who are on the front lines of this struggle, we\u2019ll dissect the bogus claims of these celebrities one by one and explain in simple language what the science really shows about GMOs, vaccines, homeopathy, and any of these topics that are often in the headlines, yet even more often are misunderstood.  We can\u2019t change everyone\u2019s minds, but we can make our voices heard. One mom at a time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qq07HBMCgGM7VRKV0oXKFhtoPPh.jpg", "actors": ["Alison Bernstein (Self)", "Jenny Splitter (Self)", "Kavin Senapathy (Self)", "Layla Katiraee (Self)", "Anastasia Bodnar (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "lDfmZzY2leA"}
