There isn't much info out there-- especially not in English-- regarding the series in general (though there is an imdb link for the series as a whole) or the episode devoted to Epstein. Running around 25 minutes, the episode combines lengthy excerpts from Epstein's cinematic canon with the ideas contained in his theoretical texts to uncover the personal and conceptual underpinnings running beneath the work of this most exquisite filmmaker. I treasure this documentary in particular as it contains extensive footage from  L'Auberge rouge.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
