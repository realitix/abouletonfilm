With HD recording this new live album is truly a rewarding experience for all ASIA fans. After the recent DVD releases, this is Asia performing one of the very last shows featuring the original line up with: Geoff Downes, Steve Howe, Carl Palmer and John Wetton live on the road, in-your face and for your viewing pleasure. The reunion came to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the band, but morphed itself into an ongoing endeavour.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oYZL3hYuS3KCfnkfD0I8ScR9UfE.jpg", "actors": ["Geoff Downes (Keyboards)", "Carl Palmer (Drums)", "John Wetton (bass, vocals)", "Steve Howe (Guitars)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
