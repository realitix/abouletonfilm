Alfred Lowell is a washed-up actor sent to London to take care of some mob business. Alfred's mind is not on his job, as he prefers to probe his past for the reasons why he has failed as a thespian. He entertains thoughts of suicide, but his involvement in the gang prevents him from ending his life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qFBuurqR1SSEvcGgtmvcP6LmPTR.jpg", "actors": ["Ben Carruthers (Alfred Lowell)", "Fran\u00e7oise Brion (H\u00e9l\u00e8ne)", "Liesbeth List (Sandra van Dijk)", "Al Mancini (David Knight)", "Vladek Sheybal (Mijnheer Smith)", "Edina Ronay (Vriendin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
