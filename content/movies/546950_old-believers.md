The film briefly touches on a wealth of traditional arts (embroidery, clothing construction, weaving, vernacular architecture, folk song and foodways) and beautifully presents a whole series of rituals -- the \"devichnik\" (engagement party), \"selling\" the bride and her braid, the wedding feast, the bargaining over the dowry, and the ceremony of bestowing gifts and advice on the newlyweds. In English and Russian with subtitles or voice-over translations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mWJyvO8L013X8kBNE4xg0F9IhAn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
