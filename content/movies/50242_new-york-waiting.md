With a vintage Polaroid camera in hand, he takes to the New York streets, stopping occasionally at tourist attractions and coffee shops. Along the way, he unexpectedly meets a distraught woman who left her boyfriend that very morning after discovering that he had been unfaithful. Like Sidney, she too is drifting around Manhattan, as she waits for a flight to take her back to San Francisco.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yFcbska5fubLrsiyVdY7dlFqxB3.jpg", "actors": ["Christopher Stewart (Sidney)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
