A quick look at a couple of \"nice old folks\" and that should be it. But it's just the beginning of the story (or rather stories). While the folks he meets are a bit long in the tooth, they have a lot to say. With Pumpkins and Old Lace, Juliette Loubi\u00e8res joins the classic tradition of puppet animation films, creating a sincere, whimsical fairy tale with a moral that reminds us that old age is sometimes a mask guarding the treasures of our souls.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/huPMhKYyOY0IzO1T9YNwIbBhyGT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
