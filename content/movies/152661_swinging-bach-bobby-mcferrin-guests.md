And although there was a light rain and the concert was entirely outdoors, the huge crowd, some of them with umbrellas, were clearly transported by the music and by the performers who represented a cross-section of the best of classical and jazz artists. The concert started about 10:30am at night and lasted until 1am. And rain or not, it didn't look like anyone left. The audience was considerably younger than one would see at a typical classical music or even a typical jazz concert. And it appeared that everyone was having a marvelous time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a6718ZejjGsQYNjpNRxgKlbhtSB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
