The story tries to describe and reveal a few generations-lasting conflicts between the haves (proprietors) and have-nots (peasants), which develop into right wings and left wings respectively. While revealing why and how the conflicts come about, the story depicts every corner of real life -- romantic, shamanic, and Confucian aspects of the contemporaries.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2mTyswgPeqxPkcPkyVXEBrIjKhb.jpg", "actors": ["Ahn Sung-ki (Kim Beom-woo)", "Kim Myung-gon (Yeom Sang-jin)", "Kim Kap-soo (Yeom Sang-gu)", "Oh Jung-hae (So-hwa)", "Shin Hyun-joon (Jung Ha-sup)", "Choi Dong-joon (Shim Jae-mo)", "Jung Kyung-soon (Jook-san)", "Bang Eun-jin (Oe-seo)", "Lee Ho-jae (Dr. Jun)", "Jeong Jin-wan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
