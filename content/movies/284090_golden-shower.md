Zhuzhu decides to give up dancing to study abroad while Lixin stays behind. Meanwhile, Zhuzhu's friend Haiying quickly moves in to offer him comfort and love. Soon afterward, Haiying tries to convince him to accompany her to San Francisco and begin working with her uncle there. As they are just about to board the plane, Lixin spies Zhuzhu in the crowd and refuses to board the plane. Because they've said their goodbyes to family and friends, Lixin and Haiying find themselves hiding in a rented farmhouse outside the city, pretending to be abroad. Lixin spends most of his time asleep, and this infuriates Haiying, who decides to leave. In the end Lixin encounters his beloved Zhuzhu.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
