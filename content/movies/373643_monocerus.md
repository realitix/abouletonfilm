Therefore, no one understands why she suddenly loses control of her horse at a show, and badly injures herself. Sarah herself knows why she fell. In the middle of her jump she had a vision of her long lost grandmother Gudrun Schillingmeyer saying good bye. At the same time an old lady is put to rest in Norway. Gudrun lived a long and colored life. Now she follows her daughter Svanhild to her final resting place. What is the connection with Sarah's fear of horses?
