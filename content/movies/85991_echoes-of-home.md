The answer is: THE VOICE. Against a background of powerful alpine vistas and modern city landscapes, \"heimatkl\u00e4nge\" enters the wondrous sonic world of three exceptional Swiss vocal artists. Their universe of sound extends far beyond what we would describe as singing. In their engagement with local and foreign traditions, the powerful mountain landscape becomes a stage as do the landscapes and sonic backdrops of modern life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4CvVapBe32Sn4r7w0bmVRaouDI0.jpg", "actors": ["Erika Stucky (Herself)", "Noldi Alder (Himself)", "Christian Zehnder (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
