Ably directed by Ren\u00e9 Mugica, the tale begins when a young soccer player is sold at auction and expects to end up on a major team. Instead, he discovers he has been acquired by a super-rich tycoon whose objective in life is to collect the best -- not art or stamps -- but people. The wealthy collector does not allow his \"collection\" to do anything, which amounts to imprisoning everyone in a golden cage. While the ballerina he has on file expresses her longing for her art by surreptitiously dancing in the rain, the soccer player has a much more aggressive game plan for getting out of this predicament.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v9ZjAAva1lmfnOc4xyhf5qR2YFG.jpg", "actors": ["Luis Medina Castro (Cacho Garibaldi)", "Ra\u00fal Rossi (Lupus)", "Didi Carli (Nora Rodrigova)", "Enrique Fava (Hamlet)", "Francisco Pablo Donad\u00edo ()", "Pierina Dealessi (T\u00eda Dominga)", "Camilo Da Passano ()", "Arturo Arcari ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
