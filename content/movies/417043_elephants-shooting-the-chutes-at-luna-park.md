Y. A huge elephant stands at the top of the chutes and prepares for his trip. At his back is another elephant who starts his companion. The huge animal assumes a sitting position as he leaves the top and like a flash slides down the steep incline into the water. He strikes the water with a tremendous splash, remains under the water for a short time, enjoying his cool bath. It takes considerable coaxing on the part of his Arabian keeper to get him to come out of the water.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
