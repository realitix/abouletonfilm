One such town was Untidy Gulch, under the control of \"Blackmarket Bromide.\" It's overrun with outlaws who keep shooting their sheriffs. It puts an advertisement in a big-city Eastern newspaper asking for a clean-up man: \"Wanted: Clean-living, clean-thinking, clean-acting man to clean up Untidy Gulch. Must be clean.\" Hector answers the call... he thinks it's just a dirty town that needs sweeping. He grabs his broom and applies for the job. Bromide and his gang are ready for the Eastern gunfighter.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
