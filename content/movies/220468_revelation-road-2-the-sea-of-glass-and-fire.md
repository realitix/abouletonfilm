American live action feature length film, 2013, NR, 90 minutes, drama, action.\r\n2. IMDB: 4.4/10.0 from 330 audience ratings.\r\n3. Rotten Tomatoes: 'No reviews yet...' and 50% liked it from 112 audience ratings.\r\n4. Netflix: 3.5/5.0 from 88,047 audience ratings.\r\n5. Directed by: Gabriel Sabloff.\r\n6. Starring: David A. R. White as Josh McManus, Eric Roberts as Sheriff Jensen, Brian Bosworth as Hawg, Logan White as Cat, Roberta Bassin as Kathy Jensen, Noell Coet as Beth.\r\n\r\n**Setup and Plot**\r\n\r\n1. This film takes up just after the first movie ends.  There are a few scenes of the Sheriff's home life, and how the Rapture affected it.  Then we get back to the pursuit of Josh by Hawg.\r\n2. There are several flashbacks to explain Josh's fighting abilities.  There are several action sequences of fighting among Josh and allies versus Hawg and allies.  There are other flashbacks to what made Hawg so ornery, cantankerous, and murderous.\r\n3. The overall trend is to push Josh toward being religious and toward breaking his military training.  Hawg's gang is mostly wiped out.  Cat gets free of her father.\r\n4. Josh finds that his wife and daughter have been taken up in the Rapture.  He sets out to do something, which I expect might be explained in the third film.\r\n\r\n**Conclusions**\r\n\r\n1. One line summary: Continues in the Christian apocalypse mostly after the Rapture.\r\n2. Three stars of five.\r\n\r\n**Scores**\r\n\r\n1. Cinematography: 10/10 Fine camera work again.\r\n2. Sound: 8/10 No particular problems.\r\n3. Acting: 6/10  I liked David A. R. White, Brian Bosworth, Logan White, and even Eric Roberts in his short role.  Many of the secondary actors were not so good.\r\n4. Screenplay: 5/10 Long on flashbacks to explain the motivations of characters from the first film.  Again, short of story for a 90 minute movie."}], "recommandations_id": [90985, 37776, 204456, 179269]}
