His hobnobbing with the town-elite and social upper-crust at the polo-matches gives him an inflated idea of his social position, and he decides he is is moving on up. He breaks off with his girl-friend, true-blue Cynthia Brown, and hits on d\u00e9butante Gloria Staunton, who appears to have an interest in being hit upon. Gloria's interest lies mostly in showing Marco that hired-hands who can play polo still aren't to the manor born.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4KXg8JUUagw8MlXHyuCbUeGTZ0f.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Oakie (Marco Perkins)", "Mary Brian (Cynthia Brown)", "Richard 'Skeets' Gallagher (Chick Hathaway)", "Olive Borden (Gloria Staunton)", "Charles Sellon (Jim Perkins)", "Cyril Ring (Ralph Williams)", "E.H.
