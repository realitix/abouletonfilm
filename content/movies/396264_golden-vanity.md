In a solo tour-de-force, Melora Hardin (NBC's The Office & Amazon's Transparent) powerfully and painfully embodies the end product of the Hollywood use-them-up and spit-them-out machinery.  Drunk and alone in her empty mansion, Golden Vanity is Ms. Montgomery-Mayflower\u2019s last chance to preserve her horrifying and hilarious life story, one last shot to relive the glory days, before it\u2019s too late...", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nTe9zXL8gJdp4rBqKDoFxEDfZVd.jpg", "actors": ["Melora Hardin (Mabel Montgomery-Mayflower)", "Richard Riehle (Radio Announcer (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
