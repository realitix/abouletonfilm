It focuses on the construction of Daugavpils' synthetic fibre factory, and includes well-balanced, wide-angle shots and dramatic camera angles. The soundtrack is used imaginatively to create new meanings, and to construct metaphor like a musical artwork. The Construction also uses live interviews recorded on set; Arm\u012bns Leji\u0146\u0161, the trilogy's scriptwriter, appears on camera interviewing people.\" - VERZIO International Human Rights Documentary Film Festival", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3GqOjsaltKdeVM7A7H1naav8L1E.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
