It's a tale that only William Higgins would dare film, and the results, as usual, are X-rated and electrifying!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fkd88jBCNKPkCe1gBSVpIbO5pJI.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Madison ()", "Bobby Madison ()", "Joe Hardy ()", "Tim Hardy ()", "Lee Stern ()", "Carl Reeves ()", "Tim Richards ()", "Chris Taylor ()", "Scott Simpson ()", "David Grayson ()", "Cory Monroe ()", "Dusty Sands ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
