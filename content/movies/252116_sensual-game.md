The film begins in a lengthy free-love session taking the form of a 'play' rape being enacted by a group of aimless, listless and political apathetic students. The subtext intended by Adachi informs the rest of the film \u2013 that there is a world of difference between direct action politics, and merely talking the talk.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sjqocXfeICJY7inup7mWAV9XfRv.jpg", "actors": ["Kazuo Komizu ()", "Michio Akiyama ()", "Yukiko Manabe ()", "Hatsuo Yamaya ()", "Ken Yoshizawa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
