It's humorous, it's touching, and best of all . . . it's true!  Polly, age 76, is reminiscing on the unusual people and events of her time. As she reflects on her girlhood, the years begin to fall away one by one until . . . The early 1800's in Shelby, Michigan. Young Polly Merrill feels trapped by the daily demands of farm life, especially caring for her family's cow, Constance. She longs to do something lasting, something folks could remember. Polly shows that a very unremarkable person can have a remarkable story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i13WMMs4W4fCTUfrtb31JLfLRxX.jpg", "actors": ["Johanne Frechette Perry (Polly Matilda Merrill Colton)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
