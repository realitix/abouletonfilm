Thought lost until quite recently, this inscrutably-titled film is described as a 'pop fantasy' and offers an intriguing look at 60s sex and politics from a black British perspective.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5lvzogGMqEevFgT6ivxltfNSI27.jpg", "actors": ["Ken Gajadhar ()", "Donnah Dolce ()", "Merdelle Jordine ()", "Second Hand (Themselves - Musicians)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
