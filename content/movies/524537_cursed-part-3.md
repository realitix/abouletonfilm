The director immediately loses its star (Donna Mills) and has to step into the female lead role herself. Not an actor, a beauty, or even a very good director, she is forced to face her limits.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/duGdexQOYx41lpxuMJx4DJSwnTj.jpg", "actors": ["Chris Pratt (Devon)", "Amy Lyndon (Mavis)", "Annie Little (Xuxa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
