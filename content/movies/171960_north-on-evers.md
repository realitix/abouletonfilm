In many ways, this recent film is a departure of Benning\u2019s earlier films which are characterized, at times, by extremely long, carefully planned takes and a minimal narrative approach. In NORTH ON EVERS, the shots are kept short with a narrative that is direct and detailed, like a diary or a long series of postcards to a friend. What this work shares with the other films is a dry wit and a deep interest in the American social landscape.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/emVoarNd9kaNB2HDnwQvZaeNtmt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
