From 5000 to 2000 BC, the Sumerians flourished in a hostile environment by developing agriculture and irrigation and they opened up the trade routes of the ancient world. It was the Sumerians who invented writing and the wheel, and they first divided time into minutes and seconds. In the end however the Babylonian civilisation took the place of the Sumerians. However their heritage and myths live on in the Mediterranean and Western worlds to this day.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5mvqIX3HWhQIYvcc9XMRrgVIb02.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
