Twelve years after 'Los viajes escolares' (1973), his first commercial feature film, the Madrid director Jaime Ch\u00e1varri returns to the same estate in the province of Segovia to shoot a new family story, about his own plot and script. Like its predecessor, 'The Golden River' contains a strong autobiographical charge and is full of personal resonances. But this new history of family ties is narrated from a perspective in which adultery manifests itself openly. Endowed with a slow narrative rhythm, the film presents an international cast headed by \u00c1ngela Molina, Bruno Ganz, Francesca Annis and Stefan Gubser. The film also has the presence of a very young Juan Diego Botto, in one of his first appearances on the big screen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cmsguzQYoCT30Fz4xQpfSo2gNdO.jpg", "actors": ["\u00c1ngela Molina (Laura)", "Bruno Ganz (Peter)", "Francesca Annis (Dubarry)", "Stefan Gubser ()", "Juan Diego Botto (Miguel)", "Nacho Rodr\u00edguez (Jorge)", "Carolyn Norris (Juana)", "Nur Al Levi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
