Hans Hummel (Johannes Herrschmann) abandons a South Sea paradise and returns to his old homeland to trace his deceased father's path in life. His father has not only bequeathed him a large house and valuable documents, but also a type of treasure map in the form of a computer with the corresponding program. While he is involved in this treasure hunt game, he meets up with seven women - the family in the neighbouring house, who support him both in a business as well as in a personal sense. But instead of delighting in his new found wealth, he trades money, gold and millions for happiness - just like in a fairy tale.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3A6HIPAWZW6cMFIjp2BhK9VIv2q.jpg", "actors": ["Adriana Altaras (Alti)", "Johannes Herrschmann (Hans Hummel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
