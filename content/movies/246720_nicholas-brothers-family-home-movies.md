Highlights include the only footage shot inside the Cotton Club, the only footage of famous Broadway shows like \"Babes in Arms,\" home movies of an all African-American regiment during World War II, films of street life in Harlem in the 1930s, and the family's cross-country tour in 1934.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wJQXQmj3dhaZe2e3Mq10zJhawHu.jpg", "actors": ["Fayard Nicholas ()", "Harold Nicholas ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
