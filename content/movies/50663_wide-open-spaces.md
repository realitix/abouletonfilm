Myles (Ardal O'Hanlon) has one - Austin (Ewen Bremner) - only he's too much of a slacker to do anything about it.

Up to their necks in debt, they decide to help a dodgy entrepreneur, Gerard (Owen Roe), to create a new landmark in Irish tourism: a Famine Theme Park.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/umLmhyvVPTfUUNWUXXkcjtOqG1u.jpg", "actors": ["Ewen Bremner (Austin)", "Ardal O'Hanlon (Myles)", "Owen Roe (Gerard Ring)", "Don Wycherley (Dulally)", "Morwenna Banks (Leonie)", "Kelly Campbell (Joanna Smith)", "Gerard McSorley (Hingerty)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
