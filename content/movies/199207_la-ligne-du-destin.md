Though the girl believes the boy healed her, in reality the boy has no such powers. The father of the boy fools the village folk into believing he's a healer, but ultimately the sham is exposed, causing the village to revolt against the boy and his family.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i0aTBWa5tgFHiIbQSD8PxfXtSmf.jpg", "actors": ["Somapala Dharmapriya (Sena)", "Myrtle Fernando (Anula)", "Shesha Palihakkara (Miguel)", "Romulus de Silva (Village Headman)", "N.R.
