Machinery assists the bulb manufacture. A virtuoso glassblower begins a more complex tube used in radio broadcasting; it is then turned, fired, and sculpted. Conveyors carry partially completed units. Workers perform their various specific assembly-line tasks. Cases are manufactured and machined, wire harnesses are assembled, loudspeakers are produced. As radios near completion, they are run through a series of tests. Engineers and draughtsmen define future developments. In a closing stop-motion sequence, in a style reminiscent of Norman McLaren, a group of loudspeakers performs a playful dance. The film overall is a poetic depiction of an industrial process.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4mNVqZeOWV0VcRlqCxXQlows3fL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [148068, 315647, 183469, 128014], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
