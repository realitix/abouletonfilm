At Barcelona\u2019s Gran Teatre del Liceu David Alden\u2019s visually sumptuous production, with its suggestions of a giant game of chess, puts the opera\u2019s potent blend of sex and politics in a context that sets ancient against modern\u2013 just as the action juxtaposes scurrilous comedy and stark drama. Monteverdi\u2019s magnificent score, meanwhile, accommodates intrigue, wit, nobility, tragedy and sensuality, and, led by the intense Sarah Connolly and the delectable Miah Persson, the cast brings both drama and music startlingly to life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sYgvFhhqgPWdZA8ay92tpd1jNBH.jpg", "actors": ["Sarah Connolly (Nerone)", "Miah Persson (Poppea)", "Franz-Josef Selig (Seneca)", "Guy De Mey (Lucano)", "Jordi Dom\u00e8nech (Ottone)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
