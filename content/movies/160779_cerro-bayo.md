Her other daughter Mercedes comes from Buenos Aires but is less interested in her mother's condition than in possibly getting some of her money. Marta's husband has a great offer for a piece of land owned by his mother-in-law, but can't do anything while she is in a coma. Marta's son wants to travel to Europe but has no money for the airfare, and his sister wants to finally have an orgasm so that she can become less tense and increase her chances of winning a local beauty contest which she hopes will be a springboard for a modeling career in Buenos Aires.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rHtg9tCfj7S5YqGbYQRTti9PXHD.jpg", "actors": ["Adriana Barraza (Marta)", "In\u00e9s Efron (In\u00e9s)", "Ver\u00f3nica Llin\u00e1s (Mercedes)", "Nahuel P\u00e9rez Biscayart (Lucas)", "Guillermo Arengo (Eduardo)", "Marcela Kloosterboer (Romina)", "Adela Gleijer (Juana)", "Eugenia Alonso (Eugenia)", "Juan Barberini (Gendarme)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
