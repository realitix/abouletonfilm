As such he has a lot of representative duties, but also many privileges which made him snobby and condescending towards other dogs. But one day when the young Nataniel takes him for a walk, he's mixed up with the stray dog Moocher who looks like his identical twin. Henceforth Moocher takes Liberty's place in the White House. From now on a different spirit reigns in the White House", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pesAk7LCEix3BHydrUQe2zc7SBm.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Karn (Agent Dainville)", "Fred Willard (President)", "Vincent Schiavelli (Willy Wishbow)", "Cody Jones (Nate)", "Carolyn Dunn (Mary)", "Laura Press (Margaret Caldwell)", "Peter MacNicol (Liberty (voice))", "Daryl Mitchell (Moocher (voice))", "George Wendt (Sheldon Sparks)", "Brian Hunter (Agent)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [369450, 123615, 39268, 113211], "youtube_key": "vOBHeqFMr1U"}
