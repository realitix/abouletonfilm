Richard Serra\u2019s film, Hand Catching Lead, illustrates the mechanism. Echoing the vertical movement of the film through the projector, pieces of sheet lead fall into the image field. Serra\u2019s hand opens and closes as it tries to catch them, and when it succeeds, immediately lets them go again, reproducing the intermittent advance of the film. But that is not all, for as the action progresses, Serra\u2019s hand, blackened by the lead, shadow-like comes to resemble the silhouette of a dog trying to catch something thrown to it, thus referring the mechanics of cinema back to its origins in the art of shadow theatre.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/umEzDzWCmHKNPj9tOHWxfoANmpC.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Serra (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
