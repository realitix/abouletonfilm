With the 16mm Bolex camera mounted on a tripod, I wound the motor a single crank and ran as far as I could before the camera stopped (about 1 second). I returned and wound it 2 cranks and did the same, then repeated the process adding one crank each time. With these self-imposed limitations, would I make it to the top of the hill before the film ran out?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bjnXFYOBMiujsZwA9PdpW97nkUG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
