In 1993, a team of doctors in Paris discovered that these patients had developed a new disease called Macrophagic Myofascitis, or MMF, which occurs when the aluminum hydroxide adjuvant from a vaccine remains embedded in the muscle tissue and causes an immune reaction. Featuring interviews with patients, doctors, scientists, and influential politicians, Injecting Aluminum calls in to question the public health policies around aluminum in vaccines and examines aluminum's devastating effects on the human body.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3YnXa43hAxGPp0WgG17e2D5UQCP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
