There, where love becomes almost inhuman and divine. As if he was a comet, Rafael, the traveler, appears at the party for the cities patron saint, in a small town in the interior of Minas Gerais. He is the one who brings passion and crime, vanishing afterwards, leaving a poetic feeling in the air, which is always deadly to the ones who stay. Mrs. Ana de Lara, the proud rich widow, and Missy, still a child, whose beauty and innocence are like the Ti\u00ea-Sangue, a red bird, are the travelers victims. There is also Master Juca do Vale, a criminal, whose passion turns him incredibly human, in this story of love, death, forgiveness and resurrection.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cS06nTrpbkbIiNKQqeAyJ9EWZNk.jpg", "actors": ["Leandra Leal ()", "Mar\u00edlia P\u00eara ()", "Nelson Dantas ()", "Jairo Mattos ()", "Ricardo Gra\u00e7a Mello ()", "Paulo C\u00e9sar Per\u00e9io ()", "Ana Maria Nascimento e Silva ()", "Irma \u00c1lvarez ()", "Roberto Bonfim ()", "Hileana Menezes ()", "Milton Nascimento ()", "Leina Krespi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
