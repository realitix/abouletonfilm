Everybody likes him--except for the two people he loves most, his father (Malladi Raghava) and Ankita (Genelia D'Souza), the girl with whom he is in love with. Because he and his father don't get along, Sathyam leaves home and starts living with friends. A sensitive man and sensible writer, Satyam ghost-writes for a popular film lyricist. He wants to prove himself as lyricist before meeting Ankita, when he intends to express his love for her; except in the meanwhile, a flamboyant classmate of Ankita proposes to her. The movie then witnesses a turn of events which involves Ankita`s father (Kota Srinivas Rao) who happens to be a good friend of Satyam. In the end, its all a happy ending when Ankita realizes the love Satyam has for her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dg9P4ogtaesuhXyv8S5b2XktoI4.jpg", "actors": ["Sumanth ()", "Genelia D'Souza ()", "Kota Srinivasa Rao ()", "Brahmanandam ()", "Tanikella Bharani ()", "Kondavalasa Lakshmana Rao ()", "Satyam Rajesh ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
