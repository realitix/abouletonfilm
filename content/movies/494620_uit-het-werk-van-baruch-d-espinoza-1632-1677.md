Each component was filmed four times at least, in a different setting with different actors. Spinoza's sentences are taken as dialogues 'tout court', and not as a collection of opinions. Spinoza's style of philosophical thinking is presented as an activity in the first place, which is then revealed by each individual actor in his own way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hNYoTJVXuaVHOqm7scfuk1e1ZMH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
