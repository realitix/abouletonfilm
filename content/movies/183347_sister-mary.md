As the details of the case slowly emerge the police determine that that the \"nun\" may only be a silent witness to the grisly murders. The task force then turns its attention on the Catholic Church and a suspect group of Priests that have had a propensity for \"cleansing the souls\" of innocent young choir boys.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1MZICHt0nJ5s8N4Epmfvtizqcg.jpg", "actors": ["Ant (Agent Peccant)", "James Vallo (Mark Rima)", "Bruce Vilanch (Farmer Jake)", "Matthew Feeney (Chief Homer Bathos)", "Michelle Shields (Detective Emma Sharp)", "James Pusztay (Father O'Bleary)", "Z.D.
