While Rodrigo may have attempted to put his past life behind him, the memory of his now deceased mother and his old-world family returns to haunt him. In an old city dominated by the weight of tradition, Rodrigo discovers a daughter about whose existence he had never known, as well as a grand-daughter, the enigmatic and beautiful Octavia. A rebellious teenager, Octavia dismisses her grandfather's old politics, possessing her own sense of what freedom means. Patino's film is a poetic, assured contemplation on the pain of returning somewhere you never really left and the accompanying ironies of a man obsessed with history who cannot face his own.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nj61RIVwGdPOgkN0ZVXLq3vkCVk.jpg", "actors": ["Miguel \u00c1ngel Sol\u00e1 (Rodrigo)", "Margarita Lozano (Do\u00f1a)", "Antonia San Juan (Manuela)", "Blanca Oteyza (Elsa)", "Paul Naschy (Inspector)", "Javier Rioyo (Journalist)", "Menh-Wai Trinh (Octavia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
