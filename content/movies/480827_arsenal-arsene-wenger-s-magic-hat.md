'Arsene Wenger's Magic Hat' features highlights from the 2001/02 season, such as Tony Adams' Testimonial and Lee Dixon's final game for the club as well as including interviews with players and the manager himself. Whilst 'Boring Boring Arsenal' shows how the team managed to claw their way to the title after being completely out of the 1997/98 championship race before Christmas. In winning the double in style, the 'Gunners' finally lost their 'Boring, Boring Arsenal' tag, thanks to Dennis Bergkamp, Patrick Viera, Emmanuel Petit, Nicholas Anelka and Marc Overmars. All the highlights are included here, alongside interviews with Petit, Vieira and Wenger.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n2uCRHqZfxjIsMNmfmzeURUEP4T.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
