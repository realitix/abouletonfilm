Calhoun into mouse population growth. An almost entertaining look at overpopulation, it cross references with many other thoughtful theories to give, if not a bleak, but insightful look upon humanities future. It regularly surprises you with it's good production value and critical examination of a vast empire built upon a finite resource. Population growth for humanity has gone unchecked for the last few hundred years with the industrial revolution, and has exponentially increased our numbers. This documentary is a must watch for anyone interested in a population boom never before seen on our planet."}], "recommandations_id": []}
