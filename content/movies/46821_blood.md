They don't seem to remember their mother, and are very much attached to their father, despite his temper, and his frequent absences from home. One day, the father leaves for good, and Vicente and Nino swear to cover it up. It's their secret. Clara, the primary school assistant, is fascinatingly beautiful, and secretive, and (may be) she knows it aswel. There are other secrets, though: the origin of the money that appears at Vicente's house; the relationship between Vicente's well-to-do uncle and his girlfriend; the relationship between the four people who once played the cards together, and now can't stand each other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eQkantIWXrGNln5gYhloBTG13om.jpg", "actors": ["Pedro Hestnes (Vicente)", "Nuno Ferreira (Nino)", "In\u00eas de Medeiros (Clara)", "Lu\u00eds Miguel Cintra (The Uncle)", "Canto e Castro (The Father)", "Isabel de Castro (The Woman)", "Henrique Viana (1st creditor)", "Lu\u00eds Santos (2nd creditor)", "Manuel Jo\u00e3o Vieira (Zeca)", "Sara Breia (Rosa)", "Jos\u00e9 Eduardo (Partner)", "Ana Otero (The Uncle's Lover)", "Pedro Miguel (Boy in the warehouse)", "Miguel Fernandes (Pedro)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [18950], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
