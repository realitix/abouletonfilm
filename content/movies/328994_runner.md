She dominated her sport, holding US records in every distance from 800 to 10,000 meters, and she did it all without the Olympics. She was too young in '72, hurt in '76 and shut out by the U.S. boycott in '80. As Sports Illustrated's cover Sportswoman of the Year in 1983, she was ready: 1984 was the target, with the Olympics in LA and her skills at their 25 year-old peak. But the story leads to a single shocking moment in the 1984 Olympics, with Mary writhing on the ground in physical pain and emotional heartbreak with the whole world watching.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dWLtqOm3lGLyoNuBwPV6P0SPZ2q.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
