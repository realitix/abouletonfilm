His influence spread to an entire generation of blues-tinged rockers, including The Rolling Stones and The Doors. Hooker's music is a lesson in deep blues, and here he revisits some of his most familiar material, including \"Boom Boom\" and his biggest hit, \"I'm in the Mood.\" Filled with frisky, guitar-driven boogies and heartsick ballads, this is the blues at its very best! Songs: It Serves Me Right to Suffer, One Bourbon One Scotch One Beer, I'll Never Get Out of These Blues Alive, Roll Me Like You Roll a Wagon Wheel, Boom Boom, I'm in the Mood, Look at What You Did to My Life, Chicken and Gravy, We're Gonna Do the Shout.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q1h2ggOVO8WBAhGk5buFgjhPRJS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
