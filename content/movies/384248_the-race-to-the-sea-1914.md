In an attempt to go back to mobile warfare both sides tried to outflank the other by manoeuvring around their western flank. The Race to the sea had begun. As a result of this movement the BEF moved from just North east of Paris to the Allies western flank in Flanders. This is the story of the BEF's desperate attempts to outflank the Germans and prevent themselves from being outflanked.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jBB8oDmkWs2djdwXDcDZXPGfhhG.jpg", "actors": ["Vern Littley (Presenter)", "Tim Saunders (Presenter)", "Andrew Duff (Presenter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
