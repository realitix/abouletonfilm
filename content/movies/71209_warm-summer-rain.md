Reflecting briefly upon her circumstance in the hospital, she realizes that nothing has been solved, whereupon she vacates the premises, wearing nothing but a hospital gown, a black coat, and flimsy sandals. Shortly thereafter, at a bus station, she requests from the attendant a bus ticket to wherever, with consideration to the limited funds she has to spare. The attendant insists on a destination, or even a direction - Kate spins about, points, and says, \"that way\". The story then evolves to include Barry Tubb, her love interest, who rekindles her will to live.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fA5pWecZ7HFa65NSNrqDJucL7hZ.jpg", "actors": ["Kelly Lynch (Kate)", "Barry Tubb (Guy)", "Ron Sloan ()", "Larry Poindexter ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
