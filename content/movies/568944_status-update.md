After transferring to a new school, he decides to write an article about the bullying of a gay student at his new school. In order to really shake things up, Josh decides to make his article a grand social experiment by changing his Facebook status to \"interested in men\" and writing about how perceptions of family, teammates and teachers change toward him. But Josh gets more than he bargained for when a fellow student with a crush on him, posts a tribute video about his hero \"Josh the Gay Quarterback\". The video goes viral and Josh suddenly finds himself shot into the media spotlight and a hero to gay teens across the country.
