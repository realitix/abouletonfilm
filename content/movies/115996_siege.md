This was just a routine warrant, something they had done countless times. What was meant to be an ordinary procedure turned into three of New Zealand\u2019s darkest days and ended with one police officer dead, two officers critically injured and a member of the public fighting for his life. In some fifty hours Jan Molenaar made a permanent and devastating imprint upon the national psyche of New Zealand as he changed the lives of individuals, families, a police community, and a city. The siege was one of the worst and unexpected cases of violence both Napier and New Zealand had witnessed and it was all the more shocking because of its ordinary suburban backdrop.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/boda1uJbDtu03OPv5hfjtm9S5CP.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Mitchinson (Jan Molenaar)", "Darren Young (Len Snee)", "Jon Cummings (Lenny Holmwood)", "Joel Tobeck (Sam Hoyle)", "Miriama Smith (Delwyn Keefe)", "Alistair Browning (Mike O'Leary)", "Toby Leach (Grant Diver)", "Will Hall (Bruce Miller)", "Kirk Torrance (Heath Jones)", "Mark Warren (Brad Clark)", "Peter Feeney (Paul Symonds)", "Nathalie Boltt (Vicki Snee)", "Laurie Dee (Kevin Kalff)", "Jason Whyte (Ryan Wood)", "Andrew Robertt (Mike Burne)", "Phil Brown (Dennis Hurworth)", "William Wallace (Paul Buckley)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
