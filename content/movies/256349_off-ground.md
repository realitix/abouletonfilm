A slender woman of 50 and a 12 year old boy. Joined together like the links of a chain. Changing positions at a constant rate. One flowing movement. Never losing touch with each other. A game played by a mother and her child. A kind of tango. Sound of feet. Breathing. Faint smiles. Until suddenly the woman's hands let go of each other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4SPAZQJsXrxID5T3C0UbvbC5ClU.jpg", "actors": ["Antoine Mason (Boy)", "Louise Lecavalier (Mother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
