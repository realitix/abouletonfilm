Surprisingly, many patients and families embraced the concept. The resulting film is a profound and moving chronicle of five hospice patients whose stories are honest, humorous, and heartbreaking. Examining such profound issues as the meaning of suffering, the desire for love and forgiveness, and the horror of death, the film is an intensely personal meditation on the experience of death, both for the dying and for those who must go on living.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uMyLFAwbzdUmEVq06yPGDysulG4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
