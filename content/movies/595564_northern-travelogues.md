The journey produced a unique documentary film and a travelogue. A hundred years later director Kira J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen returns to the Bering Strait in P\u00e4lsi's footsteps. Combining old and new film footage, P\u00e4lsi's notes and the stories of the local indigenous peoples, the film highlights the story of the Chukchi and Siberian Eskimos from bygone days till today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bN7zPPT6HIEi916jx0SLR5OKIhD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
