Jamie fishes, plucks ducks, and traps rabbits. He helps his mother churn butter, collect eggs and bake bread. Children can compare the food Jamie eats with the food they eat - some of it the same, like buckwheat pancakes and blueberry muffins, and some of it different, like rabbit stew and duck pie.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1M92xs9glvOhMOj5ctjzivDaTaY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
