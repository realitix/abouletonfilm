She attempts to assuage her idealistic bent by trying out life as a nun, but this doesn't work out. After she leaves the convent, she takes a job at a factory, where the callousness of management spurs her to become a labor activist. Her efforts are marked by great persistence and fervor, but she lacks any kind of diplomacy or persuasiveness, and as the years progress, she manages to alienate everyone in her life. By the end of the film, there is only one way that she can see to resolve the horrible situation she finds herself in.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/motIg5ayx42njNiI8GvwzZkIYYA.jpg", "actors": ["Solveig Dommartin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
