It's a solid Bond flick, but rarely cited when the best films of the franchise are discussed. The \"problem\" isn't Dalton because he makes a fine James Bond and was what the series needed in 1987 (when the film was released). Although the Roger Moore era (1973-1985) is my favorite stretch of the franchise, mainly because they're so all-around entertaining, Roger was just too old in 1987 to continue in the role (he was 60 years-old). Plus I think everyone was craving a more serious Bond by 1987 and Dalton delivers the goods.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a lot of good in \"The Living Daylights.\" It features a great opening sequence involving skydiving at the Rock of Gibraltar followed by a Jeep-going-down-the-mountain segment. The events switch to Bratislava, Slovakia (but shot in Vienna, Austria) where everything slows down to dramatic intrigue. A short while later there's a cool winter chase episode with Bond and his romantic interest (Maryam d'Abo) in a car with skis (also shot in Austria).\r\n\r\nThe action-packed last act takes place in Afghanistan (but shot in Morocco and the Mojave Desert). This part of the movie increases in suspense as James and his babe try to get out of the country on a cargo plane, and the film still doesn't end at that point. This climax features three or four excellent suspense scenes and some funny quips as well.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the film is weak in the area of women. D'Abo is decent in a doe-eyed, winsome way, but her presence is never really capitalized on; she looks good in slacks though. Other than her, there are only brief flashes of women with no one particularly standing out, except maybe a blonde in white shorts.\r\n\r\nThe cast also includes Joe Don Baker, Jeroen Krabb\u00e9, John Rhys-Davies and Andreas Wisniewski, mostly villains or possible villains.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE: Although \"The Living Daylights\" is not a highlight of the series, it's still a worthwhile Bond flick with the usual staples, albeit shaky in the female department. Aside from Timothy Dalton, who makes a refreshing Bond, the opening and ending sequences are the best parts.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"}], "recommandations_id": [709, 707, 699, 700]}
