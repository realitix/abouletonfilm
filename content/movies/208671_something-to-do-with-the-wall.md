They thought they were making a documentary on the community of tourists, soldiers, and West Berliners who lived in the seemingly eternal presence of the graffiti emblazoned eyesore.  But in 1989, as the original film neared completion, the Wall came down, and McElwee and Levine returned to Berlin, this time to capture the radically different atmosphere of the reunified city.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pOmocPeD2aMT8TjVL2YxJ7M2Sl3.jpg", "actors": ["Ross McElwee (Narrator)", "Marilyn Levine (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
