She had turned to bomb making in grief after her mentor and lover, An Rong, who was also her university professor, was arrested for political activity and, she presumed, executed. In prison, she learns Rong is alive, and she maintains her spirits and sanity for the years in her cell by holding imaginary conversations with him. When she is released, she discovers he is married, has a child, and lives conventionally. She finds him; he's not happy to see her. How she reacts to losing the center of her life becomes the subject of the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/scGClmzFIUQgbxuYA0fJZeZnYqH.jpg", "actors": ["Vicky Wei (Chen Lin-Lang)", "Jieh-Wen King (Wang Rong)", "Ching-Ju Chang (An-An Wang's Wife)", "Tsai Chen-Nan (Jin Guang)", "Wen Ying (Wang's Mother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
