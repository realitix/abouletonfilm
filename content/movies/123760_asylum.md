A strange mix of both documentary and fiction, where in the future a group of people are looking back at the twentieth century. A virus has wiped out most of the culture of the twentieth century, leaving just fragments of a project called 'The Perimeter Fence' to be pieced together. These fragments make up a documentary about an exiled group of disparate yet similar minds.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Michael Moorcock ()", "Ed Dorn ()", "James Sallis ()", "Marina Warner ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
