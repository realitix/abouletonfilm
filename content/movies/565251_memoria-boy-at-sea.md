Given his affinity for the Amazon, of which Thai jungle tales were originally inspired, Weerasethakul has started to explore South America - and since 2017, has been developing a film based in Colombia. He is drawn to its topography, where active volcanoes and landslides ceaselessly transform natural landscapes.  The Memoria Project presents both personal and collective memories, while retaining the artist\u2019s fascination with illumination. A vital part of the video and photographic works is the presence of a lone protagonist on the beach. Weerasethakul worked with Canadian actor Connor Jessup who visited him during the filming of a documentary at Nuqu\u00ed area in Choc\u00f3 Department, western Colombia. Here, the actor is a spirit that contemplates the artist\u2019s journey, his dream of both real and imaginary films.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o6e1A6DeJS2Y1x1WVYtMyxJxenj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
