He takes a cab driven by Dixie Dugan, who hopes that being a cabbie while the country's men are away fighting will help the war effort. Her incompetent driving, however, results in an accident for which Roger must take responsibility in order to reach the radio station in time. Dixie then returns home, where she lives with her father Timothy, who is constantly practicing his air raid warden duties, her mother Gladys, an aspiring Red Cross worker, and cousin Imogene, who studies incessantly to become a \"quiz kid.\" The Dugans rent out their spare rooms to Dixie's fianc\u00e9, Matt Hogan, and to blustering Judge J. J. Lawson. Matt, who works in a munitions factory, wants Dixie to settle down and marry him, but Dixie is determined to help her country.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jxc7WD57axaNDr56CJhBhF8GwCx.jpg", "actors": ["Lois Andrews (Dixie Dugan)", "James Ellison (Roger Hudson)", "Charlotte Greenwood (Mrs. Dugan)", "Charles Ruggles (Pa Dugan)", "Helene Reynolds (Jean Patterson)", "Raymond Walburn (J.J.
