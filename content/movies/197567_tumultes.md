Patrick dies and his three sisters gather at their parents' home in Normandy. Anne, the oldest, is steady, married with two children, showing little emotion. Isabelle, who's cut herself off from her family for eight years, returns from Paris. Claude, Patrick's twin and still a student, grieves for her other half. Along with their parents, each must face family grievances first before they can grieve together for Patrick. Then comes the revelation of how he died, and new feelings come to the fore. Can a death help a family to heal, coax an aging mother back to sanity, bring a couple into each other's arms, and enable two sisters to grow?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eiGyxhqDaPOiWGP5WuFxsS89fjZ.jpg", "actors": ["Bruno Cremer ()", "Nelly Borgeaud ()", "Julie J\u00e9z\u00e9quel ()", "Clotilde de Bayser ()", "Laure Marsac ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
