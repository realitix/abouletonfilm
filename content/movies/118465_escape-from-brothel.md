Pauline's boyfriend, Sam, back in China, who is under the impression that she is away working at a factory, is double-crossed by Billy Chow, and while looking to escape; flees for Hong Kong and winds up at the Brothel where Pauline is employed. He is crushed when he finds out the truth, but by this point, everyone involved on all sides is too deeply involved to turn back. This is the type of movie that could only come from HK. It combines plenty of gory fighting, romance, violent A great scenes and comedy, all into one. A grand finale, where those who haven't already been killed fight it out on a construction site. In summary; heaps of sex and violence-has a few great bits, but not recommended for the weak-hearted.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/he5jomIvBjZpGeZe1CczGovq9TS.jpg", "actors": ["Pauline Chan Bo-Lin (Hung)", "Rena Murakami (Ann)", "Alex Fong Chung-Sun (Sam Ma)", "Billy Chow (Billy Ho)", "Jamie Luk Kim-Ming (Hanky)", "Stuart Ong (Mr Chou)", "William Ho Ka-Kui (Inspector Chan)", "Billy Ching Sau-Yat (Cross Dresser)", "Pak Yan (Suzie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
