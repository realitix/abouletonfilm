His father is a rich and sensible man who gives sane counsel to the people around. Siddharthan is a devotee but his brother Mani is an atheist and stays put and steadfast in his beliefs. One day, Siddharthan suddenly loses interest in everything worldly and embarks on a journey to the Himalayas as a seeker of truth. But he returns 11 years later as a hard core atheist who has lost all his faith in spirituality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/13i3vcGIIjLdUmok6EdGt7BPUKG.jpg", "actors": ["Vinay Forrt (Siddharthan)", "Jijoy Rajagopal (Mani, Siddharathan's brother)", "Madhu (Siddharathan's father)", "Swasika (Siddharathan's fiance)", "Kalabhavan Mani (police officer)", "Prakash Bare (god-man)", "Salim Kumar ()", "Tovino Thomas (Che Guevara Sudheendran)", "Ambika Mohan ()", "Kulappulli Leela ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "C63fJgT4QKA"}
