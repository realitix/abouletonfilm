Sam is enticed from his home by hearing the sound of mouth harps played by two of his friends; out of the window he comes. He then gets a job to carry a trunk, an organ-grinder starts his feet a-going; he gets a job as waiter, the orchestra does the balance. Then he becomes a porter, the Dutch band finishes him with this position; then a barber, an artist's model and other positions, from all of which he is promptly fired because he can't keep his feet still when the strains of music float in the air.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
