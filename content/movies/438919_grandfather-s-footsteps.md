Later some more boxes of his negatives turned up at a country house sale. I printed them and made enlargements from some of them, and a few years later the idea came to me to use them in a film.  'In Grandfather's Footsteps the film-maker re-evokes the presence of her great-grandfather, Henry Stiles Savory, a Victorian clergyman, photographer and scientist. It's not a costume drama, bringing in his writings, and his personal effects - books, machines, photographs - Anne Rees-Mogg emphasizes her own links with him and his preoccupations. She achieves a real sense of timelessness.' - Jo Comino", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i2qnM5tje5V3lkJlnMpT7LuqCyB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
