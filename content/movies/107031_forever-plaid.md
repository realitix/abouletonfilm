This quartet of high-school chums, and their earnest dreams of recording an album, ended (symbolically, and even literally) in death, when their cherry red '54 Mercury collided with a bus filled with Catholic schoolgirls on their way to see the Beatles' American debut on The Ed Sullivan Show. The girls were fine. The play begins with the wondrous and wondering Plaids returning from the afterlife for one final chance at musical glory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2g2pWpINc6qz2mrqFin7Rwsiw1x.jpg", "actors": ["Stan Chandler (Jinx)", "David Engel (Smudge)", "Larry Raben (Sparky)", "Daniel Reichard (Francis)", "David Hyde Pierce (The Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
