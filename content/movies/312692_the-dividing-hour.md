But when the car stalls and they catch a ride with a stranger, they end up in a farmhouse where nothing is as it seems. Soon, they discover they have enemies to face who are far more menacing than the cops tailing them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qmFNuUIGWS1r3E5L3Bq3PdJDQSI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
