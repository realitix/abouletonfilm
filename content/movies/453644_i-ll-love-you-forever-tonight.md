Ethan (Paul Marius), a 27-year-old photographer, believes he has no need for love or commitments, and is living his life amidst one-night stands. Ethan is coaxed by his \"best buddy\" Dennis (Jason Adams) into attending a reunion of college friends and lovers at a Palm Springs hideaway. What is supposed to be a restful vacation turns into a round of hard drinking and cruel sexual games. By the end of the \"vacation,\" Ethan feels a need for new friends and returns to Los Angeles. Confronting his troubled family life, he calls his father - who doesn't want anything to do with him. In the end, Ethan realizes that he can make his own \"family\" with friends who will accept each other without judgments.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ljLRWXS7Jp7QrSNxxGICrH7F1OK.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Marius (Ethan)", "Ash Adams (Dennis)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
