Each woman is given 3\u00bd minutes in front of the camera - the length of a roll of super-8. A chorus of red and white Kodak leader separates the individual rolls. By juxtaposing various examples of female self-definition against the backdrop of a decaying social order, the film is also the rehearsal and paradigm for Dick's subsequent work.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j3YccZuJEJXwpMxdnJbcVwoExss.jpg", "actors": ["Anya Phillips ()", "Lydia Lunch ()", "Ikue Mori ()", "Vivienne Dick ()", "Beate Nilsen ()", "Adele Bertei ()", "Pat Place ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
