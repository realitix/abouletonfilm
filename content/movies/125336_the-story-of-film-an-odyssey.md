Five years in the making, The Story of Film: An Odyssey covers six continents and 12 decades, showing how film-makers are influenced both by the historical events of their times, and by each other. It provides a worldwide guided tour of the greatest movies ever made; an epic tale that starts in nickelodeons and ends as a multi-billion-dollar globalised digital industry.  Described as a love letter to the movies, Cousins visits the key sites in the history of cinema; from Hollywood to Mumbai; from Hitchcock s London to the village where Pather Panchali was shot, and features interviews with legendary filmmakers and actors including Stanley Donen, Kyoko Kagawa, Gus van Sant, Lars Von Trier, Claire Denis, Bernardo Bertolucci, Robert Towne, Jane Campion and Claudia Cardinale.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/21JcMfxZr0V7sDHQtaTbygL9FzQ.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Cousins (Narrator)", "Jean-Michel Frodon (Himself - Interviewee)", "Cari Beauchamp (Herself - Interviewee)", "Agnes de Mille (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [46798, 120329, 106254, 42018], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
