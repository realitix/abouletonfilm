Composer Georg Kaiser is unable to secure a divorce from his wife, so he \"lives in sin\" with his singer-sweetheart Causa. The girl's wealthy uncle dies, leaving her millions -- provided she is married to Georg Kaiser. Hoping to take advantage of a legal loophole, Georg seeks out another man named George Kaiser, intending to marry him off to Causa so that she can collect her legacy. Georg Kaiser # 2 is a middle-aged naif who can't understand why his new bride is so cold to him. When he finds out he's been duped by Kaiser #1, Kaiser #2 finds solace in the arms of another woman closer to his own age, which somehow leads to a happy ending for all concerned.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Charlotte Susa (Irene Kaiser)", "Georg Alexander (Dr. Wender, Rechtsanwalt)", "Paul Morgan (Sr. Springer, Rechtsanwalt)", "Hans Moser (Georg Kaiser II., B\u00fcrovorsteher)", "Rosa Valetti ()", "Werner Fuetterer (Georg Kaiser I.)", "Trude Brionne (H\u00fchnerbein)", "Tamara Desni ()", "Anita Mey ()", "Walter Steinbeck (Richter)", "Edwin J\u00fcrgensen (Kabarettdirektor)", "Gerhard Dammann (Gerichtsdiener)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
