They talk about their first sexual experiences, the gay scene in San Francisco in the late 1970s, the pall cast by AIDS, the safe-sex movement, getting into serious relationships, the illness and death of partners, pornography, S/M and pain, race and stereotypes, personal fantasies, and bliss. Huestis has a thesis, that sex is going to be with us, so how best do we embrace it? His 15 subjects, archival footage, clips from porn films, and close-up looks at men loving men flesh out various answers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4Y6S5d0pmfjtjEQKKgT8F9FDG2h.jpg", "actors": ["Larry Brinkin (Himself)", "Danny Castellow (Himself)", "Alex Chee (Himself)", "Wayne Corbitt (Himself)", "Jim Glyer (Himself)", "Miguel Guti\u00e9rrez (Himself)", "Robert Hawk (Himself)", "Marc Huestis (Himself)", "Gerard Koskovich (Himself)", "Bambi Lake (Himself)", "R.
