It\u2019s always exciting, filled with plenty of surprises, and with enough hard work, you\u2019re granted some really amazing moments. But most of all, they\u2019re a real pain in the ass. I should know, I\u2019ve made fifteen of \u2018em, in addition to commercials, music videos, major movies\u2014you name it. But snowboard movies are the worst. Anyone who has ever worked on a half-assed snowboard movie knows just how much work it is, from dealing with riders who won\u2019t get off the couch to crappy weather and snow conditions that plague film crews all year.
