His sponsor encourages him to talk that night, the first time in seven months, so he does - and leaves the meeting right after. As Jim wanders the night, searching for some solace in his old stomping grounds, bars and parks where he bought drugs, the meeting goes on, and we hear the stories of survivors and addicts - some, like Louis, who claim to have wandered in looking for choir practice, who don't call themselves alcoholic, and others, like Joseph, whose drinking almost caused the death of his child - as they talk about their lives at the meeting", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m4hhljww2oSBtEDPBqHRifSJXJd.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Lewis (Jim)", "Amanda Plummer (Shelley)", "Spalding Gray (Louis)", "Faye Dunaway (Becky)", "Parker Posey (Debbie)", "Howard Rollins (Joseph)", "Dianne Wiest (Rachel)", "Sam Rockwell (Tony)", "Kevin Corrigan (Cam)", "LisaGay Hamilton (Brenda)", "Calista Flockhart (Helen)", "George Martin (Marty)", "Zach Grenier (Al)", "Michael Medeiros (Charlie)", "Anna Levine (Tanya (as Anna Thomson))", "Liza Harris (Melanie)", "Fanni Green (Jasmine)", "Liam Ahern (Billy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Amf-MNqWxmc"}
