Born in Vietnam but raised in Canada, L\u00ea\u2019s homeland pilgrimage is measured parts self-portrait, ethnography and an ethereal quest for identity. His b\u00e0 n\u00f4i is funny and forthright in a matriarchal manner, as one with little time to worry about what others think. Stark observations of her home life and family visits contrast visually stunning dreamlike sequences of fog-laced silhouettes and twilight vistas that echo an unpredictable path. As he celebrates New Year\u2019s events with family traditions and rituals steeped in superstition, fortunes and horoscopes, it\u2019s clear L\u00ea is seeking signs of destiny as he poetically captures a soul floating between two worlds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5QPhpDZqMKSy4OtvDTYLgNDHJk8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "62752875"}
