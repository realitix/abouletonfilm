The man who turned eating into dining. The first great restaurant chef, Escoffier established restaurants in grand hotels all over the world and in these centres of luxury and decadence, the world's most glamorous figures of the day would mix: actresses and princes, duchesses and opera singers. Catering to this international jet set, Escoffier produced fabulous dishes that combined luxury and theatricality, elevating restaurant food to an art form. In a time of untold luxury and decadence, when money and pleasure combined like never before, he cooked and named dishes for all of London's society - from Queen Victoria and Bertie, the fun-loving Prince of Wales, to the most glamorous entertainers of the day - Oscar Wilde, the actress Sarah Bernhardt and opera singer Nellie Melba.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sWbA7NeISWce53EE00PZ6GvqaGq.jpg", "actors": ["Michel Roux Jr (Himself - Presenter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "DOG8PRVy4-U"}
