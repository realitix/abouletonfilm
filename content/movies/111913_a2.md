Most followers had no idea that the attacks were being planned, or even that their new religion had violent aspirations. After the attacks, these followers were left to rebuild the religion where they had once found peace in the face of overwhelming, and understandable, condemnation from the rest of Japan. Central focus is placed on Hiroshi Araki, a young man who finds himself elevated to chief spokesman for Aum after its leaders are arrested. Araki faces extreme hostility from the Japanese public, who find it hard to believe that most followers of the cult had no idea of the attacks and even harder to understand why these followers remain devoted to the religion, if not the violence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yZhsMgsrv4TgvM7qH1SBwtB0if9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
