He drinks the concoction down in one swallow and also manages to outsmart Dot's boss and his rum-running hooligans. You see, Dingo is a bootlegger himself. He literally sweeps the lady off her feet and they set up housekeeping in a tropical hotel full of colorful characters, some of whom are in the bootlegging business too.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d8QlW4pPlvsRtk8XS3ukZxO4f5J.jpg", "actors": ["Evelyn Brent (Dorothy 'Dot' Hunter)", "Conrad Nagel (Ernest Todd)", "Charles Bickford (Dingo Mike)", "Roland Young (Dr. Heath)", "William Farnum (Malcolm 'Mal' Todd)", "Lucile Gleason (Nellie)", "Leslie Fenton (Gerald 'Gerry' Willis)", "Gwen Lee (Gwen Willis)", "Wallace MacDonald (Francisco)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
