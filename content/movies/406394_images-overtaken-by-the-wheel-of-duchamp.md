For example, blackening in the spokes of a wheel, allowing regular slits, transforming it in this way into a true external shutter, that came to substitute for the missing one of my movie camera. A bicycle wheel that becomes cinema and vice versa. For example, his black window that is transformed into a number of tv screens, etc. With Duchamp I think I could make a film for every one of his works because intelligence, irony and alchemy are all proper to the cinema.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sr8kvFtAhoBuDQg1LzRYt7F6q6e.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
