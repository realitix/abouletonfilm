After two weeks rehearsal in Los Angeles, seventeen people climbed aboard a tour bus for thirty North American and nine European shows. Headlined by cLOUDDEAD, the bill also included Reaching Quiet (backed by a full band), Boom Bip &amp; Doseone, Radioinactive (with his Pyramidi all-stars band in full costume), and Labtekwon. The final two shows in the US were in San Francisco at The Great American Music Hall and Los Angeles at the El Rey. Both shows were professionally recorded and have been mixed down along with candid footage shot during the rest of the tour for a ninety minute DVD. The tracklist includes songs from the artist's Mush releases and is a testament to the amazing live show and hard work that made Mush's first tour an overwhelming success.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/409z1goGfJH25nW6XasZGpharn4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
