Each of the nine channels shows a musician or group of musicians, including some of Iceland\u2019s most renowned as well as members of the family that owns Rokeby Farm, performing in a separate space in the storied house and grounds; each wears headphones to hear the others.  As the music begins and repeats, individual players stop, start, and move between rooms. Viewed together, the individual videos present an ensemble performance Kjartansson calls a \u201cfeminine nihilistic gospel song.\u201d The piece itself sets lyrics from a poem by artist \u00c1sd\u00eds Sif Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir, Ragnar\u00b4s ex-wife, to a musical arrangement by the artist and Icelandic musician Dav\u00ed\u00f0 \u00de\u00f3r J\u00f3nsson; the title comes from a 1981 album from Swedish pop band ABBA, meant to be its last.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qdyVO0B6ScwznoQ4nNCI3VViknZ.jpg", "actors": ["Dav\u00ed\u00f0 \u00de\u00f3r J\u00f3nsson (Self)", "\u00deorvaldur Gr\u00f6ndal (Self)", "Kjartan Sveinsson (Self)", "Ragnar Kjartansson (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
