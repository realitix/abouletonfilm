He is in mission control as the astronauts go through their final launch simulation, and he flies with the last shuttle commander as he undertakes his last practice landing flight. Kevin also gains privileged access to the shuttle itself, visiting the launchpad in the company of the astronaut who will guide the final flight from mission control.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/23KvEU6ZeYAOxofw9ZLakvA7zyi.jpg", "actors": ["Kevin Fong (Presenter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "4djhwT_G3lI"}
