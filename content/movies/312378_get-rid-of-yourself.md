While its initial sounds and images were filmed during the riots in Genoa, 2001, these materials are pulled apart and recomposed in order to locate the intensity of a shared experience, rather than producing one more documentary version of the programmed and hyper-mediatized confrontation of the G8 counter-summit. Elaborating a complex and rhythmic form of address via sound/image disjunctions, cheap video effects and performance, the film declares its own exile from a biopolitical space-time where nothing ever happens. The crisis it announces is the sudden return of history, but this time without characters or a story, and of a politics without subjects.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nsmn74GccBuxpEx6yLWomgHalLq.jpg", "actors": ["Chlo\u00eb Sevigny ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
