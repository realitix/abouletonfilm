The owner of the boarding house, Sookmyung, is tired of her busy husband picking out the type in the narrow printing shop room every day, so he ludicrously seduces him. Deckman moves the house, but skepticism stubbornly searches for him. Deckman throws himself away more easily than the first, because he gives up the rented house and draws him to his house. However, the virtue of being humiliated by the slave of the castle is no longer able to bear the burden. Duk-man, who throws away everything and goes out into the streets and wipes out the glass of high-rise buildings, registers for the new semester and tells the friends' petitions about the pain.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rIOcUSWQV89rws3eN0BzgCI0RbE.jpg", "actors": ["Kim Se-jun ()", "Kim Hyung-ja ()", "Jin-hwa Kim ()", "Mu-song Jeon ()", "Jin-mi Kim ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
