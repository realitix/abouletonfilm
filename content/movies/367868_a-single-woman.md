Deliciously political, occasionally chilling, ironic and idiosyncratic, A Single Woman illuminates the role of the individual in the American legislative process with a whimsical amalgamation of storytelling, high-powered discourse and communion. The program is a filmed version of the successful stage play.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yYvS1WbEnhSItH52f6BfF5pg78b.jpg", "actors": ["Jeanmarie Simpson (Jeannette Rankin)", "Patricia Arquette (Storyteller)", "Joyce Julianne Auer (Carrie Chapman Catt)", "Karen Black (Storyteller)", "Traber Burns (Harry Truman / Sam Rayburn / Newspaper Editor)", "Kate Connor (Alice Paul)", "Peter Coyote (Maury Maverick)", "Cameron Crain (70's Anchorman / Georgia Congressman / 1917 Reporter)", "Frances Fisher (Narrator / Suffragist)", "Richard Fisher (John McCormack)", "Barry Ford (Uncle Joe Cannon)", "Andy Hirsch (W.W.I Reporter)", "Shyla Huber (Katharine Anthony)", "Mimi Kennedy (Storyteller)", "Margot Kidder (Storyteller)", "Cassidy Lehrman (Young Jeannette Rankin)", "Qing Lin (Chinese Girl)", "Qxing Lin (Chinese Girl)", "Joel Marshall (John Raker)", "Judd Nelson (Jewish Reporter)", "Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a (Storyteller)", "Jeremy Radin (Fiorello LaGuardia)", "Mary Kay Riley (Belle Fleigelman Weinstein / Jeanette's Mother)", "Cindy Sheehan (Storyteller)", "Jeffrey J.
