They discover a practically untouched site with a unique giant arch filled with limestone tufas. The project takes shape with the agreement of the government and the Chinese Mountaineering Association. It takes a group of climbers two trips to put up 250 new routes of all levels. During the Petzl RocTrip, hundreds of Chinese and visiting climbers get together to climb these routes. The highlight of the event is when the Spaniard Dani Andrada sends his project, Corazon de Ensueno. In front of a big crowd, he frees the extremely difficult eight pitches, all tied in with his partner, Chris Sharma. Since then, the Getu Valley has become a prime climbing destination, thanks to the magnificent routes and to the warm and authentic hospitality of the valley's inhabitants.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/slQkYYOMuq2NmeUCfLEYfTX0ENS.jpg", "actors": ["Chris Sharma ()", "Daila Ojeda ()", "Dani Andrada ()", "Dave Graham ()", "Lynn Hill ()", "Arnaud Petit ()", "Daniel Du lac ()", "Liv Sansoz ()", "Philippe Ribi\u00e8re ()", "Tony Lamiche ()", "Nina Caprez ()", "Sa\u00efd Belhaj ()", "Florence Pinet ()", "Gabriele Moroni ()", "Mayan Smith-Gobat ()", "St\u00e9phanie Bodet ()", "Tatsuni Nitta ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
