Erik (Thomas Eje) is newly divorced and a depressed, despairing man who arrives in Greenland after his brother died in a hang-gliding accident. He eventually moves in with an Inuit woman Soerine (Naja Rosing Olsen) and her son Nikki, whom Erik suspects is his dead brother's child. His search and suspicions are punctuated by other subsidiary, mini-dramas, and long, sweeping vistas of the ice-bound landscape.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lmg6CEDTZwIzNEiL05OuIBbaKoz.jpg", "actors": ["Thomas Eje (Erik)", "Naja Rosing Olsen (S\u00f8rine)", "Rasmus Lyberth (Rasmus)", "Benedikte Schmidt (Elizabeth)", "Rasmus Thygesen (Otto)", "Agga Geisler (Anna)", "Erik Holmey (Bruno)", "Knud L\u00f8vstr\u00f8m ()", "B\u00f8ye L\u00f8vstr\u00f8m ()", "Roar \u00d8rum ()", "Bo N\u00f8rreslet ()", "Isak Lothsen ()", "Bernhard Guldager ()", "Lisbeth Gissing Christiansen ()", "Peter Hendriksen ()", "Pavia Petersen ()", "Therkil Pjettursson ()", "Ruth Bl\u00fcthmann ()", "Frederikke Jeremiassen ()", "Nikolaj Kristiansen ()", "Ivalu N\u00f8rreslet ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
