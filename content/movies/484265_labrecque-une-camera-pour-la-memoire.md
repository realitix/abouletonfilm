The bond between Labrecque and director Michel La Veaux allows us to see beyond the images and discover the smaller story hidden within the larger one. La Veaux shares with us his own love for film and the humanistic perspective from which Labrecque has used his camera to etch the great moments of Quebec\u2019s culture and history into Quebecers\u2019 collective memory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dJWQ0vduDbsEDXGzfaaTJvLyDMs.jpg", "actors": ["Jean-Claude Labrecque (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
