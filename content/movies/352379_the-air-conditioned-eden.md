The archival footage features highlights such as Martin Denny\u2019s first live performance on the Dinah Shore show. To actually SEE Augie Colon voice those birdcalls is an unforgettable moment. Martin is also interviewed in the film, and we see one of the last interviews with James Michener. Original footage of the Disneyland Tiki room and the Kon Tiki voyage further document important Tiki moments in history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aBX26vQbZG4nGIYQioPPoOQUeFw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
