Within 50 years, that population was cut in half as Western diseases claimed thousands of lives. A litany of events followed: American missionaries preached unfamiliar ideas and customs; sugarcane and pineapple plantations absorbed individual farmlands; waves of immigrant workers arrived, making Hawaiians a minority in their own land; and WWII brought a lasting military presence. University of Hawai'i sociologists estimate that the extinction of full-blooded Hawaiians could come within the next 45 years.  This compelling story of a race displaced and now on the verge of extinction is brilliantly told in this award-winning documentary created by the great-granddaughter of Hawaiian high chiefs and English seafarers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9KxDr3gY9ncEJ8wI91RMneL9hey.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "fAmK2LQ0sWc"}
