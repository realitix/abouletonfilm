{"tmdb_id": 217596, "title": "Prague", "original_title": "Prague", "slug_title": "prague", "date": "2013-09-26", "genre": [""], "score": "5.8/10", "synopsis": "A city with a history of heritage, myth and superstition. A passionate architect with strong but delusional ideas about love and life. A Czech gypsy girl searching for her identity and true love. Add to the drama of a mean friend you can\u2019t do without and cannot trust either. The conflict of these complex characters is further heightened with illusions of someone who is there but at the same time not there- what you see is not true? or is the truth, what you not see? All of the above are thrown together in a very unique and unusual situation where you do not know what to believe and what to disbelieve.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wq7fu9AUMJIXbdLnL8fr7hM28cq.jpg", "actors": ["Arfi Lamba (Arfi)", "Elena Kazan (Elena)", "Barbora J\u00e1nov\u00e1 (Amy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
