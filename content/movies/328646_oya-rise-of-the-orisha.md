Disconnected from the natural essence of Orixa. Fuelled by hate, war and destruction. This world teeters on chaos. This world needs change. This world needs Oya: Orisha of the hurricane, goddess of the wind. Step into her world, as Oya goes on a mission to stop a lunatic, intent on killing an innocent.  If change is to come.

The Orisha must rise.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3weun68ofSV0wrUBqoI5n4QRmka.jpg", "actors": ["Ethosheia Hylton (Oya)", "Ethosheia Hylton (The Leader)", "Jayde Stedford (Rebecca)", "Quincy Okpokpor (Mot)", "Luiana Bonfim (Tanit)", "Orwi Imanuel Ameh (Eshu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "CMbJdFjpVfg"}
