A new gadget, the myth-enshrouded RED BOOK, offers the ultimate gaming experience. The most secret longings of gamers are scanned by the engine and transformed into fantastic adventures. The conspiracy psychoses of users are the raw material for the storytelling of NEUROO-X. Marcus, Chief Development Manager of NEUROO-X dies shortly before completion of the RED BOOK. His lover Ryuko finds out that something terrible happened during testing of the game in China, and the deeper she submerges into the secret of NEUROO-X, the more she loses touch with reality. She neglects her son Walter, who logs into the game and disappears into the digital parallel world. The more Ryuko fights the corporation in order to rescue her son, the more she updates the narrative desired by NEUROO-X. Ryuko finds herself in a world full of demons, witches, knights and terrorists.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8EDzJwpW47ZQFVKraHMPtr28eZD.jpg", "actors": ["Christoph Bach (Marcus)", "Arnold Bucher (Techniker)", "Nina Fog (Ryuko)", "Philippe Graber (Stauffacher)", "Julian M.
