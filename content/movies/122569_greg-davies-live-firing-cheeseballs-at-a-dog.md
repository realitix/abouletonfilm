His hotly anticipated debut stand-up show was a critically lauded sell-out smash hit at the 2010 Edinburgh festival, picking up a prestigious nomination for the Fosters Comedy Award (formerly the Perrier). Following a sell-out autumn tour and a spring 2011 extension added due to popular demand, now\u2019s your chance to see this incredible stand-up show, live on DVD. It promises to address every single issue important to the human race. But it lies - it won\u2019t address any. Buy it though, it\u2019ll be funny.  ***** Mail on Sunday  ***** The Independent  ***** Sunday Telegraph  ***** Chortle  ***** Time Out", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8QMkNRYsXG1dN5osaC6hYWGog5z.jpg", "actors": ["Greg Davies (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
