He heads out into the woods and finds himself at the place where several brutal murders appear to have occurred. He tidies up a bit and carries on, coming across a group out for a nature talk which descends quickly into horror and religion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6JcwX6ouReftpD0kFWtjwrxTuEP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
