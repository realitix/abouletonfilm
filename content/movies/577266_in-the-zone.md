In 2011 he launched The InZone Project; its aim was to transform the lives of disadvantaged M\u0101ori and Pasifika teens by moving them into supportive homes, in zones that enable them to receive opportunities at top Auckland schools like Auckland Grammar. Director Robyn Paterson (Finding Mercy) follows Wallace as he attempts to take the programme back to his hometown of Chicago. Paterson developed the project after winning a 2015 pitching competition at Kiwi documentary festival Doc Edge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vM9OehKtrNZoB9H5dkUl7wj7Ijb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
