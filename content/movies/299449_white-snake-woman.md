As she turns to face the crowd, the woman reveals the disfigured right side of her face. As the procession stands in utter horror, the ghost then takes flight again and down a side street. After the shock wears off, the bride is checked on and everyone is safe in the group. Once the wedding party finally arrives at the groom's home, they apologize for the delay... and proceed to open the kago, only to realize that the bride-to-be is now missing... and all that's left in the carriage is a single white snake slithering about.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zMdbA2mW5HipIQcXOJyFjf9Kfn1.jpg", "actors": ["Shoji Umewaka ()", "Tamao Nakamura ()", "Ikuko M\u00f4ri ()", "Toshio Chiba ()", "Sentaro Izumi ()", "Rumiko Komachi ()", "Teruyo Asagumo ()", "Shinobu Araki ()", "Hiroshi Ueda ()", "Yasuhiko Shima ()", "Hiroshi Mizuno ()", "Sh\u00f4z\u00f4 Nanbu ()", "Ichiro Amano ()", "Seishir\u00f4 Hara ()", "Mitsusabur\u00f4 Ramon ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
