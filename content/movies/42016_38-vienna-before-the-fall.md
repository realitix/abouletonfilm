When we encounter the couple in the lovely springtime weather their future is full of promise. They are determined to stay clear of politics. Yet in the climate of the time, nobody of her prominence or his religion can remain apolitical. Although Martin's journalist friend, Drechsler, calls to inform them that the Nazis plan to take over Austria soon, they concentrate on their work and their private happiness and dismiss the warnings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bRnJ2TAcD7drqwFj59TYH0aXSLf.jpg", "actors": ["Tobias Engel (Martin)", "Sunnyi Melles (Carola)", "Heinz Trixner (Toni)", "Romuald Pekny (Sovary)", "Ingrid Burkhard (Frau Schostal)", "David Cameron (Oberst)", "Josef Fr\u00f6hlich (Kemetter)", "Tanja von Oertzen (Frau von Wartenburg)", "Lotte Ledl (Carola's Mother)", "Walter Starz (Sollnau)", "Lukas Resetarits (Cabdriver)", "Gerhard Bronner ()", "Miguel Herz-Kestranek ()", "Michael Kehlmann ()", "Ulf Dieter Kusdas ()", "Maria Singer ()", "Peter Uray ()", "Christoph Schobesberger ()", "Eduard Erne ()", "Gerhard Swoboda ()", "Undine Brixner ()", "Dieter Witting ()", "Ulrich Faulhaber ()", "Hermann Schmid ()", "Adolf Bur ()", "Robert Hauer-Riedl ()", "Adolf Wessely ()", "Jan Skope\u010dek ()", "Viktor Maurer ()", "Andre Stanicic ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [93865], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
