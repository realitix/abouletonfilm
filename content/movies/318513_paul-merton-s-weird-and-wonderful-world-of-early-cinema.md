Revealing the unknown stars and lost masterpieces, he brings to life the pioneering techniques and optical inventiveness of the virtuosos who mastered a new art form. With a playful eye and comic sense of timing, Merton combines the role of presenter and director to recreate the weird and wonderful world that is early European cinema in a series of cinematic experiments of his own.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hZtjPFlPk0J1s3H0FPtfnzfYg3S.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Merton (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
