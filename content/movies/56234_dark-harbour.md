When a sign is posted advertising a matchmaking party with city women, all the men gussy themselves up and videotape themselves for the dating service. Manzo borrows a camcorder and tries his luck, but his rehearsed speech doesn't go as planned. When showing the videotape to the prospective dates, he discovers something unusual: There is a woman and her son living in one of his closets. Instead of kicking them out, he encourages them to stay and develops a relationship with them that makes the other fishermen jealous.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lpwhV2pjOSVt0UoqxYdBHSIrefs.jpg", "actors": ["Kazuki Hiro'oka ()", "Shinya Kote ()", "Akaji Maro ()", "Yuko Miyamoto ()", "Terumi Norizuki (Wife)", "Y\u00fbjir\u00f4 Taki ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [118613], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
