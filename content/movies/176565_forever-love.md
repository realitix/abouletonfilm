When her filmmaker grandfather, Liu Chi-Sheng, lands in hospital, 18-year-old Jie has him recount the love story between him and her grandmother, Chiang Mei-Yue, that happened during a visit of the film sets of Beitou. Told in sweetly campy cinema flashbacks and semi-animated inserts, Forever Love is a love letter to Taiwanese cinema as much as it is a romance for the ages.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ypqGdaFVq7uEmkmnK6ihTFnLQNl.jpg", "actors": ["Lan Cheng-lung ()", "Amber An ()", "Wang Bo-Chieh (Wan Pao-lung)", "Lung Shao-Hua ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
