From the daring, benchmark sounds of `Desafinado' (partly responsible for launching the Bossa craze in the 1950's) to Jobim's most philosophical classic `Aguas de Mar\u00e7o' (Waters of March), the intricate yet always engaging and enveloping sound of Jobim's music makes this concert a standout.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f65iDcOts3v7qm6p0tbXf1zDw9o.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
