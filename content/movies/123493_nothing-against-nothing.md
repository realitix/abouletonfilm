In order to weigh up the possible risks, they gatecrash a meeting of their contemporaries who grew up in adoptive families and contacted each other via internet chat rooms. A group of thirty-somethings get together at a campsite for a few days in order to set up an association in support of adoption. Despite their shared fate and \"noble\u201d intentions, the members of this small community don\u2019t hit it off. Where does pretentious tolerance end and buck-passing indifference begin? And what has decent morality got in common with xenophobia? As an ironic reflection that questions how prepared we should be to help each other out, the film offers a sophisticated and poetic take on the grimly authentic style of the Dogme 95 Manifesto. This satirical comedy was the result of collaboration with the L\u00c1HOR/Soundsystem theatre group, which focuses on realistic collective stage improvisation within the structure of a predetermined story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yZ8iuvWyUkmQhIRb1OGSzE5Ccks.jpg", "actors": ["Johana \u0160varcov\u00e1 (Johana)", "Radek Rub\u00e1\u0161 (Radek)", "Marian Mo\u0161t\u00edk (Marian)", "Kamila Davidov\u00e1 (Kamila)", "Marta Pila\u0159ov\u00e1 (Marta)", "Ji\u0159\u00ed Najvert (Ji\u0159\u00ed)", "Petr Marek (Petr)", "Ji\u0159\u00ed Nezhyba (Ji\u0159\u00ed)", "Prokop Holoubek (Prokop)", "Zden\u011bk Hude\u010dek (Zden\u011bk)", "Patrik Hronek (Patrik)", "Keny Zjizmoch (Keny)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "7_9B8JQ069U"}
