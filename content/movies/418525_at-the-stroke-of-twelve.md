Racketeer Lance McGowan, on the night he has decided to go straight, finds himself caught between the gunfire of two rival gangsters and, wounded by a bullet, he finds refuge in the home of a wealthy recluse. One of the gangsters is found riddled with bullets from the gun Lance dropped while making his escape, and he is arrested and tried for murder. The reclusive widow comes to the trail and testifies that Lance was her guest that night when the clock struck twelve, the time of the killing. Lance, while innocent, is also lucky, as the widow had her all her clocks set to always strike twelve, as the time her husband had died.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Craig Stevens (Lane McGowan)", "Elisabeth Risdon (Abigail Osley, aka The Old Doll)", "Knox Manning (Carson)", "Howard Da Silva (Angie the Ox)", "Ben Welden (Babe)", "Frank Ferguson (Prosecuting Attorney)", "Eddie Dunn (Policeman)", "Faye Emerson (Miss LaMond)", "Fred Kelsey (Police Sergeant)", "John Ridgely (Reporter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
