It marked the end of a very prolific phase of actions that followed the legendary Art and Revolution action by the Viennese Actionists in Vienna in 1968. As a result of this performance, Muehl and G\u00fcnter Brus were prosecuted and could no longer exhibit publicly in Austria.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7jjmb0mg1n4xh6I3s2cfFAvB4UU.jpg", "actors": ["Romilla Doll ()", "Mica Most ()", "Otto Muehl ()", "Herbert Stumpfl ()", "Charlotte Moorman (Cello)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
