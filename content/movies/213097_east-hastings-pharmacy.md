The architecture of the space is as much a character as the population which passes through it, with borders of glass between the street and the pharmacy and then between the pharmacist and her clients. The tension of the situation and the struggles on both sides of the glass are punctuated with moments of good humour and camaraderie.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
