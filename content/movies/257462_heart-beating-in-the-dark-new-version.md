It is both those things, and at the same time it is also a documentary, a portrait of the consequences of passing time, and an occasionally very funny reflection on what the hell the point is of all this filmmaking business anyway. Shigeru Muroi and Takashi Naito, back then young hopefuls willing to take chances, now among the most established and recognisable actors in Japan, return to play the roles they assumed in the 1982 film, each of their characters having gone their own way. Alongside, another young couple (Honda and the ever-brilliant Eguchi) find themselves in the exact same situation as their older counterparts 25 years earlier. Their paths cross, an opportunity arises: for the elder two to redeem part of their own lives, for the younger couple to find a helping hand in their darkest hour.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rf8UKMG3rX7yRbTkF0RL97w9pVT.jpg", "actors": ["Takashi Naito (Ringo)", "Shigeru Muroi (Inako)", "Shoichi Honda (Toru)", "Noriko Eguchi (Yuki)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
