The title refers to an anecdote my father told me about his childhood- at five years of age, these were the words my father used to tell his own father that men had come and turned off their electricity. My father died of cancer shortly before Brakhage did- making this a film was a gesture for the both of them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mhNqoPLAy2rtVTE1D6caiW7DZuy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
