Here a group of performers of all stripes \u2013 the sink and litter basket receive equal billing to the human actors \u2013 are forced into Warhol and Tavel\u2019s cruelly comical theatre of the absurd. Inside this cramped domestic space, boredom, confusion and a sense of existential dread hang heavy in the air.
