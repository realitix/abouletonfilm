She wants to still study and wants to enroll in his school in Hong Kong. The head of the school agrees to this under the condition that they conceal the fact that they are married. Zhenzhen finds out right away that her husband is fawned over by the girls, they all have a crush on him, as also does the spinster librarian. However, Mr. Lin finds that that the boys in the school (they are late teens, 17 or so) really like Zhenzhen. This leads to hurt feelings, questions about fidelity and even, in Zhenzhen's case, innocuous dates with one of the boys who rides a motorcycle.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rEERRMB3kTJYeSQYSeSAbbExqUa.jpg", "actors": ["Li Ching ()", "Ling Yun ()", "Chang Pei-Shan ()", "Ling Ling ()", "Gam Tin-Chue (Teacher)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
