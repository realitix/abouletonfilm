But due to the fact that he likes very much to live an extravagant life amidst bad company, he spoils his life. A victim of a dirty trick by one of his supposed friends, he goes to prison for a crime he never committed. It will be there, thanks to the prison's clergyman, that Herr Redmond finally is able to get back his well-mannered life. Thanks to newfound faith, he becomes a clergyman too - preaching the gospel and using his life as a bad example. In this way, he helps the poor people who live a more miserable life accustomed as they are to the slums rather than his elegant districts.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b8swwOSYuV32PJghk5c2jV1mcdJ.jpg", "actors": ["Valdemar Psilander (John Redmond - The Evangelist)", "Philip Bech (Judge)", "Augusta Blad (Mrs. Redmond - John's Mother)", "Axel Boesen (Convict / Party Guest)", "Else Fr\u00f6lich (A Floosy)", "Alma Hinding (Nelly Gray - Seamstress)", "Frederik Jacobsen (Mr. Redmond - Bank Manager)", "Peter J\u00f8rgensen ()", "Svend Kornbeck (Ironfist / Charley)", "Oscar Nielsen ()", "Ingeborg Olsen ()", "Johannes Ring (Vicar)", "Carl Schenstr\u00f8m ()", "Robert Schyberg ()", "Birger von Cotta-Sch\u00f8nberg (Billy Sanders)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
