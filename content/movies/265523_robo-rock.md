He is freeloading off his girlfriend Kiriko, who works as a tattoo artist. One day, he is offered to do a rather eccentric job from an otaku-looking public employee named Nirasawa, who claims that Masaru\u2019s voice is necessary in activating a giant robot named Land Zeppelin. He goes on straight-faced that the Earth is about to be attacked by Saturnians, and the robot is necessary in the fight against them. At first, Masaru ignores this far-fetched story, but one day he is framed in a dangerous job he takes on together with his friend Kou, and is driven into a tight squeeze. What will happen to Masaru? Does this robot Land Zeppelin really exist?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c0DcPZeq7TNVOElipL7pz1kcyVb.jpg", "actors": ["Minami (Kiriko)", "Shun Shioya (Masaru Hagiwara)", "Yuichiro Nakayama (Etsuro Nirasawa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "CrvQgJJvsvE"}
