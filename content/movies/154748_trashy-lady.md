Harry Reems plays mobster, Dutch Siegel, who has just been dumped by his filthy mouthed girlfriend, Cara Lott. Shortly after, he falls for the new cigarette girl, Ginger Lynn, whom he meets at his posh club. Dutch wants Kitty as his dame, but a problem exists - she's too classy for him. Kitty is a lady and Dutch likes his dames trashy. He employs a local whore, Rita, played by Amber Lynn, to teach Kitty the 'right' ways to act. His problems are compounded when another local mobster, Big Louie decides to take revenge against Dutch because he believes that he's been sleeping with his girl, sparking a small gang war.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pERNa1je6fswGVN8iVBi4FRB5p2.jpg", "actors": ["Ginger Lynn Allen (Kitty)", "Harry Reems (Dutch)", "Cara Lott (Jessie)", "Amber Lynn (Rita)", "Herschel Savage (Louie)", "Steve Drake (Tony)", "Tom Byron (Jimmy)", "Bunny Bleu (Norma)", "Marc Wallice (Rocky)", "Francois Papillon (Boxer)", "Cheri Janvier (Emma)", "Rick Savage (Eddie)", "Joe Massey (Jasper)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
