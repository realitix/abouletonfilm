Karl \u00c5ge is quiet, detached; Regitze is spirited, lively. He thinks back: love at first sight during the war, living together unmarried, her mother's hunger strike when they won't baptize their son. Regitze is passionate and forthright; she speaks her mind. He remembers her inviting a derelict for Christmas dinner, and the man shows up with five bashful friends. He recalls her taking on their son's teacher when the man slaps the lad. He remembers her love of dancing and his fear that his social clumsiness might end their relationship. Now, in twilight, he has other things to face.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dUdippgqxkC7uXlbkBmAYTxcbKH.jpg", "actors": ["Frits Helmuth (Karl Aage (Regitze's Husband))", "Ghita N\u00f8rby (Regitze)", "Henning Moritzen (Borge)", "Rikke Bendsen (Young Regitze)", "Mikael Helmuth (Young Karl Aage)", "Michael Moritzen (Young Borge)", "Anne Werner Thomsen (Isle)", "Dorthe Simone Lang (Young Ilse)", "Henning Ditlev (Rikard)", "Kim R\u00f8mer (Young Rikard)", "Birgit Sadolin (Annie)", "Nanna M\u00f8ller (Young Annie)", "Hans Henrik Clemensen ()", "Peter Zhelder ()", "Sylvester Zimsen ()", "Kirsten Rolffes ()", "Birgit Zinn ()", "Torben Jensen ()", "Poul Clemmensen ()", "Tove Ma\u00ebs ()", "Lise Kamp Dahlerup ()", "Sune Carlsson K\u00f8lster ()", "Jane Eggertsen ()", "Asger Bonfils ()", "Timm Mehrens ()", "Hans Henrik B\u00e6rentzen ()", "Else Petersen ()", "Peter Andreas Dam ()", "Bolette Schr\u00f8der ()", "Anne Fletting ()", "S\u00f8ren Koch Nielsen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [56888], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
