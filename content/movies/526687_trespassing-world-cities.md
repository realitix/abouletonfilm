This is a travel journal in the literal sense of the term. The video records my walking through a dozen of major cities around the world, repeating routes and activities, between 1999 and 2005. The mythology of the multiple colors of diverse world cultures shatters. I found myself doing the same things, repeating places I have visited, and inside my mind is often a totally different world irrelevant to the places I visit. Globalization is a popular catch word, the token of economism. Personally speaking, it is a form of irony.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eyAvDPLR7Y45L4RHxiCXibNqBLD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
