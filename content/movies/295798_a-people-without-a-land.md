Typically, this is formulated as an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and the establishment of a Palestinian state there and in the Gaza Strip. Unfortunately, with half a million Israeli settlers living throughout the West Bank and millions of Palestinian refugees demanding to return to their homes in Israel, the two-state solution no longer seems practical, let alone just. \"A People Without a Land\" explores the notion that the only real solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a one-state solution. Spending time with people from across the political spectrum, including settlers, politicians, activists and unique individuals who have successfully crossed the ethnic divide, we explore the challenges that lie ahead as well as the possibilities that such a solution might entail.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6C39XH6lqrWpQCUaFum0CjCOOFX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
