The toy nearly hits schoolgirl Siu Ching, but she is saved by the fast response of Fatty Cheng. Siu Ching's eighth birthday soon arrives, but her ill and overworked mother has a sudden attack, and Siu Ching must go out in the rain to buy more medicine. By coincidence, the managers of the same toy factory are in the car who knock her over on the road and then run away, without reporting the accident.
