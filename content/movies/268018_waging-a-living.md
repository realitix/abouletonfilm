If you work full time, you should not be poor, but more than 30 million Americans - one in four workers - are stuck in low wage jobs that do not provide the basics for a decent life. WAGING A LIVING chronicles the battle of four low-wage workers to lift their families out of poverty. Shot over a three-year period in the northeast and California, this observational documentary captures the dreams, frustrations, and accomplishments of a diverse group of workers who struggle to live from paycheck to paycheck. By presenting an unvarnished look at the barriers that these workers must overcome to escape poverty, WAGING A LIVING offers a sobering view of the elusive American Dream.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cRnT7SnFeY1iBWLqIhztQ47wdsD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
