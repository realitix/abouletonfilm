No story is too horrific, no circumstance too dire, no kid too damaged for its tireless director, Captain Paul Moulds. Father figure, counselor, saviour and an orphan himself, Paul is nothing short of a legend amongst those who stumble in at breaking point with nowhere left to go. This raw observational documentary filmed over two years captures Paul's daily battle to save these lost children of the so-called \"Lucky Country\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2ZkmNJ7tuKOZfrzYXJiL5lvXwQN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
