Upon his arrival, he discovers that his father has decided to leave for the province but he opted to stay in Manila for a vacation. One day, he meets Stella, a nude model originally scheduled to pose for Miguel's father. Struck by her beauty, Miguel does the unthinkable - he pretends to be his father the painter. Developing a relationship based on a lie, things turn for the worse as Stella begets a strange skin disease that turns off Miguel. Surrounded by strange characters - a talking cow, a talkative mailman and a nosy landlady - Miguel is driven into a frenzy realization about beauty, lust, love and being true to oneself. An ambiguous ending underlines the surreal tone of the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a6rt03xGTC38XGghkHoSG79Nxjd.jpg", "actors": ["Yul Servo (Miguel)", "Jennifer Lee (Tess)", "J.C.
