While his devoted father and mother were exiled to Hawaii, seven-year-old Joseph was left alone for several years to mature. A historian for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at age 25, Joseph defended the faith as a scholar and prolific writer over the next 70 years. Through his lifelong commitment as theologian, apostle, and Prophet of God, he helped the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints grow to be a worldwide religion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zhX5fnkeTNVT2vsWFKtJWhv1Vnt.jpg", "actors": ["Scott Wilkinson (Pres.
