The level of media saturation we\u2019re bombarded with creates an absurd distortion and distance between our daily routine and current affairs. D\u00e9montable explores this bizarre melange of realities by throwing the two worlds together: attack helicopters shred a newspaper, while a dinner plate suffers a drone strike. They\u2019re a series of attempts to try and understand our world better by playing with its violent protagonists", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ytxR1UV3V788BEFzN1L1tyWQUCJ.jpg", "actors": ["Douwe Dijkstra (unnamed)", "Jesse Strikwerda (unnamed)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
