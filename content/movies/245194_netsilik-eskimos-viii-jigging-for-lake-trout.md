The family makes an excursion for fresh fish from a lake. They build a karmak and move in the furs, cooking troughs, etc. The woman sets up her lamp, spreads the furs and attends to the children. There are signs of returning wildlife. The man moves out on the lake ice and chips a hole for fishing. He baits his hook and lowers it jigging the line to attract the fish. Crouched by the hole, he persists with his purpose and takes some fish, as does his wife who has joined him. Both remain at the hole through a severe blizzard.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xNywOe11k5ExFVep6Asywcssu5m.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
