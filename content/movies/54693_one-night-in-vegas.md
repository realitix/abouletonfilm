At this point in his career, Tyson\u2019s fights had become somewhat of a cultural phenomenon, where the ever present hype of the professional boxing scene would come face to face with the worlds of big business, Hollywood, and hip hop. Sitting ringside was controversial rapper Tupac Shakur. Shakur and Tyson were friends, a feeling of kinship linked them as each rose to stardom from poverty only to be thrown in prison. Following Tyson\u2019s victory, Shakur and \u201cIron Mike\u201d were to celebrate at an after party, but the rap star never arrived. Shakur was brutally gunned down later that night, and the scene in Las Vegas quickly turned from would-be celebratory revelry to ill fated and inopportune tragedy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tFNXYY94eAlyxPLhJA7w5stBw3j.jpg", "actors": ["Mike Tyson (himself)", "Ernest R.
