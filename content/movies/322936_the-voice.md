(All actors dub their lines for the master copy of a film.) But she is overcome by her own life-crisis that alters her plans -- just released from the hospital, she realizes that her illness is more than she can emotionally handle -- it will kill her eventually. Overwhelmed, she has to reconsider her simple task of dubbing from a completely new perspective. This film had an attendance of 2.3 million in the Soviet Union when it was released.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xwEhv0Dj1aiYv005ZYSY7Yosqhn.jpg", "actors": ["Natalya Sayko (\u042e\u043b\u044f \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u044b\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430)", "Leonid Filatov (\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0435\u0440)", "Giorgi Kalatozishvili (\u0441\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442)", "Yelizaveta Nikishchikhina (\u0410\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430)", "Vsevolod Shilovsky (\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u041a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432)", "Marina Yurasova (\u042d\u043f\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0434)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
