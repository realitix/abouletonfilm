The premise is simplicity itself: a woman waits for a call in her immaculate apartment. Comfortably immersed in her bath, she reveals a strange dream to the caller. Travis\u2019s calibrated formal manipulations work up a terrific surface suspense.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vVXitJ3Ecn48WevgB091opE6VNq.jpg", "actors": ["Courtenay Webber (Pauline)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
