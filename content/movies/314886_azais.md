Though he is never seen in the film, Azais's influences dictates every move made by Le Baron Wurtz (Max Dearly), a private tutor. Though he suffers quite a few setbacks, Wurtz presses on, armed by the Azaiz philosophy that every time something goes wrong in one part of the world, it is balanced by something going right elsewhere. This \"law of compensations\" pays off in big laughs for the audience, and in a happy-ever-after for Wurtz. Azais was based on a play by Georges Berr and Rene Verneuil.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vXY5JTQP6D0fy9OieidwphaZvzi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
