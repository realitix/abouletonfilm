In this morbid tragedy, in which everything revolves around the interior and exterior of man, not a word is said. A little boy gets a slice of sausage from that sweet blonde butcher's wife, whom he, in his exploratory innocence, disgraces in front of the callous clientele. The Roald Dahl-like aftermath is extremely delectable. 'May she live on in all of us.'", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xubdtezTZa5FaLBsyZUnl8zpiwI.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Gonlag ()", "Camilla Siegertsz ()", "Nils Verkooijen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
