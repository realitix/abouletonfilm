This is a film about the prison in which we never see an actual penitentiary. The film unfolds a cinematic journey through a series of landscapes across the USA where prisons do work and affect lives, from an anti-sex-offender pocket park in Los Angeles, to a congregation of ex-incarcerated chess players shut out of the formal labor market, to an Appalachian coal town betting its future on the promise of prison jobs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jdhr7T9X0EhLSaiOKOEOddgO3co.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "UgbXRN7ov4M"}
