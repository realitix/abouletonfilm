In their ancient society in the mountains of Laos, this hill tribe had no electricity, cars, or any other twentieth century technology. Their involvement with the CIA during the war forced the Mien to lose their homeland and resettle in the US. Coming here, they were catapulted from one century into another, shifting their ancient mountain homeland and the mindboggling complexities of Western, urban living\u2014everything from apartments and new food to freeways and shopping malls.
