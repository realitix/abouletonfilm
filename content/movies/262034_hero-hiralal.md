Things change when he meets with actress, Roopa, shows her around, and falls head-over-heels in love with her - so much so - when the unit leaves, he drives all the way to Bombay to be close to her. It is here that he will come to know that she has no similar feelings for him - and he will be thrown into contact with beautiful and manipulative actress, Sitara Devi, who has new and different role for him - one that will change his life forever.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v8h1rcZ7TIXCuFwXFsqhnoJpGw0.jpg", "actors": ["Naseeruddin Shah (Hero Hiralal)", "Sanjana Kapoor (Roopa)", "Deepa Sahi (Sitara Devi)", "Kiran Kumar (Prem Kumar)", "Rohini Hattangadi (Roopa's Mother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
