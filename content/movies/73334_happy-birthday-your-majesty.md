The death of the old lord Robert Andestend collects under one roof, in a family estate, his three nephews: bachelor bachelors who do not grieve too much for the deceased. Nephews learn that after the death of their rich uncle, they receive a huge inheritance - one million pounds sterling. But nephews will receive this sum only if they take three girls who live in the mansion of the old lord. If the nephews do not fulfill the condition, the whole legacy will pass to the old friend of the lord, the Russian general in retirement. The uncle complicated the task by saying that it is necessary to get married before a certain period - within two days. And nephews rush all the truths and crooks to get three \"golden\" brides.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8lUMDQxMV53leaWDa2D36rKWsBp.jpg", "actors": ["Sergei Makovetsky (Edward)", "Sergey Nikonenko (General Yedalov)", "Mikhail Svetin (Cameron)", "Emmanuil Vitorgan (Lord Understand)", "Dmitriy Isaev (George)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
