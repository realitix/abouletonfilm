Many Eons ago, the Orichalcum was split into three and landed on Earth. The metal then took the form of three relics: Skanda\u2019s Vajra, Jew\u2019s Cross, and the Sword of Alexander. Anyone able to re-unite these three Orichalcum relics would then obtain the powers of a God. Now two rival aliens are in a heated race to reunite the Orichalcum. They land in Edo era Tokyo where the relics are thought to exist.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gIPfPdFnMxp2vV1tY6aJb34aiUO.jpg", "actors": ["Hiroshi Abe (Genkurou)", "Kyoko Hasegawa (Princess Mai)", "Meisa Kuroki (Botan)", "Riki Takeuchi (Monk Grin)", "Ken'ichi End\u00f4 (Gonzou)", "Koji Okura (Teduma of Touji)", "Kazutoshi Yokoyama (Nobushi)", "Naomasa Musaka (Kuromushi)", "Masakatsu Funaki ()", "Hirotaro Honda ()", "Yu Tokui ()", "Ai Maeda ()", "Aya Sugimoto ()", "Shinnosuke Abe ()", "Inuko Inuyama ()", "Norihiko Hofuku ()", "Kankuro Kudo (Sasuke)", "Takashi Taniguchi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [17180, 10254, 17728, 21791], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
