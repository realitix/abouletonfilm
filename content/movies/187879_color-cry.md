He settled in the West Village, where he mixed with artists who later became the Abstract Expressionists, encouraged New York\u2019s emerging filmmakers such as Francis Lee, taught with Hans Richter, and assisted Ian Hugo on Bells of Atlantis. Color Cry was based on a development of the \u201crayogram\u201d or \u201cshadow cast\u201d process, using fabrics as stencils, with the images synchronized to a haunting blues song by Sonny Terry, which Lye imagined to be the anguished cry of a runaway slave. \u2014Harvard Film Archive", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4HIDaiWWnVryvKRRtv3ya8edTAQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [186164, 203087, 184402, 163890], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
