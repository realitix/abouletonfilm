His joy and excitement, however, turn into something darker when one of his neighbours (a sad, drunken man whose own children have recently thrown him out of the house) suggests a sordid future for both Vincent and his child. Something inside him snaps and he embarks on a pyschotic mission of 'close cleansing'. -Peter Mullan, Director  \"Close\" is a short film on the darker side of fatherhood, of paternal love swerving dangerously down the wrong path. The mood is disturbing, violent and darkly comic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4uWLjauyId79enoQGYJpYIGHssj.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Mullan (Vincent)", "Bob Carr (Alex)", "Gary Lewis (Fumigation Man)", "David McKay (Davie)", "Maureen Carr (Margaret)", "Andrew McKay (Boy at door)", "Jim McKay (Ian)", "Emily Winter (Vincent's Wife)", "Campbell Soutar (Policeman)", "Neill McCallum (Policeman)", "Conor Strike (Angel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
