In the game tanagram (literally \"seven boards of skill\") players are asked to arrange seven geometric elements to fit within a set of predetermined outlines. Staged over a soundtrack comprised of mock Russian folk music and a song from the Red Army Choir, Molska's athletic performers converse in Russian using semi-incoherent lines of dialog lifted from a Polish to Russian phrase book, while creating shapes against the white background of the studio floor: one of which bears a striking resemblance to Kazimir Malevich's landmark Black Square (1915). Inflected by the parodic soundtrack and the flawless bodies that suggest Soviet-era ideals of the perfect worker, Tanagram is a send-up, if not a conflation, of Constructivist and Soviet-style utopian ideals.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wamJAK6sVpsKL2N7U2LBBXy0PhO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
