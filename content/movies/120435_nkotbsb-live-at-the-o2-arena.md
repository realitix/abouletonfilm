The April 29th live show at the world-famous O2 Arena featuring two of the biggest pop bands of the last 20 years, New Kids on the Block and The Backstreet Boys, has also set a milestone. The show was broadcast all over the world via live stream.  NKOTBSB first shocked and delighted fans when they took the stage together for a medley at the sold out NKOTB Radio City Music Hall show. The two groups wowed audiences again in their first joint televised performance at the American Music Awards almost a year ago in November 2010 and have toured consistently through 2011 since coming together.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tpauifYqYVuzJqMmPSZVxV16PaR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
