What used to be a thriving port city where a variety of religions and ethnicities could convene in peace has become a land torn apart by factions. Dutch director Jack Janssen\u2019s rich tapestry weaves together several Beirut denizens who have survived their country\u2019s recent troubled past. Though they are all different in their confusion, anger and loss, one powerful common thread ties them together: the enchanting, mystical voice of Fairuz. The most famous singer, and arguably the most popular cultural icon, of the Arab world, Fairuz is looked upon as a symbol of unity, hope and beauty. Her songs greet Beirut first thing in the morning on the radio, her voice wafting through prison bars, restaurants, car windows on busy streets and in the dorm rooms of young college students.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f9NdU8kj7uPwGLgrwTiRreRoVm2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
