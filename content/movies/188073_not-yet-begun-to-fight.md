A retired Marine Colonel reaches out to five men, a new generation returning from the battlefield. He brings them to the river. He puts a fly rod into their hand, teaches them to cast, and shares his secret: there are places where you can still be consumed by a simple act, find joy in a fight, and be redeemed as you gently release another creature, unharmed, into quiet waters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wjUE55kTI9ZacT0EZd4R6oIKoU2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
