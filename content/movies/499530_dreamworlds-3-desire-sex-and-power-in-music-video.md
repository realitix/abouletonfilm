Illustrated with hundreds of up-to-date images, Dreamworlds 3 offers a unique and powerful tool for understanding both the continuing influence of music videos and how pop culture more generally filters the identities of young men and women through a dangerously narrow set of myths about sexuality and gender. In doing so, it inspires viewers to reflect critically on images that they might otherwise take for granted.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Sut Jhally (Himself (Narrator))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
