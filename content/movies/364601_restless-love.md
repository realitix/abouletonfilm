Julia has chosen to remain blind to the obvious signs that her current boyfriend is a two-timing cad, but her eyes are forced wide-open when she discovers that she is pregnant with his child. Diego is a party boy with daddy issues who can\u2019t stay faithful to his sweet, dependable boyfriend. Micaela, meanwhile, is wasting her time chasing a bisexual actress who won\u2019t even acknowledge their shared intimacy in private. As these three charismatic but troubled friends keep spinning their wheels, even their own chosen-family bonds get stress-tested to their breaking point.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7ROrz1wLPiThDksp4PBciVDXZZu.jpg", "actors": ["Maria Laura Nogueira (Julia)", "Renata Gaspar (Micaela)", "Thiago Pethit (Diego)", "Ana Ca\u00f1as (Duda)", "Lucas Brilhante ()", "Sarah Oliveira ()", "Thiago Pinheiro (Marcelo)", "Nara Chaib Mendes (Amiga de Marcelo)", "Felipe Ramos (Amigo de Marcelo)", "Carolina Borelli (Namorada de Marcelo)", "Emannuelle Junqueira ()", "Rodrigo Spina ()", "Bernardo Fonseca Machado ()", "Rodrigo Duarte ()", "L\u00edgia Cortez ()", "Marcelo Lazzaratto ()", "Marco Antonio Seppi ()", "Giovanna Rouvier ()", "Antoniela Canto ()", "Gl\u00f3ria Vellez Dhalia ()", "Nataly Cabanas ()", "Lilian de Lima ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "QKIJg3fOeFM"}
