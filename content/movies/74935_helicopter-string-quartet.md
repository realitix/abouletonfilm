Stockhausen envisioned four helicopters swirling in the clouds, with each of a quartet\u2019s members tucked inside his own chopper, communicating through headsets, stringing away in sync to the rotor-blade motors. He immediately set forth to make that dream a reality. In 1995, Dutch film director Scheffer followed Stockhausen in the days leading up to the premiere performance of his Helicopter String Quartet in Amsterdam. The resulting film offers a rare glimpse of Stockhausen as he patiently dictates every agonizingly detailed measure to the Arditti Quartet.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1MoWZPRl3nvYKWnDhYaNx0WoBj8.jpg", "actors": ["Karlheinz Stockhausen (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
