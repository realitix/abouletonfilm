Almost four years in the making, Maidens picked up local and international short film awards and became compulsory viewing in women and film courses around the country -- where it sparked much impassioned debate. It remains essential viewing for an enhanced understanding of the moment of awakened consciousness that characterised 1970s feminism.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r9yEMC4EcyXid2IyL8MA2wyOFbH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
