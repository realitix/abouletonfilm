The band then took to the road for an extensive tour which included this 1995 live concert in Dusseldorf filmed for Germany\u2019s famous Rockpalast TV series. The set features several tracks from the \u201cStranger In Us All\u201d album alongside classic Rainbow and Deep Purple tracks. The band are on blistering form and Ritchie Blackmore shows just why he is so revered as a guitarist.
