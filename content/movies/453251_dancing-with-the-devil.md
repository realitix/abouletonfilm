Is it freedom of expression or are heavy metal artists dancing with the devil? During the satanic panic era of the late 80's and early 90's, there were record burnings, ridiculous accusations of subliminal messages within songs and lawsuits--all aimed at the supression of rock music. Highlights include the senate hearings with Tipper Gore v. the rock music industry, a man who tried to blow his head off from listening to too much Black Sabbath and best of all, some crackpot preacher who plays 'Another One Bites the Dust' by Queen backwards and shows us what they're really saying--(\"It's fun to smoke marijuana\").", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bKbdMYbox2YAcgqi6i9Q2qYWE7V.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
