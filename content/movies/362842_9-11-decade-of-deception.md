This was known as The Toronto Hearings on 9/11.  Over a period of four days, these experts in Structural Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, and  History gave researched and professional testimony to an international panel of  distinguished judges. The panel of judges, in conjunction with the steering committee would  go on to publish their final analysis of the evidence provided, which called for a new  investigation into the Attacks of September 11th, 2001.  This film is a summary of the strongest evidence given over the four days of hearings. To  see the hearings in their entirety please visit http://torontohearings.org/ or read the  final report available on the aforementioned website.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9ArIumqIKx8Pic3nxOeGKaGI8Pp.jpg", "actors": ["David M.S.
