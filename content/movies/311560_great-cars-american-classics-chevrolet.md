It was great fun watching it with him. This was disc one of a six-DVD series that is dated 2003-2004, and has footage dating from the 50's included. We've rented from our city's library the first two discs so far, and they're around 2 hours each, with four segments each about a half-hour in length. Enjoyable and informative."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
