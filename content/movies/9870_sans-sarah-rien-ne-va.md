After she breaks up with him he vacations at a resort in Hawaii where, unexpectedly, his ex & her rock star beau (Russell Brand) also happen to be staying. Mila Kunis plays a concierge at the resort who takes interest in Peter.  \r\n\r\nThis is a compelling, amusing romantic comedy with Segel likable as the protagonist and Bell winsome and charismatic as his ex. Brand is great as a Jim Morrison-like rock god who doesn\u2019t drink; the way he performs on stage is laugh-out-loud funny (poking fun at rock stars). The resort locations are a highlight and the story is sprinkled with several notable guest stars (Bill Hader, Jack McBrayer, Maria Thayer, Taylor Wily, Paul Rudd, Da'Vone McDonald, Jonah Hill, etc.).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there are several NC-17 (aka porn-ish) scenes that I wasn\u2019t expecting since the version I watched was supposedly rated \u2018R.\u2019 I\u2019m talking about several scenes of simulated sex, including one involving fellatio, as well as full-frontal male nudity right out of the gate (Seriously?). I basically ignored these scenes or rolled with them and laughed. I\u2019m sharing this info for those who don\u2019t care to see a movie mixed with nigh-porn elements.                   \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 51 minutes and was shot in O'ahu, Hawaii, and Los Angeles, as well as studio work done at Universal City, CA. WRITER: Jason Segel.   \r\n\r\nGRADE: B but basically ruined (for me) by the porn aspects, so really \u2018D\u2019"}], "recommandations_id": [16538, 4964, 15373, 32823]}
