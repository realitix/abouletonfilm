But he is destined to learn greater truths: shocked to discover the pain and suffering of so many in his kingdom, he abandons his privileged existence, and his wife Gopa (Seeta Devi), to become a wandering teacher, eventually finding enlightenment and founding Buddhism. Featuring superimposed images and deep-focus shots that were highly impressive for the time, Light of Asia astutely combines a deeply felt spirituality with the surefire attraction of Indian exotica, which helped make it a considerable success in Europe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8mk6yB2cpyWFFP8ClT1m02nLpbT.jpg", "actors": ["Seeta Devi (Gopa)", "Himansu Rai (Gautama)", "Sarada Ukil (King Suddhodhana)", "Rani Bala (Queen Maya)", "Prafulla Roy (Devadatta)", "Modhu Bose ()", "Mrinalini Devi ()", "Sunalini Devi ()", "Sushil Ghosh ()", "Sundar Rajam ()", "Ekambi 'Wilhelm' Tongo ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
