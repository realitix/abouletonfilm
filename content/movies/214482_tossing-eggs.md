At least one child carries a wrapped gift. There are white and black children, and in the distance, two women seem to be the organizers. One enthusiastic young man, his back to us, catches and throws a few. He seems to be playing catch with one of the women at the top of the frame.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
