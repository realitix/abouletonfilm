The two main people in the story are Anna, a young girl (played by Hertha Thiele), who is thought of having the ability to heal people mysteriously. Elisabeth, played by Darathea Wieck, is a young - middle aged aristocratic woman, that is disabled and puts all her hopes in meeting Anna and having her disability heal by her. A strange ambivalent relationship develops between the two women, and just one of them survives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c6EBwoaFSvLTd1wMzsdKbOZLJqE.jpg", "actors": ["Dorothea Wieck (Elisabeth, Gutsherrin von Salis)", "Hertha Thiele (Anna, Bauernm\u00e4dchen)", "Mathias Wieman (Mathias Testa)", "Maria Wanck (Margarete, Elisabeths Schwester)", "Carl Ballhaus (Martin)", "Willy Kaiser-Heyl (Pfarrer)", "Roma Bahn (Mary Lane)", "Dorothea Thiess (Annas Mutter)", "Carl Wery (Annas Vater)", "Karl Platen (Dorfarzt)", "Robert Eckert (Gutsnachbar)", "Margarete Kestra (Helena)", "Doris Thalmer (Nena)", "Sybil Smolova (Schiefhals)", "S.
