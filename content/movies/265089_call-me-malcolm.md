As Malcolm shares his own story and through the stories of others we meet, Call Me Malcolm offers us a glimpse into the real lives of real people who are transgender. But it is only a glimpse. There are many stories to be told and Malcolm helps us make connections to our own stories, encouraging us to share them. That can seem daunting in a culture which has done more to heap shame on persons who identify as transgender. The good news of Malcolm's story is the way in which shame and fear are overcome by grace, compassion and knowledge. Viewers cannot help but come to a deeper understanding of faith, love, and gender identity, and by doing so, arrive at a deeper understanding of their own journey.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dhuhRooxACDCtfKGxhS0meRoZm.jpg", "actors": ["Malcolm Himschoot (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Ss3yRLOTfME"}
