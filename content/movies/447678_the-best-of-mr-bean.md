First unleashed in 1989, the classic British series emerged from Rowan Atkinson's stage performances which featured the silent, physically outrageous comic acting that won him an International Emmy Award, a Cable Ace Award, the Golden Rose of Montreaux--and a global cult following. The madcap brilliance of the awkward man-child puts Bean right on par with greats such as Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. Atkinson's visual humor and infantile havoc-wreaking transcend linguistic frontiers in this irresistible comedy montage. This special collection features the best of the best, with absolutely classic sketches featuring all the funniest, most gut-busting moments in Bean history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rBqEYHCv9DI2Wk3JjsuG4YQSLT4.jpg", "actors": ["Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean)", "Matilda Ziegler (The Girlfriend)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [81555, 545669], "youtube_key": "3aIfMX7FBbI"}
