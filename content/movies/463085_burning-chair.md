As Ishida was creating his first work in his new studio, where the concrete had not yet dried, he threw water on the cool, damp walls of the space, in which he had positioned a chair, and began to shoot. As sunlight shone into the room, the lines created by the trickling water, shaking as if they were at the bottom of the sea, extended and permeated the shadow of the chair, thus evoking an image of fire. The uncontrolled environment\u2014including the speed at which the water dried and the approaching sunset\u2014transformed the studio into a different world viewed through the camera lens. In the finished film, imagination wrestles with creative process, \u2018like playing a sport with unknown rules.'", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
