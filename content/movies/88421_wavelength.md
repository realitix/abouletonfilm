If the film could be said to have a conventional plot, this would presumably refer to the three \u201ccharacter\u201d scenes. Snow\u2019s intent for the film was \u201ca summation of my nervous system, religious inklings and aesthetic ideas,\u201d he said of the 45-minute-long zoom that incorporates in its time frame four human events, including a man\u2019s death. In the first scene two people enter a room, chat briefly, and listen to \u201cStrawberry Fields Forever\u201d on the radio. Later, a man (played by filmmaker Hollis Frampton) enters inexplicably and dies on the floor. And last, the female owner of the apartment is heard and seen on the phone, speaking, with strange calm, about the dead man in her apartment whom she has never seen before.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5Qw2SVlHw5cEOtglfsXvYgEktwd.jpg", "actors": ["Hollis Frampton ()", "Amy Taubin ()", "Lyne Grossman ()", "Naoto Nakazawa ()", "Roswell Rudd ()", "Joyce Wieland ()", "Amy Yadrin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [132161, 150935, 97035, 126132], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
