Following the battle, Darklops Zero was restrained once more by Herodia, remembering a figure named \"Kaiser Belial\" before deactivating. Rei was restrained after his failed attempt to intrude the alien base but was rescued by none other than his alternate self. Unlike the prime Rei, alternate Reimon was never able to control his powers, forced into the state of Reionic Burst until the original Rei punched Reimon, thus deactivating its Reionic Burst mode. Rei revealed that he lost his Rayblood instinct after Hyuga threw Seven's Eye Slugger, creating a scar on his chest which symbolizes the former's friendship with ZAP SPACY members. While searching for Rei, Hyuga instead finds his Neo Battle Nizer and an entrance to the alien base made by Litra. Although the fake Ace was destroyed, Zero try to find an escaped but was halted by Seven and Ultraman impostors.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/idJTHVQOxxXpb3QkJuZDnemH3no.jpg", "actors": ["Shota Minami (Rei / Another Rei / Another Raymon (voice))", "Mamoru Miyano (Ultraman Zero (voice) / Darklops Zero (voice))", "Hiroyuki Konishi (Hyuga / Another Hyuga)", "Mitsutoshi Shund\u014d (Another Kumano)", "Ry\u00fb Manatsu (Ultraman Leo (voice))", "Tomomi Miyashita (Alien Salome \"Helodia\")", "Daisuke Terai (Alien Salome \"Irate\")", "Hiroshi Suenaga (Alien Salome \"Ganaesu\")"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "pfbcThan6Ds"}
