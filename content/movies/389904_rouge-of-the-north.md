A marriage to a wealthy man is arranged for her, and reluctantly she endures it, even though she does not love the man who is as cruel as he is wealthy. His mother is also brutally unkind to her. She then has a son, but her struggles are not over when her husband dies and only leaves her a modest inheritance. Her wretched life has made her bitter, and so she begins making her son suffer as she die; she also becomes addicted to opium.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mR5cCZGgY0EJTaJOAfJHMKsRyUf.jpg", "actors": ["Pat Ha ()", "Hsu Ming ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
