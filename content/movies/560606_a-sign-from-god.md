Laura's increasingly pessimistic attitude she perceives that the cascading negative events of their lives portend a negative \"sign\" about the relationship is offset by Caveh's serene and abiding faith that everything happens for a reason...  Director Greg Watkins is a frequent Caveh Zahedi collaborator. Watkins & Zahedi co-directed A LITTLE STIFF, and Watkins is the cinematographer of Zahedi's I DON'T HATE LAS VEGAS ANYMORE.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2GL4xbY77C7wctGxaSWp5Jn6bW.jpg", "actors": ["Caveh Zahedi (Caveh)", "Laura Macias (Laura)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "5IdlvZ3X170"}
