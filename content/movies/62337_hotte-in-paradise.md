He has three girls on the streets: Rosa is in love with Hotte and is working hard for him. Jenny, the new girl, is an unconventional prostitute but nevertheless much sought-after by her clients. And the third girl, Yvonne, also brings in a large turn-out. So, Hotte\u2019s proceeds are more than sufficient to buy expensive accessoires and to boost his reputation with the other pimps. But when Yvonne quits her job and Jenny starts to work for another pimp, Hotte\u2019s rise comes to a sudden end", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/msg8sh5KPUSHaGY11ospKWRfy2Y.jpg", "actors": ["Mi\u0161el Mati\u010devi\u0107 (Hotte)", "Nadeshda Brennicke (Jenny)", "Birge Schade (Rosa)", "Isabell Gerschke (Elvira)", "Stefanie Stappenbeck (Yvonne)", "Oliver Stritzel (Detta)", "Sven Martinek (Peter)", "Dirk Borchardt (Stulle)", "Mark Zak (Gregor)", "Alexander Schubert (Teddy)", "Anka Sarstedt (Lilo)", "Steffen Jacob (Bon-Bob-Inhaber Steffen)", "Janet Peschel (Jaquline)", "Torsten Buchsteiner (Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer)", "Harald Glitz (Landgastwirt)", "Dietmar Heddram (Zuh\u00e4lter)", "Hans-Ulrich Laux (Lude)", "Andreas Schmidt (Hehler-Hansi)", "Gunnar Treuber (Bernie)", "Alexander Zaiak (Lude)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
