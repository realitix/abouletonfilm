The police are baffled; the town's inhabitants are panic-stricken. A serial killer is on the loose, and as yet more horrific murders take place, the search for clues becomes a desperate race against time. A tense psychological thriller with a chilling climax, this television movie introduced the charismatic, dedicated Welsh detective Noel Bain (Philip Madoc), a man with a passion for defending the innocent and an infallible instinct which the sharpest criminal minds cannot match. Also starring Hywel Bennett as Doctor Lewis, the feature-length drama won a BAFTA Cymru award and initiated the highly acclaimed, darkly authentic crime series which ran between 1997 and 2004.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/25g4P4Dw6ccaJbBpDcu3YkRHYww.jpg", "actors": ["Hywel Bennett (Dr. Gareth D.
