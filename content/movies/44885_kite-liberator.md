During this time, rumors of a new killer have begun to circulate the city. They call her the Angel of Death, an unfeeling assassin who eliminates her targets with grace and precision, leaving only a flurry of feathers as her calling card. What the public is unaware of is the fact that this notorious hitman is a actually a polite young lady named Monaka. Like her spiritual predecessor, Monaka has lost most of her family, and her father's duty as an astronaut keeps hims practically worlds apart. However, they are close despite the physical distances and Orudo promised his daughter that he would return. Until then, daily life for the timid and somewhat clumsy Monaka involves mostly school and her part time job as a waitress, but her nature completely changes once she receives an assignment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3HEMNGjpBvtjtq7PAvr0QFWseh9.jpg", "actors": ["Marina Inoue (Monaka Noguchi)", "Akemi Okamura (Manatsu Mukai)", "Masakazu Morita (Rin Gaga)", "Setsuji Sato (K\u014dichi Doi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [253301, 20032, 45295], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
