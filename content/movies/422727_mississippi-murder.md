Murder Mystery is not one of them, so it was interesting to see this sort of budget have a crack at something different. What was not interesting however, was the movie itself. I'm a big Luke Goss fan, but even I have to admit he was terrible in this. No more terrible than everything else, but still, terrible.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"}], "recommandations_id": []}
