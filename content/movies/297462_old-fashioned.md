There, he has become notorious for his lofty and outdated theories on love and romance. When Amber Hewson, a free-spirited young woman with a restless soul, drifts into the area and rents the apartment above his shop, she finds herself surprisingly drawn to his noble ideas, which are new and intriguing to her. And Clay, though he tries to fight and deny it, simply cannot resist being attracted to her spontaneous and passionate embrace of life. Ultimately, Clay must step out from behind his relational theories, and Amber must overcome her own fears and deep wounds, as the two of them, together, attempt the impossible: an \u201cold-fashioned\u201d courtship in contemporary America.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ufTOEBeGhj4pyJSucb7JNIC2tgB.jpg", "actors": ["Elizabeth Roberts (Amber (as Elizabeth Ann Roberts))", "Rik Swartzwelder (Clay)", "LeJon Woods (David)", "Tyler Hollinger (Brad)", "Dorothy Silver ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [214096, 339079, 259958, 323272], "youtube_key": "sMpEY67fqoQ"}
