Set amid WWII, TREASURE ISLAND follows two American code specialists that are hard at work trying to decipher Japanese messages and sending confusing messages back to deceive the enemy.  The film explores sexual themes that were prevalent during the period, but not shown in the movies of that era.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ln3lfLexixKsktz36tOaVx03RyQ.jpg", "actors": ["Nick Offerman (Samuel)", "Lance Baker (Frank)", "Jonah Blechman (The Body)", "Pat Healy (Clark)", "Suzy Nakamura (Yo-Ji)", "Rachel Singer (Anna)", "Caveh Zahedi (Harold)", "Bob Byington (Thomas)", "Guinevere Turner (Evelyn)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
