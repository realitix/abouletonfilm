Filmed in the midst of battle on the front-line at great risk to the cameraman, this silent film caused a sensation on its release in 1917. Now, in this special documentary, Dan Snow tells the story of that battle, using the newly restored film to cast a fresh light on these dramatic events.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/44ZKULxPwgpHPdYDxIxsiRHfflQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
