In this school, sport far outweighs culture.  However, this does not stop the singers from the group to follow their passion. The principal wants to sabotage the group\u2019s tour and sends one of the school\u2019s teachers to distract the music teacher.  They eventually arrive at a camp where they are treated as if they were in the army. This is all the principal\u2019s doing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/37PFkuB2YpdkNSrGEtF4xosPMa7.jpg", "actors": ["Bobby van Jaarsveld (Mr Stefan Conradie)", "Leah Van Niekerk (Miss Elize Du Bruin)", "Karlien van Jaarsveld (Juliette)", "Bok van Blerk (Sersant-Majoor Fourie)", "Robbie Wessels (Bertie Bredenkamp)", "Hanna Grobler (Cecelia Bredenkamp)", "Katlego Maboe (Duma)", "Rafiq Jajbhay (Vipin Patel)", "Corine du Toit (Miss Van Vogen)", "Dewald Wasserfall (Himself)", "Naas Botha (Himself)", "Juanita Du Plessis (Herself)", "Georic Lomas (Morn\u00e9)", "Franja Du Plessis (Marna)", "Chanell Van Den Bergh (Liesl-Lee)", "San-Mari Nel (Skaai)", "Tiaan Kelderman (Abe Junior)", "Hendri Myburgh (Been)", "Solomon Cupido (Murg)", "Andr\u00e9 Lotter (Military Ape 1)", "Danie Putter (Military Ape 2)", "Marco Spaumer (Military Ape 3)", "Arno Jordaan (Military Ape 4)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "P82fPYKtQJk"}
