To take a break from a series of family disasters, Emil is allowed to spend a few days with a friend of the family, the female priest Hummel in Berlin. In the train he runs across the slick Max Grundeis who anaesthetizes Emil and steals his savings of 1500 DM. When he finally arrives in Berlin, Emil and a gang of street kids, led by the cheeky girl Pony H\u00fctchen, try to find the gangster, who haunts the posh Hotel Adlon as a hotel thief. Meanwhile, to prevent anyone from finding out about Emil's mishap, Gypsi, a member of the gang of kids, passes himself off as Emil, thus wreaking havoc on the home of the priest.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m6HTIhAWxvsggHUPWZjHzg540G4.jpg", "actors": ["Tobias Retzlaff (Emil Tischbein)", "Kai Wiesinger (Knut Tischbein)", "Anja Sommavilla (Pony H\u00fctchen)", "J\u00fcrgen Vogel (Max Grundeis)", "Maria Schrader (Pastorin Hummel)", "Martin Feifel (Paschke)", "Rufus Beck (Hotelportier)", "Rudolf Kowalski (Lehrer Hummel)", "Oscar Ortega S\u00e1nchez (Boban)", "Gruschenka Stevens (Mutter Pony)", "Horst Kotterba (Vater Pony)", "Florian Lukas (Kellner)", "Ludwig Trepte (Sch\u00fcler)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [10519, 11642, 9337, 799], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
