It follows the short life of early Australian aviator, Cliff Carpenter, using his narrative as a template to speak for all lives senselessly lost in wartime conflict. The documentary climaxes in the skies over Oslo, Norway as two Messerschmitt Bf110's attack a RAF Sunderland Flying Boat. Nine airmen perish and one miraculously survives. The story is told through the eyes of Bill Young, the nephew Cliff would never know.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dJ5n1ux7KBua9kPwqkyieR9nszd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
