It was almost immediately after the invention of the motion picture camera that the first pornographic films went into production.  While those early movies slipped through by masquerading as \"art films,\" the increased censorship of the 1920s meant that these raunchy pictures had to be watched behind closed doors - at brothels, gentlemen's clubs, firehouses, and down in basements.  These illegal productions were called stag films, blue movies, or \"smokers.\"  Even the processing of these films had to be kept secret, with many of them developed in bathtubs that once were used to make bootleg \u03a9who had one of these racy shockers in their possession.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
