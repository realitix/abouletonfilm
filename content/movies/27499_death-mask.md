He covers his face because he had a sadistic father who burned his face as a child. Everybody makes jokes about his scars and when the new boss fires him, he goes to an old swamp-witch who gives him a peace of wood from a hanging tree. Wilbur makes a mask from this piece of wood and puts all his anger in this mask. When he puts the mask on, everybody who looks at him commits suicide.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/syXGrj77g3xgB72L044T9XOuEeu.jpg", "actors": ["James Best (Wilbur Johnson)", "Linnea Quigley (Angel Wilson)", "John Nutten (Guido)", "Brigitte Hill (Swamp Lady / Zaranda)", "Diane Cantrell (Dawn)", "Robin Krasny (Louise)", "Cynthia Beckert (Cindy)", "Tom Ferguson (Wilbur Senior / Clown)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [128188, 85157], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
