Jesus is the Good News! [Matthew, Mark, Luke &amp; John] covers the 400 years between the Old Testament and the New Testament before digging in to the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. We walk with Jesus and his closest friends as he delivers the Sermon on the Mount, feeds 5,000, breaks bread at the Last Supper, and gives His life for our sins before God raises Him from the dead. Jesus shows us firsthand what life in the kingdom of God is like \u2013 and invites us all to be a part of it!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5trwqJoa7Z7C85zZ27dnEJBhLEN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
