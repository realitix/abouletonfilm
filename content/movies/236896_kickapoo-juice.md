The always-delectable (except when drawn by the Columbia animators on this cartoon series) Miss Daisy Mae Scragg is heartbroken as she does not share Abner's admiration of the two bachelors--a strictly platonic relationship---who share a cave pad outside the Dogpatch city limits. Neither does Mammy Yokum and she sets out to help Hairless Joe and Lonesome Polecat in a search for a wife, although Hairless Joe and Lonesome Polecat are not aware they are in the matrimony market nor that a search is in progress.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
