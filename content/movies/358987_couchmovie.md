In Stuttgart, the Swabian publisher Annette meets the Polish master in the art of living Pawel, while her niece Nina is expecting a big fiesta in Spain, but meets only a deaf old man. In parallel Matti, a freshly minted high school graduate, hopes to find a great adventure in Paris, while the two Erasmus students Reka and Alma wander through Frankfurt desperately seeking their hosts. In the quest of adventure, diversion or just an authentic travel experience, encountering people whom one never would have met otherwise and so they are confronted not only with counterparts, but also with themselves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wj2M1XQo6H9bRiv6uWRFqOUV0Xu.jpg", "actors": ["Maria Dragus (Reka (segment \"Frankfurt am Main\"))", "Lore Richter (Nina (segment \"Santander\"))", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Kuhn (Cisem (segment \"Paris\"))", "Samuel Schneider (Matti (segment \"Paris\"))", "Babett Arens (Annette (segment \"Stuttgart\"))", "Maxime Beugin (Serge (segment \"Paris\"))", "Ilja Pletner (Pawel (segment \"Stuttgart\"))", "Sarah-Megan Allouch-Mainier (Louise (segment \"Paris\"))", "Helen Woigk (Alma (segment \"Frankfurt am Main\"))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "GjtWONUk1So"}
