As a result, Panizza was imprisoned for obscenity. Schroeter alternates scenes from the Panizza\u2019s work with a dramatization of his trial, presenting the play as an expressionist spectacle performed by actors wearing exaggerated makeup who gesture and grimace grotesquely. The film thus forms a bridge between Schroeter\u2019s use of tableaux in his early experiments with the political urgency of his 1980s films. On the eve of the AIDS crisis, Schroeter is presciently worried about disease as an excuse for governmental repression and the oppression of sexuality. - Harvard Film Archive", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wB6niducgd7gW6tNIlQb4nnooHb.jpg", "actors": ["Magdalena Montezuma (Doppelzeugin)", "Kurt Raab (Gerichtspr\u00e4sident)", "Margit Carstensen (Staatsanw\u00e4ltin)", "Heinrich Giskes (Verteidiger)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
