The rightful owner of the plates, Michael Suzuki, is a multimillionaire who is preparing to open a huge water park in Tokyo. Lupin attempts to enlist the help of his steadfast comrades Jigen and Goemon but find them less than reliable; Jigen is suffering from a toothache that throws off his legendary aim, and Goemon has shamefully had his sword, Zantetsuken, stolen by a woman and given to Suzuki to display in his art collection. The group works on a plan with Fujiko to get both the plates and Zantetsuken.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5CljfpCiCe0uj2isBWtya8F0I5w.jpg", "actors": ["Kanichi Kurita (Arsene Lupin III (voice))", "Makio Inoue (Goemon Ishikawa XIII (voice))", "Kiyoshi Kobayashi (Daisuke Jigen (voice))", "Eiko Masuyama (Fujiko Mine (voice))", "Gor\u014d Naya (Kouichi Zenigata (voice))", "Megumi Hayashibara (Maria Isshiki (voice))", "Kouichi Yamadera (Michael Suzuki (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [80866, 78139, 59719, 52408], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
