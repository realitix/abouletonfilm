This special will feature the world reknown voices of two of Ireland's incredible top actors: with narration by Liam Neeson and also Gabriel Byrne supplying the voice of Patrick.  The story of the real St. Patrick is a fabulous mix of part adventure tale and part spiritual awakening. His radical ideas were suspect and he attracted the censure of the Church establishment in Roman Britain. Patrick refused to compromise this commitment and soon won the respect and love of the Irish and even the finally the reluctant support of his detractors. He started out as a slave an eventually became a liberator, who learned to forgive and ultimately love his enemies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jd4DWTpXuvpMSwJa3yoBpKnj4dl.jpg", "actors": ["Liam Neeson (Narrator)", "Gabriel Byrne (Patrick)", "Se\u00e1n T. \u00d3 Meallaigh (Young Patrick)", "Peadar Cox (Old Patrick)", "Domhnall \u00d3 Loingsigh (Irish King)", "Margaret Linnane (Virgin of Christ)", "John Clancy (King Coroticus)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ap8HFsCeceo"}
