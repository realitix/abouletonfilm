The woman is Harumi, a hairdresser in the deserted town where Kenji has just arrived. It's never really busy in her business. Harumi's husband is a gambling addict and spends all Harumi's money. Maybe that's why Harumi doesn't try very hard to escape when Kenji kidnaps her. His concern about her and his boundless worship probably help, too. Something strange and beautiful blossoms between the kidnapper and his victim, but can this be the basis of a long and happy encounter?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ntbz8pzVCdVIMv6gCE7he5OVBm3.jpg", "actors": ["Kazuki Kitamura (Kenji)", "Keiko Oginome (Harumi Imai)", "Yasufumi Hayashi (Used car dealer)", "Naoto Takenaka (Ikuo)", "Jiro Sato ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
