The film conjures her with a phantasmagoric seance in the suite at the hotel Waldorf Astoria in New York where she lived in the 1950s. Her presence is reproduced by three algorithms: the camera becomes her eyes, a computer reconstructs the prosody of her voice and a robot recreates her handwriting.
