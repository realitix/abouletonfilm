One boy was on a fun spaceship for years and the other boy was kidnapped and molested. These boys were never the same again and they just couldn't re-integrate into the family. I saw these movies when I was little. I've often described them to people, always paired together. They are sort of the comedy and tragedy version of the same story and it is a mundanely spiritual story. Getting Stronger Every Day includes these boys' tales, but they are like mystical objects placed on the living reality of the man storyteller. In other parts of the movie actual mystical objects hover in peoples lives without a myth or story attached. I like to think about how these dimensions interact simply and can be enacted: real life / story / worldly / spirit / video / flat drawing.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rZi7jqpJjkazYEGimlx0KC43Ub.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Greiling (Man)", "Carrie Brownstein (Woman)", "Mia Cianciulli (Girl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "1CEOz_xQADY"}
