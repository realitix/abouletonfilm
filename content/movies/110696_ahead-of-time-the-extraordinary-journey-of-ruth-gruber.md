She defied tradition in an extraordinary career that spanned several decades. The first journalist to enter the Soviet Arctic in 1935, Ruth also traveled to Alaska as a member of the Roosevelt administration in 1942, escorted Holocaust refugees to America in 1944, covered the Nuremberg trials in 1946, and documented the Haganah ship 'Exodus' in 1947. Her relationships with world leaders gave her unique access and insight. This documentary interweaves verite scenes with archival footage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/thov4rXt8p3w3MLQbxBfhIrJE25.jpg", "actors": ["Ruth Gruber (Herself)", "Louisa Herz Leopold (Herself)", "Dava Sobel (Herself)", "Lee Taylor (Herself)", "Harold Ickes (Himself)", "Manya Hartmayer Breuer (Herself)", "Tom Segev (Himself)", "Ike Aronowitz (Himself)", "Mordechai Rossman (Himself)", "Eli Wallach (Mordechai Rossman (voice))", "Therese Plummer (Young Ruth (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
