Both long for the end of the summer, having nothing in common but their love for dogs, notably Adam's precious champion sheepdog Bob. David strikes a friendship with Maggie, the sassy daughter of friendly neighbor Keith Moore, but Adam hates that family on account of an old canine competition-related tragedy. Other neighbors suspect Bob and the Moore's dog of the recent series of nocturnal sheep-kills.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lbm7p2fjM9U2M7YDZhw2C3pNZ3K.jpg", "actors": ["Jemima Rooper (Maggie Moore)", "Colm Meaney (Keith Moore)", "James Cromwell (Adam MacAdam)", "Dylan Provencher (David Roberts)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
