Camaraderie, the first big discoveries of love, enemy gang fights and naive ideas are confronted with the reality of adult's world. The film is about the first contacts with bizarre and absurd reality of relationships and attitudes of adults, politics, emigration, but also betrayal and death and about how all those things form and transform the lives of small boys, who are forced to grow up too quickly.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/izi6g9dJEebnNPkw2QykXPhLCxh.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Labuda (Petr)", "Libu\u0161e \u0160afr\u00e1nkov\u00e1 (Babi\u010dka)", "Milan Lasica (D\u011bda)", "Ond\u0159ej Vetch\u00fd ()", "Alexander B\u00e1rta ()", "Miroslav Noga ()", "R\u00f3bert Roth ()", "Sl\u00e1vka Hal\u010d\u00e1kov\u00e1 ()", "Ond\u0159ej Mal\u00fd ()", "Milan Ondr\u00edk ()", "Lenka Jan\u00edkov\u00e1 (Bastov\u00e1)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
