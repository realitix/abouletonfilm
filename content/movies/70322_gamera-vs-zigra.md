Later, at Sea World, dolphins are dying mysteriously. Zigra kidnaps two men and two children (one of whom is a Coke addict - Coca-Cola that is) and starts causing earthquakes. The two six year olds somehow outwit Zigra and help their incapacitated fathers escape. The Zigra Woman, who can use her eyes to put people into comas, then chases them all over Sea World like an extended Benny Hill skit. Somewhere in this movie Gamera finally shows up, fights Zigra, who turns into a giant swordfish.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2f3L2JAxZVTeHvblG6IIiowApWq.jpg", "actors": ["K\u00f4ji Fujiyama (Dr. Tom Wallace)", "Reiko Kasahara (Kiyoko Ishikawa)", "Isamu Saeki (Dr. Yosuke Ishikawa)", "Yasushi Sakagami (Kenichi Ishikawa)", "Goro Kumon ()", "Daigo Inoue ()", "Daihachi Kita ()", "Shin Minatsu ()", "Akira Natsuki (Doctor)", "Mikiko Tsubouchi (Mrs. Ishikawa)", "Eiko Yanami (Woman X / Chikako Sugawara)", "Yoshio Yoshida ()", "Arlene Zoellner (Margie Wallace)", "Gloria Zoellner (Helen Wallace)", "Keiichi Noda (Jigura (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [52728, 59480, 70358, 22899], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
