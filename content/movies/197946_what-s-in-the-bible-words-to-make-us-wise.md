You'll hear the story of Job and his faithfulness and learn all about the wisdom David and Solomon share in the Psalms and Proverbs. A quick trip through Ecclesiastes will teach you to trust God in the midst of everyday trials, and then Sunday School Lady will explain the \"mushy\" book - Song of Solomon - and how it demonstrates God's love for us. Memorable songs and great entertainment from VeggieTales creator Phil Vischer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8U37POfL1p7PZCqIh10ZysiaJWk.jpg", "actors": ["Phil Vischer (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
