The variety in the characters\u00b4 reactions is made apparent by the way the father, who doesn\u00b4t show his feelings, \"sticks it out.\" While this is happening the viewer is left to deal with this discomfort by him or herself.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
