Scorning the demands of her overbearing family, Bobbie Lee Hartley and Billy Joe McAllister meet at their usual Choctaw Ridge trysting place and attempt to consumate their forbidden love. Using the storied love of Bobbie Lee and Billy Joe as its crucial metaphor, ODE attempts to reconcile modern moralites with a tradition-bound faith, and asks whether it's possible to commit a sin against a religion that won't even have you as a member.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/91wNhocHnFOR9KsibZUVzYNBkFM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
