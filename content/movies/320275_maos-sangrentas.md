The story begins when a gang of dangerous convicts escape from a penal colony. With the police in hot pursuit, the escapees cut a gory swath through the countryside. As his comrades are killed off one by one, the leader of the group descends into gibbering madness. In contrast to this, a subplot develops involving the least dangerous of the escapees, who murdered his wife in a peak of self-righteous rage and is now seriously in doubt about the wisdom of his deed.  Principal scenes reworked in 1962 to make the film The Violent and the Damned (q.v.).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2V3rVQGXYoLE6FwIUxp89tqFciJ.jpg", "actors": ["Arturo de C\u00f3rdova (Adriano)", "Sadi Cabral ()", "Carlos Cotrim ()", "Jackson de Souza ()", "Manuel Pera ()", "T\u00f4nia Carrero ()", "Helo\u00edsa Helena ()", "Lisele Barros ()", "Osvaldo Louzada ()", "Jos\u00e9 Policena ()", "Ramiro Magalhaes ()", "Claudiano Filho ()", "Gilberto Martinho ()", "Aur\u00e9lio Teixeira ()", "Antonia Marzullo ()", "Lidia Matos ()", "Jose Zacarias ()", "M\u00e1rio Costa ()", "Allan Lima ()", "Arnaldo Montel ()", "Milton Marcos ()", "Wilton Franco ()", "Cirilo Dacosta ()", "Paulo Montel ()", "Armando Camargo ()", "Lajar Mar ()", "Edson Vilas Boas ()", "Milton Leal ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
