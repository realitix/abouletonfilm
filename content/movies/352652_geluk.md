The man immediately moves in. The only thing he brings with him - hidden under a cloth - is a large cage. Acting against the man's express warning, the couple goes up to his room when he is away. Their curiosity costs both them and the tenant dearly.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hPUGarJuVg36YLCaaajxArFdDv.jpg", "actors": ["Romijn Conen ()", "Joop Keesmaat ()", "Tjitske Reidinga ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
