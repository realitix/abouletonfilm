On the Norfolk &amp; Western-the last major bastion of steam power in the United States-you'll witness the class Js in passenger service near Cincinnati, Ohio and class K, A, and Y steamers in freight service near Columbus, Ohio, Portsmouth, Virginia, and Bluefield, West Virginia. The mighty class S-1 2-10-2s of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio perform both switching and mainline duty near Willard, Ohio and the durable class T-3s roll along the B&amp;O mainline to Chicago. We even see class EM-1 2-8-8-4 Yellowstones pulling coal drags near Grafton, Ohio. At Columbus, Ohio, on the Pennsylvania Railroad, a wide variety of locomotives are seen in action at the yards and roundhouse. Then we join the chase as a pair of class J-1s doublehead north from Columbus with a long coal drag in tow.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nFQTqH2cJ9vmy9cbe0y4Fd3oVtT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
