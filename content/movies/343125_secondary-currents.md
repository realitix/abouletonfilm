Delivered by an improbable narrator who speaks an extended assortment of nonsense, it is an 'imageless' film in which the shifting relationships between voice-over commentary and subtitled narration constitute a peculiar duet for voice, thought, speech, and sound. A kind of comic opera, the film is a dark metaphor for the order and entropy of language and has been the subject of a number of articles on the use of language in the arts.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xXNwBiUtvYSyeOj1pUuF3nd3RXv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
