Born in Bremen in 1899, the young Hans signs on to the good ship Herbert in 1914, but not before he persuades his mother to buy him a camera. What starts as a hobby soon develops into a passion. Soon Hans is documenting his life on the high seas and his ship's six-month capture during World War I. Later, Hans marries the girl next door, Wilma, but their family life is sporadic because of his seafaring career. Maugg uses a wide palette of cinematic tricks and devices to recall the early years of the century, including sepia tinting, decorative intertitles, distressed footage, and other idioms of early silent documentaries.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yahnNFO6d77Y1hwau5TYUqLkw9S.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
