This is one of a million comedy shorts of the 20s showcasing so-so pratfalls in the middle of Los Angeles, then a very pretty city. The comedy -- involving a collection agency employee who makes up wild excuses to explain his tardiness -- is better when the jokes are on the road, and involve how cars can be smacked into each other, flipped around, and seem to have mischievous minds of their own.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6YQ7qnIuimoRtqNXDrPs4FhEC0p.jpg", "actors": ["Charles King ()", "Constance Darling ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
