We see a master in action in exclusive footage at the various stages off his process--conceptualizing, sketching, and even deciding the color of the stones to be used in the galleries of the Louvre Abu Dhabi. This is a meditative and rare portrait of one of the giants of contemporary architecture and design.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "dYmtbWE8eeQ"}
