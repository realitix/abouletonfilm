Over the course of a 50-year career, Colin Low has directed or produced 200 films, and has garnered a remarkable nine Oscar nominations. During the same period, he has collected images of war--etchings and woodcuts, including extremely detailed miniatures. But the images that have so fascinated and haunted Low are nearly impossible to accurately capture on film.
