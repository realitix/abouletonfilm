Marsh\u2019s portrait of Elvis is constructed from the recollections of friends, relatives and Elvis\u2019s favourite cook, Mary Jenkins, who, with help from Elvis\u2019s father, perfected those infamous fried peanut-butter-and-banana sandwiches. The resulting film traces Elvis\u2019s taste from his humble Mississippi start to his Vegas finale with stops along the way in the school cafeteria and army mess hall. Known for his gustatory excess, Elvis was a picky eater whose success manifested itself in quantity not quality. Marsh\u2019s talent is in full effect in this stylish blend of form and content. Lit like an all-night diner, with a colour palette reminiscent of a sparkly Formica countertop, it\u2019s a perfect backdrop for the King and his southern fried fare.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8yfKlwLtHiHhlUEQOK8H7xhAxLR.jpg", "actors": ["Roy Anderson (Elvis impersonator)", "Rosa Arnold (Herself)", "Martha Babcock ()", "George Christy ()", "Marian Cocke ()", "Joe Stevens (Elvis impersonator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
