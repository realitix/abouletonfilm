But cycling along the beach road is Lauritz, an eleven year old boy en route to treat himself to an ice cream at The World's Smallest Caf\u00e9. Peddles spinning, wheels skidding, he rides his beloved bike through majestic woods and narrow roads to get to the caf\u00e9. Before sunset he will have lost something valuable, but perhaps gained something more precious.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Lauritz Helgesen (Boy)", "Alida M\u00f8rch (Girl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
