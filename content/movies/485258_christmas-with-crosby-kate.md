His seemingly effortless, easygoing singing style and good humor made him an audience favorite for generations. In this rare episode of the Hollywood Palace, first telecast in 1966, der Bingle is joined by dancer Cyd Charisse, comedian Bob Newhart, the Crosby family, and Kate \"God Bless America\" Smith. Bing lends his smooth style to such favorites as the Christmas Waltz, Silver Bells, The twelve days of Christmas, Do you hear what I hear, and of course, White Christmas. Kate Smith belts out Christmas Eve in my home town and there's a special Crosby-Kate medley of catchy Christmas carols.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j7CJoGoL8f3mCRlmLcunL4rABD4.jpg", "actors": ["Bing Crosby (Himself)", "Kate Smith (Herself)", "Bob Newhart (Himself)", "Cyd Charisse (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "S_q6RM8m9UY"}
