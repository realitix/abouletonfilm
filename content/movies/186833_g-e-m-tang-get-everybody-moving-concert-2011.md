These landmark concerts also kicked off her Get Everybody Moving 2011 world tour, which brought her to Australia in August, back in Hong Kong for a second leg in September, Guangzhou and Macau in October, a limited theatrical run in Hong Kong in November, and Canada in December. The pop sensation was in top form and she spared no effort to entertain her audiences, bringing the house down with a string of hit songs and hot dances. Now the unforgettable concert is released on Blu-ray, and it's time you put that live G.E.M. in your collection!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ox7DI1aF9yzfXQjULywUinExqv3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
