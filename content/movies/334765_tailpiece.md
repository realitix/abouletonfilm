It covers the time of finally emptying a long-time family home, with its personal memories and connection with some of my own work. Fragments of verse, along with young children's voices released into the emptying rooms and staircases, and an ersatz 'pop' music track, clarify the familiar and the alien in the situation.\" Margaret Tait", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fZTLZORZJ5lDITaF07ri1Rneimd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
