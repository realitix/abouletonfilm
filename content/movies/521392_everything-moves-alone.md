Scotch spies a creepy yet interesting character stealing luggage, who then offers Scotch a ride into town if he will assist in dropping dirt and a frog-shaped flower pot into another man's car. Scotch, who is clearly several cards short of a full deck, complies and immediately earns the wrath of the car owner McDunley, a bearish sourpuss who runs the local video store and who has a mysterious long-running feud with Anderson, the luggage-thief who quickly becomes Scotch's new best friend.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zvpFf1s9oNU7Oey8aAfKeTYJhbI.jpg", "actors": ["Philip Guerette (Scotch Leary)", "Thomas Edward Seymour (Anderson)", "Matt Ford (McDunley)", "Tina Angelillo (Diane)", "Mike Aransky (Rob Leary)", "Kelly Robinson (Mary)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
