There are also electrics going right back to the 1930s, Underground trains, 1960s AC electrics, feature items and much much more.  Volume Two is 100% in colour and features over 150 separate shots taken by British Transport Films but once again never actually used. The majority consists of magnificent runbys from the \"pre-blue\" era with further classic material from the late 1960s and the early '70s.  This is two whole hours of the very best quality motion pictures ever taken of the BR modernisation period.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/grWVwVVQAo66kZE3QGDmi9okNrq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
