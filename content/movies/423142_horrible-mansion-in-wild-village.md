And a terrifying and mysterious horned creature. And a mute girl locked up in the attic. From this familiar but decent premise, director Lu Shiyu makes his film an endless \u2013 though only 80 minutes long \u2013 series of shrieky nightmare sequences (the main character wakes up with a jolt roughly once every two minutes), ham-fisted flashbacks and trite stalking scenes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j8mB2uc6V5cX5Uz5TVlWC6WOMZa.jpg", "actors": ["Kara Hui (Lu Shiyu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
