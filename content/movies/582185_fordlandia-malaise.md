His aim was to break the British rubber monopoly and produce this material in Brazil for his car production in the United States. Today, the remains of construction testify to the scale of the failure of this neocolonialist endeavor that lasted less than a decade.  Nowadays, Fordlandia is a space suspended between times, between the 20th and 21st centuries, between utopia and dystopia, between visibility and invisibility: architectural buildings of steel, glass, and masonry still remain in use while traces of indigenous life left no marks on the ground.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6iHGOWInDlhOuEMSS59u2RuM4Aj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
