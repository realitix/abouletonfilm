Fans of the more recent Hobo With a Shotgun will love the unapologetic violence and insanity.   \r\nThere are many elements of this short that would benefit a feature length version.  Practical effects are very good and the film is shot well despite the meagre budget.\r\nOverall a short film that seems like it was as much fun to make as it is for the viewer to watch."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
