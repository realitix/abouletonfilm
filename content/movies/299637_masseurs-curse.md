But Fukami is too busy having an affair with a maid and curtly tells Soetsu to ask Sawano, his wife, for the money. As they have no money, Sawano interprets her husband's words as telling her to give herself to Soetsu in lieu of payment. However, Fukami catches them in the act and kills them both. Snatching up Soetsu's money bag with 30 ryo in it, he then asks two ruffians, to sink the bodies in a marsh. From what follows, it seems as if the spirits of Soetsu and Sawano are still hovering on earth in anguish and anger. For soon afterwards, Fukami is found dead by his own hand and Osono, Soetsu's younger daughter, suddenly disappears from home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rRDTI0XqAd608oaJHXqFuQDrDMQ.jpg", "actors": ["Teruo Ishiyama (Shingoro)", "Maya Kitajima (Oshiga)", "Reiko Kasahara (Okuma)", "Ryuko Mizukami (Ohisa)", "Akane Kawasaki (Okyo)", "Natsuko Oka (Osono)", "Takumi Shinjo (Otaki)", "Mitsuko Tanaka (Sawano)", "Kenjiro Ishiyama (Soetsu)", "Saburo Date (Fukami Shinzaemon)", "Chikara Hashimoto ()", "Kazuo Yamamoto ()", "Yukio Horikita (Tomeroku)", "Ikkei Tamaki (Kawachiya Yohei)", "Teruko Omi (Oseki)", "Kanae Kobayashi (Osei, the brothel madam)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
