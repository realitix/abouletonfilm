From the beginnings of the Grand Ole Opry on commercial radio, through the threatening onset of rock 'n' roll in the 1950s, right up to the modern mainstream hits of Music Row, this is the story of how music has shaped Nashville and why today it's a place of pilgrimage for musicians from all over the world.  As well as iconic venues on Lower Broadway and the historic hit factories of 16th Avenue, Bob also explores the East Nashville music scene and discovers a rebellious flipside to the country coin. With exclusive performances from the city's top talent, Bob explains why country music owes its enduring success to Nashville's unique nurturing community of songwriters.  Includes interviews with Emmylou Harris, Duane Eddy, Dave Stewart and Rosanne Cash.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Bob Harris (Himself - Host)", "Emmylou Harris (Herself)", "Duane Eddy (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
