Described as hilarious, complex, stupid, irritating (and 'sardonic' by one lady in Goa) the show veers in and out of the familiar and the bizarre with equal comfort. A knee-slapping head-scratching torrent of jokes, characters and self-aware comedy that successfully spent the entire budget that was available to spend on the show. Featuring six very silly live sketches, stitched together by a much sillier story about the nature of art itself and bookended by extremely silly and unnecessary opening and closing, Sketchy Behaviour is truly a work of something.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qHWrt15TMPerivsFUQg9uK81qto.jpg", "actors": ["Kenneth Sebastian ()", "Kanan Gill ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ls9XRXesXWo"}
