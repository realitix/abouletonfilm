The little they earn goes into drugs and slot machines. She was raised in Los Angeles and he spent his life in gangs, which left him with a bullet wound in the head that sometimes affects his memory. But all the wounds, the drugs and the gambling cannot help them forget that at one time they were a real family with a child they loved tenderly, until the day the Tijuana authorities took her away. Time goes by and Wera\u2019s love for Topo becomes nothing but a bitter memory that accompanies her in her descent to hell.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
