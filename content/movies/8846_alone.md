While she has little problem finding someone for a one night stand, she rebuffs her lovers in such a rude way that they actually don't know what's going on. But what seems to be a negative attitude at first glance is in fact much worse: Maria is suffering from borderline syndrome, a serious psychotic disease that makes her fail to develop a continuous, reliable personality, from her own perspective as well as from the perspective of those she meets. Then one day, she bumps into Jan, a student who falls in love with her without delay. He's awaiting a hard time when he has to learn how hard it is to stay loyal and faithful to a person who, in her own words, \"has a different world inside of her head\" and who feels that \"there is something inside of me that eats me up.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uNo1zG6Y6ZCg6RoblpM3mgOvYlX.jpg", "actors": ["Lavinia Wilson (Maria)", "Maximilian Br\u00fcckner (Jan)", "Richy M\u00fcller (Wolfgang)", "Victoria Mayer (Sarah)", "Tobias van Dieken (Nico)", "Holger Kunkel (Rasmus)", "Peter Fieseler (Yuppie)", "Daniel Drewes (Taxi-Fahrer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [41801, 53049, 84312, 62543], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
