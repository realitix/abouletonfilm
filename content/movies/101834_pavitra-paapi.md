Kedarnath goes out of his way to help a destitute woman, Maya, who husband is missing, with two daughters, Veena and Vidya. Kedarnath rents a room with them, writes letters to her on behalf of her husband, Pannalal, and even arranges the marriage of Veena with the son of Daulatram.

And all along telling Maya that he is a close friend of Pannalal, even though he has never met Pannalal, leave alone know him, making one think as to what devious secret Kedarnath is hiding, and what is the reason behind Pannalal's disappearance.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Balraj Sahni (Panna Lal)", "Tanuja (Veena)", "Parikshat Sahni (Kedarnath)", "Achala Sachdev (Maya)", "Abhi Bhattacharya (Writer (Man who helped Kedarnath))", "Neetu Singh (Vidya)", "Jayshree T.
