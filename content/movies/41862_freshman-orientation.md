Determined to do anything to obtain the girl of his dreams (a gorgeous but reluctant sorority girl), he decides to adopt a gay identity in order to insinuate himself in her life. This casual charade, however, quickly lands him in a morass of campus activism, gender warfare, fraternity hazes, sorority torture, \"coming out\" narratives, political martyrdom, and ultimately, a university-wide meltdown.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/85Jj34KuJieIBobf010KXGNOvt3.jpg", "actors": ["Sam Huntington (Clay Adams)", "Marla Sokoloff (Marjorie)", "Heather Matarazzo (Jessica)", "Kaitlin Doubleday (Amanda)", "Bryce Johnson (Tazwell)", "John Goodman (Rodney)", "Rachel Dratch (Very Drunk Chick)", "Meagen Fay (Mrs. Paul)", "Mark McLachlan (Cullen)", "Mike Erwin (Matt)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [55712, 48288, 31163, 41636], "youtube_key": "BL7lLCFA1K0"}
