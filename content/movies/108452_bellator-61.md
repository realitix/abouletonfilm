Background  The event was to feature the rematch between season-five heavyweight tournament finalists Eric Prindle and Thiago Santos. Prindle and Santos met in the finals of Bellator's season-five heavyweight tourney, but the bout was ruled a no-contest when Santos inexplicably kicked a downed Prindle in the groin. However, on March 15, Bellator announced the fight had been pushed back a week to Bellator 62 due to Prindle having \"flu-like symptoms.\"  This event marked the first time that Bellator Fighting Championships aired in Brazil on TV Esporte Interativo.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lqrrphjtaHCO6TlKCm0vwqOJEBA.jpg", "actors": ["Maiquel Falcao ()", "Norman Paraisy ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
