A train with several passenger cars pulls up to the station. The camera pans, photographing quite a few people and horse-drawn two- and four-wheeled vehicles. The picture ends as a four-wheeled horse-drawn vehicle approaches the camera position. A coachman sits on the box in the front, and in the seat behind him is president Teddy Roosevelt waving at the crowd.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
