Murdered. Her body is found twelve hours later in her own home. Just one of the many sordid domestic crimes hitting the city. Tony Macliesh, her rejected boyfriend, is the obvious prime suspect and he\u2019s just been picked off the Aberdeen train and put straight into custody. But then another woman is sexually abused and throttled to death. And suddenly there appears to be one too many connections between these seemingly unrelated crimes. Detective Inspector Resnick is sure that the two murders are the work of one sadistic killer \u2013 two lonely hearts broken by one maniac. And it\u2019s up to Resnick to put the record straight \u2013 and put the bastard where he belongs", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dPnEzQwhJdPC4T1X6DSavsrkOfd.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Wilkinson (DI Charlie Resnick)", "David Neilson (DS Graham Millington)", "Kate Eaton (DC Lynn Kellogg)", "William Ivory (DC Mark Divine)", "Paul Bazely (DC Dipak Patel)", "Daniel Ryan (DC Kevin Naylor)", "Paul Jesson (Det Chief Supt Jack Skelton)", "Del Henney (DI Reg Cossall)", "Fiona Victory (Rachel Chaplin)", "Michael Feast (Chris Phillips)", "Neil Dudgeon (William Doria)", "John Arthur (Pathologist)", "Shauna Baird (Suzanne Olds)", "Thea Bennett (Elaine)", "Elizabeth Bradley (Vera Barnett)", "Chris Brailsford (DCI Tom Parker)", "Terence Budd (Tony Macleish)", "Bill Cashmore (Michael Taylor)", "Elaine Donnelly (Shirley Peters)", "Steven Elder (Young PC)", "Elizabeth Kelly (Olive Peters)", "Ann Lathlane (Karen Taylor)", "Benjamin Marshall (Luke)", "Gillian Martell (Carole Fawley)", "John McGlynn (John Benedict)", "Celia Montague (Marian Witczak)", "John Hart Dyke (Judge)", "Robyn Moore (Mary Barnett)", "Michael Mulkerrin (Dave Beatty)", "Cecilia Noble (Grace Kelley)", "Jeff Nuttall (James Crumley)", "Tony Osoba (Barrister)", "Lexi Savage (Sarah)", "Graham Seed (DI Michael Grafton)", "Sara Sugarman (Lee Rosow)", "Mandy Travis (Frances Fitzgerald)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
