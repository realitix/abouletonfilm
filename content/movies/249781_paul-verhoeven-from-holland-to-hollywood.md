The programme focuses on talks with Verhoeven, but also includes interviews with many of the people who worked with him, both from the US and Holland, and even his wife. Also has a lot of behind the scenes footage from the set of Showgirls. Verhoeven is very open about the way he works, the themes in his movies and his life. He also interprets his own work in a very frank and intelligent way and, as always, is a gas.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Paul Verhoeven (Himself)", "Monique van de Ven (Herself)", "Rutger Hauer (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
