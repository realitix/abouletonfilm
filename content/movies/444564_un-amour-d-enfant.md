Omar is in love with Yacine, a pretty, intelligent girl from a wealthy family. He decides to pen her a love letter, which ends up causing misunderstanding and a rift between him and his childhood love. Meanwhile, Demba falls in love with a beggar and they share 'secret' stares and tender touches in brief meetings each time. All the children seek advice from their mentor, who sells bicycle-rides at the beach-front. The innocence of childhood infatuation is cleverly layered over a troubled Senegal laboring under the strains of strike action and economic upheaval.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uNvl9rLW1jmZZrC4y300TeHHBh7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
