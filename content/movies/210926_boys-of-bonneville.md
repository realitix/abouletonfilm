More than a century later, many of \"Ab's\" records remain unbroken and the legacy lives on in his custom car. Looking like something Batman would have owned, the story comes full circle when Ab's son Marv, restores the 12-cyclinder, 4800-pound \"Mormon Meteor\" to its glory days for a ceremonial lap on the salt.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c1ZsWnmFYGsJjYwmgvhOVdwnRyy.jpg", "actors": ["Patrick Dempsey (Narrator)", "Jay Leno (Himself)", "Larry H.
