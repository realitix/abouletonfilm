The gardens represent their hobby, their freedom and their living space, which exists side by side with hard work. They cannot however own these \"homes\" and the film shows the chronicle of the events which took place in 1976 - 77 when construction of the Zurich wholesale market hall destroyed 150 gardens and made many people \"homeless\". This portrait of a group is complemented by the stories of three individuals.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kaN0lf0HpNleXFg5WhI39bMaemh.jpg", "actors": ["Franz Sailer (Himself)", "Alex Bruggmann (Himself)", "Trudy Bruggmann (Herself)", "Bruno Giezendanner (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
