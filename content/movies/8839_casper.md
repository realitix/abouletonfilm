Cathy Moriarty plays the venal heir of the mansion and Eric Idle her assistant.\r\n\r\n\u201cCasper\u201d (1995) delivers the goods if you're in the mood for a \"spooktacular\" Goosebumps-like horror film that's fun & silly and not scary at all. It's like Scooby-Doo but without the dog and the teens are tweens. \u201cMonster Night\u201d (2006) and \u201cGhostbusters\u201d (1984) are other reference points, but I prefer \u201cMonster Night,\u201d which has a similar plot, but is all-around more entertaining (even though it cost significantly less) and has a superior assortment of good-lookin' women, young and older. With \u201cCaspar\u201d there\u2019s Moriarty, but she plays the biyatch antagonist. There\u2019s also ricci, but she was only 14 during shooting, although she\u2019s effective in the role.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 40 minutes and was shot at Universals City, California, with establishing shots of Rockport, Maine.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"}], "recommandations_id": [888, 10137, 3050, 9598]}
