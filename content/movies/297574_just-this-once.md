He is simply a spendthrift. Lucy Duncan (Leigh)is a young lawyer fighting for every penny which her working class clients are owed. The trustee hires Lucy to manage Mark's finances, believing that she has the tenacity to get Mark into financial control. It is a battle of titans.\r\n\r\nDuring and after the Great Depression, Warner Brothers produced a number of films which viewed the rich in a negative light.
