Starring Olivier Award winner Michelle Terry as Titania/Hippolyta (described by The Guardian as 'magnificently imperious') and an irresistibly funny Pearce Quigley as Bottom, this touching new production by the Globe's Artistic Director Dominic Dromgoole features 'consistently inventive' staging that 'beautifully captures both the humour and the disconcerting strangeness of the play' (The Daily Telegraph).  Filmed in High Definition and true surround sound.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/co6aZk22kRUL79M30t2Ijgmlnvq.jpg", "actors": ["Michelle Terry (Titania/Hippolyta)", "John Light (Oberon/Theseus)", "Matthew Tennyson (Puck/Philostrate)", "Sarah MacRae (Helena)", "Olivia Ross (Hermia)", "Joshua Silver (Demetrius)", "Luke Thompson (Lysander)", "Pearce Quigley (Bottom)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
