In addition to the interview with the artist himself, a considerable part of the documentary is formed by interviews with personalities such as Ernst Fuchs, Stanislav Grof and Debbie Harry. Though the authors do not avoid particular developmental periods of Giger's work, the main purpose was not to create the artist's biography. In this case, it is more likely considered to be an authentic perspective on the peculiar world of this Swiss surrealist artist.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ldyf4M7NxcLlMxO9xQvXV3OhdT1.jpg", "actors": ["Bijan Aalam ()", "Leslie Barany ()", "Tom Gabriel Fischer ()", "Dana Frank ()", "Ernst Fuchs ()", "H.R.
