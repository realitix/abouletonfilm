The British soldiers were the last of the Great War volunteers, who joined up together to fight the Germans. They knew that there was a strong chance they would die in France, but to die in Dublin would never have crossed their minds. The Irish Volunteers were weekend warriors many of whom had no idea they were about to take part in large scale battles on the streets of Dublin.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Hugh O'Conor ()", "Owen McDonnell ()", "Rick Burn ()", "Karen Ardiff ()", "Megan Cassidy ()", "Gina Costigan ()", "Johnny Eveson ()", "Neill Fleming ()", "Seamus Hughes ()", "Duncan Lacroix ()", "Susie Lambe ()", "Steve McCarten ()", "Malachy McKenna ()", "Sophie Merry ()", "David Moran ()", "Steven Neeson ()", "Cillian O'Donnachadha ()", "Lochlann O'Mear\u00e1in ()", "Sean O'Neil ()", "Dave Sheridan ()", "Dave Sheridan ()", "Mark Tankersley ()", "Dave Sheridan ()", "Noel Whelan ()", "Noel Whelan ()", "Se\u00e1n T. \u00d3 Meallaigh ()", "Colin Farrell ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
