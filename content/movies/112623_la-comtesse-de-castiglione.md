Creepy and beautiful at the same time, it does not share platitudinous ways to frighten the audience with the vast majority of modern horrors. Countess di Castiglione is a really existed Italian courtesan famous for her beauty and wide acquaintanceship among the ruling elite of those times. She directed Pierre-Louis Pierson to help her create 700 different photographs in which she re-created the signature moments of her life for the camera. Robert de Montesquiou, a Symbolist poet, dandy, and avid art collector, was fascinated by the Countess di Castiglione. He spent thirteen years writing a biography, La Divine Comtesse, which appeared in 1913. After her death, he collected 433 of her photographs, all of which entered the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aX7Z9dlPEM2tm3K3p2xWqszYS38.jpg", "actors": ["Virginia Garc\u00eda ()", "Howard Coggins ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
