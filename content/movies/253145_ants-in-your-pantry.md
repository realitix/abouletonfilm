And cycles of the commonest kind: ants harvesting and a baby factory! It also has a voluptuous Queen Ant and a sweetly delivered punchline which may make it worth your trouble. Withheld from television release; presumably because it leaves too many \"birds-and-bees\" questions unanswered for tiny tots (and their beleaguered parents).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eOsKw9cFIVuW7EzmsjNTD8abXF5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "I1UYoV2gZKc"}
