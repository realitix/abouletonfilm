He can\u2019t move anything. He can\u2019t open the cabinet, can\u2019t pick up his bottle of Perrier, can\u2019t open the door. He can\u2019t even feed his fish! Suddenly, a British glam-rock band bursts in the door. The band informs Nick that he is dead and can\u2019t leave. To escape his purgatory of abandoned dreams, he must learn the life lessons he ignored while living. Then, he\u2019ll be judged and sent to either Heaven or hell \u2013 a jarring concept for an atheist like Nick.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2VhEdQV7YxpUmNsEgvyI8YbK0r.jpg", "actors": ["Hayes Hargrove (Nick)", "Matthew Jure (Rex)", "Carey Peters (Beth)", "Timothy Brennen (Nick's Dad)", "Wendi McLendon-Covey (Dawn)", "Sarah Ashley (Sharon)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
