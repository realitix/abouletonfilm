The infomercial is hosted by a young, fast-talking, super-enthused kid who shows all the hilarious ways fartcopter can be used to make your friends laugh. Oh, and also if you switch fartcopter to DRONE mode, it becomes a military-grade killing machine. Kids love that too!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8SyWD3rELFNwl7cDsQ3WPDKiMk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
