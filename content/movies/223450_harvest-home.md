{"tmdb_id": 223450, "title": "Harvest Home", "original_title": "Inagaw Mo Ang Lahat Sa Akin", "slug_title": "harvest-home", "date": "1995-09-13", "genre": ["Drame"], "score": "5.8/10", "synopsis": "In this sonata of primal emotions, an unloved child - ignored by her mother and rejected by her father who prefers instead his other daughter - grows into a woman who manages to manipulate an entire farming community to look up to her as a dutiful wife, a loving daughter and an admirable sister. When the other sibling who chose to be away from home for years even upon her father's demise suddenly returns, dark secrets and skeletons in the closet explode in a single shattering week to tear apart the warped live of an ill-starred family. A powerful film that topples the illusions of bucolic life, it explores a gamut of taboos. It is not only about incest and sibling rivalry but also about pygmalionism, the Electra complex and parricide amidst a sordid agrarian backdrop. Not even the images of bountiful harvest could cloak the ugly reality that lies at the core of the breakdown of one family haunted by the lingering nightmare that could only take place in the fringes of the earth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kBKfYKntwv6iuT1ud83pSUd5hYE.jpg", "actors": ["Maricel Soriano ()", "Snooky Serna ()", "Eric Quizon ()", "Armida Siguion-Reyna ()", "Tirso Cruz III ()", "Robert Arevalo ()", "Jess Evardone (Padre)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
