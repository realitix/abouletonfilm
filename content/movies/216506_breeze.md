Sixty seconds of enchanting associations related to barefooted duchesses and red fairy-tale shoes, cat people and drama queens: an actress, whose moving black-and-white photograph becomes crinkled like drying paper, draws the curtain again, thus escaping the looks of those reaching for and imposing on her, threatening to destroy her with their lust. Withdrawal will be followed by abandonment, self-denial by staging. Cinema, viewed from a distance and yet so close and present: a memo book about the eerie eroticism of overwhelming cinematic possibilities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sFsWYrpgZMV4PTX38quCjsUpUKC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
