This film takes a look at young athletes adept at overriding cruise control to express a completely different philosophy.  The Lillois label COSMONOSTRO signs the soundtrack for these 30 minutes of abandon.  With this final film our tribe takes a final bow and pays hommage to these past years of complicity and adventure.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
