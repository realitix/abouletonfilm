Leonard Lake and Charles NG looked harmless enough when they were caught shoplifting at a store in San Francisco. NG fled the scene, but when the police questioned lake at the precinct, he identified Charles NG as his accomplice and then swallowed two cyanide capsules he had taped to his lapel. The police were stunned by Lake's abrupt suicide. But the .22 caliber pistol and silencer they found in his car indicated far more than a simple shoplifting, and when the registered owner of the car turned up on a list of missing persons, the investigation exploded.
