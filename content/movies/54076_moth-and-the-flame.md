A male moth ignores his lady to chow down on a hat and she's soon seduced by a candle flame, which rapidly spreads. He notices her trapped in a spider web with the fire attacking and makes some attempts to save her, but pours benzene on the fire by mistake. The rest of the moths are summoned, and they fight the fire with water-filled bagpipes, an air drop with a water-filled funnel, etc., while our hero works to free his lady from the spider web.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l15xBO4h4ATA5koDGldJ8kxUWbD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [57222, 67586, 67573, 67585], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
