Although he has attempted acoustic renditions of his past glories, never before has he performed full-band version of his classic early material, but he more than makes up for that with this special show. \"Town Called Malice,\" \"Man In The Cornershop,\" and \"Pretty Green\" from the Jam's collective ouvre are all given an airing, as well as a smattering of Style Council material, and highlight's from Weller's solo career.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lO8h5tRG9AE44SYngrLwtQcWrmz.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Weller ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
