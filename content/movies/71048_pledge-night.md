Way back in the 1960s, someone played a nasty trick on the student Sidney Scheider: He had to take a bath in a tub filled with cornflakes and coffee grounds, vinegar and even more disgusting substances. Nothing unusual so far but someone had replaced the water with pure acid. Sidney was seriously wounded and died a horrible death. This year Acid Sid returns with a vengeance, killing everyone who comes his way. One by one is slaughtered and in the college hell breaks loose.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v8cXRePxRnLRb4LCt7iNGM0NTvU.jpg", "actors": ["Todd Eastland (Larry Bonner)", "Shannon McMahon (Wendy)", "Dennis Sullivan (Bodine)", "Craig Derrick (Cagle)", "David Neal Evans (Richard Goodman)", "James Davies (Zahn)", "Lawton Paseka (J.D.)", "Arthur Lundquist (Dan)", "Will Kempe (Acid Sid)", "Joey Belladonna (Young Sid)", "Cecelia Wilde (Connie)", "Suzanne Dean (Sandy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [78073, 68884, 101720, 28867], "youtube_key": "hnDiL4Nq8Ak"}
