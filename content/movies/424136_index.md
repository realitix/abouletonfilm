A hot- headed student protests the Dean's decision to expell a fellow student on fake accusation charges, upon which he drops out of university rather than make a compromise. He loses everything in the process: his girlfriend, housing privileges - he becomes a coal deliverer. On the job he witnesses an accident that causes death of a fellow worker. He decides to write a story, which is good and a publishing house wants to print it, but only after some corrections are made. He refuses again and the story is not printed. Finally, a story is commercialized and made into a succesful film and brings fame to the original author.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/su6oUKT6MQb6NPPmUwAki3KjLSy.jpg", "actors": ["Ewa Barszczewska ()", "Milosz Benedyktowicz ()", "Tadeusz Bogucki ()", "Jerzy Duszy\u0144ski ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
