They\u2019re rescued from the wreckage by Freddy (Robert Longstreet), a divorced oil worker whose stoic facade crumbles as he comes to see himself, and his repressed desires, in Maya. As Jules recovers, Maya and Freddy develop a rapport that dulls the debilitating silence of their small-town lives. Together, they subtly encourage one another to chase after what they want the most (or at least figure out what that might be).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6wyu5Vs5aLF3FTjdryzWC5YRPhE.jpg", "actors": ["Tallie Medel (Maya)", "Robert Longstreet (Freddy)", "Betsy Holt (Jules)", "Jonathan Miles Howard (David)", "Liz Cardenas Franke (Andrea)", "Rafael Villegas (Luis)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
