But now his last day as a master at the plant has come. He is about to retire; even if Karl, who finds ending his working life difficult, wanted to stay on, it would not be possible. Karl\u2019s colleagues have arranged a farewell dinner for the retiring master at an outdoor restaurant. But on his last day of work, before the farewell dinner, he meets all sorts of people: both colleagues and people, who do not work at the plant. A mosaic of the biography of a person who found fulfilment in his work and now has to look for the meaning of his life anew.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/midysNiTyoRMJtrPycEgALZniMw.jpg", "actors": ["Erwin Geschonneck (Achilles)", "Jutta Wachowiak (Ursel)", "Fred Delmare (Kanarienvogel)", "Wolfgang Winkler (Baumann)", "Hermann Beyer (Dr. Huhn)", "Elsa Grube-Deister (Marga)", "Gert G\u00fctschow (Walura)", "Ute Lubosch (Beate)", "Carl Heinz Choynski (Bahre)", "Dieter Franke (Herr B\u00e4uerlein)", "Christa L\u00f6ser (Frau R\u00f6der)", "Horst Lebinsky ()", "Fred-Artur Geppert ()", "Erich Petraschk ()", "Carmen-Maja Antoni ()", "Gudrun Ritter (Frau B\u00e4uerlein)", "G\u00fcnter R\u00fcger ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
