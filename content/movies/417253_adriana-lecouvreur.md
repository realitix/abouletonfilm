Opposite her, in the role of Adriana, is a soprano who as a Verdi and verismo specialist also appears regularly at all the major international opera houses, Micaela Carosi. The 'cock-of-the-walk' role is sung by the world-class tenor Marcelo \u00c1lvarez. His timbre, velvety smooth yet robustly virile, is ideally suited to a vocal characterisation of the idolised Maurizio. Conductor Renato Palumbo is very much at home with Cilea's operatic masterpiece, since the Italian Romantic and verismo periods are at the core of his extensive repertoire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/arvpRtQMDeAwJvvFwXwIFPbl0DN.jpg", "actors": ["Micaela Carosi (Adriana Lecouvreur)", "Marcelo \u00c1lvarez (Maurizio)", "Marianne Cornetti (Princesse de Bouillon)", "Simone del Savio (Prince de Bouillon)", "Luca Casalin (Abb\u00e9 de Chazeuil)", "Alfonso Antoniozzi (Michonnet)", "Antonella de Chiara (Mlle.
