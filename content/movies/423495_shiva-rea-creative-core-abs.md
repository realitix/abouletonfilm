Now, one of the yoga world\u2019s top female teachers shows you an enlightened way to a powerful core. Unlike repetitive conventional abs work, Shiva\u2019s fluid yoga-based approach awakens your creativity and inner fire, building strength and grace in the same way that surfing, rock climbing, or dancing does\u2014while you\u2019re enjoying yourself, not counting the minutes until it\u2019s over. The program includes three flowing segments, which can be done all at once or individually.  Filmed at White Sands National Park, the program was directed by James Wvinner and shot in HD by Hollywood\u2019s Sion Michel (Memoirs of a Geisha). Beautiful, effective, inspiring. It\u2019s an abs workout you\u2019ll look forward to doing again and again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oia4APfFswEODvGTigVbqFDwEHr.jpg", "actors": ["Shiva Rea ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
