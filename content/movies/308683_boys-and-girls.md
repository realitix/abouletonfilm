The experience is not obvious and the ten tenants have to cope with more than one difficulty. But they also have their moments. Things really go awry when Fran\u00e7oise, an unmarried girl, is forced to deliver the baby she carries prematurely and when Solange, the lonely girl of the group, attempts suicide. Shortly afterwards, the group learns that the house is due for demolition. They decide to take advantage of this opportunity to face adult life individually.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pgO8qY899YohfJJIIzBM5UD98dS.jpg", "actors": ["Fran\u00e7ois Leccia (Guy)", "Nicole Garcia (Coco)", "Fran\u00e7ois Duval (Jean)", "Jean Maucorps (Henri)", "Martine Kelly ()", "Marc Porel ()", "Ludmila Mika\u00ebl ()", "Roger Van Hool ()", "B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Lacoste ()", "David McNeil ()", "Max Amyl ()", "Jocelyne Bressy ()", "Rosine Cadoret ()", "Martine de Breteuil ()", "Elisabeth Depardieu ()", "Les Dustbins ()", "Jean-Pierre Honor\u00e9 ()", "Jean Michel Jarre ()", "Mary Marquet ()", "Christian Melsen ()", "Jacques Portet ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
