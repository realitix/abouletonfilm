With the help of Egodoki, Frau PC has the Ludovico Technique applied on him, and beside the broken Alex she has Rex Madison, the protagonist of American Psycho brought in, with handcuffs on. The self-assured gigolo breaks down at the appearance of Maggie, his first love, and it is he who wins the confessional show led by Mrs Cardinal Paula Aquarius, which incurs pardon to be given. Rex, freed from his shackles, shoots the majority of those present, rapes PC and leaves together with Alex by helicopter. The show continues on the moon.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eZlHnAc34fHIKkJuQ748lK1JJlk.jpg", "actors": ["Dorottya Udvaros (Frau Plastic Chicken)", "Zolt\u00e1n Mucsi (Little Alex)", "Viktor Bod\u00f3 (Rex Madison)", "Gergely B\u00e1nki (Sony Double Junior)", "S\u00e1ndor Terhes (Homeless man / Ego Doctor)", "S\u00e1ndor Cs\u00e1nyi (Balf\u00e9k / T.
