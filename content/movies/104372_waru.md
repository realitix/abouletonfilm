Hisao Maki who is\r\na real Karate expert loves to write himself into his adaptations. Here\r\nhe serves as the original creator of the '70s manga as well as the\r\nscreenwriter. Waru in particular seem very disjointed with scenes\r\nbarely held together with the thinnest of plots. No one including\r\nTakashi Miike, Sho Aikawa and Hisao Maki seem to be trying very hard."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
