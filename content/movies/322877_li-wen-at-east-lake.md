You can get worked up about it and get involved - or you can think, it won\u2019t affect me. Fortunately there\u2019s the intriguing new film by Li Luo, which brings to an end these doubts.  East Lake (Dong Hu) is a scenic area in the city of Wuhan, threatened by new amusement parks, high-rises and even an airport. \u2018East Lake is getting smaller and smaller, but it's bigger and bigger in my memory,\u2019 wrote a friend to the Canada-based Chinese filmmaker Li Luo as a result of the development. In a lucid way, the film investigates how the lake is linked to the people, leading to reflection on identity and survival in today\u2019s China. The form is varied and free. Li uses documentary as well as fictional style elements, and often an ironic mixture of both.  \u00a9 iffr.com", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bcMNthcfpb1xTm8pVvqGT2NjLHb.jpg", "actors": ["Li Wen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
