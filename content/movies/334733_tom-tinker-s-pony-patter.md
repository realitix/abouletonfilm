Cuts to two ponies on a seesaw, with a moustached man in a white uniform with dark piping and a white cap holding their leads. A second trainer in a dark suit can also be seen occasionally with the ponies. Individual ponies perform a variety of tricks, including rolling a slatted barrel across the stage with front legs and then with a nose, knocking over the barrel, \"limping\" across the stage with one front leg held off the ground, and pushing the trainer over with a nose-butt.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ypE8L1iVY81d1aHzSIa0yRRFhuL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
