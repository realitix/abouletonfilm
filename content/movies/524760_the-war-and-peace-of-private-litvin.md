Despite his age, he appreciates life in all its manifestations, dreams of yet another parachute jump and spends years telling his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren about the war. This is the story of a typical Russian family and the common attempt of its several generations to understand how much the shock of war matters to them and... does it matter at all?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sQd9U2fYmXorWmUQh3qBlKlf17A.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "p-lkFWJkDIs"}
