He spent the next 33 years in prison for the \"crimes\" of peaceful demonstration and refusal to denounce his apolitical teacher as an Indian spy. He was tortured, starved and sentenced to hard labor. He watched his nation and culture destroyed, his teachers, friends and family displaced, jailed or killed under Chinese occupation.  Fire Under the Snow reaches back to Palden's birth in 1933 and follows him through the Orwellian nightmare that began with the Chinese invasion. We cut back and forth between the past and Palden's present as an activist, living in exile. Our P.O.V. becomes a \"third eye\" hovering over Palden\u2019s current life, haunted by his memories of the past. We explore the escalating cycle of interrogation and physical violation during his years in prison that ended decades later with Palden's escape from Tibet and a cathartic meeting with His Holiness the Dalai Lama.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/meX89fx8oBjRiypvBKkIoqnMGet.jpg", "actors": ["Palden Gyatso (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "zcpg4yX22K0"}
