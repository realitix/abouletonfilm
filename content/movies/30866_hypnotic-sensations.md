R. Bolla is the therapist, a man whose cures rely pretty heavily on Ginger's jiggly allure. His first client is a man who can't seem to become sexually aroused - but once the doctor unleashes Ginger on him, you can bet that his spirits start to rise. Christy Canyon also shines, sharing her awe-inspiring natural assets with Bolla and Ginger in a pair of feverish flings. The finale finds Bolla and Ginger all out of new clients. Without clients to arouse, they turn their amorous attentions on one another in a slam-bang session that closes out the film on a heated high note. A fantastic 80s-style romp!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ejP0MjkbIIg6SWRvvrkfT4ku8uR.jpg", "actors": ["Ginger Lynn Allen (Heather Cummings)", "Christy Canyon (Jeanie)", "Rikki Blake (Trudy)", "Robert Kerman (Dr. Sheckle)", "Rick Cassidy (Frank)", "Jessica Wylde (Lisa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
