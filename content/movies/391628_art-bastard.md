Is its value determined by its popularity or originality? Is the goal profit or expressing one's personal vision? These are some of the questions raised as we follow fiercely independent New York artist Robert Cenedella in his artistic journey through decades of struggling for creative expression.

In portraying Cenedella's determination to buck the system of what's popular while critiquing that popularity in his attempt to turn the art world upside down, ART BASTARD is a funny, touching, and insightful look inside the maverick mind of a true original.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x6S9EWGKhdAmKiD1vSgGfuZZfhL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "eXhy5prz83k"}
