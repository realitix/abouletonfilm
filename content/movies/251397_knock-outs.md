To scare up some quick cash, she and her sisters decide to pose for a bikini calendar. Unfortunately, they end up exploited when sneaky photographers rig their dressing room and film them in the nude. It was a rotten trick and now the girls are really angry. They are so angry that they learn martial arts and then challenge their leather-clad hog-riding rivals to a no-holds-barred wrestling match. They then get revenge upon the photographers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b30qJgMJjUo94CY9SbFgZt3eXoc.jpg", "actors": ["Brad Zutaut (Whitney)", "Robert Rhine (Earl)", "Bill McGovern (Garth)", "Tally Chanel (Samantha Peters)", "Leigh Betchley (Brooke)", "Cindy Rome (Vicki)", "Nicole Sassaman (Hallie Davidson)", "Chona Jason (Ninja)", "Michelle Grassnick (Margo)", "Paula Revee (Candy)", "De'Ann Power (Julie)", "Pamela Ward ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
