Joe is a talented rodeo-rider, which fascinates the little girl Susanne and gives her the wish to have him as a father. Her mother Maria, however, is to marry the evil, rich farmer Dave. Susanne wants to stop the wedding, so she sneaks aboard Joe and Benny's wagon to persuade them to intervene. Dave brands them as kidnappers, forcing them to flee as outlaws to one of the families tyrannized by Dave. Together, they strike back at Dave, at which point Maria sees that he's the wrong man for her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d9XWX4TNkxM1NhaeJwt94mzg0Oy.jpg", "actors": ["Dean Reed (Joe)", "V\u00e1clav Neck\u00e1\u0159 (Beny)", "Kerstin Beyer (Susann)", "Violeta Andrei (Maria)", "Iurie Darie (Dave Arnold)", "Stefan Diestelmann (Barkeeper)", "Helena R\u016f\u017ei\u010dkov\u00e1 ()", "Ji\u0159\u00ed R\u016f\u017ei\u010dka ()", "Siegfried Seibt ()", "Elke Gierth (Silvia)", "Ion Dorutiu ()", "Gertraud Last ()", "Vlad Radescu ()", "Cristian \u0218ofron ()", "Mihai Mereu\u0163\u0103 ()", "Dan Dobre ()", "Miron Murea ()", "Theresia Wider ()", "Bodo Schmidt ()", "Elena Sereda ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
