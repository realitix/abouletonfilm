Clara, a forty year old 'tai tai' (wealthy lady of leisure) faces a mid life crisis and decides to runaway to the only place that has ever made any sense to her - the shopping centres. As she lives there, Clara crosses paths with other 'creatures' of the mall, namely Renu, an eight-year old latchkey kid who has been abandoned by her parents in a 24 hour mall and Aaron, an angst-y twenty three year old who skives work to hang out at the mall with his friends. Together, these characters lead audiences through a journey of love, loss and liberation through the heart of Singapore where they find that their dreams can be bought and broken.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/khBttQu62x1RO55KiQI4LweL4m3.jpg", "actors": ["Kym Ng (Clara Wong)", "Adrian Pang (Valentine Tan)", "Aaron Kao (Aaron Ho)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
