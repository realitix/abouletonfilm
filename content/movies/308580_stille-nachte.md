But every Christmas they become a couple again. Then they play Georg's parents, Clara and Paul, the happy spouses because Georg just does not dare to tell them the truth. Rita in turn pretends to be in a new relationship, although in truth he is still attached to her. Even his job as a senior physician, the good-natured nurse has just come up with. But Rita also conceals her worries. The two do not suspect that Clara and Paul have already seen through the masquerade of the two and play their own little game.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/69xdkoyNmU6AhftI2Gbo6zfJ1mr.jpg", "actors": ["Matthias Koeberlin (Georg)", "Katharina Sch\u00fcttler (Rita)", "Katharina Thalbach (Clara)", "Hanns Zischler (Paul)", "Kai Ivo Baulitz (Dr. Hans Marek)", "Nadine Wrietz (Manuela)", "Erich Krieg (Bestatter Merger)", "Gamze Aktas (Yvonne)", "Monika Barth (Frau Kiesling)", "Clara Brauer (Nina)", "Klaus Dittmann (Herr Sommer)", "Nele Hollinderb\u00e4umer (Jenny)", "Sonja Hurani (Filiz)", "Markus John (Bernie)", "Petra Kalkutschke (Amts\u00e4rztin Dr. M\u00fcller)", "Guido A.
