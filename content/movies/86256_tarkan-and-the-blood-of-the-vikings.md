Everything in this movie is energetic, outsized, colorful and wacky, from Tarkan\u2019s mighty moustache to the Vikings\u2019 red and blue fuzzy underoos. Tarkan doesn\u2019t just walk around, like Hercules - he runs, he leaps, he literally bounces from place to place. The gigantic melees capture the frenetic flavor of old Errol Flynn movies, but up the ante of sex and violence to please \u201870s moviegoers. It\u2019s like Conan the Barbarian done on $10,000 and amphetamines. - CSB", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zI8hKKMr3ZAdHqLANYHPV6DnXs1.jpg", "actors": ["Kartal Tibet (Tarkan)", "Eva Bender (Ursula)", "Seher Seniz (Lotus)", "Fatma Belgen (Yonca, daughter of Attila)", "Bilal Inci (Tora)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [71057, 81931, 109558], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
