The film is constructed around the video 'correspondence' between two branches of a family, one living in Germany and pursuing 'modern' life and the other one living in a little village in Yugoslavia clinging to tradition. Through the home video 'letters' sent back and forth, petty jealousies, love liaisons and financial squabbles drive the family to the brink of war, a situation that reflects the collapsing state of affairs in what was then Yugoslavia.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qkZhIDthWqADs9Nty35NR9e11xi.jpg", "actors": ["Danilo 'Bata' Stojkovi\u0107 (Milovan)", "Aleksandar Ber\u010dek (Radovan)", "Mira Furlan (Jovanka)", "Zoran Vrba\u0161ki (Jovan)", "Radmila Savi\u0107evi\u0107 (Baba Milica)", "\u017darko Mitrovi\u0107 (Deda Jovan)", "Olivera Markovi\u0107 (Radmila)", "Karin Neuh\u00e4user (Kurty)", "Bo\u0161ko Milosavljevi\u0107 (Johann)", "Dragan Bjelogrli\u0107 (Milisav)", "Josef Ostendorf (Grof von Wurnek)", "Branko \u0110uri\u0107 (Postar Sima)", "Olja Be\u0107kovi\u0107 ()", "Ranko Kova\u010devi\u0107 (Pokojnik)", "Neboj\u0161a Bako\u010devi\u0107 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "w1oic-oTVOc"}
