He's also the brilliantly odd creation of Gregg Turkington, a decidedly more gifted comedian who has found a loyal cult following for his Tony Clifton-esque character. In this concert release, Hamburger performs a handful of twangy country tunes alongside the Too-Good-For-Neil-Hamburger Band, a name that speaks the truth: the back-up group includes veteran rockers Prairie Prince, David Gleason, and Atom Ellis.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m99SDv6bZl707YtLAtOKMdCio2P.jpg", "actors": ["Gregg Turkington (Neil Hamburger)", "Atom Ellis (Himself)", "Dave Gleason (Himself)", "Barry Hansen (Dr. Demento)", "Prairie Prince (Himself)", "Simone Turkington (Card Girl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
