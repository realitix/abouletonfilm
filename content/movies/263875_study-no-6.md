It was only with the introduction of sound, beginning with Study No 6 that the films did full justice to this musical principle. The play of the white lines, the arcs, and the upside-down U\u2019s running hither and thither like ballet dancers was brought into perfect synchronization with the music, and thus the films offered an abstract illustration of the melodies. Study No 6 is certainly the best of his films in terms of forms. - Hans Scheugl and Ernst Schmidt, Jr.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/95qWJf2RjiPWcKNhYk5onTiFGS8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [187879, 163890, 193919, 186164], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
