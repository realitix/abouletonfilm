In the university, several interests groups or clubs are commonplace. Against the Heavy Weights Club, another club Silver Lines Movement is born.  SLM vows to oppose all antisocial, antidemocratic tendencies including economic exploitation on campus.

It also exposes the special interests of godfathers from inside and outside campus.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/enxYGj5zkHSZilMaRF2d5eN6nMQ.jpg", "actors": ["Segun Adefila ()", "Lanre Fasasi ()", "Tope Idowu ()", "Khabirat Kafidipe ()", "Serah Mbaka ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
