Join one of Fosse's most gifted collaborators, Ann Reinking, as she and a wild, gyrating cast take you through such memorable standards as \"Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries,\" \"Steam Heat,\" \"Mein Herr,\" and the unforgettable \"Big Spender.\" and more!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o2xhuuZbOGPGlUAJ0kCJwNPs56w.jpg", "actors": ["Ann Reinking ()", "Ben Vereen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
