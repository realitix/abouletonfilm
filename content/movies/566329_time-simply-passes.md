The victims were all children in the same family of African-American citrus pickers. Their father James Richardson was convicted of the crime and sentenced to death. More than 20 years and a series of unprecedented miracles followed in order to set him free. Now, in the present day, James Richardson travels back to Florida in the hopes of receiving a glimmer of justice from a State which took his life away.
