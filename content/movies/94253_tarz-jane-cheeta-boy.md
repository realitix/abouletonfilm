So Tarzan, his ditsy, oversexed distaff companion Jane (an endearingly daffy Tallie Cochrane, Wright's real-life wife), and their lunkhead son Boy (some vacuous California surfer dude type who calls himself Uncle Tom) embark on a perilous pilgrimage to Wango Wango Land in order to get Tarzan another penis.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gNccDN6SndpvmwRsPBhITdA2wx.jpg", "actors": ["Tallie Cochrane (Jane)", "Patrick Wright (Tarz)", "Georgina Spelvin (Wanda - The Huntress)", "Uncle Tom (Boy)", "Five Fingers Eddie (Clive)", "San Clemente Richard (Cheeta)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
