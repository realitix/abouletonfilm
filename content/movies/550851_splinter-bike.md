Inspired when the 2010 Tour of Britain passed by Tommo's workshop in the heart of the Norfolk Broads, this documentary follows the trials and tribulations of the duo over a 12 month period, from design, prototyping and testing, being the centre of a global media storm, the record attempt itself, through to the installation of their unique creation at The Victoria & Albert museum in London.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6GagUzwAr3YK9T4TaxWcXYpU8T1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
