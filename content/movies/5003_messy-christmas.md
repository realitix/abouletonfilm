Sara is happily married to Jan, though this wasn't always the case -- Sara is Jan's second wife, while Sara has three ex-husbands, Gunnar, Andi and Erich, and she and Jan are raising children from each of their previous marriages. Jan is less than thrilled with the prospect of spending the holidays with Sara's mother, but things get worse when he learns his wife has planned a surprise for Christmas eve -- they'll be joined by Gunnar, Andi and Erich, as well as Erich's new wife Pauline, Andi's current spouse Rita and his own ex-wife, Eva. To call the atmosphere uncomfortable is an understatement, and things only get worse when Sara announces she's pregnant, which is quite troubling for Jan since he's been waiting for the right time to tell her he had a vasectomy several months before.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3RFTmQpP0ow5xsLW5kzTuJctrVI.jpg", "actors": ["Martina Gedeck (Sara)", "Heino Ferch (Jan)", "Jasmin Tabatabai (Rita)", "Meret Becker (Pauline)", "Rainer Sellien (Erich)", "Roeland Wiesnekker (Andi)", "Rosa Enskat (Eva)", "Andreas Windhuis (Gunnar)", "Matthias Matschke (Thomas)", "Ursula Doll (Anne)", "Alexandra Neldel (Isabell)", "Petra Kelling (Inge)", "Feo Aladag (Helena)", "Bjarne M\u00e4del (Max)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
