With the aid of drawings to illustrate their psychological probing, the ladies perform basic physical repetitions and frozen poses while being captured on video and re-lensed through low-fi cyan solariziations. Layered stereo monologues speak of their continuing personal explorations into the science-fiction dream-symbol terrain of their private histories.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3Ez3gn5nVXyCO1kpQh547XzcNmE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
