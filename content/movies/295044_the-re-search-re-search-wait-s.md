As a picture of modern consumer society literalized to an extreme, Re\u2019Search Wait\u2019S verges on social science-fiction; and by examplizing Any Ever\u2019s other half into fuel for their own stories, these works tie the seven together as a yin and yang of nihilism and boundless meaning.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6kG54tmnvhyNr8ceXz9xvBCSgok.jpg", "actors": ["Lizzie Fitch ()", "Ryan Trecartin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
