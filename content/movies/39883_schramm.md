He works as a taxi driver and lives by himself where he is happy to answer his door to strangers and kill them outright. As with many shy loner types he has a problem dealing with woman so he drugs them and photographs their nude bodies for sexual stimulation. He then murders his helpless victims and so goes the life of a deranged serial killer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bsQa2eBbGUsavxIS5zmICMUWRow.jpg", "actors": ["Florian Koerner von Gustorf (Lothar Schramm)", "Monika M.
