After years in a loving home, Jon, a toy, was forgotten, deserted and ultimately betrayed by his adoptive mother. He returns to live a sad life as a worker on the line; a life of factory work and oppression in a place where hundreds of cabbage babies are born every day. The thankless task of shucking, picking, and processing these newborns to go out into the world and to their new mothers has taken its toll on Jon. With each new birth, Jon slips deeper into sadness, lamenting the days when life was good and he was loved.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/UZQiLlZsU47yC64iEwIwdEHjGN.jpg", "actors": ["Rob Ramsay ()", "Zoie Palmer ()", "Julian Richings ()", "Suresh John ()", "Ken Hall ()", "Jake Michaels (Max)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [133535, 309000, 202244, 27826], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
