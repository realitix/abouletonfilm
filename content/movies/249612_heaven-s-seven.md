They successfully seize the trucks, only to find that there's nothing precious within. A troop of fully-armed, brutal, not to mention racist GIs, led by Peter, is now after them. At the same time, their former superior (in charge of seven) is tracking down a cargo of dangerous chemicals and he asks for their help. They reluctantly agree, and their personal conflict is turned into an action-packed confrontation fought and waged for the sake of one thing only: their country.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nu0loExfa7G35DaBrGl5kG36Xwm.jpg", "actors": ["Pongpat Wachirabunjong (Sgt.
