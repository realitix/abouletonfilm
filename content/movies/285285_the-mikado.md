He lights upon Nanki-Poo, a strolling minstrel who loves the beautiful Yum-Yum. But Yum-Yum is also loved by Ko-Ko, and Nanki-Poo, seeing no hope for his love, considers suicide. Ko-Ko offers to solve both their problems by executing Nanki-Poo, and an agreement is reached whereby Ko-Ko will allow Nanki-Poo to marry Yum-Yum for one month, at the end of which Nanki-Poo will be executed, in time for the arrival of the Mikado. But what Ko-Ko doesn't know is that Nanki-Poo is the son of the Mikado and has run away to avoid a betrothal to an old harridan named Katisha. The arrival of the Mikado brings all the threads of the tale together.  This is the Stratford Festival of Canada, directed by Brian Macdonald. This is a filmed version of a stage performance, and the sets are beautifully spare and economical.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hm7LMIm16cKUUMiFI3BadsAQeg7.jpg", "actors": ["Gidon Saks (The Mikado of Japan)", "Henry Ingram (Nanki Poo)", "Eric Donkin (Ko Ko)", "Richard McMillan (Pooh Bah)", "Allen Stewart-Coates (Pish Tush)", "Marie Baron (Yum Yum)", "Karen Wood (Pitti Sing)", "Karen Skidmore (Peep Bo)", "Christina James (Katisha)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
