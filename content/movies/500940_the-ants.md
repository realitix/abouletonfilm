She tries to establish a rhythm through every day routines such as eating, sleeping and washing. We see one of here childhood memories-an Alsatian dog licks a girl's heel and rests its head between her legs- and a dream, in which she is standing naked I a pit which could be a grave. In addition we see a magnified symbolic version of her surroundings, particularly of insects. Shots of windows, doors and mirrors convey a sense of menace and introspection. Thanks to measured performance by Marion van Wijk, superb lighting, black and white photography and well balanced editing.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
