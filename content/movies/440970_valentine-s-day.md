Ben Valentine (Rhys Muldoon) has totally lost his way in the world when he finds himself in a strange country town. With a sentence of 200 hours of community service, Valentine must coach the town's 'no-hoper' football team, who are teetering on the brink of demise. If the team don't win three out of the next four games, they'll be merged with their arch rivals and the town will also lose its precious pie factory. Valentine is embraced, heart and soul by the townsfolk. This one-time drifter learns how to live and hope again - and so does the town.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eEjUZ2dM3m1bcpHCJmsnikwOMk9.jpg", "actors": ["Rhys Muldoon (Ben Valentine)", "Roy Billing (Kevin Flynn)", "Freya Stafford (Mel)", "Anita Hegh (Sarah Hayes)", "Steve Rodgers (Wayne)", "Jacinta Stapleton (Delvene)", "Adam Zwar (Beak)", "Simon Lyndon (Bean)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
