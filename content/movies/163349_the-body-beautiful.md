At the heart of Onwurah\u2019s brave excursion into her mother\u2019s scorned sexuality is a provocative interweaving of memory and fantasy. The filmmaker plumbs the depths of maternal strength and daughterly devotion in an unforgettable tribute starring her real-life mother, Madge Onwurah.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2B2D1V7s9T10YE1zPALOOneWQzd.jpg", "actors": ["Saffron Burrows ()", "Maureen Douglass ()", "Sian Martin ()", "Valentine Nonyela ()", "Madge Onwurah ()", "Brian Bovell ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [162660], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
