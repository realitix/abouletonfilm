The locals are restless, though, because the presence of the tough lawmen makes them uneasy, they fear that town will soon be over run with blood\u2026\r\n\r\nDirected by Fred F. Sears and starring George Montgomery, Neville Brand, Buster Crabbe and Karin Booth, it\u2019s a compact Oater that spends a good portion of the film introducing the key players, which inevitably sets up the finale. Which thankfully is well worth the wait as it features a mother of a shoot-out, splendidly played out amongst burning barricades and bullets galore. A black and white production that clocks in at a brisk running time of an hour and ten minutes, it is a pic that never has chance to outstay its welcome, whilst being in the company of Brand and Montgomery is enjoyable for the duration. Not essential viewing for Western buffs, but a fun time assured regardless. 6.5/10"}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
