Filmed in 8 mm film there is a distinctive color and texture, and a seemingly nostalgic impression from the land pattern of Chichibu that is the stage, but it has an unknown sense of apprehension. A variety of emotions and scenes come to light, such as a sense of frustration, relief or fear, some kind of madness, or warmth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1piF0fiQGwkNKYbdVd1pry7SRfE.jpg", "actors": ["\u6e05\u6c34\u60a0 ()", "\u7b39\u4e45\u4fdd\u7d05\u7e54 ()", "\u9752\u6728\u5927\u8f14 ()", "\u6e05\u6c34\u9999\u5b50 ()", "\u57ce\u6238\u5927\u6a39 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
