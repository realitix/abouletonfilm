FILMAGE: The Story of DESCENDENTS/ALL follows drummer/square-peg Bill Stevenson and his 'caffeinated retardedness' as he pushes his rotating door of bandmates to 'achieve ALL,' his philosophy of going for greatness at all costs. Stevenson is a force to be reckoned with--not even grapefruit-sized brain tumors can keep him down.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kQMXaSTOnSYnbCDd7fhQIWkxyNY.jpg", "actors": ["Milo Auckerman (Self)", "Stephen Egerton (Self)", "Tony Lombardo (Self)", "Bill Stevenson (Self)", "Dave Smalley (Self)", "Doug Carrion (Self)", "Frank Navetta (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "yPb3dZ7Hqy8"}
