She is imprisoned in the flat, not sure what day it is and hardly remembers who of her relatives is still alive. Is it life? But everything is filled with meaning: life outside her window, worrying for her close ones and love toward those around her. That becomes more important than details of everyday reality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vx4F4ZOZbF2VNegCdle2OvSGAAu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
