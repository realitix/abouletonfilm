One participant was the avant-garde filmmaker Walter Ruttman, who had already begun to produce abstract films for advertising purposes at a time when his co-pioneers Viking Eggeling and Hans Richter were still preoccupied with painting. All the same, Ruttman placed his talent at the disposal of Nazi propagandists during the Third Reich. Dammbeck reflects upon the durability of the notion we term avant garde by vacillating it between the extremes of Modernism and anti-modernism. Hommage \u00e0 La Sarraz was at the core of the film footage deployed in Dammbeck's 'Hercules Media Collage' of 1984/85.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lOs8yqEd6hCSugwwCWUu5Jjp4tr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
