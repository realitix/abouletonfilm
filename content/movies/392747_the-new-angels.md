Sexual mor\u00e9s are contrasted, from the quaintly out-of-date courtship in Sicily to the sometimes uncomfortably explicit sexual references in the conversations of the youth at the opposite end of the country. Aside from these manners and morals, there is an examination of what happens when mechanized tools of production begin to take away from the human element at factories and in other industrial venues.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7uth8mV112jAF9RvLyoGaELOLQe.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
