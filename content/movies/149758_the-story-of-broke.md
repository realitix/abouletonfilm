But the truth is, our economy is broken, producing more pollution, greenhouse gasses and garbage than any other country. In these and so many other ways, it just isn\u2019t working. But rather than invest in something better, we continue to keep this \u2018dinosaur economy\u2019 on life support with hundreds of billions of dollars of our tax money. The Story of Broke calls for a shift in government spending toward investments in clean, green solutions\u2014renewable energy, safer chemicals and materials, zero waste and more\u2014that can deliver jobs AND a healthier environment. It\u2019s time to rebuild the American Dream; but this time, let\u2019s build it better.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
