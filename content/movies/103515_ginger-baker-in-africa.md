Baker was one of the first rock musicians to realize the potential of African music. He also decided that it would be a rewarding musical experience to travel to Nigeria over land across the Sahara desert - a journey that would lead him into a number of adventures. This film by Tony Palmer follows Ginger Baker's odyssey as he makes his journey and finally arrives in Nigeria to set up his studio, which would run successfully through the seventies as a facility for both local and western musicians (Paul McCartney's Wings recorded \"Band On The Run\" there).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5X58SM1p7ZzFHaszqVQbl6TMJe9.jpg", "actors": ["Ginger Baker (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
