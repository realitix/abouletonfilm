Intimate, harrowing and revealing, it is a story told by the young women who were supposed to be silenced by shame, fear and violence.  Photojournalist Mimi Chakarova, who grew up in Bulgaria, takes us on a personal investigative journey, exposing the shadowy world of sex trafficking from Eastern Europe to the Middle East and Western Europe. Filming undercover and gaining extraordinary access, Chakarova illuminates how even though some women escape to tell their stories, sex trafficking thrives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wNooCiEODwXTlZkTHlG28kynYt0.jpg", "actors": ["Mimi Chakarova (Voice)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "3ZGPEclrEEM"}
