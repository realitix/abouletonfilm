The boys pick up some girls, Kari and Vicki, and go for a ride up in the hills.  They intend to return the stolen car before Randal finishes baseball practice, but their adolescent hijinks spiral out of control.  The short film seems to be designed to make teenagers see that joyriding isn't just a bit of fun.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u4uFzEGzEG4ODciadtP5ERt4i9C.jpg", "actors": ["Kari Markussen (Kari)", "Victoria Paige Meyerink (Vicky)", "Tim Palladino (Tim)", "Val Thorgusen (Val)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [128998, 166711, 48277, 209752], "youtube_key": "8Ilx7dzPYuQ"}
