The embarrassed Nelson excuses himself and goes to his rooms in the same hotel. The woman rushes into his apartment followed by the man who met her in the hall. The man threatens her with violence and Nelson comes to her defense. In the ensuing fight, the man is knocked out of the window and falls to his death to the pavement many stories down. He is charged with the killing and his only witness that can prove self-defense for him has disappeared, and can not be found.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6IIKTtcnksK7P0LdnG2HLADih2f.jpg", "actors": ["William Powell (Jim Montgomery aka John Nelson)", "Marion Shilling (Edith Wentworth)", "Natalie Moorhead (Ethel Barry aka Ethel George)", "Regis Toomey (Tom Owens)", "Paul Hurst (Pete Shore)", "George Irving (Colonel Wentworth)", "Frederick Burt (Detective Lt.
