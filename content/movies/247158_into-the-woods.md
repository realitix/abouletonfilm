The popular tales of Red Ridinghood, Jack (of Beanstalk fame), Cinderella and Rapunzel are interwoven with that of the Baker and his Wife and their quest to have a child. However this re-telling goes beyond \"happily ever after\" as the familiar characters find themselves in unfamiliar circumstances and hopes and dreams are questioned and revisited.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iHrsk63uYuvAsuMMtUrFOEsFX9i.jpg", "actors": ["Marc Antolin ()", "Jenna Russell ()", "Valda Aviks ()", "Billy Boyle ()", "Judi Dench ()", "Gaye Brown ()", "Marilyn Cutts ()", "Helen Dalimore ()", "Mark Goldthorp ()", "Ethan Beer ()", "Sophie Caton ()", "Alice Fearn ()", "Amy Griffiths ()", "Mark Hadfield ()", "Eddie Manning ()", "Amy Ellen Richardson ()", "Beverley Rudd ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
