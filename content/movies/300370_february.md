A Wolf kills one of the sheep owned by two poor brothers who then start hunting the animal. They run, jump and sneak through the lonely snow-covered countryside. Biting cold, danger and toil everywhere. People do not live in this winterly realm, they survive; sometimes by mere chance: While they are away hunting the wolf, the two brothers evade the deportation of their entire village by Soviet authorities, accompanied by many casualties. Again, they follow a trail - only instead of a wolf\u2019s trail, they now follow one of footsteps and blood. The hostile mountains and dangerous nature, which seem to hold no love for men, suddenly appear in a different light: It is man himself who holds the least love for his fellow human beings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4F4UBE3giKxL5qGIAEz5U2Zc4pZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
