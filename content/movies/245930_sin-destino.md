His primary source of income is money raised by prostituting himself to men for sex, and the film implies that this learned behaviour has arisen as a result of a contact with a single man when Francisco was 9 years old. This man, Sebastien, is an \"artist\" who initially claimed to want to photograph the boy, but it is clear that their relationship at one time extended far beyond that of photographer/model.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xCEWQ8sreNt3jPkMXxbVF3RAItW.jpg", "actors": ["Francisco Rey (Fran)", "David Valdez (David)", "Roberto Cobo (Sebastian)", "Sylvia Vilchis (Perla)", "Arturo Ram\u00edrez (El Motas)", "Mariana Gaj\u00e1 ()", "Roberto Trujillo ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [274523, 108827, 148812, 412941], "youtube_key": "EScXLBQA0_o"}
