But he couldn't manage to write one.Falls in love in the process and writes his own story instead.\r\n\r\nThe final scene is to be predicted even after you read the title. \"Patron Mutlu Son \u0130stiyor\" meaning \"Boss wants a happy ending\", but still the final is cherished and romantic. \r\n\r\nSide characters are well scripted and merged into story very well.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what people expects from a romantic comedy , but it was a very good one indeed. \r\n\r\nLots of laughter , a good plot and very good acting.\r\n\r\n by enverfatih-akgun"}], "recommandations_id": [114553, 109856, 350830, 171158]}
