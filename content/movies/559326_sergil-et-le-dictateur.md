A lot of opponents of all kinds are intent on liquidating the dictator and they do not particularly like to have Sergil in their way. When Bijou, the inspector's fianc\u00e9e, accepts to serve as a bodyguard for the dictator, she is soon kidnapped and will not be released until Sergil tells them about their enemy's hiding place. Where the shoe pinches is that the dictator has disappeared and Sergil does not even know where he is.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AiUAjfGoguF8S7XoMY8m4oc18Ar.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
