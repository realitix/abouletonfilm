They value friendship over everything else, even family, and for this reason, Chandu resists the advances of Aravindan's sister Uma (Divya Unni). When the trio take up a painter's job at a mansion, Aravindan falls in love with Padmini (Meena), who lives there and Padmini's jealous cousin makes him believe that his overtures are reciprocated. When the truth is revealed and Padmini rejects him outright, Chandu stands up for his friend and speaks ill of her. This makes her swear to separate the friends.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/MpFC6ZEcnyXHi4E0pTQcLMzRxj.jpg", "actors": ["Jayaram (Aravindan)", "Mukesh (Chandu)", "Sreenivasan (Chackachamparambil Joy)", "Meena (Padmini)", "Divyaa Unni (Uma)", "Jagathy Sreekumar (Chackachamparambil Lasar)", "Janardhanan (Madhava Varma)", "Cochin Haneefa (Manager Sundareshan)", "V K Sreeraman (Sankara Menon)", "Sukumari (Ammayi)", "T.
