Her passion is anti-Semitism. Archival footage looks at her growing up in Wisconsin and taking the veil in her teens. Interviews with scholars and common people capture the extent to which \"Christ killers\" was a standard Catholic description of Jews. Sister Rose's research at Saint Louis University in the 1950s into the presentation of Jews within Catholic educational materials leads to the publication of \"Nostra Aetate,\" a document released in 1965 by the Second Vatican Council. Since that time, she's dedicated herself to eradicating anti-Semitism. The film ends with a critique of Mel Gibson's \"Passion of the Christ.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tnz9CVdHq0N3g2Fl6FKqySyFcnn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
