A swindler in search of his next art project, he hunkers down in the penthouse of would-be patrons the Beeders while they go on an extended vacation; he paints a mural on their wall, pawns their valuables and, along with the sculptor Abel, inadvertently smashes a large hole in their floor. Jimson's next project is an even larger wall in an abandoned church.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d51I6HuDzwEk5CWZE4E4Uegz3WF.jpg", "actors": ["Alec Guinness (Gulley Jimson)", "Kay Walsh (Dee Coker)", "Ren\u00e9e Houston (Sara Monday)", "Mike Morgan (Nosey)", "Robert Coote (Sir William Beeder)", "Michael Gough (Abel)", "Veronica Turleigh (Lday Beeder)", "Reginald Beckwith (Capt.
