The fish gasps for air and the fisherman holds it to his chest until it dies. This sequence\u2014performed by a series of fishermen, of various ages and using various styles of capture\u2014is the spine of the work, interrupted by passages of quiet natural beauty; one shot is a steady, stately pan through scores of trees and empty air behind.\" - Vinson Cunningham", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dYTjqyr7MVeu9g4DwJpou7ZbkER.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
