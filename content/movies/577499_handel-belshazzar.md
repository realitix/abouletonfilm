Written in 1745, Belshazzar stands with Messiah as one of Handel s finest efforts in the genre. Based on a libretto by Charles Jennens, the story, from the book of Daniel, recounts the fall of Babylon at the hands of the Persian prince Cyrus who brought Belshazzar s tyrannical reign to an end an eternally relevant story with significant current resonance. Featured soloists include countertenor Bejun Mehta, a rising star in the world s opera houses and concert halls.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4HNRvzNZ517wVxavNQUZRnR5ydP.jpg", "actors": ["Bejun Mehta ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
