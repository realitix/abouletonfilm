His brothers and sisters are all married and his dear mother - along with several other of her friends - is always asking him why he doesn't find a nice girl and get married. The truth is Marty is lonely and would like nothing better. He has very low self-esteem however and admits to his mother that he's ugly and no one wants him. He's tired of going to the Saturday night dance with his buddies and then going home more depressed than he was when the evening started. At one of those dances he meets Clara. They have a great deal in common but Marty will have to overcome peer pressure if he and Clara are to have a relationship.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/buyJNrVh5BPW1pDSj7K2fFOe9br.jpg", "actors": ["Rod Steiger (Marty Pilletti)", "Nancy Marchand (Clara - The Girl)", "Esther Minciotti (Mrs. Pilletti - Mother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
