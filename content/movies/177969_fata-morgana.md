Shot in the Libyan desert and in an abandoned building in Lausitz, Germany, it features a man (Christian Schmidt), a woman (Giuliana Pachner, from Bellavista) - and, glimpsed now and again, a guide (Awad Elkish.) They talk, they fall silent. Winds blow. The sun shines. The camera runs. What gradually takes shape is nothing less than a painstakingly concentrated attempt to understand the human condition through the lens of cinema. A lofty ambition, and one that demands a considerable leap of faith on the part of the audience: this film is sedate, \"difficult\", challenging, often apparently impenetrable. But anyone who has seen Schreiner's previous films will be aware that he is by any standards a major artist, one that can be trusted to find places that other directors may not even suspect exist.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9eI2FgMmWFeF2KRuo1LYkZHX6Bm.jpg", "actors": ["Giuliana Pachner ()", "Christian Schmidt ()", "Awad Elkish ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "zhi1GcmD9Ws"}
