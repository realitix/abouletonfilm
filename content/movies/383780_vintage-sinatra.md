VINTAGE SINATRA also features rare footage of Sinatra's heart-warming Valentine's Day performance of \"My Funny Valentine\" to a young, blushing Nancy Sinatra on \"The Frank Sinatra Show.\" This exceptional retrospective also features Sinatra's personal favorite genre, smoky, dark and swanky nightclub music.
