Combining stop-motion animation and sets with computer generated characters, backgrounds and effects creates a richly layered world that blurs the boundaries separating the living from the dead. Dynamic camera angles and lively music enhance the subtle, stylized performances of the living characters and the frenzied action of the spirits.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aIcc8daE7zK6PIec4vcM9TQxnyx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "FBKn6CPKGnA"}
