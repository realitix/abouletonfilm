The character animation looks like it was done 15 years before, but a lot of the elements are highly original; design (those trees!), use of camera focus.

The lesson here is: \"If you can't count on your friends, travel alone\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aplt3zwHpKsGIl5tp0eAHffUz9v.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
