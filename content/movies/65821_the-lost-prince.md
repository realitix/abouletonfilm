John suffered from epileptic seizures and an autism-like developmental disorder, and the Royal Family tried to shelter him from public view as much as possible; rather than presenting the Royal Family as unsympathetic to the Prince, the film instead shows how much this cost them emotionally (particularly John's mother, Queen Mary). Poliakoff explores the story of John, his relationship with his family, John's brother, Prince George, the political events going on at the time (like the fall of the House of Romanov in 1917) and the love and devotion shown to him by his nanny, Charlotte Bill (known as Lalla), played by Gina McKee.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nDFxSzQCVLWi0bJkVwVYvXOabLJ.jpg", "actors": ["Daniel Williams (Prince John (younger))", "Matthew James Thomas (Prince John (older))", "Brock Everitt-Elwick (Young Prince George)", "Rollo Weeks (Prince George (older))", "Tom Hollander (George V)", "Gina McKee (Charlotte Bill)", "Miranda Richardson (Queen Mary)", "Bill Nighy (Stamfordham)", "Michael Gambon (Edward VII)", "Bibi Andersson (Queen Alexandra)", "Ron Cook (Lloyd George)", "Frank Finlay (Asquith)", "John Sessions (Mr. Hansell)", "David Westhead (Fred)", "David Barrass (Kaiser Wilhelm)", "Paul Brennen (Orderly)", "James Cook (Henry)", "Jonathan Coy (Dr. Hetherington)", "Graham Crowden (Callender)", "Ingeborga Dapk\u016bnait\u0117 (Tsarina Alexandra)", "Mary Nighy (Young Mary)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [143150, 102867, 33827, 82404], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
