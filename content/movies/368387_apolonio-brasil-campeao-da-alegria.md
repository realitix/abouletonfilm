Quite a character, Apol\u00f4nio was loved by women, idolized by his audience and friends, besides being extremely high-spirited and charming. For all that, his brain is removed after his death and becomes the center of a dispute among an American scientist, Dr. B\u00f3ris, who wants to study it, his friends and his son Paluca. The film is an attempt to pay homage to the nightlife in Rio de Janeiro of the 50s, and to the \"chanchada\" a genre of musical-comedy typically Brazilian.  - Written by lukejoplin@infolink.com.br", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bPtzhgEluLFT6HEPlPsBgrnJPPO.jpg", "actors": ["Marco Nanini (Apol\u00f4nio Brasil)", "Louise Cardoso (Milu)", "Ant\u00f4nio Pitanga (Coice)", "Marcos Paulo (Paulo Antonio - Golden Night Owner)", "Sylvia Bandeira (D.
