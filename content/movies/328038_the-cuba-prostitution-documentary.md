The author, Andrew Lindy, is obsessed with beauty. A New York based fashion and travel photographer Andrew longs as much for connection as he does for beauty.  Being a travel photographer and having written travel articles for ELLE magazine, Andrew feels at home anywhere in the world... and as a fashion photographer, he is comfortable around beautiful women.  This is a look at the lack of sexual taboo in Cuba, as well as the financial difficulties that lead to prostitution in some Cubans, for the purpose of survival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tGJJbcXwTAk1brLoEaJSRgEDROE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
