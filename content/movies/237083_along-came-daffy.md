The two men fancy Daffy as a duck dinner and chase him around the cabin. Daffy tells them he is a cookbook salesman with a complimentary turkey dinner. The men let Daffy go and sit down to feast on turkey, but a group of famished mice suddenly appear and devour the bird before the men can raise a knife to carve. When Daffy returns to try to sell the men some after-dinner mints, they resume their hungry chase of Daffy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4HeL8zIZmxMacVKfyIOmS402uco.jpg", "actors": ["Mel Blanc (Daffy Duck / Yosemite Sam / Sam's Brother / Duck Decoys (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [236114, 199750, 235472, 163052], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
