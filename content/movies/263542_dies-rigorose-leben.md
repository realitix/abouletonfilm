Joe loves Rosa, and kills someone she had slept with because he thought their union was consentual (a rape), and he gets five years for the murder. When he is released from jail, his first priority is to attend his mother's funeral -- a death that has upset his sister so much that she is on the verge of a breakdown. His sister is supposed to marry a Mennonite, but is stuck on Joe and so that plan is scotched. Meanwhile, Rosa has taken up with another trucker, who is jealous of Joe and tries to kill him. The next thing anyone knows, the trailers and nearby buildings are going up in flames -- will Joe and Rosa survive to continue their desert saga?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9cfAVug47H4UnVRbV5gn3NdxF2t.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
