The people around him try in vain to convince him that five years have passed and that he's a rich guy. However, none of this makes sense to the character played by Miljan AND none of it makes any sense to the audience...none. After this plot is quickly abandoned, the film begins to get better. It seems that a wife and her business partner are trying to use Miljan as a double for her estranged and missing husband.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2I3c43T55UWERbnrAEhuXLOlwkg.jpg", "actors": ["John Miljan (Jerry Van Trevor/Jerry Werrenden)", "Shirley Grey (Chloe Werrenden)", "Monroe Owsley (Colton Drain)", "Hale Hamilton (Colonel Gordon Lewis)", "Robert Elliott (Sergeant Kerrigan)", "Wilson Benge (Greyson)", "Maurice Black (Feets)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
