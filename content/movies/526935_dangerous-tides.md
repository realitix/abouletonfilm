On board are berthed a group of sex crazed swingers, ready for some fun in the sun. Who's in charge of these hot blooded hedonists? None other than that gorgeous nymph, Jenna Jameson. Well, everything's just shipshape until they receive a dubious distress call from a sinking ship...The passengers are blissfully unaware as they frolic around on deck (a 7 girl orgy). Turns out the shipwreck victims are none other than a bunch of terrorists hell-bent on taking over the ship. Not if Jenna can help it. Get ready to be swept away by Dangerous Tides!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hPE4KIhM5OVfwe3JjqqE4rXNvy6.jpg", "actors": ["Jenna Jameson (Jenna)", "Angelica Sin ()", "Alexandra Silk ()", "Melissa Hill (Cynthia)", "Nici Sterling ()", "Ruby Jewel (Ruby)", "Missy (Sonja)", "Charlie ()", "Antonia ()", "Barocca ()", "Yvonne Scott ()", "Steve Drake ()", "Eric Price ()", "Vince Vouyer (Lt.
