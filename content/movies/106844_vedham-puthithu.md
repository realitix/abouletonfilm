Charuhasan, Saritha, Raja and 'Nizhalgal' Ravi played supporting roles in the movie. The story and dialogue was written by Kannan.  This is one of the few films that highlights some of the issues caused by the Caste system. The film's narrative was seamless and starred Sathyaraj as Balu Thevar. It contains some of Bharathiraja's trademark directorial touches as well as a lot of path breaking scenes, along with Kannan's powerful dialogues.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r2LwugUugcvLaCNDupoHIjIlPn8.jpg", "actors": ["Sathyaraj (Balu Thevar)", "Master Dasarathi (Sankaran)", "Saritha (Balu Thevar's Wife)", "Amala Akkineni (Vaidhehi)", "Raja (Sankara Pandi)", "Charu Haasan (Neelakanta Shasthrihal)", "Nizhalgal Ravi (Widowed Forest Ranger)", "Ilavarasu ()", "Janagaraj (Krishna Iyer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "UNrb08sFOOc"}
