The sprawling love story has proven a challenge to many filmmakers, but this version is acclaimed as the most successful. A sumptuous feature which took three years of planning and another for production, it was a hugely popular and critical hit which still stands out as a classic of both 18th century literature and 1960s moviemaking.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qLJlRRgl5UK1eAZeposk3YVdA7t.jpg", "actors": ["Betty Loh Tih (Lin Dai Yu)", "Yam Kit (Chia Bao Yu)", "Pat Ting Hung (Xue Bao Chai)", "Kong Hung (Xue Yan)", "Margaret Tu Chuan (Zi Juan)", "Carrie Ku Mei (Jin Chuan)", "Hung Mei (Madame Jia Tai)", "Chan Wan-Wa (Madame Wang)", "Lydia Shum (Little Fool)", "Kao Pao-shu (Elder brother's wife Wang Xifeng)", "Ding Ling (Xi Ren)", "Lily Mo Chou (Qing Wen, Boa Yu's maid)", "Chu Shao-Yuen (Gate keeper #1)", "Tien Feng (Gate keeper #2)", "Lai Man (Nanny)", "Yam Ho (Servant)", "Yi Fung (Servant)", "Yang Wen-Kai (Servant)", "Chan Ping (Servant)", "Ma Hsiao-Nung (Jinling Xue Yima)", "King Hu (Bei Ming)", "Zhou Chin (Zhen Chu)", "Chao Lei (2nd Master Jia Zheng)", "Guan Shan (Master Jia Lian)", "Yeung Chi-Hing (1st Master)", "Li Hsiang-Chun (1st Master's wife)", "Julie Shih Yen (Ying Chun)", "Man Oi-Lan (Tan Chun)", "Alison Chang Yen (Xi Chun)", "Paul Chang Chung (Guest)", "Got Ping ()", "Ivy Ling Po (Chia Bao Yu (singing))", "Carrie Ku Mei (Lin Dai Yu (singing))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
