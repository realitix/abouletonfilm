After an exhaustive and deep probing search, an ace reporter sniffs out two sizzling strumpets who'll do anything for the $20,000 prize money in a no-holds-barred Carnal Olympics. Event number one finds each team in a very hot girl-girl love making event where the judges give the gals a ten on technique alone. Event number two has each girl seducing an officer of the law in a hard-driving shoot out of a very personal nature. In the final and decisive event number three, a not-to-be-believed pool party turns into an orgy of truly Olympian proportions where everyone turns out to be a wild, wild winner.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5ILJMk9jITKfqCllFPUxlTwzSlt.jpg", "actors": ["Gail Sterling (Herself)", "Lynx Canon (Herself)", "Herschel Savage (Magazine Rep)", "Blair Harris (Team Gail Guy - Red Trunks)", "Kathy Kay (Team Lynx Girl - Dark Hair)", "Marguerite Nuit (Team Gail Girl - Dark Hair)", "Colleen ((credit only))", "Rhonda Jo Petty ((credit only))", "Tamara Kofenn ((credit only))", "Marcia Cassano ((credit only))", "Don Fernando (Team Gail Guy - White Trunks)", "Sabina Tramel (Team Lynx Girl - Blond Hair)", "Tony Cassano ()", "Paul Harmon (Policeman with Team Gayle)", "Ann Pierce (Team Gail Girl - Blond Hair)", "Carl Hall ()", "Dean Christal ()", "Reggie Gunn ()", "Jesse Adams (Team Lynx Guy - Blue Trunks (uncredited))", "Michael Morrison (Policeman with Team Lynx (uncredited))", "Jon Martin (Guy in Orgy (uncredited))", "Jack Mason (First Orgy Guy with Gail (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
