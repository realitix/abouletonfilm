Here, the hardy residents struggle for survival against the elements, and do a pretty good job of it (after all, they've been there longer than the audience has!) Especially well handled are the sequences involving the animal denizens of the snow-capped regions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k0ZxdFhQuWJL9Q5dz56yDbIiahc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
