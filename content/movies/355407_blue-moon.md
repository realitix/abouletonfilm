It is said that when a person sees a blue moon and makes a wish, he will be granted a second chance in things. This film is about two young men and a woman who are granted not only a second, but 120 chances. This is because the film is structured in such a way that its five reels of footage can be projected in random sequences every time it is screened and the story will still make sense - the number of possible combinations adds up to 120 times; each time there is a different story, different rhythm and different atmosphere.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hVIuQzbwI0RVE3fCL8WvpGrOmDY.jpg", "actors": ["Tarcy Su ()", "Leon Dai ()", "Lo Pei-An ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
