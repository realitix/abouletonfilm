When he learns that the attractive teacher, Ida, will lose her job if the immigrant isn't in attendance, he decides to go through with the erroneous assignment posing as the other guy. The short film is a comedy of errors, but works in some poignant and scathing observations about xenophobia.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f19w5kigjjNmlloFcjp2yoNK8oF.jpg", "actors": ["Martin Buch (Lars Hansen/El Hassan)", "Camilla Bendix (Ida)", "Farshad Kholghi (Omid)", "Martin Hestb\u00e6k (Niels)", "Michel Castenholt (Pelle)", "Anette St\u00f8velb\u00e6k (Receptionist Arbejdsformidlingen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
