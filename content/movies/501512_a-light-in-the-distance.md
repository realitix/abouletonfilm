Hearing a strong typhoon might strike, everyone has escaped the disaster. She checks her school, but no one is there. She meets her classmate, Fujii, unexpectedly. Fujii asks Mado to find a shelter together. He doesn't want to leave her alone. Both start looking around to see if anyone's left behind: An empty theatre, a movie is still running on the screen. A young girl stands by a desolated pool. A strip show theater with a retired stripper. An old man brushes his shoe in a bowling center continuously. Both guys search everywhere. And finally in the heavy rain, they find shelter in a factory. This is a factory where Mado's father had died in.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s0CO0xgQ3bLPNgZX2wP9M9vOrSF.jpg", "actors": ["Mariko Kobayashi ()", "Naoya Shimizu ()", "Kaori Takeshita ()", "Suzuna ()", "Kazunari Yanagitani ()", "Keisuke Yoshita ()", "Akaji Maro ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
