Frank Bough, Johnnie Walker, Richard Bacon and Angus Deayton are the stars featured as the circumstances surrounding their dismissal from the BBC are examined. Along with their cocaine use, Frank, Johnnie and Angus were caught in various sexually compromising positions, raising questions about the connection between drugs and sex.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/paspiRMeEyLXLBQYsvhzjdBVj96.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
