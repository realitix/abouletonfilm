This is by far the most informative video about the subject. Sadly to say,very few people have even heard of East Timor.As I live in politically correct Marin County, Most people don't even care, to know about this subject. I can only hope that they will remember Hitler and What the Nazi's did to the Jews. I think that the world needs to know that this invasion was greenlighted by Kissenger and Ford. If you want to find our more about the subject you can always buy our book at Amazon.com East of Java an adventure/drama soon to be a film by Scott Amour. \"Year of living dangerously meets Magnum PI.\""}], "recommandations_id": []}
