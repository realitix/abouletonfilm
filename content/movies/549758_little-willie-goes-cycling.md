His fond father and mother, accompanied by the nurse, mount their cycles and follow. But whereas Willie, by reason of his diminutiveness, can accomplish such feats as riding between two people, and between a man's legs, the elder riders cannot, and sad accidents occur. China of all sorts, barrows, etc., are brought to the ground with a crash, the devoted parents actually bringing down the wall of a shop in their anxiety to follow their little son. Finally, at home, little Willie rides in a most wonderful fashion, up the walls and ceiling and down again. The film is sure to be the most popular item in the program.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
