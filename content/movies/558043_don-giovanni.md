Mozart and the talented Italian librettist Lorenzo da Ponte. Based on Moli\u00e8re's Don Juan, the two-act dramma giocoso premiered in October 1787 at Prague's state theater to rave reviews. The 2017 Festival d'Aix-en-Provence brought Mozart's fabulously devious work to the stage once more in a production by stage director Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Sivadie. Starring Philippe Sly (Don Giovanni), Nahuel di Pierro (Leporello), and Eleonora Buratto (Donna Anna), the excellent performance featured the acclaimed maestro J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Rhorer at the head of the period instrument ensemble Le Cercle de l'Harmonie.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kR3ci2Wi7tIopoa2Q92mR81LjRz.jpg", "actors": ["Philippe Sly ()", "Pavol Breslik ()", "Nahuel Di Pierro ()", "Eleonora Buratto ()", "Isabel Leonard ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
