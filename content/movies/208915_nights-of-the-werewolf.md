The film is considered a lost film. It apparently was never theatrically released, nor has it ever turned up on video. Since Naschy insisted the script was filmed, it has come to be referred to as the second of the 12 Waldemar Daninsky werewolf movies, even though no one has ever seen it. To make matters even stranger, the lead actors whom Naschy attributed to this film (Peter Beaumont and Monique Brainville) apparently never existed. The \"French director\" Rene Govar seems to have directed only this one film as he has no other credits under his name on imdb.com. This is why most Naschy fans regard this movie listing as a hoax, some thinking that Naschy may even have made it up to boost his resume at a time when he was just starting out in the industry.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Paul Naschy (Waldemar Daninsky / Werewolf)", "Peter Beaumont ()", "Monique Brainville ()", "Beba Novak ()", "Helene Vatelle ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
