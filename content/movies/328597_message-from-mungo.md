Message from Mungo focuses on the interface over the last 40 years between the scientists on one hand, and, on the other, the Indigenous communities who identify with the land and with the human remains revealed at the site. This interface has often been deeply troubled and contentious, but within the conflict and its gradual resolution lies a moving story of the progressive empowerment of the traditional custodians of the area.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ymxNvgf4zeWapjYSb8Yk7RAEVmO.jpg", "actors": ["Alice Kelly (Herself)", "Tibby Briar (Herself)", "Alice Bugmy (Herself)", "Isabel McBryde (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "JOuHgVss9Wk"}
