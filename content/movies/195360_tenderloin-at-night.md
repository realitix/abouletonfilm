Gordon Murray or anyone like that. Thomas Edison, the pioneer of moving pictures themselves, also gave us the first exploitation movie! Running a scant 2 mins 2 secs the movie offers us a look inside what is supposed to be a brothel in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
