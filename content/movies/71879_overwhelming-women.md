This attractive, 30-year-old successful graphic designer with a captivating personality hasn't had a good date in over a year, and she's not alone - her best friends share the same problem. They all dream about finding their prince charming, and all too often settle for the frog. At the agency, instead of Mr. Right, Laura meets Miguel, who has all the signs of Mr. Wrong: he's a blue-collar, unpolished simple man. They seem to have nothing in common. However, there just might be more to him than meets the eye.
