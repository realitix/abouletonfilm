Calling each other by the competing names they gave the cat, Maru and Lily, the odd pair is abruptly sucked into a political conspiracy with Saeko (Yui Ichikawa) and her son at the center. Witnessing another injustice in which the economic and social elite prey on the vulnerable, the two strays set off on the road to redemption, or at least peaceful cat ownership. (Fun fact: in addition to acting together in Alley Cat, Yosuke Kubozuka and Kenji \u201cKJ\u201d Furuya released the single \u201cSoul Ship\u201d in 2017. Kubozuka performs as Manji Line and Furuya in the band Dragon Ash.) -JAPAN CUTS: Festival of New Japanese Film", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w3P68nCVTlEOPCKddYNjRIp8pLC.jpg", "actors": ["Yosuke Kubozuka (Maru)", "Kenji Furuya (Lily)", "Yui Ichikawa (Saeko)", "Baba Ryouma (Kengo Hashimoto)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
