With everything gone overnight, Seung-woo spends every day meaninglessly in a small attic room but is comforted by Ga-hee who is like a mother, a sister and a lover.  He starts developing feelings for her while writing poems and reading books with sounds of piano played by Ga-hee in the background.  It's been a year since Seung-woo stayed in that house, then one cold winter night, he leaves behind a note thanking the lady for everything. Thirteen years later, Seung-woo, Dong-hee and Ga-hee reunite but he's become a corrupted 32-year old addicted to smoking, drinking and women. The two girls can't help but be shocked at the way he turned out.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qreyRzr5ubeg5DRarJtiFtHg8ML.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
