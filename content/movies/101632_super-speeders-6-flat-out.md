Follow Rob as he takes you to Italy to put the Lamborghini Aventador through its paces with Lamborghini's famous test driver Valentino Balboni. The crew also stops in at the Pagani factory to see the new  Huayra before heading up to northern Italy to drive one of the worlds greatest roads, the Stelvio Pass. You'll also sit shotgun and follow Rob, Matt, and Shivam on another epic high speed ticket fest on a rally from New York to Las Vegas. Of course a Super Speeders DVD wouldn't be complete without all the high horsepower hijinx, burnouts, 200+ mph driving, crashes, and destruction of some of the worlds crappiest cars in the most creative of ways. Strap in and get ready for another wild ride.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/onhzeX7uVfX1o6nLvhwUfsBbCCl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "tu14sqeHYqw"}
