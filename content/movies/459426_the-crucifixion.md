Much of the suspicion centres on his fellow trucker Chan (Shing Fui-on), particularly when the victim's wife is killed as well. When not only Chan, but the nosy stray dog are added to the growing number of victims, attention is focused on an arrangement which the drivers had with a Chinese prostitute named Yin-fong. She had been their secret liaison in Shenzhen, and committed suicide when the men refused to let her stop providing her services to them. Yin-fong's twin sister Mei-ping (Miki Ng) also becomes a suspect, but yet another murder provides her with an alibi. Officers Ho Tin-nam and Jacky are faced with a plethora of red herring leads and an escalating body count before they can bring the real killer to justice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2nong0iAEg2sKYRfLVqbN8Dz0O5.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Chow Man-Kin (Inspector Ho Tin Lam)", "Hilary Tsui (Jacky Wong)", "Timothy Zao (John)", "Ivy Leung Si-Man ()", "William Ho Ka-Kui (Yau Teng Kin)", "Teresa Ha Ping (Yau's mother)", "Mikie Ng (Tang Mei Ping)", "Jay Lau (Wah's wife)", "Dick Liu (Leung Chi Wah)", "Joyce Geung Yung (Lam's friend)", "Helena Law Lan (Jogger [cameo])", "Shing Fui-On (Chan Fu)", "William Duen (Inspector Ko)", "Billy Ching Sau-Yat (Suen Tai Pang)", "Rico Chung Kai-Cheong (Father Chung)", "Wellson Chin (Big Eyes)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
