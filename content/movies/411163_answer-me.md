The interior of this abandoned dome is characterized by an extraordinarily long echo, which provoked Sala to stage a story there \"whose drama would come under the influence of the building\". The narrative is inspired by Michelangelo Antonioni, who wanted to shoot the silences in a couple's break-up. In Answer Me, the stillness becomes a loud stillness of silencing decibels: a woman tries to end a relationship, but her lover refuses to listen, playing fiercely on a drum set to silence her. Next to her, the drumsticks resting on a single drum play to the echo of his drumming.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jwDNpWrlvcmMzIjmpzONUhrqq5X.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
