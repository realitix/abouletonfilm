It is also the region where most of the crop circles appear, each summer. What are they and where do they come from? No one really knows. Many different theories abound from the new age/earth energy movement, to UFOs, to mundane based conspiracy theories. Many people have different opinions on what crop circles are and what they mean. Several of them are granted a voice to express their views. In addition, scientific evidence is provided showing the cellular effects on the plants to describing the trace materials found in and among the plants in many of the patterns.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
