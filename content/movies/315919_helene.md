Madeleine Renaud essays the title role, a young medical student in love with aspiring musician Pierre Regnier (Jean-Lous Barrault). Pierre's father, a noted surgeon, puts pressure on his son to give up music in favor of medicine. Unable to withstand his father's remonstrations, Pierre kills himself, prompting the grieving Madeleine to forget all about romance and dedicate her life to the cause of healing others. Wilfur avoids the usual soap-opera goo by offering realistic performances and credible dialogue (the English-language subtitles were composed by erudite film critic Herman G. Weinberg).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yo7VF4BeoWA0NAAafmmdWo1LEtQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
