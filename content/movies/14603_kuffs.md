It's a romance-comedy- no wait, it's a cop-comedy. Then comes the bullet-riddled death count and it's clear this is a confused piece of cinema, in which even the fifth-wall is broken. All this playfulness needn't had been a bad thing, except here it merely culminates to an early-nineties mess. Some recipes with a large list of ingredients work, some don't; in this film, there's simply no room left for an audience to get comfortable. Slater being Slater (or Jack Nicholson) is the redeeming card, if of course, that is you like him. Kuffs is ultimately a bit of fun, even if the film itself doesn't always know it."}], "recommandations_id": [11384, 18658, 8428, 10694], "youtube_key": "sr4TF6zT9xM"}
