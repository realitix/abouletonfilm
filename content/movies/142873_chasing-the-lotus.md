Their shots captured on celluloid became the images for such films as Stylemasters, The Forgotten Island of Santosha, Big Wednesday, Pacific Vibrations, Uluwatu and many more. This documentary is a cinematic journey inspired by many of the reels that were lost in the making of these films. Since that time, these reels have resurfaced and are now brought to light. A fusion of rare super 8mm film, photo stills and contemporary interviews blend together to make Chasing the Lotus the most in-depth look at the evolution of the surf culture and surf discovery ever made.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uN8VTaCv5BFIjIbcZjunf3NUVF6.jpg", "actors": ["Jeff Bridges (Narrator)", "Stacy Peralta (Himself)", "Gerry Lopez (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
