The constantly recurring motifs of suspense and clich\u00e9s of plot make it possible to move seamlessly among scenes from different films with different protagonists: uneasy sleep, getting up, listening at the door, turning on the lights, being startled, etc. In the montage, the movements and gestures of the actresses \u2013 stars like Lana Turner, Tippi Hedren, and Grace Kelly\u2013 seem choreographed and planned for each other. The soundtrack supports this effect with connecting passages of sound that imitate the stereotypes of the genre. The treatment concentrates the dramatic shift from the familiar to the eerie and shows how women become the victims of the voyeuristic glance of film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2CCeOfblebZnJvQPRSGsXqD1FFR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
