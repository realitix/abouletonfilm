While visiting the Wax Museum a group of tourists stop in front of the figure of Prince Metternich. All of a sudden they find themselves brought back 150 years earlier during the Vienna Congress of 1814-1815. Before their eyes wide open, history is in the making. Gathered around the Tsar of Russia, Alexander I, the Kings of Bavaria, W\u00fcrtemberg, Prussia and Denmark, are persuaded they are building the future Europe whereas they are being manipulated by foxy Chancellor Metternich, he himself under the thumb of cynical Count Talleyrand, the French representative. All those considerations come second though to partying and social life, which is all these aristocrats really want out of this congress.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8BfPoxwsrXEpqeGLLLR17i5PDZQ.jpg", "actors": ["Curd J\u00fcrgens (Zar Alexander I. von Russland)", "Lilli Palmer (F\u00fcrstin Metternich)", "Hannes Messemer (F\u00fcrst Metternich)", "Walter Slezak (Der 'Ewige Wiener')", "Paul Meurisse (Talleyrand)", "Fran\u00e7oise Arnoul (Gr\u00e4fin Kopinskaja)", "Wolfgang Kieling (Napoleons Doppelg\u00e4nger)", "Gustav Knuth (Stefans Vater)", "Brett Halsey (Baron Stefan Abonyi)", "Kurt Meisel (Juwelier Semmelbein)", "Lukas Ammann (Friedrich von Gentz)", "Franz Muxeneder (R\u00e4uberhauptmann Grasl)", "Helga Anders (Anni Leithner)", "Hannelore Bollmann (Herzogin von Sagan)", "Herbert Fux (Sekret\u00e4r von Gentz)", "Else Rambausek (Zofe bei Rosa)", "Hannes Schiel (Emperor Franz Josef)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
