The band's videos are equally as turbulent, inspiring and outrages. The sound of British rock had finally woken up with the help of Ginger, one of Britain's most daring and brilliant songwriters. The band's flare for the unusual and diverse would also be reflected in their videos.  The Wildhearts, sometimes difficult, sometimes infuriating, but always exciting!
