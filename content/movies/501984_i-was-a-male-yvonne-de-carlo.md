It opens with the excerpt from No President originally called \"Marsh Gas of Flatulandia\" - several minutes of black and white footage of steam escaping from manholes segues to an interior scene of various creatures emerging from dry ice vapors - then shifts to show the filmmaker, clad in a leopard skin jump suit, attended by a nurse as he sits amidst the detritus of his duplex loft. A fan presents him with a black-and-white glamour shot to autograph as Ondine, dressed entirely in black leather, snaps his picture. Violence erupts as the nurse takes out a whip to discipline the star's fans. When a female creature pulls out the same dagger depicted in the glamour shot, Smith jumps up and shakes the weapon from her hand. The action is post-scripted with footage of a steam shovel patrolling the rubble where the Broadway Central hotel once stood.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jack Smith ()", "Ondine ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
