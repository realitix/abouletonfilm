At the start of the film Lars Erik and his wife Sonja are doing well on the Baltic island of Bornholm. Lars Erik is a successful fisherman, Sonja is a traditional housewife, proud of their new house bulging with consumer goods. Their love for each other is the sturdy footing on which their home is founded. Lars Erik employs three men on his trawler, and spends as fast as he earns, so when fishing quotas are cut he faces a crisis. One by one his men leave the boat, but he refuses to give up. Being a fisherman is like being a farmer - you depend on the wealth of mother nature herself. However, mother nature is like romance, highly capricious!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dUsMfUw3tyUQjPjzwsT4EmAlrzY.jpg", "actors": ["Sofie Stougaard (Sonja)", "Henrik Lykkegaard (Lars Erik)", "Michelle Bj\u00f8rn-Andersen (Karen)", "Isidor Torkar (Francisco)", "Thomas Bo Larsen (Ib)", "Helle Dolleris (Bibi)", "S\u00f8ren Hauch-Fausb\u00f8ll (Flemse)", "Christoffer Barnekov (Svensk n\u00f8genbader)", "Willy Lund Hansen (Benny)", "Benjamin Hansen (Kenneth)", "Jesper Asholt (Finn Ole)", "Martin Buch (Flade)", "Jette Frovin Jensen (Kassedame)", "S\u00f8s Karlson (Servitrice)", "Bodil Lundquist (Bankdame)", "Lone Madsen (Bartender)", "Preben Harris (Ernst)", "Pernille Grumme (Adoptionsdame)", "Anna Norberg (Else)", "Thorkild Westh (Havnmand)", "Hans Kristian N\u00f8rregaard (Skolel\u00e6rer)", "Peter Skram (\u00c6ldre betjent)", "Niels Ole Blem (Brugsbestyrer)", "Eske Thorlund (Lille Oluf)", "Holger Anker Kofod (Fotograf)", "Stig Kofoed (Tavse Oluf)", "Leo Mortensen (Fiskeopk\u00f8ber)", "Elias Manniche M\u00f8ller (William)", "Peer Letholm Nielsen (Konferencier)", "Kjeld N\u00f8rgaard (Gustav)", "Terese Damsholt (L\u00e6ge)", "Nichita Frederiksen (Belinda)", "Ulla Gottlieb (Evelyn)", "Erling Haagensen (Havbiolog)", "Annemette Henriksen (Kassedame)", "Barbara Jakobsen (Bente)", "Troels II Munk (Skibsm\u00e6gler)", "Grete Nordr\u00e5 (Line)", "Carl Press (Havbiolog)", "Peter Steen (Jannick)", "Christer Sj\u00f6gren (Himself)", "Peter Aalb\u00e6k Jensen (Dumpo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
