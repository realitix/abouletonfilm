June, a young college boy, finds his resources in depletion, and to improve his financial condition, proposes to October, a wealthy spinster of the \"where-is-he\" stage, and is accepted with avidity, and so these two soul \"mis\"-mates start their engagement inning. Later, December, a wealthy old bachelor, proposes to May, a pretty miss of eighteen, and the promise of fine gowns, jewels and automobiles, so dear to the heart of the fair sex, induces her to accept with half-hearted tolerance, hence they also start the engagement period. Everything goes finely until the quartet meet.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pqMgpyMUeEMPK9PyDLU65qm2KJk.jpg", "actors": ["Mary Pickford (May)", "Billy Quirk (June)", "Kate Bruce (October)", "W.
