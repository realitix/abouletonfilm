A woman lies at the bottom of a swimming pool, alone. The camera pans her body. She starts to rise, then sinks; convulsions follow and then she rises and hovers above the pool. A shirtless man in white pants stands in an asphalt lot, a car visible on either side. Convulsions begin. The cars back up, still facing him and each other. They pause; they race toward him. He leaps. A youth, shirtless and in white shorts, stands in front of a tall building. Doors open, he enters and walks to an elevator. Convulsions strike him as he rides to a top floor, exits the elevator, pauses, and runs toward a window. He crashes through.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pcj3P1n5C4T6f3YqQzxz2TfsOaM.jpg", "actors": ["Kasia Werstak (Ritual 1)", "Daniel Askill (Ritual 2)", "Jordan Askill (Ritual 3)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [207063], "youtube_key": "UIg8bHnW9vk"}
