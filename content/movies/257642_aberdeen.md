Likewise, the Cheng family embodies a microcosm of our city, with its contradictions between modernity and traditions, family and individuality. Aberdeen is at once intimate and sprawling, revealing uniquely troubled characters, from the eldest, the Taoist priest patriarch Dong, to the youngest, the bullied elementary schooler Chloe. Pang mixes his signature humor with the fantastical, incorporating dreams, the supernatural and other surprises to distinguish this star-studded film from ordinary family drama.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7Hy7wnGQLhoxzzrFHyPfUWDE0WP.jpg", "actors": ["Louis Koo ()", "Gigi Leung ()", "Eric Tsang ()", "Miriam Yeung ()", "Carrie Ng ()", "Ng Man-Tat ()", "Jacky Cai ()", "Chapman To ()", "Shawn Yue (Dan)", "Dada Chan (Van)", "Yumiko Cheng Hei-Yi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [367196, 48417], "youtube_key": "G9LE78Y-MWQ"}
