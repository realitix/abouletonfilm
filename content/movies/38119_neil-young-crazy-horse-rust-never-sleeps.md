The concept of the show is high (for Young, anyway), if rather odd: roadies (here called \"Road Eyes\") decked out like Jawas from Star Wars, stage announcements from the original Woodstock during set changes, and giant amps, microphones, and so on for an \"Incredible Shrinking Man\" effect. Of course, it's the music that counts, and there's plenty of that, what with nearly 20 songs (including two versions of \"Hey Hey, My My,\" his nod to the punk movement), acoustic and electric (with longtime companions Crazy Horse), dating back to his Buffalo Springfield days (\"I Am a Child\") and continuing through popular solo numbers like \"Cinnamon Girl\" and the extended \"Like a Hurricane.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u80wKUVdLl5czOqaQMFrQ3UtjNs.jpg", "actors": ["Neil Young (Himself)", "Ralph Molina (Himself)", "Billy Talbot (Himself)", "Frank Sampedro (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
