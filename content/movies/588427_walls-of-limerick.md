This project uses the medium of film and aerial dance to distort the audience\u2019s perception of what is physically possible, altering reality and creating an illusionary body/spirit dissociation.  The film creators draw from Limerick's history and culture to influence both the narrative and some of the film\u2019s imagery. The title alludes both to the well-known Irish dance and to stories of the city, from the Vikings and the siege of Limerick (1690) to the current cultural and social realities of Limerick.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
