The DVD includes a short bonus feature music video called \"We're Going to China\".\r\n\r\nThe TV show is modeled on Dora the Explorer, except it teaches Mandarin instead of Spanish. Unfortunately, there's much less emphasis on the language than there might be. Much seems aimed at heritage Chinese kids, and deals with customs, etc., while Kai-Lan and her animal friends encounter zany situations."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
