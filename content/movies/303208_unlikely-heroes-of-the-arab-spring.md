The program shows that \"The Arab Spring\" was less a political event than it was about the coming of the industrial revolution to a region where over 90% of the population lives and works outside the rule of law. De Soto shows us that this informal economy is, however, the one common thread that can contribute to the region's growth and stability.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
