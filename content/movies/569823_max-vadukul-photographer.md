Vadukul described it as \"not an MTV, or VH1 kind of thing ... It's more serious.\" The documentary examined his catalogue photography for Victoria's Secret and his regular work for publications such as Mademoiselle, GQ and other Cond\u00e9 Nast magazines along with portraits of a wide range of subjects, attributing Vadukul with \"a smart, fast, and wry style borne of a personal history that reads like a novel.\" Vadukal has shot at least a dozen covers for Rolling Stone magazine and has also worked for Italian Vogue, Vogue Hommes International, i-D, Chlo\u00e9 and Armani.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t4zFKnThzxwikkM0ogfNS7cXxKo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
