But Also..., for the country back in 1971. Rob Brydon narrates this very special programme as Pete and Dud fans, friends and colleagues watch these newly discovered clips in the studio for the very first time. The programme includes contributions from Not Only... But Also... producer Dick Clement, Pete and Dud collaborator Barry Humphries, and long-time fans Richard Ayoade, Josie Lawrence, Will Sharpe and Ronnie Wood as they enjoy the sketches and reflect on the career of one of Britain's best-loved comedy partnerships.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kq8Rw69AOXcQBPWSLbt3rAkSeK2.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Cook (Himself (archive material))", "Dudley Moore (Himself (archive material))", "Rob Brydon (Narrator (Voice))", "Barry Humphries (Himself)", "Dick Clement (Himself)", "Richard Ayoade (Himself)", "Ronnie Wood (Himself)", "Harry Shearer (Himself)", "Josie Lawrence (Herself)", "Will Sharpe (Himself)", "Dick Fiddy (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
