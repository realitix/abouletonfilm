The letter was printed under the heading \u2018I\u2019m Not Here\u2019. Using that story as its inspiration, this film about shop assistants and boredom wittily combines extracts from a Harrods' training video and original footage from 'Miss London Stores 1970'.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
