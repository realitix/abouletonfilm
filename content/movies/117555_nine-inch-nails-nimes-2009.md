We worked in lossless 720p format until the final mpeg2 compression  This show, including soundtrack, has been recovered from original fan recordings. Some parts have bad quality by lack of sources, we're sorry for that. Soundtrack has been recovered separately from the video.  We recovered with respect for the sources, there has been only one final video compression, sound isn't even compressed.
