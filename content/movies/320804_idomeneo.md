During a squall at sea, Idomeneo -- the king of Crete -- swears to Neptune that if the monarch survives, he'll sacrifice the first person he encounters onshore. Tragically, that person ends up being his son, Idamante (Frederica Von Stade). Maestro James Levine masterfully conducts the orchestra and chorus of the Metropolitan Opera.  A musical production that was designed for the \"Live From the Met\" series, this program was produced by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jWd1G10I8LXwfZgojmgfG02gmSb.jpg", "actors": ["Luciano Pavarotti (Idomeneo)", "John Alexander (Arbace)", "Hildegard Behrens (Elettra)", "Ileana Cotrubas (Ilia)", "Frederica von Stade (Idamante)", "Timothy Jenkins (High Priest)", "Loretta di Franco (Women of Crete)", "Batyah Godfrey Ben-David (Women of Crete)", "Charles Anthony (Trojan Soldiers)", "James Courtney (Trojan Soldiers)", "Richard J.
