At job orientation, she meets her gratingly enthusiastic boss Frances (\u201cyou can call me Fran\u201d), played by Erika Batdorf, and a happily spacey co-worker, played by Lesley Loksi Chan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gn0G16YWGDMjAEn4W1admRs9m43.jpg", "actors": ["Katherine Cullen ()", "Erika Batdorf ()", "Lesley Loksi Chan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
