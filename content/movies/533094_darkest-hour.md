It seemed no man, woman or child was safe from the North Bend Reaper, a crafty serial killer who became infamous for stealing patches of clothing from his bloodied victims. Despite a massive manhunt, the Reaper was never found. Fast forward to the present - a group of actors try to cash in on the town's notoriety by hosting an interactive murder mystery party based on the unsolved killings. After isolating their guests at an abandoned summer camp, they come to the terrifying conclusion that someone in their midst is killing them off one by one. Has someone chosen to continue the North Bend Reaper's bloody legacy? Or has the Reaper himself come back for one last dance with death?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ftJ4sST4Tc8uFpvamXjnhZivWu0.jpg", "actors": ["Todd Hann (Ben Traimer)", "Tristan Risk (Therese)", "Dave Cote (Tibor Sigur)", "Lisa Sowden (Janice)", "Benjamin Gutknecht (Dreighton Sawyer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
