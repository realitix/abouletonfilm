Ingmar Bergman intended FANNY AND ALEXANDER as his swan song, and it is the director\u2019s warmest and most autobiographical film, an Academy Award\u2013winning triumph that combines his trademark melancholy and emotional intensity with immense joy and sensuality. Bergman described FANNY AND ALEXANDER, presented here in the five-hour television version, as \u201cthe sum total of my life as a filmmaker.\u201d And in this, the full-length (312-minute) version of his triumphant valediction, his vision is expressed at its fullest.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/srZOZJtOtZkNvQ79R5mBA4RG2lF.jpg", "actors": ["Kristina Adolphson ()", "Bertil Guve ()", "Pernilla Allwin ()", "Allan Edwall ()", "Erland Josephson ()", "Ewa Fr\u00f6ling ()", "Jan Malmsj\u00f6 ()", "Gunn W\u00e5llgren ()", "B\u00f6rje Ahlstedt ()", "Harriet Andersson ()", "Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand ()", "Stina Ekblad ()", "Mats Bergman ()", "Pernilla August ()", "Mona Malm ()", "Jarl Kulle ()", "Kerstin Tidelius ()", "Christina Schollin ()", "Inga \u00c5lenius ()", "Hugo Hasslo ()", "Kristian Almgren ()", "Carl Billquist ()", "Axel D\u00fcberg ()", "Siv Ericks ()", "Patricia G\u00e9lin ()", "Majlis Granlund ()", "Maria Granlund ()", "Eva von Hanno ()", "Sonya Hedenbratt ()", "Olle Hilding ()", "Svea Holst ()", "K\u00e4bi Laretei ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
