Should we accept what life offers to us on a platter or should we try to chase our dreams, taking the path less taken? That\u2019s the question our protagonists Gaurav, Manav, Pankaj and Loveleen seek answer to, as they decide to embark upon an eventful journey that will change the course of their lives and careers forever. The one thing that unites these four friends is their common love for badminton. Every evening they meet for a couple of games in their neighborhood joking about their lives and pulling each other\u2019s legs. This part of the day is the most pleasant part of their otherwise dreary lives. While playing badminton one such night, they decide to do something on their own. This very attempt becomes their lifeline putting them on a litmus test of determination, courage, luck and spirit of friendship.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dMHdKTqlhesbooLvjZqhEW8Igt0.jpg", "actors": ["Alok Kumar (Pankaj)", "Aakar Kaushik (Manav)", "Vijay Prateek (Gaurav)", "Manish Nawani (Loveleen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "8KwKNvlfKJQ"}
