Humphrys' jazz combo, the Red Onion Jazz Band, was widely regarded as Australia's finest trad jazz outfit, and when rock & roll became the dominant sound in pop music in the early 1960s, Humphrys embraced the new style as lead vocalist with the upbeat R&B ensemble the Loved Ones, which won him legions of new fans.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zjfY2cPKoIeJwoj35HVSLbfjoYh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
