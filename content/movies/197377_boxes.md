Rooms are full of boxes which contain a lot of things and plenty of memories. Anna has lived many lives and her past comes out of these boxes. Her parents surely, but also her children and their fathers, the living and the dead. In this breakneck period of her life, time is running faster and faster and Anna takes a run-up to face the past and try to go towards the future. And, maybe, to manage to still believe in love?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oWVASvUQpnMrVuSukqVzffTT83X.jpg", "actors": ["Geraldine Chaplin (Maman)", "Michel Piccoli (Papa)", "Jane Birkin (Anna)", "Natacha R\u00e9gnier (Fanny)", "Lou Doillon (Camille)", "Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos (Lilly)", "John Hurt (Le p\u00e8re de Fanny)", "Maurice B\u00e9nichou (Max)", "Tch\u00e9ky Karyo (Jean)", "Annie Girardot (Jos\u00e9phine)", "Serge Lafaurie (Le grand-p\u00e8re)", "Diana Payne-Myers (Mme Martin)", "Jacques Cara\u00ebs (Le jeune homme du bateau)", "Jacques Baratier (Le petit veuf)", "Paul Nehr (M.
