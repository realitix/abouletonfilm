Alex was assigned to the male gender at birth. She knows that this assignment was wrong. In a world she's living, she doesn't exist. Bodies are normed, people are squared, society hypnotised. The people do not believe what they see with their own eyes. Somewhere in the middle of concrete. All buildings look the same. Alex and her job-seeking mother share a small flat in a gray apartment block. A women's menage. A women's menage? Alex starts to shave her face. Both women leave the building and they split up. In front of the school a photographer stops her. His name is Christian Strange. He calls her 'Beautiful woman'. Will everything become well now?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jN46el1aziwxQvGURlVfsv6uDgD.jpg", "actors": ["Dorothea Baltzer (Dorothea Baltzer)", "Werner Braunsch\u00e4del ()", "Trischa Dorner ()", "Folkert D\u00fccker ()", "Marie Fischer ()", "Barbara K\u00fchnel ()", "Robin La Baume ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
