It's an introduction to a bright new future where companies tell the truth and work hard to create better products and a better planet. Corporations have incredible influence on the world we live in and that's given them free reign to pollute, collude and mislead us, but advances in technology are rapidly making them accountable not just to shareholders, but to everyone. Now that we have constant access to the truth about the products we use and the ethics of the companies behind them, big brands are realizing that looking great isn't enough. It's time to actually be great.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lnAl5DaTLJHoY6PQQOojeSIMkOg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
