Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is still continuing to do the bloody work of the dead John Kramer/Jigsaw (Tobin Bell). In his sights is William Easton (Peter Outerbridge), an unfeeling insurance head who turned down claims by Kramer and a myriad of others on pathetic technicalities. Cue more elaborate traps, painful decisions and some twisty devilment. Yep! It's another Saw movie.\r\n\r\nSomewhat surprisingly, part 6 is a step up in quality of writing and ingenuity of gore/trap factors from the previous two installments. It's still very much old hat as a formula, and once again the sequences of Bell used in flashback show him to be the franchise's strength. However, the makers put at the core an insurance issue that everyone can identify with, whilst piling on mystery and suspense by way of Jigsaw's left envelopes and the FBI closing in on an increasingly overt confident Hoffman. 7/10"}], "recommandations_id": [11917, 663, 41439, 214]}
