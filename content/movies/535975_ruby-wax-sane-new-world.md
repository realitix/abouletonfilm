Ruby knows this only too well. She has been on a tough but enlightening journey through depression which has taken her from The Priory through to an MA from Oxford University in Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy.  This show helps us all understand why we sabotage our sanity, how our brains work and how we can rewire our thinking to find calm in a frenetic world. Helping you become the master, not the slave, of your mind, this show is your route to saner living.
