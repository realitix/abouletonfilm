It includes full instructions for making your own hams, bacon and sausages, and much more besides. You don't have to be a pig-keeper to enjoy this package - just a pig enthusiast,\" says Hugh. \"Anyone who likes pigs and pork, and wants to find out how and why the best pork comes from the happiest pigs, will get a great deal out of it,\" he adds. Here at River Cottage HQ, we are passionate about Pigs. They are the most charming of all our domesticated livestock, arguably the most delicious, and certainly the most versatile.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8PklCeA2CrEdsFTOpuF0DIB38qK.jpg", "actors": ["Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
