Actually, Bill Wright, Mitchell's associate, killed Carter because the ranger had discovered tussock moth infestation in the forest, and if the infestation was not reported, the trees would die and have to be cut, thereby profiting Mitchell and Wright. In order to compensate the best he can, Gene sells his sportsman's camp and gives the money to Carter's daughter Helen . En route to Texas, Gene discovers the infestation and is assigned by the Forest Department to supervise the program of spraying the area with DDT from the air. After the first day of spraying, the DDT is blamed by furious stock men for the many animals found dead of poisoning.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dnJ4LqEkW8Di1GYlQWP0eGv5f21.jpg", "actors": ["Gene Autry (Gene Autry)", "Champion (Champion, Gene's horse)", "Patricia Barry (Helen Carter (as Patricia White))", "Jimmy Lloyd (Forester Joe Lucas)", "Douglass Dumbrille (Henry Mitchell)", "Damian O'Flynn (Henchman Bill Wright)", "Clayton Moore (Henchman Pete)", "Leon Weaver (Abner Weaver)", "Harry Cheshire (Dr. Daniel Chadwick)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
