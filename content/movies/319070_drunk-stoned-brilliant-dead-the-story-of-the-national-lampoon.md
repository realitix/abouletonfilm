A humour empire like no other, the impact of the magazines irreverent, often shocking, sensibility was nothing short of seismic: this is an institution whose (drunk stoned brilliant) alumni left their fingerprints all over popular culture. Both insanely great and breathtakingly innovative, The National Lampoon created the foundation of modern comic sensibility by setting the bar in comedy impossibly high.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t7fqemeHtEaxG0Ry0bTox4spBY0.jpg", "actors": ["John Belushi (Himself / Actor (archive footage))", "John Candy (Himself / Actor (archive footage))", "Chevy Chase (Himself / Actor)", "Bill Murray (Himself / Actor)", "Gilda Radner (Herself / Actrice (archive footage))", "John Goodman (Himself / Actor)", "Beverly D'Angelo (Herself / Actress)", "Kevin Bacon (Himself / Actor)", "Richard Belzer (Himself / Actor / Producer)", "Christopher Guest (Himself / Actor)", "Fred Gwynne (Himself / Actor (archive footage))", "John Hughes (Himself / Writer (archive footage))", "John Landis (Himself / Film Director)", "Tim Matheson (Himself / Actor / Director / Producer)", "Meat Loaf (Himself (archive footage))", "Billy Bob Thornton (Himself / Actor / Director)", "Richard Nixon (Himself / Former President USA (archive footage))", "John Lennon (Himself (archive footage))", "Yoko Ono (Herself (archive footage))", "Stevie Wonder (Himself (archive footage))", "George Plimpton (Himself / Actor (archive footage))", "Judd Apatow (Himself / Director / Producer)", "Harold Ramis (Himself / Film Director (archive footage))", "Ivan Reitman (Himself / Film Director)", "Danny Abelson (Himself / Lampoon Contributer)", "Tony Hendra (Himself)", "Douglas Kenney (Himself (Archival Footage))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [253265, 381041, 303835, 324264], "youtube_key": "mfOiDeMpFYk"}
