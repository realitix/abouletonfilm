To many it is the most scenic line in Britain. From Inverness to Dingwall we travel alongside the Beauly Firth and witness some of the last remaining Highland Railway semaphores still in operation at the time but long-since abolished. How many people realise that there was once a signal box at Lentran? We actually filmed inside it and recorded the sound in stereo.  At Dingwall we turn due west for the Highlands proper and traverse the summits at Raven Rock, Corriemoillie and Luib (the highest at 646ft) and stations such as Garve, Achnasheen and Strathcarron set amidst the beautiful Highland scenery.  Finally, the most spectacular section, Stromeferry to Kyle of Lochalsh along the shores of Loch Carron.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tGigvvP1Opslp8yakjuOe68q5kI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
