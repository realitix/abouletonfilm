The show sees Billy Idol, with trademark sneer and peroxide hair very much to the fore, reunited with guitarist Steve Stevens, who played on (&amp; sometimes co-wrote) all his 1980s hits. The tracklist runs from early Generation X favorites, through his classic solo singles and up to tracks from his most recent album, \"The Devil\u2019s Playground\". Idol is a fantastic live performer who oozes onstage charisma and the audience rocks along to every minute of this mesmerizing concert. Lineup: Billy Idol (vocals); Steve Stevens (guitars); Brian Tichy (drums); Stephen McGrath (bass); Derek Sherinian (keyboards).  Billy Idol delivers a dozen of his most popular tunes during the course of this Chicago concert. The setlist includes favorites such as \"Dancing With Myself,\" \"White Wedding,\" and \"Rebel Yell.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vzktjik01We8XeZ5KeQ8OPlIj0P.jpg", "actors": ["Billy Idol (Himself)", "Steve Stevens (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "DyAlMU4cmtw"}
