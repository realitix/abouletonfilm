Holbrook adapted Twain's own words for a commentary on slavery, religion and politics, mixing the satire with comic yarns about life on the Mississippi and a very effective ghost story. The show's highlight are the lengthy passages from \"Huckleberry Finn\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tCjmVbuuCH0UsXDTOaYKFtJXYjY.jpg", "actors": ["Hal Holbrook (Mark Twain (Samuel Langhorne Clemens))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
