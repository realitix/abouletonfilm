A beatnik coffee house owner is impressed and signs them up to entertain at his swinging club. Doc stages concerts for the talented but pain-ridden pooch. Doc, at the piano, rehearses Champ with great success, making several teenage cats swoon. Opening night at \"The Hungry Me\" pad is also a great success- their act creating enthuasiastic finger-snapping by the beatniks. The two become famous as Champ does a great beat presentation after Doc's piano intro and after being hit on the foot!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qY2rIixXMr0hUOEKCNNjxXb01hT.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Frees (Doc (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
