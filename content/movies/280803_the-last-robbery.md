Meanwhile, a cop is searching for a means to bring down said gangster, who has always eluded arrest. The gangster's beautiful girlfriend, who's become a junkie under the gangster's nefarious influence, is smitten with the cop -- unaware of his profession and true motive for befriending her. Then there's a bunch of street fighting, some knives and guns, a guy who climbs over the edge of a high-rise, the same guy hanging out of the window of a speeding bus who then jumps from the bus to some hot chick's Jag, lots of striped clothing, and a red and black Toyota Celica.  The film was later dubbed in English and released by Champion International Films Co LTD as \"Billion Killers\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rij63lWP6SXXnebrFnh02Tx6Mq2.jpg", "actors": ["Yodchai Meksuwan ()", "Wandee Sritrang ()", "Darm Dasakorn ()", "Kom Akkadej (Som Kit) ()", "Runglawan Sripatimakul ()", "Dome Singmoree ()", "Naiyana Shewanan ((\"Nai Yen Ne\" in Hong Kong Release))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
