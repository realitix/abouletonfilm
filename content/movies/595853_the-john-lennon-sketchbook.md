Given her penchant for the intersection of art and philosophy, Lennon\u2019s own quirky illustrations, and the odd fact that the couple\u2019s love began in visual poetry long before they met, it was the perfect medium for commemoration.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u5GoCbPZ3nLt35V32aVMyHl06RJ.jpg", "actors": ["John Lennon (himself)", "Yoko Ono (herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
