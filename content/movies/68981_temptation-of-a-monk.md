The crown prince is murdered by one of his brothers who then becomes emperor. Shi retreats to a monastery, perhaps to hide, perhaps to plan a coup. When his loyal troops as well as the princess he desires are slain, he seeks refuge in a remote, abandoned monastery where an aged abbot schools him with practical, earthy teachings. The emperor's forces pursue Shi: first a woman, then a general seek to overpower him with lust and might. Over the course of the film, the reds of battle give way to blues of meditation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/79837tDUjBbDfwl7K7atVTb9Xi.jpg", "actors": ["Joan Chen (Princess Hong-e - Scarlet / Qing-shou - Violet)", "Hsing-kuo Wu (General Shi Yan-sheng / Jing-yi)", "Zhang Fengyi (General Huo Da)", "Michael Lee (The Abbot)", "Lisa Lu (Shi's Mother)", "Teddy Robin (Soldier)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
