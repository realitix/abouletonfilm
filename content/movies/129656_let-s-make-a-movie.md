In a subconscious effort to turn her life around, she decides to make a movie with a rag-tag group of friends. The only problem is the movie is impossible for her to film without a $100 million budget, and her cast and crew are neurotic and inexperienced, to say the least. Will Cassie prevail and finish her movie, or will this become another mark on her long list of failures?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yTuDsBgK9M7SG2g2gc03bsA7dpq.jpg", "actors": ["Hallie York (Cassie Thompson)", "Johnathan Fernandez (Gary)", "Brian Cheng (Eugene)", "Eric James Eastman (Kal)", "Jessica Coles (Arielle)", "Jake Kropac (Tom)", "Elise Rovinsky (Alice)", "Ed Ryan (Steve)", "Marcus Slabine (Arnold the Homeless Guy)", "Luke Guldan (Terry)", "Elana A.
