Stuart Blackton was intrigued by the idea of a film about the history of the movies as early as 1915. He finally released a 52-minute feature called The Film Parade that was shown in New York and favorably reviewed by \"Variety\" in 1933. He continued tinkering with the film for the rest of the decade, and later filmmakers and distributors used Blackton's footage for stock or to produce their own variously titled and truncated versions.  -UCLA Film & Television Archive", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Kent Stevenson (Narrator)", "Charlie Chaplin (Himself (film clip from 'The Champion' (1915)) (archive footage) (as Charlie Chaplin))", "Marlene Dietrich (Herself (film clip from 'Der Blaue Engel\") (archive footage))", "Tom Mix (Himself (film clip from 'The Stagecoach' Guard (1915)) (archive footage))", "Gilbert M.
