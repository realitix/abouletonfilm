Meanwhile Buffalo Bill is busy torturing Brenda who turns out to be so masochistic that she loves every kinky minute of it. Will Agent Crawford ever get in Clarice's pants? Or will she stay a die-hard lesbian? Orona's captured the dark sinister cinematic nature of the original with a perverted twist around every corner.
