When I told this story to my friend Lauren who lives in New York,\r she was surprised and told me she had just been to psychic therapy to try to get a bad romance off her mind.\r We started to talk about love which we lost and the possibilities of new love.\r Sometimes you have to rely on things you can\u2019t see in life, like the power of the psychic.  This video is about the tension between real and illusionary life,\r irremediable sadness and women dealing with difficulty.\r The actress in the film is Lauren mixed with her interoperation of my mother\u2019s story.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vv6EBTTOg5S3iWxVNimYQ7pmx2S.jpg", "actors": ["Lauren Lavercombe ()", "Madeleine Stack ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
