The rebellious spirit of Mandelstam's poetry sounded a challenge to the authorities, and their author was destroyed by a state machine - he died in a transit camp. Much of what he wrote could not have been preserved had it not been for her husband Nadezhda, who taught his works by heart, copied manually-in anticipation of times when they could be published.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4o3QXdIIVjiXRbU0FTzXs7gcoXa.jpg", "actors": ["Viktor Sukhorukov ((voice))", "Miriam Sekhon ((voice))", "Inna Churikova ((voice))", "Chulpan Khamatova ((voice))", "Aleksandr Feklistov ((voice))", "Evgeniy Steblov ((voice))", "Danil Shcheblanov ((voice))", "Vladimir Mishukov ((voice))", "Kirill Pirogov ((voice))", "Serafima Ogareva ((voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
