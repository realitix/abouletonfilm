Now the concert is finally available on DVD.  Twelve songs including classics like Oh, happy day and songs from her album like Save the children but also Fr\u00e4mling, Mitt i ett \u00e4ventyr and F\u00e5ngad av en stormvind are included in a medley. Obviously all three get a nice gospel frosting. Here's Anybody here. There's no doubt gospel where this girl puts her heart to and belts the songs out like there's no tomorrow.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2RE2db28M2d2owaastIHwo2yw6f.jpg", "actors": ["Carola H\u00e4ggkvist (Herself)", "Colors of Joybells (Choir)", "Anki Sp\u00e5ngberg (Choir Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
