Pedro Viegas Barros, a researcher and linguist of indigenous languages, validated his tongue and culture. His investigations caused recognition by UNESCO as the last Chan\u00e1 speaker. Together, they embarked in an odyssey to transcend this cultural legacy with the purpose of it not to vanish as most languages around the world.
