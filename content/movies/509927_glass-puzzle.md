Mirroring each other with synchronized movements as they perform as alter-egos, Jonas and Lane reference archetypal female gestures and poses from popular and traditional cultures. Throughout the performance, space is dislocated and altered as a formal device \u2014 segmented by a swinging bar, superimposed in layers, transformed by subtle changes in light and shadow, or flattened by the video screen. With its evocative personal theater and idiosyncratic vocabulary of gestures, ritual and symbolism, Glass Puzzle is a quintessential Jonas work.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vuv0rfKfV3bB9Z7pRPxcheOTPwY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
