Filmed as a hybrid between a road-movie and a music video, the film not only illustrates the festive atmosphere of techno night clubs, but also reveals the lesser known side of this profession: weeks of track selection, lengthy travel, difficult schedule. The film suggests to reconsider the stereotype of a popular musician, to find out whether the artist is happy, to ponder what's most important to him and his audience? Shot in Switzerland, France, Hungary, Romania and Russia, the film omits the typical documentary elements: no interviews, no explanatory voice-over, no facts, no figures. The visuals and the techno music replace them, leaving the detailed interpretation to the viewer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6OKaDZOeKQM15qdnMEK2UclEaCr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
