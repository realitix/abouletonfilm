He is forty years old and lives together with his mother in a desolate block of flats. Ever since his early youth women with big breasts have fascinated him, because they symbolise a kind of earth mother to him. He has never had an especially close relationship with his own mother; she was too 'bony' for him. Object of Rene's fantasy is the actress Senta Berger, to him everything a woman should be. Standing by the blackboard and explaining the mathematical laws of sine and cosine ('sinus' is bosom in Latin), Rene sings the praises of the female curves and those of Santa Berger in particular. Filmmaker Ulrich Seidl let the former teacher speak freely about his obsessions and desires, intercutting his monologues with scenes from the protagonist's day-to-day life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jxgDXuptkVJ5bBo8rjf66Se4Kuo.jpg", "actors": ["Ren\u00e9 Rupnik (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
