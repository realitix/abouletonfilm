Then, an imaginary voyage begins from earth to the moon, on to Mars, Saturn, the closest star (besides the sun), and beyond to the edge of our universe.

It ends with philosophical musings about the significance of Earth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cdwVC18URfEdQjjxqJyRMoGDC0H.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [117591, 151490, 148624, 51929], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
