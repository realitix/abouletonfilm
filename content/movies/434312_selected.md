'Selected' is a documentary about the challenges of public urban education. Through unprecedented access in a Chicago public school, 'Selected' explores leadership, triumphs and losses in one of the most culturally and economically diverse schools in the country. 'Selected' investigates the impact of being educated in a true melting pot environment and the effect it has on education, acceptance, tolerance and a worldview. It illustrates what is possible when great leadership, diverse cultures and extraordinary minds come together.
