Gatt is murdered and the couple, married, run off to India. Old friend John Beetham sympathizes with the bride who sees that her hubby is a liar and drunk. John and Lois fly to San Francisco. Eric shows up and tries to kill John, but Scotland Yard's Lt. Charlie Chan intervenes. Chan fans may be disappointed in this globe-trotting mystery, however, as the detective (played by Korean actor E.L. Park) only appears in a few scenes.The film is more noteworthy for its introduction of Boris Karloff to sound features, in a small role as a servant from Sudan who mutters inscrutable nonsense about the whims of the desert.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tAjJqchhpZ75fMGy4628vBfq88u.jpg", "actors": ["Warner Baxter (Col John Beetham)", "Lois Moran (Eve Mannering Durand)", "E.L.
