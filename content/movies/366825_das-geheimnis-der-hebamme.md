But the time she lives in is marked by superstition and godliness. When Marthe can not help the burgrave's wife from her village, the girl has to flee. Your path crosses that of Ritter Christian, who moves eastward into the Mark Meissen with a group of Frankish settlers. In the Middle Ages an unimaginably long and arduous way. Christian has a hard time avoiding the fascination of Marthe, but their diverse backgrounds make a relationship impossible and the settlers are afraid of the weird girl.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8QGxLqsP7DBqwhGMA9rEkNsjnVE.jpg", "actors": ["Ruby O.
