In Blood and Oil, bestselling author and Nation magazine defense correspondent Michael T. Klare challenges this conventional wisdom and corrects the historical record. The film unearths declassified documents and highlights forgotten passages in prominent presidential doctrines to show how concerns about oil have been at the core of American foreign policy for more than 60 years -- rendering our contemporary energy and military policies virtually indistinguishable. In the end, Blood and Oil calls for a radical re-thinking of US energy policy, warning that unless we change direction, we stand to be drawn into one oil war after another as the global hunt for diminishing world petroleum supplies accelerates.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8utOnTzVhcfbd7wfOSrvlkoabDK.jpg", "actors": ["Ronald Reagan (Himself)", "Osama Bin Laden (Himself)", "George H.
