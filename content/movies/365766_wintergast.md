Ever since, Keller has been in a creative crisis. Although he already filled 2000 pages with notes for his first feature film, the rough draft is far from finished. Much to the disappointment of his girlfriend Christina whose biological clock is ticking. Now, living in a basement room and in financial distress, Keller takes on a job as an anonymous tester of youth hostels.
