At the age of 21, Italian composer Giacchino Rossini penned the masterful comic opera L'ITALIANA IN ALGERI (The Italian Girl in Algiers) in less than a month. The composer's youthful exuberance comes across in this infectious 1987 performance. Though she's known mainly for her Wagner roles, acclaimed German mezzo-soprano Doris Soffel shines in the title role of Isabella. Ralf Weikert conducts, and Mauro Pagano oversees sets and costumes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qdYVAnEKzHRB4F6I2vzWy7OOyjM.jpg", "actors": ["Doris Soffel  (Isabella)", "Robert Gambill (Lindoro)", "G\u00fcnter von Kannen (Mustaf\u00e0)", "Enric Serra (Taddeo)", "Nuccia Focile (Elvira)", "Susan Maclean (Zulma)", "Rudolf Hartmann (Haly)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
