Her parents are informed that only a blood transfusion will save her life, but her religious fundamentalist father, John Harris (Michael Craig), ignores the doctors advice and forbids the procedure, believing that God will inexplicably heal his daughter. His embittered wife, Pat (Janet Munro), who has tolerated her husband's religious convictions throughout their marriage finally relents and signs the required papers, but sadly too late and their daughter dies. The angry Dr. Brown Brown, (Patrick McGoohan), decides to press ahead with manslaughter charges against Harris and the case quickly comes to the law courts. After a lengthy and emotional trial, Harris is eventually acquitted. Though a free man, he must come to terms with his own conflicting feelings over his faith and his daughter\u2019s death.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ioVQSee0giRiclkwrOMmYgBN16c.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Craig (John Harris)", "Patrick McGoohan (Dr Brown)", "Janet Munro (Pat Harris)", "Paul Rogers (Hart Jacobs)", "Malcolm Keen (Mr Harris Sr)", "Megs Jenkins (Mrs Gordon)", "Michael Bryant (John's Counsel)", "Leslie Sands (Clyde)", "Norman Wooland (Counsel for the Crown)", "John Barrie (Mr Gordon)", "Walter Hudd (Judge)", "Michael Aldridge (Harvard)", "Basil Dignam (Mapleton)", "Maureen Pryor (Teddy's Mother)", "Kenneth J.
