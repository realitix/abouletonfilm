Several songs were recorded especially for the film by bands like Nerf Herder, No Motiv, and the Vandals, while much of the material recorded by the label's own roster is exclusive to the soundtrack or at least previously unissued. Plus, there are a few cuts licensed from bands like Pennywise, Rancid, and Lagwagon.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iTW8Ex5xSVO92JiTgib3eoTLvuY.jpg", "actors": ["Joe Escalante (Dirk Castigo)", "Mia Crowe (Claire Won)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
