Everything seems to be going just fine. Until, that is, when Father (Mother\u2019s first husband) returns from Japan and decides Mother\u2019s upbringing of his daughter has been amoral influence, and decides to obtain legal custody of his daughter. Not having seen her father since a child, his daughter objects. (Why break up a good thing at home?) She decides to \u2019lay\u2019 a trap for her father. Posing as a girl out for a fun time, she and her girlfriend (for whom she has the hots) pick up her father, and the \u2018fun\u2019 begins. At the last moment they both leave father \u2018high and dry.\u2019 Not until later, when they meet again, does father realize that his unhappy incident with the \u2018fun girls\u2019 was in fact with his daughter whom he is attempting to gain custody of. Knowing this, he decides his efforts are futile for they are truly \u201cLike Mother, Like Daughter.\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/koqeEexAn3sWCVskuc4WN449Ajx.jpg", "actors": ["Kecia Kane (Tricia)", "Leila Harris (Wanda)", "David Fine (Duane)", "Nancy Franklin (Pam)", "Nancy Keller (Kathy)", "Michael Muir (Frank)", "Marsha Cossel (Louise)", "Jamie Gillis (Marty (credited as Ronny Morgan))", "Guy Thomas (Bruce - father (credited Ralph Carl))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
