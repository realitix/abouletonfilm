Levy, \u201cPiranha\u201d chronicles events when genetically-enhanced piranha are accidently released into a river system in the wilderness north of Los Angeles, which threaten kids & counselors at a Summer Camp and vacationers at a lake resort. A private investigator (Alexandra Paul) and a lonely environmentalist (William Katt) team-up to save the swimmers.\r\n\r\nThis is virtually a scene-by-scene recreation of the 1978 film, taking place in Southern Cal rather than the heart of Texas. While \"Piranha\" (both versions) is sort of a \"Jaws\" (1975) knockoff, it\u2019s different enough to not be a rip-off:  The story takes place in a river system deep in the mainland and not the ocean; the \u2018monster\u2019 consists of teams of little vicious fish rather than a huge great white shark; the beach sequences involve quaint campground-like beaches rather than major ocean beaches; unlike \u201cJaws,\u201d there\u2019s a focus on alluring young women, although \u201cJaws 2\u201d (1978) delivered the goods in this area as well; and there\u2019s more of a sense of adventure and arguably suspense. The tone of the original version of \u201cPiranha\u201d mixed-in amusing elements with the horrific mayhem, but this version shoots for a more austere air.\r\n\r\nAs my title blurb points out, this 1995 version is all-around inferior to the 1978 rendition, even though it\u2019s basically the same exact story and both were produced by Roger Corman. Some of the changes, aside from cast and locations, include: A woman (Darleen Carr) is substituted for the scientist (Kevin McCarthy) at the research facility; the stop-motion mini-dinosaur featured in the first act is omitted; there\u2019s a new wannabe director character; one of the two babes at the camp dies prematurely; and the filmmakers were more conscious of including racial diversity in the background.\r\n\r\nThe new locations with sparser foliage are also inferior, as are the women. Although voluptuous Lorissa McComas as Barbara in the prologue is just as good as (or better than) Janie Squire in the original, Soleil Moon Frye and Kehli O'Byrne are rather second rate compared to cutie Melody Thomas Scott and curvy Belinda Balaski, although Kehli is certainly a striking woman.\r\n\r\nI suggest skipping this one and viewing the original instead, unless you\u2019re a fan of some of the cast members or want to compare the two versions. The 1978 film is superior on practically every level.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 89 minutes and was shot, in part, at Castaic Lake just north of Valencia/Santa Clarita, California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C-"}], "recommandations_id": [231082, 39862, 223732, 195796]}
