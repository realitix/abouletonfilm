For example, while the word \"hot\" might describe an attractive girl at other places of higher education, at Kirenji it's more likely to mean \"hot blooded,\" \"hot tempered,\" and \"ready for red hot action\" - as in physical combat, that is!  When 17-year-old Maki enrolls, thinking she's the baddest bad girl of them all, she quickly learns the hard way that at Kirenji she'll have to punch her way to the top of the shapely power pyramid... and it's just too bad that the equally intimidating Natsumu is standing in her path!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/70Q9vlglBFaV0SRFrArsdLc5FIZ.jpg", "actors": ["Natsumu Kinami ()", "Maho Rukawa ()", "Maki Ryo ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
