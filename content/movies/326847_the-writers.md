After Andrew (Todd Michael Smith), a married writer, is kidnapped by Eddy (Steven Michael McKenzie), a seductive and surprisingly forthcoming serial killer, he is compelled to write about him and the two begin a strange sexual relationship. The actors hold absolutely nothing back from the camera. McKenzie and Smith offer full-frontal nudity and graphic scenes of unsimulated sex - with some sinister kink and a little bloodshed thrown in for good, horrific measure (the blood is fake, of course)!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/44IT3q30DaLf37B1O6gPGBXWDGb.jpg", "actors": ["Ben Kacon (Dawson the Publisher)", "Steven Michael McKenzie (Eddy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
