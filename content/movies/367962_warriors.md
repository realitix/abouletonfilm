In a community deep with tradition, where female genital mutilation (FGM) is still a rite of passage, these young Maasai express their frustrations at inequality by smacking cricket balls on the plains of Kenya and dreaming of life beyond their own village. Thus begins a journey all the way to England; the home of cricket. It is a journey which gives the Warriors the courage to face their elders in the hope of ending FGM.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hB2aarW2unO4ARh2ByaCP4QTpgR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "T9Jvig8k8j0"}
