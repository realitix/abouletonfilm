With little information on how 1 Para Brigade's battle went the day before or what faced them on the ground the stage was set for an epic battle. John Waddy, v company commander in 156 Para Battalion and a team of  Arnhem experts cover the ground where 4 Para Brigade fought  with 9 SS Pz Div in the woods to the west of Arnhem in what was to be an unequal but heroic battle; the result of a flawed concept and plan.Driven back  the Brigade was withdrawing across LZ  P when the Polish heavy lift  gliders swept in to cause.
