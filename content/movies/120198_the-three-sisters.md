But for now they exist in a malaise of dissatisfaction. Soldiers from the local military post provide them some companionship and society, but nothing can suffice to replace Moscow in their hopes. Andrei marries a provincial girl, Natasha, and begins to settle into a life of much less meaning than he had hoped. Natasha begins to run the family her way. Masha, though married, yearns for the sophisticated life and begins a dalliance with Vershinin, an army officer with a sick and suicidal wife. Even Irina, the freshest, most optimistic of the sisters, begins to waver in her dreams until, finally, tragedy strikes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d4LBGUsgt9oiNlo21xm4diTMm5W.jpg", "actors": ["Anthony Hopkins (Andrey)", "Janet Suzman (Masha)", "Eileen Atkins (Olga)", "Michele Dotrice (Irina)", "Michael Bryant (Vershinin)", "Joss Ackland (Chebutykin)", "Sarah Badel (Natasha)", "Richard Pearson (Koolyghin)", "Donald Pickering (Soliony)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
