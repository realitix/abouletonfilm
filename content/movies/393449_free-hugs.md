We follow the hilariously bitter Billie (Jaclyn Jonet) as she attempts to find catharsis through comfort food (and wine), sawing her belongings in half and attacking a particularly meaningful local monument. Ultimately Billie must slam into the harsh reality of heartbreak before she can understand that sometimes the purest form of love is a free hug from a stranger.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dcIcXmT5Ua7p2PEbXexT2c0K9Kh.jpg", "actors": ["Jaclyn Jonet (Billie)", "Sarah Burns (Sydney)", "Megalyn Echikunwoke (Megan)", "Aziz Ansari (Mike)", "Bryn Mooser (Waiter)", "Olivia Wilde (Head Hooper)", "Justin Long (Checkout Boy)", "Pollyanna Rose (Beautiful Blonde)", "Barbara Burchfield (Hot Blond Friend)", "Liz Beebe (Aerobics Instructor)", "Gabriella Redding (Hooper #1)", "Melissa Palmer (Hooper #2)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "UKvc2XzR5vw"}
