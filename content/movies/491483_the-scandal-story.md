The rumours circulated throughout the following year, but the Fourth Estate was less inclined in those days to disturb the privacy of those at the top of the tree. Eventually, the story made the papers, and Profumo made a statement to the Commons, denying impropriety over his relationship with Keeler. Three months later he was back, confessing that he had misled the House, and he resigned as an MP. But that was only the start of it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rGiv0FQjGqyN492fOtiSp1AjImK.jpg", "actors": ["Christine Keeler ()", "Muriel Gray (Narrator)", "Alfred Denning ()", "Johnny Edgecombe ()", "Robert Llewellyn ()", "Mandy Rice-Davies ()", "Stephen Ward ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
