Toby plays Harold Kunkle, king of the nerds. Harold's been pushed beyond his meek limits and now seeks bloody retribution throughout these two hilarious and horrifying shockers.  As witty as 'Revenge of the Nerds' and as violent as 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', Killer Nerd has a wide appeal among fans of horror, comedy, and cult cinema and that goes double for 'Bride of Killer Nerd!'", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f86WG6Sm9ne1T02UjePzIzNxuml.jpg", "actors": ["Toby Radloff (Harold Kunkle)", "Heidi Lohr (Sally / Thelma Crump)", "Lori Scarlett (Jenny)", "Tim Redmond (Matt)", "Lewis DeJulius (Jimbo)", "Marc Andreyko (Dave)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [113451, 41790], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
