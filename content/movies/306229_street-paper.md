This documentary offers a unique look into the lives of the founders, vendors and writers as the newspaper experiences exponential growth during September 2010. The Contributor is a member of The North American Street Newspaper Association (NASNA), which has 31 members. Addressing the issues of poverty and homelessness, a street newspaper is distributed by homeless and formerly homeless vendors. By sharing personal stories, street newspapers attach lives, faces and hearts to the idea of homelessness. These publications allow a bridge connecting the gap between the very poor and the rest of society by helping them understand the issues that concern homeless individuals. For many homeless people, this opportunity gives them a chance to get back on their feet and the real possibility of securing housing.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
