What they never are afraid to do is to do something different and tell stories that Hollywood wouldn't or if they would in a very different manner . Where Hollywood would normally sensationalize something to the max they usually play down their stories to a more humane level. The characters in their films are usually a bit odd or dysfunctional in one way or the other.\r\n\r\nAnd this is definitly on that same page, with the title you would expect something really exploitative and wild but it's really low-key and more a character study than anything else.\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna say too much because the less you know is really better here I think, but it's a interesting and different indie drama comedy."}], "recommandations_id": [265449, 187010, 368620, 45875]}
