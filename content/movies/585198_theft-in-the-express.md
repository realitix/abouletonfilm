To be opened on September 1, 1930 in the presence of my daughter Mary.\" The layer walks nervously in front of the burgled desk. He brings out a revolver and points it in his head. At this very moment the detective Chante Coq, a Lord Herbert's friend, enters the room. He undertakes to find both thief and the will. The wealthy heiress travels from France to East on the Orient Express. The international criminal carrying the envelope with inheritance papers is also in the train.
