Her deceased husband had been the mayor for years and when he died, she was left to carry on and to raise his daughter from his first marriage. She lives with the daughter, her father-in-law and a housekeeper. In the town square, there was a statue of her late husband and every year since his death, they have an anniversary celebration there. This year during a thunderstorm, the statue is hit by lightning and the head falls off. The daughter insists that a new statue be erected instead of patching the old one. Mayor Crandall is sent to New York to interview the prospective sculptor, George Corday.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1fmxMrMTzH5gLpsn7g50qPOBG1O.jpg", "actors": ["Irene Dunne (Anne Crandall)", "Charles Boyer (George Corday)", "Charles Coburn (Jonathan Crandall Sr)", "Mona Freeman (Diana Crandall)", "Jerome Courtland (Gilbert Parker)", "Elizabeth Patterson (Jessie)", "Charles Dingle (Morton Buchanan)", "Brooks Benedict (Nightclub Patron (uncredited))", "Virginia Brissac (Townswoman (uncredited))", "Bess Flowers (Woman with Man in Leonardo's (uncredited))", "Adele Jergens (Gilda LaVerne (uncredited))", "Milton Kibbee (Workman (uncredited))", "Nina Mae McKinney (Maid in Nightclub Powder Room (uncredited))", "Frank Puglia (Leonardo (uncredited))", "Virginia Sale (Secretary (uncredited))", "Shelley Winters (Young Woman Fleeing Nightclub Raid (uncredited))", "Carl Switzer (Elevator Boy (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
