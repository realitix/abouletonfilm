This is Stalin's pyramid, his immortality. We visit people who have lived there for 50 years, see their flats (some modernized, others decaying), and listen to their histories: the son of a KGB man, a retired rocket scientist, a sculptor's son. an actor, seamstresses at a uniform shop, an ex-pat, and two artists. We see a kindergarten and remember marching; we watch parades and discuss surveillance. The commentary is wry: Putin emerges as Stalin's heir.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4ZrS4wm31DuQHRw5jHPbPFuKaLu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
