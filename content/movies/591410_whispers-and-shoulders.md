WHISPERS AND SHOULDERS appropriates and reworks the raw footage of JOOJ's 'Shoulders and Whispers' music video. The video's images are rendered voiceless, with figures adrift in suspended animation for a twenty-six minute hypno-poetic reconstruction that draws upon unused images from the original music video. The initial video, 'Shoulders and Whispers,' is a black-and-white three-minute pop-song artifact designed to grab attention with each shot a fixed duration with a slow left-to-right pan. No shot is ever repeated. It has a forward momentum, unfolding new dynamics and imagery; conversely, WHISPERS AND SHOULDERS embraces repetitiveness in richly-saturated colour.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Sook-Yin Lee (Specter)", "Adam Litovitz (Witness)", "Syreeta Hector (Angel)", "Mairi Greig (Angel)", "Chester Brown (Father Time)", "Benjamin Kamino (Twin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
