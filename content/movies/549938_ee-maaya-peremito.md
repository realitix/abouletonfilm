Except for the interval bang, rest of the scenes in the first half look forced. The basic emotion which was required in the second half was missing completely. Many scenes look artificial and do not elevate the proceedings at all.\r\n\r\nJust to create some emotions, the director added many unnecessary scenes which were not required at all. The basic romance which is required in films like these is missing out in major part. The chemistry between the lead pair also takes a beating after a point of time in the film. Apart from this, all the scenes in this love and family drama are routine and quite predictable"}], "recommandations_id": []}
