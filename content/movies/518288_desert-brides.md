Living in the Negev desert in Israel, the story is told through the eyes of a wedding photographer, Mariam Al-Quader. She herself is living under constant fear that her husband will marry \"over her\" (the expression used when a man chooses an additional wife). The other two women are pushed into marrying already married men, and become \"second wives\", forced to cooperate within a structure they despise or are afraid of. \\par \\par \\par The family tragedies presented in this film highlight the strength and survival of the social structures and their injustices, leaning usually on the victims' reluctant cooperation.
