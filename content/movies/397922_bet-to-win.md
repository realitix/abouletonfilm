He tells you the best you must have and more importantly the bests not to have and after 30 years in the game, who knows more than 'The Belly from the Telly'?!  Sometimes it's fun then sad as TV's Robert Cooper asks Gary about how he lost over a million pounds on one race! Yes, this DVD tells the truth but it's a must buy if you have the occasional flutter.  You won't get this knowledge anywhere else other than this hour long DVD.  If Gary could educate ten per cent of the punters to beat the bookies he'll be happy and believe me, after watching this DVD you'll be on your way.  So in Gary's own words ...BE LUCKY!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jHVVake7EapJw5evO7YXijxwMCh.jpg", "actors": ["Gary Wiltshire ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
