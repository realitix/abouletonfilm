Sure, several of the youths are mostly annoying at first, but it\u2019s so exaggerated it\u2019s obviously camp; plus their arses are all humbled in good time, BIG TIME. Moreover, the three girls are appealing in a girl-next-door type of way despite their initial obnoxiousness, particularly Amber Marie Bollinger as Jessica and Ashley Watkins as Jenny (while blonde Sarah Zurell ain\u2019t nothing to sneeze at). The Irish bloke is easily the most irksome male, but he\u2019s willing to boldly sacrifice everything to save one of the girls. That's not just likable, but noble and heroic!\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, unlike \"Wrong Turn,\" the movie mixes-in comedy and parody reminiscent of 2007's \"Wrong Turn 2: Dead End,\u201d but some people apparently didn\u2019t get the memo. In any case, while nothing great, \"Pelt\" is worth catching if you like backwoods slasher flicks. I actually like it better than \"Wrong Turn\" (it has far better women) and it's close to being on par with \"Wrong Turn 2.\" Not to mention, Amber Marie Bollinger (Jessica) scampering around the woods in flimsy attire is worth the price of admission.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 87 minutes and was shot in Northern California, which is a weak stand-in for Kentucky because anyone who's been to Kentucky knows it doesn't look like Northern California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"}], "recommandations_id": [78369, 101791, 251733, 30385]}
