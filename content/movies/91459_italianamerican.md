Scorsese's parents relate detailed accounts of being Sicilian immigrants in New York City, their family lives, and \"the old country\" after the war. This is a very talking heads-ish doc with numerous still photos and a bit of footage interspersed in it. However, Catherine has a lot of personality, whereas Charles takes awhile to open up to the camera(s?). Oh, Catherine shows us how to make meatballs, and if the viewer needs more info, a complete recipe is given at the end of the film's credits!\r\n\r\nThis is really necessary viewing for any fan of Scorsese's. It's available to watch at Youtube."}], "recommandations_id": [173510, 110901, 110903, 33470], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
