{"tmdb_id": 361186, "title": "The Pittsburgh Drug Trials", "original_title": "The Pittsburgh Drug Trials", "slug_title": "the-pittsburgh-drug-trials", "date": "2015-09-23", "genre": ["Documentaire"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "Pittsburgh was the center of the sports world in 1979, home to the Super Bowl champion Steelers and the World Series champion Pirates. The Pirates and their rallying cry of \u201cWe Are Family\u201d brought a renewed sense of pride to the city. But as it turned out, the family was dangerously dysfunctional, with many members succumbing to the temptation of cocaine and dragging baseball into a nationwide scandal. This film revisits that era and paints a picture of how, by 1985, easy drugs and fast nights brought the national pastime from the diamond to a federal courtroom.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8UWEfRdDyjX8jK0meVtCjQPgiI0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
