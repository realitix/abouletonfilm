This was the film that Pialat himself claimed was the most complete realization of what he was aiming for with his Turkish documentaries. It's not difficult to see why this was his favorite: here he abandons the historical commentary and documentary observation of the other shorts in favor of an emotional emphasis on the lives of the poor and the unemployed.A short doc by Maurice Pialat.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p8clcro5FnoK7UdQgdzcSpIphH1.jpg", "actors": ["Andr\u00e9 Reybaz (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
