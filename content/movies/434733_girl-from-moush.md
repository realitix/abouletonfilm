It is not an Armenia based in a reality but one, which appears, like the mythical city of Shangri-La, when ones eyes are closed. A mesh of traditional images 'engraved' in film, with haunting voice-over, and rich colors, music and rhythms that continues long after the film is over. The viewers are engaged and forced through unchartered landscapes of uncertainty and fascination.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yuS0BhAXZvMbR8Gs0f77Ql3abVE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
