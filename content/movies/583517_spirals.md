Raw film was spooled onto a spiral and partially submerged in developer, so that only half the film is developed, leaving the trace of a time spiral in the image and (optical) sound. The film can be projected in either direction. Outwards, from the centre of the spiral, we hear a decelerating sound like someone regaining their breath.\r G.S.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zAQZ8vlBZv3d1avLVqvQnCkt0ca.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
