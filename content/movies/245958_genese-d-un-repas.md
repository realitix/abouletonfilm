Moullet begins with these on his plate but constructs his film by working backwards and finding the sources for these items and how they reach our plates. As Moullet\u2019s investigation deepens, however, the film moves beyond the confines of a simple exploration of food origins into more political and social realms, not only relating to food but also to the medium of film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rzRHLIooyfLV7AJMk3hMabos2fS.jpg", "actors": ["Luc Moullet ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
