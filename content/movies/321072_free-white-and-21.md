The film alternates between Pindell recounting her stories and a caricature of a young white woman who rebukes Pindell for her ungrateful and paranoid statements. In criticizing the expectations and stereotypes imposed on a female, black artist, Pindell\u2019s work can also been seen as a contribution to a feminist debate. Though Pindell\u2019s body of work mostly consists of painting that explores texture, colour and structures, this video work stands out as being a seminal work in her career. Free, White and 21 can be found in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jEFIGkmiL73WRFIeCjzkSbvc0wH.jpg", "actors": ["Howardena Pindell ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
