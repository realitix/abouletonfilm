Viewers will recognize Sanders from All About Eve, again playing the older, wiser, mentor. A lot of time is spent with the viewer (but not the characters in the film) watching and hearing what is going on inside the foreign embassies and administration offices, so it's very much a cold war us- against- them story, with Race trying to get to the truth. Caught up in all this is fellow reporter Marta Toren as Jeanne Moray, and no-one is really sure what her story is.... We are led to think she is more involved than we know, but that part of the story seems to have been dropped, or deleted.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5N3wG9U42ChaurEjuwMQvNAc7ks.jpg", "actors": ["Dana Andrews (Jimmy Race)", "George Sanders (Nicholas Strang)", "Audrey Totter (Sandy Tate)", "M\u00e4rta Tor\u00e9n (Jeanne Moray)", "Sandro Giglio (Gabor Czeki, alias Grisha)", "Donald Randolph (Anton Borvitch)", "Herbert Berghof (Prime Minister Andreas Ordy)", "Ben Astar (Minister of Justice Vajos)", "Willis Bouchey (Biddle, an Editor)", "Earl Lee (Dad Pelham)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
