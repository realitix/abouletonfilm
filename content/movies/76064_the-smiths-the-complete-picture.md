These alternate with five rock videos, two directed by Derek Jarman (Panic and Ask), two by Tim Broad (Girlfriend in a Coma and Stop Me...), and one by Paula Grief and Richard Levine (How Soon Is Now?). It concludes with Jarman's short film, \"The Queen Is Dead,\" with a three-song soundtrack. The rock videos, particularly Jarman's, are filled with multiple and superimposed images, changing tints, and little narrative coherence; they get their pace from the music's rhythm. Androgyny, dancing children, belching smokestacks, graffiti, angry young men, a waif in a cap: collages of modern alienation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cMILzJqjHZVOXT08f7k2KpWtoMD.jpg", "actors": ["Morrissey (himself)", "Johnny Marr (himself)", "Andy Rourke (himself)", "Mike Joyce (himself)", "Dale Hibbert (himself)", "Craig Gannon (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
