Filmed over several years of two UFO buffs on their own personal search for the truth, 'Alien Highway' is about the people whose passionate obsession created a unique cultural phenomenon that flourished for a time in an obscure little community that happens to exist on the border of America's Twilight Zone.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tgwspdtGSJnGkbRuwrjmvlNY0s8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "NZGfL2-qOEc"}
