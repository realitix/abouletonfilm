We're in Langhe, a unique territory, universally recognized as one of the most beautiful places in Italy, fresh candidate for Unesco World Heritage  but afflicted by uncontrolled economic development, urbanization, overbuilding, abandonment of the less profitable areas.  Those of Maria Theresa, Silvio and Mauro are stories of people who have insight into a future they do not like and have chosen to refuse it.  Their challenges are still open, they're not yet fully met and perhaps they never will: these heretics move in one direction, while the world moves in another, quite the opposite one.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6fZJDGCLCC6G8sWlQDLjuGdsv9R.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
