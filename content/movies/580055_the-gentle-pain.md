For it became epic in just about every sense of the word: the film is very long; it tells a multi-layered story characterised as much by its digressions as by its main narrative thread, which concerns a filmmaker\u2019s attempts to make sense of the life of Thorkild Hansen, a Danish traveller/historian/writer internationally probably best known for his non-fiction novel Processen mod Hamsun (1978); and it took a long time to finish \u2013 and then sat on a shelf due to legal battles galore.  What is now finally revealed is a monument of modern(ist) cinema: a work that as much charts one man\u2019s journey into his soul as a voyage of discovery into another artist\u2019s mind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iT5F45XFOcH7GEVadExMbipvefU.jpg", "actors": ["Ewa Fr\u00f6ling ()", "Caspar Phillipson ()", "Laure Calamy ()", "Kasper Leisner ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
