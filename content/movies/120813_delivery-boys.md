Some work as pizza delivery boys, hence they call themselves the \"Delivery Boys\". They form a dance team and enter a local break dance contest, sponsored by a woman's panty manufacturer. A rival gang's sponsor intimidates their employer into thinking she must keep the boys working so they won't be harmed. She gives the boys some \"specialized\" deliveries to make them late for the contest. The antics and calamities abound as the boys wrestle with her work assignments and getting to the contest on time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/chBc3lxt43PbsJkyBGJnh37JGRB.jpg", "actors": ["Josh Marcano (Max)", "Tom Sierchio (Joey)", "Jim Soriero (Conrad)", "Nelson Vasquez (Izzie)", "Yayo Gonz\u00e1lez (Scandal)", "Sammy Luquis (Sike)", "Mario Van Peebles (Spider)", "Lisa Vidal (Tina)", "Kelly Nichols (Elizabeth)", "Craig Horrall (Young Intern)", "Taija Rae (Nurse)", "Veronica Hart (Art Snob)", "Scott Baker (Art Snob)", "Samantha Fox (Woman in Tuxedo)", "Annabelle Gurwitch (Woman with Big Hat)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
