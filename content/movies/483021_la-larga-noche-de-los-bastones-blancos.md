Upon arrival, he stays with an old friend of the family, Rogelio Molinos, who lives with his daughter Marisol. Soon between the two young people a relationship is established that makes Andr\u00e9s conceive false illusions. At the same time, the young blind man meets in a tavern with another blind man, this one by birth, and among them is born a deep friendship that will culminate in being locked in a subway car that goes, out of service, to deserted garages.
