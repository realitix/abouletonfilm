Two twin brothers are walking down the road carrying a pail of water, they fight and come to blows, and a bemused older man intervenes and sets them back on their way. It's that simple and it's that lovely.  A graduate of the Art School of Kyrghyzstan, Aktan Abdykalyko (or Abdikalikov) first worked as a set designer for Kirgisfilm. After several well-received documentaries and short films, his first feature-length fiction film, Beshkempir, won several awards including the Silver Leopard at the Locarno Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uIPfLlCSkCL3UUM1IY3eiTDaMlI.jpg", "actors": ["Hassan Zhumabekov ()", "Hussen Zhumabekov ()", "Abit Kazybekov ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
