That spring was the second time since 1990 that a group of Czech tourists set foot in the DPRK. The film follows twenty-seven Czechs who have decided to spend approximately 2,600 Euros on a sightseeing tour of a country which cultivates a cult of personality, maintains concentration camps for its citizens and doesn't hide its development of nuclear weapons. Foreign visitors are only allowed a view of a carefully prepared illusion, thoroughly supervised by \"guides\". What is more, the North Korean system is starkly reminiscent of our own past. Which emotions do our travellers experience: sympathy, nostalgia or, in contrast, happiness that \"we already have this behind us\"? How does a Czech person, after being accustomed to eighteen years of freedom and democracy, come to terms with the directives and restrictions of a totalitarian system?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9f24EiVcGDUkABhLudX10TyDlJ4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [65896], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
