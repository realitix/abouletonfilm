The pair that played the married couple in the film were actually married in real life, and the actor who played the evil Japanese mad scientist was born, like me, Canadian. This would have scored higher for me had the mutation not given Larry a second head--they needn't have overdone it there. This was made very suspenseful, with nourish undertones, and it was a greatly enjoyable alternate take on the Jekyll and Hyde story, complete with allusions to: a) The power of alcohol in transforming one's personality and morality; b) how difficult it is in one's life to be faithful and monogamous, when life has more than its share of temptations.; and c) The power of both unconditional love in both friends and one's spouse.\r\n\r\nThis certainly deserves a better rating than it tends to get in cinephilic circles, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to any fans of the genre."}], "recommandations_id": [3125, 122027, 84719, 29412], "youtube_key": "Ev_DeeuQbuo"}
