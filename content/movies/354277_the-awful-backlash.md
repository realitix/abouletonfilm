Any further evidence of the title\u2019s confusing \u2018awfulness\u2019 \u2013 other than the literal disentanglement of the line remains, however, tentative, left as it were, literally, at a loose end. The viewer knows nothing of the incident that led to this backlash or entanglement; nor of the directors\u2019 initial motive for the title indeed not of any other attempt at blending an additional storyline beyond what is seen. There is, perhaps, one link with a reverse reaction \u2013 a sense of gradual recovery taking place, as the thread unfolds from a position of multiplicity back to a singular line.\u201d (Pamela Kember, Rethinking Refunctioning, \u2018Awful Backlash\u2019 catalogue, May 2000)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aegGn8pEoUM5lSYcwUmaZgXmWJd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
