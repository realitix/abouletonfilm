Flashbulbs pop as they announce they have solved the world's energy problems using seawater, batteries and a mysterious glass contraption. 'Cold Fusion' is born. Within days, Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann are on the cover of Time Magazine. But three short months later, their careers in tatters and their reputations ruined, they flee the US as Cold Fusion becomes synonymous with 'bad science.' Twenty-two years later, despite continued disdain from mainstream science, a group of scientists, entrepreneurs and one high school student are confident that Cold Fusion will save the world, and that we're closer than ever to the Holy Grail of civilization. They're The Believers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vohUXW9AVKgHD9pCdM20VmQ1zEw.jpg", "actors": ["Kevin Ashley (Himself)", "Karen Ashley (Herself)", "Irving Dardik (Himself)", "Rod Decker (Himself)", "Martin Fleischmann (Himself)", "Sheila Fleischmann (Herself)", "Pam Fogle (Herself)", "Ryan Freilino (Himself)", "Thomas Gieryn (Himself)", "Eric Golab (Himself)", "Rafal Golab (Himself)", "Marvin Hawkins (Himself)", "Peter Hagelstein (Himself)", "Michael Lubell (Himself)", "James Martinez (Himself)", "Michael McKubre (Himself)", "Robert Park (Himself)", "Chase Peterson (Himself)", "Edward Storms (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
