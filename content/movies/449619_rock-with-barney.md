While there, Barney and the Backyard Gang tour the studio on their own, while producing their own show. From a cereal commercial set and a puppet show and the six little ducks and teddy bears and the US flag and an island paradise and a make up place to a jungle, the show is filmed along with many props in the studio. With the power of imagination and some movie magic, anything is possible when Barney's around.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d6dUXcEa73bLpWabZUdRtLg8zFL.jpg", "actors": ["David Joyner (Barney)", "Brian Eppes (Michael)", "Leah Gloria (Luci)", "Alexander Jhin (Adam)", "Becky Swonke (Amy)", "Jessica Zucha (Tina)", "Bob West (Barney (voice))", "Dao Knight (Baby Bop)", "Julie Johnson (Baby Bop (voice))", "Alexis Harris (Jennifer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
