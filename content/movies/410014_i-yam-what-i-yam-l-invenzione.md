In Greco's film a shipwrecked man stumbles upon an ultra-modernist mansion. In it he finds a group of people trapped in a perpetual present facilitated by a machine that's capable of reproducing reality. Sant's reinvention of this film is shot on the same location, follows the same storyline, but occupies another world. In place of the mansion, he finds himself in 'Sweethaven' - the set of Altman's 'Popeye'. Though there is no trace of Greco's set, Altman's 'Sweethaven' remains - echoing Greco's plot by existing as an open-air museum where costumed entertainers re-enact scenes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tpmC2tsAPSw4gkgQPpD3302uC7Z.jpg", "actors": ["Emanuel Cutajar (Main character)", "Ana-Maria Grosu (Olive Oyl)", "Theodore Zammit (Popeye)", "Gaetano Zauri (Bluto)", "Daniel Casingena (Popeye #2)", "Colin Magro (Village worker)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
