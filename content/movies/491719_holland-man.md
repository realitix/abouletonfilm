With experimental photography on Super 8, 16mm and digital mediums, his son Aaron Zeghers follows this life change. The dissolution of the family farm is seen both intimately but also as a microcosm of the modern industrialized world. Nature is contrasted with industrial might in this sentimental and existential portrait of one's own family.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5r8LEpe4FBXXzak5G2oTpUcPPHb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
