The new laws are enforced by the security department of the Spectrum corporation, a huge conglomerate of the five biggest companies in the world. A voyeuristic filmmaker falls in love with an underground spoken word artist. As they find themselves unable to talk to one another, they start to make small films and write letters to one another. As the poet speaks out against Spectrum, and its owners, their lives become in danger.
