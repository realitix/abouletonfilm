Against all odds, competitors from all over the globe gather for the annual World Crokinole Championship in Tavistock, Ontario. This film takes an inner look into the sport of Crokinole through the lives of four competitors. Viewers see its history and amazing popularity, and experience the stress of not only the competitors but the organizers -- organizers who wonder not only if the tournament will be a success, but if the competition will go on at all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lfVXRHlEn0ImhHHnJiBdyJtk9BD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
