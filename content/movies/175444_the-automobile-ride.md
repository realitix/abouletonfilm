He then receives a call and leaves. Koko leaves after but not before taking some money from Max's wallet that he left behind. Max arrives to his date then comes back to his office to get his wallet. After recovering it, he drives with his date to get twelve gallons of gas. Koko arrives just as the pump is going and mischievously takes the hose from the car as the hose falls to the ground unknowingly to anyone else. Just as the wasted twelve gallons are up, Koko puts it back in the car before Max retrieves it! He gets his wallet and finds his money gone so he excuses himself.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
