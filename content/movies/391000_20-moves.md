Tom Kremer stumbled upon an unwanted, unpatented puzzle game at the Nuremberg Toy Fair in 1979. It had been invented in Hungary in 1974 by Professor Erno Rubik who used it as a pedagogical aid for his architecture students and would go on to be played with by 1/5th of the world's population. We explore the cube's story - from its creation behind the Iron Curtain to the role it played in the fall of communism and the creation of free market trading in the former communist nations. We show how the cube was brought to the west - how it was introduced and marketed and what caused it to be the biggest fad of the 1980's. The cube would go on to symbolize an entire generation like nothing before it. The many faces, layers, and sides of 20 Moves is exactly like the cube. With each act our audience discovers another twist, another turn, another solve in the history of the Cube.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/99cJLCLYVIlP8Wi7JOPGqV3OjuE.jpg", "actors": ["Steven Adler (Himself)", "Drake Bell (Himself)", "Nantel Bergeron (Himself)", "Josh Chalom (Himself)", "DJ Quik (Himself)", "Louis Ferreira (Himself)", "Stuart Stone (Himself)", "Rob Van Dam (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "vLteE4ciYu8"}
