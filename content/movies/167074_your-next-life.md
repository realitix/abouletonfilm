He and his daughter Val conspire to keep the cause of death quiet, but tensions mount when Val becomes attracted to the dead farmer's son, Rai, estranged from his father and now a hairdresser in the city. The tensions open long-festering family resentments and spur the lurid imagination of Val's younger sister, the teen Genia. \"What goes unsaid, gets undone,\" the Pasiegos say, but is it true? Is there harm in staying silent?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q1s9wfPclvWh33rKNPXzIimJUs3.jpg", "actors": ["Juan Diego (Gildo)", "Luis Tosar (Rai)", "Marta Etura (Val)", "Clara Lago (Genia)", "Celso Bugallo (Severo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "OCy_y--c5mM"}
