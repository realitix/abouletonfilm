The 1964 Cuban/Soviet coproduction marked a watershed moment of cultural collaboration between two nations. Yet the film never found a mass audience, languishing for decades until its reintroduction as a \"classic\" in the 1990s. Vicente Ferraz explores the strange history of this cinematic tour de force, and the deeper meaning for those who participated in its creation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fqlghiH4JbDUJovlUfo8pl4UaOp.jpg", "actors": ["Othon Bastos ()", "Alexander Calzatti ()", "Fidel Castro ()", "Luz Mar\u00eda Collazo ()", "Sergio Corrieri ()", "Mauricio do Valle ()", "Evgeniy Evtushenko ()", "Vicente Ferraz ()", "Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda Losada ()", "Jean-Luc Godard ()", "Alfredo Guevara ()", "Tom\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez Alea ()", "Mikhail Kalatozov ()", "Enrique Pineda Barnet ()", "Glauber Rocha ()", "Sergey Urusevskiy ()", "Juan Varona ()", "Salvador Wood ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "SChhY0auEdI"}
