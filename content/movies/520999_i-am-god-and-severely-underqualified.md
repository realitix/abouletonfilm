He starts to struggle though, hitting a creative block, and he seeks ways to push through it. Looking for inspiration around him, he presses forward with his work, but the harsh, punctuating sound of a leaking sprinkler behind him leads to a terrifying realisation. - What he types seems to actually happen, and, unable to stop his hands, he starts to dread whether he is a creator, willing other worlds into being, or a character with no real choice at all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1myFt3VFG6HAoT7f98XsHv17hi8.jpg", "actors": ["Melvyn Rawlinson (The Writer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
