The Saturday Nights songs are upbeat, pairing subtle but expressive lyrics with fast-paced, brazen electric guitar; the Sunday Mornings selections have a more reflective, subdued tone. Lead singer Adam Duritz starts the night off right with a raucous version of the CD opener \u201c1492,\u201d then sings of loss in the moody \u201cWashington Square,\u201d accompanied by piano and acoustic guitar. His no-holds-barred emotion also resonates in slower songs like \u201cLe Ballet d'Or\u201d and \u201cWhen I Dream of Michelangelo.\u201d", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
