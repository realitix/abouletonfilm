The event was expected to be headlined by a lightweight bout between Dustin Poirier and Joseph Duffy. However, Duffy was forced to pull out of the fight on October 21, three days prior to the event, after sustaining a concussion during a sparring session earlier that week and the fight was scrapped. A flyweight bout between Paddy Holohan and Louis Smolka was promoted to serve as the event's new headliner. It was the first three-rounds main event bout since UFC 161 in June of 2013.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cr43UnV0wEmOIsSRCQd2ZP4SppE.jpg", "actors": ["Paddy Holohan (Himself)", "Louis Smolka (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
