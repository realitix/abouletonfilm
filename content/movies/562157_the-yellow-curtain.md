U.S. President, Jimmy Carter called it \"an island of stability\" in a visit. Yet, only two years later, in the winter of 1979, a revolution occurred. The Shah of Iran was overthrown and the Islamic Republic was established. It was a major change, a complete switch of power. THE YELLOW CURTAIN interweaves the stories of three men around this sensitive time in history--persecuted Persian author, Gholamhossein Saedi, one of his fictional characters, Mansour, and the filmmaker's own grandfather, who worked directly under the Shah. Through a poetic blending of literature and cinema, the film examines many lives turned upside down; and in one rare case, a life turned right side up.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pvz6Zhstw0d9lHtOq5gFF2rKu2x.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
