The DVD picture has great clarity, despite the darkness of Hans Schavernoch\u2019s set design. Other than the clich\u00e9 of a huge statue head, toppled on its side, the set manages to be suitably representative of a decaying palace as well as an imposing, theatrical space, dominated by the mammoth body of the statue from which the head apparently dropped, draped with the ropes that seem to have enabled the decapitation. Sooner or later most of the characters cling to and twist around those ropes, an apt stage metaphor for the remorseless repercussions from the murder of Agammenon by his unfaithful wife Klyt\u00e4mnestra and her paramour, Aegisthus. Reinhard Heinrich\u2019s costumes capture a distant era while sustaining a creepily modern look \u2014 part Goth, part homeless, part Spa-wear.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/foaytjQxyd6XKv8AJK3EW5ZLyX5.jpg", "actors": ["Claudio Abbado (Conductor)", "Eva Marton ()", "Brigitte Fassbaender ()", "Cheryl Studer ()", "James King ()", "Franz Grundheber ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
