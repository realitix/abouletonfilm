By 1933, he had reached rock bottom. How, in the space of a few years, did Buster Keaton, the uncontested genius of silent films, go from the status of being a widely-worshipped star to an alcoholic and solitary fallen idol?

Was it yet another episode of the never-ending struggle to hold onto one\u2019s freedom in the face of financiers?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ypigsVrQMLdcLBoinjjtNYZfXb4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
