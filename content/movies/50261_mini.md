Having lost both her parents at a young age, Mini has never had a real family, and her greatest dream is to find a love that she can rely on, a love that will make her fly. Kang (Liu Ye) works at a music store called Go With the Flow, which just about sums up his aimless lifestyle. Raised in an overly strict family, Kang grew up into a rebellious young man who likes to challenge social norms. These two very different young people meet by chance in the bustle of modern Shanghai, and spark a story of pure love and vertigo as their confused worlds collide.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/syg1k9bWnFHsch2eiA10l7wDiYx.jpg", "actors": ["Liu Ye (Kang)", "Roy Cheung ()", "Angelica Lee (Mini)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
