The composition is a manifesto of the author\u2019s way of life, this is why we decided to go inside the author\u2019s mind, and it is not a safe journey. A brain solo without filter, a tale of ordinary madness, showing how much loneliness and decadence can be hidden inside a genius mind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7ytZOQzWxmui9aceNJnXGBgNw1N.jpg", "actors": ["David Waine Callahan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
