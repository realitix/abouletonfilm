Directed by independent filmmaker Andy Anderson, Drive-by Shooting departs from the standard crime documentary and instead takes us on a sedentary, surreal journey through eerily lifeless streets while softly narrating details of crimes committed in or around the vicinity. \r\n\r\nBasically filmed from a passenger viewpoint, the film slowly and gradually lifts the lid on a wide spectrum of crimes ranging from petty theft all the way to murder. Occasionally, the backdrop departs from the seemingly serene residential streets and glances over an anonymous freeway or flyover, this is usually a cue for the description of particularly heinous or disturbing incidents. All the while spoken in a straight, monotone, almost trance like fashion. \r\n\r\nWell worth a watch if you want something out of the ordinary."}], "recommandations_id": []}
