An aspiring actor stuck in a small town who has big plans of moving to Hollywood so he can strike it rich. One night, while on his way into a corner store, he meets Didi, a pretty but aimless girl hanging out in the parking lot. Mike and Didi strike up a conversation, and she discovers there's a big dose of self-doubt lurking beneath his confident exterior. Mike, on the other hand, finds that the longer he talks to Didi, the more he finds himself thinking she might be a good reason to stick around.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bQbTOSukJOvDobe3VOkn7tT7SZl.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Gilio (Mike)", "Lara Phillips (Didi)", "Karin Anglin (Ruthie)", "Rich Komenich (Emil)", "Sunny Seigel (Sunny)", "Guy Barile (Ticket Teller)", "Pat McCartney (Bartender)", "Margaret Kustermann (Bev)", "Bob Breuler (Parole Board)", "Margaret Travolta (Juvie Nurse)", "Caitlin Hart (Motel Owner)", "Christian Stolte (Cop #1)", "James 'Ike' Eichling (Cop #2)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "6B7N8LKlJWw"}
