When her frustration drives her to commit a desperate act, she finds herself thrust headlong into a surrealistic netherworld where she must face her sexual fears and fantasies in order to get a second chance at life. Trapped in a psychedelic whorehouse somewhere between heaven and hell, Audrey embarks on a strange journey that brings her face-to-face with the notorious Dr. Stinkypinky, a couple of hole-hungry Sheiks, a cruel mistress, and the mechanical elves who run the universe.
