Not a good movie, not a bad either. The ending is abrupt and artificial, which seems to be a common plague of Third Reich's crime movies. Gustav Fr\u00f6hlich could never get rid of his silent era mannerisms and overacting. But on the other side, this film is not boring and has to offer some decent plot turns and acting.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eYOTr9nh0lTXwfM3ZZyzt4hnMnM.jpg", "actors": ["Gustav Fr\u00f6hlich (Westhoff)", "Otto Wernicke (Obermeister Kramp)", "Carola H\u00f6hn (Fanny)", "Bruni L\u00f6bel (Anneliese)", "Franz Schafheitlin (Greininger)", "O.E.
