Several of Vicente\u2019s uncles intend to their ailing mother\u2019s land without her knowledge. Vicente seeks help from the municipal president who, between shooting hoops on a desolate court, tells him that if he wants justice, he must head to the capital to meet with government officials.  Although he hasn\u2019t seen her since he was a child, Vicente sets off in search of his mother, who works as a maid in maze-like Mexico City. With the help of his mother\u2019s employer, a sophisticated middle-aged woman, he finds the government offices where he presents his case. His situation isn\u2019t easily resolved, especially since he does not have the deed to his grandmother\u2019s plot of land, and Vicente finds the complexities of the legal system to be completely overwhelming.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tVpEq58dWsKVhWNr3mNjp3BgoZO.jpg", "actors": ["Gabino Rodr\u00edguez (Vicente)", "Juana Rodriguez (Abuela)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
