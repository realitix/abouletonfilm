Every Sunday afternoon, two atheists debate callers for one hour, on camera. ATHEIST AMERICA portrays the show, its protagonists, and the discussions between the hosts and callers. The debates between believers and skeptics are funny, touching and shocking in turn, and they're interspersed with footage of the very public religious displays common in the state of Texas. The film is an intimate, concentrated, and entertaining insight into the culture wars, and is sure to provoke inspiration as well as frustration, no matter which side of the divide you fall on.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tibYBlDJjTV32gquumK1RaI9mNd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
