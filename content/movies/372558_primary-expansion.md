When different colors overlap, new colors emerge that consist of two or more primary layers and therefore have more strength to resist the high pressure. The process continues to produce rich structures and compositions from small imperfections and the mixing of colors until the pressure gets too high.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1TJyLahdDaHqnKopKw4ktb1ziS6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
