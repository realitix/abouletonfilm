He sneaks away from his wife to make a \"flash\" around town, and comes home at 2 A.M., feeling happy. His joy is short-lived, however, when he finds the door locked, and his spouse on the other side demands the money before she will permit him to enter. He takes half of it and hides it under a barrel, and his wife, peeping behind the curtain, sees him. After he has retired she goes out to get the rest of the money, and Hoffmeyer locks the door and refuses to let her in until she sends in the money. Clad in her nightgown, she is being thoroughly chilled, when she sees men approaching and runs away.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Ford Sterling (Hoffmeyer)", "Mack Sennett (The Police Chief)", "Fred Mace (Hoffmeyer's wife)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
