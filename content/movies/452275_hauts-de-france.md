This short hand-made film, entirely processed in red wine, surveys the area surrounding the Calais \u2018jungle\u2019 and allows the unique chemistry to stain our reading of the light and landscapes of Northern France while we share the carnival nightmares, nostalgia, and growing anxiety of an American filmmaker far from home.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
