A very entertaining 90 minutes indeed! It's full of the typical European goofy humor and even features a quick dance number once one Russian military captain, the beautiful Christina Penz, defects and makes it across the border into Austria! My favorite moment involves a camera doubles for a hand torch AND rotary saw!! I am sure Q was taking notes! Super fun happy time it is and I highly recommend!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v21Rs71zk15ekLInc5CYMBs6nuo.jpg", "actors": ["Fernando Sancho (Prof. Higgins)", "Eduardo Fajardo (General Poniatowski)", "Ingrid Schoeller (Tamara Maslova)", "Francesco Mul\u00e8 (Groeber)", "Pietro Martellanza (Alain (as Peter Martell))", "Andrea Aureli (Seryavin (as Andrew Ray))", "Giustino Durano (Roland)", "Daniele Vargas (Zak (as Caniele Vargas))", "Luciano Catenacci (Brett)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
