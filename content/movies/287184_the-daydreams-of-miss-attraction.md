She lives with her old mother (Suna Selen) and her uncle (Macit Koper) who feels an attraction towards her. The only thing which is private to her is her projector machine, which she keeps in a room at the roof of the house. Whenever she gets free time alone she goes to the room, sits on her rocking chair, switches on the projector and meets the boy she loved when she was at school, in her dreams. However, she believes that these are not dreams but that they are real, she really meets the boy whenever she switches on the projector. One day, a political criminal (one of her neighbors) come to their house at night to hide out. Cazibe thinks that he is the man in her dreams and makes love with him that night. The other day, the man leaves just with a note, and Cazibe loses her mind and starts to do strange things at home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/leXfYkJCkQcr9Ik5iXLyI6rd2iB.jpg", "actors": ["Macit Koper (Beh\u00e7et)", "U\u011fur Polat (K\u00fcr\u015fat)", "Suna Selen (F\u00fcruzan)", "Hale Soygazi (Cazibe)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
