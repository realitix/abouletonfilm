I saw this play screened at the Laemmle Theatre in Encino, CA. It was so good that after I saw it I fell down a flight of stairs leading from the theater to the parking lot because my legs could not carry me anymore. Janet McTeer astounds, Dominic West delivers, everyone thrills from moment to moment. Josie Rourke, as usual, directs to perfection. See this if at all possible. It is the best thing I have ever put in my eyes."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "yo3u-arsG2M"}
