Wild parties, lesbianism, and premarital sex are some of the forms of madness portrayed. The educational aspect of the film allowed it to portray a taboo subject which was otherwise forbidden by the Production Code of 1930, and its stricter version imposed by Hollywood studios in July 1934.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Vivian McGill (Millicent Hamilton)", "Rose Tapley (Mrs. Hamilton)", "Al Rigali (Mr. Hamilton)", "Mark Daniels (Wendel Hope (as Stanley Barton))", "Linda Lee Hill (Sheila Wayne)", "Ruth Edell (Mrs. Fay)", "Charles Olcott (Paul Lorenz)", "Ed Redding (Dr. Hampton)", "Pat Lawrence (Tom Lorenz)", "Allen Tower (Dr. Harris)", "Richard Bengali (Mr. Maynard)", "W.
