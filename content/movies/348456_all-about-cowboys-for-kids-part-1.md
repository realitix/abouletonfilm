Beth sings both classic and original songs. We visit the Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo where bull riders and wild bronco busters match their skills against 1500-pound bulls and wild, bucking horses. We visit Bridger, a 7-year-old cowboy, and his pony Mabel. See amazing trick riders, crack a bullwhip, tame a wild horse, and meet Max Reynolds, a world-class trick roper. All this against backdrops of blue skies, misty mountains, and the golden prairie. Kids will learn, laugh, and want more. Grown-ups, too. Parents' Choice award-winner and chosen by Parenting Magazine as one of the top kid videos of the year.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
