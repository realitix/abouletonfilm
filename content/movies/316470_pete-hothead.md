Pete Hothead was featured in only one other cartoon. In this one he receives a parrot from a store rather than the radio he ordered. In his attempts to exchange the parrot for a radio, he cause much havoc, disruptions and chaos in the store. He finally gets his radio, but then decides he'd rather have a television set.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jerry Hausner (Pete Hothead (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
