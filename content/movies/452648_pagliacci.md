The film stars Tito Gobbi and Gina Lollobrigida. It recounts the tragedy of Canio, the lead clown (or pagliaccio in Italian) in a commedia dell'arte troupe, his wife Nedda, and her lover, Silvio. When Nedda spurns the advances of Tonio, another player in the troupe, he tells Canio about Nedda's betrayal. In a jealous rage Canio murders both Nedda and Silvio. The only actor in the cast who also sang his role was the celebrated Italian baritone, Tito Gobbi, but the film is largely very faithful to its source material, presenting the opera nearly complete.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bC3hgNnnExA85X5xMrq8CoViz9g.jpg", "actors": ["Tito Gobbi (Tonio/Silvio)", "Gina Lollobrigida (Nedda)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
