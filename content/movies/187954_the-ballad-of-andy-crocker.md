Unfortunately, this flick\u2019s nowhere near as good as \u201cComing Home.\u201d It\u2019s a sad sack drama highlighted by the late 60\u2019s setting and jaw-dropping beauty of curvy Joey Heatherton (as Lisa). Cutie Jill Haworth is also on hand as a hippie chick in the opening act. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is also interesting: Motown\u2019s Marvin Gaye plays a fellow soldier, Jimmy Dean a dubious business partner and Pat Hingle the dad. Righteous Brother Bobby Hatfield and Agnes Moorehead (Endora from Bewitched) even show up.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 13 minutes and looks like it was shot in California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+"}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
