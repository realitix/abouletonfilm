Though I like the French version done at the Chalet in 1996, this is still the best. I first saw it in 1979 on stage. This was the 1980 telecast from the Met. The sound was still a bit rudimentary. Mike placements and balance not as good as they would be in three seasons. At times, even the biggest voices fade until they move to a better spot.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rlGMC7AIHgLb5f4y4euBu70yUpW.jpg", "actors": ["Vasile Moldoveanu (Don Carlo)", "Renata Scotto (Elisabeth of Valois)", "Paul Plishka (Philip II)", "Sherrill Milnes (Rodrigo, Marquis of Posa)", "Tatiana Troyanos (Princess of Eboli)", "Jerome Hines (The Grand Inquisitor)", "Betsy Norden (Tebaldo)", "Dana Talley (The Count of Lerma)", "Barbara Greene (The Countess of Aremberg)", "Timothy Jenkins (A celestial voice)", "James Levine (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
