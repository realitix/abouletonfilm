But just a few short years later, Akron's most important product was, ever so briefly, music. In the mid-1970s, a group of local bands took over an old rubber workers' hang-out in downtown Akron called The Crypt and created a mix of punk and art rock that came to be known as \"the Akron Sound.\" And for a while, it was almost \"the next big thing.\" Almost.  It's Everything, and Then It's Gone, a Western Reserve PBS production written and directed by Phil Hoffman., takes viewers back to a time when the music really did mean everything. And for the men and women in these local bands, it was a way out of the factory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j6oR1eyZiXrrjGzyj5frlWp74BB.jpg", "actors": ["Devo (Themselves)", "Joe Walsh (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
