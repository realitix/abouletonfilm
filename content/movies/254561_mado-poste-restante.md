She even puts up posters on trees and walls advertising her interest. The townspeople make fun of her, but she isn't discouraged. Her best friend is Germaine (Isabelle Gelinas), a pretty girl whose moral standards are not as strict as Mado's. When a film director (Oleg Yankovsky) arrives in town, everyone is agog, but Mado is particularly keen to find out about him. However, it seems that he has his eye on Germaine, and he isn't really in her league anyhow.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gbT79ZkJZU5aX8RkgjRmCxm2FEj.jpg", "actors": ["Marianne Groves (Mado)", "Oleg Yankovskiy (Jean-Marie)", "Isabelle G\u00e9linas (Germaine)", "Jean-Pierre Darroussin (Le berger)", "Bernard Freyd (Le cur\u00e9 / Priest)", "Andr\u00e9 Pomarat (Perduvent)", "Michel Winogradoff (Henry, l'amant)", "Olivier Pajot (Belfour)", "Maryse Deol ()", "V\u00e9ronique Kapoyan ()", "Fran\u00e7ois Clavier ()", "Pierre-Olivier Mornas ()", "Marie Mergey (Mlle Blanche)", "Fernand Berset ()", "Elisabeth Rambert (Mme Plantu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
