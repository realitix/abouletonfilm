Here, men are men, women are just future wives and there is nothing gay about helping a guy out! Good ol' fratboy Kevin is straight as an arrow (if you don't count his gay fantasies when intertwined with his girlfriend), but he begins to see things a little queerly when he meets the sexy openly gay C\u00e9sar Can a straight guy fall for another dude? And can Kevin continue going down on his old pal (Dylan Vox) under the belief that it is just fratboy hijinks? And will kissing C\u00e9sar change him forever? Never has a film featured so many straight men doing so many gay things as beer is guzzled, pants are dropped and playful bed-hopping ensues. Fast, fun and sexy - what more could you want from a film?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8Fc9BFBVZXaZBrYhteZmRCGFneH.jpg", "actors": ["Jacob Newton (Kevin)", "Derek Efrain Villanueva (C\u00e9sar)", "Dylan Vox (Steve)", "Kevin Held (Justin)", "Stephen Matzke (Daniel)", "Bonnie Marion (Marsha)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [116272, 56310, 259997, 54325], "youtube_key": "xpRlwb4lsk0"}
