While prior to the Crusades different groups coexisted more or less peacefully, the trauma of the European invasions shaped today's familiar dichotomies\u2014East and West, Christianity and Islam, Shi\u2019ism and Sunni\u2019ism. At first sight a history lesson for children, the project ultimately raises important questions about the historicity of identity and consequently the role of history itself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/45fcwaqWxudCpYku2Ko7PHV1WEg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
