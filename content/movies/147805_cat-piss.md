Under the premise that he would live with the man 24/7 and record their \u201crelationship\u201d, Piss provides the kind of retro-realistic view into the world of the marginalized that few films \u2013 let alone filmmakers \u2013 would ever dare discuss. As our director helps out around the decaying trailer, as Lavern has imaginary political debates with a broken TV, as flutes are practiced and cats are comforted, this is what the end of one\u2019s days really looks like.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6IPLop6CxJZtASTUSfohVjg8BAh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
