Each DVD includes short-form Presidential biographies, era overviews for historical context, and thematic segments such as The Making of the Presidency and We the People. The DVD content is based on National Curriculum Standards and features interviews with political luminaries such as Sam Donaldson, Wesley Clark, Paul Begala, Melissa Harris-Lacewell and many more.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3y6Itotugd6o8HrfM2sMWf6KCxA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
