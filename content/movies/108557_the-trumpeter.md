In this story, which takes place shortly after that time, three outlaws murder a group of people on their way to a wedding. One young man was a slave travelling with the group to entertain them with his skills as a trumpeter. The outlaws spare him for the same reason. He allows himself to believe that they are really an unattached group of independence-fighters, but after seeing their brutal and callous ways, he cannot believe that they are good men, and he turns them in to the authorities. At that point, he is unnerved to discover how nobly they bear the rigors of captivity. ~", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pyEMFPNhchjctDMbPoj4WInWV4C.jpg", "actors": ["Ferenc F\u00e1bi\u00e1n (Havr\u00e1n)", "Ferenc Bencze (Bajusz)", "R\u00f3bert Koltai (Jank\u00f3)", "Zolt\u00e1n Csoma (Trombit\u00e1s)", "Ferenc B\u00e1cs (Hadnagy)", "Zolt\u00e1n Papp (Toborz\u00f3 paraszt)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
