The Quays display a passion for detail, a breathtaking command of color and texture, and an uncanny use of focus and camera movement that make their films unique and instantly recognizable. Best known for their classic 1986 film STREET OF CROCODILES -- which filmmaker Terry Gilliam recently selected as one of the ten best animated films of all time -- they are masters of miniaturization and on their tiny sets have created an unforgettable world, suggestive of a landscape of long-repressed childhood dreams.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c4ClnFc4jaNXqobei09FIECIjYN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
