The feature focuses exclusively on the youth of Chopin (who died at age 39), spanning his 15th year (c. 1825) through his 21st year (c. 1831); it also depicts Chopin as both prodigiously gifted and one filled with a tremendous spirit of Polish nationalism. Ford concludes with the onset of the illness that eventually killed Ford, set against the backdrop of the famous November Uprising in 1830.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7fsnizBE83fAotLQJfroDSd5b00.jpg", "actors": ["Czes\u0142aw Wo\u0142\u0142ejko (Fryderyk Chopin)", "Zbigniew \u0141obodzi\u0144ski (Seweryn Goszczynski)", "J\u00f3zef Nieweglowski (Dominik Magnuszewski)", "Jerzy Duszy\u0144ski (Stefan Witwicki)", "Jerzy Pietraszkiewicz (Bohdan Zaleski)", "Leon Pietraszkiewicz (Nikolaj N.
