At heart, the movie asks the viewer to decide if these characters are right or wrong in their doings. Every character has a dilemma, and they all come to terms with it in their own way. But morally, are they wrong? Or are the victims of their own surroundings? There is no clear answer, making the viewer the ultimate judge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/KH9ph8coH5WfXNpjwqk1fwbWd1.jpg", "actors": ["Pasquale Di Diana (Tommy)", "Marco Tazioli (Johnny)", "Anthony Bonaventura (Jimmy)", "Brian Petsos (Alex)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
