Floundering in all aspects of his life, Ben's only comfort comes from regular chess games and friendly debates on game theory with his Senegalese roommate Ibou. When Ibou is suddenly struck ill, Ben's pessimistic worldview seems unequivocally confirmed. It takes an extended visit from Ibou's sister Khadi for Ben to realize that cynicism may be all a matter of perspective.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jGVAwlwTg6AuVjd5qChqEKxy7uG.jpg", "actors": ["Matthew Broderick (Ben Singer)", "Sanaa Lathan (Khadi)", "Michael Kenneth Williams (Ibu)", "Mia Ford (Maxine - Cyril's Daughter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [14669, 30262, 77434, 99254], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
