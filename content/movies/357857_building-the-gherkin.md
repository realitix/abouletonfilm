Just a month and a day after the disastrous attack on the World Trade Center in New York, the first steel beam of a new tower is erected in London. One question is on everybody\u2019s mind: is it the right decision to build a new iconic tower in the midst of London\u2019s financial district, on a site that has already been bombed before?  The 40-storey steel and glass tower sparks further controversy. Norman Foster, one of Britain\u2019s most visionary architects, calls his design for the new Swiss Re London headquarters \u2018radial \u2013 socially, technically, architecturally and spatially\u2019. In fact, its size and shape are so radical that it is almost immediately nicknamed \u2018the erotic gherkin\u2019.  Will the Gherkin become the landmark they all dream of?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Norman Foster (Himself)", "Picardi Carla (Herself)", "John Coomber (Himself)", "Forrester John (Himself)", "Walter Kielholz (Himself)", "Ken Livingstone (Himself)", "Scott Paul (Himself)", "Partington Robin (Himself)", "Fox Sara (Herself)", "Rees Peter Wynne (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "zDDLJRs39V8"}
