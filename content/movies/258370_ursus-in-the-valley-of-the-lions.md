The plot concerns Ursus' attempts to rescue his kidnapped fiancee, aided by a pretty blind slave girl. Now an evil queen, Ursus' former love throws him into a gladiatorial arena with a bull, which manages to smack the slave girl in the head and restore her eyesight before Ursus defeats it and his enemies. The bullfight is particularly well-staged, and this exciting spectacle may be the highlight of Fury's erratic screen career. ~ Robert Firsching, Rovi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d5gWhP7TUabxkNyMlF4pvgsVo5F.jpg", "actors": ["Ed Fury (Ursus)", "Moira Orfei (Attea)", "Alberto Lupo (Ayak)", "Giacomo Furia (Simud)", "Mar\u00eda Luisa Merlo ()", "Michele Malaspina ()", "Mariangela Giordano (Annia)", "G\u00e9rard Herter (Lothar)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
