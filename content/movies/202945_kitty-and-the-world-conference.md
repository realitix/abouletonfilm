The film tells the story of the young Kitty (Hannelore Schroth), who works as a manicurist at the Eden Hotel, and who in the course of events gets to know both a young journalist (Christian Gollong) and the English minister of economics (Fritz Odemar). A lot of wild mix-ups, comic situations, a love story and occasional singing ensue, and in the end most of the VIPs have gained their share of laughter\u2026 There\u2019s also a great performance by Paul H\u00f6rbiger as the hotel porter. For a 1939 film made in Germany, \u201cKitty\u201d is remarkably irreverent and satirical about politics.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lVtNWPLXMfJDGLWVL6xLfNiHOIj.jpg", "actors": ["Hannelore Schroth (Kitty)", "Fritz Odemar (Sir Horace Ashlin)", "Max G\u00fclstorff (Vicomte Tristan de Gavard)", "Paul H\u00f6rbiger (Portier Franz Huber)", "Hubert von Meyerinck (Carter)", "Rudolf Sch\u00fcndler (Rundfunkreporter)", "Franz Arzdorf (Hoteldirektor F\u00fc\u00dfli)", "Maria Nicklisch (Irene Sorel)", "Charlott Daudert (Mimi)", "Leopold von Ledebur (Ministerialsekret\u00e4r Mason)", "Hermann Pfeiffer (Paillot)", "Christian Gollong ()", "Helmut Weiss ()", "Herbert H\u00fcbner ()", "Wilhelm Bendow ()", "Harald Wolff ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
