However, his mission is complicated by the fact that Helene, the ambassador's wife, is extremely jealous of every woman he meets, for she was responsible for getting him his appointment as attach\u00e9. Belmar, nevertheless, is in love with Greta, who will not marry him until he is proven worthy of her trust. After many narrow escapes from exposure of the personal intrigue, he manages to sway the attentions of Mona, who persuades the war minister to sign the treaty, thus gaining Belmar an appointment as ambassador to Peru and Greta as his wife.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Johannes Riemann (Marquis de Saint Lac)", "Olga Tschechowa (Manuela)", "Hans Junkermann (The Minister of War)", "Tala Birell (Marie-Anne)", "Arnold Korff (The Messenger)", "Albert Conti (Emile)", "Paul Weigel (Dr. Munaterra)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
