They are geniuses, mavericks and dreamers -- Malcolm Gladwell's budding 'outliers.' Among them may be the next Einstein, Mozart or Steve Jobs... if they can survive the American school system and their own eccentricities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2oXWyzhSZ3YZTr3oVXbuW3Lwr0o.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
