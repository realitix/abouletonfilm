Fun, frightening and fast-paced, glossily-produced and featuring gorgeous female fans with fangs, this is McFly as even their mothers would be scared to see them. The 30 minute film follows the boys from a daytime TV sofa to an isolated mansion where they try to ensure the future of McFly by taking their shirts off and plotting to murder one of their members.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ngWEodebHbbl2TBzg9tMkoDdX9R.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Fletcher (Himself)", "Harry Judd (Himself)", "Dougie Poynter (Himself)", "Danny Jones (Himself)", "Luke Healy (Manager)", "Leanne Michael (Cleaner)", "Nic Sleight (Replacement Drummer)", "Lucy Edwards (TV Presenter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
