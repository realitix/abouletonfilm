With water, or the lack of it, becoming the central motif, this two-part feature length film takes us on a journey across 8 interweaved stories and 10 languages, as the protagonists, consisting of non-professional actors, grapple with this hopefully temporary discomfort, amidst their dalliance with human foibles, and their fantasies of everlasting loves and broken romances.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6Q5WDEsUc2K5KbsN02jtKWBn5Fl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
