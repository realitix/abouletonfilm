Featuring live performances from Atlantic City and Wildwood, N.J., this film captures the comic in peak form, holding forth in his trademark character-driven, storytelling style that'll have you laughing until it hurts. But be forewarned, these adult-themed shows are not recommended for young viewers.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
