The director knows buxom starlets are the key to his success. But when the ladies start disappearing one by one, his plan goes bust -- and he goes crazy. Indie rockers Space Probe Taurus provide the soundtrack to this unrated director's cut that leaves little to the imagination.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8yWAgIzg7ShDe2QBnH9CC0v7tjL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
