And now she sleeps at her studio, scraping together just enough to survive. Alexandra Lihacheva places Krenalinova center stage in her directorial debut. She is on-screen for almost the entire documentary: in extreme close-up while being cross-examined by the public prosecutor, and muddled but stoical as she reveals her motives. She has no regrets, and she would be just as happy to set the entire city alight. In the rare moments that Katya is filmed outside, she wanders around in the snow near the burned down house. She poses for the camera like a model in an artistic music video, elusive and mysterious.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
