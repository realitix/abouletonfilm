At the center of the cult are the spirit mediums, often homosexual men, who communicate with the nats and take on their flamboyant characteristics in ecstatic rituals. Guided by two lively 70-year olds, director Lindsey Merrison explores the role of the spirit mediums in Burmese society in this fascinating documentary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ccIKBHtqpNGuGCIJmqTWUvQeUak.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
