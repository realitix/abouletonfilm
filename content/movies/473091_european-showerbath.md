The first person who enters the shower is a portly man with a German flag painted on him. Next it's a lady with large breasts with the French flag displayed on her. Other people/countries enter the shower, seeming to follow in an order of importance and influence. Eventually the shower is crowded, and the small countries stand on the outside looking in. Then the shower stops. It's too late for them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fqwBdmOM740BvRLTQViFSoJ9Ngg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
