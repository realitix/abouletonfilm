Warner Bros.' Captain Thunder contains some of the darndest Mexican accents you've ever heard in your life.  The star is Hungarian-born Victor Varconi, portraying a legendary south of the border outlaw who tries to force Canadian senorita Fay Wray to marry a rival rustler whom she despises.  She pleads with the bandito so pathetically that he is moved to grant her a single wish.  Without hesitation she chooses her poor but true love. The bandit king, being a somewhat honorable fellow grants the wish and without a twitch, guns down the wicked cattle thief.  Fortunately the film was played for comedy, a wise decision since it probably would have garnered laughs as a straight drama anyway.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5TVzRhh7jqwVweZCPjQBXAZgQ5d.jpg", "actors": ["Fay Wray (Ynez)", "Victor Varconi (El Captain Thunder)", "Charles Judels (Ruiz)", "Natalie Moorhead (Bonita)", "Robert Elliott (Morgan)", "Bert Roach (Pablo)", "Frank Campeau (Hank)", "Don Alvarado (Juan)", "John St. Polis (Pedro)", "Robert Emmett Keane (Don Miguel)", "Frankie Genardi ()", "Soledad Jim\u00e9nez (Se\u00f1ora Ruiz)", "Frank Lackteen (Messenger)", "Harry Semels (Barfly)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
