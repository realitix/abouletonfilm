In its opening you see the death of a woman named Maritza Martin, who was gunned down by her ex-husband on Spanish language television. We then witness British SAS troopers storming the Iranian Embassy in 1980, this is followed by a police chase of a criminal in a pick up truck and the deadly finale. It then goes to footage of animal experiments with a grizzly scene of a live pig being burned alive with a torch. Autopsy footage is then shown of an Asian individual. We are then shown a very graphic presentation on a male to female sex change operation. One interesting scene has a man who had his nasal cavity removed and replaced with a prosthetic, the footage is most interesting and worth the price of admission.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ycRlXs52uIpO8l1nFq0Fq7FnxT6.jpg", "actors": ["Damon Fox (Narrator)", "Maritza Martin Munoz (Herself - Woman Murdered by Ex-husband on Spanish TV Show 'Ocurrio Asi' (archive footage))", "Emilio Nunez (Himself - Man Who Murdered Ex-wife on Spanish TV Show 'Ocurrio Asi' (archive footage))", "James Vance (Himself (archive footage))", "Pit Dernitz (Himself (archive footage) (uncredited))", "Carol Durnet (Herself (archive footage) (uncredited))", "Graham Durnet (Himself (archive footage) (uncredited))", "Kim Durnet (Herself (archive footage) (uncredited))", "R.
