From this perspective it is therefore interesting to look at Bergman through their eyes. \u201dThe Men and Bergman\u201d is dedicated to the late Ingmar Bergman where several prominent Swedish actors; Thommy Berggren, B\u00f6rje Ahlstedt, Thorsten Flinck and Erland Josephson discuss their work with Bergman in film and theater. We are given a unique portrait of Ingmar Bergman as a personal instructor and coach, as a human being, spanning from the earlier years in the 1950\u2019s to his last theater productions fifty years later. We are treated to stories about Bergman the director as well as personal anecdotes about Bergman the man. Renowned Swedish film critic Nils Petter Sundgren, who has followed Ingmar Bergman throughout his career, hosts the program.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ipLp3QgtBlwGKgWAakmBvwHBoiY.jpg", "actors": ["Thorsten Flinck ()", "Nils-Petter Sundgren ()", "B\u00f6rje Ahlstedt ()", "Thommy Berggren ()", "Erland Josephson ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
