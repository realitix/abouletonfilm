Jo is the bright spark in Claire\u2019s recently darkened reality; a new friend in an otherwise isolated world. The two young women hit the town to let off some steam-and find themselves in trouble with local law enforcement. In the blink of an eye, Claire discovers that Jo is not what she seems-not at all-and her easy friendship with the lighthearted, young woman splits open to reveal the truth. Luminously shot in black and white, Josephine Doe is a raw exploration of family trauma and mental health that shows the thin line between our realities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dddw96PHoVaheCBMz6jyPgv1K93.jpg", "actors": ["Erin Cipolletti (Claire)", "Emma Griffin (Josephine)", "Elisabeth Bennett (Angie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "d3_7mfuLCko"}
