Normally, each individual frame of film depicts the entire space but only a moment in time (1/24 second). With tx-transformed films, it is just the opposite: each frame shows the entire time but only a tiny portion of space (the left side of the picture is \"before,^\u00d4 the right side is \"after^\u00d4). \u2014Virgil Widrich", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rtzVsOZvPvvE30831bW1TmSdG1V.jpg", "actors": ["Enrico Jakob ()", "Heinrich Kr\u00f6ncke ()", "Florian Ladst\u00e4tter ()", "Horst Mayer ()", "Hans Reisinger ()", "Thomas Reisinger ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
