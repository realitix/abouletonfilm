To fend off Black Dog's attempt to collect a gaming debt, Jih says he can't repay the money because he needs it for the funeral of his father (Bin-hui Lee) -- who once saved the mafioso's life. Trouble is, Jih's father is alive, and Black Dog plans to attend the memorial service.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/byNi8Cf91QfCKnaN58s29eT7V4l.jpg", "actors": ["Akio Chen ()", "Ding Ning ()", "Tsai Chen-Nan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
