Challenging all taboos in his exploration of \u201cbirth, sex, death, and the search for God,\u201d he has turned his camera on explicit lovemaking, childbirth, even autopsy. Many of his most famous works pursue the nature of vision itself and transcend the act of filming. Some, including the legendary Mothlight, were made without using a camera at all, as he pioneered the art of making images directly on film, by drawing, painting, and scratching.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pNq69l8VLIZbheepR5KwGxWxVLu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
