Interviews with men on both sides of each battle offer a fresh look at the war.\r On June 6, 1944, Allied aerial photo reconnaissance flew 25 sorties along the Normandy beaches to record hour-by-hour progress of D-Day. Recently rediscovered and included in our 2-hour special, the photographs had only been seen by a handful of people. Now, for the first time in 60 years, the images reveal history in the making. Using revolutionary computer software to bring the aerial photos alive, we fly along the D-Day beaches. Features firsthand accounts from US, UK, and German veterans.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
