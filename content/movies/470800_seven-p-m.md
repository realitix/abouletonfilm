However, everyday at 7pm she strives to make her scheduled brief encounter with a stranger. She lives for this moment as it gives her day purpose, preventing her surrendering to her own existential crisis. The moment breathes a glimmer of hope that she may actually be able to grasp hold of something meaningful in her life... however, as quickly as the moment comes, it disappears. And once it is over her reality crashes in to her again and Fox falls back in to her vacant cycle. SEVEN P.M. is a glimpse in to a day in the life of Fox and her obsessive desperation to meet her own deadline.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rLIzD0qY7EYKRHhB8VOd6SrXN6l.jpg", "actors": ["Austin Hardiman (The Man)", "Lily Loveless (Fox)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
