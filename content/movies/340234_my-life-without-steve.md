Through a study of Liz\u2019s obsession and loneliness, the film mixes the particular with the universal to cover the whole gamut of feelings and theories about lost love. Ranging from the popular to the more erudite, snatches of songs, quotes and diary jottings are all stitched together with stories from Liz\u2019s past and descriptions in minutiae of her current existence. The B side of love is richly played out through the words of an A team of interpreters from Split Enz, Laurie Anderson and Bob Dylan to Freud, Marge Piercy, Collete and Roland Barthes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kPR9lnp4ZbCntYiENjKMb8fGGdV.jpg", "actors": ["Jenny Vuletic (voiceover)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
