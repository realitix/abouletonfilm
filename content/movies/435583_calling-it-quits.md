His struggles with everyday life, his past, even the question of 'the existence of a higher power', have led him to evaluate his own life. An assessment, that ultimately drives him to leave work and success behind, and set out on a quest in search of his happiness. But Dante soon learns that it's not that simple, for after a series of painfully humorous attempts fail to provide an answer, Dante sinks even deeper. It is not until he encounters Cynthia, a spiritual guide of sorts, that he uncovers the underlying truth and finally arrives at an answer that surprises even him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3ghtmg3THEVcXEyBXQCqLOS5A0b.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Aberdeen (Gastroenterologist)", "Julie Berndt (Deborah)", "Matty Blake (Cal)", "Marc Bonan (Young Dante)", "Dennis Boutsikaris (Dante)", "Kristen Bush (Young Alba)", "Orlagh Cassidy (Marcy - Agency Exec.)", "Casey Cipriani (Meditation Student)", "Robert Clohessy (Jake)", "Michael Cullen (James - Agency Exec.)", "Aryn Elaine Cole (Waitress)", "Paul Fears (Roommate)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
