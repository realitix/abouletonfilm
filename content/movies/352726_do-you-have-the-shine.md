The setting for the film is inspired by the hotel in Stanley Kubrick's film,\"The Shining\". The viewer sees the deserted hotel corridors through the eyes of a boy on a tricycle. In spite of the non-interactive nature of the medium, the film is built up like the video game it is based upon. Through the rules presented in the intro and the rolling pointmarks, the viewer is inscribed with the notion that they are able to determine the course of the film. Corner after corner are passed with the uncomfortable, anxious feeling that decades of horror film have imprinted in all of us.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fHubWTtXu89htkwk8rzxfQmPFqC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
