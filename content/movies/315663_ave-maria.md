Mourning the loss of the only woman he ever loved, concert singer Tino Dossi (Gigli) is temporarily shaken from his doldrums by vivacious Montmartre entertainer Claudette (Kaethe Von Nagy). Dossi doesn't realize that Claudette is merely using him to advance her own singing career. Ultimately won over by Dossi's sincerity and courtesy, Claudette falls in love with him for real, only to suffer the pangs of conscience as a result. About to kill herself, she decides instead to return to Dossi's arms, vowing never to confess her original mercenary intentions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yRl9vzX0NgxZ3MRJyrao0CYzKuB.jpg", "actors": ["Beniamino Gigli (Tino Dossi)", "K\u00e4the von Nagy (Claudette)", "Harald Paulsen (Michel)", "Paul Henckels (Amadeo Winkler)", "Erna Berger (Violetta)", "Carl Auen (Arzt)", "Herbert H\u00fcbner (Konzertdirektor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
