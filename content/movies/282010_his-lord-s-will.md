But love and fate also plays their cards.  One of the most surprising films of Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, close to Stroheim and some of the silent comedies of Lubitsch. Belonging to the golden age of Swedish film, this comedy offers one of the earliest explorations of the relationship between masters and servants on the screen, later developed by French masters like Renoir and Guitry.  After acting in the diptych of Thomas Graal, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m shows that he also dominates the \u201clight genre\u201d as director.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2BX0quSRJlmCYSSCDXiuOR1wSOk.jpg", "actors": ["Carl Browallius (Wickberg)", "Greta Almroth (Blenda)", "Karl Mantzius (His Lordship Roger Bernhuses de Sars)", "Tyra D\u00f6rum (Mrs. Enberg)", "Georg Blickingberg (Toni)", "Semmy Friedmann (Jacob)", "Augusta Lindberg (Mrs. Hyltenius)", "Sture Baude (Roger Hyltenius)", "Nils Ar\u00e9hn (Mayor Bjoerner)", "Josua Bengtson (Jonsson)", "Sigurd Wall\u00e9n (School Inspector)", "Carl Borin (Teacher)", "Emil Fjellstr\u00f6m (Mailman)", "Olof \u00c5s (Farmhand)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
