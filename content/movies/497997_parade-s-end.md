As the war works a profound change on Europe, and Chrissy is badly wounded in France, the conflict shatters and rearranges the lives of all three principals, as well as virtually everyone else in their elite circle.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x10tfU2V7OezWBQY7IM0kHfuxxP.jpg", "actors": ["Benedict Cumberbatch (Christopher Tietjens)", "Rebecca Hall (Sylvia Tietjens)", "Adelaide Clemens (Valentine Wannop)", "Miranda Richardson (Mrs. Wannop)", "Freddie Fox (Edward Wannop)", "Janet McTeer (Mrs. Satterthwaite)", "Ned Dennehy (Father Consett)", "Alan Howard (Tietjens Senior)", "Rupert Everett (Mark Tietjens)", "Stephen Graham (Vincent Macmaster)", "Anne-Marie Duff (Edith Duchemin)", "Rufus Sewell (Reverend Duchemin)", "Roger Allam (General Edward Campion)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [432517, 152737], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
