If we choose nurture over nature, these people\u2019s efforts are nothing more then the efforts we all make to get back on our feet after an inescapable misfortune", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/opmAbgX3CAahdEreSljKPQuXdXS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
