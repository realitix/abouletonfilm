He wants to go back to Egypt to seek the grave of his parents so that he can say goodbye to them.  Klaas sees that trip is not going to be easy. He finds flying to Egypt scary, it costs way too much money and Dummie has no passport. But if Dummie's painting by Miss Friek is sold for a large amount and he can organise a passport, then can Klaas, Goos, Dummie and Miss Friek leave for Egypt.  But is the Tomb of Achnetoet still available after four thousand years? With a plan by Master Drab, Dummie and Goos are investigating. But the search is full of dangers and the best friends walk into a trap. Can Klaas save them on time or keep Dummie and Goos captive forever?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zzUAZxIU2gVtKJWElfTYqN7jQWt.jpg", "actors": ["Julian Ras (Goos Guts)", "Roeland Fernhout (Klaas Guts)", "Jennifer Hoffman (Juffrouw Friek)", "Manou Kersting (Douanier)", "Stefan de Walle (Meester Krabbel)", "Mike Weerts (Suppoost)", "Yahya Gaier (Dummie)", "Ergun Simsek (Farid)", "G\u00fcrkan K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fcksent\u00fcrk (Aziz)", "Yannick Jozefzoon (Suppoost)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "l3AJWZaUb28"}
