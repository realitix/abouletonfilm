With the head angel outraged after viewing a compilation of scenes of (remarkably innocent-looking) human excess on Earth, blue-eyed Husayn Fahmi - frequently cast as something of an otherworldly enigma in Egyptian movies - gets to observe humanity at first hand, becoming embroiled in organised crime and murder but nevertheless concluding that humankind (not to mention fallen angels like himself) are still worthy of redemption.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
