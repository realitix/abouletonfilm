But not known, is a legacy contested? Goodbye Philippines surveys an undead landscape, textured by phantoms. It is as if this feeling of a legacy regards tradition and cultural custom as memories repossessed by the setting. Here a family less acts and instead sets the scene for departure, in preparation for some entrance, whether it is into a room or a different realm. But is entering here where even the most banal tasks are elucidated and no longer customary, rather made a part of mythology.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vACQlPTIN7RBjKwZbdY90EvHFTo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
