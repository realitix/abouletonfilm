He knows little about apartheid and so at first sees no contradiction in developing a relationship with an elite, upper-class white woman and with a woman dedicated to fighting apartheid. But as Toby makes friends with one of the black South Africans (Zaku Mokae), and as he registers both the subtle and more obvious, deep-seated racial prejudices of the minority white population, some of the truth of the oppression here begins to dawn. That is brought to a head when tragedy strikes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oajcicNcyGW5zbzsy6O08TIYeBq.jpg", "actors": ["Zakes Mokae (Steven Sitole)", "Evelyn Frank (Anna Louw)", "Marijke Mann (Cecil)", "Ivan Jackson (Toby)", "Cocky Tlhotlhalemaje (Amon Mofokeng)", "Shirley Jeffery (Mrs. Javis, landlady)", "Gideon Nxomalo (Sam Mofokenzazi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "KkGfDCDcVcA"}
