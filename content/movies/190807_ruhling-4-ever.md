The ambition on this production was to give a closer look to the private life of the athlet and the private person Markus R\u00fchl. Therefore beside the professional filmed training scenes, which are co-moderated from german pro trainer Pit Trenz, there are much never seen private material. Markus and his wife Simone are filming there journeys by themself and give you a private view. As is usual funny, disrespectful, self-ironic and unique!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ahCxrpNDL00wp8ArHgU9HW7PLky.jpg", "actors": ["Markus R\u00fchl (Himself)", "Simone R\u00fchl (Herself)", "Pit Trenz (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
