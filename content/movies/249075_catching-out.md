These individualists choose to eschew the comforts of modern American life to pursue the freedom and unpredictability of riding the rails, a choice that reflects both their lifestyle preference and a personal philosophy that is often based on environmental concerns. Through Sarah's insightful interviews, the modern hobos discuss their unique experiences and the incredible thrill of train-hopping.\r - Written by Sujit R.
