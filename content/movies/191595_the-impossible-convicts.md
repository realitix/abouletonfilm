Later, one overpowers a guard and springs his three pals. But, will they be able to pull off an escape? Other guards come to the aid of their fallen comrade before all four felons can flee. Guards and convicts spring forward and backward out of cells, up and down stairs, and into and out of freedom.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lbZHAtnpKHEnHscDXNNKeVEzlhm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [163111, 184519, 162612, 77851], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
