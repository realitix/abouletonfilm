Their work became synonymous with campaigns to protect Tasmania's natural heritage. They shared many things, including a bond that was more like that of father and son. Both came from Baltic Europe and migrated to Tasmania, where their passion for nature became a crusade to save an environment under threat. Both died in the wilderness, doing what they loved, and left a legacy in extraordinary images. Their philosophy was simple and remarkably effective - if people could see the beauty of Australia's wild places then they might be moved to save them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uogHGefNXkyfmmZNFHdCzw4orRu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
