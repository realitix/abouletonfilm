The storyline was based on the play Ezredfordul\u00f3 (Turn of the Millennium) by Mikl\u00f3s Boldizs\u00e1r, who co-wrote the libretto.  The opera was first staged in 1983 on an open-air stage in Budapest. This first performance was also made into a 1984 film, directed by G\u00e1bor Koltay, and its music released on an album. The musical became a smash hit and is still very popular in Hungary and among Hungarian minorities in neighboring countries.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/te2cpF0VyYgT4rmL3KGP4hfG1TF.jpg", "actors": ["L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Pels\u0151czy (Istv\u00e1n)", "Mikl\u00f3s Varga (Istv\u00e1n (singing voice))", "Gyula Vikid\u00e1l (Kopp\u00e1ny)", "Katalin Berek (Sarolt)", "Bernadette S\u00e1ra (Gizella)", "M\u00e1t\u00e9 Victor (Asztrik)", "J\u00e1cint Juh\u00e1sz (Sebesty\u00e9n)", "Lajos Bal\u00e1zsovits (Vecellin)", "Gyula De\u00e1k Bill (Torda)", "Fer\u00f3 Nagy (Laborc)", "Ottilia Kov\u00e1cs (R\u00e9ka)", "M\u00e1rta Sebesty\u00e9n (R\u00e9ka (singing voice))", "P\u00e9ter Bal\u00e1zs (Bese)", "S\u00e1ndor S\u00f6r\u00f6s (Solt)", "S\u00e1ndor Szak\u00e1csi (Sur)", "Zsuzsa Nyertes (Bogl\u00e1rka)", "Br\u00f3dy J\u00e1nos (Reg\u0151s)", "S\u00e1ndor Halm\u00e1gyi (P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny)", "Zsolt K\u00f6rtv\u00e9lyessy (Hont)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
