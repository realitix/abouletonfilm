Dedicated to the portrait work of Paul C\u00e9zanne, the exhibition opens in Paris before traveling to London and Washington.  One can\u2019t appreciate 20th century art without understanding the significance and genius of Paul C\u00e9zanne. Featuring interviews with curators and experts from the National Portrait Gallery London, MoMA New York, National Gallery of Art Washington, and Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay Paris, and correspondence from the artist himself, the film takes audiences beyond the exhibition to the places C\u00e9zanne lived and worked and sheds light on an artist who is perhaps the least-known of all the impressionists \u2013 until now.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t8OnWhYqSPgyzC0izxligWprNOf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "P4L_0PUMeb8"}
