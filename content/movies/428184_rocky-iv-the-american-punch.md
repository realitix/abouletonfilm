Today, Rocky is held up as a model by some and is a subject of derision for others. An emblem of the 1980s, its culture and its heroes, the film will be the subject of an entertaining analysis of popular culture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/63mpwffWClrRZalSmzhVv35hp90.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Biskind (himself)", "Robert Chartoff (himself)", "Franco Columbu (himself)", "Vince DiCola (himself)", "Sylvain Dieuaide (narrator)", "Irwin Winkler (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
