Since childhood we'd been promised that the 21st century would bring us dramatic new technologies like flying cars and Utopian cities. Instead it bought us the smart-phone, social media, and virtual societies. And as it turns out these technologies began to transform society almost as dramatically as the moon colonies we'd been expecting.  Now over a decade into the revolution, 'DSKNECTD' explores how digital communication technology is profoundly changing the way we interact and experience each other - for the good and for the bad.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5TDISH219AIlYqIUiP7C7UhV9f.jpg", "actors": ["Daniel Chouinard (Dad)", "Christopher Cacciacarne (Jake)", "Adam Gazzaley (Himself)", "Jonathan Gratch (Himself)", "Mary Helen Immordino-Yang (Herself)", "Jacki Morie (Herself)", "Duane Osterlind (Himself)", "Eric R.W.
