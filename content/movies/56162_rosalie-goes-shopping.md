When the local shopkeepers no longer take her bad checks or bad credit cards, she's reduced to stealing from one family member to buy presents for others. It's looking pretty bleak until her daughter pushes her into buying a 'guilt gift' of a PC, complete with modem. Master shopper becomes master hacker, and Rosalie is back on top.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nsKTaoDUf4aAbvxyn6jGpyZhDWq.jpg", "actors": ["Marianne S\u00e4gebrecht (Rosalie Greenspace)", "Brad Davis (Ray 'Liebling' Greenspace)", "Judge Reinhold (The Priest)", "Erika Blumberger (Rosalie's Mother)", "Willy Harlander (Rosalie's Father)", "John Hawkes (Schnucki Greenspace)", "Patricia Zehentmayr (Barbara Greenspace)", "Courtney Kraus (April)", "Alex Winter (Schatzi Greenspace)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [63681, 84035, 162514, 78293], "youtube_key": "qkZFQjRZWxk"}
