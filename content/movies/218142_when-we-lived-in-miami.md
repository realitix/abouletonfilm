Using the real life storm to great effect, writer-director-star Amy Seimetz ('Sun Don't Shine,' ) crafts a simple yet haunting narrative that is deeply felt and powerfully realized. Co-starring AJ Bowen ('A Horrible Way to Die') and 5 year old new comer Fiona D'Avis, who turns in a heart rending performance, 'When We Lived in Miami' was shot on super 16 mm film by Jay Keitel ('Sun Don't Shine').", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uaExdrC5CYocwtrDnx4nd3MkDJO.jpg", "actors": ["Amy Seimetz ()", "AJ Bowen ()", "Fiona D'Avis ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
