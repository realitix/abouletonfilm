Due to loopholes in the law, Issei is a free man to this day.  Sagawa was declared insane and unfit for trial and was institutionalized in Paris. His incarceration was to be short, however, as the French public soon grew weary of their hard-earned francs going to support this evil woman-eater, and Issei was promptly deported. Herein followed a bizarre and seemingly too convenient set of legal loopholes and psychiatric reports that led doctors in Japan declaring him \"sane, but evil.\"  On August 12, 1986, Sagawa checked himself out of Tokyo's Matsuzawa Psychiatric hospital, and has been a free man ever since.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g4pXISxjvcRlGJPgiFJORKLn87o.jpg", "actors": ["Issei Sagawa (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
