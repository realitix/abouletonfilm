With its cat fights, hysterical tantrums, film noir lighting, and dramatic music, White Beast is indicative of the new influences of the Hollywood psychological thriller on Naruse. Caged (John Cromwell, 1950) initiated a cycle of women's prison movies in the United States that may or may not have been shown in Japan, but the stylistics of White Beast draw on the same paranoid woman's films and film noir conventions that preceded the American cycle.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3D8iPiKdrn280DHOdXRragVBXsG.jpg", "actors": ["Mitsuko Miura ()", "S\u00f4 Yamamura ()", "Eiji Okada ()", "Kimiko Iino ()", "Chieko Nakakita ()", "Mayuri Mokush\u00f4 ()", "Noriko Sengoku ()", "Masao Shimizu ()", "Tatsuya Ishiguro ()", "Taiz\u00f4 Fukami ()", "Fujio Nagahama ()", "Tanie Kitabayashi ()", "Y\u00fbko Matsui ()", "Yaeko Izumo ()", "Tsuruko Mano ()", "Haruko Ashida ()", "Hideko Yanoshima ()", "Mie As\u00f4 ()", "Haruko Toyama ()", "Chizuko Okamura ()", "Kinuko Kazami ()", "Yoko Ueno ()", "Aguri Hidaka ()", "Midori Shinma ()", "Chiyoko Hosokawa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
