The action, which is confined to the closed-off world of a family house and its grounds, with outside reality only impinging in the form of sounds and rumors, starts with a father murdering his daughter in an act of honor killing. With the complicity of his wife and son, he buries her corpse in the cellar. Family life continues, haunted by the shared knowledge of the murder across several generations. This conspiracy of silence and the film\u2019s exploration of the nature of complicity make for a powerful commentary on life in Iran, but Ayyari constructs his fable in such a fashion that ultimately it transcends nationality, culture, and religion and comes to depict the structure and inner workings of totalitarianism itself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/se4WniJIRPjsSdgFv9ZpU6S3s5l.jpg", "actors": ["Ainaz Azarhoush ()", "Nazanin Farahani ()", "Mojdeh Hamrang ()", "Mehdi Hashemi ()", "Naser Hashemi ()", "Shahab Hosseini ()", "Negah Khaghani ()", "Setareh Mirmohammad ()", "Moeinodin Oshaghi ()", "Padina Rahnama ()", "Mehran Rajabi ()", "Mina Sadati ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
