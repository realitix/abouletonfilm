Of their three sons, one committed suicide, one immigrated, and one ran away from home. The husband was once a two-star general with a promising future, but his decision not to join a coup d' tat would eventually lead to his dishonorable discharge and the loss of his pension. As the two grow older, they find an increasing sense of warmth and security in each other's presence. When one of their sons goes bankrupt, however, their house which they mortgaged to support him is take by the bank. With no social safety net to catch them, the two are forced to separate: the husband goes to a men's senior home while the wife ends up in a woman's home on the other side of the city. This painful separation forces the couple to find new means of communication, whether through letters or meeting in public parks. As month pass, the approaching winter promises harsh times ahead.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Nam Koong Won ()", "Lee Kyoung-hee ()", "Ma Hung-sik ()", "Kim Jeong-ha ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
