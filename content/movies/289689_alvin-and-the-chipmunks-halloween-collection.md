Alvin wants to be accepted into the Monster Club to get their cool Monster jacket, but the Monster members think it s cool to be cruel. It takes Theodore s friendship with Michael, a misunderstood outcast the other kids call Pumpkinhead, to show Alvin that being a true friend is really a lot more cool than trying to be a popular Monster! There are plenty of laughs and surprises -- and music, including the Chipmunks rendition of the hit song Monster Mash -- to make this a monstrously fun video any time of the year!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gnsS3ZPfCZ6GwQdgNqmfP5ITgji.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
