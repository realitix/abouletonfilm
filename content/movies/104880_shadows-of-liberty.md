The film takes an intrepid journey through the darker corridors of the American media landscape, where global media conglomerates exercise extraordinary political, social, and economic power. The overwhelming collective power of these firms raises troubling questions about democracy. Highly revealing interviews, actuality, and archive material, tell insider accounts of a broken media system, where journalists are prevented from pursuing controversial news stories, people are censored for speaking out against abuses of government power, and individual lives are shattered as the arena for public expression has been turned into a private profit zone", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1cv8pRtM4fT1uFnwr2gc9BXmiwz.jpg", "actors": ["Julian Assange (Himself)", "Danny Glover (Himself)", "Charlie Rose (Himself - PBS talk-show host (archive footage))", "David Simon (Himself)", "Barack Obama (Himself - US President (archive footage))", "Joe Biden (Himself - US Vice President (archive footage))", "Al Gore (Himself - former US Vice President (archive footage))", "Sean Hannity (Himself - FoxNews talk-show host (archive footage))", "Bill Clinton (Himself - former US President (archive footage))", "Dick Gregory (Himself - Comedian / Activist)", "Rupert Murdoch (Himself - CEO of NewsCorp (archive footage))"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "pmchanjr", "content": "Speaking truth to power is a dangerous game not to be played by the faint-of-heart.  I remain unconvinced that any among us would sacrifice power for truth; it is and always will be the fundamental flaw of human nature.
