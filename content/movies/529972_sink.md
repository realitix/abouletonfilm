He takes a course of action that is completely out of character, but it\u2019s the only way he can see of keeping his family together. It is about surviving, but it\u2019s not all anguish and despair - it\u2019s also warm and tender, and funny. It's about people finding their way through. It\u2019s about Micky Mason; a man out there, right now, doing his best.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jP2LN6gd5JFMO7FJtLm19rSCAvj.jpg", "actors": ["Martin Herdman (Micky)", "Ian Hogg (Sam)", "Marlene Sidaway (Jean)", "Tracey Wilkinson (Lorraine)", "Josh Herdman (Jason)", "Mark Gillis (Paul)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ZrkzWeJd7HI"}
