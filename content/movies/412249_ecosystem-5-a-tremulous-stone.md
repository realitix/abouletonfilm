Through the series, Koike has shot a huge amount \u2013 thousands \u2013 of still photos of objective motifs, from ocean creatures, microbes, and granite to artificial material such as fishing nets. Those photos are developed with a specialized method then reshot with movie film. The style has been thoroughly continued. The images that are created as a result tower before our eyes as an overwhelming visual experience. Each motif has been repeatedly decomposed and reconstructed of its \"attribution\" and \"meaning\", causing a shocking Gestalt breakdown for the audience.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3OKmUZZjnab1TKNzJMESVAroZPt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
