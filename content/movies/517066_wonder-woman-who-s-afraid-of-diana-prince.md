Diana lives with her mother close to a United States Air Force base. Much of the film consists of her mother berating Diana about not having a boyfriend. When her mother leaves the room, Diana changes into her Wonder Woman costume and admires her reflection in a mirror. What she sees is not Diana Prince, but rather a sexy super-heroic figure (played by Linda Harrison) who proceeds to preen and pose as the song \"Oh, You Beautiful Doll\" plays on the soundtrack.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pTuKKZcgFkvCpM1CeeYCODh3rxd.jpg", "actors": ["Ellie Wood Walker (Diana Prince/Wonder Woman)", "Maudie Prickett (Diana's Mother)", "Linda Harrison (Wonder Woman's Reflection)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
