As the day progressed, hundreds of people set up tents and turned the art gallery plaza into an encampment equipped with a first-aid station, media tent, a functioning kitchen and a library. This sudden occupation of public property in the middle of downtown Vancouver was followed closely by the media and remained a spectacle for 39 days. The Occupation follows the movement through the lives of those living at the Occupy Vancouver encampment. BCIT journalism students Rafferty Baker and Matthew J. Van Deventer documented the rise and fall of Occupy Vancouver from the pitching of the first tent to the occupants forced exodus.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
