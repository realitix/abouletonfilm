One of them is a college football player, the other is a man named David. David asks Jim if he can invite a grubby mechanic named Kevin to come with him, and Jim reluctantly agrees. What follows is a consistent pattern of Jim ignoring Kevin, in favor of the more wealthy, attractive, and talented people around him. What Jim doesn't know that David is an angel, sent by God.
