The story begins with young scriptwriter Fran\u00e7ois tracking down the author of a once-scandalous novel. His aim is to adapt the work for the screen but several elements of the novel he finds difficult to comprehend. The author, Jeanne, is initially cautious of relaying information, insisting the presumably autobiographical book in no way relates to her personal life. However, eventually she takes the man into confidence to tell the background of Benvenuta.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ljRHQkaYDypCHScha42kA7PMzvX.jpg", "actors": ["Fanny Ardant (Benvenuta)", "Vittorio Gassman (Livio)", "Fran\u00e7oise Fabian (Jeanne)", "Mathieu Carri\u00e8re (Francois)", "Claire Wauthion (Inge)", "Philippe Geluck (La p\u00e8re)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
