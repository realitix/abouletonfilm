Dawn's struggle with her past is played out not only upon the couch during regression therapy but also within the family home. With the help of Josh's method of escapism; a penchant for viewing life through a lens, we learn from his footage the extent and impact this situation has had over the years. Vulnerable and unable to articulate their worries, teenagers Josh &amp; Nicola struggle with their mum's more recent bout of outbursts and her increasing instability. They forge relationships outside of the family unit; to escape in Nicola's case and for support whilst they try to maintain some sense of a 'normal' existence. As relationships at home become frayed, suspicions about Dawn's therapist's integrity &amp; motivations arise. Dawn is sectioned and social services are informed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ovVTnbXm1bgNORyrhNwz2oL5cMM.jpg", "actors": ["Janet Bamford (Dawn)", "Daniel Booth (Josh)", "James Devlin (Dave)", "Neil Ely (Jonno)", "Lyn Eyre-Morgan (Dr. Carlson)", "Coby Hamilton (Chrissy)", "Kiyrha Hayden (School Girl)", "Jody Latham (Barnsey)", "Kathryn McColl (Joanne)", "Ryan Pope (Karl, Dawn's Father)", "Tom Ryan (Teacher)", "Olivia Sweeney (Nicola)", "Joe Watts (Mikey)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
