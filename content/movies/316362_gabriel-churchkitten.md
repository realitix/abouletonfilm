The Parson repeatedly rises up, in a fit of sleepwalking, and reaches the cupboard, while muttering the need to feed the \"churchkitten\" and \"churchmouse,\" but then proceeds to drink the milk and eat the cheese himself. Eventually, the kitten and mouse enlist the aid of a neighboring puppy named Trumpet to achieve their goal.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jackson Beck (Pastor (voice))", "Mae Questel (Peter (voice))", "Cecil Roy (Gabriel Churchkitten (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
