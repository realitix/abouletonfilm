Although the two compatriots both live in the capital, Caracas, and both love music, they have a need to go out into the rest of the country and discover their roots. As big-city dwellers, they are limited in their perspectives, though this excursion into other areas of Venezuela may prove more illuminating to them than to a foreign audience.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
