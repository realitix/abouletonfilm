She has been making this commute for 6 years, totaling 600 trips, or \u2013 put another way \u2013 Jessica has spent 4 months riding the bus back and forth.  Challenging standard approaches to documentary filmmaking, Not Bad at All focuses on Jessica\u2019s relationship with her 87-year-old father Aloysius in a way most viewers would categorize as experimental narrative fiction. This formal tension helps Billy and Jessica (as filmmakers/subjects) explore the complexities of family, memory, and those strange in-between spaces that we all navigate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nZNvUGtGWExcNZrUq6qG2AIDjLg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
