The inimitable overture is (mercifully) unstaged and terrifically played, with splendid cello and flute solos: the fine standard never flags. Rossini\u2019s extraordinary 1829 score audibly presages Meyerbeer, Berlioz, Glinka, Verdi and Wagner, among many others. Graham Vick\u2019s direction privileges class conflict, with a clenched fist on the red-and-white forecurtain. The Edwardian costumes place Austrians in white evening garb; the black-clad Swiss polish the floor while the rulers savor a filming (much of that to follow) \u2014 the fisherman Ruodi, in a boat with a blonde and fake scenery, with Tell and his family providing tech support. Vick deploys geographical and historical kitsch liberally but not (always) pointlessly. Ron Howell\u2019s pretentious, mannered choreography, however, beggars belief.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/odhjkHxz3wqeCTxSqxXa1EJuVSV.jpg", "actors": ["Nicola Alaimo (Guillaume Tell)", "Simone Alberghini (Melcthal)", "Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez (Arnold)", "Amanda Forsythe (Jemmy)", "Sim\u00f3n Orfila (Walter Furst)", "Marina Rebeka (Mathilde)", "Luca Tittoto (Gessler)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
