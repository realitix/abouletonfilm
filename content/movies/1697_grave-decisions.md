He's convinced that he killed his mother on the day he was born and is certain he's already been condemned to purgatory. Deciding he might be able to knock off a few years of his sentence by doing good deeds, Sebastian sets out to find a wife for his father Lorenz. When Lorenz and Sebastian's schoolteacher Veronika fall madly in love with each other, it seems the heavens must be smiling. There's just one hitch: Veronika is married.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ywzCOgNP9vfwQvgion1zqaOEfL.jpg", "actors": ["Markus Krojer (Sebastian)", "Fritz Karl (Lorenz)", "Jule Ronstedt (Veronika Dorstreiter)", "J\u00fcrgen Tonkel (Alfred Dorstreiter)", "Franz Xaver Br\u00fcckner (Franz)", "Saskia Vester (Frau Kramer)", "Hans Schuler (Sepp Graudinger)", "Sepp Schauer (Proske)", "Pia Lautenbacher (Evi)", "Klaus Steinbacher (Toni)", "Heinz-Josef Braun (Gumberger)", "Tim Seyfi (Irmengard)", "Johanna Bittenbinder (Mutter in der Sprechstunde)", "Monika Manz (Kassiererin)", "Stefanie von Poser (Mutter Sebastian)", "Konstantin Wecker (Herr Bl\u00fcml)", "Maximilian Br\u00fcckner (Verk\u00e4ufer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [11405, 1736, 90108, 9596], "youtube_key": "KeUChkNyQ2k"}
