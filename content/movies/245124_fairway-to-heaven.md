Surrounded by an (to say the least) unlikely group of assorted hangers-on and supporters, such as a lesbian golf instructor, an ex-girlfriend-turned-nemesis and an annoying caddy who'd be more at home on a surfboard, Tripp somehow manages to make the Tour. It's only then that the two drop-dead gorgeous, bikini-clad, space-gun-wielding aliens appear.  At times hilarious, at other times merely ridiculous, Fairway to Heaven tries to be Caddyshack, but too often more closely resembles Porky's.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aAuhTOVyvBzLivJ3UeFFoBfERYb.jpg", "actors": ["Ryan Click (Donny Chain)", "Ryan Tower (Bradd Tripp)", "Akira Lane (Bambie)", "Dylan Diehl (Nikki)", "Meredith Grau (Lezzie)", "Charlotte J.
