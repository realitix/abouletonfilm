This DVD is dedicated to the captive bred Harris' Hawk, the hawk that made such journeys and pleasures possible. Selective breeding has refined this group-hunting species into a well-oiled machine, with the hawk enjoying the hunt and its successes every bit as much as the falconer. We thank this phenomenon, unprecedented in American falconry, for bringing us together to hunt a most worthy quarry.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/40HP5KoAKxnOrViv9DHGpThToMv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
