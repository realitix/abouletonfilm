In her neighbourhood the women do not all wear veils, the men do not rattle off empty political slogans, the young people do not strap bombs to their belts, and the children play together like kids everywhere. Taking us into the daily existence of Soraida, her family and neighbours, the film compels us to ask fundamental questions about life in the Middle East.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ddvHLYympmVS2TYeMupHEt1TYHD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
