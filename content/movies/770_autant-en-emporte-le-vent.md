I have always wished it had been a series with this cast instead of a movie. Futile wishes!\r\n\r\nThe casting, to begin with, is very well matched to the book's spirit if not the physical descriptions. Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Olivia de Havilland and Hattie McDaniel. I stop here and will edit it bit by bit to complete it in a few days. It is too large to finish in one writing."}], "recommandations_id": [289, 826, 947, 665], "youtube_key": "3AaSdZvetuY"}
