The central idea of this short experimental film is the practise and significance of wig-wearing in Nollywood film; a practise the director has invested with deeper psychological as well as science-fiction layers. Underpinning this central idea however is a critique of the unforgiving treatment of single women in Nollywood and Nigeria. The film is an example of what the director, Zina Saro-Wiwa, has termed \u201calt-Nollywood\u201d, a genre that plays with and reworks certain narrative, stylistic and visual conventions of Nollywood. Phyllis explores the gothic possibilities of the Nollywood aesthetic creating a new kind of low-budget atmospheric film that is very much of Nollywood and yet subverts the genre. Using Nollywood to subvert Nollywood.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/id9KDYctwFyQR3W8mWzInaiYRgZ.jpg", "actors": ["Olushola Adeyinka (Phyllis)", "Gboyega Babajide (Man on Staircase)", "Opeyemi Fajemirokun (Victim)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
