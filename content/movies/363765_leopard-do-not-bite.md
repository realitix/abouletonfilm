While no one dares to kill in accordance with the monk\u2019s teachings, the lone hunter hunts and provides meat for everyone. Meanwhile, beautiful villager Gomari is killed by a leopard, but no one knows this. Suspecting what happened to Gomari, the hunter begs the monk to cancel the upcoming full moon rituals, but the monk refuses, believing in the inevitability of fate. The hunter that never kills unless absolutely necessary must now hunt alone for the leopard that will attack humans.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/68iWaDopBUtfP1g0kmgHiBI3rG0.jpg", "actors": ["Sanjeewa Upendra (Hunter)", "Hemasiri Liyanage (Monk)", "Christina Britto (Gomaree)", "Prasanna Jayakody ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "8CpI5hHnwDY"}
