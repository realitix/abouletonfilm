Albert Uy is on the verge of an amazing discovery in the Solomon Islands, but there's a threat looming on the horizon. The islands' resources are being exploited, putting all local wildlife at risk. It's a race against time to gather the evidence necessary to prove the existence of a new species before it's lost forever.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dCz254BrCyFLsVMiAB2UAuMGfrT.jpg", "actors": ["\u200cJ.
