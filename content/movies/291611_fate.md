Ten years later, an older, wiser Paul has picked up some talent, but it's still outweighed by sheer nerve. In Fate, Paul casts himself as the last of the truly nice guys (or so he regards himself). He has his future all planned, specifically an ideal marriage to the perfect woman. The next step is to find that woman.
