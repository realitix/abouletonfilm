Poo arrives at the one-man Aida Detective Agency with the Delta Mazelan 'F' Series hardware. A dragon fish has been stolen by Tetsu Tobiyama and biologist Thomas Earwing seeks its return (the Super-Red variety is worth 10 million yen). The system fails to provide info about Tetsu, but Poo worms her way into a top secret file at Delta headquarters, finding that he supplies trained assassins for use worldwide. Searching tropical fish outlets where Tobiyama shops for supplies, Poo is led to Natsuro, living alone with fish tanks, one of which contains a dragon fish. This enigmatic young man is not only mysteriously attractive to Poo, he also seems to attract the attention of hit men aimed at him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kxqmnpilw4zDEOW6tJKkA7Lr9tl.jpg", "actors": ["Miyoko Yoshimoto (Poo Rinwon)", "Tadanobu Asano (Natsuro)", "Hiroshi \u00d4guchi ()", "Hajime Yamazaki ()", "Ken Mitsuishi ()", "Tomoro Taguchi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
