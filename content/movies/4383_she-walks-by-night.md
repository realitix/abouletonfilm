The history of the case of Rosemarie, a hooker, and how she came to be strangled in her apartment is not completely clear. One of the suspects in the case was first charged, later acquitted, but never really free of an aura of culpability. British actress Belinda Lee plays the title role with her voice dubbed over in German.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A7ViOQtmIdGKJefju33zc8v9ykb.jpg", "actors": ["Belinda Lee (Rosemarie Nitribitt)", "Walter Rilla (Alexander Woltikoff, Gesch\u00e4ftsmann)", "Karl Lieffen (Zuh\u00e4lter)", "Claus Wilcke (Fred Guttberg, Pelzverk\u00e4ufer)", "Jan Hendriks (Heinz Pohlmann, ein Freund)", "Paul Dahlke (Reimer)", "Hans Nielsen (Bernbeill)", "Karl Sch\u00f6nb\u00f6ck (von Riedendank)", "Lina Carstens (Frau Huber)", "Annette Grau (Giesela)", "Hanna Micaela (Frau auf der Stra\u00dfe)", "Wolfgang B\u00fcttner (Andreas Guttberg, Polizeipsychologe)", "Paul B\u00f6s (Freier beim Tanz)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
