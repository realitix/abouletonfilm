That\u2019s when she first took up running, after raising her four children. Joy would go on to run 25 New York City Marathons, the last in 2013 at the age of 86. This film uses evocative footage and Joy\u2019s own words to tell the story of this remarkable woman, who was born on Christmas Day in 1926 and inspired us all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nWHSHc79UVoTNXNzrvRrKQxPLG0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
