Interesting back projections, lasers and generic lights will be an entertaining addition whether you've seen the show live or watch it for the first time via your home cinema. Good old \"hits\" by TD will be alternated and supported by some brand-new stuff composed for the gig. Images from backstage and 'making of' sequences can be seen as a summary of a great \"night at space\" including the safe and comfortable landing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ruWyn32BHT1ZKa7yeScOMF5XRQ7.jpg", "actors": ["Edgar Froese (Himself)", "Iris Camaa (Percussions)", "Linda Spa (Flute, sax, Keyboards)", "Throsten Quaeschning (Synths, Keyboards)", "Bernhard Beibl (Keyboards, guitar)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
