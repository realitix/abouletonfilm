By 1656, he is bankrupt but consoles himself with the company of pretty maid Hendrickje, whom he's unable to marry. Their relationship brings ostracism but also some measure of happiness. The final scenes find him in his last year, 1669, physically enfeebled but his spirit undimmed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tPWpKQeMxuLQpNf0V1ImnMlWWTP.jpg", "actors": ["Charles Laughton (Rembrandt)", "Gertrude Lawrence (Geertje Dirx)", "Elsa Lanchester (Hendrickje Stoffels)", "Raymond Huntley (Ludwick)", "Edward Chapman (Fabrizius)", "Walter Hudd (Capt.
