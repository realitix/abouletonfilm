James and John haven\u2019t spoken in ten years; John is now a thrusting executive with a wandering eye, James, a lonely, socially maladjusted, alcoholic. It\u2019s only the sudden death of the father who rejected them as children, that draws them back together. Their father\u2019s letters and the people they meet, start to heal old wounds, helping them come to terms with the pains of both past and present, but there is a secret waiting five hundred miles north in the highlands that could shatter them forever.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Joseph Morgan (James Hogg)", "Matt Ryan (John Hogg)", "Wendy Glenn (Sassy)", "Vanessa Branch (Claire)", "Sue Johnston (Stein)", "Scott Ainslie (Policeman)", "John Milroy (Ghillie)", "Leon Davis (Traveller)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
