The nature of the miracle is a bit strange, but it comes in answer to Pater Malachias' prayers to get the sin-ridden place out of the center of the city. The good and naive Malachias is subtly played by Horst Bollimann. Once this miracle of relocation has occurred, the sharks and entrepreneurs, who would bilk both the faithful and the curiosity-seekers alike, crop up like an unwanted epidemic. The mercenary and the sacred clash, as many try to find deeper meaning in what has happened, and Pater Malachias starts to doubt the wisdom of his original prayer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2mIKdBghhQrpnvCokteYCyMu7WI.jpg", "actors": ["Horst Bollmann (Pater Malachias)", "Richard M\u00fcnch (Dr. Erwin Glass)", "Christiane Nielsen (Helga Glass)", "G\u00fcnter Pfitzmann (Rudolf Reuschel)", "Brigitte Grothum (Gussy)", "Pinkas Braun (Christian Kr\u00fcger)", "G\u00fcnter Strack (Kaplan Merz)", "Vicco von B\u00fclow (Kauziger Professor)", "Senta Berger (Yvonne Kr\u00fcger)", "Charlotte Kerr (Dr. Renate Kellinghus)", "Wolfgang Spier (Herr Littmann)", "Walter Buschhoff (Kripo-Beamter)", "Friedrich Sch\u00fctter (Fotograf)", "G\u00fcnter Meisner (Prediger)", "Sigrid von Richthofen (Gr\u00e4fin)", "Paul Edwin Roth ()", "Hans Helmut Dickow (Specht)", "Karin H\u00fcbner (Nelly Moorbach)", "Romuald Pekny (Legat)", "Ellen Umlauf ()", "Heinz Lieven (Polizeireferent)", "Herbert Stass (Arbeiter)", "Renate Schacht ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
