A man of many contradictions, he was known\r as 'The Quiet One', although Monty Python's Eric Idle once remarked, George never stopped talking. The melancholy one who\r had a great sense of humour, the simple spiritual man who had a passion for motor racing and enjoyed his immense wealth.  This programme explores his complex nature and his life journey with interviews with those that were the closest to him,  and using rare film footage we examine his undoubted musical talent, his time with The Beatles and his long held spiritual  beliefs that were a comfort to him until his untimely death at just 58 years old in November 2001.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iTfDXlD7rjj0aQ1yKtljpw4m0Op.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
