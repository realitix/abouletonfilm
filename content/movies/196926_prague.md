One note dominates the narration, that of continuity between past and present, and also the camerawork -- contrived to be as artful and art filled as the narration. Modern and ancient architecture and other cultural attributes of Prague, including scenes from the stage play Amadeus serve as a backdrop to the lecture on the nature of Prague history -- a non-stop \"continuity of consciousness.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ed6zjJ404nwdzcMDsvNZCK9WQF9.jpg", "actors": ["Alan Cumming ()", "Sandrine Bonnaire ()", "Bruno Ganz ()", "Raphael Meiss ()", "Henri Meiss ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
