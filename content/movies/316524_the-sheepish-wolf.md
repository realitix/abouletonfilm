The baby sheep doesn't have anyone else, so he follows the wolf around. The wolf is annoyed with the sheep shadow at first, but they soon become friends. The hungry wolf tries to sneak past the sheepdog. Then he gets himself hired by the farmer (who \"seems\" to be dumb) by coming up with the zaniest of excuses when he keeps getting caught with another sheep! The farmer does have the last laugh!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
