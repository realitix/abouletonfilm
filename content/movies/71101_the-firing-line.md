It's useful for growing film-lovers to see hideously-composed scenes and stupid lines, to see what not to do, and to get those wheels spinning in their minds, as to how they would have done something much better.\r\n\r\nThere is much to howl at here. Pivotal cheese of the finest vintage is a scene, in the midst of a Central American country in the chaotic times of civil war--yet Shannon Tweed and Reb Brown strip and neck by a scenic waterfall, and she goes down to give him a blowjob. Great timing. Anyways, there's an hour-and-a-half like that, with something for everybody--especially if you enjoy better-made films from the era like 'Commando'. You could be doing far worse--such as arthouse-wannabes like Lena Dunham's 'Tiny Furniture'..."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ScAnWceIqhg"}
