Irene takes a working trip to Cairo and returns invigorated with the swell of success. She sets out again and never returns. What follows is both predictable and unpredictable. Aurel, and the audience, are suspicious of the official explanation of her death so the foundation is laid for the traditional who-dunnit. Aurel proceeds on an emotional search against all odds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8P70Ob1GMhYOWxULeCaRWxlCJ5Z.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ayJxtXLb7KA"}
