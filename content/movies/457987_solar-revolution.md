We are in the midst of a dramatic rise in solar disturbances, which have the capability of disrupting the Earth's geomagnetic field and, as a result, our global ecology. Broers, however, sees this not as an impending apocalypse but as the dawn of a new era. Drawing on research from a variety of disciplines, he shows how erupting solar activity carries the potential to boost our brain capacity and expand our minds in ways we never imagined possible. Humankind is going through an evolutionary leap, says Broers, and the process has already begun.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k3TWCcpT6R1zqhxWoluOvpKGkan.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
