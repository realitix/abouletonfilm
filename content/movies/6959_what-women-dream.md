Strangely, every time she steals something, a mysterious man pays for it. A clumsy detective begins investigating and finds a crucial clue: a strongly scented woman's glove. The perfume is an expensive scent and the detective's pal realizes that it belongs to a popular nightclub singer. The friend quickly becomes enamored of the girl, but then so does her mystery man, a notorious international criminal. Eventually he gets arrested, leaving the detective's pal to move in on the singer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iD1U2efUvTr6uPMcSeknfR27ZXM.jpg", "actors": ["Nora Gregor (Rina Korff)", "Gustav Fr\u00f6hlich (Walter K\u00f6nig)", "Otto Wallburg (Kleinsilber)", "Peter Lorre (Otto Fuessli)", "Kurt Horwitz (Levassor alias John Constantinescu)", "Lya Christy (-)", "Erik Ode (-)", "Carl Auen (-)", "Eric Steinbeck (-)", "Kurt Lilien (-)", "Hilde Maroff (-)", "Eric Helgar (-)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
