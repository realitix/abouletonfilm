The punning title refers to a well-stocked rural fishing stream, which sparks a battle royale between two rival groups of fishermen. Brigadier-General Sir Donald Rowley (Tom Walls) gets involved in the fray when he rents a country cottage with his nephew Sydney (Ralph Lynn). While the nephew pitches woo at the local maidens, General Rowley adopts military tactics to reclaim the stream from village squire Duck (J. Robertson Hare).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rjLXSKozB6wIAcaZitR9zmRvTfZ.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Walls (Brig. Gen.
