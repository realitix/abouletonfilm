Edgar, Windy Window and Ruffy, are organizing a party. (Shh! It's a secret.) Everything is going along just perfectly until J. Edgar trips and loses the last five magical balloons in all of Lovelyloveville--OH NO! The Oogiloves set out to find the magical balloons in time to save their friend's party. Along the way, they meet some very interesting characters indeed, including Dotty Rounder (Cloris Leachman), Bobby Wobbly (Carey Elwes), Milky Marvin (Chazz Palminteri), Rosalie Rosebud (Toni Braxton) and Lola and Lero Sombero (Christopher Lloyd and Jaime Pressly). Can these new friends help them recover the magical balloons and get back to the cottage in time to celebrate Schluufy's surprise birthday?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gcqLA6WyfM6F07UjJI2OOrBCwGm.jpg", "actors": ["Christopher Lloyd (Lero Sombrero)", "Cary Elwes (Bobby Wobbly)", "Jaime Pressly (Lola)", "Cloris Leachman (Dotty Rounder)", "Chazz Palminteri (Marvin Milkshake)", "Toni Braxton (Rosalie Rosebud)", "Maya Stange (Windy Window)", "Garrett Clayton (Diner dancer (as Gary Clayton))", "Nick Drago (J.
