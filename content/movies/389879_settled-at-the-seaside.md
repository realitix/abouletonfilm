A young man proposes to his gal. She accepts, and promptly tells him to re-tie his tie. He objects, so she returns the ring and walks away. An older couple has their own squabble: the middle-aged husband, who thinks himself a dandy, is happy to see his complaining wife roll away in a small, unattended carriage. He immediately approaches the younger woman. To make her ex-fianc\u00e9 jealous, she takes up with the dandy and off they go to swim. What of the wife and the jilted beau? Can things be set right?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Charley Chase (Boyfriend)", "Mae Busch (Girlfriend)", "Fritz Schade (Husband)", "Gladys Brockwell (Wife)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
