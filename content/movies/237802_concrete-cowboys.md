Claude Akins is also on hand while several country stars are featured in bit parts (Barbara Mandrell, Ray Stevens, etc.).\r\n\r\nThis was the 1979 pilot movie for an unrealized series, also known as \u201cRamblin\u2019 Man.\u201d Country singer-turned-actor Reed, known for the Smokey and the Bandit flicks, was the leading man while Selleck only appeared in this pilot, which is strange because this movie gives the impression that they\u2019re an ongoing team.\r\n\r\nThe two leads are entertaining and the pedestrian detective story is relatively compelling. Ray Stevens performs live and it\u2019s a highlight. Meanwhile the striking Fairchild was hot stuff at the time. This is TV fare from that era not far removed from, say, The Fall Guy series or the Smokey and the Bandit flicks.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 31 minutes and was shot in Nashville.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+/B-"}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
