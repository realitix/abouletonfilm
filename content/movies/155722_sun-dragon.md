Once there, he runs into a group of men who terrorize the town and extort the local businesses. Meanwhile, a trio of three bank robbers need a place to hide until the heat dies down from a recent heist. They pick the home of a black farming family and subsequently kill them, leaving only the severly injured eldest son Tommy (Carl Scott) to escape. Tommy is found by Chong and Kum and is brought to the home of Doctor Ko (Leung Siu-Chung), who heals his injuries. Eventually Tommy learns kung fu from Ko, and sets out for payback. Luckily for Tommy, Chong is also bent on revenge after the bandits hire the local troublemakers and some Japanese samurai to kill him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iYQ2M0f78XkFHQUDADjo8uAoMik.jpg", "actors": ["Billy Chong ()", "Carl Scott ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
