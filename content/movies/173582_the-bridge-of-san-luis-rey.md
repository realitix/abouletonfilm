It is a straight-forward telling of the intermingled lives of a group of strangers doomed to die in a collapsing bridge accident. The Art Direction, paltry and unremarkable, surprisingly won an Oscar over the far more remarkable work nominated in THE IRON MASK. The special effect scene of the lovers plummeting with the bridge into the chasm is unforgettable and remarkably done.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tTD21ahgGAyTme8hMPojv0fyPE2.jpg", "actors": ["Lili Damita (Camila (La Perichole))", "Ernest Torrence (Uncle Pio)", "Raquel Torres (Pepita)", "Don Alvarado (Manuel)", "Duncan Renaldo (Esteban)", "Henry B.
