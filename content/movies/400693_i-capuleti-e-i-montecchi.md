Joyce DiDonato, winner of the Grammy Award and the ECHO Klassik, and Nicole Cabell as the ill-fated lovers Romeo and Giulietta headline a cast of international stars. Directed by Vincent Boussard in his U.S. debut and led by returning conductor and bel canto specialist Riccardo Frizza, this new co-production has sets created by French opera, theater and dance designer Vincent Lemaire. The production also features stunning costumes by renowned fashion designer Christian Lacroix, a frequent collaborator with Mr. Boussard and a prominent fashion icon known for both his couture house as well as his theater, ballet and opera costumes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oWO1OpTFZ3AFfXH0NQ4lx4CKCiw.jpg", "actors": ["Joyce DiDonato (Romeo)", "Nicole Cabell (Giulietta)", "Saimir Pirgu (Tebaldo)", "Eric Owens (Capellio)", "Ao Li (Lorenzo)", "Riccardo Frizza (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
