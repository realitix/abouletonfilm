In this inaugural episode a group of young actors inhabit an empty apartment, their behavior taped and edited in-camera. An analog solarization technique captures their rituals of improvised dance, frozen poses and trimming of hair. Each cast member recounts painful personal life episodes that unfold like cheap sci-fi stories of otherworldly abductions, familial vanishings, strange dreams and reptilian passions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/asdx86bnYHvPehycZLBtM9SdshX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
