The stories -- created by five different screenwriters, including Eric Bogosian, Richard Price, and Longo himself -- are mostly loosely structured attempts at satirizing the neuroses and eccentricities of members of Lower Manhattan's art community.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tt6ycLrgGvuANdxchQIPPeyKYL7.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Stipe (The Watcher)", "Eric Bogosian (The Entertainer)", "Ray Liotta (The Artist)", "Richard Price (The Critic)", "Richard Schiff (Deli Man)", "Sean Young (Artist)", "Steve Buscemi (Wired Kid #1)", "Mark Boone Junior (Boyfriend)", "Ron Vawter (Man with Cigar)", "Anne DeSalvo (Successful Woman #1)", "Jodi Long (Successful Woman #2)", "Jessica Cardinale (Woman in Black Suit)", "Emily Prager (Lone Woman)", "Allyson Suprenant (Drunken Woman)", "Ginger Garrett (Yuppie)", "Donna Lupie (Punk in Rubber Dress)", "Dana Daffer (Tourist #1)", "Heather Pleasants (Tourist #2)", "Wm.
