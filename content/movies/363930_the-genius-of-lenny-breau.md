Long before the term \"fusion\" was coined, Lenny was melting musical boundaries to produce original pieces that borrowed from styles as diverse as jazz, classical and flamenco. Through a combination of never-before-seen archival footage and interviews with family and colleagues, viewers are offered a close-up look at a sensitive, selfless but flawed musical genius who redefined what the guitar could do.  - Telefilm Canada", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r5QlZTnDKErSp7Yl5KAk9FJAZY4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
