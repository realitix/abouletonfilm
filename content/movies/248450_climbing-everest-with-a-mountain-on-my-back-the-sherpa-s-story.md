But of that number, nearly half were Sherpas - the mountain's unsung heroes. Yet the Sherpa community has remained secretive about their nation, culture and experiences living in the shadow of the world's highest mountain. Now, for the first time, they open the door into their world.  Without the expertise of the Sherpas, only the hardiest and most skilful climbers would succeed. Every day they risk their lives for the safety of others, yet they seek neither glory nor reward, preferring to stay in the background. Following the stories of four such Sherpas - Phurba, Ngima, Ngima Tenji and Gelu - this film reveals the reality of their daily lives, not just up the mountain, but with their families after they return home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m9KRQZracCkLhNgg1b0l7aAlAmk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
