With the central image of the statue of Saint Teresa of Avila in Rome, together with glimpses of colour-saturated flower gardens, the Crucifixion and Baroque plasterwork, we listen to the gulping and frenetically clipped voice of the \u2018saint\u2019 pouring out her rapturous lament, attempting to express the unsayable. The film\u2019s soundtrack combines a spoken voice by Nina Danino and performed vocals by New York experimental singer Shelley Hirsch.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qiiCadSdeW4a2OIYj9lbYDuLgPT.jpg", "actors": ["Nina Danino ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
