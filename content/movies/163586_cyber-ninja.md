What's left becomes Cyber Ninja. He teams up with the chi students whose cyber-earmuffs show matching red symbols. They fill their swords with ammunition, grab some neo-retro-cyber-antique guns and attack the demon robot expendable ninja squad. Each fight is won by whichever side uses more gratuitous special effects. They slay the Tron-like hover droids, who are destroyed in their shame. There's a showdown with a white-armored guy with dreadlocks, who is later reincarnated by the eclipse and a lot of multicolored lightning. After killing the make-up wearing effeminate spider person, the chi school fires a giant gun at the demon castle spider cyber robot. It blows up.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vptKBlraeidlPNqnfMfQ0NG58Pw.jpg", "actors": ["Hanbei Kawai (Akagi)", "Hiroko Ida (Jiromaru)", "Eri Morishita (Princess Saki)", "Makoto Yokoyama (Shiranui)", "Fuyukichi Maki (Kajiwara)", "Sh\u00f4hei Yamamoto (Raimei Dark Bishop)", "Mizuho Yoshida (Shoki)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [52882, 27439], "youtube_key": "ByH8BGI6hQA"}
