With fresh filming and new interviews, along with a treasure trove of rare archive, the film presents the inside story of giant personalities who make today's public figures look sadly dull in comparison.  The well-known journalist revisits some of his films on the big characters who helped shaped the 1970s in Britain. Both tragic and comic, it highlights just how much our world has changed in four decades.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Michael Cockerell (Himself - Presenter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
