As Jerry Golding (Thomas) scales the heights of show business, he breaks the heart of his father (Eduard Franz), who'd hoped that Jerry would follow in his footsteps. Sorrowfully, Cantor Golding reads the Kaddish service, indicating that, so far as he is concerned, his son is dead. A tearful reconciliation (and a more upbeat denouement than was found in the original film) occurs when Jerry dutifully returns to sing the \"Kol Nidre\" in his ailing father's absence. Peggy Lee co-stars as Judy Lane, a musical comedy entertainer who falls in love with Jerry, while Mildred Dunnock and Alex Gerry do what they can with the stereotyped roles of Jerry's mother and uncle, respectively.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u1ybrnSgK5XT1HRiB5ieRyLTXrg.jpg", "actors": ["Danny Thomas (Jerry Golding)", "Peggy Lee (Judy Lane)", "Eduard Franz (David Golding)", "Mildred Dunnock (Ruth Golding)", "Alex Gerry (Uncle Louie)", "Allyn Joslyn (George Miller)", "Tom Tully (Dan McGurney)", "Harold Gordon (Rabbi Roth)", "Hal Ross (Joseph)", "Justin Smith (Phil Stevens)", "Murray Alper (Taxi Driver (uncredited))", "Bess Flowers (Party Guest / Nightclub Extra (uncredited))", "William Schallert (Assistant Stage Manager (uncredited))", "Anitra Stevens (Yvonne)", "Marcoreta Hellman (Mrs. Robbins)", "Gayne Whitman (Mr. Eskow)", "Anthony Jochim (Mr. Michton)", "Dan Barton (Ray Mullins)", "Sam Wolfe (Sammy)", "Gustave Lax (Cantor)", "Murray Alper (Taxi Driver)", "Jimmy Ames (Music Store Proprietor)", "Phil Arnold (Stagehand)", "Vince Barnett (Bartender)", "Ralph Brooks (Man in Audience)", "James Conaty (Party Guest)", "Jimmy Conlin (Mr. Demming, Photographer)", "Bess Flowers (Party Guest)", "James Gonzalez (Dance Director)", "Stuart Hall (Waiter)", "Harry Harvey (Train Conductor)", "Mike Lally (Nightclub Patron)", "Earl Lee (Arthur)", "David Leonard (Dr. Johnson)", "Wilbur Mack (Man in Theatrical Agent's Office / Nightclub Patron)", "Harold Miller (Nightclub Patron / Party Guest)", "Barry Norton (Nightclub Patron)", "Ezelle Poule (Casting Secretary)", "Angi O.
