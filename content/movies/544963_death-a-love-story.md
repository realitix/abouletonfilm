While Howard at first rejected traditional cancer treatments in favor of alternative therapy, and then embraced chemotherapy and liver transplants as last-ditch attempts to save his life, the film's ultimate focus is on Howard's spiritual progression as he adjusts to the notion of his passing. \"Death: A Love Story\" was enthusiastically received when screened at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i8zmQ72uen9dRaPcXVuKdJ6TW86.jpg", "actors": ["Michelle LeBrun ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
