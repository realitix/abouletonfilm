After 61 years of hegemony by the Colorado Party and by the dictator Stroessner, this unexpected victory came as a political miracle. But politics is not for saints and the dream turns into a nightmare. Power and Impotence tells the utopia of political change: the adventure of common men accessing power to try and challenge the system from within. In a political thriller settled in stranger-than-fiction Paraguay, we follow their hopes and disappointments from a unique behind-the-scene point of view, until the tragic ending. An uncommon film, an authentic modern Shakespearean drama about power.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
