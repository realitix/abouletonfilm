Five scenarios with different actors portray realistic situations where divorce is clearly warranted but, because marriage was strictly in the purview of the Catholic Church at that time, which strictly forbade divorce, these people are shown to suffer the consequences in their daily lives. Italy got its first civilian divorce law in 1970.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cVMLJ2q1gC2ARuJq20LrdDf6eoG.jpg", "actors": ["Ugo Tognazzi (Vasco Timballo)", "Annie Girardot (Margherita)", "Romolo Valli (Francesco)", "Marina Malfatti (Rosanna)", "Scilla Gabel (Wilma)", "Didi Perego (Caterina Rinaldi)", "Isa Crescenzi (Giulia)", "Gabriella Giorgelli (Livia)", "Enzo Robutti ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
