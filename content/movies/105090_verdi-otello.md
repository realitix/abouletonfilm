This is one performance where both playwright and composer are well served. Pl\u00e1cido Domingo\u2019s Otello is one of the glories of the operatic world, beautifully sung and so commandingly acted that audiences are devastated by the end. Ren\u00e9e Fleming\u2019s ravishingly beautiful Desdemona is deeply moving, and as Iago, James Morris is as beguiling as he is menacing. Under James Levine\u2019s conducting the Met orchestra and chorus are vital characters in the drama.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AjEtNZXwnk1BoUlRmUH65TsleeG.jpg", "actors": ["Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (Otello)", "Ren\u00e9e Fleming (Desdemona)", "James Morris (Jago)", "Jane Bunnell (Emilia)", "Richard Croft (Cassio)", "Charles Anthony (Roderigo)", "Theodore Lambrinos (Montano)", "Christopher Schaldenbrand (Un Eraldo)", "Alexander Anisimov (Lodovico)", "James Levine (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
