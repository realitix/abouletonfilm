From boating at the beach to splashing in the pool, the water is the perfect place to enjoy the sunshine. The fun continues when Kipper, Tiger and Arnold compete in a game of crazy golf. But when the friends decide to race one another, Tiger lands in the pond. To Pig's amazement, Arnold learns to ride a bike - with a little help from Kipper.
