My guess is that if one knows what he or she is looking at before seeing this little film, half of its excitement and a good deal of its meaning disappear. Seen in total innocence, though (and maybe I'm exaggerating the importance of this), SKY BLUE WATER is a wonder. With Gottheim's Blues and Frampton's Lemon (for Robert Hunt), it is one of the happiest, most uplifting short films I've ever seen.\" -- Scott MacDonald, Idiolects", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iw9u7FVL3aTxt1li0mitSAYKtXG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
