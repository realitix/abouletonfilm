When the re-emergence of old friends and the mounting pressures of family obligations impinge upon their daily lives, they soon discover that loneliness is not synonymous with isolation, and that true abandonment comes in many forms. Directed by Jay McRoy (Acts of Contrition, 2009), Abandon explores the relationship between human memory and personal history. In the process, Abandon reveals that the \u201cstubbornly persistent illusions\u201d which Albert Einstein once posited as separating \u201cthe past, present, and future\u201d are far more precarious and easily shattered than we would care to imagine.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
