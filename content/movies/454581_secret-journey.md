I was curious about Yuda and begun following him around, but one day he disappeared with my video camera. A couple months later, a lady name Michi Nakamura (Yukiko Okamoto) came to my office. She had the strap of my video camera that Yuda stole from me, and said she saw the address that was on the strap, so she came here. I asked her about Yuda, and she told me that he was dead. Right after she left my office, she was hit by a car, I visited her in hospital and she begins to tell me about the mysterious story of her and Yuda.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k1sIZeH3ikd2j1qvv6wPIeAJTT9.jpg", "actors": ["Kazuma Honda ()", "Ken Mitsuishi ()", "Masayoshi Haneda ()", "Masaki Miura ()", "Yuri Nakamura ()", "Yukiko Okamoto ()", "Shir\u00f4 Shimomoto ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
