One is seen coming, at some distance, and eventually stops at the platform. Doors of the railway-cars open and attendants help passengers off and on.  Popular legend has it that, when this film was shown, the first-night audience fled the caf\u00e9 in terror, fearing being run over by the \"approaching\" train.
