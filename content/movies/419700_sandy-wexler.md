That's an unfortunate mindset from the west. While the rest of the world enjoying these guys films without prejudice. This is not Sandlers best, but a better one. Initially, it annoyed me to see the Sandler with the same old accent. But seeing the some of the scenes, it actually made sense. I especially thought it should have been a serious drama, but then it would haven't worked out with the kind of characters it had. Particularly the Kevin James.\r\n\r\nIt is a 90s tale about a Hollywood manager. Narrated as a flashback as the film stars recall his legacy. His latest find, a young woman with a golden voice, is an upcoming sensation. He always stood for her in all the good and bad situations. But time comes he to back off and focus on his other clients. The remaining is about his job, how it shapes are told. I have heard that it was loosely based on Sandler's own manager. I also liked cameos, particularly Rikishi! A long film. But I liked it at the end. It is an okay film. Those who hate Sandler should stay away and let the rest of the guys enjoy it.\r\n\r\n_6.5/10_"}], "recommandations_id": [389053, 402582, 339396, 347969], "youtube_key": "wBPBSroi_VE"}
