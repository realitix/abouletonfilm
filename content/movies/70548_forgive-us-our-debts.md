Jesus teaches that forgiveness comes from God as He instructs Peter to catch a fish that contains a coin to pay Peter's debt. Jesus also teaches about a man who is forgiven by his king of an enormous debt. Yet, the forgiven man leaves and immediately casts a man, who owes him almost nothing, into prison. The king then rescinds his forgiveness. To receive forgiveness we must also forgive.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eFJOvDzqAWflffpa8QY6brMDQVu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
