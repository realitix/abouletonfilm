One woman gets involved with a man who is still symbolically, if not umbilically attached to his mother, the second woman makes half-hearted attempts to get back together with her husband. The third woman calls her husband to say \"Happy New Year\" and he interprets the gist of her message as a veiled suicide threat -- rushing her quickly into a hospital for treatment. The mishaps and misadventures of the women are a telling commentary on the assumptions that marriage brings with it, and how to gain independence in spite of oneself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/65mILyZfaWDzpyZHhMmiBTekx7k.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
