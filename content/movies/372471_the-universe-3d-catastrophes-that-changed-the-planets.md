We'll voyage back in time to investigate the violent events that profoundly shaped the planets, including earth itself. We'll witness stunning revelations about what transformed Mars into a barren, hostile desert; the disaster that changed Venus from temperate to hellish; the impact that blew Mercury's mantle, turning it into a planetary core; a colossal disturbance that rearranged the orbits of the gas giants; titanic impacts on Jupiter, and how a lost moon may finally explain Saturn's rings.  Dynamically illustrated by spectacular NASA footage and cutting-edge CGI, THE UNIVERSE IN 3D tells the singular story of how our world came to be.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
