He soon became a leading figure in theater and film on the American Continent. Singled out by critics as a destroyer of the language, he quickly won the approval of the public. His ability to improvise revolutionized the film industry. His talent as an actor, singer, dancer and comedian contributed to the Golden Age of Mexican Cinema. From El Hijo Desobediente to Capit\u00e1n Mantarraya, from Cuidad Ju\u00e1rez to Havana, from mambo to rock, the legacy of Tin Tan makes him one of the great icons of Mexico today. This film tells his story as it has never been told before.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i3cRJg9Rm97N4mZ3s6Mjwa63cTW.jpg", "actors": ["Rosal\u00eda Vald\u00e9s Juli\u00e1n (Herself)", "Manuel 'Loco' Vald\u00e9s (Himself)", "Silvia Pinal (Herself)", "Yolanda Montes (Herself)", "\u00c1ngel Adolfo Villase\u00f1or (Himself)", "Bono Batani (Himself)", "Salvador Vielma Cruz (Himself)", "Cristina Spivis ()", "Fritz Gl\u00f6ckner ()", "Carlos Monsivais ()", "Laura Mabel Vald\u00e9s ()", "Margarito Esparza Nev\u00e1rez ()", "Ana Luisa Peluffo ()", "Antonio Vald\u00e9s (Herself)", "Fannie Kaufman (Herself)", "Rosita Forn\u00e9s (Herself)", "Rosal\u00eda Juli\u00e1n (Herself)", "Gaspar Henaine (Himself)", "Jorge Zamora (Himself)", "Germ\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s (Himself (Archive Footage))", "Marcelo Ch\u00e1vez (Himself (Archive Footage))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "P_89ghfPDJ8"}
