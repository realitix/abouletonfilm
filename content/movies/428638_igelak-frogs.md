Abandoned by his superior (who got him involved in the heist), Pello escapes from the court room and goes on the run.  With no papers, no money and no family or friends he can trust, he changes identity so that he can stay undercover for a time.  By chance he ends up hiding in a building that has been occupied by a group of people evicted from their homes who are fighting his bank. Pello gains their trust, all the time planning to steal money from them to pay for false documentation so that he can escape abroad and start a new life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8nNzlH4kW7Z2tZpVW32Mg0RkliO.jpg", "actors": ["Gorka Otxoa (Pello)", "Miren Gazta\u00f1aga (Sara)", "Josean Bengoetxea (Paco)", "Gurutze Beitia (Mertxe)", "Mikel Losada (Raul)", "Mar\u00eda Cruickshank (Ainhara)", "I\u00f1aki Rikarte (Uribe)", "Itziar Itu\u00f1o (Carmen)", "Javier Tolosa (Juan)", "Itziar Atienza (Leire)", "Ram\u00f3n Agirre (Lawyer)", "Mikel Telleria (Xabier)", "Elena Irureta (Nurse)", "Asier Hernandez (Ander)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "GKlEBlCa7QA"}
