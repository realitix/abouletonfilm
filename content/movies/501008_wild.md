The result of his efforts is an exciting, moving and often humorous film, revealing the beauty and diversity of this wild park in every season. We also watch the main characters grow up to adulthood, a path inevitably dogged with challenges. Enting: \u201cTo me, this park, in any season, has an almost un-Dutch beauty. It is the largest continuous nature reserve in northwest Europe with an incredible variety of landscapes and life. It has forests, heath, sand drifts, brooks and pushed moraines. With my film, I would like to give a new insight into its incredibly diverse nature.\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wH2eTmCqgB00j0TdK060yttdx4H.jpg", "actors": ["Andr\u00e9 van Duin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "hDNteTNtD9s"}
