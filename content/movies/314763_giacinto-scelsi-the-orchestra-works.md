Each piece is interspersed with excerpts from a fourth Scelsi composition, \"Canti Del Capricorno.\" Though he had little formal training, Scelsi is now regarded as one of the most creative composers of the 20th century.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
