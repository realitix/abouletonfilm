I only used clips from movies I could think of or find quotes from online, so if anyone out there has any additional usages of \"gay\" and \"queer\" in old movies, let me know so I can start up a sequel. Dedicated to all in the LGBT community, as well as the fine people at Turner Classic Movies for inspiring this project.*", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
