He is found with a arrow through the heart, but Vance deduces that the body was placed and not found where he was killed. The note found dealing with the murder was part of a nursery rhyme and signed by 'Bishop'. The only witness may have been Mrs. Drukker and Adolph, but they are not talking. As the murders progress, each one is accompanied by a nursery rhyme. It is up to Philo Vance to unravel the clues and unmask the identity of the murderer 'Bishop'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/srYgjTKvoXvOIAbRUjNmfWP1hcl.jpg", "actors": ["Basil Rathbone (Philo Vance)", "Leila Hyams (Belle Dillard)", "Roland Young (Sigurd 'Erik' Arnesson)", "Alec B.
