Four miles later, Jimmy walks onto the Double-O Ranch, from which he had been thrown off four years before by his dad, who had blamed Jimmy for something that his twin brother Duke had done. Duke, home from college, took over the ranch when Mr. Dixon became ill, and has run it into the ground. When Duke goes to the bank to repay a debt to Jimmy, he rides onto Phoenix with all of the ranch money.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l16A0hAbDMx77UaKIzMXaItWQSJ.jpg", "actors": ["Bob Steele (Jimmy Dixon / Duke Dixon)", "Kay McCoy (Jean Adams)", "George 'Gabby' Hayes (Soupy Baxter)", "Earl Dwire (Regan)", "John Elliott (Mr. Dixon)", "Hortense Petra (Blondie)", "Anne Howard (Nurse Mary)", "Nancy Deshon (Millie)", "Frank McCarroll (Swede)", "Chris Allen (Barfly)", "Barney Beasley (Henchman)", "Herman Hack (Henchman)", "Jack Hendricks (Barfly)", "George Morrell (Barfly)", "Perry Murdock (Tramp / Singer)", "Artie Ortego (Henchman)", "Tex Phelps (Henchman)", "S.S.
