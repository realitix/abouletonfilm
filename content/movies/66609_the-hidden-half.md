The official's wife of nearly 20 years, Fereshteh Samimi, writes him a letter to read when he reaches the hotel - the story of her student days during the revolution of 1978. We see the story in flashbacks as he reads: she leaves her province on scholarship, joins a Communist youth group, avoids arrest, and comes under the sway of a suave older man, Roozbeh Javid, a literary-magazine editor. As she tells her husband about the hidden half of her life, Fereshteh asks that he listen to the woman facing execution, a woman and therefore one of Iran's hidden half.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bJPc0tm3WarsP6oJYhC24yvevbp.jpg", "actors": ["Niki Karimi (Fereshteh)", "Mohammad Nikbin (Roozbeh Javid)", "Atila Pesiani (Husband)", "Akbar Moazezi (Mr. Rastegar)", "Soghra Obeisi ()", "Afarin Obeisi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
