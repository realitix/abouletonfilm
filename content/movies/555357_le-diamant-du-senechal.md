Two scoundrels plot to rob her of the diamond before she can part with it. They waylay her and carry her off to a house where they demand from her the diamond. With a smile she shows them the receipt for a registered package as she had deemed it safer to send it by this means. Later she takes them off their guard and escapes. An exciting automobile chase now takes place, ending with the car in which the would-be diamond robbers are seated being hurled over the cliff to destruction.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
