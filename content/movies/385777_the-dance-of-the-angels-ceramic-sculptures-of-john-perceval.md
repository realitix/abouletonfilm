He created his angels \"more or less as symbols of the world's survival.\" An intangible element common to all Perceval's angels is their spirit of humanity. These ceramic sculptures are disting- uished by their beautiful modelling, and their lustrous red copper glaze with its uncanny depth and beauty. Perceval does not devote himself exclusively to ceramic sculpture; he gives equal time to painting and has won the McCaughey and Vizard-Whollohan Prizes, and shared the Wynne Prize in 1961.
