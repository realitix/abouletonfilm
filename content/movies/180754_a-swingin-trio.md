As a result, he finds himself \"trapped\" in lavish surroundings - his luxury jail - and with publisher rejection letters piling high, Homer has convinced himself of his wife's infidelity. Phillips' darkly-comic script follows Homer as he dives into the prickly territories of self-awareness and self pity, in his quest to find the truth about his possibly cheating wife--and himself--all at a Valentine's Day dinner decidedly set for three. A largely dialogue-driven film, A Swingin' Trio is about four things: love, music, betrayal, and one really good dinner.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ffOso7rKdgsR1KdJDRXdrhzId1H.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Walter ()", "Timeca M.
