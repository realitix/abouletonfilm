The trouble began when the friend was framed by the leader of the Cattlemen's association who made it seem like he was a rustler. Because the friend was an ex-con, the evidence against him seems airtight. The wandering hero must work extra hard to prove his friend's innocence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9SarlB7N5a6zyX2WsSOKR1pDnJ9.jpg", "actors": ["Charles Starrett (Steve Harrison)", "Kay Harris (Carol Comstock)", "Arthur Hunnicutt (Arkansas (as Arthur 'Arkansas' Hunnicutt))", "Ernest Tubb (Ernie)", "Forrest Taylor (Mark Comstock (uncredited))", "Lane Bradford (Henchman (uncredited))", "John Tyrrell (Doc Carson (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
