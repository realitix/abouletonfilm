Streetlights seem to be regarded on principle as mere lighting consoles, erected to adorn the city but otherwise negligible. Taxis, however, are looked upon as halfway trustworthy ferries navigating this erratic stream of road users, all the more so when the whole city has been set in motion even more than usual. Produced between March and September 2011 during the blossoming of the Arab Revolution and recorded with the smallest available equipment, permanently installed in several taxis, \u201cOtra noche en la tierra\u201d is an exciting picture of Egyptian society during those months. Dozens of passengers share their concerns (frequently) or euphoria (sometimes), their expectations and fears in view of an uncertain future with us.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ljQjG3F8GGAN6NJgMdjfOedOkvq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
