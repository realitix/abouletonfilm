Smith makes the acquaintance of a group of orphans, Jewish refugees of the concentration camps. It takes some doing, but Smith wins the love and trust of these displaced youngsters. Like most government-funded Israeli productions of the early 1950s, Faithful City is designed more to instruct and inform than entertain. That it happens to be entertaining in the bargain is all the more reason to seek out this extremely rare film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wRJB44CBbH4jXLOmlxnGt1h8Mzu.jpg", "actors": ["Jamie Smith (Sam)", "Ben Josef (Davidel)", "John Slater (Ezra)", "Didi Ramati (Tamar)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
