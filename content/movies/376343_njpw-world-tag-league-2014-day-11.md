It was created in 1991 as the Super Grade Tag League, as a continuation of a regular tag team tournament held since 1980, gaining the name G1 Tag League in 1999. In 2012, New Japan's new owners, the Bushiroad company, renamed the tournament to its current form. The winners of the tournament, assuming they do not already hold the belts, obtain #1 contendership to the IWGP Tag Team Championship. The 2014 finals featured Hirooki Goto &amp; Katsuyori Shibata battling Doc Gallows &amp; Karl Anderson.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oijwP8QG41tpdqFBgsJ1pTEAWCl.jpg", "actors": ["Hirooki Goto (Himself)", "Katsuyori Shibata (Himself)", "Andrew Hankinson (Doc Gallows)", "Chad Allegra (Karl Anderson)", "Hiroshi Tanahashi (Himself)", "Kota Ibushi (Himself)", "Manuel Alfonso Andrade Oropeza (La Sombra)", "Shinya Makabe (Himself)", "Kazuchika Okada (Himself)", "Shinsuke Nakamura (Himself)", "Tomohiro Ishii (Himself)", "Nobuo Yoshihashi (YOSHI-HASHI)", "Allen Neal Jones ()", "Fale Simitaitoko (Bad Luck Fale)", "Yujiro Takahashi ()", "Ryusuke Taguchi ()", "Tetsuya Naito ()", "Tomoaki Honma ()", "Keiji Takayama (Gedo)", "Toru Yano ()", "Kazushi Sakuraba ()", "Minoru Suzuki ()", "Takao Yoshida ()", "Takayuki Iizuka ()", "Hiroyoshi Yamamoto ()", "Satoshi Kojima ()", "Jax Dane ()", "Rob Conway ()", "Matthew Marinelli (Matt Taven)", "Michael Bennett ()", "Mitsuhide Hirasawa (Captain New Japan)", "Keiichi Yamada ()", "Harry Francis Smith (Davey Boy Smith Jr.)", "Lance Vance Hoyt (Lance Archer)", "Manabu Nakanishi ()", "Yuji Nagata ()", "Kyosuke Mikami (El Desperado)", "Taichiro Maki ()", "Tetsuya Shimizu (BUSHI)", "Yoshihiro Yamazaki (Tiger Mask)", "Sho Tanaka ()", "Yohei Komatsu ()", "Allen Neal Jones (Himself)", "Yujiro Takahashi (Himself)", "Ryusuke Taguchi (Himself)", "Tetsuya Naito (Himself)", "Tomoaki Honma (Himself)", "Toru Yano (Himself)", "Kazushi Sakuraba (Himself)", "Minoru Suzuki (Himself)", "Takao Yoshida (Himself)", "Takayuki Iizuka (Himself)", "Hiroyoshi Yamamoto (Himself)", "Satoshi Kojima (Himself)", "Jax Dane (Himself)", "Rob Conway (Himself)", "Michael Bennett (Himself)", "Keiichi Yamada (Himself)", "Manabu Nakanishi (Himself)", "Yuji Nagata (Himself)", "Taichiro Maki (Himself)", "Sho Tanaka (Himself)", "Yohei Komatsu (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
