The so-called \"crime of passion\" was covered live and rabidly followed like a perverse telenovela. This film's pointed analysis of the Brazilian police and media's sensationalization of violence against women sadly explains the country's elevated rate of femicide.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yLveoSwfOFIsfRUX68bUcpxI62m.jpg", "actors": ["Ana Paula Lewin (Herself)", "Analba Teixeira (Herself)", "Augusto Rossini (Himself)", "Elisa Gargiulo (Herself)", "Elo\u00e1 Pimentel (Herself)", "Lindemberg Alves (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "uY35iu1rX_Q"}
