When she is caught in a web of politics, corruption, lies and lust, she is forced to make a terrible choice.  Tosca is a timeless opera that features fundamental archetypes of the human condition: ruthless power grabbers, idealist revolutionaries and strong women ready to sacrifice it all. These characters truly come alive at the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma, the natural home of Puccini's masterpiece.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b18D8jzNxv7OpR1TcsVZ1AnUF1L.jpg", "actors": ["Oksana Dyka ()", "Stefano La Colla ()", "Roberto Frontali ()", "William Corr\u00f2 ()", "Domenico Colaianni ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
