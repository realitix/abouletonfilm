Time is pulsating here according to peculiar inner cycles: getting faster, slower or returning to its ordinary rhythm. We wander through physical and mental spaces: wards, gardens, memories. It is a story of two main protagonists, yet two strangers, for whom the regular talk about death constitutes an integral part of life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/evkQMojAL4WUMuWjU0bKXOgY1fS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
