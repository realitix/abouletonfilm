And the laughs do come big and hearty as Hui bounces his cheeky humour off a terrific large supporting cast including the sophisticated Hu-chin and the lovely Pai Hsiao-man. Keeping the Benny Hill-style hi-jinks afloat is stalwart Shaw director Li han-hsiang who manages to switch flawlessly between these cheeky flings and his period epics.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/roZTd8fbEsnr0WsfMeXO8aNCISH.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Hui (Jimmy Fang/Dr Ng/Jiang Lang)", "Hu Chin (Hu Jin/7th Lady)", "Ku Feng (Liu Lao Liu)", "Ingrid Hu Yin-Yin (Hu Yin Yin)", "Paul Chang Chung (Hu Jin's boyfriend)", "Sai Gwa-Pau (Mahjong den clerk)", "Shum Lo (Mahjong gambler)", "Wong Sam (Big Boss)", "Cheng Miu (Speaker/Brothel customer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
