The title is explained within the context of the story, though one has to be patient. Essentially, this is the story of one man's guilt: the wealthy man (Arturo Cordoba) has convinced himself that he has killed his wife, a fact that has a devastating effect on all that follows. Several plot convolutions come and go before the truth is out -- not to mention the truth behind the truth. More than one reviewer noted the resemblances between La Ausente and the much-earlier Hitchcock film Rebecca; also noted was the later film's choppy continuity, the result of one too much censorial edit.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tpK2muwlGYT4TBFi7CblyryMzDq.jpg", "actors": ["Arturo de C\u00f3rdova ()", "Rosita Quintana ()", "Andrea Palma ()", "Ram\u00f3n Gay ()", "Mim\u00ed Derba ()", "Carlos Riquelme ()", "Ang\u00e9lica Mar\u00eda ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
