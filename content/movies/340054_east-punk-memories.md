Their testimonies help us understand how the market economy has put the Hungarian population in an ambivalent situation. With a liberal left-wing dismantling the socialist heritage and a social right-wing reverting to nationalism, the traditional line between the Right and the Left has been blurred. What remains is an ideological confusion that we all have to face.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
