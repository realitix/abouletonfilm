We learn about him not from the 69-year-old man on stage, but from his 39-year-old self on the tape he chooses to listen to. On the 'awful occasion' of his birthday, Krapp was then and is now in the habit of reviewing the past year and 'separating the grain from the husks'. He isolates memories of value, fertility and nourishment to set against creeping death 'when all my dust has settled'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ff846EqJr9QnXTUbl80ATsGpehG.jpg", "actors": ["John Hurt (Krapp)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [42265, 114452], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
