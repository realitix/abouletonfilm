Ordinary people, some long since dead, their names and identities largely forgotten, appear shimmering from the depth of the vaults to take a starring role.  Brilliantly edited together, these silent individuals become composite characters, who emerge to tell us their stories, given voice by King Creosote's poetic music and lyrics.\"  BBC Four website", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w2ecrlOP07A39eGA42MMAz4Mn63.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
