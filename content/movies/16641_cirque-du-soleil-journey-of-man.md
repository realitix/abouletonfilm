We see underwater swimmers representing this. He is young, in a jungle setting, with two fanciful \"instincts\" guiding him as swooping bird-like acrobats initially menace, then delight. As an adolescent, he enters a desert, where a man spins a large cube of metal tubing. He leaves his instinct-guides behind, and enters a garden where two statues dance in a pond. As he watches their sensual acrobatics of love, he becomes a man. He is offered wealth (represented by a golden hat) by a devil figure. In a richly decorated room, a scruffy troupe of a dozen acrobats and a little girl reawaken the old man's youthful nature and love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6RDIUiDFzYPglVXXaQYThU6M490.jpg", "actors": ["Ian McKellen (Narrator (voice))", "Nicky Dewhurst (Young Man)", "Brian Dewhurst  (Old Man)", "Anait Karagyezyan (Vagabond Girl)", "Chris Van Wagenen (Youth)", "Cully Smoller (Infant / Child)", "Kenny Raskin (Man)", "Mikhail Matorin (Cube Act)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [15550], "youtube_key": "UcJVpBk0_Vs"}
