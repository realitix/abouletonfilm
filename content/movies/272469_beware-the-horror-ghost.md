Hence begins a string of fantastical events, some which hit the mark, some of which fail miserably. Highlights include protagonist DJ encountering a hallway full of old, disused doorknobs and asking himself \u201cWhy are there so many doorknobs\u201d and two vampires attempting to cover up their identities by saying they are \u201cva\u2026vase enthusiasts!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe acting is, for the most part, quite superb. Vampires Domhnaill and Cian are as creepy as they are sympathetic, DJ- whilst an underdeveloped character due to the weak script- brings warmth to his role, and John and Alice excel as a lunatic priest and the victim of his attempted exorcism. A final-act twist featuring a cameo from perhaps the most famous person of all time hits the mark wonderfully.\r\n\r\nProvoking an immense sense of nostalgia in those who experienced the golden age of Hollywood Horror Cinema, it\u2019s unlikely we will see a more intelligently crafted short film this year.
