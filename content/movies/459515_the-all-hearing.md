This unorthodox intervention into the sonic landscape of the \u2018loudest city on Earth\u2019 followed on from the military regime\u2019s attempts to restrict such sermons to government-sanctioned topics (that week, the Prophet\u2019s Ascension to Heaven). Cutting between close-ups of the sheikhs\u2019 idiosyncratic addresses and wide shots of their congregations and the loudspeakers amplifying their voices in the streets outside, Abu Hamdan\u2019s images show how the sheikhs\u2019 message is disseminated in a way that contradicts its content.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
