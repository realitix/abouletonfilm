The most successful of these oligarchs was Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who quickly became the wealthiest man in Russia. But Khodorkovsky was invested not only in business, but also in true social reform and a new ideal of an open society, an attitude that ran afoul of the absolute rule of Vladimir Putin. Tracing Khodorkovsky's dramatic, ambiguous rise to power and subsequent fall at the hands of Putin's KGB-infested government, this probing, deeply troubling documentary reveals a nation still unsure of its commitment to economic and social liberties.  - Written by Los Angeles Film Festival", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fBS8IoFBG28L9dVnfoJvgSRZq63.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [284550, 105379], "youtube_key": "taZA96BCma0"}
