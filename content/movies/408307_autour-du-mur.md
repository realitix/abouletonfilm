Guney himself comes across as often angry and impatient; he slaps a young actor so as to make him cry for a scene and shows about as much warmth as December in Moscow. Unfortunately, none of this contributes to garnering sympathy for his anti-military cause.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
