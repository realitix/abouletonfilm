Its subjects are role-playing (especially sexual role-playing), and the masochism of playing a role that conforms to others' exploitative interests.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kQK2GGrBu6nCDrzHWJS5Zu0RI2P.jpg", "actors": ["Jenny Runacre (1st Girl)", "Pat Ford (2nd Girl)", "Catherine Kessler (3rd Girl)", "Linda Marlowe (4th Girl)", "Malcolm Kaye (Manager)", "John Grillo (2nd Girl's Partner)", "Andrew Carr (Announcer)", "Derek Paget (Dancer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "5G5H42qyop8"}
