She chooses an elderly, homeless ex-con (Mickey Rooney) as her pseudo-grandfather and he teaches her - and her family -\r the true meaning of Christmas.\r Somewhat predictable..  but has a good plot twist about half way through that keeps it interesting.\r A solid, low-key performance by Mickey Rooney as the seemingly broken down homeless man saves this one from drowning in it's own mushiness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qpZRn4WDlK5uyL0jx3xgaat71Mk.jpg", "actors": ["Mickey Rooney (Elmer)", "Simon Richards (Reg Spencer)", "Lesley Kelly (Barb Spencer)", "Chantellese Kent (Amanda Spencer)", "Noah Plener (Justin Spencer)", "Joel Kaiser (Sam Whitney)", "Susan Hamann (Marla Whitney)", "Ken McKenzie (Archie Whitney)", "Hersh Kalles (Courtney Whitney)", "Karen Inwood (Jessica)", "Ken Innes (The Handyman)", "Peter Ferri (Oscar)", "Paul Babiak (Morris)", "John Tench (Mugger)", "Alberta Davidson (Marie)", "Austin Schatz (Office Santa)", "Victoria Shaffleburg (Office Worker)", "Hereward Pooley (Michael)", "Frank Duffield (Store Santa)", "Richard Williamson (Policeman No. 1)", "Scott Wickware (Policeman No. 2)", "Zabbe Smyth (Sales Clerk)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "vdURy7-D4S8"}
