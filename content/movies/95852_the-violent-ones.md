So the sheriff arrests the only outsiders there are. All he can do is hope that one of them will admit to being the attacker or that the girl can wake up long enough to identify him. But at the same time her father is preparing a lynch mob.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ptVAPP8r6jdUvFKuiHo5D1AajHo.jpg", "actors": ["Fernando Lamas (Manuel Vega)", "Aldo Ray (Joe Vorzyck)", "Tommy Sands (Mike Marain)", "David Carradine (Lucas Barnes)", "Lisa Gaye (Dolores)", "Melinda Marx (Juanita)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
