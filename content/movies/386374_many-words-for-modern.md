Almeida was one of the first to introduce modern architecture in Tanzania. At that time architectural modernism was the preferred expression of the intended colonial welfare state. After Independence in 1961 Nyerere\u2019s African socialism used the same architectural style to convey the hope and strength of the new African nation.  Following Almeida and some of his colleagues, the film questions what is left of the dreams and ideals of this first generation. It searches for new definitions of happiness in booming African cities like today\u2019s Dar es Salaam. The film documents the everlasting human pursuit of modernity, not only in architecture but also in contemporary urban life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gwx1lJjuqjNJL5jdsiKATFi2kfw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
