Do they influence violent behavior? What effect have they had on society? How would you describe videogames to Leonardo da Vinci? These are always great questions to start a conversation.  Pixel Poetry is a documentary film about progressive creative culture as it has been championed by one of its greatest advocates - videogames. Using popular debates that have long surrounded videogames as a catalyst for this, the film will analyze the misunderstood notions and arguments in art and technological advancement to bring a new perspective to a compelling discussion about the evolution of its meaning.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mvKQiVSVlnNZ3RnuLecv7CQ60wM.jpg", "actors": ["Jimmy Barnett (Himself)", "Norman Caruso (Himself)", "Adam Sessler (Himself)", "Warren Spector (Himself)", "Ajay Chadha (Himself)", "David Eddings (Himself)", "Johnathan Holmes (Himself)", "Rami Ishmail (Himself)", "Chris Kohler (Himself)", "Patrick Scott Patterson (Himself)", "James Portnow (Himself)", "Kellee Santiago (Himself)", "Steve Tom Sawyer (Himself)", "Kaz Takeshita (Himself)", "Amy White (Himself)", "Chris Wiseman (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "FHPPDJfnzQw"}
