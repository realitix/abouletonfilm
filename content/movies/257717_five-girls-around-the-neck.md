Schorm examined a girl's problems of being giving too much. She tries to buy the goodwill of her less fortunate friends; her intentions are pure, but in the difficulty of communicating she learns envy and deceit, and must decide if she will submit to double dealing or steel her life against self-deception and mediocrity.  In addition to the relationship between the girl and her friends, Schorm introduces a teenage romance and the broader relationship between the girl's parents - neatly tied together with segments of Weber's opera \"Der Freisch\u00fctz\". He reveals himself as a skilled psychological director with a wide range of knowledge about people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h0wBOUx8LUiOc5cpuHWkYR3EDCq.jpg", "actors": ["Andrea \u010cunderl\u00edkov\u00e1 (Natasa)", "Jana Krupi\u010dkov\u00e1 (Zdena)", "Lucie \u017dulov\u00e1 (Jana)", "Dana Mat\u011bjkov\u00e1 (Jirina)", "Mark\u00e9ta K\u0159enkov\u00e1 (Libuse)", "Martin Vedral (Petr)", "Leo\u0161 Sucha\u0159\u00edpa (Otec Nata\u0161i)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
