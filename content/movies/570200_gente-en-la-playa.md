The film was more a study of people's behavior, shot in 16mm with a hand-held camera, which was hidden most of the time. In its execution it was like my New York film 58-59, except that it was filmed in sunlight almost the whole time, on a public beach, and in the cafes nearby. There was no spoken commentary, only the actual sounds and typical Cuban jukebox music.\" - Nestor Almendros, A Man With a Camera", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
