While the Russians invaded Ostpreussen hundred of thousands of civilians were evacuated by ships. Gotenhafen was the last open port and ships left the town almost by the minute, overloaded by refugees. One of the last ships to leave Gotenhafen was the 'Wilhelm Gustloff', a former 'Kraft durch Freude' pleasure cruiser designed for 1000 passengers. Until today it is unknown how many people were on board but it is said to be around 10.000. The ship sunk without a trace and only a handful of people survived this hellish nightmare.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vEmpQgXL3cl4HTxHBSspx0EnY8P.jpg", "actors": ["Sonja Ziemann (Maria Reiser)", "Gunnar M\u00f6ller (Kurt Reiser)", "Erik Schumann (Hans Schott)", "Brigitte Horney (Generalin von Reuss)", "Mady Rahl (Edith Marquardt)", "Wolfgang Preiss (Dr. Beck)", "Erich Dunskus (Vater Marquardt)", "Willy Maertens (Vater Reiser)", "Tatjana Bokan (Dienstm\u00e4dchen Marta)", "Dietmar Sch\u00f6nherr (Gaston)", "G\u00fcnter Pfitzmann (Oberleutnant Dankel)", "G\u00fcnther Ungeheuer (Arzt)", "Karl-Heinz Kreienbaum (Funker der Gustloff)", "Carl Lange (Kapit\u00e4n Zahn)", "Carla Hagen (Monika)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
