Moving between scathing realism and subtle irony, the film raises questions of belonging and uprooting, exile and emigration, home and family.  Meir Cohen is a decorated police officer yet he barely earns a living. His new assignment to deport African migrant workers teaches him that foreigners aren\u2019t the only ones with no future in his country. Other plotlines intertwine with Meir\u2019s story: an Israeli-Filipino boy fighting for recognition; a taxi driver whose children are migrating to a distant country; and a veteran migrant worker who\u2019s forced to decide whether to leave or to hide until trouble passes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9rwBTJmTE6DWI2eSuc5RHptqERJ.jpg", "actors": ["Shmulik Calderone ()", "Yossi Marshek ()", "Pampas Shimon Udi ()", "Sun Intusap ()", "Liat Goren ()", "Neta Shpigelman ()", "Herzl Tobey ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
