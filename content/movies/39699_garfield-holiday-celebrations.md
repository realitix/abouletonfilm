Trouble is, Jon is clueless about how to cook a big bird; fortunately, starving Garfield has the good sense to call in Jon's spirited grandmother for a culinary rescue. Grandma shows up, too, in \"A Garfield Christmas,\" about a family get-together that covers all the nice holiday stuff and, of course, lots of bickering, pouting, and jealousy. As long as Garfield gets his Yuletide lasagna, however, all is right with the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rokaCL2WGKZ5Qawt0HCFBGZazol.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
