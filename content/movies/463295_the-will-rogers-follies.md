It focuses on the life and career of famed humorist and performer Will Rogers, using as a backdrop the Ziegfeld Follies, which he often headlined, and describes every episode in his life in the form of a big production number. The Rogers character also performs rope tricks in between scenes. The revue contains snippets of Rogers' famous homespun style of wisdom and common sense and tries to convey the personality of this quintessentially American figure whose most famous quote was \"I never met a man I didn't like.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1JF1WvlZ2UZrzVJqrVrM7KivVcf.jpg", "actors": ["Keith Carradine (Will Rogers)", "Cady Huffman (Ziegfeld's Favorite)", "Dick Latessa (Clem Rogers)", "Jillana Laufer (New Ziegfeld Girl)", "Gregory Peck (Mr. Ziegfeld (voice))", "Roxane Barlow (New Ziegfeld Girl)", "Bonnie Brackney (The Wild West Show)", "Tom Brackney (The Wild West Show)", "Vince Bruce (The Roper)", "Gregory Scott Carter (Freddy Rogers)", "Rebecca Downing (New Ziegfeld Girl)", "Colleen Dunn (New Ziegfeld Girl)", "Rick Faugno (Will Rogers, Jr.)", "Tom Flagg (Mr. Ziegfeld's Stage Manager)", "John Ganun (Will Rogers Wrangler)", "Toni Georgiana (New Ziegfeld Girl)", "Ganine Giorgione (New Ziegfeld Girl)", "Eileen Grace (New Ziegfeld Girl)", "Luba Gregus (New Ziegfeld Girl)", "Dee Hoty (Betty Blake)", "Dana Jackson (New Ziegfeld Girl)", "Troy Britton Johnson (Will Rogers Wrangler)", "Tammy Minoff (Mary Rogers)", "Jerry Mitchell (Will Rogers Wrangler)", "Jason Opsahl (Will Rogers Wrangler)", "Stephanie Pope (New Ziegfeld Girl)", "Lance Robinson (James Rogers)", "Angie L.
