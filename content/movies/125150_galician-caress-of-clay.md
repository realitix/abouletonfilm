Val del Omar's notes show that, as he typically did, he had other alternative titles in mind, such as \"Acari\u00f1o de la Terra Meiga\" (Caress of the Magic Land), \"Acari\u00f1o a nosa terra\" (Caress of Our Land), or \"Barro de \u00e1nimas\" (Clay of Souls), and that in the final phase of the unfinished project he wanted to add a second sound channel \u2013 following the diaphonic principle, and using electro-acoustic techniques \u2013 consisting of ambient material that he intended to record at the first screenings of the film in the very places and to the very people that were its origin: its \"clay\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yMwaN7eM2HlDodlCvPNCHoqhGIR.jpg", "actors": ["Ezequiel Mendez (Voice)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [106196, 148353, 215160, 189943], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
