The hands sketch a small black dot and ink it in. Then the dot proceeds to bounce across the cartoonist's easel, until the hands finally catch it and unfold it into Ko-Ko the Clown.  There's a mouse in Max's studio, and Ko-Ko wants to catch him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3RMt2TglQ4wbt1tRu3Yh3wBP2nh.jpg", "actors": ["Max Fleischer (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
