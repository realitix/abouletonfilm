This artistic movement was directly connected not only with important art centers of the former Yugoslavia, but also with existing flows of world art during its brief and productive activities (7e Biennale de Paris, 19th Berlinale). The cultural and artistic emancipation of that time had implied individual freedom of expression and strong reaction to established boundaries. This avant-garde movement had become threat to communist establishment, the authors' work were sabotaged, the films were sealed off, five artists were taken to trial, two were sent in prison. How is it that the retrograde mechanism of shutting down and removing the most creative and representative progressive impulses of our surrounding is still so current to this day?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h5lzdHCxB859lPsJ4TrVX3JF8vS.jpg", "actors": ["Karpo A\u0107imovi\u0107-Godina (Himself)", "Slavko Bogdanovi\u0107 (Himself)", "Je\u0161a Denegri (Himself)", "\u010cedomir Dr\u010da (Himself)", "Iztok Plamen Geister (Himself)", "Una Jankov (Herself)", "Vladimir Kopicl (Himself)", "Na\u0161ko Kri\u017enar (Himself)", "Katalin Ladik (Herself)", "Bo\u017eidar Mandi\u0107 (Himself)", "Neboj\u0161a Milenkovi\u0107 (Himself)", "Marko Poga\u010dnik (Himself)", "Mi\u0161ko \u0160uvakovi\u0107 (Himself)", "B\u00e1lint Szombathy (Himself)", "Slobodan Ti\u0161ma (Himself)", "Dragoljub 'Ra\u0161a' Todosijevi\u0107 (Himself)", "Ot\u00f3 Tolnai (Himself)", "Goran Trbuljak (Himself)", "Sini\u0161a Tuci\u0107 (Himself)", "Vujica Re\u0161in Tuci\u0107 (Himself)", "Predrag Vrane\u0161evi\u0107 (Himself)", "Branko Vu\u010di\u0107evi\u0107 (Himself)", "Du\u0161an Vukmirovi\u0107 (Himself)", "Zelimir Zilnik (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
