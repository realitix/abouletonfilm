Queue the fairy tale: we watch each pig build his house, the first two pigs dance and play, the wolf arrives and, wearing a gypsy woman's disguise, almost catches them. They run to hide in the brick house, where the wolf tries various ruses to gain entry, including dressing as a poverty-stricken old woman reduced to playing a violin for donations. He fools the two simple pigs and gets inside. Will he dine on pork? The house has an elevator, the wolf gets the shaft.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/48n840bqKdhziwHQFuNKbjpHFkn.jpg", "actors": ["Sara Berner (First Little Pig (voice))", "Bea Benaderet (Second Little Pig (voice))", "Mel Blanc (Big Bad Wolf / Third Little Pig (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [100388, 100349, 163036, 100339], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
