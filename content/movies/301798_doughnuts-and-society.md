This changes when Belle suddenly becomes heir to a small fortune which allows her to crash high-society and make her daughter,Joan, a d\u00e9butante. This creates a rift between the two former partners, with the result that the proud Kate refuses to accept her friend's good fortune nor allow her son, Jerry, who is in love with Joan, to do so.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zzHEu5fxmWWLZb2cZYCzzWVxwXd.jpg", "actors": ["Louise Fazenda (Kate Flannagan)", "Maude Eburne (Belle Dugan)", "Ann Rutherford (Joan Dugan)", "Edward Nugent (Jerry Flannagan)", "Hedda Hopper (Mrs. Murray Hill)", "Franklin Pangborn (Benson)", "Rafael Storm (Ivan Petroff)", "Harold Minjir (Hoyt)", "Olaf Hytten (Wellington)", "Robert Light (Bill)", "Isabelle Keith (Miss Bradley)", "Smiley Burnette (Mover #2)", "Ed Cassidy (Barker (uncredited))", "Gino Corrado (Music Teacher (uncredited))", "John Elliott (Sanders (uncredited))", "Bud Jamison (Mover #1 (uncredited))", "Joseph North (Butler (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
