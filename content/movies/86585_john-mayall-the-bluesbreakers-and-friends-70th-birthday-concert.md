Mayall, a capable if not exactly stellar singer and multi-instrumentalist, is best known for the many fine players who passed through his band over the years, and Eric Clapton, the most renowned of the lot, is on hand here, as is former Mayall/Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor. Clapton sings several tunes in addition to playing his trademark stinging solos on \"Hideaway\" and \"All Your Love\" (two of the tunes most responsible for the \"Clapton is God\" graffiti seen around London in the '60s), while Taylor is mostly impressive as well.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oBkAMCYONwpl7MX4nNW3kzsRCHA.jpg", "actors": ["John Mayall (Himself)", "Eric Clapton ()", "Chris Barber ()", "Mick Taylor ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
