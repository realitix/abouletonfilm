The children used to be sent to boarding school, where they became estranged from their family and culture, but nowadays they can get homeschooling from teachers assigned to them by the Russian authorities. Seven-year-old Zakhar and his older brother Prokopy are the protagonists in this calm, observational film. Zakhar's first year of schooling is with Nelly, a young but serious teacher. She tells him about President Putin and the importance of mathematics, and he learns classical poems by heart.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/devpqCSQEPfGap2ZUS7hxQJyZ66.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "OleN9rNIKpc"}
