Mr. Li tries to find out if it's real or not. It may have something to do with the hotel grounds being a former gold mine.

It's believed to be the first film ever to contain the jiangshi, or hopping vampire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8Xs94TE2vSCaop4CvsIKqvkJ8jV.jpg", "actors": ["Manhua Zhou ()", "Huang Feng ()", "Jianong Gong ()", "Na Meng ()", "Guangzhao You ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
