Living and working in Melbourne in the 1960s, Dr Wainer put his life at risk to expose police corruption in an effort to change the law on abortion and put an end to the illegal operations that were killing young women.  It\u2019s a truly inspiring story. Dr Wainer\u2019s determination, even when his own life and that of his family\u2019s was threatened, never faltered. He was living proof that one person can make a difference and change the status quo.  With the support of Dr Wainer\u2019s family, the filmmakers have endeavoured to capture the essence of his struggle to expose police corruption and change the law.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yXXEzFitIgdmrWUxGN7YdQIzlSJ.jpg", "actors": ["Jeremy Sims (Bertram Wainer)", "Susie Porter (Peggy Berman)", "William McInnes (Jack Ford)", "Maeve Dermody (Jo Wainer)", "Mark Leonard Winter (Lionel Pugh)", "Caroline Craig (Barbara Wainer)", "Nicole Freeman (Felice Wainer)", "Emily Wheaton (Bonnie McGregor)", "Natalie Carr (Nurse)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
