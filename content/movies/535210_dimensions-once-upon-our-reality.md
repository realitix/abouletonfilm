Is it just the interaction of time, space, particles and forces? A hallucination created by billions of neurons in our body? A mathematical machine?  Are there other realities, universes or dimensions?  Dimensions is entertainment made and inspired by science and discovery. A rollercoaster ride of visuals and music that takes audiences on a fascinating journey. The show transports audiences to awe-inspiring worlds where they find the time and space to think and feel about the big questions of our time.  What sticks is a strong feeling that there may be unexplored realms and worlds in us, and around us, which influence us even more strongly than what we already know and understand.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
