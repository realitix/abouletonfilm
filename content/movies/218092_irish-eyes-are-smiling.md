Ball. Climbing to fame with such sentimental songs as \"When Irish Eyes are Smiling\" (hence the title), Ball romances a lovely showgirl (June Haver), who in turn catches the eye of a charming underworld character (Anthony Quinn). Monty Woolley does a variation of The Man who Came to Dinner in his role as a roguish Broadway producer. Seldom cluttering up its story with the facts, Irish Eyes are Smiling is chiefly a showcase for the superb singing of Dick Haymes. The film was produced by legendary journalist Damon Runyon, which should surprise several citizens more than somewhat.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8GXrFlNX3zzy4sOdy2TpWl2VeNu.jpg", "actors": ["Monty Woolley (Edgar Brawley)", "June Haver (Mary O'Neill)", "Dick Haymes (Ernest R.
