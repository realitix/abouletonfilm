It was a multi layered tale, somewhat all characters were connected, but all the story centers around the same theme and that is sexual fantasies. What happens when mismatch in desire get together for life. Counselling is the part of recovery nowadays, but everything lies in the effort that put on the practical side. So this movie takes such a wonderful journey with one less than half a dozen of pairs rides towards seeking solutions and answers for their wish. But the thing is, like the most of the movie's punchline say 'how far would you go for it?' is the movie that reveals to us.\r\n\r\nIt was a brilliantly written for the screen and so the actors, who did their parts impeccably. The narration was so distinct in each tale and also had very good twists before the wrap up. It was a better movie than most of the sex comedies that we got fooled for its promotions. I won't surprise if Hollywood or other film industry remake it. Why do we need to read 'Kama Sutra' while this movie is out there. Definitely there won't be a better movie for adults to enjoy whole heartily, especially not recently as I'm aware. Finally, without minors around, but for ourself to have a great time. Don't think it is a build-up because it delivers a good entertainment with lots of 'laugh out lauds'.\r\n\r\n''Also, I'm required by federal law to inform you that I am a convicted sex offender.''\r\n\r\nHonest, brave, funny, lust, awkward, the story adds up in a variety of things except there is no true spice like really spicy. Because its want to tickle you than taking up everything seriously. That's why the movie clicked very well, even though the story leaps were very tight because of the many layers to cover. All the five tales ends in (around) three random displays of the acts. The first one for the intro, then where the problem arises and ends with the solutions and twists.\r\n\r\nI would love to have part 2, not the follow up because I want new sex related words from its dictionary with freshened pairs. The 'phone sex' part was everyone's favourite. Its the talk of the movie related blog, reviews, database, IRC and apps, and I as well loved it. That does not mean other characters and stories are weaker than this one. The 'rape', 'role play' and others are all so good too. Different viewers enjoy different type, that is according to close to their sex fantasies from one of these, I believe. So are you ready for 'the little death'?."}], "recommandations_id": [253283, 261820, 230428, 157829], "youtube_key": "BnnhesQ8Rxc"}
