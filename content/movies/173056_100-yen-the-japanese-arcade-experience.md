Five story buildings filled with arcade cabinets, old and new, inundate the streets. Welcome to downtown Tokyo, Japan. A place where the arcades of the 80s and 90s not only still exist, but thrive and have evolved into an elaborate, unmatchable gaming experience. 100 Yen is a historical documentary about the evolution of arcades and the culture surrounding it - from the birth of arcades to the game centers that still thrive today. With a predominant focus on the three major arcade genres, Shooting games, Fighting games and Rhythm games, 100 Yen explores the culture and evolution of arcades through the past and present. Featuring interviews with industry professionals, game programmers and designers, casual gamers and gaming icons from Japan, Canada, and the USA.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fXYuJR1iel7imZXjaV9P7FqqhzL.jpg", "actors": ["Brian Ashcraft (Himself)", "Daigo Umehara (Himself)", "Aaron Chmielowiec (Himself)", "Mike Ross (Himself)", "Justin Wong (Himself)", "Hiro Kawagchi (Himself)", "Seth Killian (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [55426, 55430, 39458, 72037], "youtube_key": "ZyyLPgGYcV8"}
