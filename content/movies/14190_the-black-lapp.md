Karl killed his ex-wife and threw her newborn coloured child into the sea when he discovered that she obviously had been unfaithful. Now Karl is being haunted by her ghost and is developing a serious drinking problem. Anna is looking for the love of her life, but there aren't many bachelors around - until they discovers another small family on the other side of the mountain. They meet a semi-alcoholized widow on Karl's age, her son Peder, and her black adopted son, Ante, that arrived from the sea on a piece of wood.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/47ZsOKglfi9mhUYICDhswcC77Gf.jpg", "actors": ["Kingsford Siayor (Ante)", "Eirik Junge Eliassen (Peder)", "Bj\u00f6rn Granath (Presten)", "Kjersti Lid Gullv\u00e5g (Anna)", "Thor-Inge Gullv\u00e5g (Karl)", "Guri Johnson (Ellen Margrethe)", "Frank J\u00f8rstad (Normann H\u00e6tta Bongo Utsi Saus)", "Isaka Sawadogo (Faren)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [18132, 12167, 10751, 45615], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
