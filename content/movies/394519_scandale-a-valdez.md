Jean-Michel Cousteau, son of Jacques Cousteau, takes us on a voyage to investigate first-hand the devastating impact of the U.S.'s largest oil spill. Amid the majestic mountains and ice floes of this serene setting, the leaking oil spreads like a virus staining and often killing everything it encounters. Harbor seals, sea otters, and bald eagles fall victim to the tragic accident.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jean-Michel Cousteau (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
