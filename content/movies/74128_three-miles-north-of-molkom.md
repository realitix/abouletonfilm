Once a year, their gates open to a thousand international participants, placed in 'Sharing Groups' at random. A Swedish celebrity, a Californian hippy, a Finnish grandmother and a back-packing Australian rugby coach, who stumbled on the wrong party, are amongst the group that take us on an unforgettably quirky, two-week emotional roller-coaster. Firewalking, Shamanism, Tantric Sex and myriad other physical, psychological and esoteric experiences, guide our unlikely heroes towards enlightenment, love, loathing and themselves. Will they ever be the same again?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4ps1Mj7jeJ3r0UAjDdGmEzOZIJC.jpg", "actors": ["Regina Lund (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
