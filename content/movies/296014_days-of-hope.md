With blank holes in their skulls and blackened skin, they fall prey for grave robbers specializing in illegal immigrants jumping the makeshift boats sailing up to Sicily.  Those who manage to hold on to life on the boisterous waters embark on an equally dangerous journey to mainland Europe. Following the paths of immigrants balancing their lives in the shadow economy, this film unlocks a merciless narrative echoing the existential fright and the ceaseless longing for loved ones. Instead of plainly appealing to empathy, it confronts the viewers with the universal fear of abandonment and lonesomeness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mRLCi9wfcM9WJK7d8vd4GD9WZd6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
