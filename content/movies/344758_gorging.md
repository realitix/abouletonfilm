Relatively obscure, the sport was brought to the mainstream in 2003 with the news of Aron Ralston who had severed his own arm while trapped in a canyon. Experiencing an overnight spike in popularity by the late 90s - a result of information appearing on the internet - the sport became inundated with thrill-seekers of all backgrounds and skill levels. Facing a new era of off-the-couch recreationalists, three influential participants, a canyoneering instructor, pioneer, and guidebook author each respond to a growing interest in the incredibly dangerous activity. Gorging employs the story of canyoneering to examine larger questions about the pursuit of thrills and the consequences that follow.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sSrhWr4h2HyNqbw0aNxjHrscKp5.jpg", "actors": ["Mike Kelsey (Himself - The Guidebook Author)", "Steve Cabourne (Himself - The Recreationalist)", "Dennis Turville (Himself - The Pioneer)", "Rich Carlson (Himself - The Founder of the ACA and Instructor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
