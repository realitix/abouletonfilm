For just a moment, generally counted in minutes, the world is a frozen arrow pointing at the thought of something important, so important that it should never be forgotten. As a meditative memento on the importance of a collective memory, we have compiled a series of these moments into a film. Together these sampled minutes of silence reflect one of few activities that bring people together regardless of religion, race or cultural background.\r The archival material outlines a mute history of tragedy and grief, often staged against a backdrop of natural disasters and violent conflict. But the footage is also a reminder of the stoic nature of humans, never accepting the horrors of terror attacks, war or rogue killers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dMLzWJZadWYqi74FNYmrFqNnoqV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
