Dat Kho, who's cast includes the beloved Vietnamese inconic anti-war songwriter/poet/artist Trinh Cong Son (1939-2001) who posthumously won the World Peace Music Award in 2004, is a story of the love of family, love of homeland, love of the culture and language of Vietnam and the ethereal love of the ingenue daughter for her fiance, foiled by the antagonistic forces of the ever-present war. A thought-provoking film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ebxNWi3AWhxLNoOBdjafjjsaw9b.jpg", "actors": ["Hop Bich ()", "C\u00f4ng S\u01a1n Tr\u1ecbnh  (Trinh Quan)", "Nguyen Dot Luu ()", "Quynh Van ()", "Ha Yuan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
