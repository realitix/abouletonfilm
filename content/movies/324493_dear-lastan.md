In 1969, it created Lastan. For hundreds of thousands of children Lastan was a mythical hero who helped unhappy and confused little souls. Each child imagined him differently and felt confident to share with him what they could not confess to anyone else: Dear Lastan, I kissed him, am I pregnant?; Dear Lastan, I fell in love with a boy from my class... For decades Lastan was a legend and the best kept secret in journalism. This film, for the first time after almost five decades, reveals his true identity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qhk5CQkZBTEfYJMSRMgO2AGN54m.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
