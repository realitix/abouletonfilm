From Nazi party rallies to the final days inside Hitler's bunker, this sensational film shows how Adolf Hitler rose from being a failed artist to creating a world of ponderous kitsch and horrifying terror. Hitler worshipped ancient Rome and Greece, and dreamed of a new Golden Age of classical art and monumental architecture, populated by beautiful, patriotic Aryans. Degenerated artists and inferior races had no place in his lurid fantasy. As this riveting film shows, the Nazis went from banning the art of modernists like Picasso to forced euthanasia of the retarded and sick, and finally to the persecution of homosexuals and the extermination of the Jews.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zwGBLAwjtld90DXh1hE4sKnp4PV.jpg", "actors": ["Bruno Ganz (German narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
