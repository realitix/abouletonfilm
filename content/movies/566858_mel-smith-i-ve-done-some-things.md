Far more than a comic actor, Smith also wrote and edited a host of celebrated TV comedies in the 1980s and 90s. He was a theatre and film director, and as a TV producer he was responsible for several innovative comedy series. Friends and colleagues, including Griff Rhys Jones, John Lloyd and Richard Curtis, talk about Smith's talents, both in front of- and behind the camera. The programme also traces his time at Oxford and, before that, Latymer Upper School, where Smith's talents were first spotted.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rWBykNaZpCdi5grlB3UYNP4zpWu.jpg", "actors": ["Mel Smith (Himself (Archive Footage))", "Rebecca Front (Narrator (Voice))", "Griff Rhys Jones (Himself)", "John Lloyd (Himself)", "Rowan Atkinson (Himself)", "Richard Curtis (Himself)", "Rory McGrath (Himself)", "Kevin McNally (Himself)", "Bob Goody (Himself)", "Stephen Poliakoff (Himself)", "Jon Plowman (Himself)", "Fulke Johnson Houghton (Himself)", "James Gay-Rees (Himself)", "Peter Brewis (Himself)", "Chris Hammond (Himself)", "Geoff Lavers (Himself)", "Peter Fincham (Himself)", "Nicky Kentish Barnes (Himself)", "Anthony Pye-Jeary (Himself)", "David Tupman (Himself)", "Michael Robinson (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
