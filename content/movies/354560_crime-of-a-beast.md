Mazy Hui (UN BAISER VOLE's Natalie Ng Man-yan, badly miscast), but she is too distraught to offer any leads. Flashbacks reveal her assailant to be Sin Ho-fun (Samuel Leung Cheuk-moon), a homely, put-upon crew member, whom Mazy tried to help via a free discussion session in her office. The paranoid and delusional Sin soon misinterprets one of her comments and, later that day, drugs and rapes the woman, the first in a series of assaults he perpetrates. Once she has recovered, Mazy and Wong join forces in order to apprehend Sin, who has now graduated to murder.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hHPqlULbU1tQUH72QAeoWgyqrXI.jpg", "actors": ["Grace Lam (Siu Mei)", "Natalie Ng (Macy S.
