This documentary uses interviews and newsreel footage to examine the conflict between the French and the Vietnamese. In addition to Vietnam, French Indochina also included Cambodia and Laos. The French-Indochina War lasted from 1946 to 1956, when a Geneva Conference agreement mandated a cease-fire in a temporarily divided Vietnam. It is well to note that it is only after this time that the two Vietnams went to war against each other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1a1gtcGjJ46p43x1fTK4k2K5AKG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
