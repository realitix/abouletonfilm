A small group of Norwegian sailors loosely connected to the British navy take refugees from Norway to Shetland in small fishing-boats, equipped only with low-caliber weapons to protect themselves from German airplanes and patrol-boats. The film is closely based on real events, and many of the members of the gang, including the leader, called \"Shetlands-Larsen\" play themselves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4oQhhfwBM0deHgIcDh4TceUKVhq.jpg", "actors": ["Leif Larsen (Himself)", "Palmar Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8y (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
