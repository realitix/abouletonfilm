The resulting images that infect the screen produce unimaginable effects on self and psyche. Vibrations of varying hues create a dialogue with subconscious languages and longings of which many of us remain blissfully unaware. The hand absorbs the light. Obscures, darkens. An opaque appearance in the field of light materializes the light. Discloses its light-ness. For light itself is not enough to show this. For light to show this it must be obscured, covered-over, withheld. It must be stopped, stopped-up, stopped-down in order to achieve the point of clearest resolution.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hBKMzdyAZiqcaEvcR48HmEfqLAA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
