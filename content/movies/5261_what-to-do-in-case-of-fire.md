At the end of the 80s they went their separate ways with the exception of Tim and Hotte, who have remained true to their ideals and continue to fight the issues they did as a group. In 2000, with Berlin as Germany's new capital, an event happens forcing the group out of existential reason to reunite and, ultimately, come to grips with the reason they separated 12 years ago.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mwArzIF6kOjBUM1CyfvQOBvdpTc.jpg", "actors": ["Til Schweiger (Tim)", "Martin Feifel (Hotte)", "Sebastian Blomberg (Maik)", "Nadja Uhl (Nele)", "Matthias Matschke (Terror)", "Doris Schretzmayer (Flo)", "Klaus L\u00f6witsch (Manowsky)", "Devid Striesow (Henkel)", "Barbara Philipp (Pritt)", "Aykut Kayac\u0131k (B\u00fclent)", "Hubert Mulzer (Polizei Chef)", "Oliver Mommsen (Konrad)", "This Maag (Schmitz)", "Johanna von Halem (Agency Assistant)", "Sandra Nedeleff (Real Estate Agent)", "Hanna Rudolph (Malerin)", "Jamie Schuricht (Melli)", "Tim-Owe Georgi (Undersecretary of State)", "Franz Gr\u00f6ning (Staatsanwalt)", "Paula Paul (Journalistin)", "Bernd Marszahn (Kaufhausdetektiv)", "Torsten Buchsteiner (Taxifahrer)", "Dieter Dost (1.
