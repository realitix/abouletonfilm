He speaks with people about the horror that hopefully nears its end and the prospects if both sides disarm, stressing the need of socio-economic reform, especially alternatives for the coca plant farming and land redistribution. He also shows the vibrant country, rich in natural resources and budding tourism potential, so far crippled by its persisting, yet dated crime records image.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
