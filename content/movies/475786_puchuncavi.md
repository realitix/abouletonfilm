This is in contrast to the more recent industrial development of the area that includes copper refineries, steam power plants and a lading port. The lading port and its immediate environment could be regarded as the intersection of the site Puchuncav\u00ed.  The concept of this film is an ongoing project that grows every year with new blocks of fragments, all fragments are mostly consisting of one shot or edited in the camera and in the editing table and exploring the different stratas of this place.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7UmJerdJjQNL11UAKYVGjJHX2aW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
