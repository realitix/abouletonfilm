It is a compelling history of the devastating early days of the epidemic in NYC, when men with \"GRID\" were a stigmatized population that died swiftly of a terrifying new disease. Few concepts have had as great an impact on sexuality over the past 28 years as that of \"safer sex.\" Yet, as a concept, it is important to remember two things: first, safer sex had to be invented amidst an alarming lack of information that existed before the discovery of HIV in 1984; and second, safer sex as a concept had to be sold by the persistent and creative persuasion of community based groups all across the country.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qcu9AEUTKrxdgmLZp5IRjinf64L.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Shernoff (himself)", "Kenyon Farrow (himself)", "Cynthia Gomez (herself)", "Maxine Wolfe (herself)", "Anne-Christine d'Adesky (herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "NBALp4x28lo"}
