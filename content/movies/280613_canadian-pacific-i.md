The camera frames a window with a railway yard in the foreground, a bay in the space behind it, and misty mountains in the extreme distance. Trains occasionally pass by in the foreground. Huge ships move across the bay. Blue mists hover over the mountain heads.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eHxHVAzfnKLbPpq2pvDoQ2wR3iB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
