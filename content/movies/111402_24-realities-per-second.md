They accompanied him to film premieres and public appearances, radio interviews and photo shoots; they observed him as he scouted locations, directed actors on the set, and made final cuts in the editing room. In between, on long train and car rides, Haneke spoke candidly about his childhood, his transition to filmmaking, and his views on cinema, discussing films that inspired him and his own work (he counts The Seventh Continent and 71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance among his favorites). What emerges in this insightful documentary is a portrait of a dedicated filmmaker, a charming yet elusive figure in thrall to cinema and the constant perfection of his craft.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5dzDYFJJBgFHv7RXlEZePBsNPR9.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Haneke (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
