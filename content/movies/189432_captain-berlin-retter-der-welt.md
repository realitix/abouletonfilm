In this film, Buttgereit himself plays Captain Berlin in a yellow jumpsuit with red briefs worn on the outside, capped off by a Spiderman mask and a repurposed flag worn as a cape. Clearly the product of a punk sensibility slamming head-on into a love of the 1960s \"Batman\" teevee show. The film is funny to watch but low on stuff like \"production values,\" \"plot,\" and \"sense.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7zD6vkbhQ16SWkipIBwehsohHoj.jpg", "actors": ["Bela B.
