Led by the inimitable Bob The Bear Hite, a huge man with a personality to match, they established themselves as one of the greatest white blues bands of all time. This concert from Montreux in 1973, their only appearance at the festival, captures them at their peak, and features a guest appearance from Clarence Gatemouth Brown.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sJZlJlNPauSu9fcPJhwROxPYGWi.jpg", "actors": ["Fito De la Parra (Himself)", "Bob Hite (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
