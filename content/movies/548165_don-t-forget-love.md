It seems to Marina that her ordinary life is already over until she accidentally meets Nikita. The young man falls instantly in love with Marina and will do anything to be with her. Marina loves Nikita too but is more than aware of the 17-year age gap between them.  Nikita does not see their difference in age as an obstacle and is ready to marry Marina immediately. But Marina is afraid for their future and worried that people will disapprove. She hesitates and runs back to her hometown where her parents introduce her to their new neighbour Igor, a decent and responsible man, who is the same age as Marina. He too falls in love with her, and she agrees to marry him, but will Nikita let go of the woman he loves so easily?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jLHTqZupSB4uW23omGShugkb9NG.jpg", "actors": ["NATALIA ANTONOVA ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
