An observation and diagnosis of the modern Japanese metropolis: the singularity of unusual creative individuals is merely a response to the majority Japanese society. Even this can appear as an eccentric work of art. So where do the borders lie? A psychologist talks about the autistic way of life burgeoning in the dense population of the country. A noise musician speaks of her inspiration from sado-masochistic bondage as an art form.  A stirring film testimony about music and much else besides, with images spanning inconsolable anxiety and meditative tranquility. Tokyo, Noise music, S&amp;M, homosexuality, photography,... all in one bizarre but quite interesting avant-garde documentary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xYRZBam6wTI6JZdtAMEaxbP4gDB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
