A true cultural phenomenon, Up with People performed in 47 languages to a global audience that included popes and kings; they even performed at the Super Bowl half-time show. As former members offer heartfelt reflections on their time with Up with People and what the group really mean to them personally, the viewer is presented with a thought-provoking glimpse into the cultural underbelly of politics, cults, and money.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mvyssu8oDg4rbbsg8aLD1gYYdm4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "v5lkKQUp81Y"}
