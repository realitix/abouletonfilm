An independent memoir written, directed and produced by an American who worked in Ma's company for eight years, Crocodile in the Yangtze captures the emotional ups and downs of life in a Chinese Internet startup at a time when the Internet brought China face-to-face with the West.  Crocodile in the Yangtze draws on 200 hours of archival footage filmed by over 35 sources between 1995 and 2009. The film presents a strikingly candid portrait of Ma and his company, told from the point of view of an \u201cAmerican fly on a Chinese wall\u201d who witnessed the successes and the mistakes Alibaba encountered as it grew from a small apartment into a global company employing 16,000 staff.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/71WhQLHJi23VyPqATULB0AmAjXc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "FHlT3QxMqCs"}
