Ses moyens : devenir champion du monde de boxe, conqu\u00e9rir la fille de son patron (banquier respectable de la nouvelle bourgeoisie de San Francisco) et \u00eatre un grand acteur shakespearien. Cela para\u00eet trop, mais son optimisme, la croyance en ses moyens ainsi que son talent le feront triompher de tout. Supr\u00eame victoire : il aura appris la modestie (ce qui lui ouvrira le c\u0153ur d'Alexis Smith) : voir la sc\u00e8ne o\u00f9 Sullivan, le champion sortant et battu, lui remet sa ceinture. Corbett, devenu humble, lui rendra le plus beau des hommages.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wM3WIjKuqtySSi4HImNAD25vrbX.jpg", "actors": ["Errol Flynn (James J.
