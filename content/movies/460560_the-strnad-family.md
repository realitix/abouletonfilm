For the most of the time, the couple cares for common daily life issues and joys that come together with raising the children, running the household or running a business. And this is exactly the life of furniture shop owners Ivana and Vaclav Strnadovi, 2 characters that a director Helena Trest\u00edkov\u00e1 follows with her camera as of the year 1980 within a project The Marriage Story.
