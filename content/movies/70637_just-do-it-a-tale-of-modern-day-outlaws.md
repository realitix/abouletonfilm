With unprecedented access, Emily James spent over a year embedded in activist groups such as Climate Camp and Plane Stupid, documenting their clandestine activities. Torpedoing the tired cliches of the environmental movement, Just Do It introduces you to a powerful cast of mischievous and inspiring characters who put their bodies in the way.

Their adventures will entertain, illuminate and inspire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u8HzuuHkAXuK7UWAew1cM3esuCT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [262713, 207381, 212129, 53716], "youtube_key": "zavTd31qxho"}
