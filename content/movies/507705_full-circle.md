The journey of the pole began a hundred years ago when it was removed by the Harriman Expedition from the deserted village of Gash at Cape Fox. The totem pole makes its way from Cambridge, Massachusetts to Ketchikan, Alaska, where the Cape Fox community holds a ceremony to welcome home artifacts taken by the Expedition.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qUzRfg5nPUMqXksRh5YxZ9715gH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
