In 1960, the director Eino Ruutsalo spoke of the movie with these words: \"The camera moves around the night - loose images are created - they create memories, consortia in us, or do not create. Man as such is interesting. Woman for a man. Man for a woman. There is no final destiny - there are only events. Different people touch each other - nothing is too solid and not ready. Everything hovers and gets new shapes\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6B4r03VWJxJmANmjZoc8MjTPNpN.jpg", "actors": ["Yrj\u00f6 T\u00e4htel\u00e4 ()", "Lauri Haapanen ()", "Aila Kokkila ()", "Mojo Parikka ()", "Aune Sj\u00f6roos ()", "Aune Hyt\u00f6nen ()", "Yrj\u00f6 Ruutu ()", "Arvo Summanen ()", "Irja Myllyl\u00e4 ()", "Armas Kauhanen ()", "V\u00e4in\u00f6 Marttinen ()", "Severi Sepp\u00e4nen ()", "Raija Sinkkonen ()", "Crister H\u00e4kkinen ()", "Kaarlo Juurela ()", "Juha Ruutsalo ()", "Teuvo Mertens ()", "Unto Salminen ()", "Raimo J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen ()", "Lasse Aalto ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
