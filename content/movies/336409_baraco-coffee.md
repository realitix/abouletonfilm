The shop only has one regular customer, aside from a lady who orders nothing but ice water and leeches off their Internet connection. As a result, Rico is having trouble paying off his mortgage. He now has just two weeks to raise 120,000 pesos to keep the bank from foreclosing on the property. He tries a variety of things to raise the cash, even going as far as considering selling his body. Luckily, one of his baristas Jek (Miko Pasamonte) accidentally stumbles on a solution to the shop\u2019s problems. A prank goes wrong and a special ingredient ends up making their coffee a real hit among a certain section of their clientele.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5mcNVzIvkvfmAuOFXkQfxtJrrvd.jpg", "actors": ["Johnron Ta\u00f1ada ()", "Frederick Peralta ()", "Afi Africa ()", "Miko Pasamonte ()", "Marcus Aboga ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
