From working with Oscar-winning actors and making films with US$60million budgets to having actors publicly disparage him and online petitions demanding he stop making films, Boll continued to work; he has a filmography of 32 features, a career that has led to his new life as a successful high-end restauranteur. Already a cult legend, he will be remembered forever in the film world; for some, as a modern-day Ed Wood, who made films so bad, they're good, while for others, a prolific filmmaker who came from a small town in Germany and never compromised his integrity while forging his own unique Hollywood trajectory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8cwvKVNupuWIzCQcQxImdVcqjzr.jpg", "actors": ["Uwe Boll (Himself)", "Clint Howard (Himself)", "Michael Par\u00e9 (Himself)", "Guinevere Turner (Herself)", "Lindsay Hollister (Herself)", "Brendan Fletcher (Himself)", "Keith David (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "6SIXHA7vQ4A"}
