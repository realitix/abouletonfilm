With the founding of his revolutionary folk band, The Dubliners in 1962, Ronnie Drew has become synonymous with his native Dublin. September Song (2008) is an intimate portrayal of the legendary singer in which he recalls growing up in his granny's house in Dun Laoghaire, the founding of The Dubliners in O'Donoghue's pub on Merrion Row, his days of touring the world, the poignant loss of his wife of forty years, and his own battle with cancer. Featuring interviews with son Phelim, daughter Cliodhna and friends and fans Bono, Billy Connolly and Damien Dempsey.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/17E0dEnLDGMo42Tjb6B2mn7keQt.jpg", "actors": ["Ronnie Drew ()", "Bono ()", "Billy Connolly ()", "Phelim Drew ()", "Cliodhna Drew ()", "Phil Coulter ()", "Damien Dempsey ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
