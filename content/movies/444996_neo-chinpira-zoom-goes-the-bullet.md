He lives off of the money earned by his girlfriend and is more interested in trying to look cool than anything else. He meets Yumeko (Chikako Aoyama), an innocent but dangerous narcoleptic runaway, after she steals his car, and she soon moves in with him.  Following the assassination of a high-ranking member by the Kazama Family, Junko is called on to be the lookout while the family gets revenge. However, the other men quickly \"zoom\", or escape from their duty, leaving the task to Junko. Will he take out Kazama, or will he zoom?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1qN8VGqEJUw505ezFdbZKZokDI0.jpg", "actors": ["Sho Aikawa (Junko Mizuta)", "Chikako Aoyama (Yumeko)", "J\u00f4 Shishido (Junichi Mizuta)", "T\u00f4ru Minegishi (Hideo Yoshikawa)", "Rikiya Yasuoka (Mitsuo Kikuchi)", "Kenji Takaoka (Shinji Kazama)", "Shir\u00f4 Shimomoto (Shoji Kaneda)", "Sh\u00f4hei Yamamoto (Assassin)", "Kazuhiro Fukuzaki (Atsushi Naito)", "Ren Osugi (Kozo Yamamoto)", "Nao Asuka (Mizue)", "Minako Ogawa (Club Mama)", "Masahiko Sakata (Tattoo Master)", "Sayoko Makino (Reiko Kaneda)", "Yukino Tobita (Noriko)", "Tatsuo Yamada (Makoto Kawamura)", "Akira Shioji (Shoeshiner)", "Chisako Hara (Woman)", "K\u00f4ji Shimizu (Satake)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
