The girls are championed by a superhero named \"Panty Mask\" who shows up wearing a leather bikini and a pair of leather girls' underwear on her face. The nuns worship an ice carving of Christ which has the ability to make their soft drinks cold (which they don't share with the students).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fVSihIlx1mH5FCkmOCFo7bd1Sf6.jpg", "actors": ["Miyuki Katori (Maboroshi Panty)", "Rinako Fujitani ()", "Suzumi Hanai ()", "Chika Nakagami ()", "Michiko Zushi ()", "Yuko Yaezaki ()", "Y\u00f4ko \u00d4shima ()", "Kanako Fukaura ()", "Mayumi Satoi ()", "Misa Nakajo ()", "Misa Ch\u00fbj\u00f4 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "sG1dz-ovGPU"}
