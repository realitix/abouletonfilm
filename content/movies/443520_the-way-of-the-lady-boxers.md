As the film opens, Tong ventures into China to hunt down a band of villainous drug traffickers. Though she has been reluctantly paired up with her Mainland counterpart Chiang Hung (Sibelle Hu Hui-chung), Tong prefers to work alone, traveling incognito as a camera-happy tourist. Chiang dutifully tails her erstwhile partner, eventually saving her life from a high-kicking assassination attempt. Later, when the baddies catch up with Chiang and her, leaving her for dead, Tong saves her partner and agrees to hunt down these black-hearted villains together. Cult 1970s kung-fu star Carter Wong also makes an appearance in the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x3yVhP6Zgy6urP6IQBrSHZ1qW5X.jpg", "actors": ["Sibelle Hu (Chiang Hung)", "Sharon Yeung Pan-Pan (Superintendent Li Tong)", "Carter Wong (Captain Chiu Chie)", "Robert Mak (Wai Nan)", "Teddy Lin (Sam Ho)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
