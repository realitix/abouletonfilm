The first segment, titled \"Last Day\" finds acrimony taking precedent over amenity during a farewell party for an employee who's about to move on. A bride and the priest who's officiating her wedding get an unpleasant surprise after running away together in \"Wedding Night,\" and a woman on the CTA receives a spontaneous gift that transforms her outlook on the world (at least, momentarily) in \"Flowers\". Lastly, a family preparing for a big relocation finds the forces of the universe seemingly aligned against them in \"Move\".", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["John G.
