Sure it has the mandatory _Mad Max_ ripoffs that you find in every single post-apocalyptic movie of the past thirty years, but there is at least a single relatively original idea, and a couple of moderately interesting side characters. I can't go so far as to say that it's good, but _The Domestics_ is... Better? I guess. I'm not sure what than, but it feels an appropriate word.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"}], "recommandations_id": [381237, 449535, 458969, 472226], "youtube_key": "IrcQhTm2h2I"}
