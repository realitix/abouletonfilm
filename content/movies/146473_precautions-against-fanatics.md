One recurring young man, the first to appear, claims that he protects the horses from enthusiastic racing fans. He does not appear to be employed by the track, but seems to provide his services voluntarily. His protection from \"fanatics\" gives the film its title. The film is shot in a documentary style, but the sheer implausibility of the dialogue leaves the exact nature of the film ambiguous.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ysMJYoZMXjYl4RwdYhQMN87wurV.jpg", "actors": ["Petar Radenkovic ()", "Mario Adorf ()", "Hans Tiedemann ()", "Herbert Hisel ()", "Peter Schamoni ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [196123, 37568, 106036, 107258], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
