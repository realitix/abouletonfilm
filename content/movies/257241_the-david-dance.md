However, as his on-air alias \u2018Danger Dave,\u2019 the host of \u201cGay Talk,\u201d he\u2019s poised, witty, and every listener\u2019s best friend! His sister, Kate, a thrice divorced banker has a yen for Schumann and cats. Though successful, the siblings suffer from a secret, yet vast, sense of inadequacy.

Past and present intertwine to tell the story of a man learning to love and accept himself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cruxn6XTnVBWXElF0jCOnlmNLYy.jpg", "actors": ["Guy Adkins (Chris)", "Antoinette LaVecchia (Kate)", "Jordan Baker (June)", "Tonye Patano (Mrs. P)", "Juju Stulbach (Young Nun)", "Lauren Lopes (Margaret)", "Faith Sheehan (Young Kate)", "Joseph Westphal (Young David)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "R5SZz20YoSk"}
