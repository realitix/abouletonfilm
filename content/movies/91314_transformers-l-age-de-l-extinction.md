Or why I am gifting it three stars?\r\n\r\nIt was a free rental at Redox.\r\nI normally enjoy Mark Wahlberg movies.\r\nI love Bumblebee.  \r\n\r\nDo any of these hold water?\r\n\r\nI know one thing that doesn\u2019t hold a lot of water \u2013 the story. Does it really matter at this point in the franchise? There are good guy Transformers called Autobots and bad guy Transformers called Decepticons and standing between them are stupid humans that betray their species for profit \u2013 normally it\u2019s the U.S. Government. BUT wait \u2013 there is one hero that will change all of this and talk Optimus Prime (Autobot Boss Daddy) into fighting one last battle (for the fourth or fifth time \u2013 I\u2019ve lost count at this point) while some hot-looking woman runs around explosions in short-shorts.\r\n\r\nYou now know all you need to know about the entire _Transformer_ franchise.\r\n\r\nFor this incarnation we trade out Shia LeBeouf for Mark Wahlberg and Courtney Fox for Nicola Pelz. And now for the twist\u2026wait for it\u2026 Mark Wahlberg plays Nicola Pelz\u2019s FATHER.  That\u2019s right \u2013 the FATHER. Yeah, it totally doesn\u2019t work. At all.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a point in the movie about 90 minutes in where it looks like all the loose ends are going to get tied up and I thought:  You know, that wasn\u2019t so bad. Good action flick, a bit hoaky at points but watchable.\r\n\r\nAnd then the movie keeps going. And going. For another 90 minutes. And you basically watch the movie again except instead of it being in Texas and Chicago, it\u2019s in China and Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s too long, too many explosions, too many American flags and Texas flags in the background. This movie desperately needs an editor or it needs to be euthanized. Probably the latter.\r\n\r\nJohn Goodman and Ken Watanabe lend their voices serve as decent comic relief but there\u2019s not a lot that can save this film.  Bumblebee deserved better."}], "recommandations_id": [38356, 8373, 98566, 1858]}
