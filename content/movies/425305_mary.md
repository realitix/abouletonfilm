Shot in slo-mo like a glossy shampoo commercial, Miss Chief Eagle Testickle, stars in her first foot fetish video. Once again oozing sex and irreverence, Miss Chief revisits the Prince of Wales' visit to Montreal in 1860 to challenge the meaning of surrender within Aboriginal treaties with the crown.
