There\u2019s what looks at first like a normal sexual triangle: a girl, Pumpgirl, who works in the local garage and thinks she\u2019s one of the lads; a freewheeling jack-the-lad, Hammy, who\u2019s in love with no-one but himself; and a woman, Sinead, neglected, lonely, out looking for a joyride of her own. Three people, one night; a night of sex and violence, resulting in consequences - and not just for them alone.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Gerard Murphy (Shawshank)", "Geraldine Hughes (Sinead)", "Samantha Heaney (Pumpgirl)", "Richard Dormer (Hammy)", "Peter Ballance ()", "Alexandra Ford (Deirdre)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
