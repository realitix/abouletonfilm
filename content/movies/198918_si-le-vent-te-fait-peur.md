Claude and Pierre are brother and sister yet it is apparent early on that they are physically attracted to each other. In order to suborn their feelings they enter into relationships with others but nothing they do seems to work - they are always drawn back to their same fatal attraction.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5PcbSceNyopz07Z8w3yhUfD8yJH.jpg", "actors": ["Elisabeth Dulac (Claude / sister)", "Guy Lesire (Pierre / brother)", "Henri Billen (Playboy)", "Anne-Marie La F\u00e8re ()", "Paul Roland ()", "Bobette Jouret ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
