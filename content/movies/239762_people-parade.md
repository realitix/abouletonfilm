One man bands, retired cowboys and Peruvian daredevils adorn the stage as the new host protects his father's legacy from a bungling step dad. Caught somewhere in between variety and verite', People Parade is the story of a new generation paying testament to it's predecessor, as well as the narrowing chasm between reality and fiction.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vR2ZAXzFkYVIOoX9BNXITPcSNOr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
