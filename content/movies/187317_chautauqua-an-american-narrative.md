The program goes briefly into the history of Chautauqua, the national Chautauqua Movement of the early 19th century, and the historic and cultural importance that Chautauqua once held. But most of the program focuses on what goes on at Chautauqua today, including a tremendous artistic community, spiritual aspects, recreation and the daily dose of educational/intellectual lectures attend by thousands of people in a large semi-outdoor amphitheater.
