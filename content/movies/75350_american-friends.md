Ashby finds he enjoys their company, particularly that of Elinor, and both the women are drawn to him. Back at Oxford he is nevertheless taken aback when they arrive unannounced. Women are not allowed in the College grounds, let alone the rooms. Indeed any liaison, however innocent, is frowned on by the upstanding Fellows.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9vk7PKppPN7NsPk23bGOmyakhls.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Palin (Rev.
