During the three-hour performance, Acconci sat in the basement of 93 Grand Street in New York, blindfolded, armed with metal pipes and a crowbar. His image was seen on a video monitor in the upstairs gallery space. Staking claim to his territory, he tries to hypnotize himself through language into an obsessive state of possessiveness.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Vito Acconci (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
