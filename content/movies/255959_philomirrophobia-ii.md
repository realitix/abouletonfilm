This year he artfully questions his own \"coming out\". He elaborates: \"I'd like to tell you about my love story. But my love story may sound really disappointing to you, because love never happened to me. I have never had any intimate relationship or intimate physical contact with anyone. I grew up determined to love the homosexual, and to accept my own sexual orientaion.\" -- Yuke Qin", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3tioLBQc1LOuiLBeYtBMbN1hr7h.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
