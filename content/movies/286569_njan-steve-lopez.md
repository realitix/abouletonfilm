Having all the inquisitiveness and misdemeanours that's typical of a virile young man, he has an extraordinary air of innocence that makes him very likeable. Being the son of a DYSP, he stays in Police quarters, with its limited space and privacy that's irksome to a teenager. Anjali (Ahaana Krishna) is his childhood friend, staying in the same Police residential area, for whom Steve realizes he nurtures more than just friendly emotions. As life begins to look more colorful and promising, Steve encounters his destiny on the street, with little warning. His innocence that's fearless and unperturbed embarks on a journey into the brutal and the vicious domain that's so strongly active in today's society.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2o5hCSRlUyzBolZ6uLSzkGywdhD.jpg", "actors": ["Farhaan Faasil (Steve Lopez)", "Ahaana Krishna (Anjali)", "Alencier Ley Lopez (George Lopez)", "Sujith Sankar (Hari)", "Vinayakan (Pratapan)", "Chinnu Kuruvila (Steve's Sister)", "James Elia (Mohanan)", "Mini K.S (Steve's Mother)", "Dr. Ambikasuthan (Steve's Grandfather)", "Anil Nedumangad (Freddie)", "Abhija Sivakala (Anjali)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [398786, 459719], "youtube_key": "WNA12z9OqmE"}
