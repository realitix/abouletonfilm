A few images of monsters were taken that were mixed with shots taken from TV, movies, and a sequence of a porn movie. Some of this material has been treated with corrosive chemicals. The monsters started a new life and it seemed that the film had been lost. But a hedgehog put an end to the nightmare and brought us back to the original fire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bOm8p1cgrwJeehZYeNh9h75mmYs.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
