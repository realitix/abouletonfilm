The long bombs, the super snaps, the team lifters. They are all here in Golden Goals. The most loved and most feared footballers over the last 35 years at their most creative up forward.

Sandy Roberts has scoured the footy archives to find the very best, the most memorable goals from the days of black & white TV through until today.
