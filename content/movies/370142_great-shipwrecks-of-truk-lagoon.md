Now scattered across the lagoon bottom, the Fujikawa Maru, Shinkoku Maru, Aikoku, Betty Bomber, and others have become undersea islands of life. Home to beautiful creatures and corals, they remain littered with recognizable cargo and weapons.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
