With different levels of experience, each volunteer must find their own way to face the challenges, the tough choices, and the limits of their idealism. \"Living in Emergency\" is a window into the seldom portrayed and less-than glamorous side of humanitarian aid work. It explores a world that is challenging, complex, and fraught with dilemmas - the struggles, both internal and external, that aid workers face when working in war zones and other difficult contexts.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4fHlraq0KAlrNW10PCQWaVJDye9.jpg", "actors": ["Davinder Gill (Himself)", "Chris Brasher (Himself)", "Tom Krueger (Himself)", "Chiara Lepora (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
