Once, a devastating flood hits a nearby village and he goes there to minister to the affected people. At this time, he happens to rescue a Muslim child, Husain, whose entire family has been wiped out. He raises the boy as his own, alongside his own son, Ajay. As a good Hindu, he decides to raise the boy in the religion of his own parents, and Husain thus grows up to be a practising Muslim living in the backdrop of a Hindu household. Everyone loves the new addition to the household and Husain also is deeply attached to his new family.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Kanwaljit Singh ()", "Pradeep Kumar ()", "Madhu Chanda ()", "Shreeram Lagoo ()", "Jalal Agha ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
