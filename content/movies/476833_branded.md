Then one day he's astounded to receive a letter, purportedly from Edwin. The letter states Edwin now lives in the distant village shown on the enclosed map. At first, Alexander dismisses the letter as a hoax but there's something about the letter that rings true. He treks through a hard and hostile land that at long last opens up into a tranquil village. There, he's stunned to confront the impossible: his brother is very much alive. Alexander is overjoyed to see his brother but he is tormented as he knows he has killed him. Now Alexander must root out the truth -- whatever the consequences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gKCFe1PC1MoOXjVSolOat9jMRDA.jpg", "actors": ["Jeremy London (Alexander)", "Jason London (Edwin)", "Susan Duerden (Kate)", "Masiela Lusha (Donna)", "Lee Perkins (Judge Baxter)", "Burton Perez (Zee)", "Gregory Chandler Maness (Jim)", "Tess Kartel (Lena)", "Sean Riggs (Douglas)", "Matt Thompson (Evan)", "Juliet Reeves (Prisoner)", "Shelby Lyon (Young Girl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
