Dax is dark and lean.  She's an experienced woman who knows what she likes; he's young and eager to learn.  Now you can get to know this exuberant husband and wife in a uniquely intimate way.  \"Xana and Dax: When Opposites Attract\" has a feeling of openness, expansiveness.  There's no doubt that Xana and Dax are putting on a show for each other (they say as much) but they're also putting on a show for us; and in both cases it's clearly a performance they're thrilled to be giving.  They're utterly unabashed in the carnality of their love for each other, and eager to share that love with us.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ycnyCnOCksTPvz1ovJkrEONyv2V.jpg", "actors": ["Xana Star ()", "Dax Star ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
