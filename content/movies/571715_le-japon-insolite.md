Without the benefit of interviews or analyses of what is passing before one's eyes on the screen, the parade of Japanese scenes seems to take place at some distance -- making the viewer a definite outsider with no friendly interpreter to ground his or her perspective.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/psvTOGZVDTYE4YbepsqOR6qmqIr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
