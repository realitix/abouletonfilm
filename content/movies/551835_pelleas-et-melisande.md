He marries her and brings her back to the castle of his grandfather, King Arkel of Allemonde. Here M\u00e9lisande becomes increasingly attached to Golaud\u2019s younger half-brother Pell\u00e9as, arousing Golaud\u2019s jealousy. Golaud goes to excessive lengths to find out the truth about Pell\u00e9as and M\u00e9lisande\u2019s relationship, even forcing his own child, Yniold, to spy on the couple. Pell\u00e9as decides to leave the castle but arranges to meet M\u00e9lisande one last time and the two finally confess their love for one another. Golaud, who has been eavesdropping, rushes out and kills Pell\u00e9as. M\u00e9lisande dies shortly after, having given birth to a daughter, with Golaud still begging her to tell him \u201cthe truth\u201d.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fNeQjMsOGffCKzE3hyo4fiylM1D.jpg", "actors": ["Maria Ewing ()", "Pell\u00e9as Francois ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
