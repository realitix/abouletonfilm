Marine scientist Marcus Eriksen invited onboard an unusual crew to help him study the sea: renowned surfers Keith &amp; Dan Malloy, musician Jack Johnson, spearfisher woman Kimi Werner, and bodysurfer Mark Cunningham become citizen scientists on a mission to assess the fate of plastics in the world\u2019s oceans.  After years of hearing about the famous \u201cgarbage patches\u201d in the ocean\u2019s gyres, the crew is stunned to learn that the patches are a myth: the waters stretching to the horizon are clear blue, with no islands of trash in sight. But as the crew sieves the water and sorts through their haul, a more disturbing reality sets in: a fog of microplastics permeates the world\u2019s oceans, trillions of nearly invisible plastic shards making their way up the marine food chain. You can clean up a garbage patch, but how do you stop a fog?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ssQuWdVGpDAlRklfdLGOl6ChMPj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "jXURG3meS-Q"}
