Worst of all their deviances now, is anyone who dares to consume or even touch the sweet-tasting 'Chisa' flower. Once caught, they are permanently banished from the village, and made to live a life of solitude and poverty. Most prone to this deviance are children - known by elders as 'vessels for evil' - since their natural curiosity makes them prey to temptation. Yet these rejected children, left to their own devices, free and as wild as the wind, are discovering the true power of this plant and its teachings. Its sap contain what most adult fear: a vision of the truth. They have learned so much that some villagers even accuse these children of witchcraft.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v1RCvoB6HQlBNJGwsIWTopgptD5.jpg", "actors": ["Thiago Stampone ()", "Ismael Stampone ()", "Cristian Cavo ()", "Oscar Mira ()", "Oscar Molinari ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "iz85pLeJ0WE"}
