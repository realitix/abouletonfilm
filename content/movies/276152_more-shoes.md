A few years ago I was creatively adrift, looking to do something in film but unhappy with what I'd tried so far.  Then I happened upon Werner Herzog's comment that aspiring filmmakers shouldn't bother going to film school. Instead, he said, they should make a journey alone, on foot, for five thousand kilometers, \"let's say from Madrid to Kiev\". This journey, he claimed, would teach one the essential nature of cinema.  I decided to take Herzog's words literally and walk from Madrid to Kiev. MORE SHOES is the resultant filmed record of that journey. It's the story of who I met, what I saw, and how the whole experience changed me.  The film premiered at Slamdance 2008 and went on to play 25 festivals worldwide, winning \"Best Documentary\" honors at three of them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9eQ5zJPnzioxqwfFwPs2Dv0GvQO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
