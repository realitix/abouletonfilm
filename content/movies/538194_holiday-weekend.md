A young couple quibbles over an impulsive decision to steal a coffee machine, while the victimized pair sans Sanka plays an unusual game of affection and abuse. A young man with werewolf-ism moves in with a fledgling songwriter, while elsewhere, an injured individual with Tourettes seeks council from a high priced lawyer. All the while, some elderly homosexual lovers reunite, dancing to celebrate the rekindling of their long dormant love. Giving us his spin on spirituality and the afterlife, Holiday Weekend is like several small sketches that add up to one incredible portrait.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/46l7MaAyEtUsl722EwDKAwfQbL9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
