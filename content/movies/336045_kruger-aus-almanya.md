When his beloved, doting granddaughter Annie plans to marry Deniz, an ambitious student and waiter in Ankara who needs a visa for Germany, backward Paul and his buddy, publican Karin, go on Turkish 'holiday' so he can talk her out of it. But Deniz proves her only choice and probably a right one, even if countrymen and family win Paul's heart, as well as a resourceful preteen-thief, who proves an orphaned Syrian refugee. Paul even promises to plead with his counterpart, Deniz's family patriarch, who opposes him marrying a Christian infidel at pain of expulsion from the close clan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nwdA05eGucom4b2OTpswrapjvyL.jpg", "actors": ["Horst Krause (Paul Kr\u00fcger)", "J\u00f6rg Gudzuhn (Eckhardt)", "Gilbert von Sohlern (Herr Merseburger)", "Victoria Trauttmansdorff (Frau Merseburger)", "Floriane Daniel (Susanne)", "Caspar Fischer-Ortmann (Omar)", "Marie Gruber ()", "Fritz Roth (Bernd)", "Tim Seyfi (Murat)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [402528, 403307, 91628], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
