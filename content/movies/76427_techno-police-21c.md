The Police have lost control. The citizens are terrified... and no one can stop the madness. Even the Techno Police, a special anti-crime squad, find the situation hopeless until a wise cracking cop with an uncanny knack for out-guessing the criminals joins the force.  When a powerful experiment tank is hijacked, the Techno Police and their newest recruit go to work. Equipped with an ultra-sonic car and crime-fighting Technoids, the rookie cop sets out on a death defying high-speed chase through the streets... trying to capture the crooks and trying to stay alive.  But no one is aware of the awesome powers about to be unleashed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kOSx9A0ybsRr90DLpVIvdCp9G9r.jpg", "actors": ["Kumiko Takizawa (Fubuki Eiena)", "Yoshito Yasuhara (Kyosuke Mibu)", "Junpei Takiguchi (Scratch)", "Kenji Utsumi (Goro Narumi)", "Masaru Ikeda (Kosaka Kaoru)", "Ryusuke Oobayashi (Bureda)", "Saeko Shimazu (Sukyani)", "Takeshi Aono (Jack)", "Naoko Kouda (Ayabe Marionera)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "0ChiZCpK-24"}
