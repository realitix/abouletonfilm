Beginning with scenes of an unmade, empty bed, the narration reveals that a lover has just split for good, yet an assignment to cover events in Somalia has to continue. Those \"events\" include on-going starvation and disease, refugee camps filled with the human detritus of desert warfare, and interviews with Somali militarists -- raising the issue of exactly what type of personal narration could ever successfully play off the somber and depressing Somalian conflicts -- the very concept itself seems doomed from the beginning.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/balwbQqa1x1MyhXeePDMWIsMIjJ.jpg", "actors": ["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mitterrand (Narrator (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
