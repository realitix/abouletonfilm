It's available in a variety of formats featuring a great deal of unreleased audio and video material, and featuring new stereo and surround mixes of the Sluggo! album. I've always felt the album is really good, but I've had reservations about the mix forever. It's a long story (told at length in the new liner notes in the reissue packaging), but the upshot is I'm finally completely happy with the sound of the album. Sixteen years after recording it, I finally feel like I've finished Sluggo!\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nXAHICS5lds6g1belFhKjCyytPC.jpg", "actors": ["Mike Keneally (Mike Keneally)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
