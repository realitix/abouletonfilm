Instead of containing live footage, it provides a deeper look at the 'Gettysburg (1863)', the musical trilogy that appeared on 2004's 'The Glorious Burden', as well as the Civil War battle that inspired it.  The centerpiece of the 2-DVD set is the epic three-part song itself. In addition to the normal stereo version, it appears in two different expansive and powerful 5.1-channel surround-sound mixes (a 'Metal' mix and an 'Orchestral' mix). The music can be accompanied with moving images and lyrics that help document the course of the three-day battle.  Also included in the extensive package is an in-depth video tour of the Gettysburg battlefield, an interview with Jon Schaffer, two music videos from The Glorious Burden album, and other various extras.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kXxvIv8BPFYB4BADVazEGg5rTsD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
