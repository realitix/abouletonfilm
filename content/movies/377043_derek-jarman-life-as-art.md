A good maxim for a filmmaker whose life and work is explored in this loving documentary. Avant-garde in method but nostalgic in temperament, he's remembered by family and friends like Tilda Swinton and Nigel Terry. Excellent use of Super 8 blends with revelatory stories, not least his wish to cast Terry-Thomas as Ariel in The Tempest!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8XisSqzvzAjXTQmP2HJwSyUpJxb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
