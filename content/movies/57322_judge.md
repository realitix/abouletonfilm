On the bench he encounters Qiuwu, a mechanic accused of stealing two cars. Perhaps influenced by his emotional state, the outwardly impassive judge imposes an almost-obsolete criminal law on Qiuwu that sentences him to death for his crime. Desperate to mitigate his sentence, Qiuwu agrees to donate his kidney to a rich businessman dying of a terminal illness, hoping at the very least that his impoverished family may profit from his demise.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ieueqH20GNvsHRATbJASiFpCmSc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
