While at work in prisons, community centers and schools, each woman has found theater as a way to engage a level of activism in themselves and form inclusive spaces with others to tell stories of joy or sorrow.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
