The scene eventually begins to warp and disintegrate. The result is equal parts mind-numbing and hypnotic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qshaXjzSMRs45FtR2lNj2MVt7rN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [246193, 147719, 145033, 168947], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
