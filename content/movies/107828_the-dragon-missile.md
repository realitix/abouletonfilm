When the lord (Ku Feng) suffers from a life-threatening boil on his back, he is told by the Imperial doctor that an herb called \"Longevity Rattan\" offers the only cure and is grown in a remote village by an herbalist named Tan. Lo is sent on a mission to get the herb and bring it back before it's too late (seven days). A jealous aide saddles Lo with six other fighters to accompany him, i.e. steal the herb when they get the chance and race back to the capital so the aide will get the credit. Lo doesn't trust the six and none of them trust each other. At one point, one of the six nearly botches the whole mission.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p1V0kLnnRs0RIWL4REWkZQC8fQj.jpg", "actors": ["Lo Lieh (Sima Jun)", "Tony Liu (Tieh Er Long)", "Nancy Yen Nan-See (Tan Li)", "Ku Feng (Lord Qin Quan)", "Terry Lau Wai-Yue (Miss Sha)", "Fan Mei-Sheng (Miu Fei)", "Kong Yeung (Scholar Chen)", "Norman Chu (Fang Song)", "Ko Hung (Niu Jin Sing)", "Wang Han-Chen (Peng Da Hu)", "Ou-Yang Sha-Fei (Long's mother)", "Yeung Chi-Hing (Herbalist Tan)", "Hao Li-Jen (Chief Imperial Doctor Fu)", "Lee Sau-Kei (Fisherman)", "Chan Mei-Hua (Fisherman's daughter)", "Shum Lo (Mr. Shum)", "Wong Ching-Ho (Innkeeper)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [67023, 206446, 44963, 20188], "youtube_key": "Yfi0fYz9O4U"}
