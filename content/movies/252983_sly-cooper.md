In the film, Sly learns of his birth family's secret legacy; that he comes from a long line of talented and international thieves. Endowed with this knowledge, Sly and his friends are catapulted into a global adventure as they race to reassemble pieces of an ancient book holding The Cooper Clan's family secrets before it can fall into the hands of Clockwerk -- an evil Russian metallic owl bent on ending the Cooper family line. From romantic Parisian backdrops to the lush mountains of China, gritty film noir meets bright, colorful graphic novels in this origin story of the world's greatest thief-turned-hero.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rw36cctUD5kPCNCxFYsQ7F205B8.jpg", "actors": ["Chris Murphy (Murray (voice))", "Ian James Corlett (Sly Cooper (voice))", "Matt Olsen (Bentley (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "oFNJW8AoYSs"}
