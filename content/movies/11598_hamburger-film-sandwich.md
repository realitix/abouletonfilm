Some are winners, some are flops. In retrospect they are perhaps more interesting in looking back on the 70s in a parody format. But the kung-fu parody is truly on target in what it parodies and the centerpiece of the movie. Alone I would give the kung-fu parody an 8/10 rating. Unfortunately some of the other skits drag down the whole of the movie, but it is worth it just to see the kung-fu bit.\r\n\r\nI give it 6/10\r\n\r\n**Toxic Fletch**"}], "recommandations_id": [5709, 22049, 12535, 9749]}
