The camera remained stationary at shooting and a hand-clap to synchronise sound at the start of each take is not edited out. The piece has the appearance of a film loop but it becomes clear that it is a series of different takes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sAuKHAXUYIRndpyErEg1sxnG5oU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
