Trees are ablaze with colour, and their splendor is reflected in the mirrored surfaces of the water, offering a glimpse of the landscape Lampman knew so well through the poet\u2019s eyes and words. Lampman\u2019s poem is read by broadcaster and poet George Whalley, with accompanying score by composer Eldon Rathburn.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1gHUIVxlcpjJsaci4Htb36Mf1Ja.jpg", "actors": ["George Whalley (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
