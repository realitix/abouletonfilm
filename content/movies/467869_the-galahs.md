The players were, and are, household names \u2013 Barassi, Skilton, Jesaulenko, Davis, Hart, Nicholls, Mann, Dugdale, Fraser. Most didn\u2019t own passports. Most had barely been out of Victoria. Ex-umpire and media juggernaut Harry Beitzel was the man who made it happen. He mortgaged his house. He organised the opponent. He flew his team of champions on a milk run to Darwin, Hong Kong, Paris, Dublin, London, New York and beyond to plant the seed of international competition. The Galahs is a rare feature film that reconnects fans with all time greats of both VFL and GAA football.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AnsWjim0U7YoRQr7vmqfjM5930L.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
