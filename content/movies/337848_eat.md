The diners include: A man dining alone, who orders a plate of spaghetti that becomes his dining companion. A couple; the woman talks endlessly (and unintelligibly), as her head mutates into a variety of shapes. Her ravenous companion refuses to pay, and the restaurant reclaims its food. A family with two children; they play, rather elaborately, with their food.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rglUW9KAcRa6s1TBWO6PcUHuJ3J.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
