When he brings Mammoth Studios free publicity by imitating star Lawrence Rupert's heroics, they bring him to Hollywood to generate another headline; he thinks he'll get a movie contract. Disillusioned, he haunts the casting offices, where he meets and is consoled by Phyllis Montague, bit player and stunt-woman. When Merton finally gets his \"break,\" though, it's not quite what he envisioned.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ywHaVxohNS9LtskQ3H6kThOMoWB.jpg", "actors": ["Red Skelton (Merton Gill aka Clifford Armytage)", "Virginia O'Brien (Phyllis Montague)", "Gloria Grahame (Beulah Baxter)", "Leon Ames (Lawrence Rupert)", "Alan Mowbray (Frank Mulvaney)", "Charles D.
