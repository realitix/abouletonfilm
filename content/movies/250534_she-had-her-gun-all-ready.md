Moving from a kitchen on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the film explores the dynamic between a complacent, almost catatonic Pat Place and the demonic, aggressive Lydia Lunch, ending with a showdown at the rollercoaster on Coney Island. The film utilises a linear narrative which is counterbalanced by an impressionistic view of New York, lit by green fluorescent lights, with intermittent effects added in-camera by Dick, including red filters and 'earthquakes'. The relationship between the two women is ambiguous, they may represent elements of a single identity or the influence of a stronger will over a weaker character. It is the dynamic between these two unequal forces which propels the narrative.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yr0e9gmEHtbCi0vTShPSATOgvmV.jpg", "actors": ["Pat Place ()", "Lydia Lunch ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
