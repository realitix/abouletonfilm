When he learns about the Wonderful Land Of Ha's - an amusement park with all the fixin's - and its mysterious Wizard who promises to make his dreams come true, Darby is determined to go. But when his father tells him he's needed to help with the harvest, Darby decides that nothing is going to stop him and he makes a choice that will change his life forever. With his pet dog Tutu by his side, Darby flees the farm and sets off to find the Wonderful Land Of Ha's. Along the way he meets a bored scarecrow (Mr. Lunt), a tin man (Larry the Cucumber) who wants to ride roller coasters and a lion (Pa Grape) that craves cotton candy. Each with their own dreams, they set off to see the Wizard.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1v3YlWPHxSQIl61auE1ardyPlHb.jpg", "actors": ["Lisa Vischer (Darby (Junior Asparagus) (voice))", "Phil Vischer (Bob the tomato  / Wizard (Archibald Asparagus) / Scarecrow / Farmhand 2 (Mr. Lunt) / Lion / Farmhand 3 (Pa Grape) / Munchie Mayor (Phillipe Pea) / Munchies (French Peas) / Customer (Jimmy Gourd) / Silly Song Announcer (voice))", "Mike Nawrocki (Tin Man / Farmhand (Larry the Cucumber) / Munchies (Jean-Claude) / Customer (Jerry Gourd) / Minions (voice))", "Daniel Anderson (Dad Asparagus (voice))", "Jacquelyn Ritz (Splenda (Madame Blueberry) (voice))", "Brian Roberts (Chester / Bobby Bernard / Yellow McToad / Munchies (French Peas) (voice))", "Julie Smith (Chester's Mom / Nanny / Munchies (French Peas) (voice))", "J.
