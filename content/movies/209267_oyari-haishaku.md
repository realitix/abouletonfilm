One day, in a drinking contest, he misses sending his lord off as he leaves Edo for Kuju. Released from service for this blunder, Akame becomes a wandering samurai. He goes on to steal lances from many feudal lords' processions. For Furuta, suffering defeat is out of question. To protect his domain and family, he takes it on himself to meet Murase and proposes an alliance between the Wako, Fuki and Ushizu domains. With the fate of the feudal families in their hands, Furuta and Murase pursue Akame. Each with something to protect, the men fight desperately over the lances.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g4MhZx3un0IQw7Q5y7b4262caKx.jpg", "actors": ["Naoto Takenaka (Kotoji Akame)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
