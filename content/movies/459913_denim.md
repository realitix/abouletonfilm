Through a personal trip down memory lane, visiting the places that moulded her, we learn what happens when the city changes and leaves those who built it behind. Travelling through Bermondsey, Rotherhithe, Elephant & Castle, Walworth Road, Peckham, Brixton and of course Shoreditch, 'Denim' is both a personal tale and a wider social commentary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pNGT7ohNDTNHb20oW3raxhr7n2U.jpg", "actors": ["Maya Bangura (Younger Siana)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
