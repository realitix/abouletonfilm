In the story, set in the 1950s, Hendrik Grond (Gijs Scholten van Aschat) has a good law practice, and a happy marriage which has produced a son. He is so contented that his world is completely shattered when, undetected, he catches his wife in bed with his law firm's senior partner. In fact, he has become quietly unhinged, and he arranges a series of \"accidents\" to ensure his revenge - becoming involved in the local underworld in the process. Will he succeed in committing a series of \"perfect\" crimes, or will the police inspector (Johan Simons) investigating these incidents get wise?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iMaOyNSzSSLVMra6qY3Z9Yv857l.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
