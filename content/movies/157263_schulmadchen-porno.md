The first segment is about a class of schoolgirls who tease their teacher, and seduce him after hours. Then they all go on a coach trip to some kind of youth hostel where they keep molesting him until the landlady (Henkowa) intervenes - she wants him for herself.  The second segment shows a small theatre performance in rural Bavaria. While the actors struggle with their lines, behind the scenes a lot of rumpy-pumpy is going on, and the audience notices.  In the third segment a member of the vice squad (Wolfgang Jansen) is on the hunt for some bogus priest who is notorious for molesting women at the beach.  Between segments there are some schoolgirl-report-style interviews on the street, with supposed members of the public.  beutelwolf@egafd", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/30vDSn45pO93KGJX6k25jysmCUV.jpg", "actors": ["Britt Corvin ()", "Angelika Duvier ()", "Eva Quang ()", "Gina Janssen ()", "Karin Lorson ()", "Nadia Henkowa ()", "Nadine de Rangot ()", "Richard Allan (a man at the orgy in Die Pinsel von der Liebesinsel)", "Jerry Brouer (Hostel landlord)", "Walter Feuchtenberg ()", "Detlev Heyse ()", "Wolfgang Jansen (Vice police officer)", "G\u00fcnther Kieslich (Street interviewer)", "Kurt Meinicke ()", "Ingeborg Moosholzer (befragte Person)", "Gerd Mueller (Hans Hammer)", "B\u00e4rbel M\u00f6ssinger ()", "Fritzi Ross ()", "Edgar Wenzel ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
