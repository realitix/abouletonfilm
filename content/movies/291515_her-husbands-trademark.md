Berkeley marries her, and 15 years later, though he has not realized his ambition, he keeps his wife luxuriously attired as a \"trademark\" of his prosperity. Allan, who has obtained a large tract of oil land from the Mexican Government, visits the Berkeleys; and James, hoping to profit from his wealth, goes to Mexico with him, accompanied by Lois, who unwillingly agrees to help her husband. When Allan and Lois realize their love for each other, James, refusing to become angry, is denounced by his wife. A band of Mexican bandits attempt to capture Lois, and in the attack James is slain. Allan rescues Lois, and they escape across the border.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/utyMysaqmnaL8cUwULjLFmjf829.jpg", "actors": ["Gloria Swanson (Lois Miller)", "Richard Wayne (Allan Franklyn)", "Stuart Holmes (James Berkeley)", "Lucien Littlefield (Slithy Winters)", "Edythe Chapman (Mother Berkeley)", "Charles Ogle (Father Berkeley)", "Clarence Burton (Mexican Bandit)", "James Neill (Henry Strom)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
