However after seeing this I'm not so sure it should have ever been released. I suppose it shows that comedians can have an 'off' night and that was certainly the case. Maybe it was the camera's, maybe a small crowd to feed off. From what I guessed, I'm sure the crowd didn't know what was going on. Not really funny and it seems like a berate the audience show (probably like the national gay association gig). Personally it wouldn't have bothered me to skip it."}], "recommandations_id": [460626, 486331, 486334, 403665]}
