This film was filmed in 1971 but not released until 1985, on VHS. This was the first stand-up act that Pryor did before he hit the mainstream audience. With only 48 minutes of footage, it is the shortest of Pryor's stand-up routines.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yobXULDheaBtu0x5i6MMa3yFRCN.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Pryor (Himself)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "Killa-What?", "content": "I'm a fan of Pryor's live work. However after seeing this I'm not so sure it should have ever been released. I suppose it shows that comedians can have an 'off' night and that was certainly the case. Maybe it was the camera's, maybe a small crowd to feed off. From what I guessed, I'm sure the crowd didn't know what was going on. Not really funny and it seems like a berate the audience show (probably like the national gay association gig). Personally it wouldn't have bothered me to skip it."}], "recommandations_id": [460626, 47570, 486331, 461698], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
