The earliest footage was shot by D.A. Pennebaker himself, who had become good friends with Dawkins while filming the theatre group Dawkins was involved with back in the 1970s. \u201cHe offered us some 8mm cameras, but we weren\u2019t really interested back then,\u201d Dawkins recalls. \u201cThen I went to Bali and was having this unbelievable experience \u2013 I cabled Pennebaker and asked him to send me one of those cameras. He showed up in person, with 12 rolls of film, and we used it all. When I got back to New York, I saw he\u2019d put the wrong music with the wrong footage, so he asked me to sync it up for him. I didn\u2019t know anything about film back then \u2013 but I was hooked.\u201d", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
