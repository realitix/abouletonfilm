Returning from town, he finds a dog by the roadside, apparently injured by a car, and takes it home. Later, on a drunken spree, Peter is attacked by robbers, but the dog comes to his rescue and frightens the assailants away. Stirred by the unselfish devotion of his dog, Peter gradually regains his self-respect, and Dorcas falls in love with him and accepts his proposal, though she fears the dog. When Peter enters the dog in a show, another exhibitor proves to be its owner, and Peter is first parted from, then reunited with, \"his\" dog. Dorcas overcomes her fear and is united with Peter.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Joseph Schildkraut ()", "Julia Faye ()", "Crauford Kent (Mr. Gault)", "Sally Rand ()", "Robert Edeson ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
