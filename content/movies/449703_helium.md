Through this period, I became further obsessed with competitive bodybuilding, as well as discovered the balloon fetish community. This has resulted in a deep fascination as well as jealousy, and I am gazing at both communities with rapt curiosity. In my current state, I am thrilled that people not only find fulfillment and joy in activity I view as marginally futile, but can also derive such intense pleasure from otherwise innocuous objects.\"", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
