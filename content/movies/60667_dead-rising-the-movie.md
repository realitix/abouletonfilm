Produced by Capcom, the game studio that also produced the popular Resident Evil series, the Xbox 360/Wii game Dead Rising was a George Romero-inspired third-person shooting game that followed a reporter's effort to fend off a zombie attack in a mall. The game was immensely popular, expanding to downloadable content and multiple spin-off versions on other platforms. Four years later, the sequel of the game has arrived, and Capcom is hyping up the release with a live-action feature film. Directed by game producer Inafune Keiji (Onimusha, Mega Man) in his directorial debut, Shibyo Osen - Dead Rising promises to create a never-before-seen type of third-person-style action film that also features the over-the-top zombie violence that made the games so popular.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xDNSBby5sSplff1ujbZDbxYNRA.jpg", "actors": ["Sei Ando ()", "Hiroyuki Onoue ()", "Kiyohiko Shibukawa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
