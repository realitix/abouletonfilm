The only thing he has is a camera, and he stays at churches hoping people will hire him to take their photographs. During one day, he has three encounters that change his life: the first, with a smooth-talking young man who's standing by the church door who berates him for wasting his life in church, the second with a boy who offers to take his picture, and the third with a Mercedes-driving man who's been stuck in traffic and has no patience left. Is there any deliverance from the soullessness of the city?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kLNBFVKWzKwEKcYyK6M5xfVOTKI.jpg", "actors": ["Ronnie Lazaro (Photographer)", "John Arcilla (Man in Black)", "Ronnie Pulido (Child)", "Ermie Concepcion (Woman in church)", "Randy Punsal (Police Officer)", "Rolly Retirado (Police Officer)", "Nikki Umapos (Child in Church)", "Nonie Manjares (Passenger in Bus)", "Jun Pancho (Police Officer)", "Ruben Lee (Naglagay)", "Eddie Garcia (Man with gun)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "VcF9MfZlqAw"}
