After hunting whales for generations, we have brought their widespread slaughter to an end, but these graceful giants still face threats on a number of fronts, and the battle to save them goes on.  This film takes an intimate look at four types of whales: pilots, humpbacks, bowheads and orcas, through the eyes of the humans who are closest to them. From the struggle to save a pod of pilot whales in the Florida Keys to the groundbreaking work of a scientist risking life and limb in the Arctic to the controversy over military sonar, you'll go to the front lines of whale conservation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7uMXFZc9YS8PMzl9QfDoPz6nBaU.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Carroll (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
