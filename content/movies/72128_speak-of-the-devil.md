Who is Anton LaVey? Where is he from? Why does he do that? It does not take much to imagine the worst.

Anton LaVey is nothing like a horned Charles Manson, and his path is all the more unexpected. Nick Bougas allows us to discover the artist, the musician, the philosopher, all through hallucinatory images retrieved from archives, making this rare documentary only two years before the author of the Satanic Bible disappeared.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s8DRRB8UaxVPJF6JOpDOcQ8TMas.jpg", "actors": ["Anton LaVey (Himself)", "Boyd Rice (Himself)", "Adam Parfrey (Himself - Interviewer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
