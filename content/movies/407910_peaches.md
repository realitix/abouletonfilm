Ronald Sams (Wilson) has lusted after the flirtatious sexpot they call Peaches (Robinson) for a good two decades. After a chance meeting with the object of his lusty affections, the once-devoted family man becomes singularly fixated on making his deepest fantasies a reality. But what Ronald doesn't realize that despite her saccharine name and seductive smile, this stunner isn't so sweet on the inside - in fact, she's downright dangerous. Increasingly isolated from his friends and family as a result of his longtime hang-up, Ronald must now scramble to make things right with those he loves before jealousy and hurt feelings lead to long-term resentment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ts0kgbDGk4wQy9dbacgwbbzUbYs.jpg", "actors": ["Wendy Raquel Robinson (Peaches)", "Dorien Wilson (Sams)", "Dorien Wilson (Ronald Sams)", "Thomas Mikal Ford ()", "Bee-Be Smith ()", "Buddy Lewis ()", "Kimberly Bailey ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
