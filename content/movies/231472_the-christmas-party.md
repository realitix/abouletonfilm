The third directorial effort of Jari Halonen, a clearly distinctive voice in the local filmmaking landscape, is a timeless, absurd and at times completely insane piece of masculine comedy rough not only on the edges, but to the core. A story of Mike, just out of prison, and his buddies throwing a Christmas party under the most obscure circumstances is filled with juicy dialogue and plot twists that will definitely make your jaw drop \u2013 and have you chuckle for days after.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qYDjX8hxakntm5TnarttUlLnzol.jpg", "actors": ["Jorma Tommila (Bona Merenkyl\u00e4)", "Antti Reini (Mike Merenkyl\u00e4)", "Rauno Juvonen (Joukka)", "Oiva Lohtander (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen)", "Sari Havas (Lea)", "Jari Halonen (Dahlgren)", "Maija-Liisa Peuhu (downstairs neighbour)", "Jukka K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen (Hessu, downstairs neighbour)", "Iris-Lilja Lassila (Upstairs Neighbour)", "Anna-Maria Klintrup (Matinheimo, neighbour)", "Asko Sahlman (Matinheimo, neighbour)", "Thierry Noir (Jesper Rasmussen)", "Ragni Gr\u00f6nblom (gallerist)", "Jukka Hytti (second gallerist)", "M.A. Numminen (unknown)", "Aleksi Auer (child)", "Miikka Auer (child)", "Miravera Auer (child)", "Maria Isoaho (child)", "Sinikka Isoaho (child)", "Otto Siltala (child)", "Minna Parkkinen (woman in front of gallery (uncredited))", "Hanna Jokinen (clerk (uncredited))", "Heikki Ahonius (prisoner / sermon listener (uncredited))", "Marko Tiusanen (bank's customer (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
