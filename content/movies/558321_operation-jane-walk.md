The game\u2019s digital war zone is appropriated with the help of an artistic operation: Within the rules of the game\u2019s software, the militaristic environment is being re-used for a pacifistic city tour. The urban strollers avoid the combats whenever possible and become peaceful tourists of a digital world, which is a detailed replica of Midtown Manhattan. While walking through the post-apocalyptic city, issues such as architecture history, urbanism and the game developer\u2019s interventions into the urban fabric are being discussed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/meD5eJTBUYA5wEa1j20dZcWy9qg.jpg", "actors": ["Jacob Banigan (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ZbdK6S4bbFE"}
