Pretty much set in the present world scenario. The world where the internet, the social media is controlling people. If any revolution must take place, that's none other place than the virtual world. So a young woman who worked hard to get a job in a leading tech company, starts her life anew. At one end, aged and seriously ill parents, and the other end, making an unexpected leap in the workplace lead her to be a celebrity overnight. But it's only going to change her life forever, but how is to know, one must watch the film.\r\n\r\nIt was an Emma Watson's film. Tom Hanks was is an important role, but Watson led the show. Nice theme, but predictable storyline. I indeed guessed the end, which spoiled my watch. Slightly an awareness film too. Not all the technology can make life better, but sometimes opposite. Particularly, the film highlighted the privacy issue, how important it is for everyone. And at a same time, transparency too can bring a major change in society. But it all depends on the people and their professions. Surely not to be missed, despite you enjoy it or dislike it.\r\n\r\n**6/10**"}], "recommandations_id": [395992, 353491, 406990, 400710]}
