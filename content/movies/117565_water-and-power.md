More interestingly, it is also a film in the age-old tradition of city symphonies: a film about LA's foundation myths and the dreams it embodies, about its history and (grim) future, its topography and ethnography. O'Neill uses footage from several classic films to recreate the several layers of meaning emanating from the city, juxtaposing images and fantasies and hardly ever allowing one picture to go untouched. George Lockwood's swarming soundtrack is likewise composed of conflicting languages, an elaborate work of plunderphonics in which snippets of sound stolen from movies collide with electronic soundscapes, contemporary chamber music, improv, and what not.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/btgZdrxvApQzD0kpLQB9kph9y0b.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [132171, 115022, 191383, 93507], "youtube_key": "LxJWwfZs6KM"}
