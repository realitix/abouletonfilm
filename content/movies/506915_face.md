The sound is the voice of continuous laughing of a woman repeated from a loop-tape. What I try to realize in this film is the question of gender through the facial expression in sex between woman and tranvestized man, and the image in detail between the ac ting and the real life. When these factors are mixed, one can hardly distinguish one from the other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3SoUMWtG4eHfB4jTqSeFiLnUJHv.jpg", "actors": ["Mario Montez ()", "Donna Kerness ()", "Linda ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
