Combining documentary techniques with straight dramatic narrative, the film focuses on a sergeant in the army of the Czar who loses track of his lovely wife. By the time he's discovered that his bride has re-married to an aristocrat, the sergeant has experienced a political epiphany, disdaining Imperialism in favor of the burgeoning Bolshevist movement.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wBVzQbHu1SeA56VWfR2aHzpG8Jc.jpg", "actors": ["Fyodor Nikitin (Filimonov)", "Lyudmila Semyonova (Filimonov's wife)", "Valeri Solovtsov (Filimonov's wife's new husband)", "Emil Gal (Passenger in the train)", "Yakov Gudkin (The wounded soldier)", "Sergei Gerasimov ()", "Vyacheslav Viskovsky ()", "Ursula Krug ()", "Aleksandr Melnikov ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
