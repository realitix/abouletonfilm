In an Old-Time Music ballad, the house sings of its life and the creatures it has sheltered during its lifetime journey from tree, to timber, to home, to an ultimate return to nature. It contemplates time, environmental change, and the rise of the seas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5zqnn9lwcsrI7LHG7rjg2pxg7PK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
