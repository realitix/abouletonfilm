It was the quartet's first performance together in over 24 years \u2014 the band's last show with Waters was at Earls Court in London on 17 June 1981.  Gilmour announced the Live 8 reunion on 12 June 2005:\r \u201c \tLike most people I want to do everything I can to persuade the G8 leaders to make huge commitments to the relief of poverty and increased aid to the third world. It's crazy that America gives such a paltry percentage of its GNP to the starving nations. Any squabbles Roger and the band have had in the past are so petty in this context, and if re-forming for this concert will help focus attention then it's got to be worthwhile. \t\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qi02YhIN98FR0w1kZn0ATUVZ9mZ.jpg", "actors": ["Roger Waters (Himself)", "David Gilmour (Himself)", "Nick Mason (Himself)", "Richard Wright (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
