Jean-Pierre Ponnelle\u2019s landmark production of Mozart\u2019s most human comedy provides the perfect setting for this superb cast under James Levine\u2019s ebullient leadership. The philandering and arrogant Count Almaviva (Thomas Allen) is no match for his wily servant Figaro (Ruggero Raimondi), whose soon-to-be-wife Susanna (Kathleen Battle) is as manipulative as she is charming. Add in one beautiful, disillusioned Countess (Carol Vaness) and one irrepressible, testosterone-laden teenage boy (Cherubino, played by Federica von Stade), and it\u2019s no wonder some critics say this is the perfect opera.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oXUA65gUlNaoGiFt1FzI8PjoLVG.jpg", "actors": ["Carol Vaness ()", "Kathleen Battle ()", "Ruggero Raimondi ()", "Thomas Allen ()", "Frederica von Stade ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
