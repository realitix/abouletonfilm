Women with children who want to divorce their husbands are not allowed to do so, all political parties have been outlawed, smoking is illegal and everyone must work. After a spat with her boyfriend, Carole (Laure Marsac) hails a taxi, not realizing that she has done so without any of the money or identification papers she needs. Her driver (Bruno Cremer) attempts to help her, but a variety of mishaps bring her to the attention of the police, who proceed to arrest her on made-up charges and a phoney HIV-positive result on tests given at the time of arrest.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zgBHOk6KKVbuxEJJjr5Sh9SLEQc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
