He accepts well his change of job, but when he meets his co-workers, uncultured and rough people, he starts having second thoughts. However, he takes it easy, recognizes that they're highly trained works, and teaches them a number of (flashback) stories of pioneers of the present steam train: the early invention by Denis Papin (1679); the three legendary land-surveyors of Caton Hill; the 1769 experiment by Nicolas-Joseph De Cugnot; the 1813 machine test of William Hedley; the 1829 developments by Robert Stephenson; and finally the grand opening of the first German steam railway line of N\u00fcrnberg-F\u00fcrth - stories in which man's will to conquer the machine was sometimes met with disaster.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wu3Au3JliRHflXbf3UglMWBdb5u.jpg", "actors": ["Aribert Mog (Narrator / Engineer Klaassen)", "Sophia Hagen (Various roles)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
