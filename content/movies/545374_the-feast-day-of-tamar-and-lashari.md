The ritual of Tamar and Lashari celebrates queen Tamar (12-13th century) and her son Lasha, deified by the mountain dwellers.  Each year, and for three days, on the hillside of a Caucasus valley, pilgrims consecutively meet at two sanctuaries consecrated to these deities and worship them through prayers, songs and sacrifices, enjoying at the same time food and happy chats with friends they have not seen for a year. In addition to prayers and sacrifices by a shrine priest, religious songs are an essential part of the ritual.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ceJ944OB47GS1u9LdSVbghs43V.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
