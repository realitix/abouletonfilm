A new group of recruits arrives at the Ranger station, among them, Tex Wyatt (Dave O'Brien), the son of Ranger Captain John Wyatt (Forrest Taylor), whom he hasn't seen for many years. Captain Wyatt tells Tex that, in the Rangers, he is there strictly on his own merit and there will be no favors played. He assigns Tex to pick up Dawson's trail, but orders that no arrest be made without proof.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wAsFDSRChTUTVgmO18XytNLCK02.jpg", "actors": ["Dave O'Brien (Texas Ranger Tex Wyatt (as Dave 'Tex' O'Brien))", "James Newill (Texas Ranger Jim Steele (as Jim Newill))", "Guy Wilkerson (Panhandle Perkins)", "Iris Meredith (Jean Lorin)", "Forrest Taylor (Captain John Wyatt)", "I.
