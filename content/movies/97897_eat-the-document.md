It was shot under Dylan's direction by D. A. Pennebaker, whose groundbreaking documentary Dont Look Back chronicled Dylan's 1965 British tour. The film was originally commissioned for the ABC television series Stage '66. Though shooting had completed for the film, Dylan's July 1966 motorcycle accident delayed the editing process. Once well enough to work again, Dylan edited the film himself. ABC rejected the film as incomprehensible for a mainstream audience.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bvRZhUAU8r9mtGJOvmW5TH4l9UI.jpg", "actors": ["Bob Dylan ()", "John Lennon ()", "Robbie Robertson ()", "Richard Manuel ()", "Rick Danko ()", "Garth Hudson ()", "Johnny Cash ()", "Albert Grossman ()", "Bob Neuwirth ()", "Mickey Jones ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
