He falls in love with a struggling actress, whose life is likewise wretched. Fairly unrelenting grim view of urban unemployment, with the usual dose of Balachander moralizing. An interesting study of the perception of government.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cyl1ympmZ7mEuAHgBELwqHdCEuV.jpg", "actors": ["Kamal Haasan (Rakesh Kumar Shastri)", "Anita Raj (Kusum)", "Nilu Phule (Jaggu - Kusum's father)", "Arjun Chakraborty (Tilak)", "Mazhar Khan (Pratap)", "Shreeram Lagoo (Mr. Shastri - Rakesh's father)", "Karan Razdan (Amit)", "Sulochana Latkar (Mrs. Shastri - Rakesh's mother)", "Arun Bakshi (Arun)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
