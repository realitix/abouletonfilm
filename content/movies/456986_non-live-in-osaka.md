If you weren\u2019t old enough -- or simply not in Japan at the time -- this performance is a must-see for those wishing to get a taste of Satanism (for once) represented proudly and productively on a music stage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hLJhqX0rkklIVifWbpEv5eHQhmy.jpg", "actors": ["Boyd Rice (Himself)", "Douglas P.
