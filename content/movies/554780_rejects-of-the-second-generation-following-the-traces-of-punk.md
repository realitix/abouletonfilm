But every end is a new beginning. After 1991 rose a new, second generation of punks who still believe that another world is possible and necessary. Active members of the underground: musicians, activists, squatters, music promoters and organizers tell us about punk ideology, culture, music, squatting movement, lust for freedom and political struggle under the flag of anarchism. Firsthand, forthright. This is a document of independence, love for music and creativity. Reflection on the work of passion and of the world, not driven by capital. From the punks for the punks.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vGzX2DlLm79zEPSHN5VbPKzUi47.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
