Featured songs include longtime bootleg favorite \"This Hard Land\" and the brand-new songs \"Secret Garden\" and \"Blood Brothers,\" as well as other previously unreleased tracks. The show aired originally on the Disney Channel. The documentary provides a thrilling behind-the-scenes look at Springsteen's creative process, which is famous for its attention to detail. Springsteen also constantly flips around music and lyrics among different songs until he nails it perfectly. The closeness of the band is evident at the outset in its ability to gel with Springsteen right off the bat even though they hadn't played together regularly since the late 1980s.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bHATwslsh1Liq4Yw9cWT9fiZc7T.jpg", "actors": ["Bruce Springsteen (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
