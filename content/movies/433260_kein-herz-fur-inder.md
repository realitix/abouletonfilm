The host parents Martin Brambach and Aglaia Szyszkowitz see this as a chance to finally win a girlfriend for their idiosyncratic 16-year-old daughter. But at the airport is not the expected \"hip\" Sandy McCartney from London in front of them, but a 13-year-old Indian boy! You want to get rid of the little Hindu as soon as possible. In a roundabout way, Zayn Baig in the role of the unwanted guest and Lena Urzendowsky as a loner are still pretty good friends.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pjJNwNmTZ2GSVu64BSaKkoU7DFz.jpg", "actors": ["Zayn Baig (Sandy Sacchidananda Char)", "Lena Urzendowsky (Fiona)", "Aglaia Szyszkowitz (Charlotte)", "Martin Brambach (Erik)", "Nicole Mercedes M\u00fcller (Annika)", "Anna Stieblich (Frau Silber)", "Andr\u00e9 Szymanski (Humboldt)", "Tristan G\u00f6bel (Benedikt)", "Neil Malik Abdullah (Mr. Char)", "Mala Ghedia (Mrs. Char)", "Ulrike R\u00f6seberg (Polizistin)", "Eva-Maria Kurz (Nachbarin)", "Michael Schunder (Rezeptionist)", "Hendrik Martz (Herr Viereck)", "Gerhard Wittmann (Adam Koelbrink)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [434106, 333373, 334224, 432656], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
