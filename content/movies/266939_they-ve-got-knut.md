While Ingo and Nadja have an open relationship, he thinks its time that they commit to one another exclusively, and is hoping this weekend will convince her this is a good idea. However, their privacy is interrupted when several guests arrive -- friends of Nadja's brother Knut (Ingo Haeb), a noted political activist, who, unbeknownst to her, has also planned a ski weekend. As the guests await Knut's arrival, they get the unpleasant news that he's been arrested during a demonstration; several propose that they should come to his aid, while the majority decide instead to go skiing as a way to pay tribute to his commitment to the cause.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hhz62zJuJWE6wlgKKBbAv9usEAz.jpg", "actors": ["Valerie Koch (Nadja)", "Hans-Jochen Wagner (Ingo)", "Pit Bukowski (Niklas)", "Alexandra Neldel (Sylvia)", "Ingo Haeb (Knut)", "Stephan Luca (Rolf)", "Jimi Lee King (Lars)", "Daniel Nocke (Wolfgang)", "Anneke Kim Sarnau (Jan)", "Rainer Strecker (Michael)", "Nina Weniger (Petra)", "Marc Zwinz (Jens)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
