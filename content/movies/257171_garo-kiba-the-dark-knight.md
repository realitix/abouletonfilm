Though he called himself a Makai Knight, Kiba was no different to a Horror. Kiba's spirit resides inside what was once a grey colored Makai Armor that's filled with the dark knowledge of Makai Power. As Barago absorbed Horror after Horror, Kiba eventually deformed into an organically pure black armor with a cape. Kiba assumed full control over his host upon Meisha's defeat by Kouga.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Agsn0T2VIVgyz4B4k6cwne3KnsH.jpg", "actors": ["Masaki Ky\u00f4moto (Karune Ryuzaki)", "Mika Hijii (Kaoru / Messiah)", "Leah Dizon (Makai Guide Eruda)", "Mikoto Inoue (Barago's Mother)", "Raima Hiramatsu (Young Barago)", "Kazuhiko Inoue (Bado (voice))", "Mizuho Yoshida (Barago Image)", "Asami (Messiah Image)", "Shin'ya Iida (Knight (voice))", "Kokoro Tanaka (Knight (voice))"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "stevzhe", "content": "KIBA: Ankoku Kishi Gaiden is a spin-off V-Cinema of the GARO television series, set for release on Blu-ray and DVD on September 7, 2011.
