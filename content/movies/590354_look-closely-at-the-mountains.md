Mining activities were destroying the environment in the state of Minas Gerais in the south west of the country. Through editing, Ana Vaz draws parallels between this region and the very distant Nord-Pas-de-Calais in northern France, also marked by over three centuries of mining. On one side, eroded mountains plague its inhabitants with deadly landslides. Hollow and gutted, these mountains become the receptacles of a ghostly memory. On the other side, in France, mining waste stacks become mountains and reservoirs of biodiversity, where the frontier between nature and technology is now indiscernible.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xKtdBbi7qQXlX9wzMmyeOP5QboS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
