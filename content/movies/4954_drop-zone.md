Pete's bosses believed that all the hijackers died when his brother shot one of the hijackers that caused an explosion.\r\n\r\nPete remains unconvinced that they died and does his own digging. He meets Jessie Crossman (Yancy Butler) a female parachutist and finds clues by hanging about other parachutists.\r\n\r\nThe film is has a nice balance of humour and violence with appealing leads but some of the action scenes could had been better, in fact some of it looked cheap."}], "recommandations_id": [10538, 9057, 11398, 11517]}
