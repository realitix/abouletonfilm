In search of a way out, the guerrillas ask an old friend (a missionary they had held hostage and released some 20 years ago) for the number of a humanitarian priest in hopes of finding someone to bring food to the mountain. The missionary mistakes the priests' name for the head paramilitary leader and inadvertently gives the guerrilla commanders the wrong number. Through a humorous confusion two sworn enemies end up face to face in an emotional encounter that unveils the very core of Colombia's conflict and the journey each one must take to finally find peace in a lifetime of war.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/icP5beShC4Cw48RFixAuCBPgvn7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "2F4578aTSi0"}
