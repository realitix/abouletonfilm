As the name suggests, the movie is actually in sense of the Buddha\u2019s theory.

So I try to translate in English hoping those who are not familiar with Chinese can enjoy the true spirit in the movie. The story is about how the odd-demon create his \u201cmutilation-poison leg\u201d. At the same time his disciple Dragon Girl realized his cruel means to all men including herself. Despairing Dragon Girl finally met her bosom friend Yuan Tung and her benefactor Long & Qiu and pull together to wipe out her evil master.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c1iLeFUGY8U9a1vhNUkM24RBhrv.jpg", "actors": ["Connie Chan Po-Chu ()", "Cheung Sang ()", "Walter Tso Tat-Wah ()", "Chi Chou ()", "Ho Siu-Hung ()", "Kwan Hoi-San ()", "Ling Mung ()", "Ng Yan-Chi ()", "Sek Kin ()", "Josephine Siao ()", "Yeung Yip-Wang ()", "Yu So-Chau ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
