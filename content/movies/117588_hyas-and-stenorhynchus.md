To blend in, both cover themselves with found objects, such as algae and sponges. We watch them move, eat, greet each other, and fight. They have small mandibles and large claws. Near them are spirograph worms, 6 inches long, with a plume of branchiae that fan out like exploding fireworks. We see vibrating cilia, 0.001 mm long, on the branchiae, sending food toward the mouth at the plume's center. Chopin's music and an off-screen narrator suggest we're watching a ballet.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g82OB3bgdLHsZJAWwE4dK8b9bLk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [190309, 236063, 176298, 175457], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
