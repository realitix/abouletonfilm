The documentary explores the confluence of science and spirituality in the first psychedelic research studies since the 1970s with terminally ill patients. As a society we devote a great deal of attention to treating cancer, but very little to treating the human being who is dying of cancer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qLQiSAW8crjzxyN97XOimIre2gb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
