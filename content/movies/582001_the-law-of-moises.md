Similar to his namesake -Moses 2,000 years earlier- our hero, Moises suffers from a speech impediment and anger issues. The similarities don't stop there - in the town, there seems to be BLOOD flowing in the Mississippi River. Other plagues follow, including frogs and locusts that aim to devour the town's historic landmarks.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oB42Ys2ymkQDed0pxzeF62Ue0WX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
