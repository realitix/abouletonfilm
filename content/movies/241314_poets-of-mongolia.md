It introduces a string of characters, each connected by a small happenstance, and each having their own desires and own stories to share with the audience. Through this process, the makers manage to engrave a beautiful ode to the Mongols\u2019 love for their fatherland and their will to persevere and fight it out, their tenacity to accept the harsh as destiny and not lose the fire to live with pride and esteem. A phase where people lost jobs and families starved, the will of the Mongols and their incessant commitment to art and music and nature really stands out. Poetry and music are both beautifully used to bring out the Mongolian culture, the Mongolian aspirations and the Mongolian connection. It also contains one of the best lines I have heard recently: \u201cYou go to your homeland not for for family or friends, but to replenish yourself. To find strength again for the future.\u201d Great trilogy, paints a comprehensive and blazing picture of Mongolia."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
