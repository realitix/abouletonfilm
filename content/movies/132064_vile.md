They are each outfitted with new accouterments--electronic devices attached to the base of their skulls--and a recording on a television screen alerts them of their task. In order to escape, they must hurt themselves and each other. The chemicals that the brain produces when in pain are collected by the devices, and when it collects a predetermined amount, the doors will be opened. Fail to do it in time, and everybody dies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w8TlkQEZkSAHwxTdPwsK2LYQqiv.jpg", "actors": ["Eric Jay Beck (Nick)", "April Matson (Tayler)", "Akeem Smith (Tony)", "Greg Cipes (Sam)", "Elisha Skorman (Kai)", "Heidi Mueller (Lisa)", "Maya Hazen (Tara)", "Rob Kirkland (Greg)", "McKenzie Westmore (Diane)", "Ian Bohen (Julian)", "Kieron Elliott (Thomas)", "Artie Baxter (Brent)", "Maynard James Keenan (Special Agent Ford)", "Stefanie Barboza (Kelly)", "Maria Olsen (Woman on TV)", "Mark Hengst (Chuck)", "Ceilidh Lamont (Surgeon)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [92395, 174678, 227877, 14021], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
