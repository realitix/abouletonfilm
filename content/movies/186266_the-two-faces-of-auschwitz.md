This is the incredible story of two albums filled with photographs taken at Auschwitz-Birkenau in May 1944. One was recovered in 2007 from an SS officer and contains photographs depicting moments of leisure enjoyed by officers responsible for the camp, while the other shows the arrival of Hungarian Jews a few hours before most of them would be executed. When Auschwitz is liberated, a young Jewish girl discovers this latter album and finds that it contains images of her now-deceased family members.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vdPsp6QGe0pk6vxw1CgVBpCdV8A.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
