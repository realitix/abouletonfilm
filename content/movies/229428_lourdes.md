When the Virgin Mary appears to her in a cavern near Lourdes, no one takes the girl seriously, even when she digs up a wellspring at the Virgin's instructions The local authorities even try to hush up the entire incident. In vain, however, because when Empress Eug\u00e9nie requests water from the spring for her sickly son, they are forced to acquiesce. And even the local priest is finally convinced. While taking his tuberculosis-stricken fianc\u00e9 Claire to a sanatorium, the young doctor Henri Guillaumet meets Bernadette. The water from Lourdes' spring heals Claire's disease overnight, but the scientist in Henri doubts the miracle and wants to expose Bernadette as a liar. It is not until Henri again meets Bernadette, who has in the meantime become a nun and works as a nurse, that he finds a way to balance belief and modern science. And his love for Claire is strengthened as well.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4vnhsQwCqu0vtZX1THo0xsCmj2u.jpg", "actors": ["Alessandro Gassman (Bernard / Henri Guillaumet)", "Ang\u00e8le Osinsky (Bernadette Soubirous)", "Florence Darel (Claire La Fontaine)", "Roger Souza (Fran\u00e7ois Soubirous)", "Sydne Rome (Mutter Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se)", "G\u00fcnther Maria Halmer (Kaplan Peyramale)", "Helmut Griem (Auguste La Fontaine)", "Umberto Orsini (Pater Laurent)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
