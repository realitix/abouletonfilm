Privately she finds her luck alongside the famous artist Max Kruse, but the wild marriage is considered scandalous and has a negative effect on the sale of his art. Thus, K\u00e4the moves without him into an artists' colony on Monte Verit\u00e0 on Lake Maggiore. Out of necessity, she creates a doll that has never been seen before: with a natural expression and vivid facial expressions. What follows is a blitz career. But the phenomenal success of their handmade dolls causes unpleasant imitations - their company is about to go out.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o9RFmVmxxeD6WZ0wyAQ912sLrHf.jpg", "actors": ["Friederike Becht (K\u00e4the Kruse)", "Franz Dinda (David)", "Wilfried Hochholdinger (Ferdinand Bing)", "Fritz Karl (Max Kruse)", "Ursula Strauss (Mutter)", "Rainer Bock ()", "Carl Achleitner (Vertreter)", "Godehard Giese (Robert Rogaske)", "Paul Matic (Leo Schmaus)", "Henning Peker (Reporter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "4pXEhAbwalU"}
