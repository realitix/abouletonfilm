The old conjure woman Mandy returns with her daughter Chloe to their bayou home after fifteen years. Chloe was too young to remember much about the bayou, but once Mandy had been a famous voodoo priestess in these parts. But after the whites lynched her husband Sam, she took her little girl &amp; moved away into the Everglades. She seems to have gone a little mad in the intervening years &amp; has returned swearing a belated vengeance against the murdering white folks.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cVzsYN6SSWIvOPlexL42wn1KwzP.jpg", "actors": ["Olive Borden (Chloe)", "Reed Howes (Wade Carson)", "Molly O'Day (Joyce, the Colonel's niece)", "Philip Ober (Jim)", "Georgette Harvey (Old Mandy)", "Francis Joyner (Col.
