Quick-witted and smart-mouthed, he is entrusted by his father Fauzan to manage and care for Malacca\u2019s Water Theme Park for a short while as he has matters to attend to. However, Ajiboy\u2019s abilities are doubted by Cumi and Mat Saja, the park\u2019s supervisors who love to take advantage of their positions by giving freebies away to women. When Ajiboy finds out, he decides to punish the two by demoting them to menial cleaning tasks, which prompts them to commit a betrayal. As if he does not have his hands full already, Ajiboy has to find a wife for his father in order to fulfil his deceased mother\u2019s wishes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8Y6U5vSbz5qxnjguBRYyL2uRnX8.jpg", "actors": ["Zalif Sidek (Mat Saja)", "Epy Kodiang (Chumi)", "Angah Raja Lawak (Encik Fauzan)", "Fyza Kadir (Mama Ajiboy)", "Rykal Iskandar (Ajiboy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "SGe8kGvozs0"}
