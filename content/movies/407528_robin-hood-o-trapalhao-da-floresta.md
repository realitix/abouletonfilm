He wanted to take the lands of his deceased brother and leave his niece Catherine with nothing. During a showdown, Robin Hood is injured and needs to be replaced at the helm of the group. And then the funny confusions begin! As a substitute is chosen Z\u00e9 Grilo, a modest and at the same time confused pawn, who in the end manages to unmask Climero and save the beautiful Catherine for which he has a passion. In this mission it is aided by the companion Willie and also by a magic wand and a protective pen, provided by an Indian sorcerer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kPH0ZO12dNVn05mhW8eW33qOK0a.jpg", "actors": ["Renato Arag\u00e3o (Z\u00e9 Grilo)", "Ded\u00e9 Santana (William)", "M\u00e1rio Cardoso (Robin Hood)", "Monique Lafond (Catarina)", "Carvalhinho (Frade)", "Jorge Cherques (Coronel Jo\u00e3o Clim\u00e9rio dos Reis)", "Francisco Dantas (Tabeli\u00e3o)", "Cosme dos Santos (Jo\u00e3ozinho Barra-limpa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
