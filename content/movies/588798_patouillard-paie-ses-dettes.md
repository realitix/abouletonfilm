In vain he tries his wily arts and blandishments upon them. It is quite evident that he will either have to go to America and there get married or go to work. Bill sallies forth in search of employment or a rich widow, not particularly which in his despair, and chances upon a stray bear. Bruin decides to go into partnership with William and they soon scare away all the creditors. The way Bruin handles the creditors causes much wholesome fun and cannot fail to appeal to young and old.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Paul Bertho (Patouillard)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
