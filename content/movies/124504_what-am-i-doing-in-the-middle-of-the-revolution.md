Whereas the latter coninues his revolutionary fight, Guidi and Albino start an odyssey through the struggling Mexico, which lets them fall one time in the hands of Carasco the other time in those of Herrera or even in the clutches of \u201chand-taking\u201d bandidos.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j5hSKGInXjLLwlUovpSJRPyfGNx.jpg", "actors": ["Vittorio Gassman (Guido Guidi)", "Paolo Villaggio (Don Albino Moncalieri)", "Eduardo Fajardo (Pablo Carrasco)", "Riccardo Garrone (Peppino Garibaldi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
