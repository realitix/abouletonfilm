Nevertheless, while its aim is clear, the message is vague and up to interpretation. Wherever it casts its eye, Faroughi\u2019s camera tries to register this somehow cynical dichotomy. It begins in a theater house in the old city of Isfahan that has staged Shakespeare\u2019s Othello. There is no attentive audience and the players are detached and exhausted. A young man from amongst the audience begins a long journey into the web of narrow alleys of Isfahan and ends up in the main mosque of the city where he meets a young girl. Despite the initial chaotic situations, from its halfway point, the film begins to render a silent observation of a night that will end at the break of dawn.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sEosQrpZARhkBYtfPE1ei80kWHr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "jBGdLL5e18I"}
