But you should then know that you get no deeper look into the character and where she comes from or anything so don't fall into that 'trap' cause it truly and literally is not even half as good as 'The Woman (2011)' so you're not missing out on anything.\r\n\r\nIf it wasn't for some shock value scenes and the extremely loud chime bell sounds that randomly shows up chances are I'd fallen asleep watching it, avoid."}], "recommandations_id": [206721, 48616, 259246, 408149], "youtube_key": "Yxy3K2ewJoU"}
