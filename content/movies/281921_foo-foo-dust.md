As they navigate their respective addictions, each comes close to overdosing just before they're evicted from their apartment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jMLtEFhRuK1OwYaJ1F3eBWn2EvN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "iViNMhBciqg"}
