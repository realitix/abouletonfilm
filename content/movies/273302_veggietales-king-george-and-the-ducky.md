But George isn't satisfied with just his rubber ducky - he wants all the duckies! The king learns a lesson in humility from his brave soldier Thomas, whose ducky George had stolen. Eventually, George faces his sin and learns that it's always important to share with others.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6rAxkV5qNfiro1zostu11Pq9qb7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [273318, 273296, 273127, 273315], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
