In 1999, they met in Cuba, a country that seemed to mirror many of their questions, hopes and fears. The film looks at their real lives and different roads to exile; two utopian visions sought under very different conditions on separate continents. It is a double portrait of two extraordinary women that succeeds in avoiding the twin pitfalls of condemnation and glorification.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/49zflgOXqFBBuL90jFsHiv78CIg.jpg", "actors": ["Mar\u00eda Barhoum (Herself)", "Inge Viett (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
