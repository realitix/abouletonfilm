Her friend impressionist Childe Hassam prepared illustrations for Celia's last book, An Island Garden, published in 1894 just before her death. Based on her book, the unique garden has been recreated on Appledore Island and now attracts hundreds of visitors annually. This film tells the story of Celia and her garden, her friendship with Hassam and other artists, and the effort made by Shoals Marine Laboratory founder Dr. John Kingsbury to recreate the garden 80 years after Thaxter's death.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
