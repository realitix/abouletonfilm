She wanders life like a ghost, articulating her suffering perspectives in repetitive thoughts and journals. Everything changes when she decides to write a romance fantasy for the way she wished things would go, including an alter ego named Rie meeting a man named Fuyuki in love at first sight. Her debut novel \"Soft Cream Love\" is a huge hit, and Eri is catapulted to wealth and circles of admirers. Shy, she blows her chance to meet a cute guy and instead makes a pass at her clumsy unattractive agent named Hoshino, who walks away with his cynical attitudes born of romantic disappointment. When she pursues him into the street, she by chance meets a nice guy just as she hoped, but he never shows up at their first date because, unknown to her, he's hit by a car.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9TOwPm1nb2MdEm4Fv4PB1fVs1ZF.jpg", "actors": ["Sayuri Oyamada (Eri Manaka)", "Yuichi Kishino (Hoshino)", "Makoto Ogi (Rie)", "Machu Mansyu (Maruyama)", "Yoji Tanaka (Fuyuki Tohjoh)", "Katsu Kanai (God (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
