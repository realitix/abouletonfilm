Ten stories of ten protagonists (from 20-45 years old) who live in a metropolis, not necessarily identifiable, in search of the meaning of their own existence. A bitter comedy that combines comic and paradoxical elements with the cruelty of everyday life. A whirl of encounters, sex, illness, drugs, loneliness and pain.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vydgbtoqzmCcJQyB907UsYrP8FT.jpg", "actors": ["Anna Galiena (Sara)", "Dar\u00edo Grandinetti (Marcelo)", "Francesca Faiella (Beatrice)", "Danilo Nigrelli (Giovanni)", "Marco Foschi (Paolo)", "Roberto Bocchi (Medico)", "Lorenzo De Angelis (Ricky)", "Carmen Giardina (Lori)", "Jamil Hammoudi (Bed)", "Carolina Salvati (Sonia)", "Jun Ichikawa (Elena)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
