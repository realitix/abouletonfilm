Using the work of the mysterious twentieth century French Alchemist, Fulcanelli, as his foundation, and his discovery of a three hundred fifty year old Alchemical Cross in the South of France, Jay Weidner describes the experiences, insights and powerful evidence that opens the door to a new view of the intimate relationship between myth, history, science and the true destiny of humanity. In doing so, he reveals the ultimate meaning underlying the resurrection of Christ, the message of the Book of the Revelations, the vision of Ezekiel and the Kabbalistic concept of the \"Restoration of the World.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/63p15WcTX0RrJ08027gtbrHX9el.jpg", "actors": ["Jay Weidner (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "mqTGD_B1lhg"}
