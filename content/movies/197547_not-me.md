It began when he was a sensitive 11-year old awakened in the night by the sound of his parents making love. Not understanding the nature of the groans, he peeks in and is horrified by the sight. Things get worse the next day when he and his mother discover that daddy died in his sleep that night. The boy, confused by it all deduces that it was the sex-act that killed his father and so refuses to mature so he will never have to die. This goes on several years and for some reason his mother doesn't seem to mind. Things seem okay until his mom's new boy friend moves in. The teen and the lover constantly fight. Late at night, the boy begins spying on his mother and the man and in so doing comes to realize that sex is not as deadly as it seemed. Once this light dawns, the boy is able to grow up and become normal.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zd7lZyXTjm39VQq2CoXHUTesHM2.jpg", "actors": ["Louise Portal ()", "Isabelle Pasco ()", "Richard Moffatt ()", "Patrice Godin ()", "Daniel Gadouas ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
