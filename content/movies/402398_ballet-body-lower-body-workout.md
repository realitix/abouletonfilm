Lose inches while building lean muscles with movements inspired by ballet, dance, Pilates, and yoga. Ballet BodyT by Leah Sarago integrates traditional body-weight resistance exercises with muscle-elongating techniques to achieve a long and lean physique. Suitable for all fitness levels, these workouts draw on isometrics, the stretch-reflex principle, and muscle-contraction training for optimal results. Get the dancer's legs you've always wanted with this calorie-torching barre workout. The muscle-toning moves lengthen the thighs, lift the backside, and sculpt the backs of the legs for sleek definition and a slim figure. After the workout, relax into a 13-minute yoga- and dance-centered stretch.
