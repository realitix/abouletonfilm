One side feeds populism and religious rectitude in a monochromatic landscape, painted white, lamenting for a past that never will return. The other side fuels diversity and multiculturalism, a biased vision of a progressive future, quite unlikely. Both sides are constantly confronted, without listening to each other. Only a few reasonable people gather to change this potentially dangerous situation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/roA7HyWCdCSsquSOSpApDRGehP3.jpg", "actors": ["David Cay Johnston (Himself - Journalist)", "Thomas Frank (Himself - Journalist)", "Paula Green (Herself - Peace Activist)", "Mark Lilla (Himself - Historian)", "Molly Crabapple (Herself - Artist)", "Brit Bennett (Herself - Writer)", "Jeremy Peters (Himself - Journalist)", "Fred Harper (Himself - Artist)", "Danna Singer (Herself - Photographer)", "David Boaz (Himself - CATO Institute)", "Chris Bedford (Himself - Museum Director)", "Stephen Towns (Himself - Artist)", "Jeff Chapman-Crane (Himself - Artist)", "Gwen Johnson (Herself)", "Donald Trump (Himself (archive footage))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
