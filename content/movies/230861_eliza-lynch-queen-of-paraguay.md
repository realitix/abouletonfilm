Irish-born Eliza Lynch, lifetime partner of dictator Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez, was painted by Brazil as a puppet master, thief and whore, and in 1991 included alongside Lucretia Borgia and Catherine the Great in a book entitled The World\u2019s Wickedest Women. In Paraguay, the country where she lived as a beloved uncrowned queen, she is a national heroine. Fascinated by the contradiction, Irish academics Michael Lillis and Ronan Fanning embarked on 18 years of research to write a biography which forms the basis of Alan Gilsenan\u2019s unique and compassionate documentary. Blending interviews with re-enactments of Eliza\u2019s life \u2013 wonderfully performed by actress Maria Doyle \u2013 Gilsenan thoughtfully breathes humanity into a portrait of a much maligned woman.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bIthG3KrS4mPcMbs7qRGpsKLLtA.jpg", "actors": ["Maria Doyle Kennedy ()", "Leryn Franco ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "v3E8hClrSAg"}
