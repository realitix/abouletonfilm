The band was an offspring from the separation of Sentimiento Muerto, and was formed by Carlos \"Cayayo\" Troconis (voice and guitar), H\u00e9ctor Castillo (bass) and Sebasti\u00e1n Araujo (drums). The record is still considered by many as the most influential in the Venezuelan rock scene.  Twenty years later, Castillo and Araujo remember the stories behind the recording, as a group of the current generation of Venezuelan rockers, not only explain its influence and impact, but also play all the songs from the album, making them their own.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7iUX2mfmI8oBa3Z9G3ZWXyr8UUu.jpg", "actors": ["Hector Castillo (Himself)", "Sebastian Araujo (Himself)", "Cayayo Troconis (Himself (footage))", "Carlos Reyes (Himself)", "Rafael Cadavieco (Narrator)", "Rafael Cadavieco (Himself)", "Rodrigo Gonsalves (Himself)", "Reynaldo Goitia (Himself)", "Henry D'Arthena (Himself)", "Diego Garcia (Himself)", "Octavio Su\u00f1\u00e9 (Himself)", "P\u00e1vel Tello \"El Ruso\" (Himself)", "Luis Jimenez (Himself)", "Marianne Mal\u00ed (Herself)", "Fernando Rojas (Himself)", "Fernando Rojas (Himself)", "Fernando Rojas (Himself)", "Kuamasi Gonzalez (Himself)", "Mattia Medina (Himself)", "Gabriel Figueira (Himself)", "Alain G\u00f3mez (Himself)", "Luis Daniel Gonz\u00e1lez (Himself)", "Andres Blanco (Himself)", "Juan Manuel Fernandez (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "t6yUN0oG7zw"}
