Shigeru, an aspiring hobby painter, adores the seemingly unapproachable flutist Haruyo Kikuchi from afar, and secretly paints her portrait for a national contest. His friend Shinji has a crush on Hitomi, the daughter of the local grocery shop, who, for her part, likes Shigeru since he once cared for her in a critical situation, while they were kids. When Shigeru learns that his shy friend doesn't dare to talk to Hitomi, he decides to help him, asking Hitomi to go out with Shinji. But when Hitomi admits her love for him, Shigeru's youthful hormones are beginning to run wild, with a disastrous outcome.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2mJnoyJZ5vKnKjRttn3ZuPWTcNH.jpg", "actors": ["Tamotsu Ishibashi (Shigeru Yoshimura)", "Gen Kodama (Shinji Suzuki)", "Yoriko D\u00f4guchi (Hitomi Terajima)", "Tomoko Aizawa (Haruyo Kikuchi)", "Toshiko Yabuki (Hatsuko Suzuki)", "K\u00f4ju Ran (Etsuko)", "Kyoko Oguma (Taeko Yoshimura)", "Ben Hiura (Ryozo Yoshimura)", "Sansh\u00f4 Shinsui (Issei Gomura)", "Midori Hagio (Namiko Gomura)", "Masato Irie ()", "Tetsur\u014d Degawa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
