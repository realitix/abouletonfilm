From unexplained sightings and alien contact, to prophetic dreams, clairvoyance and astral projection, we explore the phenomena that has surrounded these \"experiencers\" from childhood to their adult years. This documentary explores the theories of who and what the \"visitors\" really are, and uncovers a plausible scenario for their intentions, as well as the government's involvement in suppressing this information from the public. Perhaps the greatest revelation is the shocking possibility that the alien visitor's greatest acquisition will be achieved, not from probing our bodies, but rather by invading our minds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/As7iwTcrkKcJqDSOV6E6dXMA0TA.jpg", "actors": ["Thomas Hamm (Narrator)", "Deborah Manacchio (Narrator)", "Frank E.
