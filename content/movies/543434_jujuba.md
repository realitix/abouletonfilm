Facing an unwelcome trip to his childhood home, he goes to light a cigarette. What he finds in his pocket, however, is a jujuba fruit. The shiny red skin brings back vague memories of his second mother, R\u00e8n Sh\u00ecr\u00f3ng. Born in the Sichuan province of China, jujuba fruits were her favorite snack.  At the time, he didn\u2019t want to call her \u201cMom,\u201d so at his father\u2019s suggestion, she became \u201cSis.\u201d As he thinks back on Sis, past and present meet, drawing us into a world neither dream nor reality.  \u2013\"People can never really understand each other.  Thinking back, I feel this way because of my former mother-in-law. That time, when Kansai dialect and Sichuan Chinese flew back and forth around me and I called my mother Sis, is recreated on expired 8 millimeter film. The expiration date of the film used is the same year that she walked out on us.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l2i77zq7kz7rZ6pOrSXueRsuLej.jpg", "actors": ["Shinya Ueno ()", "Geizen Shu ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
