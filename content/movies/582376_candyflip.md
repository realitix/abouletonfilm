Most of them go back once the season gets over. Few choose to stay back, digging deeper into the traces of a hippie hangover, or trying to search oneself through the incandescent, colorful, trippy shores of Goa. And a few yet, get in so deep at the wrong end of paradise, that they are lost forever, in the same place, but in a whole different world altogether. The film takes one such real-life character - Roy - through a plethora of happenings, phenomena, legends, myths, sights, sounds, experiences and thrilling stories of the fabled Goan paradise. What happens to the protagonist through the bitter-sweet, darkly funny, crazy, trippy journey and what comes along at the end of it, weaves the half-fictitious/half-real story of our film - CandyFlip.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/42t6PNrNXdiOUrxuSvATMOEQ852.jpg", "actors": ["Gulshan Devaiah ()", "Kristian Hedegaard-Petersen ()", "Kalki Koechlin ()", "Valeriya Polyanychko ()", "Prashant Prakash ()", "Prakash Raj ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "2JLYKwIEHSY"}
