These indigenous Indian women jump into the ring every Sunday in their traditional vibrant mulitlayered skirts and perform the acrobatic maneuvers of Lucha Libre (a blend of Mexican and American professional wrestling). The Fighting Cholitas documents this weekly fight and goes behind the scenes to find out who these women are and what draws them to this unusual sport.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7njDhgtePiMFfDfDM2OYIdwmUGJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "YFXSsoyLpLg"}
