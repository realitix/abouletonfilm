In this edition of Back to the Territories, join host Jim Cornette and his guest Hacksaw Jim Duggan as they undertake an in-depth analysis of Mid South Wrestling.  Mid South was the brainchild of legendary promoter Cowboy Bill Watts, a character as rich in lore as his territory. The stars that blossomed in Mid South would go on to captivate wrestling fans for years, long after their tenure with Watts had ended. The names Duggan, DiBiase, Reed, and Junkyard Dog were only a handful that can be traced back to the territory.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jim Cornette (Himself)", "James Edward Duggan Jr (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
