It featured three of the most well-known musical names in the country - John Farnham, Olivia Newton-John and Anthony Warlow. The three appear to get on very well together and play off each other to a great extent, especially during the finale when all are on stage at the same time. This is a huge presentation with a truck-load of songs taken from many genres and ranging in age from contemporary to carbon-dated.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/evex3r7HwpGGlgHv1ZgEI2cknAn.jpg", "actors": ["John Farnham (Himself)", "Olivia Newton-John (Herself)", "Anthony Warlow (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
