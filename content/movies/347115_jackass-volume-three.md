But in the meantime here's Volume 3. Volume three of the Jackass series contains a random, haggard selection of segments and bits that aired on our crappy little television show. Memorable moments in this half-ass collection include the recitation of the Gettysburg Address by Johnny Knoxville while a beard of leeches is applied to his ruggedly handsome face, Chris Pontius stripping down for the pleasure of five other dudes, Wee Man and Preston Lacy pulling a \"poo switcheroo\" with a porta-potty, Dave England digging through the trash and unearthing a tasty treat in a diaper, and a bunch of other absurd stunts, pranks and queer misbehavior from our bumbling cat and crew of idiots.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r4sorjyehs251Uz0AyBmdBv4UTy.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Knoxville (Himself)", "Steve-O (Himself)", "Bam Margera (Himself)", "Ryan Dunn (Himself)", "Brandon DiCamillo (Himself)", "Jason Acu\u00f1a (Himself)", "Dave England (Himself)", "Ehren McGhehey (Himself)", "Preston Lacy (Himself)", "Jeff Tremaine (Himself)", "Chris Pontius (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [347112, 347114, 265065, 253414], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
