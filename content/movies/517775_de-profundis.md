Incorporating home movies from the 1920's and early gay male erotica along with images from Radical Faerie gatherings, queer pagan rituals, drag performances and images of confinement, this 65 minute film sets up a haunting investigation of queerness, masculinity, history and sexuality. These images are buttressed against a soundtrack composed of Wilde's aphorisms, a voice and piano setting of Wilde's prison letter, and multi-tracked interviews with a diverse group of contemporary gay men.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qaHsa7AjF2DpqktEadjOkf0yCSa.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
