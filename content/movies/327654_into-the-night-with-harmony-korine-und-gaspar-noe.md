Thank God to whoever determined that Korine and Noe should hang out, because the results are pretty great. The pair spent the day goofing in Nashville, where they go a gun range, visit a junkyard, attend a screening of Korine's \"Trash Humpers,\" go have some chicken and talk about all manner of topics. Oh yeah, there's also a random cameo by David Berman of The Silver Jews.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tYIJbxllYizaIX75UUPZHcLHt5J.jpg", "actors": ["Gaspar No\u00e9 (Gaspar No\u00e9)", "Harmony Korine (Harmony Korine)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [113953], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
