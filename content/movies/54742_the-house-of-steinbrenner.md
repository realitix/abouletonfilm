Led by the Babe, the Iron Horse, the Yankee Clipper and the Mick, they dominated baseball for more than four decades before the legendary franchise sagged under the ownership of CBS. Then in 1973, a 42-year-old shipbuilder named George Steinbrenner, a man now as iconic to his team as the pinstripes on its uniforms, headed a group that purchased the Yankees, and turned that investment into a billion-dollar business. Since 1923, the \u2018House that Ruth Built\u2019 has been the epicenter of the baseball world, inspiring generations of fans to maintain loyalties through good times and bad. But with a deteriorating facility and an eye towards 21st century style revenues, Steinbrenner was inspired to build an impressive new stadium. While the Yankees kept their Bronx address at 161st and River Avenue, the new ballpark marked the end of one grand era with the hope of launching another.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hX4SIdue8NzSb8prEm5NJaBJpwg.jpg", "actors": ["Joe DiMaggio (himself)", "Rudolph Giuliani (himself)", "Lou Gehrig (himself)", "Larry King (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [54672, 54740, 54737, 54688], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
