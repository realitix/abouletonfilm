With the help of Lakota-Sioux and local butcher, Dallas Dupree, they harvest a Buffalo and show you the steps Native American\u2019s have taken to harvest, process and use almost every part of the animal. Learn how to skin the animal starting at the back, how to butcher it using both stone and steel tools, how to preserve the brain for brain-tanning at a later date, how to remove and prepare tendons for sinew, how to prepare the stomachs for use as a cooking vessel. Additionally learn how to make an expedient stone tool for skinning and butchering\u2026 and much, much more. This video shows graphic scenes. (You have probably seen more graphic scenes on many nature programs on TV.)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/MWbUPFmlknouXFax9G3ZpP6OUP.jpg", "actors": ["Ron Hood (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
