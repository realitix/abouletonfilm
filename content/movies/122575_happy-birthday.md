Working with the legacies of anthropological and observational non-fiction cinema, and in the avant-garde tradition of filmmakers like Warren Sonbert and Mark LaPore, Schwartz makes the camera a catalyst for a transformed dynamic between the figure behind the camera and those in front. Turning his camera on the people and places around him (whether in his New England home or on his travels abroad), Schwartz captures jewel-like fragments of gesture, light and colour that he then meticulously assembles alongside sounds collected as field recordings, creating films of great beauty and feeling that seem to vibrate with a total openness to the surrounding world and its denizens.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mSMcSjziJ6jRDmoNvdieJwvGbpa.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
