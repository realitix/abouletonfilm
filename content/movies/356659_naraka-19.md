Carol Lai (The Floating Landscape) directs this labored, but still intriguing effort, which stars one of those ever-popular Twins girls. Gillian Chung is the Twin du jour this time; Chung plays Rain, a perfect-complexioned princess who checks into a college dormitory suite along with pals Mandy (Bonnie Xin), Violet (new EEG starlet Vincy), and Eva (Maggie Li). The suite is your standard used-and-abused four-person room, except this place comes with bad karma: back in 1997, bohemian stud Gao Yuan (Jones Xu) offed himself in the same room, and the bad times are now coming home to roost. Not only is Gao Yuan seemingly wandering the halls of the school in 2007, but the quartet of girls seem to be following him to Hell, one-by-one.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gggJG8JQAmDXzT2TCVUwq8spWT5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
