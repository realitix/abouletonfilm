Five cups of coffee and two ashtrays are in front of him; he drinks and smokes. Steven joins him. They start a conversation about cigarettes and coffee. Steven likes to drink coffee before he sleeps, so he can dream faster. The conversation jumps around. \"You know my mother?\" asks Roberto. Steven describes coffee Popsicles. They switch seats; then switch back. Steven has to leave for a dental appointment he's not looking forward to. Roberto makes a startling offer, inspired no doubt by the coffee and cigarettes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3JMwfs5Z9LRBOC7TUgApDBGiuIr.jpg", "actors": ["Roberto Benigni (Roberto)", "Steven Wright (Steven)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [263912, 472693, 166669, 268265], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
