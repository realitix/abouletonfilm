Susan Sarandon narrates the simple story of a bunny readying for bed. Other top entertainers lend their voices to the tape: Tony Bennett sings the story of \"Hit the Road to Dreamland\"; Lauryn Hill brings rhythm to \"Hush, Little Baby\" (the best segment); Billy Crystal lends many voices to Mercer Mayer's \"There's a Nightmare in My Closet\"; and singers Natalie Cole, Aaron Neville, and Patti LeBelle sing other tales. A dandy video for the youngster, punctuated with \"interviews\" of real kids answering a host of bedtime questions. --Doug Thomas", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pOnxG7uJg11KdSCgWdtY0xAQKLC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
