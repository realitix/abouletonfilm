He seeks inspiration in various out of the way places. During this film viewers go with him to the Colisseum at night, on a subway ride past Roman ruins, to the Appian Way, to a slaughterhouse, and on a visit to Marcello Mastroianni's house. Fellini also is seen in his own office interviewing a series of unusual characters seeking work or his help.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/736Wck0ZX5r9qmH3jZZcCXTSMY0.jpg", "actors": ["Federico Fellini (Himself)", "Giulietta Masina (Herself)", "Marcello Mastroianni (Himself)", "Caterina Boratto (Herself)", "Marina Boratto (Herself)", "David Maumsell (Himself)", "Pasqualino De Santis (Himself)", "Nino Rota (Himself)", "Bernardino Zapponi (Himself)", "Alvaro Vitali (Himself)", "Cesarino Miceli Picardi (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [105347, 335202, 134193, 104089], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
