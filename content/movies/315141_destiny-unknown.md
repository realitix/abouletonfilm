In addition to facing poverty, deprivation, and prejudice, the immigrants are also bedeviled by a raging fever epidemic. Finally achieving a measure of prosperity, the Italians are forced to confront tragedy once more when their grown children march off to WWI. Though Isa Miranda is top-billed, she has very little to do in comparison with male lead Filippo Scelso. Passaporto Rosso was released in the U.S. as Destiny Unknown.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8OUtM470JCCdj6wA2rBtEvLHiWl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
