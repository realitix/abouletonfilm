When the suicide turns out to be murder, what she discovers disrupts the entire family and puts Cordelia's life in danger. This off-beat British film is a moody, entertaining thriller, much in the tradition of film noir, but with an unusual and determined female detective. Nicely directed by Christopher Petit, and based on the wonderful novel of the same name by the acclaimed British mystery writer P. J. James, this film gives a fresh approach to the detective-film genre and introduces an intelligent and resourceful woman to a profession usually dominated by men.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vWLAsfA1X4yoqAN0qOl6GhAMnhf.jpg", "actors": ["Billie Whitelaw ()", "Paul Freeman ()", "Pippa Guard ()", "Dominic Guard ()", "David Horovitch ()", "Elizabeth Spriggs (Miss Markland)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
