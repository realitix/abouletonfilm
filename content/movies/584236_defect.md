See a handful of world-class riders demonstrate the latest innovations in street, mountain and trials unicycling. Defect combines groundbreaking filmmaking with a fresh soundtrack and bonus rider commentary, to showcase the skills and personalities of this rapidly emerging sport.  Highly technical and highly entertaining, this video features some gee-whiz riding that will make you wince many times. Dan Heaton's skill as a filmmaker is as outrageous as his riding.  Released on DVD in 2005, Defect became the most popular full-length unicycle highlight film to date. Building on the street and trials riding featured in previous films (UNiVERsE - 2000, UNiVERsE 2 - 2004), it also introduced the beginnings of flat-land unicycling.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Dan Heaton ()", "Kris Holm ()", "Ryan Atkins ()", "Jeff Groves ()", "Xavier Collos ()", "Sabin Arditty ()", "Brian Lundgren ()", "Mike Clark ()", "Zack Baldwin ()", "Kaori Matsuzawa ()", "Kevin McMullin ()", "Shaun Johanneson ()", "Keaton Miller ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
