Sylvie Gagnon was attending her last day of classes at the University of Montreal's \u00c9cole Polytechnique, when Marc L\u00e9pine entered the building. Separating the women from the men, he opened fire on the women students, yelling 'You're all a bunch of feminists.' Sylvie survived, while fourteen other women were murdered. This video makes the connection between the massacre and male violence against women, setting the stage for an exploration of misogyny and sexism.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/SDTw6i8XA90CLDPP811wFVpHiL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
