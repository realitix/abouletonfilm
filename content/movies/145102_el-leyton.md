The braggart Modesto is a slave to progress, while the more unpretentious Leyton is content with the simple life. Modesto marries Marta, a beautiful young na\u00eff, who longs for the sexual fulfillment Modesto (who is \"like a rabbit - one jump up and one jump down\") is incapable of providing. And, just as Modesto captures creatures from the sea in his net, it isn't long before the cruel web of destiny entangles Marta and her lover Leyton in a tragic triangle. Chilean director Gonzalo Justiniano spins a tragic tale of love, lust, friendship, betrayal and murder.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nKTtJejVf11UnU6BRkOI4iGtjXE.jpg", "actors": ["Juan Pablo S\u00e1ez (Leyton)", "Siboney Lo (Marta)", "Luis Wigdorsky (Modesto)", "Gabriela Hern\u00e1ndez (Josefa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
