The meeting is essentially a party, and the entire company bumps and grinds with itself everywhere from in boardrooms to airplanes. K-Corea INC. K processes ideas of automation and containment, embodied by these hyper-controlled locations and by the seemingly looping actions that take place in them. Meetings, where discrete parts of a corporate body come together to attempt to \"get on the same page,\" display the futility of corporate unity, and of individual purpose or voice remaining intact within a corporate culture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3Z7iYyCDLESDIe2uHx9xhiFskMh.jpg", "actors": ["Telfar Clemens (Global Korea)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
