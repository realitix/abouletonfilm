I have known joys. That is saying too little: I am alive, and this life gives me the greatest pleasure. And what about death? When I die (perhaps any minute now), I will feel immense pleasure. I am not talking about the foretaste of death, which is stale and often disagreeable. Suffering dulls the senses. But this is the remarkable truth, and I am sure of it: I experience boundless pleasure in living, and I will take boundless satisfaction in dying.  \u2014Maurice Blanchot,  The Madness of the Day", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zQ3dsuLTzX48Gs5oydxoP06WUoR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
