An educational film preaching a fable-like message, it is however filled with humorous scenes that offset the film\u2019s didacticism. Original director Yoshio Nishio fell ill and was replaced halfway through the shooting by the admired filmmaker Hiroshi Shimizu; though finished in May 1931, the film was shelved and never given a general release. Shot as a silent film, this version of the film features musical accompaniment, sound effects, and a spoken commentary track by a benshi narrator, thus bearing witness to the variety of forms taken by sound film during this transitional period.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Shoichi Nodera ()", "Teruyo Hayami ()", "Shoichi Kofujita ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
