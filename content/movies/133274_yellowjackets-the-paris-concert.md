At the peak of their creative art, Bob Mintzer (saxophone), Russell Ferrante (keyboards), Jimmy Haslip (bass) and Marcus Baylor (drums) played with the unaltered intensity &amp; jubilation of their 1981 debut when, as backing band for guitarist Robben Ford, they created the compelling, unmistakable Yellowjackets sound, combining bebop, funk, R&amp;B and rock influences. In the course of their 25 year career, the challenging team of improvising masters \u2013 14 time Grammy Award nominees &amp; twice winners \u2013 has turned into a driving force in contemporary music. We are proud to offer the Yellowjackets' countless fans this jewel of musical sophistication &amp; groove!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/deZ4wwSpULDYCbm6u6BXcm4KKsV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "L6l56SC4aoY"}
