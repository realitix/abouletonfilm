Her activists quickly caught the attention of the media by shocking actions carried bare toes, the body covered with slogans. In 2012, at the creation of Femen France, Caroline Fourest followed their actions. They notably affirmed their support for \"Marriage for All\" by protesting on November 18, 2012, during the demonstration organized by the Civitas Institute against the bill, provoking sharp clashes.\r An episode from \"Infrarouge XXL\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7NA0weufydvPGtw08NecUW2wW9x.jpg", "actors": ["Oksana Shachko ()", "Anna Hutsol ()", "Inna Shevchenko ()", "Sasha Shevchenko ()", "FEMEN ()", "Aliaa El Mahdy ()", "Safia Lebdi ()", "Loubna M\u00e9liane ()", "Nathalie Homs (Narrator)", "Doroth\u00e9e Pouss\u00e9o (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
