Although Klansmen bragged openly about what they did in 1964, no one was held accountable until 2005, when the State indicted preacher Edgar Ray Killen, an 80-year-old notorious racist and alleged mastermind of the killings. Through intimate interviews with the families of the victims, candid interviews with black and white Neshoba County Citizens, and exclusive, first time interviews with Killen, the film explores whether healing and reconciliation are possible without telling the unvarnished truth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zW7Ne8PNUURfu1rF1kwQgegN4O7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "cUfNttzqV4U"}
