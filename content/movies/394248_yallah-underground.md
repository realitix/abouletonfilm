Underground follows some of today\u2019s most influential and progressive artists in Arab underground culture from 2009 to 2013 and documents their work, dreams and fears in a time of great change for Arab societies.  In a region full of tension, young Arab artists in the Middle East have struggled for years to express themselves freely and to promote more liberal attitudes within their societies.  During the Arab Spring, like many others of this new generation, local artists had high hopes for the future and took part in the protests. However, after years of turmoil and instability, young Arabs now have to challenge both old and new problems, being torn between feelings of disillusion and a vague hope for a better future.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/94AXUukh3AsAsoucPJ7zaywlHY2.jpg", "actors": ["Zeid Hamdan (Himself)", "Maii Waleed Yassin (Herself)", "Ostaz Samm (Himself)", "Amer Shomali (Himself)", "Mayaline Hage (Herself)", "Donia Massoud (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "sx5AC9jy6cE"}
