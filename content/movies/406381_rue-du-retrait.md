Secondly,the making of this film will always remain a miracle of sorts for Ren\u00e9 F\u00e9ret as no big production house was willing to finance such a brave,absolutely uncommon film in France.So this film was finally made due to Ren\u00e9 F\u00e9ret's personal intervention and highly individual efforts. Its visual style was applauded by a great French filmmaker named Bertrand Tavernier who has long been one of Ren\u00e9 F\u00e9ret's admirers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/srsiH5s4XtgHfRXKiYC5XZ0O6mD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
