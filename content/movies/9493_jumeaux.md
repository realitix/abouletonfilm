Julius was raised on a gorgeous island, he is greatly educated and knows no fear of the world, Vincent on the other hand is a low class womanising weasel from the big city. Upon learning of having a twin brother, Julius sets off to the big city to find the brother he never knew he had, trouble is, is that Julius has no comprehension of city ways, and coupled with the fact that Vincent really isn't the brotherly kind, this only compounds the situation further.\r\n\r\nTwins is a very tidy piece, the two leads play off of each other very well, and as dumb as the plotting is, it sure as hell makes for a good fun night viewing. Female gravitas comes in the form of the sultry Kelly Preston and the criminally undervalued Chloe Webb, but really the film's charm is all down to the little and large act of DeVito & Schwarzenegger, plenty of laughs here. So open the ale, chomp on the popcorn, and leave the brain at the door. 7/10\r\n\r\nYakety Yak, Yakety Yak."}], "recommandations_id": [6280, 951, 9593, 9268]}
