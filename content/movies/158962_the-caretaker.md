A vampire, who has also occupied the mansion, offers them a deal: if they protect him from humans during the day, he'll protect them from other vampires at night. So begins an uneasy alliance which soon threatens to fall apart.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uwZ6xpxIY2PJBIx6uQ7Pm34SYWe.jpg", "actors": ["Anna Burgess (Annie)", "Clint Dowdell (Guy)", "Colin MacPherson (Lester)", "Lee Mason (Ron)", "Mark White (Dr. Ford Grainger)", "Kerri-Anne Baker (The Doctor)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "darkmast3r", "content": "While there is no denying that Vampires play a central role in this movie, I would challenge its pigeonholing as a genre film. Underneath the gore and fangs and horror is a simple story about humanity and survival. Each of the characters is unlikeable yet fragile, likable yet horrifying, showing us the complexity of human nature and human relationships. The actors and filmmakers did a wonderful job of bringing these characters to life and imbuing them with a sense of reality, as opposed to the sometimes stereotypical caricatures that often find their way into these type of films. On top of that the filmic style and colour palette used by the filmmakers gives the film a beautiful, rich visual feel."}], "recommandations_id": [76922, 225898, 268940, 26656], "youtube_key": "18N-53_hnjA"}
