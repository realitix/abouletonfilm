Trying to fill a void in her life, Maggie feels the need to locate her birth mother. What she finds is not what she hoped for. Maggie finds a mother that does not love her or want her. Maggie gets caught up in this woman's world. After a few months enough becomes enough and when all hope is lost, one desperate night she reaches her breaking point. In a rage, she releases her frustrations by destroying the seedy hotel room that has been her home. At her feet falls a Bible, and it is then she realizes that there is only one thing that can break the bondage she is in and that is Jesus Christ our Savior.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8SQduGTnlS8X56LQmvxxJ9dfYZf.jpg", "actors": ["Grant Barker (Derrick Sirron)", "Ron Bath (Homeless Guy)", "Barry Brown (John)", "LaZaundra Burris (Lady of the Night)", "Kimberly Lynn Campbell (Lady of the Night)", "Alicia Ceaser (Lady of the Night)", "Samantha Conrad (Lady of the Night)", "Emily De Nisi (Claire)", "Jack Elliott (Luther (as John Elliott))", "Ali Faulkner (Maggie Sirron)", "Ted Ferguson (Walden)", "Jessica Flowers (Lady of the Night)", "Ethan Hirschy (John)", "Nicole Holt (Lady of the Night)", "Sheran Goodspeed Keyton (Grace)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
