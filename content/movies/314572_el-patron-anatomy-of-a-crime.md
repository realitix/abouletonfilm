Herm\u00f3genes, a farmhand from northern Argentina, relocates to Buenos Aires in search of a better life for himself and his young wife, but soon finds himself at the mercy of a corrupt boss. The film is based on a thorough investigation of a real event that happened in Buenos Aires 10 years ago. Almost every scene in the film is inspired by real facts or based on well documented daily practices of the \u201cmeat business\u201d and its environment. Both a shocking expos\u00e9 of unscrupulous practices in the meat industry and a heart-wrenching personal story, El Patr\u00f3n became one of the most successful Argentine films of 2014.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b7KxSqMAEAfHki9W2iqVFXnWpdk.jpg", "actors": ["Germ\u00e1n de Silva (Armando)", "Joaqu\u00edn Furriel (Hermogenes)", "Luis Ziembrowski (Latuada)", "Guillermo Pfening (Marcelo Di Giovanni)", "M\u00f3nica Lairana (Gladys)", "Victoria Raposo (Clara)", "Andrea Garrote (Nora (Secretaria del Juzgado))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [470818], "youtube_key": "h2eV-cSMpIU"}
