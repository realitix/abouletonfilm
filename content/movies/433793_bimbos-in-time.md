Along the way they meet King Arthur, Sherlock Holmes, Jack The Ripper, Matt Dillon, a whole gang of gunfighters...and even ELVIS! Forget about Bill and Ted, these Bimbos really know how to have an excellent adventure! Full of hot girls, bad comedy, not so special effects, and nonstop action - this is one seriously screwed up Sci-Fi comedy that you don't want to miss!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5PyRULufKuiqVqJou7IUlpNXSEi.jpg", "actors": ["Tonia Monahan (Trianna)", "Jenny Admire (Dillea)", "Veronica Orr (Doc)", "Holly Starr (Gabrielle)", "Deric Bernier (Salacious Thatch)", "Matthew Lewis (Larry)", "Cathy Metz ()", "Todd Sheets ()", "Carol Barta ()", "Jerry Angell ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
