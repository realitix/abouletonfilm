Ethan, one of the town's residents, is a young father but not much more than a kid himself. He has no choice but to look after his three-year-old son Nate, since mom Cindy is an alcoholic. But one snowy day, Ethan's good intentions are thwarted by a moment of thoughtlessness, resulting in tragedy. A local prosecutor haunted by his past goes after Ethan, and the ensuing confusion and casting of blame begins to tear the town apart.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qpSXab96gQ1u69BVQO6dxsIaTt9.jpg", "actors": ["Thomas Dekker (Ethan)", "Elizabeth McGovern (Jane)", "Mira Sorvino (Angie)", "Jeremy Piven (Jack)", "Emma Macgillivray (Rosie)", "Greg Lawson (Bill)", "Chris Ippolito (Will)", "Lynn Collins (Cindy)", "Colin A.
