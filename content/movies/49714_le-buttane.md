The film lacks a real unifying thread as it presents scenes from the lives of 7 hookers. Five are women. One is a man, and one is a transvestite. In one episode, an aging ill-mannered Neapolitan, Orlanda, entertains North African visitors in her home. They do not seem to mind her constant barrage of racist comments. One of her clients falls for her and protects her from a client who stalks her. She is surprised. The male prostitute finds himself becoming violent after his client is too attentive. Liucca gets beaten in lieu of a payment. A mother struggles with her profession and homelife. Grimaldi dehumanizes clients.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nfhi5DBAQEynChmUzAc41zIRcTK.jpg", "actors": ["Ida Di Benedetto (Orlanda)", "Guia Jelo (Liuccia)", "Lucia Sardo (Milu)", "Sandra Sindoni (Blu Blu)", "Paola Pace (Veronica)", "Alessandra Di Sanzo (Kim)", "Marco Leonardi (Maurizio)", "Adriano Chiaramida ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
