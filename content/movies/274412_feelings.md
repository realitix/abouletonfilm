The film depicts a chaotic period through the relationship of the two brothers, one dedicated to his family and conscience; the other dedicated to a political ideal. These divided brothers can be read as a representation of a country torn in two, of a history rudely divided. Lithuania has a history of occupation and the struggle to survive is as much personal as it is cultural.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kPoUN6pexTRZ6t1jYAI16n2dqjC.jpg", "actors": ["Regimantas Adomaitis (Kasparas)", "Juozas Budraitis (Andrius)", "Regina Paliukaityt\u0117 (Agn\u0117)", "Bronius Babkauskas (Policeman Vaitkevi\u010dius)", "Eugenija Bajoryt\u0117 (Morta)", "Gediminas Girdvainis ()", "Algimantas Masiulis ()", "Aurelia Mikushauskayte ()", "Laimonas Noreika ()", "Vytautas Pauk\u0161t\u0117 ()", "Balys Barauskas (Russian Soldier)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
