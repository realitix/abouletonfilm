While touching very briefly on the turtles of Galapagos and a bit more in-depth on two varieties of iguana and a species of crab, the documentary focuses primarily on birds, including several species of penguin on at least two of the islands, cormorants, frigate birds and the albatross.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zbZtAByJXBxs8vBzwTQKWWPawDx.jpg", "actors": ["Winston Hibler (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
