Using the return address on the birthday card, Amy makes it her mission to track down her real father in Texas, and have the family she always wanted. She meets a trucker named Tom who just so happens to be heading there. But catching a ride with the reluctant hauler isn't going to be easy. Tom's got problems of his own... a marriage in tatters, a teenage daughter adrift in the wreckage, and now a hot young thing in the next seat. Welcome to B. Skow's Runaway, where sex is hot and sticky, everyone's got a truck and a gun, and family is whoever will take you in. With Capri Anderson, Lisa Ann, Phoenix Marie and three scorching anals... in other words, a Runaway you won't be running from.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u0kZLqCW1cZLG6IcIRi2QOCkwxf.jpg", "actors": ["Capri Anderson (Amy)", "Tom Byron (Tom)", "Asphyxia Noir (Macy)", "Skin Diamond (Blake)", "Lisa Ann (Amy's Mom)", "Phoenix Marie (Gloria)", "India Summer (Tom's Wife)", "Jessi Palmer (Tom's Daughter)", "Barry Scott (barry)", "Jerry (Dirty Guy)", "Mark Wood (John)", "Tommy Gunn (Amy's Dad)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
