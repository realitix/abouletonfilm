Pierrot is a freaky mime who ventures into a mirror where he falls in love and rolls around with the equally grotesque Columbine. But when Columbine spurs him for Harlequin, Pierrot's jealousy takes over and drives him to murder. Cloud, perched on a ladder, watches over the proceedings and narrates in song.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qxPyJM8AYUNOr4Kbee9ZcqCVBe7.jpg", "actors": ["David Bowie (Cloud)", "Lindsay Kemp (Pierrot)", "Annie Stainer (Columbine)", "Jack Birkett (Harlequin)", "Michael Garrett (Piano Player)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
