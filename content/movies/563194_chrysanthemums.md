They create magical circles of flowers from which other women emerge. The dancers construct an elegant floral display, in the middle of which a miniature dancer performs. Another circle of flowers is brought forward on the stage, toward the camera, and in the circle are shown a series of women. The original pair of dancers conclude by twirling their parasols.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w9bKSHS7Zvu2VLosRhnNyP1U7Te.jpg", "actors": ["Julienne Mathieu ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
