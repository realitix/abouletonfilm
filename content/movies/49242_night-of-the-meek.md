Getting fired for his drinking, Corwin is bewildered when he finds what appears to be a magic sack that distributes the exact presents requested by Corwin's friends and the neighbourhood children. But this is just the start of things...\r\n\r\nOne of the episodes that was filmed on videotape, Night of the Meek is kept to a production value minimum. Yet it really doesn't matter, the feel of a snowy Christmas comes alive as Corwin stumbles and trudges through this little part of Americana. The story is a perfect blend of comedy and drama, with Rod Serling sprinkling his magical whimsy into the pudding mix. And of course we are being led by our hearts to a glorious finale, for this is when the title comes to make sense.\r\n\r\nWith Carney giving a magnetic two-fold performance to seal the deal, this really should be on everyone's annual Xmas viewings list. 9/10"}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
