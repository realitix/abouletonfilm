She has a brother, eccentric as well as invading, who serves as a go-between between the fickle young woman and her lovers. She has been the mistress of Richard for a while when Jeff, an engaging but but unrepentant dreamer, falls madly in love with her. Marceline first turns him down but finally accepts him after she breaks up with Richard. But the coquette has not given up her escapades to which the young florist, nicknamed \"Jean de la Lune\" for his naivety, turns a blind eye. Little time after their wedding , Marceline becomes infatuated with the good looks of a superficial young man, Alexandre. But Jeff, who has developed a fondness for Jean, intervenes to save the couple.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wKD6C4Lfk3BWO92HHr7uInsxMeu.jpg", "actors": ["Danielle Darrieux ()", "Claude Dauphin ()", "Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier ()", "Pierre Dux ()", "Jeannette Batti ()", "Lucienne Granier ()", "Genevi\u00e8ve Morel ()", "Camille Gu\u00e9rini ()", "Jacques Sernas ()", "Jos\u00e9e Ariel ()", "Albert Broquin ()", "Yves Deniaud ()", "Arsenio Freignac ()", "Lydia Greynor ()", "Charles Lavialle ()", "Christian Martaguet ()", "Yves Massard ()", "Albert Michel ()", "Fran\u00e7oise Pr\u00e9vost ()", "Georges Van Parys ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
