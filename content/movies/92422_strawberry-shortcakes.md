The main characters, impeccably played by four powerful actresses, are modern, self-sufficient women and their stories are told with mild irony and a dash of melancholy. The result is a movie that is lighthearted at times, a little sad at others, crazy and sometimes serious, but always special, that investigates the psychology of its characters and offers an accurate depiction of urban Japan, thanks to its director\u2019s know-how. While many overly ambitious directors struggle to tell even one fairly comprehensible story, Yazaki skillfully weaves a powerful depiction of not one, but four women, creating an indissoluble and moving whole that doesn\u2019t succumb to sentimentalism.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s6n1woXpGRKDJllx0734iigumHb.jpg", "actors": ["Chizuru Ikewaki (Satoko)", "Y\u00fbko Nakamura (Akiyo)", "Noriko Nakagoshi (Chihiro)", "Kiriko Nananan (Toko (as Toko Iwase))", "Ryo Kase (Nagai)", "Masanobu Ando (Kikuchi)", "Y\u00f4ko Ishino (Doctor)", "Kiyomi It\u014d (Matsushita)", "Asami Katsura (Sakie)", "Ayaka Maeda (Michiru)", "Chieko Misaka ()", "Tomomi Miyashita (Yuri)", "Seminosuke Murasugi (Morio)", "Hitomi Nakahara (Machiko)", "K\u00f4en Okumura (Tadokoro)", "Taro Suwa (Client)", "Mai Takahashi ()", "Kenichi Yajima (Osaki)", "Kazushi Hosaka (Client)", "Akito Inui (Client)", "Ei Takatori (Client)", "Tamiyasu Cho (Lee)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [108931, 96754, 49939, 15496], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
