For as long as he could remember, twelve year old Tom Canty had dreamed of being a Prince. Whenever he was not begging for money for his cruel father, Tom played \"being Prince\" with his friends. Tom Canty and Prince Edward, the soon to be king, bear a striking resemblance to one another and decide to swap places. Unfortunately, the once innocent trick turns into a nightmare, and the Pauper and the Prince become desperate in their struggle to prove their real identity before it is too late and the Pauper is crowned King.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wjWiq2NdaOyda7rIHK6bPO0CTLy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
