The husband, around 35, works as a tax specialist for an import-export firm. His 30-year-old wife looks after their child and their home. The man's impending promotion at work triggers their dreams of social advancement and financial improvement. As their plain everyday life unfolds the characters are denuded to reveal their different needs and desires which render their functioning and communication increasingly hard. The man's inability to meet the escalating demands of his social circle and those of his wife brings tension into their relationship and leads to the culmination of the drama. The unexpected as well as extreme solution given by the heroine leads both the hero and the viewer to redefine reality on the basis of how things look and how they really are.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f1ZQwICWoABMzgpasgJ1Q6k2sbL.jpg", "actors": ["Evi Saoulidou (Woman)", "Vasilis Andreou (Man)", "Constantine Giannaris (Employer)", "Rania Oikonomidou (Mother)", "Marisha Triantafyllidou (Friend # 1)", "Yannis Stankoglou (Promotion supervisor)", "Athina Maximou (Friend # 2)", "Dimitris Imellos ()", "Alexandra Aidini ()", "Georgia Tsagaraki ()", "Vassilis Koukalani ()", "Georgia Mavroyorgi ()", "Vicky Harris ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
