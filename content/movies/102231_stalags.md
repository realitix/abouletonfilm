{"tmdb_id": 102231, "title": "Stalags", "original_title": "Stalags", "slug_title": "stalags", "date": "2008-04-09", "genre": ["Histoire / Documentaire / Guerre"], "score": "7.5/10", "synopsis": "Stalags were pocket books whose plots revealed lusty female SS officers sexually abusing camp prisoners. During the 1960s, parallel to the trial held against Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann, sales of this pornographic literature broke all records in Israel and hundreds of thousands of copies were sold at kiosks. The popularity of the Stalags only declined after a much-reported trial, in which their authors were accused of distributing anti-Semitic pornography. This film examines the notorious phenomenon, exposing the creators of this genre for the first time. It posits that the combination of pornography and the Holocaust also appears in canonic Holocaust literature and continues to be a widespread part of the representation of the Holocaust in Israel today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jBgtp5Y17K1kDfERaWlwLyVzmJf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
