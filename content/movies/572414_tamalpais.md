A view of landscape is taken apart, to be reconstituted through memory. The grid, a reference to the \u201cveil of threads\u201d invented by Albrecht D\u00fcrer as an aid for perspective drawing \u2013 to transfer vision to a sheet of paper \u2013 is used for an opposite effect \u2013 to disperse a landscape across time. The viewer is asked to remember the space as it passes and reconstitute it from memory, actively connecting the image across space and time.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
