Behavior rules are applied to thousands of individual particles to model complex phenomena such as an explosion, a snowstorm, a tumultuous head, and a waterfall. A Connection Machine CM-2 computer was used to perform physical simulations on thousands of particles simultaneously, one processor for each particle.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vpIN11Fgs1A0ys1gd2jWhPKOO3G.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
