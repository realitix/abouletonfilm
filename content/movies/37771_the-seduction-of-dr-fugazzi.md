But beneath her perfect life and calm exterior lies a deadly secret that she herself cannot imagine, much less confront!!! There is a delicate balance between reality and illusion, between conscious and the subconscious, and for Dr. Fugazzi, the truth lies somewhere in between the beauty of her present life and the horror of the not-too-distant past!!! Shocked by hallucinations and deadly images, tantalized by familiar, eerie voices, provoked by her deranged and knowing patients, and daily nightmares that awaken her in a strange, white room, Dr. Fugazzi takes an inhuman journey into her very psyche!!!!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jTRagoL3grEpEKf7d1UVJxxVeG3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
