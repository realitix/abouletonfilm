Lurf playfully shows how cinema turned the stars into endless metaphors, dreams, and warm blankets. There is no story or characters \u2014 only movie scenes worked together outside of their contexts. We put our own thoughts into the stunning scenes while each clip\u2019s sound design presents us with ambience, brief dialogue, or loud music. The editing enthralls us as space is not depicted the same in every clip. If you have a love affair with movies and the sky, \u2605 is the ultimate romantic art film.\" Sundance Film Festival in January 2018", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6Y12U1kOdT9tQm0We4IIdVyjDMi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
