Cannonball Adderley (alto sax), Nat Adderley (cornet) and the masterful Yusef Lateef (tenor sax, flute, oboe), provide a massive three-horn frontline attack, while the stellar rhythm section featuring a pre-Weather Report Joe Zawinul (piano), Sam Jones (bass) and Louis Hayes (drums) fuel the songs with a deep infectious swing. Quincy Jones\u2019 \u201cJessica\u2019s Day\u201d leaps from the gate with a huge \u201cbig band\u201d sound that is extraordinary for only six musicians. This DVD is a reminder that Cannonball Adderley was one of the most outstanding and highly respected alto saxophonists in the history of jazz, a blues-based jazzman who could play anything in superb fashion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b1fj1giq4ZViqTvyOQGrib4QqLF.jpg", "actors": ["Cannonball Adderley (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
