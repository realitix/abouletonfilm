The event will be the second that the promotion has hosted in Pittsburgh, and first since UFC Live: Kongo vs. Barry in June of 2011. It was originally expected to be headlined by a welterweight bout between former UFC Lightweight Championship challenger Donald Cerrone and Tim Means. On February 3, it was announced that Means was informed of a potential USADA anti-doping policy violation stemming from an out-of-competition sample collection. Because there was insufficient time for a full review and proper promotion before the scheduled bout, Means was pulled from the fight by the UFC. The following day, Alex Oliveira was announced as his replacement.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tdYMOitb2tr3htFmtiIG17vUG3Y.jpg", "actors": ["Donald Cerrone (himself)", "Alex Oliveira (himself)", "Derek Brunson ()", "Roan Carneiro ()", "Cody Garbrandt ()", "Dennis Bermudez ()", "Chris Camozzi ()", "James Krause ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
