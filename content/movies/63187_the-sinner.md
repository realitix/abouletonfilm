The Italian title translates as The Moon-Skinned Girl, a reference to the amazingly attractive Zeudi Araya, who made two other films with the same director. As a film it really typifies the 'eurotika' of the 1970s - the story concerns a couple with marital problems who escape to the Seychelles and the husband meets - and has an affair with - the title character. The wife meanwhile meets an ex-pat living there (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart!) with whom she has a fling. The couple realise their love for each other and return home stronger for it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gZ1UvDlYaD5ZTo2sR4VjTlGPdos.jpg", "actors": ["Ugo Pagliai (Alberto)", "Beba Lon\u010dar (Helen)", "Zeudi Araya Cristaldi (Simone)", "Giacomo Rossi-Stuart (Giacomo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "nUsTXAmXGys"}
