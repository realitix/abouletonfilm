Before the concert songs kick in, this set begins with a studio recording of a previously unreleased song, \"Aime\", exclusive to this album. The rest of the concert recordings feature repertoire from Fabian's 2005 album \"9\" and the other older songs that pre-date the \"9\" song are all performed acoustically. Some had to be entirely reworked to fit the concept of this live show. In addition, Fabian delivers a tribute to her idol Barbra Streisand by performing \"Papa Can You Hear Me\" and \"A Piece of Sky\", both from the soundtrack of Streisand's film tour de force \"Yentl\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cw5pz6QZhfhgD1EWUNKl0IR57kF.jpg", "actors": ["Lara Fabian (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "K4W2MSn1bgs"}
