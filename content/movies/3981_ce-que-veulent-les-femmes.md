Il aspire au poste de directeur de la cr\u00e9ation, mais ses sup\u00e9rieurs hi\u00e9rarchiques engagent \u00e0 sa place Darcy McGuire, sa grande rivale. Nick n'est pas tr\u00e8s heureux \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e de collaborer avec elle. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, ses campagnes publicitaires ne correspondent plus \u00e0 ce que les femmes recherchent. Il doit donc trouver de nouveaux concepts qui collent davantage \u00e0 leurs aspirations.Un soir, Nick s'\u00e9lectrocute accidentellement chez lui. Le lendemain, il est surpris d'entendre des remarques d\u00e9plac\u00e9es de la part de ses coll\u00e8gues f\u00e9minines. Cependant, il est encore plus surpris, lorsqu'il se rend compte qu'il n'entend pas leurs paroles, mais qu'il lit dans leurs pens\u00e9es. Nick r\u00e9alise bient\u00f4t qu'il peut tourner ce don \u00e0 son avantage.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xiL4PMdL2b5RRdsfEkGmaol2ScW.jpg", "actors": ["Mel Gibson (Nick Marshall)", "Helen Hunt (Darcy McGuire)", "Marisa Tomei (Lola)", "Alan Alda (Dan Wanamaker)", "Lauren Holly (Gigi)", "Mark Feuerstein (Morgan Farwell)", "Ashley Johnson (Alexandra Marshall)", "Delta Burke (Eve)", "Diana Maria Riva (Stella)", "Eric Balfour (Cameron)", "Judy Greer (Erin)", "Sarah Paulson (Annie)", "Logan Lerman (Young Nick Marshall)", "Lisa Edelstein (Dina)", "Robin Pearson Rose (Kitchen Secretary)", "Christopher Emerson (Mail Room Kid)", "Ashlee Turner (Woman in Library)", "Sierra Pecheur (Woman at Lunch Counter)", "Valerie Perrine (Margo)", "Ana Gasteyer (Sue Cranston)", "Loretta Devine (Flo the Doorwoman)", "Andrea Baker (Office Intern)", "Joe Petcka (Man on Street)", "Brian Callaway (Man on Street)", "Coburn Goss (Man on Street)", "Perry Cavitt (Ogling Man)", "Crystal McKinney (Unimpressed Woman)", "Jeanne Marie Rice (Unimpressed Woman)", "Kathrin Middleton (Gigi's Friend)", "Kelly Cooper (Showgirl)", "Palmer Davis (Showgirl)", "Katie Miller (Showgirl)", "Dana Waters (Nick's Mom)", "Gregory Cupoli (Male Role Model)", "Alexondra Lee (Woman in Pink Sweater)", "Aviva Gale (Counter Girl)", "Shirley Prestia (Coffee Shop Customer)", "T.
