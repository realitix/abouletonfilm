The \u201cKrone\u2019s\u201d 2.7 million readers represent 43% of the Austrian press market. A reflection of the Austrian soul, this newspaper serves as a prism through which we can understand the rise of the populist Right in this country and examine the dangerous flirtation between media and politics. Director and editor-in-chief Hans Dichand\u2019s ingenious populist strategy allows him to reach the greatest number of readers: the paper\u2019s style and content play on base human instincts such as the fear of the \u201cother,\u201d the opposition between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil,\u201d and the common man\u2019s sense of powerlessness in the political arena. He then wields the might of this enormous audience to influence politicians and impose his nostalgic vision of a pure, prosperous, and peaceful world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ecl6bRJd4u24e3rNZROeayUOozY.jpg", "actors": ["Hans Dichand (Himself)", "Erhard Busek (Himself)", "J\u00f6rg Haider (Himself)", "Thomas Klestil (Himself)", "Aylin Yay (Narrator (voice))", "Andreas M\u00f6lzer (Himself)", "Heide Schmidt (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
