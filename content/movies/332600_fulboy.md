Martin, never able to fulfill his own dream of playing football, steps into the world of Tom\u00e1s and his teammates through the lens of his camera. However, the rest of the club has their own opinions, some viewing Martin as an intruder, as he exposes their most vulnerable moments, and their concerns for the future after the game has ended. Fulboy offers an uncensored, confessional look at how the athletes behind the most popular sport in the world behave during their time off the field. At the same time, Fulboy reflexively interrogates Farina's aesthetic choices and point-of-view, as well as the viewer's gaze at the male form.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b26GUUHUz9dYHfB2plvDRgV495P.jpg", "actors": ["Tom\u00e1s Farina (Himself)", "Jorge Luis Medina (Himself)", "Gonzalo Peralta (Himself)", "Facundo Tal\u00edn (Himself)", "Cristian Vergara (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "7jeI9CYgGoA"}
