Montes (Sergio Goyri) is a none-too-bright yokel from the country who heads into the big city with his best friend Juan (Charly Valentino) to buy a pickup truck. Montes wants to get his vehicle and head on home, but Juan persuades him to take in some of the sights of the big city first. It turns out, however, that Montes had the right idea for a change; while visiting a night spot, they accidentally spy a gang of jewel thieves who are forced to kill someone, and when the crooks give chase, Montes and Juan must spend the night running for their lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wVpWzagtz106FWUW9Iok3pmAxYg.jpg", "actors": ["Sergio Goyri ()", "Gabriela Goldsmith ()", "Charly Valentino ()", "C\u00e9sar Sobrevals ()", "Antonio Raxel ()", "Sergio Barrios ()", "Gustavo Aguilar Tejada ()", "Guillermo Lagunes ()", "Blanca Romero ()", "Luis Guevara ()", "Alejandro de la Pe\u00f1a ()", "Roberto Ruy ()", "Manolo C\u00e1rdenas ()", "Julio Monje ()", "Tito Guill\u00e9n ()", "Arturo Farf\u00e1n ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
