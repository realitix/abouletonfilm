Eastovers refusal to sign a contract (when the miners joined with the United Mine Workers of America) led to the strike, which lasted more than a year and included violent battles between gun-toting company thugs/scabs and the picketing miners and their supportive women-folk. Director Barbara Kopple puts the strike into perspective by giving us some background on the historical plight of the miners and some history of the UMWA.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yK7msgWlLhIa5fduQNz7FUAlxTQ.jpg", "actors": ["Norman Yarborough (Himself - Eastover Mining President)", "Houston Elmore (Himself - UMW organizer)", "Phil Sparks (Himself - UMW staff)", "Bessie Lou Cornett (Herself)", "Lois Scott (Herself)", "Sudie Crusenberry (Herself)", "Mary Lou Fergerson (Herself)", "Basil Collins (Himself - mine foreman)", "Florence Reece (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [112698, 126189, 97517, 126216], "youtube_key": "iCiVMngILEI"}
