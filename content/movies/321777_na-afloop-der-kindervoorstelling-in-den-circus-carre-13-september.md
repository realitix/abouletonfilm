Often the images were shown only a few days after they had been shot. These screenings attracted many curious viewers who enjoyed looking for images of themselves, of relatives, or acquaintances.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
