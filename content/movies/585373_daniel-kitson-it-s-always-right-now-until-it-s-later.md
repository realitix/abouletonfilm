It then went to London and New York before finally, Manchester, where we made this film in 2012.  \"We\" is Ewan Jones Morris, a number of camera and sound people he employed and myself - Daniel John Kitson. I wanted to film it in the round, and keep the shots as wide as we generally could, in order to maintain the presence of the audience and negate the need for reassuring cutaways to a person laughing.  Ewan came up with using fixed focal length on the cameras, in order to establish and maintain the geography of the stage. So bloody good on him.  And. It's in real time, we didnt take a second out, as will be clear from time to time.  I think thats everything you need to know.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vp9uF8jnRR69E1clm00IwNxJTqm.jpg", "actors": ["Daniel Kitson ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
