Just look at the case of Marni. For starters, she gets gang raped by some thugs at a campground. And then she goes home to be comforted by her caring boyfriend, who recently confessed his love and took her virginity, only to find him in bed with another woman. When she starts acting out, her parents hand her over to an uncle who also rapes her. She miscarries shortly after finding out she's pregnant and is finally put out of her misery after her rapists murder her and then toss her body in a lake. Unfortunately, in death the poor girl can't even rest in peace and she returns as a vengeance-seeking ghost because her body wasn't properly buried. Now that you know all about Marni, don't you feel better?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lg4QCHWCICBDILJ5mt44cyvTW4l.jpg", "actors": ["Sally Marcelina (Marni)", "Irwan Setiawan (Leo)", "Gunawan (Agus)", "Rina Hasyim ()", "Kusno Sudjarwadi (Kyai)", "Rendy Recky ()", "Johny Anwar ()", "Piet Burnama ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
