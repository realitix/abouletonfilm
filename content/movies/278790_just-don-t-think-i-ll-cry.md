He gets suspended for writing an essay that his teachers consider to be a challenge to the state. Just Don't Think I'll Cry became one of twelve films and film projects-almost an entire year's production-that were banned in 1965-1966 due to their alleged anti-socialist aspects. Although scenes and dialogs were altered and the end was reshot twice, officials condemned this title as \"particularly harmful.\" In 1989, cinematographer Ost restored the original version, and this and most of the other banned films were finally screened in January 1990. Belatedly, they were acclaimed as masterpieces of critical realism.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j3s5r63lInLvDyux8dAKWJJzES7.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Reusse (Peter Neumann)", "Anne-Kathrein Kretzschmar (Anne)", "Hans Hardt-Hardtloff (Annes Vater)", "Jutta Hoffmann (Uschi)", "Helga G\u00f6ring (Frau Naumann)", "Harry Hindemith (Herr Naumann)", "Herbert K\u00f6fer (Herr R\u00f6hle)", "Fred Delmare (Brigadier)", "Carmen-Maja Antoni (Studentin mit Brille)", "Arno Wyzniewski ()", "Horst Buder ()", "Alexander Lang ()", "Uwe Karpa ()", "Werner Dissel ()", "Armin Mechsner ()", "Gerhard Klein ()", "Frank Michelis (Meister)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
