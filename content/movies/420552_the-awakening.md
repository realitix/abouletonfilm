Luckily her husband works for a top secret government project and has just the cure she needs. Unfortunately there is one side effect, it gives her super human strength! This is the plot of The Awakening, another b-movie from filmmaker Mike Conway. Everything in the film is on par with extreme low budget films, that is except the effects. Conway is somehow able to pull off amazing results in which the viewer doesn\u2019t even realize they\u2019re seeing a special effect. Hence the three star rating for this film. If you want to see the possibilities available to you for creating a low budget feature, get this DVD. The \u201cmaking of\u201d documentary on this one is a very interesting watch. As for the feature itself, the storyline is exactly what you\u2019d expect. Girl is sick, gets a cure that turns her superhuman, loses control of her powers and winds up being pursued by government agents.
