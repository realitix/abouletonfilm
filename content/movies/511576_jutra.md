Excerpts from family films, interviews, and clips from some of Jutra's well-known works are seamlessly intertwined with these sequences, forming a portrait of a man whose life was devoted to creativity. Jutra is simultaneously a homage, a love letter to cinema, and the dramatic story of a brilliant artist whose life was all-too-short.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5UNYiGKHqNc0h8EHMaMkTTBD4NU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
