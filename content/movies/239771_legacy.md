Based on Alan Judd's 2001 novel Legacy, the second in the Thoroughgood series after 1981's A Breed Of Heroes (adapted by the BBC in 1994).\r As the three day week, petrol rationing and industrial strife plunge Britain into a state of emergency, MI6 trainee spy Charles Thoroughgood is asked to reconnect with an old university friend, Russian diplomat Viktor Koslov, with a view to 'turning' him. Viktor has his own agenda, though, and reveals a shocking truth about Charles's own family that threatens to derail him, both personally and professionally.\r He is catapulted into a dangerous personal odyssey to uncover the truth but finds himself drawn into a lethal KGB plot to mount an attack within the UK. His life is further complicated by a relationship with the wife of another agent, which forces him to realise that betrayal can take many forms.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ewrTS8jzXgkiNH4a8aRDpo3tDOZ.jpg", "actors": ["Charlie Cox (Charles Thoroughgood)", "Romola Garai (Anna March)", "Andrew Scott (Viktor Koslov)", "Christian McKay (Hugo March)", "Simon Russell Beale (Hookey)", "Richard McCabe (Gerry)", "Olivia Grant (Eva Pym)", "Geraldine James (Martha)", "Tessa Peake-Jones (Joyce Thoroughgood)", "Robert Ashby (Annikov)", "Alec Utgoff (Rhykov)", "Charlotte Randle (Emily)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "AqhYESNyA2I"}
