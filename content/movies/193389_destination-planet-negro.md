Using technology created by George Washington Carver, a three-person crew (plus one rambunctious robot) lift-off in Earth's first working spaceship on a mission that will take them to a world not unlike present-day America. Their spacey adventure illuminates some hard truths about American culture, and threatens to undermine the time-line of history along the way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yZtMbw8HDKmT0FxWPJbi84IeGGb.jpg", "actors": ["Tosin  Morohunfola (Capt.
