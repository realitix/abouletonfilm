Focusing on how nails are made, we first see a blacksmith laboring at his forge, shaping nails from single strands of steel rods. The scene then shifts from this peaceful setting to the roar of a 20th century nail mill, where banks of machines draw, cut, and pound the steel rods faster than the eye can follow.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xvpswXEjhki7nouxAr1j2g9tQP3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
