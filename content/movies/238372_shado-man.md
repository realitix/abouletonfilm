They call themselves the Freetown Streetboys, even though there are some women among them as well. Suley, Lama, David, Alfred, Shero and Sarah have all faced enormous physical and psychological challenges, and have been abandoned by the world around them. Without commentary and in poetic, cinematic images, the camera records the dark environment that they inhabit. The group shares their heartrending stories of the precarious nature of life in this complex country. But there is also room for everyday personal struggles, such as starting relationships, how to bring up children (or not), and sex.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jucHDw6TDP6hQSIMdHfOSON66XM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
