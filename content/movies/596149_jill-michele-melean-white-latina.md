From Miami to L.A. She's half Bolivian, half Irish but raised in Miami so Cuban by association. Not white enough to play the Stepford wife or Latin enough to play the gangsta but relatable to all ethnicities. From impressions, to family to dating, this special has her last 15 years of hilarious stories.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1lY1Cb7gQh4rHjBOD243fwApSyG.jpg", "actors": ["Jill-Michele Mele\u00e1n (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "XHtBnkdqW6g"}
