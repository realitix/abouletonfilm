In the story, a cheerfully naughty girl crosses paths with a witch who has the power to satisfy her curiosity about men by changing her into a young man. She then becomes one of the boy suitors for the amorous attentions of a policeman's daughter. Some of the men have unusual names and even odder magical gifts: one of them has the ability to make a man's genitals disappear when he shakes hands with him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pYMtgdgtPu2sxePjmeMeSMqNXxz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [128941, 158292, 145013, 125713], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
