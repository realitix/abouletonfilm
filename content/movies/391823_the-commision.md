Fascinated with the remarkable personality of genial violinist Niccola Paganini and his complicated relationship to Hector Berlioz (played by the artists Ernie Gusella and Robert Ashley), the author meditates over the intricacies of artistic geniality as connected not only with fame but also with the necessity of painful survival under the pressures of the art market.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
