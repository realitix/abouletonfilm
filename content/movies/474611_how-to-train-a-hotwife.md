Afraid that this might be a sign of bigger problems, Julia confides in her girlfriend, Violet about her fears only to discover that Violet's been hotwifing for years. Fascinated that happily married people can still engage in open sexual relationships, Julia and Carl begin testing their own limits as a couple. They role play a hotwifing scenario at home, Carl seeks advice from a friend who's frequently hired as a bull by other husbands, and Julia even heads out to a bar to practice flirting with other men. Aroused by her power as a sexual and emotionally ready for a new dimension in their relationship, Julia and Carl set out to turn fantasy into a reality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d7Pbnhnh1mp19RfMRbmo32qvVsM.jpg", "actors": ["Jade Nile (Julia)", "Richie Calhoun (Carl)", "Veruca James (Violet)", "Keira Nicole (Erik's Client, Wife)", "India Summer (Wife in Bar)", "Mick Blue (Mick)", "Erik Everhard (Erik)", "Jon Jon (Bar Couple's Partner)", "Toni Ribas (Roberto)", "Ryan McLane (Husband in Bar)", "Michael Vegas (Michael, Violet's Husband)", "Robby Echo (Erik's Client, Husband)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
