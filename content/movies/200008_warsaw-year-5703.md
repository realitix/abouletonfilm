Alek, entrusted with undeveloped photos of the horrors within, makes his way to a supposedly safe apartment only to find it occupied by Germans. Another tenant, a pole Stephania, abruptly offers to shelter him in her spacious apartment. She comforts him and they make love that very night. Stefania is uncommonly generous and willing to jeopardize her own safety by hiding a Jew. She even goes to a nearby church and rescues Fryda. But Fryda is ungrateful and proceeds to sabotage the trio's safety in insidious ways.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fCA5HdCTquF9wfqPnNDBNkrOJMN.jpg", "actors": ["Lambert Wilson (Alek)", "Hanna Schygulla (Stephania)", "Julie Delpy (Fryda)", "W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kowalski (Photographe)", "Piotr Cie\u015blak (Vicaire)", "Pawe\u0142 Nowisz (Sacristain)", "Leon Niemczyk (Officier)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
