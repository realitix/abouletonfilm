Young Josephine, an audacious performance by a 22-year-old Josephine Siao, is sentenced to an all-girl reform school on the periphery of Hong Kong after a violent bar brawl. Along with a few accomplices, she escapes from the intolerable administration, only to find the streets an even more hostile environment, driving the girls to blood-soaked vengeance. An enthralling youth-in-revolt film from the rare perspective of its female protagonists, shot in indelible widescreen color photography, Teddy Girls is one of Lung Kong\u2019s most enduring triumphs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/px6UR3W1vOZZR1WoOJOJQypqClD.jpg", "actors": ["Josephine Siao ()", "Patrick Lung Kong ()", "Mang Lee ()", "Nancy Sit Ka-Yin ()", "Teresa Ha Ping ()", "Lydia Shum ()", "Yip Ching ()", "Kenneth Tsang ()", "Wong Oi-Ming ()", "Seung-Goon Yuk ()", "Guo Man-Na ()", "Anna Tam ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
