Free love! Veganism! Experiments with drugs... The sixties, right? Not quite. In 1900 a group of middle class kids revolted against their time and started the original alternative community - Monte Verit\u00e0, the mountain of truth. A community based on veganism, feminism, pacifism and free love. This creative documentary mixes interviews, archive and animation in a beautiful combination bringing you straight back to the early 1900 as seen through the eyes of these young radicals. The documentary Freak Out tells the untold story of the birth of the alternative movement and unfold the uncanny similarities between our time and what they revolted against in the early 1900s.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bMb3ECVKaROrDz7GmwdHkXL1ZH4.jpg", "actors": ["Iben Hjejle (Ida Hoffman (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
