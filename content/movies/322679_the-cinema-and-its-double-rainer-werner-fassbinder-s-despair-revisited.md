Archival footage of Fassbinder is utilized (including several fascinating snippets culled from interviews he did at the disastrous Cannes premiere of Despair), as well as many others involved in the film and its release. Even if you're not a particular fan of Despair, or even in fact of Fassbinder, this is stellar documentary film making and is an intriguing look at one of the most enigmatic masters of the New German Cinema.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aDhPXrytsWUTqBx59tJznlF6gYx.jpg", "actors": ["Andr\u00e9a Ferr\u00e9ol (Herself)", "Michael Ballhaus (Himself)", "Tom Stoppard (Himself)", "Juliane Lorenz (Herself)", "Dieter Minx (Himself)", "Alexander Allerson (Himself)", "Harry Baer (Himself)", "Isolde Barth (Herself)", "John Coldstream (Himself)", "Brock Van Den Bogaerde (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
