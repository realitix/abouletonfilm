Danny, their waiter, comes by offering refills; after determining they are twins, he guesses which is the evil one. Without a pause, he sits down and offers his theory about Elvis's twin. He drones on. The good twin finally speaks up, giving her own opinion. The waiter is unfazed. After his boss finally calls him back to work, the twins are free to resume their bickering amidst the coffee and cigarettes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/esQd0eTBMdD33AF3VwMQvMIP9u9.jpg", "actors": ["Joie Lee (Good Twin)", "Cinqu\u00e9 Lee (Evil Twin)", "Steve Buscemi (Waiter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [472693, 68540, 148661, 301767], "youtube_key": "H2MyCmRrCaQ"}
