We will focus on the line's Pennsy Heritage and see remnants of the Pennsylvania Railroads legacy in the Louisville area.  We will visit Clagg Tower, the 14th Street bridge, which allowed the Pennsy to gain access to Louisville, former locations of the Pennsy roundhouse and engine facilities, Panama yard, and we will learn more about the history of the Pennsy's occupation in this area and more about the business and industries it once served.  The Keystone emblem is alive and well in 2015 and the LIRC carries the torch for one of the great fallen flags.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qLAYrr0CelPu48NSyX5spjxxC2U.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
