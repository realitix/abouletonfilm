Pupkin could be Travis Bickle's equally disturbed brother - both of them living in New York and both of them losing their minds in unison.\r\n\r\nAfter much rejection, the crazed Pupkin decides to kidnap his hero and hold him for ransom until a studio gives him a big break. Jerry Lewis is impressive as the total bastard that Pupkin so admires.\r\n\r\nA disturbing movie that is more relevant nowadays than ever since the advent of the Big Brother tv show which places national attention on people with no talent.\r\n\r\n- Ian Beale"}], "recommandations_id": [203, 592, 10843, 1578], "youtube_key": "0wVhCCo02P4"}
