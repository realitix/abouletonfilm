The view we see reflected in Gocho\u2019s photographic images has become more profound over time since his death and has struck a chord in people\u2019s hearts. While focusing on Gocho\u2019s collection of photographs Self and Others, the film also visits places associated with him, creating a collage with the manuscripts, letters, photographs and voice recordings remaining in an attempt to capture \u201cone more gesture\u201d\u2014a theme pursued by Gocho through photographic expression.  This film is neither a critical biography nor a monograph on the photographer. Rather, we are offered a new perception. As if mesmerized, the photographs Gocho left behind captivate us in their gaze.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3Q9Cc1vZzmtusfXxU3oWUbot6sY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
