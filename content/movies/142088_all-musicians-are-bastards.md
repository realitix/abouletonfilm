In reality, however, all her energy and talent is spent on relationships that eat away at her soul, mind-altering substances, and glamorous showing-off.  Heleri defies the rules. By playing with the possibilities of the art of film, she takes the viewer to an uneasy universe where the boundary between reality and illusion is incredibly thin. This is a world that is familiar to everyone who at some point in their life had to grow up and admit to themselves that dreaming is not enough on its own. And who have regardless of that chosen dreaming.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4KU6jz6chaoDm3dx5GtT71l4ZZx.jpg", "actors": ["Riina Maidre (Leila)", "Nero Urke (Toivo)", "Jarek Kasar (Shrek)", "Jaanika Arum (T\u00fcdruk)", "Helina Risti (Alice)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "sn4U_jdEb8M"}
