It is a tightly knit community that is on call to protect those within its boundaries. It is an intense, turbulent, passionate world, rarely depicted other than when the antagonisms and struggles of its young lives spill out onto the surrounding streets and into the news. West 10 LDN invites us into this territory, and delves into the big stories of the lives of the young, multi ethnic generation who live there - with a blast of energy and power, with dynamism, wit and blistering vibrancy.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Ashley Madekwe (Elisha)", "Noel Clarke (Michael)", "Ashley Walters (Lacey)", "Duane Henry (Orin)", "Adam Deacon (Nathan)", "Fraser Ayres (Ray)", "Nic\u00f4le Lecky (Danielle)", "Suzette Llewellyn (Veronica)", "Nina Wadia (Job Centre Clerk)", "Richard Angol (Punter)", "Josef Altin (Ratty)", "Jacob Anderson (Benji)", "Mikel Ameen (Little Stacey)", "Kamara Bacchus (Leonora)", "Ione Brown (Hooker 1)", "Davie Fairbanks (Younger Man)", "Madeleine Fairley (Lillian)", "Kyla Frye (Twawnda)", "Tamer Hassan (Gout)", "La Charne Jolly (Sissy)", "Sid Karne (Punter)", "Latoya Lees (Carolin)", "Dave Legeno (Older Man)", "Alexandra Mannion (Hooker 2)", "Nick Nevern (Maverick)", "Chinwe Nwokolo (Val)", "Demi Oyediran (Beth)", "Gary Schiffman (Crackhead)", "Kyle Summercorn (Johnny)", "Clive Dancey (Punter (uncredited))", "Abdul Sharif (Darren (uncredited))", "Andre Squire (Will)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
