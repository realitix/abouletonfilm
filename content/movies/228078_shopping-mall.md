It tells the story of Shiva, who is very good at studies, but is forced to work after his dad expires. He starts working at a Shopping Mall along with his village friend Buchi Babu, and he soon realizes that far from the way it looks from outside, the Shopping Mall is a jail in itself. They have to work for almost 16 hours a day, eat in hellhole conditions, and live like dogs. Inspite of all these, everyone seems to be working because of their own reasons.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a27DqOKdNfxVA4alZqRm1fsyBMx.jpg", "actors": ["Anjali (Rani)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
