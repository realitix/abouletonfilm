David and Madeline, on the other hand, are still struggling for their first big breaks. He's a screenwriter and she's an actress, which comes in handy when it comes to convincing Frank and Stephanie to let them use their guesthouse. You see, their relationship is entirely fictitious - designed to help them find decent accommodations while honing their crafts. The truth is they really can't stand each other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xXGujrpWSyQloZcRF0hXj9lIJm.jpg", "actors": ["Angela Nicholas (Stephanie (as Angela Davies))", "Brad Bartram (Frank (as Brad Bartmann))", "Kim Maddox (Madeline (as Kimberlee Castaic))", "Frank Mercuri (Ted)", "April Flowers (Amy (as Diana Espen))", "Jason Schnuit (Brian (as Dave Valeo))", "T.J.
