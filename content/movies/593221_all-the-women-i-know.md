In three insightful conversations with female friends, collaborators and high school students, the director looks for a discourse about fear that is not fearsome, a discourse on violence that is not violent.  Direct cinema, horizontal process, self-criticism and narrative breaks. Mostly, this is a tale of universal sorority.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ASbBYqHItSmtFVl7gKtnFKZhHG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
