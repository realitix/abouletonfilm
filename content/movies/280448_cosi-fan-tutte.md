Cecilia Bartoli leads an all-star cast including Roberto Sacc\u00e0, Liliana Nikiteanu, and Agnes Baltsa. The conductor is Nikolaus Harnoncourt.  Filmed live at the Zurich Opera House in February 2000 on a set which visualises the subtitle \"The School for Lovers\", the plot revolves around two army officers arguing about the fidelity of their brides, then setting out to test their chastity. Despite the often playful humour, this is not only psychologically telling music-making, but reveals Mozart exploring the structure of opera, discarding convention to mix large ensemble sections with arias for as many different combinations of singers as possible. With Liliana Nikiteanu attractively contrasted with Bartoli, and thoroughly convincing performances by Roberto Sacca (Ferrando) and Oliver Widmer (Guilelmo), this Cos\u00ec has a freshness and flow which, coupled with the timeless romantic themes, feels very contemporary.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Cecilia Bartoli (Fiordiligio)", "Agnes Baltsa (Despina)", "Liliana Nikiteanu (Dorabella)", "Roberto Sacca (Ferrando)", "Oliver Widmer (Guilelmo)", "Carlos Chausson (Don Alfonso)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
