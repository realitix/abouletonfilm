The twentysomething Lisbon resident has been hailed as the successor to fado legend Am\u00e1lia Rodrigues; now, after two well-received CDs, comes Mariza's first filmed concert performance, and it is stunning. Mariza is backed primarily by acoustic guitar, acoustic bass guitar, and \"Portuguese guitar,\" a 12-string instrument that looks something like a lute and sounds a bit like a Greek bouzouki; there is some piano as well, and Guy Barker's muted trumpet provides \"O Deserto\" with a pronounced jazzy feel. But the singer is the main attraction here, and the power and passion of Mariza's delivery on \"Barco Negro\" and nearly all the others in the 16-song set, including more upbeat, celebratory numbers like \"Oica La o Senhor Vinho\" (the introductions are in English, but the tunes are all in Portuguese) are undeniable.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7zQf8obrF0di5UsIRoUYjNyQmg5.jpg", "actors": ["Mariza (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
