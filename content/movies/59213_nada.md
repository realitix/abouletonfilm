To fulfill her longing for intimacy, she opens random letters and rewrites them into lyrical prose, believing she is helping her fellow Cubans understand one another better. Beautifully filmed in black and white accented by brilliant colours, Nada+ has a stunning visual composition. With its delightful mix of visual humour, theatrical characters, bureaucratic satire and a lighthearted love story, it has a distinctly Cuban flair.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zAV0bTcK5NNqftWaLSEWDwWTjGk.jpg", "actors": ["Thais Vald\u00e9s (Carla P\u00e9rez)", "Nacho Lugo (Cesar)", "Daisy Granados (Cunda)", "Paula Ali (Cuca)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [170925], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
