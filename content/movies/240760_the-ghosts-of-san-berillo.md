It is 1958: while brothels are being shut down all over Italy, San Berillo is razed to the ground and its inhabitants are deported to the suburbs. A piece of the neighborhood, however, remains intact and thousands of prostitutes from all over Italy find shelter there, creating one of the biggest red light districts in the Mediterranean. Until 2000, when a police raid forces the neighborhood's inhabitants to abandon their homes once again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7Me39bAdB5rCdWhmFLei1x6SGz8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
