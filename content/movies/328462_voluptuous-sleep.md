Bromberg\u2019s close-up lens becomes a tool of infinite discovery that reveals as much about our bodily sensations as it does the natural world. Combined with intricate and perfectly matched soundtracks, VOLUPTUOUS SLEEP is a rapturous, re-centering antidote to the fragmentation of modern life and offers a new experience of cinematic time and memory. It is also an emotional tour de force.\u201d \u2013Steve Anker, REDCAT", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
