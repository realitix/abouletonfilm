They will look for their own way of life in the desert, confront their world, looking at the reality that surrounds them. As the author says about her film: \"It talks about Polish women who are going on holiday, and then they break away from the tourist reality and go deep into Morocco. They throw themselves  into a completely wild experience with themselves, with their femininity. The movie is played by women who I found at castings throughout Poland.\"", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Andrzej Chyra ()", "Izabela Kuna ()", "Krzysztof Czeczot  ()", "Jakub Majmurek ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
