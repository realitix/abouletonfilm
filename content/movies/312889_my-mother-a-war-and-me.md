The most personal film to date from co-directors Tamara Trampe and Johann Feindt is dedicated to Tamara's own family history. The search for her unknown father who, as a russian officer, made the young nurse pregnant, is complicated by the fact that her mother has never come to terms with her wartime trauma and worn family photos only seem to show happy-go-lucky life before the war. But the director won't give up so easily and, through a mixture of personal childhood recollections and conversations with relatives and former nurses who were on the front in Ukraine, she puts together the pieces of the puzzle.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6309RxwuNMOiGFgjX7TM3PF2JYr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
