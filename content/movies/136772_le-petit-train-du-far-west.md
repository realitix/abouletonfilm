The plot basically revolves around a group of honest do good folk trying to get the monopoly on the transport rights by getting their train to an appointed destination in Colorado on time. Naturally the bad guy stagecoach owner wants to stop them, thus no threat to his money maker you see, so the good folk led by Kit Dodge Jr (a sort of Virginal Calamity Jane) have to contend with his underhand tricks and of course the peril provided by Indian raids.\r\n\r\nAnne Baxter (Kit) is as cute as a button and most agreeable in the piece, the role is a sort of comedy version of her excellent serious role as Constance Mae 'Mike' in 1948s wonderful Yellow Sky. Joining Anne for this frothy train romp is Dan Dailey, Rory Calhoun and the always watchable Walter Brennan, whilst a mention has to be made that Marilyn Monroe appears in an uncredited role, see if you can spot her? Western purists will no doubt be lifted by the fact that Tonto himself (Chief Thundercloud) also appears, tho it has to be said that he looks rather bemused by it all. 5/10"}], "recommandations_id": [38807]}
