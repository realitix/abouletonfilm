Two Pretoria students, Joerie Anker (Snip) and Christina Burger (Rissiepit), are in love \u2013 to the chagrin of Christina\u2019s better-off parents. Her mother thinks Joerie is not good enough for her daughter and her father, an influential member of the university hierarchy, threatens to have his grant suspended if he doesn't stop seeing his daughter. Parental pressure forces Christina to sever ties with Joerie and she starts seeing the arrogant Piet Stadler. But their relationship is doomed because of Piet\u2019s intense jealousy of Joerie who, he believes, is still the love of Christina\u2019s life. Piet vents his anger on Joerie and Christina when he bumps them off a bridge one night after the two have been out in Joerie\u2019s jalopy. While Christina comes away with light injuries, Joerie has to fight for his life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7RD67joadMKo97EgAGF9sZ0433j.jpg", "actors": ["Rod Alexander (Joerie 'Snip' Anker,)", "Rika Sennett (Christina 'Rissiepit' Burger)", "Pieter Hauptfleisch (Prof. Jacobus Burger)", "Wena Naud\u00e9 (Ouma Burger)", "Nic De Jager (Piet Stadler)", "Christine Stevens (Elize Burger)", "Estelle Zeeman (Mattie)", "Eugene Neethling (Chrisjan)", "Connie Buitendag (Faantjie Burger)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
