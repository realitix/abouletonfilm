In several vignettes, Plympton draws on the essentially comic image of men wearing jackets and ties in a world gone awry. Women, who don't appear all that often, cheerfully participate in the sex and don't hang around for the violence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mdSjjNoqzCiNYA1CTovrVuHwr2J.jpg", "actors": ["Karen Skurka (Women)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
