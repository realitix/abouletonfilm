The father takes to his bed after his hernia acts up and never leaves it. Of his three sons, only one wants to do much about leaving, and he does in fact cross the front threshold of the house with his lover, who is also the maid. However, before he has gotten very far, he is very tired, and goes to sleep where he stands. One of the sons outdoes them all by sleeping literally all the time. He is not in a coma -- he is just very, very lazy and tired. Some critics have viewed this film as a sharply delineated social satire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7Q6vTqX6S488OD6erkVBxICfFyT.jpg", "actors": ["Olga Karlatos (Sofia)", "George Dialegmenos (Sakis)", "Dimitris Poulikakos (Nikos)", "Nikitas Tsakiroglou (Giannis)", "Vasilis Diamantopoulos (Father)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
