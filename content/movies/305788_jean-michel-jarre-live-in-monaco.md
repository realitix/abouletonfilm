Monaco will provide the backdrop for a dazzling evening. The concert was not part of the tour he's doing and distinguishes itself for having totally different visuals and a different setlist, although most of the setlist of the concert did share similarities with the indoor tour.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xgOGLtlNKH254fQ312VXjYBYuHm.jpg", "actors": ["Jean Michel Jarre (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
