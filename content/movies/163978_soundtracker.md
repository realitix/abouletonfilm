Gordon Hempton is an Emmy Award-winning sound recordist who has spent the last 30 years trying to find and record the vanishing sounds of nature in an attempt to capture a disappearing sensory experience. Filmmaker Nick Sherman observes Hempton in the wilderness for 30 days and uncovers an obsessive artist on a quest for perfection in this obscure medium. Hempton\u2019s natural ability to locate and articulate himself through sound has a contagious energy and gives his work a transportive quality. Soundtracker is a fascinating meditation on the world\u2019s changing landscape and the things we may be leaving behind in the service of progress.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3F23ryvSe2k0Ef4RNdkyZUqLjmG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
