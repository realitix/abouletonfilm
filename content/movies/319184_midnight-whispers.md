One evening a gentleman calls in to say that he has been in love with a woman for a very long time \u2013 but that his love seems hopeless \u2013 she has become the mistress of another man for the love of her daughter.  The daughter then calls in to say that the man is lying and that her mother is a terrible woman. Finally, the next day the distraught mother calls in to tell her story. Kung fu diva Moon Lee Choi-fung star in this rare melodramatic turn as Lee Siu-hong, a troubled Mainland Chinese lass who runs away from home to become a Hong Kong prostitute. As her desperate mother (Josephine Koo Mei-wah) scours the colony's pleasure quarters, we see flashbacks of the girl's unfortunate past.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ot5NjN1E4I2CxzhXAJaT3vHgqFK.jpg", "actors": ["Pamela Pak ()", "Moon Lee (Hong)", "Josephine Koo (Hua)", "Prudence Liew Mei-Kwan ()", "Ng Man-Ling ()", "Chui Sau-Lai ()", "Mama Hung (Hua's mother-in-law)", "Ng Hoi-Tin ()", "Patrick Yuen Ho-Chuen ()", "Suen Kwok-Ming ()", "Wong Wai-Hung ()", "Wong Sek-Fan ()", "Kwan Ka-Lai (Waitress)", "Sha Bo ()", "Fong Li ()", "Lui Si-Lan ()", "To Ka-Man ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
