Nikos Nikolaides was an acclaimed film director and author from Greece. He is famous for creating controversial characters in his films that have a rebellious attitude towards the social and political status quo. He illustrates a dark and pessimistic present and future, but providing ambiguous hope for the end when his heroes find their escape in death. His films are shocking and contentious, raising questions during times when political visions start to fade away. His filming was poetic, dynamic and aesthetically beautiful in order to present situations on edge and elicit his audience's feelings. The aim of this project is to transfer his dynamics in a documentary that will convey some of his messages and create a platform for exchanging opinions among filmmakers from all over the world, in an effort to decipher his universe and his symbols as reflections of his unique and rare personality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mFsuscTAmefCN8a9EK1vG08h5Ml.jpg", "actors": ["Giannis Angelakas ()", "Valeria Christodoulidou ()", "Yannis Economides ()", "Vicky Harris ()", "Nikos Nikolaidis ()", "Vera Tschechowa ()", "Eftyhia Yakoumi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
