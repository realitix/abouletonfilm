He's now in trouble with the mob boss, Tom French, who sends Git to Cork with another debtor, Bunny Kelly, to find a guy named Frank Grogan, and take him to a man with a friendly face at a shack across a bog. It's a tougher assignment than it seems: Git's a novice, Bunny's prone to rash acts, Frank doesn't want to be found (and once he's found, he has no money), and maybe Tom's planning to murder Frank, which puts Git in a moral dilemma. Then, there's the long-ago disappearance of Sonny Mulligan. What's a decent and stand-up lad to do?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/na3413fBGD0Hyiy5FOvcWYWbJ7x.jpg", "actors": ["Brendan Gleeson (Bunny Kelly)", "Peter McDonald (Git Hynes)", "Tony Doyle (Tom French)", "Peter Caffrey (Frank Grogan)", "Antoine Byrne (Antoine Byrne)", "David Wilmot (Anto)", "Michael McElhatton (Johnner Doyle)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "vvjMed6Wlug"}
