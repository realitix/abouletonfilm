Orgon takes him into his house, believing him a paragon of virtue. Orgon orders his daughter to reject her fianc\u00e9 and marry Tartuffe. First Dorine, the family servant, tries a strategy to avert the marriage; then Orgon's son tries his hand. They anger Orgon, and to prove paternal power, he disinherits his son and makes Tartuffe his heir. Next Orgon's wife tries to bring her husband insight, a stratagem that partially backfires. With the bailiff at the door ordering Orgon to vacate his own home and with Tartuffe at court to prove Orgon's a traitor, all seems lost.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aSV7vGz62rQO6mQVjwdUAWXX4H.jpg", "actors": ["G\u00e9rard Depardieu (Tartuffe)", "Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier (Orgon)", "Yveline Ailhaud (Dorine)", "Paule Annen (Madame Pernelle)", "Elisabeth Depardieu (Elmire)", "Andr\u00e9 Wilms (Damis)", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Lapiower (Marianne)", "Dominique Ducos (Flipote)", "Paul Bru (Un exempts)", "Noureddine El Ati (Laurent)", "Bernard Freyd (Cleante)", "Jean-Marc Roulot (Val\u00e8re)", "Jean Schmitt (Monsieur Loyal)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
