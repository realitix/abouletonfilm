Popeye immediately sails off to the West, where he finds, who else, Bluto as the head of the ranch where Olive is enthralled. Bluto gives Popeye a wild horse to ride, and, after a few humiliating defeats, Popeye conquers it (and wins back Olive's heart). Bluto punches Popeye out, and into the clutches of what can best be described as a rattlesnake constrictor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hQi1c0zS1BeHx8bFba5MiZho3R0.jpg", "actors": ["Pinto Colvig (Bluto)", "Margie Hines (Olive Oyl)", "Jack Mercer (Popeye)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
