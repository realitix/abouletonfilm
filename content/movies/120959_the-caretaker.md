He befriends and takes in Mac Davies (Donald Pleasence), an old derelict who has been fired from a menial job in a caf\u00e9. In time Aston offers him a job as caretaker of the house. Aston's brother, Mick (Alan Bates) - a taunting, quasi-sadist - harasses the derelict when his brother is away, countermanding his orders.
