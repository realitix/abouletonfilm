A substantial and absorbing mood piece, rich in detail, raw in emotional charge, thought-provoking, gripping and poignant, A Tender Place is nothing short of a masterpiece.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fWJ1YNjGmd8QRGtiAOPTRqxkLPe.jpg", "actors": ["Yuki Amami (Kasumi Moriwake)", "Shunsuke Matsuoka (Jun-ichi Utsumi)", "Tomokazu Miura (Yohei Ishiyama)", "Kumi Nakamura (Noriko Ishiyama)", "Ikkei Watanabe (Michihiro Moriwake)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
