'Group B' machines had taken the world by storm. De-regulation opened the way for the most exciting cars ever to hit the motor sport scene. Nothing like it has ever happened since. 'This is the fastest rallying there has ever been' - Peter Foubister.  For four wild and crazy years manufacturers scrambled to build ever more powerful cars to be driven by fearless mavericks who could handle the extreme power.

This is the story of when fans, ambition, politics and cars collided.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e8kgip2lAa1p2e9lPfgRWe5PHBf.jpg", "actors": ["Denise Cooke (Herself)", "John Davenport (Himself)", "Tony Pond (Himself)", "Jean Todt (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
