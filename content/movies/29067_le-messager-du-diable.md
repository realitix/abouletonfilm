Unfortunately, her wheelchair-bound father (Boris Karloff) is curiously curmudgeonly and something strange is going on behind the scenes. The movie is based on HP Lovecraft\u2019s story \"The Colour Out of Space.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this isn\u2019t a vampire flick, the opening is reminiscent of Dracula (young man visits old man\u2019s eerie chateau). I used to get this mixed up with \u201cThe Terror\u201d (1963), probably because of Karloff, similarities in the plot, and they both came out in the early/mid-60s. Regrettably, \u201cDie, Monster, Die\u201d lacks the haunting fascination of \u201cThe Terror.\u201d It tries to work up a mysterious ambiance, and succeeds to a degree, but the story\u2019s mostly tedious and the characters dull. Susan Farmer is fine, but her part is too secondary and nothing interesting is done with her, like Venetia Stevenson in 1960\u2019s \u201cCity of the Dead,\u201d aka \u201cHorror Hotel\u201d (you know what I mean if you\u2019ve seen that flick).\r\n\r\nThankfully, there are some highlights, like the imaginative scene where the protagonist exclaims \u201cIt looks like a zoo in Hell,\u201d not to mention the impressive monster at the close.\r\n\r\nFYI: Two and a half years after the release of this movie in the US, a demoralized Nick Adams was found dead from an overdose, which might have been accidental, but it also could\u2019ve been suicide.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 15 minutes and was shot in England (Surrey & Berkshire).\r\n\r\nGRADE: C"}], "recommandations_id": [42794, 38120, 3074, 44586]}
