Shot over a year, co-directors Nicolas Lachapelle and Ariel St-Louis Lamoureux follow a group of children through their daily life. A generous and human meditation on identity and place that's unfettered by an issue-driven hook or an imposed narrative, this is the rare sort of film that transcends categorization, becoming a beautiful work of art to behold.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aYbwn5QM9visv6jfmTxc9t2HI8q.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
