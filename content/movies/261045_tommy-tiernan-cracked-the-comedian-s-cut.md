His DVD s sell in their thousands and he is second only to U2 when it comes to live ticket sales with his tours setting box office records wherever he goes. He played a staggering 166 dates at Dublin's 1000 seat, Vicar Street Theatre.  'Cracked The Comedians Cut' is his first official UK release in eight years and shows him at the height of his powers.
