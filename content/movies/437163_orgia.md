A sexual orgy symbolizing the decadance of modern society. Maas, who acts in this film, plays the devil while a wild orgy goes on in his living-room. There is the fantastic drag queen doing her job in the bathroom while frenzied love-making, to the incomparable baroque-jazz music of Tiji Ito, is carried on in Maas's baroque apartment. The camera in bird-swift flight depicts a scene of total decadence as Andy Warhol's Jackie Kennedy careens through the air. By way of explanation: the opening scene shows the director handing out masks to the actors-the same ones used in LSD WALL by John Hawkins. The taking of LSD was part of the original script.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jy5RqAX2E9DouNm8eY2HpVhFikk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
