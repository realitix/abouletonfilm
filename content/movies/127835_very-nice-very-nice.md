It looks behind the business-as-usual face we put on life and shows anxieties we want to forget. It is made of dozens of pictures that seem familiar, with fragments of speech heard in passing and, between times, a voice saying, \"Very nice, very nice.\" It was critically acclaimed and plays frequently in festivals and film schools around the world.
