His \"master\" is a cruel man, imposing a ridiculous behaviour catalogue with strict charges. The children, about 5-10 years of age, have to work all day and they\u00b4re not allowed to go to toilet while at work, let alone visit their parents. Iqbal soon realizes that this is a massive injustice, especially when a member of the (unindentified) country\u00b4s Communist and Anti-child labour party takes photographs of the children.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lou3uDaAMPli5CzfBWm7SpVPyTu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [77956], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
