Shot entirely on black and white film through color filters, the images were recombined into full color through optical printing techniques, one frame at a time. The gestures in this dance work explore the psychological fracturing and reunification in representations of the female body.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xGle3d26N5IoVxqFxwpjAtWzrAC.jpg", "actors": ["Amanda Dawn Christie (Dancer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
