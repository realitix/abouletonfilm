This film captures the original quartet in 1994 playing to a packed and frenzied crowd at the Rat in Boston. The band's workman like approach to their taunt, pummeling sound is contrasted by frontman David Yow's Dionysian revelry as he whips himself and the crowd into an ecstatic mess. This 2 camera shoot catches all the blood, spit and sweat of a truly killer live band at their peak.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qVhP7Ra5k9iZtbii6OE2TQqrdg7.jpg", "actors": ["Duane Denison (Himself)", "Mac McNeilly (Himself)", "David WM.
