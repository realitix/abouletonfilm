Despite his innocence, there is something impish about him \u2013 like a trickster he lures others into his world of covered snares and painted images. As the wild coast of his home village isolates him from commercial entertainment, he invents paper-filmmaking. Rudi meticulously cuts strips of paper, divides them into frames and paints every picture. He has built a small-scale projector and moves the strip by hand in his own unique rhythm, providing score, soundtrack and dialogue live \u2013 with an energy bordering on the obsessed.  His favorites are horror movies: \u201cLove stories are not my cup of tea!\u201d he explains to the parish priest, his audience. The priest strives to lead the boy to the path of faith and professionalism: he commissions a feature film to be screened at Sunday mass. And Rudi delivers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eK9owEMzaDIEdQCavs6Zo9e2UnD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
