Ayano, the wife, who works for a boutique company, insists her husband is involved with another woman. Supported by her employer Kotomi Saegusa, the company president, she demands a divorce as soon as possible. On the other hand, her husband Tetsuo, a trading professional, denies having a relationship with a woman. He says he will not agree to the divorce and does not plan to let his only son Kenta go, so the arbitration continues. According to Akira's investigation, Ayano gave birth to Kenta as a single mother five years ago when she was working as a hospital clerk, making him Tetsuo's stepson. Tetsuo loves Kenta as his own child, so Akira doesn't understand why Ayano is so insistent on getting a divorce. However, Tetsuo's insistence on not giving up custody of his stepson Kenta is also very unusual.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["K\u00f4tar\u00f4 Koizumi (Akira Yamanobo)", "Toshinori Omi (Katsuya Endo)", "Hisahiro Ogura (Makoto Ashida)", "Maki Miyamoto (Ayano Katase)", "Shingo Katsurayama (Tetsuo Katase)", "Hitoe Ohtake (Azusa Katsumata)", "Takeyuki Yue (Yukihiko Isomura)", "Megumi Matsushita (Yukari Naito)", "Y\u016brei Yanagi (Takanori Fujinami)", "Aiko Sato (Kotomi Saegusa)", "Karin Yamaguchi (Yayoi Ohgawara)", "Miwako Shishido (Saeko Takeyama)", "Wataru Kuriyama (Shosuke Ikegami)", "Natsuo (Erika Sakuma)", "Keiko Horiuchi (Miyako Yamanobo)", "Michiko Kawai (Kozue Sugimura)", "Bibari Maeda (Mitsuko Yamanobo)", "Renji Ishibashi (Kenichi Yamanobo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
