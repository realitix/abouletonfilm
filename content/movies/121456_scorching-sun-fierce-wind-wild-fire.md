Into this anarchy rides a masked feminine Zorro, nom de guerre Violet, to do battle, right wrongs and foment rebellion against the most corrupt and brutal warlord of all, Tung Ta-Chou. Unbeknownst to Tung, however, Violet is his own daughter. Tung orders his psycho enforcer Master Wu to track down and dispose of this pesky rebel queen. Meanwhile, Violet begins a flirtation with an attractive stranger who comes to town with the other half of a treasure map held by Tung. Ultimately, Master Wu betrays the warlord on the lure of the complete treasure map, enabling Violet and the stranger to apprehend Master Wu and beat the warlord at his own game.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pcGfGtZAqZOU7Pn2jWajF2suxMz.jpg", "actors": ["Angela Mao (Violet)", "Tsui Fu-Sheng (Warlord Tung Ta-chou)", "Lo Lieh (Escaped Convict #2)", "Dorian Tan Tao-Liang (Escaped Convict #1)", "Tien Peng (The Stranger)", "Chang Yi (Master Wu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
