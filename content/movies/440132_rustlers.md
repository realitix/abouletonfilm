She\u2019s not the only one interested in him: her sociologist father Roberto Carri wrote a book on him called \u201cPre-Revolutionary Forms of Violence\u201d and a film was made about his story, although both father and film disappeared during the Dirty War. Legends, families, political alignments, cinema: none offer a stable foothold and Carri\u2019s passage through them is like wandering a garden of forking paths, only to arrive at a landscape of cracked earth and thorns.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kdcXjq8KsfuCizmfi1GVS2jwrYd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
