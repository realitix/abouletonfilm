He has a girlfriend, but she is getting frustrated at his repeatedly missing their dates and spending more time with his experiments than with her. One day, Prof. Crawford makes an incredible discovery a form of rubber that defies gravity with each bounce, which he names Flubber. Hopefully, with this invention Crawford can prove to his love that he's not just a hopeless loser stuck doing dead-end research.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["David Paymer (Mr. Oliphant)", "Harry Anderson (Prof. Henry Crawford)", "Bibi Osterwald (Mrs. Nakamura)", "Thomas Callaway (Prof. Donald (as Tom Callaway))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
