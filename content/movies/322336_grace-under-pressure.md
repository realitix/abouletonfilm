Disaffected and drifting aimlessly through life, she is the black sheep of an otherwise spectacularly successful family she has taken great pains to distance herself from. When Grace gets invited to a reunion she can't get out of, she turns to her friend Laila for guidance. Laila has much more than supportive words and a shoulder to cry on for her wayward friend and a startling revelation could be just the thing for Grace to finally turn the tables on her condescending relatives. A female centric comedy with supernatural elements, Grace Under Pressure explores the perception of women and success.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
