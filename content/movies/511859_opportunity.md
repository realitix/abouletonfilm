Rachit is an urbane guy and Shikhar has a 'small-town' rustic charm - the differences between them are evident during their interactions. But as the evening progresses, Rachit recollects some forgotten memories from a distant past. Together, they revisit the roads not taken; and, the lines between the past and the present get blurred. Set in Mumbai, India, this romantic drama is a contemporary take on the life and relationships of a single professional gay man - his understanding of his identity, missed opportunities, and personal choices.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/haKOFsA61qOsQEKRyePrl5a2ey.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
