After 16 years in Brooklyn, working three low-paying jobs and collecting bottles on the street in his spare time and sending the bulk of his earnings home to his family in Mexico, he's decided to return to his wife and the children he hasn't seen in almost two decades. But when he informs his family of his homecoming, he discovers that they've squandered the money, are deeply in debt and don't want him to return. They need him to stay in the US, continuing to earn. Shot over two years in the heart of Brooklyn's immigrant community, \"I'm Leaving Now\" is a searingly intimate portrait of one undocumented worker on the margins.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k3sGA9BMQljjJuyvhELkM12tjUB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
