The person behind the said page, Mona happens to be missing. Her friend, and a fellow student, Sarah recruits the help of a classmate, Wiki - a borderline sociopathic genius. This odd-couple of amateur sleuths carry on their investigation as the story leads them into unexpected corners and terrifying revelations. It's a pacy thriller, confined to limited locations on one single campus, populated by fresh, sexy, young characters that can be executed on a fairly shoestring budget. More importantly it captures the present zeitgeist of young India and its obsession with social networking.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f7NhXgX6PbbRs3wExlop8p5VpIM.jpg", "actors": ["Anushman Jha (Wiki)", "Divya Menon (Sarah)", "Suzanna Mukherjee (Mona)", "Sanjay Suri (Dean)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
