When famed composer Lluis Doria (Laurent Terzieff) visits a transvestite club, he learns his lifelong friend Albert Rossell (Serge Reggiani) is the house pianist. A flashback takes the tale four decades into the past where the younger Rossell (Pere Ponce) rejoins Teresa (Paulina Galvez) after having spent years in prison for helping anti-Franco anarchists. The story continues into Paris of the '30s, the period when Doria and Rossell first met, sharing a mutual interest in music and Teresa, before civil war sent them in different directions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3ZLo0rib2nM6a68twn5IafhqUQU.jpg", "actors": ["Jordi Moll\u00e0 ()", "Pere Ponce ()", "Paulina G\u00e1lvez ()", "Merc\u00e8 Ar\u00e0nega ()", "Marc Mart\u00ednez ()", "Francesc Orella ()", "Vicky Pe\u00f1a ()", "Michel Robin ()", "Serge Reggiani ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
