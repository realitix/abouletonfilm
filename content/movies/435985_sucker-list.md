The scheme has two main components: they print and circulate a list of horse racing winners making it look like they've predicted the winners, and they, with a list of bank loan applicants in hand, telephone these people telling them of a sure bet. Seeing after the fact in the racing forms that the sure bet did in fact win the races, these loan applicants, desperate for money, will then go to the Best Selections office to make a subsequent bet through their bookies, who in reality are fakes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jDkD3uGkbvKCKCKH2dXlNN4Oihc.jpg", "actors": ["Lynne Carver (Mary Allen)", "Noel Madison (Mr. Brown)", "John Archer (William Allen)", "George Cleveland (Old Man)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
