And now - as Aunt Alma is slowly getting rid of the concern for her beloved nephew - Dr. Kr\u00f6pelin finally got his chance: he makes a marriage proposal to Alma. She would not be averse if it had not been his \"bloodthirsty\" hobby, the hunt. A get-together on the high seat is still not a desirable prospect for Alma. But the more she refuses, the tighter Kr\u00f6pelin bites into his intention to marry her anyway, whatever the cost.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fTwT55jIlaT6HMw4JvymqixAjqu.jpg", "actors": ["Agnes Kraus (Alma Krause)", "Fred Mahr (Dr. Otto Kr\u00f6pelin)", "Fred Delmare (Krischan Hahnemann)", "Karin Boyd (Angela Keto)", "Wolfgang Penz (Heinz Rascher)", "Marta Ra\u0161lov\u00e1 (Jana Novak)", "Anne Wollner (Erna Hahnemann)", "Birgit Edenharter (Rosi Schr\u00f6der)", "Otmar Richter (Krummbein)", "Werner R\u00f6wekamp (Arzt)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
