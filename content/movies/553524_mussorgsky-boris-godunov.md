Adapting Pushkin's epic poem, Mussorgsky composed a meditation on the solitude of power, a populist drama in which the real protagonist is the Russian people with its burden of eternal suffering. Ivo Van Hove is no stranger to grand political frescos. This is his first production for the Paris Opera.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a9hJ3s5cZutiF5C0UVfkUFsMruT.jpg", "actors": ["Ildar Abdrazakov (Boris Godunov)", "Evdokia Malevskaya (Feodor)", "Ruzan Mantashyan (Xenia)", "Alexandra Durseneva (Xenia's nurse)", "Maxim Paster (Prince Vasiliy Ivanovich Shuysky)", "Boris Pinkhasovich (Andrey Shchelkalov)", "Vladimir Jurowski (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
