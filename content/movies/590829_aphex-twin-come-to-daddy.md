The dog urinates on an abandoned television lying on the pavement, causing it to sputter unexpectedly into life, and a distorted and warping headshot of Richard D. James chants the lyrics. This unleashes a spirit, accompanied by a gang of small children, all of whom bear James' grinning face and who appear to inhabit the abandoned buildings. The children go around wreaking havoc, trashing an alley and chasing a man into his car. The thin man emerges from the television, screams in the woman's face, then gathers the children around him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zl1MrrEQPAUFq4AT2A9CHLwK8aM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
