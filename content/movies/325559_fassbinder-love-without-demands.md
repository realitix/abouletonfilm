His swift and dramatic demise at the early age of 37 in 1982 left behind a vacuum in European filmmaking that has yet to be filled, as well as a body of unique, multi-layered and multifarious work of astonishing consistency and rigour. From 1969 onwards, Danish director and film historian Christian Braad Thomsen maintained a close yet respectfully distanced friendship with Fassbinder. Fassbinder \u2013 Lieben ohne zu fordern is based on his personal memories as well as a series of conversations and interviews he held with Fassbinder and his mother Lilo in the 1970s.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4VYN8NXaGYa5nquRZWbBghyIPtE.jpg", "actors": ["Rainer Werner Fassbinder ()", "Irm Hermann ()", "Harry Baer ()", "Andrea Schober ()", "Lilo Pempeit ()", "Margit Carstensen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [148822, 162394, 149937, 264482], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
