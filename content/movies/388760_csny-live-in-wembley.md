As the band had an \" on ,off \" reputation , nobody knew just how long the reunion would actually last (the group would disband again for some time after this 1974 stint ) so the impetus was there to attend if you were any sort of fan .", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/686xuoLMfrjGV282BuFcljcsIUU.jpg", "actors": ["David Crosby (Himself)", "Stephen Stills (Himself)", "Graham Nash (Himself)", "Neil Young (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
