It is aimed at businesses that require display freezers for their products. The narrator makes points of the promoted freezer cabinet to utilize efficient design in space saving, modernized refrigeration methods, and attractive presentation of products stored in the freezer. The title comes from a spokeswoman next to the freezer who is dressed as a wizard with a wand and in revealing clothes who does not talk but motions with the narration.
