Once more, Brown plays a government man, sent to the badlands to round up an elusive outlaw gang. And once more, he is aided and abetted by Raymond Hatton, an old codger who has a lot more on the ball than people suspect. Director Lambert Hillyer keeps things moving even when nothing much is happening. Though it usually adheres to The Expected, Frontier Agent has a few offbeat touches, just to keep the non-western fans awake.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o88dPOa1EKI6iqokuouz8Oo4YfL.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Mack Brown (Johnny Mack Brown)", "Raymond Hatton (Cappy)", "Reno Browne (Sandra Kerrigan (as Reno Blair))", "Kenneth MacDonald (Burton Wheelock)", "Dennis Moore (Larry Foster)", "Riley Hill (Joe Farr)", "Frank LaRue (Dell Carson)", "Ted Adams (Jim Kerrigan)", "Virginia Carroll (Paula - Carson's Secretary)", "William Ruhl (The Marshal (as Wm.
