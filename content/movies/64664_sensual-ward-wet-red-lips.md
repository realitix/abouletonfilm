A young couple enter a hospital after rumours that a demonic spirit known as the slit mouthed woman had been seen there. Once inside, they are possessed by an overwhelming desire to have sex and sneak off into an empty room to satiate their lusts. Then out of the darkness a perverse and disfigured woman appears and confronts them.The Slit-Mouthed Woman, a.k.a Kuchisake, is an original hybrid of pink erotica and horror from the controversial J-sploitation director Takuaki Hashiguchi whose previous films include the disturbingly nasty Woman Prisoner Torture. The Slit-Mouthed Woman features impressive special make-up effects from Takashi Oda, who worked alongside the acclaimed actor/director Beat Takeshi Kitano on his Yakuza action film Sonatine.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gnvNtDqNqcgbxuBSSujhm6kvhnu.jpg", "actors": ["Minami Aoyama ()", "Mayu Asada ()", "Lemon Hanazawa ()", "Hotaru Hazuki ()", "Kikujir\u00f4 Honda ()", "Ky\u00f4ko Kazama ()", "Azusa Sakai ()", "Mikiya Sanada ()", "Mikio Sat\u00f4 ()", "Taishi Takemoto ()", "Sh\u00fbji \u00d4tsuki ()", "Takeshi It\u00f4 ()", "T\u00f4ru Morinaga ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
