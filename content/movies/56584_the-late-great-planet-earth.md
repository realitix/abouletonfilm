Carlson, and first published by Zondervan. The book was adapted in 1979 into a movie. The Late, Great Planet Earth is a treatment of literalist, premillennial, dispensational eschatology. As such, it compared end-time prophecies in the Bible with then-current events in an attempt to broadly predict future scenarios leading to the rapture of believers before the tribulation and Second Coming of Christ to establish his thousand-year (i.e. millennial) Kingdom on Earth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xqHt4IQcH3caAiKbcImyCldu6gk.jpg", "actors": ["Orson Welles (Himself)", "Judith Roberts (Whore of Babylon)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "5fcnQ2dN1iI"}
