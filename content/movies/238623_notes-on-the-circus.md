The film is separated into four segments, each segment which focuses on different acts within the circus. The later segments often incorporate clips from earlier segments, mostly as background to the featured acts. The speed of the clips match the tempo of the soundtrack music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kvEhxB2kVUgoNm1LTastVr8EpTh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [294104, 113989, 162751], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
