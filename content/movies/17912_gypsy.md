The teleplay by Arthur Laurents is an adaptation of his book of the 1959 stage musical Gypsy, which was based on Gypsy: A Memoir by Gypsy Rose Lee.\r Gypsy Rose Lee's son, Erik Lee Preminger, was instrumental in getting the film in production and was the main source for research. He had tried to get the musical filmed 10 years earlier with Bette Midler the principal role, but it required the approval of five entities to obtain the rights. One of the obstacles had been Arthur Laurents himself, who wrote the book for the musical based on Lee's memoirs. He had hated the 1962 film version and was initially opposed to a remake. \"Not for all the money in the world will we let them make another film version of Gypsy,\" he had said.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yhbahFcDTj2TA51gurqo2w2G49c.jpg", "actors": ["Bette Midler (Mama Rose)", "Peter Riegert (Herbie)", "Cynthia Gibb (Louise/Gypsy Lee Rose)", "Ed Asner (Pop)", "Christine Ebersole (Tessie Tura)", "Michael Jeter (Mr. Goldstone)", "Andrea Martin (Miss Cratchitt)", "Linda Hart (Miss Mazeppa)", "Anna McNeely (Miss Electra)", "Jennifer Rae Beck (June (adult))", "Jeffrey Broadhurst (Tulsa)", "Tony Shalhoub (Uncle Jocko)", "Rachel Sweet (Agnes)", "Lacey Chabert (Baby June)", "Elisabeth Moss (Baby Louise)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [57868, 24054], "youtube_key": "PSiONCpcfkk"}
