It took seven turbulent years that tested the limits of their friendship and nearly burned down their mother's house. By the end, they had completed every scene except one... the explosive airplane scene. 30 years later, they attempt to finally realize their childhood dream by building a replica of the 75 foot \"Flying Wing\" plane from Raiders in a mud pit in the backwoods of Mississippi... and then blow it up! This is the story behind the making of what is known as \"the greatest fan film ever made.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6qH6ZkqIPtMvETKSaWNnRNLV6Te.jpg", "actors": ["John Rhys-Davies (Himself)", "Eli Roth (Himself)", "Eric Zala (Himself)", "Chris Strompolos (Himself)", "Jayson Lamb (Himself)", "Angela Rodriguez (Herself)", "Mark Spain (Himself)", "Guy Klender (Himself)", "Harry Jay Knowles (Himself)", "Ernest Cline (Himself)", "Tim League (Himself)", "Francisco Gonzales ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [302502, 362610, 343304, 312152], "youtube_key": "0TNq9BQZi8o"}
