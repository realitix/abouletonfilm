With this year\u2019s SSS16 tournament coming up next week, it\u2019s time to go back and do a #BACKFILL for last year\u2019s two-day tournament\u2026  This was the spiritual follow-up to 2014\u2019s World Cup show, which worked well because the football World Cup took place at around that time as well. Entrants into the inaugural tournament included the likes of Will Ospreay, Mark Haskins, Marty Scurll and Zack Sabre Jr, with fly-ins limited to Tommaso Ciampa and Roderick Strong.  The show opened with a montage of fans saying who they thought would win, before the pre-show amble featured the return of Kris Travis to say a few words to the Camden faithful.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
