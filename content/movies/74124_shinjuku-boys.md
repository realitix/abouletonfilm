This documentary is set in the New Marilyn night club in Tokyo, Japan - where the hosts are women who have chosen to live as men. They can only make their living as hosts in a nightclub with other 'wannabes' like them. The young women who come there often have relationships with them but the underlying fear is whether such a relationship can withstand the pressures on a girl to get married and have children. All three boys deal with this in different ways. These three hosts, the Shinjuku Boys, take us into their lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rg6m4juHbGSu92undjYnCwQzvxM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
