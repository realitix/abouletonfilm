Throughout history, Kabbalah was studied by only the most holy Talmud scholars. The misinformation, innuendo and prohibition surrounding Kabbalah kept its wisdom from most Jews; many were even unaware of its existence.  In 'Kabbalah Me', director Steven Bram embarks on a spiritual investigation that leads him to reunite with the Hasidic branch of his family and connect to the community of Judaic scholarship. Eventually his curiosity takes him on a pilgrimage to Israel, where he immerses himself in history and traditions of the Holy Land.  Along the way, leading authorities discuss the complex, mystical world of Kabbalah its varying interpretations and the myriad paths of its rituals and lessons. Bram's new commitment to spirituality and religious observance draws skepticism from family and friends but ultimately leads to profound changes across all aspects of his life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6a6IPtIviISkg8bAJpE7Xbfb7bc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
