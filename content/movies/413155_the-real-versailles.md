They reveal the colourful world of sex, drama and intrigue that Louis XIV and his courtiers inhabited.  Lucy untangles Louis's complex world of court etiquette, fashion and feasting, while Helen delves into the archives and unpicks the Machiavellian world of court politics that Louis created. We meet the people behind the on-screen characters and discover what drove Louis to glorify his reign on a scale unmatched by any previous monarch, examine the tension between Louis and his brother Philippe, a battle hero and overt homosexual, and they meet the coterie of women who competed for Louis's attention.  We see that Louis was ruthless in his pursuit of glory and succeeded in defeating his enemies. In his record-breaking 72-year reign, France became renowned for its culture and sophistication.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wvDsz3lISwYh57jjYxnZkvzPjDj.jpg", "actors": ["Lucy Worsley (Presenter)", "Helen Castor (Presenter)", "James Daybell (Participant)", "Mark Wallis (Participant)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
