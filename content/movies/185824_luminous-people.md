They are running against the wind, anticipating a farewell. In the middle of the river, the lady head of the family casts the ashes off into the stream. The white dust merges with the muddy water. The boat makes a u-turn at the bridge that links two countries. The passengers are tired and start to drift off into their own world. The film disintegrates. The crew and the cast wander off in the river of simulation. The border links the worlds of the dead and of the living. The memory of an anonymous dead father lingers. The boat still moves on as the dusk arrives.  Apichatpong and his crew traveled to Nong Khai, a small town near Mekong River, and recruited local villagers to participate in the project.  For two days, the crew and cast reconstructed a fake ceremony and find a narrative.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eDHnCWs4LhLzhlC2gmsixIuguKQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
