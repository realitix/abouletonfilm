Everything and anything that hasn't been nailed to the spot winds up in her possession - whether it's a wallet belonging to a passer-by or a Jeep. But the police are on to her and the streets of Riga are becoming just a little too dangerous for Margita these days (played by rising Latvian star Rezija Kalninca). She decides to break camp and hitchhike her way up north coming to rest at a little place called Vineeri in Estonia, where she soon finds herself looking after an entire household, including three men and a small boy.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Lembit Ulfsak (Adolf)", "T\u00f5nu Kark (Dr. Lepik)", "Rezija Kalnina (Margita)", "Tiit Sukk (Arnold)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
