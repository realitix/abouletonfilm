With the proliferation of TV channels, documentaries are enjoying an unprecedented boom fuelled by audiences seeking an alternative to infotainment. But now documentary filmmaking, too, finds itself constrained by the imperatives of television. However, there is a rebel resisting this uniformity of the spirit. Pre-eminent among today's documentary filmmakers concerned about this mind-numbing standardization, Peter Watkins has never strayed from either his principles or the cause.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oVEDpx7HtNTp5JwuDuv9lc5Dlhz.jpg", "actors": ["R.
