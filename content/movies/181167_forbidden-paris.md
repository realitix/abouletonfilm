The film jumps from one strange scenario to the next, including a woman who goes publicly nude on a bet, a family man wearing an anti-radiation suit in fear of the end of the world, a orgy-indulging cult with a kissing fetish, a role-reversal wedding of performing transvestites, a middle-aged man who gives striptease lessons to housewives, a self-absorbed loner who believes he\u2019s a vampire, a ritualistic funeral procession involving the burning of a mannequin, a mass swimming pool baptism, etc.  Probably the most fascinatingly grotesque bit, which at the same time is strangely touching, is when a woman has her beloved deceased medium sized dog stuffed by a pipe-smoking taxidermist (shown in graphic detail) and installed with an electronic barking device!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uVTDEZvrNLPUmD6qdX8asfYgTiT.jpg", "actors": ["Ben-Ghou-Bey (Himself)", "Gene Fenn (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
