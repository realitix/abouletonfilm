Entitled The Open Road, his remarkable travelogue was conceived as a series of shorts, 26 episodes in all, to be shown weekly at the cinema.  The result is a fascinating portrait of inter-war Britain, in which town and country, people and landscapes are captured as never before, in a truly unique and rich colour palette.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dasc3BvsiqwqmX4DsA4W5qzgE1B.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
