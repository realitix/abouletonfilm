The motel's guests are only concerned for themselves until a poor man and his wife drive up to the motel, unable to go any further. Out of rooms, Nick's wife prepares a place for them in a shed under a neon star Nick had just finished hanging. Their plight brings out the generosity in everyone, including Nick, who remembers another family almost two thousand years earlier that also found a makeshift room at an inn under another kind of star.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jqoSb6y0FSXFfFEHMlDBWA8HvBC.jpg", "actors": ["J.
