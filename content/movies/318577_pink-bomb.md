Waise Lee is the tour guide, a loopy priest who\u2019s preoccupied with changing money. Sean Lau does a Travis Bickle impression as a jaded taxi driver who\u2019s sweet on teacher Rachel Lee.

Dayo Wong is a wacky ex-triad.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tVrIRJvNXubSRW5DhopYAnQsrlj.jpg", "actors": ["Cynthia Khan ()", "Waise Lee ()", "Loletta Lee ()", "Lau Ching Wan ()", "Dayo Wong ()", "Cheung Kwok-Leung ()", "Fung Hak-On ()", "Gloria Yip ()", "Helen Poon Bing-Seung ()", "Baby Bo Pui-Yu ()", "Ken Lok Tat-Wah ()", "Lau Siu-Gwan ()", "Ma On ()", "Garry Chan Chi-Shing ()", "Jack Wong Wai-Leung ()", "Ling Lai-Man ()", "Sung Boon-Chung ()", "Leung Kai-Chi ()", "William Chu Wai-Lim ()", "Hui Si-Man ()", "San Tak-Kan ()", "Ah Sing ()", "Fennie Yuen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
