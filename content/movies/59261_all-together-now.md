Though George Harrison passed away before development began, band members Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr; along with Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison; pushed the vision forward. Using archival materials, interviews, and footage of the rehearsals and performances that chart the creative process, All Together Now charts the story of this bold collaboration and the resulting live show. This GRAMMY\u00ae Award-winning film takes you from the studio, as musical directors George and Giles Martin reshaped The Beatles' original masters into an original, vibrant soundscape, to the historic opening night in Las Vegas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zIyFGdGOIFQmgWRzwvo3kyCeR8y.jpg", "actors": ["Guy Lalibert\u00e9 (Himself)", "Paul McCartney (Himself)", "Ringo Starr (Himself)", "George Martin (Himself)", "Neil Aspinall (Himself)", "Giles Martin (Himself)", "Dominic Champagne (Himself)", "David Giammarco (Himself)", "Olivia Harrison (Herself)", "Dhani Harrison (Himself)", "Yoko Ono (Herself)", "Rodrigue Proteau (Himself)", "Bobby Baldwin (Himself)", "Jonathan Clyde (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "bWmYQPS21yE"}
