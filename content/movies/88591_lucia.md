The three episodes also present us with \"Luc\u00edas\" of different social classes. Sol\u00e1s described his film in this way: \"The woman's role always lays bare the contradictions of a period and makes them explicit: Luc\u00eda is not a film about women, it's a film about society.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/teTrhZx0t9Oa7g3j1dcn5bWUDyj.jpg", "actors": ["Raquel Revuelta ()", "Eslinda N\u00fa\u00f1ez ()", "Adela Legr\u00e1 ()", "Eduardo Moure ()", "Ram\u00f3n Brito ()", "Adolfo Llaurad\u00f3 ()", "Idalia Anreus ()", "Silvia Planas ()", "Flora Lauten ()", "Rogelio Blain ()", "Maria Elena Molinet ()", "Aram\u00eds Delgado ()", "Tet\u00e9 Vergara ()", "Flavio Calder\u00edn ()", "Nelson Rodr\u00edguez ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [97030, 97032, 86303, 85834], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
