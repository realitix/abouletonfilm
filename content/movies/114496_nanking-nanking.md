Featuring Richie Jen, Gigi Leung, Aarif Lee (Echoes of the Rainbow), idol-drama queen Joe Chen, and Under the Hawthorn Tree new stars Shawn Dou and Zhou Dongyu, the poignantly romantic melodrama consists of a trilogy of standalone tales about life, dreams, and the often futile pursuit of happiness.
