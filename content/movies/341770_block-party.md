Two vinyl records are turning on a turntable. On the one hand the soundtrack is heard of three decades ago, on the other the voices of musicians today. The turntable is mounted at the foot of a block in the Bronx. It is the end of a Block Party, a ghetto party centring on hip-hop. In the same image those artists are brought together who stood at the cradle of this musical genre.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
