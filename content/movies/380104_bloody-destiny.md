Not much is known from the plot, but considering its poster is reminiscent of old-school Shaw Bros. and Golden Harvest flicks (it even features a guy dressed up in Bruce Lee\u2019s famous yellow/black tracksuit from Game of Death), the movie definitely stands out as something to look out for.\r\n\r\nZang Xichuan directs with Gu Shang Wei leading a cast consisting of Haitao Du, Yun-su Choi, Feng Xinyao, Feng Gang and Ka-Yan Leung."}], "recommandations_id": []}
