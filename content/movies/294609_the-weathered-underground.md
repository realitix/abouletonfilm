Eric is a struggling musician who works a side job and just broke up with the greatest love of his life, the somewhat insane yet adorable Liz (Brea Grant, Heroes, H2). Now you, the viewer, must guide Eric through one insane evening with Criminals, Drugs and Damsels while deciding whether Eric will win back the love of his life or crumble into Moral Decay... His fate is now in your hands... The Weathered Underground allows the viewer via remote control or mouse (online) to control the story ultimately choosing a story of redemption or debauchery. Featuring over 30 different endings and 1,000 choices. The film can be played/viewed for up to four hours, over and over without getting the same plot line!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3e8vlbDSPrlxf4WUSrSlH07qY8U.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Ciriaco (Eric Simmons)", "Brea Grant (Liz)", "Hollis McLachlan (Rene)", "David N.
