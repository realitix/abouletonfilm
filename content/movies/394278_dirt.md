From the slums of Kolkata to Vancouver's Downtown Eastside to a barbeque joint in Central Texas, Dirt digs deep into the webs of meaning and feeling attached to that deceptively simple 4-letter word. An odyssey into all things unclean, the film features animation to make Hieronymus Bosch blush and music from Godspeed You! Black Emperor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iTkq9FkHyUH6wh65FqOwNEjwKE2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
