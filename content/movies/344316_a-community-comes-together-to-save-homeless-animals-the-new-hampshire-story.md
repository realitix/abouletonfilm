By 2000, New Hampshire had become the first state in the nation to stop putting cats and dogs to death in its shelters just to make room for other animals who had become homeless. Bill made this film to get a better understanding of how that happened. It includes interviews with people who helped make that progress and shows how people throughout the country can do the same in their own community.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
