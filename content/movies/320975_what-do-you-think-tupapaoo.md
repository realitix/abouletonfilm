Murnau had wanted to use the decor of a real cemetery. The Tahitians\r refused, because of the phosphorescence at night in the swamps. But Murnau shot in this\r location all the same. The natives said it was a sacrilege. Returning to Hollywood to edit his\r film there, he was driving a car along the beach. He missed a turn, and killed himself. It\u2019s\r claimed that it was because he had violated the sacred cemetery. For our film, we wrote the\r similar story of a man who doesn\u2019t respect the Tahitian cemeteries, and who dies.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xp4FT97S3wsSM3KZKPseXuloL13.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
