In spite of the danger involved, her determination to help is strengthened when one of her young students is killed in a Japanese air raid. Some time later, she is part of a group of Allied representatives departing from Lashio, on a bus traveling the Burma Road back to China. A bridge outage forces them to spend the night in a monastery along the way, and during the night they watch in horror as a supply convoy of trucks is bombed by Japanese planes. The timing and accuracy of the raid brings them to realize that either one of their group, or perhaps the priest in the monastery, is really an enemy agent", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3v5t7Uph7jp8C3VD2kLtP051PTy.jpg", "actors": ["Anna May Wong (Lin Ying)", "Noel Madison (Me-Hoi)", "Leslie Denison (Sir Roger Howe)", "Nedrick Young (Slim Jenkins)", "Dan Seymour (Pete Bragranza)", "Frank Lackteen (Hallam)", "Judith Gibson (Lucy Dell)", "Dennis Moore (Tom Whitley)", "Connie Leon (Ma Sing)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
