The contrasts in this multi-image piece -- shifts between frenetic chaos and calm order, between an intense central focus and a diffuse periphery, between hard and soft, fixed and fluid, concrete and abstract -- are all developed not in opposition to each other but rather, in an interwoven, multilayered relation to each other. There is never one set of oppositions but rather a dance of relationships between contrasting states. This is one way to think about how a mind works: at any moment, there is never just one thing (or feeling, or perception) in life; there is always a magnetized and elastic push/pull among many things at once. The flow of our attention among these things is our mind. Number One is one way to map a few moments in such a mind.  Number One is a single channel evolution of the 6 channel video installation Convection.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/krAkoHFqKPQ5WgDj5QOKRcgcRBS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
