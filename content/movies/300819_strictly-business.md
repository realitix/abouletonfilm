There's Val (enticing Sharon Kane) a secretary who has aspirations of becoming partners with her boss Larry (Robert Bullock) by taking his dick-tation and indulging in three way confrontation with Larry and the client's daughter Monica (insatiable Krysta Lane). When Larry reneges on the deal, Sharon blueballs him by showing the client a video with Larry making it with Monica. Out of a job, Larry lands another by being seduced by the hard-boiled and hard-up agency head Cynthia (Nina Hartley). But he gets on top (literally and figuratively) when he has his seduction video taped and shown to her boss! Obliviously, everybody gets it in the end and comes out smiling.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rxH0gNXSCytdwRXbFP2QqGVXT35.jpg", "actors": ["Sharon Kane ()", "Robert Bullock (Larry)", "Krista Lane ()", "Shanna McCullough ()", "Billy Dee ()", "Lacey Logan ()", "Randy West ()", "Scott Irish ()", "Nina Hartley ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
