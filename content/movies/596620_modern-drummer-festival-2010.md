Hudson Music was there to capture this historic event as the world\u2019s premier drum festival returned to the venue where it all began.  The lineup for the 2010 Festival featured world-class drumming artists of all styles: the aggressively complex attack of progressive star Chris Pennie (Coheed & Cambria, Dillinger Escape Plan), a stylistically diverse set from Nashville session master Shannon Forrest, the unstoppable groove of Shawn Pelton and his band House of Diablo, the cutting-edge stylings of breakbeat/jam-band/jazz master Adam Deitch, the amazing creativity of international drum star Benny Greb, and the classic funk of New Orleans master Stanton Moore and his trio.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m3yELO5E8G8sePO0G8fFsWmwHV1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
