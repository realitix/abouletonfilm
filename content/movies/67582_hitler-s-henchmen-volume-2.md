These well researched documentaries from German TV should give us the last word on one of the darkest periods of the 20th Century. Presented by Guido Knopp the TV series looks at Hitler's right hand men who would do his dirty work for him from Himmler, Goebbels, Hess and Goring and even Hitler's architect Speer, evil men all who under Hitler let their evil side take full reign of their lives.
