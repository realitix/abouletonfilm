With its sunkissed opening shots and bouncy score, the film starts off like one big ole\u2019 romantic comedy clich\u00e9. The tropes are decidedly familiar\u2014young love, attractive couple, an idyllic picnic on the grass. This is the stuff that Hollywood has told us is true\u2014the saccharine syrup that has made up the montages of many a Katherine Heigl movie. Then, reality sets in. Our protagonist isn\u2019t some stock dream boy. Rather, he\u2019s a guy coming to terms with himself and his sexuality. And, in that exploration, he leaves a lot of confused and hurt partners (of both genders) in his wake.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dtIEiSYFHFVGyMASFhpvdQxxe7i.jpg", "actors": ["Emily Davenport (Annie)", "Jake Sturdevant (Drew)", "Zack Tennant (Nate)", "Vanessa Wolf (Cammy)", "Brian Dare ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
