Not yet even properly in a relationship, they discover that they are expecting a baby, and decide to keep it \u2013 partly as a statement to their families who have lost touch with what goes on in the teenagers\u2019 lives. Lenni then has nine months to become a man. Having grown up without a father figure, Lenni receives some yearned for adult attention from an unlikely friend; 40-year old Janne, a member of a right wing activist group. After taking part in a scrambled attack on a local Mosque, while Kiira is rushed to the hospital to give birth, Lenni realises that he can be a man in his own way, even if he never had a chance to be a child himself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pn3J0siei0qYunkKZD23ch0nvYq.jpg", "actors": ["Jere Ristsepp\u00e4 (Lenni)", "Rosa Honkonen (Kiira)", "Ville Haapasalo (Janne)", "Abshir Sheik Nur (Abdi)", "Pihla Viitala (Ansku)", "Katja K\u00fcttner (Satu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "AuW_GEnxSC8"}
