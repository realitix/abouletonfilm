It tells the story of a man who travels across country, from San Francisco to Brooklyn, dressed up as a clown.  He does this in an effort to recreate a similar voyage undertaken by a man in the midst of an existential crisis some years earlier.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/utRWubaIWZApYAXTfCmIMTvVG9c.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
