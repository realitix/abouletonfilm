She\u2019s your typical 17 year-old girl in search of something more in her life. It seems the only place she is going to find it is at Horse Camp. Her father Luke (Dean Cain, Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman) recognizes that she\u2019s got it in her blood, a sensibility in her being - she understands horses just as much as they understand her.
