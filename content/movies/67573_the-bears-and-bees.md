They nibble some flowers and find a bee, which they follow to the hive, which they then proceed to raid. The big bear chases them off, but unknown to him, a bee spotted the raid and has summoned the attack squad. The bees run him off, and the cubs dig in.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nEzP1mW1zaCpqOQlytQG9MQX82f.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [66829, 67585, 66826, 66822], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
