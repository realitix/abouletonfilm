The title character, played by Ana Maria Martins Guerra, is a young Portuguese girl who lives with her grandmother. Through their relationship, we are witness to the Cycle of Life: Grandmother takes care of granddaughter until granddaughter is obliged to do same for grandmother. The scenes between the two protagonists are counterpointed with impressionistic camera compositions based upon famous religious paintings. Ana was impressive enough to earn an American art-house release, a rarity for independently produced Portuguese films.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/69bmpxmBgb70gfZjR3IHbfOflmq.jpg", "actors": ["Ana Maria Martins Guerra (Ana)", "Oct\u00e1vio Lixa Filgueiras ()", "Manuel Ramalho Eanes ()", "Aurora Alfonso ()", "Mariana Margarido ()", "Adelaide Ferreira ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
