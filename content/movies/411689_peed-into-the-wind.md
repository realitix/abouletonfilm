It\u2019s loaded with a lot of big scenes and unusual looking people that make this epic resemble a clogged toilet. Unfortunately, since several of the performers were not as loyal as Ainslie Pryor and John Thomas, the plot is difficult to follow but in no way hinders the sewer-like sequences. It\u2019s quite enjoyable and possesses the releasing power of an enema.\u201d \u2013George Kuchar", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vdf7xgekDbzBSGMWsaXto8GEgKi.jpg", "actors": ["George Kuchar ()", "Ainslie Pryor ()", "John Thomas ()", "Curt McDowell (Mick Terrific)", "Mark Ellinger ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
