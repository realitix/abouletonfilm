The area has a number of legends and spiritual traditions, and is a \"New Age\" site of interest: ley lines are considered to converge on the Tor. The nearest town to the festival site is Shepton Mallet, three miles (5 km) north east, but there continues to be interaction between the people espousing alternative lifestyles living in Glastonbury and the festival itself. The farm is situated between the A361 and A37 roads.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/erjivoOgtB9AgrHa323NCUIfQFc.jpg", "actors": ["Amy Winehouse (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "LQH_vGIM1A0"}
