JG is a 35mm anamorphic film shot on location in the saline landscapes of Utah and central California using Dean\u2019s recently developed and patented system of aperture gate masking. An unprecedented departure from her previous 16mm films, JG tries to respond to Ballard\u2019s challenge \u2013 posed to her shortly before he died \u2013 that Dean should 'treat the Spiral Jetty as a mystery her film would solve.' \"  - Anthology Film Archives", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sMqi6on6lWQk9lbjtziTZ1HKreo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
