Mona Paparu is a single mother who has been left to raise her daughter Viorica on her own, only to have her fitness as a parent called into question by her aunt Rodica. Forced to answer Rodica's charges in a meeting with Child Protective Service authorities, Mona tells the long, convoluted tale of how she fell in with Viorel, a charming but sinister underworld figure, in order to provide for her daughter. As Mona falls into debt to Viorel, he puts her to work in a variety of illegal enterprises, finally ending up in the Bibliotheque Pascal, an elegant but bizarre house of prostitution in which men can re-enact sexual scenarios inspired by great works of literature for a hefty fee. Bibliotheque Pascal was an official selection at the 2010 Berlin International Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xZPAfmKKqexvZCJ5DR2yRPqfOzd.jpg", "actors": ["Orsolya T\u00f6r\u00f6k-Illy\u00e9s (Mona)", "Andi Vasluianu (Viorel)", "Shamgar Amram (Pascal)", "R\u0103zvan Vasilescu (Gigi Paparu)", "Oana Pellea (Rodica Paparu)", "Tibor P\u00e1lffy (Saxophone player)", "Florin Piersic Jr. (Countryman)", "Mihai Constantin (Gicu)", "Orion Radies (Little boy)", "Alexandru Bindea (Police chief)", "Mihai Calin (Police officer)", "Ildik\u00f3 Antal (Melinda)", "Dorel Visan (Mayor)", "Marius Bodochi (Ursica 1.)", "Marius Manole (Ursica 2)", "Garry Cooper (The Professor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [214069, 82708], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
