A master at playing nervous and neurotic characters, Knotts is also able to milk major laughs with his portrayals of romantically-challenged underdogs possessing oversized egos.  In this special comedy collection, he is joined by singer-actress Joey Heatherton, actress Jane Powell, former Dallas Cowboys player Lance Rentzel, comic Jack Burns, Knott's Love God movie co-star Maureen Arthur and the legendary Jimmy Durante.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vmFLlkCITIXhk6w4GCTQojDHwFP.jpg", "actors": ["Don Knotts (Himself)", "Joey Heatherton (Herself)", "Jane Powell (Herself)", "Lance Rentzel (Himself)", "Maureen Arthur (Herself)", "Jimmy Durante (Himself)", "Jack Burns (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
