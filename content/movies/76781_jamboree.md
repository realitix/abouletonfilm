Kay Medford heads the cast as manipulative showbiz agent Grace Shaw. Hoping to land pop singer Pete Porter (Paul Carr), Grace connives to break up Pete's romance with female vocalist Honey Wynn (Freda Holloway). But who cares? The audience came to see such musical faves as Fats Domino, Count Basie, Jerry Lee Lewis, Jodie Sands, Ron Coby, Slim Whitman, Carl Perkins, Frankie Avalon, Charlie Gracie and the Four Coins. As a promotional tie-in, Jamboree also features appearances by 21 of North America's top rock-and-roll deejays.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/VQR4qokzvnFL3VN5v9LdzwFhHP.jpg", "actors": ["Fats Domino (Fats Domino)", "Jerry Lee Lewis (Jerry Lee Lewis)", "Jimmy Bowen (Jimmy Bowen)", "Buddy Knox (Buddy Knox)", "Frankie Avalon (Frankie Avalon)", "Connie Francis (Connie Francis)", "Cauby Peixoto (Disc Jockey Ron Coby)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "zvlh0enQRQ0"}
