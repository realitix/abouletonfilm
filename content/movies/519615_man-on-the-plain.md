He lives poorly selling pigs with the only company of thirty dogs, two cats and a sheep in the heart of the Argentinian humid pampa. This year, his only neighbour and friend Hugo has made up his mind to move to the city as soon as the autumn arrives, after spending his whole life in the countryside.
