Malina, along with a motley crew of amateur rocket enthusiasts and fellow California Institute of Technology students, conducted the first stand-up rocket engine test on Halloween in 1936 in the Pasadena Arroyo. On this 75th anniversary of those tests, this 90-minute, intensely personal documentary explores the complexities of Malina's life and the profound ramifications his work had on Caltech and the nation. \"Though there are many fascinating characters in the American Rocketeer, at its core, this film is a personal story of one man's dreams,\" noted producer Blaine Baggett, \"and how his ideas and idealism put him on a collision course with the world.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gPwJranwKbSiacG2aLrshajyeRl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
