The similarity in look between Hunter and Monroe also came into play when a nude Hunter starred in a film short called Apple Knockers and Coke. For many years there have been those who have seen the film and have mistaken Hunter for Monroe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/swpEGCF6ES5ywcOOKYqgMOy7eMJ.jpg", "actors": ["Arline Hunter ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
