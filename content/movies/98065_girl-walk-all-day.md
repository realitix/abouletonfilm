They turn the city's sidewalks, parks, and stadiums into an evolving stage as a story of rebellion, love, and discovery unfolds. Shot entirely in public spaces, and funded entirely by crowd-sourcing, the film is a statement about the power of community and public space. Set to the album \"All Day\" by mashup musician Girl Talk, it's also an insanely fun love letter to New York.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aex8nH9kbOzYYUEv4iJMiys6bxn.jpg", "actors": ["Anne Marsen (The Girl)", "Dai Omiya (The Gentleman)", "John Doyle (The Creep)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [24654, 16014, 45694, 10932], "youtube_key": "Myvf6Yqc3U0"}
