Two were documentaries, but most were low-budget science fiction movies with recognizable actors, such as Adam West, Fred Willard, Peter Mark Richman, Kristine DeBell, and Martin Kove. They\u2019re talky, dull, and visually static, but there\u2019s something intriguing about them that I can\u2019t articulate, and they\u2019re no worse than Don Dohler\u2019s films.\r\n\r\nCAPTIVE is one of the duo\u2019s better features, though the impenetrable technobabble that passes for dialogue and the tissue-paper sets prevent me from calling it \u201cgood.\u201d Mitchell (CAROUSEL) and former child star Ladd (THE PROUD REBEL), whose wife Cheryl was making a zillion dollars on CHARLIE\u2019S ANGELS at the time, play aliens from the planet Styrolia, which is locked in an intergalactic war with future Earth. Much of the first act is these guys sitting in a very small spaceship cockpit set saying things that make no sense, except for Mitchell\u2019s demented ramblings about the joy of killing Earthmen. They\u2019re also wearing striped shirts modeled after the Sandmen in LOGAN\u2019S RUN.\r\n\r\nAt least the homemade special effects are decently done on this budget level with Emenegger and Sandler filling the screen with space battles, animated laser blasts, and state-of-the-art (for the era) computer displays. The effects have a certain charm. If only it were enough to distract from Seth Marshall III\u2019s dialogue, which is ridden with cliches and portentous science chatter. \r\n\r\nAfter expending its effects budget in Act I, CAPTIVE settles into a cost-efficient riff on DESPERATE HOURS, as Ladd and Mitchell crash near an Earth farm and take its inhabitants \u2014 PETTICOAT JUNCTION hottie Saunders, younger siblings Ashley Emenegger and Dan Sandler (horrible actors, but related to the directors), and modern-world-hating gramps Sturkie (THEY CALL ME TRINITY) \u2014 hostage.\r\n\r\nAlthough the story is satisfactorily wrapped at the end of Act II, the directors pad the film for a two-hour TV timeslot with an expanded coda that at least takes the movie outside for fresh air after over an hour on three basic sets. Editor Ken Lavet and associate producer Anne Spielberg, Steven\u2019s sister who earned an Oscar nomination for co-writing BIG, are credited with directing the control room sequences set on Earth."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
