Larry Williams demonstrates the traditional method of making a pair of hollows and rounds from a solid billet, including blade making, hardening and tempering. Hollows and rounds are used in combination to make complex moldings. This unique work is interesting both as a historical record of hand tool making, as well as a guide for those who wish to make their own molding planes for use.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/itvIojiTUQmNJvFHofgMBgLAiwv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
