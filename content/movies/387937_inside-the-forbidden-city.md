When Li gives birth to the Emperor's child, the jealous Liu switches the boy with a cat and commands a servant named Kou Zhu to kill the baby. However, Kou Zhu ignores the order and gives the prince-to-be to the emperor's brother, a decision which eventually leads to the boy being adopted by the emperor himself! But as fate would have it, to go along with his new son, the emperor has a new wife as well - Madame Liu! As this strange new family unit is being constructed, poor Li Zhenfei has been confined to the forbidden palace, condemned to never see or speak to her son, the prince. But destiny reunites her with her son, but will this family reunion be a happy one? And will Madame Liu finally be punished for her treachery?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5MZGRqyRreyKLY1JJsIOoH6rdWs.jpg", "actors": ["Ivy Ling Po (Kou Zhu)", "Cheng Miu (Judge Bao Zheng)", "Chin Feng (Emperor)", "Kao Pao-shu (Empress Liu)", "Ou-Yang Sha-Fei (Concubine Li Zheng Fei)", "Li Ching (Fei's maid act as Zhu's ghost)", "Chan Yau-San (Eunuch Guo Huai)", "Ku Wen-Chung (Eunuch Chen Lin)", "Tien Feng (Prime Minister)", "Yeung Chi-Hing (Emperor's Brother)", "Chan Wan-Wa (Empress Di)", "Cheung Kwong-Chiu (Fan Zhong Hua)", "Hao Li-Jen (Prison Warden)", "Fan Dan (Bao Xing)", "Fung Ngai (Wang Zhao)", "Kwan Yan (Ma Han)", "Wong Nin (Zhao Hu)", "Tsui Kwan-Sang (Zhang Long)", "Chan Lo-Wah (Midwife Yu)", "Ho Fan (Empress Di's Son)", "Gam Tin-Chue (General)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
