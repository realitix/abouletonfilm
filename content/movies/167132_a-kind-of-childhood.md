It peeks into a world where the concept of childhood as we know it has no meaning, where children support their parents, and where work is just another part of growing up. This is Dhaka, Bangladesh. Following several children over a period of six years, A KIND OF CHILDHOOD is an attempt to focus on the realities of child labor, with real children, their struggles and dreams.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nMTM15QZ25x4LAvOzWdlOZ1DHje.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "kiDaaFeSX5U"}
