{"tmdb_id": 47483, "title": "Yeah No Definitely", "original_title": "Yeah No Definitely", "slug_title": "yeah-no-definitely", "date": "2007-07-15", "genre": ["Drame"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "'yeah no definitely' is about a young man unable to express himself, and the danger he poses when his long-seething emotions finally explode. Cam and Kiff are students in an intense platonic relationship. At a summer party, Cam becomes intoxicated and angry. He's unwilling to admit his attraction to Kiff, and unable to release powerful feelings of grief he's holding inside. Kiff hopes having a good time might make Cam forget his pain. Both are in denial, and the truth's suppression may kill one of them before the night is over. The film is a study in self-deception, a theme worth exploring now, when Americans seem particularly desperate to avoid dealing with reality, and grasp at any diversion rather than look in the mirror.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Vincent Piazza (Cam)", "Alan Barnes Netherton (Kiff)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "6wPi-7klvzY"}
