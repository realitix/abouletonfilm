She teases the older man mercilessly--going to a hotel and dancing with him naked and then suddenly getting dressed and running off to a party with a young American guy. But it's not so much because she is malicious, but because she is really an insecure virgin. Finally, he gives up on her after his beautiful wife (Barbara Bouchet) shows up. But the younger woman becomes jealous and is not going to give up so easily. . .", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iq52wnq7C9wmvmMxk0xQrTBsHV5.jpg", "actors": ["Philippe Leroy (Fabio Lorenzi)", "Leonora Fani (Ornella Bernardi)", "Barbara Bouchet (Silvia Lorenzi)", "Stefano Amato (Andrea)", "Serena Cociani ()", "Filippo De Gara ()", "Maria Pia Conte ()", "Dana Ghia ()", "Pupo De Luca ()", "Dante Cleri ()", "Luigi Antonio Guerra ()", "Carla Mancini ()", "Walter Manfredi ()", "Fiorella Masselli ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
