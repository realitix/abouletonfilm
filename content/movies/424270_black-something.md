(KUMIKO, THE TREASURE HUNTER) to make a short piece in response to a Criterion Collection release that they considered inspiring. The brothers chose Louis Malle's wild, hallucinogenic BLACK MOON (1975), itself a tripped-out reimagining of \"Alice in Wonderland.\" Shot in the woods near their Austin homes, BLACK SOMETHING captures Malle's blending of idyllic pastoral imagery with nightmarish fantasy, distilling it into a skin-crawlingly unsettling three-minute short.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z4jbQiNVg7pkYVq7KBDSPjroRyL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
