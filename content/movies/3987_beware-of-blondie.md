Mr. Dithers leaving Dagwood (Arthur Lake) in charge of the office for a short period.  Poor old Dagwood manages to gum things up when he falls for a confidence scam engineered by the duplicitous Toby Clifton (Adele Jergens).  He even finds himself in a compromising position that seriously endangers his future connubial happiness with wife Blondie (Penny Singleton).  Once again, it's up to Blondie to straighten out the mess.  Mr. Dithers is played by an uncredited Edward Earle, who is seen only from the back; Earle's voice is dubbed over with an old recording of Jonathan Hale, the series' original Dithers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bqv9AwnDj80xgu6nDOVetohEZyx.jpg", "actors": ["Penny Singleton (Blondie Bumstead)", "Arthur Lake (Dagwood \" Dag \" Bumstead)", "Larry Simms (Alexander Bumstead)", "Marjorie Ann Mutchie (Cookie Bumstead)", "Adele Jergens (Toby Clifton)", "Dick Wessel (Mailman)", "Jack Rice (Ollie Shaw)", "Alyn Lockwood (Mary)", "Edward Earle (J.C.
