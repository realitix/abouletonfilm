It is a short film based on Beauty and an Airplane, a short story by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Ratanaruang's film tells the story of a man (Ananda Everingham) who falls in love with a woman (Khemapsom Sirisukha) he sees at the check-in counter of an airport. Most of the film takes place in the sleek blackened interior of the plane's cabin -- the camera panning between the two seats, lighting now one, now the other of the occupants. The two passengers never exchange a word, title cards occasionally allowing us to know what the man is thinking. Those familiar only with his work on Dumplings or Wong Kar-wai's films might be surprised at cinematographer Christopher Doyle's uncustomary restraint. Christopher Doyle doubles as both taxi driver and captain in the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t2dUUtSkx2VXm6nmSWQC7Gsapdo.jpg", "actors": ["Christopher Doyle (Taxi Driver / Captain)", "Ananda Everingham (Man)", "Khemapsorn Sirisukha (Woman)", "Preenun Nana (Air Hostess)", "Santi Taepanich (Security agent)", "Erich Fleishman (German Guard)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
