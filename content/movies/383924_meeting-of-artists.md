But what a family! L\u00e9on Spilliaert, Paul Delvaux, Edgar Tytgat and his wife Maria, Luc and Paul Haessaerts. A garden, some seats and a camera that films the group of friends. They talk (given all the jollity, laughter and gestures seen it is a shame that it is a silent film). A period document only a few minutes long, a witness that puts names to faces, a reminder of a sunny afternoon. Emotion that loses itself in the moment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iOzxFkcCLZXajEw7jWfiV6T0waZ.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Delvaux ()", "Edgard Tytgat ()", "Marie Tytgart ()", "Marie Tytgat ()", "Marie Tytgat ()", "Marie Tytgat ()", "Paul Haesaerts ()", "Luc Haesaerts ()", "Luc Haesaerts ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
