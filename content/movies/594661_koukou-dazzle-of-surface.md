These lights change into various expressions with the characteristics of the objects they reflect on. By controlling light, Hirata exaggerates the reflecting rays. This act purifies the light itself and is solely an attempt to abstract the world of vision that is formed by the reflecting of radiant energy. The power of the beam is relative to that of the filmmaker's gaze. The rays eventually gather, become a mass, and repeat intense expansion and contraction. At this moment, Hirata, using light as the medium, is facing this world with complete precision.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kYBis4iP8fdOm2ByyZkLG5sIima.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
