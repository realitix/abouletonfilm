They befriend a fisherman and his wife but are forced to run for their lives when soldiers on a military exercise decide to take home some fox pelts as souvenirs. A sweet little film that obliquely symbolizes the plight of Japan's aboriginal Ainu people and the northern islands that have been contested with Russia since they were occupied by Stalin's soldiers in 1945.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s1vfF4BooRWwSgqsCtjQ9nwbLHT.jpg", "actors": ["Mikiko Otonashi (Mother Fox (voice))", "Shinobu Adachi (Koro (voice))", "Tsutomu Sasaki (Father Fox (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
