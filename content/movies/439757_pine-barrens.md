The camera is always in motion \u2014 tracking, pivoting, and walking through the landscape. Though they are never seen in the film, the voices of the local people, the 'Pineys,' are heard relating their feelings about the land, their attitudes about city life, their myths of the area, etc. their voices and the music of 'Bill Patton's Pine Barrens Trio' add a psychological dimension to the landscape.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s8ItGaczVaauUMDYLkHeOeFCyeD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
