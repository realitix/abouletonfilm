The platoon is eventually deployed to Grenada in late October, 1983, in order to prevent a communist takeover and rescue some med students.\r\n\r\nThirteen years after \u201cThe Dirty Dozen,\u201d Eastwood recycles the plot and adds a lot of hip comedy. Although it\u2019s not a great military flick like \u201cDozen\u201d it has its points of entertainment, but you have to roll with the odd mixture of believable military training drama with heavy doses of amusement, mainly revolving around the cartoonish character of Cpl. Stitch Jones, played with fervor by Mario Van Peebles. If you can acclimate to this odd mixture, there\u2019s a lot to enjoy here.\r\n\r\nIt helps that the movie hooks you in with the opening jail fight involving the hard-living Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Highway (Eastwood). His reunion with his ex-wife and their potentially developing relationship is another hook. Some parts are kinda meh, but there\u2019s enough good here if you\u2019re in the mood for a military training flick in the form of \u201cThe Dirty Dozen\u201d meeting \u201cTop Gun\u201d (1987) mixed with an edgier version of Gomer Pyle.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes and was shot at Camp Pendleton, Southern Cal, as well as Santa Clarita (caf\u00e9), San Clemente (bar), El Toro (airfield homecoming) and Vieques, Puerto Rico (Grenada).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"}], "recommandations_id": [8879, 10724, 10651, 10650]}
