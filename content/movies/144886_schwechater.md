The beer company undoubtedly thought they were commissioning a film that would help them sell their beers; Kubelka had other ideas. He shot his film with a camera that did not even have a viewer, simply pointing it in the general direction of the action. He then took many months to edit his footage, while the company fumed and demanded a finished product. Finally he submitted a film, 90 seconds long, that featured extremely rapid cutting (cutting at the limits of most viewers' perception) between images washed out almost to the point of abstraction \u2014 in black-and-white positive and negative and with red tint \u2014 of dimly visible people drinking beer and of the froth of beer seen in a fully abstract pattern.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8yQ7YWFaihcGBj4nbLHpdsEvMeL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [130314, 141419, 109398, 209752], "youtube_key": "cy78LNZFMIE"}
