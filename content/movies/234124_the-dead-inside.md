Something terrible has happened, the undead are out in force; roaming the streets and devouring all who get in their way. A group of soldiers, civilians and teenagers take shelter in a local school for protection from the undead hordes outside, but no rescue is coming. Food is running low - morale doubly so, tensions are high and things are looking bad when a stranger arrives outside the gate. Then they get a whole lot worse.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2bdoAZUZA4gMc7f84nnXf6KJUqm.jpg", "actors": ["Luke Hobson (Adam)", "Nicky Paul Barton (Tom)", "Roger Fowler (Darren)", "Samuel Hogarth (Aiden)", "David Wayman (PTE Paul Bradburn)", "James Harrison (SGT Faulkner)", "Simon Mathews (PTE Mark Dowling)", "Simon Mathews (Rachel)", "Abby Simpson (Jenny)", "Simon Nader (Wayne Andrews)", "James Call\u00e0s Ball (Lee)", "Stuart J.
