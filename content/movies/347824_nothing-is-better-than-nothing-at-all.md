The only capital he possesses is a group ticket for the public transport system. After hearing about people who supplement their inadequate incomes by 'escorting' groups of tourists across the city, Mr Peters decides to apply the same method to his own situation. The filmmaker starts a business as an 'independent travel escort' and enters an obscure world of supplementary jobs and adventurous business models.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pULz70dWU0RzbwpY02qsixnqGB2.jpg", "actors": ["Jan Peters (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
