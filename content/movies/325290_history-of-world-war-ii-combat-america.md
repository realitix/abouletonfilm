The Flying Fortress first flew on July 28, 1935. Few B-17s were in service at the end of 1941, but by May 1945 an amazing 12,726 B-17s had rolled out of the factories. With a maximum speed of 300 mph and an astounding range of 1850 miles, the Flying Fortress struck terror in the hearts of Germans whenever it took to the skies. Come fly with the daring men of the United States Army Air force in their matchless bombers. Join the action high over enemy territory. Witness the heartbreaking moments when comrades sacrifice their lives for the country.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
