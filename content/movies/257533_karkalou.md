The main protagonists are a young taxi driver -- a man who has had some very unusual, puzzling, and inspirational experiences -- and a middle-aged painter he gains as a new friend. The two men are complemented by a few tough women (all played by the same actress), a pair of verbose politicos, and a handful of other distinctive characters. By the end of the movie, transformations are in store for the pair of friends, reflecting the tenor of the film throughout. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, Rovi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jBp2HdvzGgxFWZLOUW1j0xpY2Wd.jpg", "actors": ["Ismini Kariotaki (Karkalou)", "Stelios Anastasiadis (Old man)", "Marios Karamanis (Taxi Driver)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
