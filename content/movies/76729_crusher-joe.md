In the early days of space exploration the Crushers took on the job of destroying asteroids and defining space lanes. Because of their work, they were nicknamed \"Crushers\" which eventually became their business moniker. Despite the rough and ready nature of the Crushers' work, they subscribe to a few steadfast rules. Unethical and illegal assignments are taboo, and any Crusher accepting one is barred from the Union. Of course, this presents problems for shady clients who try to trick the Crushers into accepting misleading assignments. They know that once the Union accepts a case the Crushers are honor-bound to follow it through. Among the various worlds, the Crusher Council has a stunning reputation, and among the Crushers, the most elite team is the one led by Crusher Dan and his successor, Crusher Joe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rmIvh9qWorbwDDEozCVUrZks3CM.jpg", "actors": ["Hiraku Takemura (Joe (voice))", "Noriko Ohara  (Ricky (voice))", "Kiyoshi Kobayashi (Talos (voice))", "Issei Futamata (Dongo (voice))", "Gor\u014d Naya (Kowalsky (voice))", "Akira Kume (Dan (voice))", "Kazuyuki Sogabe (Killie (voice))", "Nobuo Tanaka (Valenstinos (voice))", "Daisuke Gouri (Roki (voice))", "Hidekatsu Shibata (Mardola (voice))", "Kazuko Yanaga (Norma (voice))", "Takeshi Watabe (Nero)", "Takeshi Watabe (Nero (Voice))", "Run Sasaki (Alfin (voice))", "Reiko Mutoh (Mature (voice))", "Osamu Kobayashi (Bard (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "gWTL-ABZI3I"}
