Made on 16mm, and incorporating found footage, original material, animation, and processed images (Vancouver's groundbreaking avant-garde cinema of the 1970s is a decided influence here), Fleming's film offers a visually dazzling, emotionally wrenching, oddly humorous account of two profound personal traumas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qRhk4R5RdSM9uGtGPBBRR5sDS6H.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
