Seconds after passing through the sex club doors, Atkins is cruised by the hot, horny men lurking in the club's shadows. Deceived by Atkins' youth and innocent appearance, many of the men assume that he must not be aware of what he's stumbled into; but moments into Resurrection it becomes quite evident to them that looks can be deceiving.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/agHn5MA9Dpqm1wkNNlkbtx62eL.jpg", "actors": ["Adam Wolfe ()", "Ben Archer ()", "Jacob Scott ()", "Jason Branch ()", "Jon Ashe ()", "Nick Capra ()", "Nino Bacci ()", "Paul Johnson ()", "Sky Donovan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
