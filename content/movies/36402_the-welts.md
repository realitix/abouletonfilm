Wojciech's father occasionally tries to, instead, bond with him, but soon snaps back to his short-fused habits. Apart from Wojciech's friend Bartek, no one does anything to help. Jump to present day, Wojciech is a furrow-browed journalist who spends most of his spare time spelunking alone. Just like his father, he has serious anger management issues. Fellow caver Tania feels inexplicably attracted to him, but the love of a good woman may not be enough.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rq1apsWhYzpwcRJXpHES6YBs9NP.jpg", "actors": ["Michal Zebrowski (Wojciech Winkler)", "Jan Frycz (Andrzej Winkler)", "Agnieszka Grochowska (Tania)", "Waclaw Adamczyk (Wojciech Winkler, age 12)", "Borys Szyc (Bartosz)", "Alan Andersz (Bartosz, age 12)", "Leszek Piskorz (Priest)", "Jan Peszek (Editor-in-Chief)", "Dorota Kami\u0144ska (Tania's Mother)", "Damian Dami\u0119cki (Tania's Father)", "Tadeusz Bradecki (Doctor)", "Mikolaj Grabowski (Dr. Sobanski)", "Krystyna Rutkowska-Ulewicz (Mrs. Maciak)", "Maria Maj (Elder Teacher)", "Joanna Orlea\u0144ska (Younger Teacher)", "Violetta Arlak (Secretary)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [112531, 155939, 121455, 76330], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
