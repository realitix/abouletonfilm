Yasmin, Chloe, Jade, and Sasha are in for some fashion-forward adventure when their first task at the mag is to fly to London to cover a super-hot rock concert. Unfortunately, rival journalists from YOUR THING magazine have gotten the same idea. Mean-spirited editor Burdine Maxwell and her evil interns, twins Kirstee and Kaycee, happen to show up right when the Bratz girls lose their passes to the show. Coincidence? Probably not, but now the girls have to find another way to get in, and they realize the only way they can get access is to become a rock band themselves! It's time to rock out and save the mag, all in a day's work for these hip chicks.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gCk57mf83RROb1Qql4BdYBEJcaa.jpg", "actors": ["Tia Mowry (Sasha (voice))", "Soleil Moon Frye (Jade (voice))", "Olivia Hack (Cloe (voice))", "Dionne Quan (Yasmin (voice))", "Wendie Malick (Burdine Maxwell (voice))", "Lacey Chabert (Kaycee (voice))", "Kaley Cuoco (Kirstee (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [60382, 14123, 15189, 9904], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
