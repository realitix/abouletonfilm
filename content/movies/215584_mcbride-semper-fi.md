He takes cases based on their merit rather than on their monetary value, which often leads to terse notices from bill collectors. A disillusioned member of the LAPD, McBride left the force after twelve years and went back to school to become a lawyer. With the aid of his ever-present sidekick, Phil Newberry, and his former girlfriend, Detective Roberta Hansen, McBride and his team solve crimes the old-fashioned way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/47ejDVOOvUoxX5gRmn99HWyIj1h.jpg", "actors": ["John Larroquette (Mike McBride)", "Marta DuBois (Sgt.
