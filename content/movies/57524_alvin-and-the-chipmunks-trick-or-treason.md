Alvin wants to be accepted into the Monster Club, but the Monster members seem to think its cool to be cruel. It takes Theodore's friendship to Michael, a misunderstood outcast the other kids call Pumpkinhead, to show Alvin that being a true friend is really a lot more cool than trying to be a popular Monster! There are plenty of laughs and surprises and music, including the Chipmunk's rendition of the hit song \"Monster Mash\" to make this a monstrously fun video any time of the year!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ntXkEL7wFY5CdNNvmjmpg4uTEsW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [21767, 3126, 48246, 15374], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
