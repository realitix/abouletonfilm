She is disrobed, led to a bath, laid in the water and her finger pricked to draw blood. The witches circle, chanting in strange tongues. As the smoke clears, we see the woman has made the ultimate sacrifice, transforming herself into the object of her desire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fnzRYodGzuDNzTyrw0hGbnpMpfr.jpg", "actors": ["Maya Sansa (The Woman)", "Annie Hart (Witch)", "Erika Spring Forster (Witch)", "Heather D'Angelo (Witch)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
