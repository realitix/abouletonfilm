The fractal graphics that are supposed to overwhelm us as no-cost special effects are horribly dated and left on-screen for way too long.\r\n\r\nI haven't seen director DeGaetano's other, later two films, but I hope they're not the snoozefests that this was. Steer clear of this with all of your might--the poster is the best thing about the movie."}], "recommandations_id": [35664], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
