But before this current wave of fancy shops, mortgage priced bikes, and superstar builders came to light, the chopper subculture was (and still is) heralded by the home-builder. The true essence lies with the guy that works a full day, comes home and then builds in his garage. The guy that turns out a killer custom with limited time, tooling, and resources. This movie pays homage the home bike builder and explores the undergound chopper scene.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
