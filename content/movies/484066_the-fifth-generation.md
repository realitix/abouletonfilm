Nevertheless one would have the sensation that he is the one who risks disappearing. Daniel Berquiny was born in an old Romanian circus family that moved to Italy because they considered it to be the artist\u2019s country. Daniel\u2019s life is intertwined with the show and animals: he began working in the circus and ended up in the movies. A global relationship, made of sweat, labour and dedicated time. And owing to the fact that the contemporary frantic society is not keen on cultivating any relationship with nature, Daniel is forced to resist. And he does so with his fierce look, his strong arms, the tigers and the camels living in the zoo-like refuge he has built.

And as he watches her, he smiles with melancholy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lRCfJjPCILK2ZORvbDGpckH689y.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
