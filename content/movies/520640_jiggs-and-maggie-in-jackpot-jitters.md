Maggie, an inveterate social climber, wants to join the prestigious Northchester Hunt Club, and sends them a check for the $38,000 membership fee. When Jiggs finds out, he manages--after a struggle with Maggie--to take care of the check. Consoling himself at his favorite bar, he's convinced by his drinking buddies that the way to make up with Maggie is to buy her a racehorse that is coming up for auction. He does, only to discover that a doctor has told Maggie that her sneezing fits are due to a rare allergy she has--to horses. Complications ensue.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Joe Yule (Jiggs)", "Renie Riano (Maggie Jiggs)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
