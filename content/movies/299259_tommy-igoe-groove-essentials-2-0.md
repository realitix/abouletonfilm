For more advanced players and professionals, GE 2.0 introduces the concepts of groove construction, interpretation and manipulation- training drummers to think like musicians in order to maximize their full potential. The DVD features more than 70 new songs covering 4/4, 2/2, 6/8 and 3/4 time signatures, with three levels of difficulty for 5/4, 7/8 and 9/8 meters.

The grooves span rock, funk, RandB/hip-hop, jazz (sticks and brushes), world/specialty, extreme tempos, all-purpose, hybrid, rideless, classic and odd-meters.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
