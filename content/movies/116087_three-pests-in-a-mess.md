When they learn they'll have to catch 100,000 flies to earn enough to get a patent, some crooks overhear and think the boys are the $100,000 sweepstakes winners. When the crooks give chase, the stooges hide in a sporting goods store where Curly shoots a dummy, which they mistake for a real person. The boys decide to bury the \"body\" in a pet cemetery, but the cemetery owner arrives from a costume party with his partners, all dressed as spooks, and they proceed to scare the devil out of the stooges.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b5qCrj1D4K2so03xNLIJolZQq3f.jpg", "actors": ["Curly Howard (Curly)", "Larry Fine (Larry)", "Moe Howard (Moe)", "Christine McIntyre (Cheatham's Secretary)", "Brian O'Hara (I.
