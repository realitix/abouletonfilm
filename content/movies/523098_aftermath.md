This quartet of hauntologies reframes the cruel reductions of biography to focus on death and doubles. Repurposing archival texts (the diaries of Khalo, the testimonies of Waller\u2019s kin and familiars) as audiovisual graffiti, old voices are cropped and replayed as intertitles or voice-over fragments, lending a historic charge to images that dream across the present.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lZIJUP0PQHRhnRnw2FH8RsEBVRL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
