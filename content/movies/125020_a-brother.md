The impetuous, promiscuous Loic is a talented photographer about to make it to the big time, but being pulled back by loyalty to his best friend and ex-lover, both junkies. Sophie, a schoolgirl on holidays, is quietly undergoing a sexual awakening, observing from a distance Loic's milieu; she begins an affair with his business partner to Loic's quasi-incestuous disapproval. Loic is spotted by a prominent editor, but becomes increasingly unhinged, by his friend's violent struggles with dealers, by his lover's demands, by Sophie's 'betrayal', by his own 'demons'. Tragedy inevitably strikes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gkq4ucoxa4GZ7snsxGKrf4wXsbL.jpg", "actors": ["Emma de Caunes (Sophie)", "Jeannick Gravelines (Loic)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [164126, 86369, 70270, 25512], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
