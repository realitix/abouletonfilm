There were three rules: (1) The film could be no longer than 52 seconds, (2) no synchronized sound was permitted, and (3) no more than three takes. The results run the gamut from Zhang Yimou's convention-thwarting joke to David Lynch's bizarre miniature epic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tRgWAb0tWl5HEnk0XT2C3QV3Jlx.jpg", "actors": ["Jeffe Alperi ()", "Romane Bohringer ()", "Bruno Ganz ()", "Ticky Holgado ()", "Alan Rickman (Himself)", "Liam Neeson (Himself)", "Stephen Rea (Himself)", "Sven Nykvist (Himself)", "Lena Olin ()", "Pascal Duquenne ()", "Nathalie Richard ()", "Nicolaos Charalambons ()", "Neil Jordan (Himself)", "Aidan Quinn (Himself)", "Isabelle Huppert (Voice)", "Sylvia Miles ()", "J\u00fcrgen J\u00fcrges ()", "Otto Sander ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [57251, 131964, 73455, 78786], "youtube_key": "M0aqmD90pE0"}
