One morning a cow appears in their kitchen. The cow does not seek contact, does not eat, or defecate, but simply stands between the fridge and kitchen table. Gradually, the family gets used to the cow and even starts endearingly call it Buryonka. Everything goes well, until the somewhat senile grandfather mistakes Buryonka for an enemy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ir2mhh9BcBIIMyaL8sbdhCb2Mu7.jpg", "actors": ["Vitali Khodin ()", "Maria Bolonkina ()", "Gleb Orlov ()", "Yaroslava Bazaeva ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
