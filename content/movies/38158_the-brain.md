Although today s computers can make calculations in one-100th of a second and technology can transport us outside the bonds of Earth, only now are we beginning to understand the most complex machine in the universe. Using simple analogies, real-life case studies, and state-of-the-art CGI, this special shows how the brain works, explains the frequent battle between instinct and reason, and unravels the mysteries of memory and decision-making. It takes us inside the mind of a soldier under fire to see how decisions are made in extreme situations, examines how an autistic person like Rain Man develops remarkable skills, and takes on the age-old question of what makes one person good and another evil. Research is rushing forward. We\u2019ve learned more about the workings of the brain in the last five years than in the previous one hundred.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oFLKAXwRbyZph2dJGx1XnbNHhvO.jpg", "actors": ["Erik Thompson (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
