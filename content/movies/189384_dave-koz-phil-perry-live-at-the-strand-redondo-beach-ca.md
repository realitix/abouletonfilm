His career catapulted with 1993's Lucky Man, one of Koz' slickest and most commercial releases (which is not a bad thing by any means) to date. The album has an undeniably crisp and clean feel, akin to the color schemes used in the artwork. The musical styles range from funky and peppy, as in the opening \"Shakin' the Shack,\" \"Silverlining,\" and the evergreen \"You Make Me Smile,\" to tender and sweet, as in \"Faces of the Heart,\" \"Lucky Man,\" and \"Tender Is the Night,\" which features hypnotic vocals courtesy of Phil Perry.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6TAugrD2iKGF6W6qjXSvFCcATGN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
