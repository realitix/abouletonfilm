It has some good points, including the complete abandonment of the sort of surrealistic stage design that had enlivened the silent cinema. Instead, this tries for a purely cinematic technique, including multiple exposures, undercranking and distorting camera angles and lenses.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xGWrjsUf8bYnm21qxU1GS5I9hzF.jpg", "actors": ["Aribert Mog (Igor)", "Margot Ferra (Erika Walter)", "Elsa Wagner (Erikas Mutter)", "Ernst Busch (S\u00e4nger)", "Leo Monosson (S\u00e4nger)", "Harald Paulsen (S\u00e4nger)", "Greta Keller (S\u00e4ngerin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
