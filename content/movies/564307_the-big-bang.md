He rubs sticks of dynamite together and regales the audience with torrid tales of his loves and losses. It's a rather decent way of linking together these otherwise unrelated scenes, and the sex itself sparkles with enthusiasm and passion. Kristara Barrington shows why she was the first Asian gal to become a full-fledged hardcore starlet, taking on a younger version of our hero in a steamy, incendiary coupling. Nikki Knights plays the first great love of his life, and she turns in an exceedingly erotic performance. Nikki's youthful high spirits and obvious lust for on-screen carnality combine to make a heady, heated cocktail. With a stellar turn from Nina Hartley and a vivacious tryst from a young Shanna McCullough, this romp has all the ingredients for a simply spectacular sexvid.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7Zsl86OBwfEmg7CyexKf7IN5PFJ.jpg", "actors": ["Erica Idol ()", "Gabriella ()", "Kristara Barrington ()", "Lili Marlene ()", "Nikki Knights ()", "Nina Hartley ()", "Shanna McCullough ()", "Susie Saunders ()", "Chris B.
