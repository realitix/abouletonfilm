Pursued by a U.S. Marshall from Utah who specializes in clown cases, they become dangerously entangled with a swindling cult leader whose truck (full of scammed cash) they have stolen to pull their trailer. It's a crazed festival of guns, puppets, blood, rubber noses and dark humor.  (By the way, none of this is nearly as interesting as it sounds.)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cNpgWwYMFZzhnsslTquW4Pq9SVL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
