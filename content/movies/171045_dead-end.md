But after a short but restful break in the journey Carl awakens to find himself tied and bound in an old roadside diner, his family trussed and gagged next to him, and a disparate group of dirty, disheveled, vagrant-like undesirables keeping them captive. Only time will reveal who they are and what they want, but things are not everything they might seem.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/PHj7dzxRXMv05LHdiYaZe4KQFT.jpg", "actors": ["Jamie Foreman (Dog)", "Wil Johnson (Carl Foster)", "Jon Campling (Diggs)", "Angela Dixon (Maddie Foster)", "Frances Speedie (Frances Speedie)", "Lucy Drive (Mamon)", "Jill Greenacre (Bones)", "Callum Anderson (Lucas Foster)", "Gabriel Lee (Lupo)", "Arti Shah (Little Lady)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [246218, 127722, 171688, 44646], "youtube_key": "Pg7iTU49-bo"}
