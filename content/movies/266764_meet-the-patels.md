For Ravi Patel, a first generation Indian-American, the odds are slim. His ideal bride is beautiful, smart, funny, family-oriented, kind and\u2014in keeping with tradition\u2014Indian (though hopefully raised in the US). Oh, and her last name should be Patel because in India, Patels usually marry other Patels. And so at 30, Ravi decides to break up with his American girlfriend (the one who by all accounts is perfect for him except for her red hair and American name) and embark on a worldwide search for another Patel longing to be loved. He enlists the help of his matchmaker mother, attends a convention of Patels living in the US and travels to wedding season in India. Witty, honest and heartfelt, this comedy explores the questions with which we all struggle: What is love? What is happiness? And how in the world do we go about finding them?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nlGLhC45K691KwTB9k4OQhFWvkI.jpg", "actors": ["Ravi Patel (Himself)", "Geeta Patel (Herself)", "Champa V.
