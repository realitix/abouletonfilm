On that holiday, adults behave like children (intentionally) and in this story, three families get together to celebrate the feast. It is a time to bridge the generation gap and reach out past barriers otherwise rigidly in place, and the adults make every effort as they mix in with the children. This film by distinguished Dutch director Fons Rademakers won the Silver Bear award at the 1961 Berlin Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2y5Ch5wELsZMIzH06R0gAsAgXWO.jpg", "actors": ["Ellen Vogel (Norah Leegher-Buwalda)", "Guus Hermus (De heer Leegher)", "Ank van der Moer (Mevrouw Keizer)", "Jan Teulings (De heer Keizer)", "Yoka Berretty (Mevrouw Lomijn)", "Guus Oster (De heer Lomijn)", "Mieke Verstraete (Emma)", "Ina van Faassen ()", "Manfred de Graaf ()", "Ton van Duinhoven ()", "Leontine Van Strein ()", "Catherine Bottemanne ()", "Maxim Hamel ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
