In his own time, Harg works on ideas for a revolutionary new manufacturing process for hard steel. When his father is badly injured in a workplace accident resulting from employer negligence, Harg uses some of the compensation payment to develop his invention to a stage where it can be tested in practice. It is a huge success and Harg patents his process. He rises to a position on the board of the company, before staging a coup to oust his former employer and take over the business himself.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["John Stuart (James 'Iron' Harg)", "Benita Hume (Audrey Paxton)", "Franklin Dyall (Charles Paxton)", "Heather Angel (Ann Ford)", "Alexander Field (Sweepy Ford)", "Sydney Benson (Lodger)", "Mary Merrall (Mrs. Harg)", "Edward Ashley (Sylvano)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
