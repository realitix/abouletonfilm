The team has its Boss, Vasko; its driver (and, incidentally, its ladies' man) Gecata; and its IT expert, Boreto. The company's only assets are a minivan and the boys' ingenuity and brains. But you can still rely on them for anything! They will save your hapless cat from the dangerous heights of a tree or investigate a convoluted espionage affair - all for a small fee, of course", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vtWNEAwbv8Zeyh86dpbDgmnpea1.jpg", "actors": ["Vasko Mavrikov (Vasko)", "Evgeni Budinov (Getzata)", "Ivelin Naydenov (Boreto)", "Diana Lyubenova (Mrs. Georgieva)", "Marian Valev (Mr. Georgiev)", "Maksim Genchev ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [50400], "youtube_key": "7qs7qQxtUhg"}
