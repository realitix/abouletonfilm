Striking a welcome retro note in its languid pacing and delicate handling of seriocomic ensemble threads, handsome production is a natural for fests. It might also prove a cornerstone for retrospectives or ancillary releases of works by a helmer (\"Preparation of the Festival,\" \"Ronin-gai\") who's long been appreciated at home but has won just limited attention abroad.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1QwqEBySgygAlGBOmIfRzUjLVhV.jpg", "actors": ["Tasuku Emoto ()", "Yoshio Harada ()", "Tokie Hidari ()", "Wakaba Irie ()", "Eri Ishida ()", "Teruyuki Kagawa ()", "Masahiro Komoto ()", "Riho Makise ()", "Junko Miyashita ()", "Hiroko Nakajima ()", "Erika Oda ()", "Susumu Terajima ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
