At first, the young son doesn't mind the unusual arrangement, but as he grows older, he begins to resist the role traditionally meant only for women. In time, Pepito's coming of age intersects with the lives of the other islanders, whose beliefs and struggles become critical impetus to his maturity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g7DfIvoHnqirlkJXTt0AS0fZmqU.jpg", "actors": ["Jomari Yllana (Pepito)", "Elizabeth Oropesa (Rosa)", "Chin Chin Gutierrez ()", "Pen Medina ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
