They aren't after the many followers, but the primary perpetrator of the jitterbug, who they've coined \"Public Jitterbug No. 1\". Hal Sturges is one of several agents working on the case who goes undercover as a dancer in Broadway haunts to find and capture Public Jitterbug No. 1. In his investigation, Hal runs across the beautiful Betty, a seemingly innocent bystander. Hal and Betty fall for each other. However Betty is unaware that Hal is a federal agent, and Hal is unaware that Betty is Public Jitterbug No. 1. Will their roles as agent and public menace number one take priority over their roles of man and woman?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sqCAMfmUU7gkJeFvE00s19ahwDE.jpg", "actors": ["Betty Hutton (Betty)", "Hal Le Roy (Hal Sturges)", "Chaz Chase (Billy)", "Tom Emerson's Hillbilly Sextette (Hillbilly Sextette (as Emerson's Sextette))", "Tom Emerson (Bandleader (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
