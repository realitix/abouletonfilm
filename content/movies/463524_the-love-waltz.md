The plot is a typical Graustarkian affair, with Princess Eva (Harvey) preparing to marry a duke whom she's never met. Getting cold feet, the duke ducks the wedding, persuading a handsome young commoner named Bobby (Willy Fritsch) to take his place. The wedding goes on as planned, with Eva never suspecting that her new hubby is a ringer. Eventually, the false duke confesses everything, leading to all sorts of intrigue before a happy ending can be realized. Love Waltz was simultaneously filmed in an English-language version, which posed no problem for the British-born Harvey but caused a few uncomfortable moments for her Teutonic co-stars (eventually, Willy Fritsch was replaced by John Batton, who'd played a bit role in the German version).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2nRqaXZbgScDo2BNaUMVkFHUQLV.jpg", "actors": ["Lilian Harvey (Princess Eva)", "Georg Alexander (Grandduke Peter Ferdinand)", "John Batten (Bobby Fould)", "Gertrud de Lalsky (Grandduchess Melanie)", "Karl Ludwig Diehl (Lord Chamberlain)", "Hans Junkermann (Fould, Bobby's Father)", "Lilian Mower (Duchess zu Lauenburg)", "C.
