This dichotomy is just one of the characteristics that made him a fascinating subject. The Pleasure of Finding Things Out exposes us to many more of these intriguing attributes by featuring an extensive conversation with the acclaimed Nobel Prize winner.  During the course of the interview, which was conducted in 1981, Feynman uses the undeniable power of the personal to convey otherwise challenging scientific theories. His colorful and lucid stories make abstract concepts tangible, and his warm presence is sure to inspire interest and awe from even the most reluctant student of science. His insights are profound, but his delivery is anything but dry and ostentatious.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7ukEVtCHVJuNJa9czmw1fkZ6u8h.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Feynman (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
