Divided by their diverse reactions to a nascent ideology, the Steeds struggle to hold together as the strength of their convictions and their filial bonds are tested. The stirring narrative of the faith that led a persecuted people to Missouri and beyond is one of the most poignant untold tales of American history. It is the account of a valiant struggle to exercise the rights promised by a fledgling nation. \"The Work and the Glory: American Zion\" unearths the story of the passion behind the movement which eventually launched the largest American migration and the colonization of the West: the vision of a promised land in America.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qAMHUaWig4MoJ6VE90Y14eyE9NG.jpg", "actors": ["Sam Hennings (Benjamin Steed)", "Brenda Strong (Mary Ann Steed)", "Eric Johnson (Joshua Steed)", "Alexander Carroll (Nathan Steed)", "Brighton Hertford (Melissa Steed)", "Kimberly Varadi (Becca Steed)", "Colin Ford (Matthew Steed)", "Emily Podleski (Jessica Roundy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [36046, 18778, 26791, 16668], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
