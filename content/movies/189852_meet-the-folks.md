On the way, he meets a sweet lady and they hit it off well. However, they don't realize that both are coming to visit relatives who are in the middle of a serious feud. Instead of a warm welcome, her kin tries to blow his butt off and he is forced to make a run for it. Unfortunately, his relatives don't seem much nicer, as they treat him rather poorly to say the least!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jimmie Adams (James Pettingill)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
