The projected film, to be called \"Que Viva Mexico\", was never completed due to exhaustion of funds and Stalin's demand that Eisenstein return to the USSR (he had been absent since 1929).  The first attempt at editing the footage, in the USA, resulted in \"Thunder Over Mexico\", released in 1934.  In 1940, Marie Seton, from the UK, acquired some of the footage from the Sinclairs in an attempt to make a better cutting according to Eisenstein's skeletal outline for the proposed film.  This film has apparently been lost.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
