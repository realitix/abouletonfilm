While he nominally runs a courier business to earn a living, he seems to spend most of his time smoking his pipe, drinking sake, and chasing women. The arrival of a Shinsengumi squad led by a young swordswman, Ichimonji Hyougo, disrupts this peaceful routine, forcing Kumosuke to defend himself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dwWzLR6AQVtheIujt5wOJB04TfM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
