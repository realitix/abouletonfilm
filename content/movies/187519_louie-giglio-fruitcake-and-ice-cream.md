Sometimes the best things in life are those we're not even sure we're looking for at the time, but those we realize we can't live without in the end. That's the story of Ashley, a somewhat typical college senior--loving life, partying hard and trying to balance it all with success in the classroom. Disengaged from God and turned off by most Christians she knew, unexpected events turned Ashley's world upside down and brought a new roommate for her final semester at the University of Florida. Unpolished, and marked by unscripted authenticity, Ashley's personal journal entries provide the backdrop for Fruitcake and Ice Cream, a message that breathes hope for the spiritually searching while providing a massive kick-start for those within the Church who carry the unrivaled story of God's grace and truth in a darkened world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3NqaqWhGohVEdVtY4jGO9qAFi6h.jpg", "actors": ["Louie Giglio ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
