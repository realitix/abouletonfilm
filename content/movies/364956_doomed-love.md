Bill Rice \u2018stars\u2019 as a frustrated professor of romantic literature who reaches the end of his rope and resolves to be reunited with his deceased true love. When his attempt to hang himself fails, he finds renewed hope in the form of a nurse at his doctor\u2019s office; newly married and still in love, she is nevertheless intrigued by his morbid romanticism. The action takes place on gigantic, expressionistic sets painted by artists Amy Sillman and Pamela Wilson; movements are exaggerated by being reduced to a minimum, and the dialogue, written by James Neu, calls up the romantic phraseology of the ages \u2013 from literature to TV \u2013 strung together into a musical refrain and set to Evan Lurie\u2019s score.\u201d \u2013PACIFIC FILM ARCHIVE", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7SnBRwCKM7lhxIPLVg4NXfzTOVm.jpg", "actors": ["William Rice (Andre)", "Black-Eyed Susan (Couple on TV)", "Allen Frame (Bob)", "Charles Ludlam (Couple on TV)", "Rosemary Moore (Lois)", "Jim Neu (Psychiatrist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
