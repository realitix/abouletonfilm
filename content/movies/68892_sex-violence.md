There are three stories of persons with confused priorities (including a guy tying his shoe while parachuting); the world's first phone sex; and a clever, if dangerous, way to find a lost key. Except for the titles of each sketch and a couple of jokes that turn on noise, these are visual trips into the psyche of men, women, God, animals, and Time (the enemy of us all).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jIfYbwPeT5tLt8dSiiTwD5SROPv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [85797, 265655, 331489, 315647], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
