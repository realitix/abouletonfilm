The special, a follow-up to 1968's successful TCB program, was a musical revue starring Motown's two most popular groups at the time, Diana Ross & the Supremes and The Temptations. Containing primarily Broadway showtunes, the special was taped before a live studio audience in mid-1969 and originally broadcast November 12, 1969 on NBC. Like TCB, the title of the program was derived from an acronym, this one standing for \"Gettin' It Together\".  A soundtrack album for the special, titled On Broadway, was issued the same month the program aired. Though there were no singles released from this album in the states, \"The Rhythm of Life\" did become a Top 20 hit for the ensemble in Australia.  Two months after its release, Diana Ross left The Supremes to start a solo career.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iPFxSTWiyuo9K2CFOtHZuhWP03P.jpg", "actors": ["Diana Ross (Herself)", "Mary Wilson (Herself)", "Cindy Birdsong ()", "Otis Williams (Himself)", "Dennis Edwards (Himself)", "Eddie Kendricks (Himself)", "Paul Williams (Himself)", "Melvin Franklin (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
