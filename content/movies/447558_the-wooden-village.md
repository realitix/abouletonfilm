The novel and the movie successfully capture the development of Slovak village after the liberation in 1945. The narrative is centred around the characters of the old P\u00faplava, who after the liberation begins to organise a new village life, and his struggle for the construction of settlements Mrz\u00e1\u010dky, burnt by the fascists. It is centred around the conflict, greatly reflecting the situation of the countryside at this time: the conflict between the rural poor and the rural rich.  In the movie, a rich personal and emotional life of other heroes pulsate besides the main storyline. The movie ends with the final defeat of the reactionary forces by Communists in February 1948, taking over all power in the state of workers and peasants. - \"The Wooden Village\" is released in celebration of the 7th anniversary of the Communist February Victory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zSMqgeg8Qrk2I2SEErheH8QzK6B.jpg", "actors": ["Samuel Adam\u010d\u00edk (Peter P\u00faplava)", "Andrej Bagar (Martin Sechn\u00e1r)", "M\u00e1ria Banc\u00edkov\u00e1 (Zuza Sechn\u00e1rov\u00e1)", "Karol Machata (Pavo Sechn\u00e1r)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
