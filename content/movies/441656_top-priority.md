A drought-stricken family maintains a long and desperate vigil for a cloud of dust on the horizon signalling the arrival of irrigation pipes and pump. They are rewarded with a military convoy instead. Its top priority is a border war with a neighboring state, not pipes for the life-saving water the family must have.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yZV4WXezxSeiJNg66kd1pR1WQ7a.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
