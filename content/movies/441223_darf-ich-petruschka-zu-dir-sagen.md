Peter\u2032s retrospection is centred on the relationship with his professional and romantic partner Lotte, who he had once met at a joint performance. Peter remembers the landmarks of their love: their marriage, their child, and Lotte\u2032s severe illness that threatened to end her career. In flashbacks, the film shows how the couple survived this crisis by working sacrificially to return to the stage and celebrate international success.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3NDoZq93xm8eFd8cuMZ833lcdDo.jpg", "actors": ["Frank Bey ()", "Hannelore Bey ()", "Frank Ciazynski ()", "Roland Gawlik ()", "Christine Harbort ()", "Peter Jahoda ()", "Roman Kaminski ()", "Traudl Kulikowsky ()", "Heidemarie Schneider ()", "Wolfgang Winkler ()", "Bernd Storch ()", "Kurt Tauchmann ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
