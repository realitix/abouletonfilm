At first Sum is impressed by the almost superhuman efficiency of the mine's workers, but soon becomes suspicious of the zombie-like manner in which the miners perform their duty. His worst fears are finally confirmed by the colony's resident physician (Deborah Sims), who has been forced to mix a powerful drug into the miners' meals that increases their strength while making them mental slaves of the company. Sum and the doctor prepare to expose the deadly secret, but with every other member of the colony out to get them, they may not live long enough to tell it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zO2QNczTgNlgWhLv7Mmd1az8Tk7.jpg", "actors": ["Austin Wai (Sum Ying Mo)", "Deborah Sims (Dr. Jo Jo)", "Chin Siu Ho (Former security chief killed)", "Yuen Wah (Plant manager)", "Blacky Ko Sau-Leung (Foreman)", "Billy Lau (Dirty Nose)", "Eric Tsang (Mo's recruiter)", "Jacob Cheung (Foreman's fighter with sunglass)", "Rocky Cheng ()", "Kan Wai-On ()", "Lam Cheung-Ming ()", "Leung Hei-Wa ()", "Wong Kiu-Wong ()", "Guk Cho-Fong ()", "Cheng Tin-Ming ()", "Lam Man-Fai ()", "David Ho Wing-Hin (Plant worker gang leader)", "Poon Lok-Ting (Nosy)", "Mandy Chan (Fighter competing with Mo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
