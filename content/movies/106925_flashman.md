He's even got a very Battish theme song\u2026. The somewhat convoluted plot concerns two gang of thieves who rob the same bank. One is a band of babes headed by a ruthless woman; the other is a group of thugs lead by a guy who has a serum that can turn anyone invisible. The employee they rob is none other than Flashman in disguise.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rMq96oJwW119r3bDfUVKaVIIbRl.jpg", "actors": ["Paolo Gozlino (Lord Alex Burman / Flashman)", "Claudie Lange (Alika)", "Ivano Staccioli (Kid)", "Jack Ary (Inspector Baxter)", "Micaela Pignatelli (Nevenka)", "Anne Marie Williams (Sheila)", "Seyna Seyn (Flower)", "Emilio Messina (Kid's Henchman)", "Dada Gallotti (Alika in black)", "Sidi Del Burgo ()", "Marisa Traversi ()", "Gaston Cekani (Commissioner Legrand)", "Sonja Romanoff (Alika in blue)", "Giulio Tomei (Professor Phillips)", "Mirella Pamphili ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
