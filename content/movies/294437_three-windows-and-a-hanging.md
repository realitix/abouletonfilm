A critical view of a society which survived the war, won its independence but still struggles with human equality. An insightful portrait of a Balkan village, of a patriarchal microcosm, and of its mayor who desperately wants to control the village life. Of husbands who feel forced to behave strong, but act against their own emotional interest. A reflection of rituals which not only show gender inequality, but also the absence of freedom of expression within the male community.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2Enlmk5heBkaSZJ6vcovXSYXEDp.jpg", "actors": ["Irena Cahani (Lushe)", "Luan Jaha (Uka)", "Donat Qosja (Sokol)", "Xhevat Qorraj (Alush)", "Leonora Mehmetaj (Nifa)", "Doresa Rexha (Drita)", "Mirjana Karanovi\u0107 (The journalist)", "Lyra Xhoci (The interpreter 1)", "Sindi Citaku (The interpreter 2)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
