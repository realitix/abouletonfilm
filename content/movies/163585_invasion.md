Everything in his big old mansion reminds him painfully of the years they spent together. One day several visitors turn up unexpectedly. They seem to be relatives of his deceased wife. In the beginning, the uninvited guests treat Joseph with loving care, but bit by bit the situation begins to change. The visitors slowly, almost unnoticably, become aggressive, even hostile, invaders. They try to get rid of Joseph and take over his house, his world, his thoughts. Is this just the paranoia of an old man or really a ruthless invasion?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lL18WPC8QIz4poJ4nR5VlUWxjer.jpg", "actors": ["Burghart Klau\u00dfner (Josef)", "Heike Trinker (Nina)", "Merab Ninidze (Konstantin)", "David Imper (Simon)", "Anna Wappel (Milena)", "Jasper Barwasser (Marco)", "Dmitry Brauer (Gast)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
