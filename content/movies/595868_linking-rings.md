By far his most personal work to date.  About the show - 'Houdini's right-hand man deals with the death of his boss. A half-century later, a Blackpool joke shop proprietor takes on a wide-eyed young protege. An affectionate look at a misspent youth and unsung heroes. Not a magic show, but magical nonetheless.'", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tDqpKKNoHk7rTCIU0gsSQO9jbpf.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Zenon (Himself/Jim Collins)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
