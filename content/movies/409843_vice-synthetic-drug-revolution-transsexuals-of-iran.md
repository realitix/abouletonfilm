VICE correspondent Hamilton Morris tracks these chemicals back to the Chinese factories where many are made, and meets the godfather of modern synthetic drugs at his remote lab in New Zealand. 'Transsexuals of Iran' -VICE follows the stories of homosexuals and transsexuals in Iran as they navigate a terrifying cultural landscape. When Ayatollah Khomeini came to power in 1979, he enforced strict Islamic custom that made homosexuality punishable by death. Surprisingly, though, the state treats transsexuals differently, allowing sexual reassignment surgery and in some cases even paying for it. Gay Iranians now face the agonizing choice of fleeing their communities or permanently changing who they are.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uWqJFhlzMTAwnIpraS8LV69A5Xx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "CGjOiUoSGt8"}
