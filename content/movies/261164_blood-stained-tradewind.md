Shing appears to have the winning edge; his gunfighting skills are unsurpassed earning him the nickname Golden Gun and the pretty daughter of the Triad boss appears to favor him more than eager brother Hsiong. But when Shing turns down his godfather\u2019s appointment to head the triad group his luck runs out and he\u2019s kicked out of the group and shunned by the family. Hsiong becomes the new boss and the pretty daughter marries him instead. Shing moves to Macau and becomes a common laborer and rooms with Carrie Ng and her small son. But Carrie\u2019s kid brother is a bad egg who brings the world of crime back into Shing\u2019s life. Then all hell breaks loose and everyone\u2019s life is in jeopardy when traitors and double crossers rise up and take over.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qj2SnKG0uJ86TCrZteLCblPZbCz.jpg", "actors": ["Stanley Fung (Drunk)", "Carrie Ng (Fang)", "Ng Man-Tat (Uncle Da)", "Waise Lee (Xiong)", "Alex Fong Chung-Sun (Chen Zhi Cheng)", "Lam Wai (Song Ben)", "Lo Lieh (Brother Ming)", "Chen Kuan-Tai (Arms buyer [cameo])"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
