A maniac breaks into the apartment of two sisters (Rei Akasaka, Megumi Kiyosato) and abuses them sexually and physically until they turn the tables. Like many American entries in the subgenre, the revenge scenes come off as a somewhat cynical attempt to justify the sadistic nature of what came before, while the rapes are clearly meant to entice the darker elements of the trenchcoat crowd. Kiriko Shimizu co-stars.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6CYAEAbXE6y3wpj1oExL0f3WNq.jpg", "actors": ["Rei Akasaka (Reiko Yumioka)", "Megumi Kiyosato (Ky\u00f4ko Yumioka / Reiko's Younger Sister)", "Isao Nonaka (Ry\u00f4hei Taki)", "Kazuyuki Senba (Yoshiaki Masaki)", "Kiriko Shimizu (Marie Tazaki)", "Akio Kaneda (Police Man)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
