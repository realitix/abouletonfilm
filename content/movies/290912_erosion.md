The protagonist of this unusual family story, Petunia Joe, lives in a house with his mother and grandfather. One day, he suddenly turns adult. Out in LIFE, he takes his first steps in the Factory. Meaningless work is performed and barren relationships are formed among the rusted walls.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7f39cNk8zbDhRPUdZOs9hBWsQ9f.jpg", "actors": ["R\u00f3bert Alf\u00f6ldi ()", "Lili Monori ()", "T\u00fcnde Mur\u00e1nyi ()", "Ir\u00e9n Psota ()", "Lajos Kov\u00e1cs ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
