Tuba (Hung) is a fainthearted cop who prefers to play in the brass section of the police band to pounding the streets.  One day, he finds himself caught up in an extortion case with trigger-happy detective Rambo Chow (David Chiang Da-wei). When Rambo gets fatally wounded, he makes a half-hearted vow to avenge his death.  Tuba is more than a little surprised when Rambo's spirit returns to make sure the timid cop makes good on his promise.  Backed up by his hotshot partner Cheung (Jacky Cheung Hok-yau), Tuba eventually summons the gumption to track down the baddies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zMJ8qGLQwyEt3zxxO6VZE4DDxS4.jpg", "actors": ["Sammo Hung (Officer Tuba)", "Jacky Cheung (Cheung)", "Joey Wong (Joanne)", "David Chiang (Sergeant Rambo Chow)", "Paul Chang Chung (Chung)", "Stanley Fung (Police band drummer)", "Wu Fung (Sau)", "Teddy Yip Wing-Cho (Joanne's father)", "Yuen Wah (Extortion gang member)", "Corey Yuen (Taoist priest in deity Chun Kui costume)", "Paul Chun Pui (Police band trumpet player)", "Tai Bo (Drug addict)", "Melvin Wong (Rambo's superior officer)", "Lam Ching-Ying (Taoist priest [cameo])"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [157887], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
