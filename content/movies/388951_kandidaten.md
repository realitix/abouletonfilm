Yannik is the leader of class 7a. Yousuf and Marcel would rather have him as a friend than as an enemy, otherwise they might end up like Emanuel. Sitting in a corner, unwanted and lonely, he gets beaten up regularly. But Emanuel shrugs off these offences and violations with surprising gentleness. All in one boat, the roles are firmly distributed. But when the teacher introduces the topics of democracy, ethics, and human rights to the class, Emanuel sees a chance to break free from his role as the underdog.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/giXA76TPszzP6bSePctPcLbcAr2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
