Using a system derived from techniques developed by the British architect and theorist Colin Rowe, Matta-Clark first divided the exterior wall of the house into nine equal grid-like sections. He then removed eight segments from the structure piece by piece, leaving the middle section of the grid intact. Bingo was filmed and edited primarily by Matta-Clark.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
