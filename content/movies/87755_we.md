It visualizes the words of Arundhati Roy, specifically her famous Come September speech, where she spoke on such things as the war on terror, corporate globalization, justice and the growing civil unrest.  We is almost in the style of a continuous music video. The music used sets the pace and serves as wonderful background for the words of Ms. Roy and images of humanity in the world we live all in today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hf4w8D4l8PMI5Wh2ubRyCCtGQiW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
