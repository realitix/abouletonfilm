He seduced his commoner house maid Okiku (Hibari). He promised that his love was no passing infatuation &amp; she would never suffer for it. She resisted his charms for some while knowing full well that they are of classes that do not intermarry, but in time he broke down her resistance, for how could she help but love him.  Political expedience puts the young hatamoto in the way of a marriage with a woman of his own station. This will cement family connections &amp; see his family safely through a crisis, at a time when many clans were finding themselves abolished on any pretext.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d0Q3fOBROsoLql1xIl4CcD2NL49.jpg", "actors": ["Hibari Misora (Okiku)", "Michiko Hoshi (Chizuru)", "Satomi Oka ()", "Yoshiko Yashioji ()", "S\u00f4ji Kiyokawa ()", "Ushio Akashi ()", "Yuji Kamishiro ()", "Reiji Tsumura ()", "Masao Hori ()", "Chiyonosuke Azuma (Harima Aoyama)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
