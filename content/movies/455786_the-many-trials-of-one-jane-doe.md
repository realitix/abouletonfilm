Wendy Crewson stars as Jane Doe (as she must legally be called), a woman who discovers she was the fifth victim of a serial rapist terrorizing a two-block area surrounding her home. When she learns that the police department was aware of this dangerous criminal yet decided not to issue a public warning, she feels that she and all the women in the neighbourhood were offered up as bait. Driven to take action, she investigates not only her own case, but also police procedures with regard to rape and its victims, and is shocked by what she discovers: a legal system that is sexist and uncaring. It is then that she decides to take on the Toronto Police Department. What follows for Jane Doe is a grueling 10-year legal battle, which becomes vicious, all-consuming and personal.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rZpz3WXZWCTpd9fwmUHZjRKT3fi.jpg", "actors": ["Wendy Crewson (Jane Doe)", "Steven Mackintosh (Sean Dewart)", "Sarah Constible (Cynthia Petersen)", "Jacob Tierney (Eric Golden)", "Gary Lewis (Jeremy Sharp)", "Eric Peterson (Dr. Daniels)", "Kristen Holden-Ried (Harold Beckwith)", "Janet Bailey (Cheri)", "Matt Cooke (Detective James Barry)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
