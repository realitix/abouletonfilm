It's well paced, well played, well sung. Jonas Kaufmann is an ideal Tito. His voice is not only beautiful and flexible, it's also ample, retaining warmth and sweetness when he sings out. The character of Tito is too good to be true, but Kaufmann makes him intense, noble, and beliveable. Vesselina Kasarova is riviting as Sesto. Her voice is gorgeous and multi-colored, her technique exquisite, her immersion in the role complete.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vSRtHcoq6YoDTjPuzURh4Aw2hBI.jpg", "actors": ["Jonas Kaufmann (Tito Vespasiano)", "Eva Mei (Vitellia)", "Vesselina Kasarova (Sesto)", "Malin Hartelius (Servilia)", "Liliana Nikiteanu (Annio)", "G\u00fcnther Groissb\u00f6ck (Publio)", "Franz Welser-M\u00f6st (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
