Thornton represents the outside world with archival footage of rugged terrain and industrial wastelands. We are introduced to the post-apocalyptic room where the children act and re-enact a disjointed play on media narratives. Though the seemingly isolated room is furnished with typically domestic objects, in the hands of the \"children raised on television\" these items appear as props for the purpose of performing adult affectation. Peggy and Fred channel their isolation like open radios, as if boredom were the frequency from which media is transmitted.\r - Description from EAI", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oT9CidXnjkI03tIm7Qy4TbAhDdn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
