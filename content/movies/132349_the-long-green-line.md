Along with mastery of their sport, Newton turns boys into men, who carry his teaching and his love for each of them throughout their lives. The Long Green Line documents the York Duke's 2005 Cross Country season as the runners seek their record 25th state title in 50 years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rcQ0SfFMwhBnc2jnn6xpT4lEpSA.jpg", "actors": ["Joe Newton (Himself)", "Charlie Kern (Himself)", "Eric Dettman (Himself)", "Matt Dettman (Himself)", "David Montgomery (Himself)", "Lionel Montenegro (Himself)", "Nick Kuczwara (Himself)", "Michael Fry (Himself)", "Tim Jung (Himself)", "Ron Stefani (Himself)", "John Fisher (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
