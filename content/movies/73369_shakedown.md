On the strength of his sheer tenacity, he gets a job with a major newspaper, and it's not long before he's made a name for himself by charming a notorious crime boss (Brian Donlevy) into allowing himself to be photographed. Donlevy takes him under his wing, but Duff decides to bite the hand that feeds him and sets Donlevy and another crime boss, Lawrence Tierney, against one another. He uses photos to blackmail Tierney into providing him with a steady income while he sidles up to Donlevy's wife on the sly, all the while romancing the photo editor of the paper at which he works.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6uypkyJdEptXjfz7QBphbsBNVOp.jpg", "actors": ["Howard Duff (Jack Early)", "Brian Donlevy (Nick Palmer)", "Peggy Dow (Ellen Bennett)", "Lawrence Tierney (Harry Colton)", "Bruce Bennett (David Glover)", "Anne Vernon (Nita Palmer (as Ann Vernon))", "Charles Sherlock (Sam, Colton's Henchman)", "Rock Hudson (Ted, the Night Club Doorman)", "Peggie Castle (Hat Check Girl)", "Joseph Pevney (Keller the Reporter)", "Chester Conklin (Chet (uncredited))", "John Miller (Brownie (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [85346, 51878, 46101, 90040], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
