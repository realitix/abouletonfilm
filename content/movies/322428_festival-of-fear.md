Keum-ji grew up under much abuse while she watched her twin sister, Mi-kyung, receives all their parents' love. Her resentment is strong. Keum-ji develops a high level of concentration until it grows into a supernatural power which she uses to try to find her life. One day, Keum-ji has some plastic surgery done. She looks like Mi-kyung but Mi-kyung ends up looking hideous like Keum-ji once did. The two twin sisters are psychologically and physically linked, sharing a single fate. With their mother, Hye-won, begging her husband to return Mi-kyung to her former self, the husband is very conflicted but chooses Mi-kyung in the end.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eLvivzp5ogKkJZeUjd4idUje6PV.jpg", "actors": ["Ma Hung-sik ()", "Cheon Eun-gyeong ()", "Park Ki-teak ()", "Nam Su-Jung ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
