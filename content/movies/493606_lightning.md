{"tmdb_id": 493606, "title": "Lightning", "original_title": "Lightning", "slug_title": "lightning", "date": "1976-07-09", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "\"When I look for the lightning, it never strikes. When I look away, it does.\"  Filmed inside a car, this tape focuses on observation of natural phenomena, presenting the obverse of the \"If a tree falls in the woods...\" conundrum. Does observation change the course of events? Can you believe in things you don't see? In this experiment, the camera occupies a privileged position showing the woman and what she sees, as well as what she cannot see.  Filmmaker Deborah Stratman cites \"Lightning\" as an influence, saying \"This video seems to me in some small way what the magic of filmmaking is all about.\"", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
