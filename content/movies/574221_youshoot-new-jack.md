We said \"ask anything.\" New Jack is in the vaunted YouShoot hotseat and he's having a blast! No, wait...he's pissed! No, he's happy again...ugh!  Live the highs and lows with us as we bring you another uncensored, unscripted, unapologetic exploitation of the very concept of the shoot-style interview.  We hand the interview over to you in the YouShoot and the show is yours! Also, there's an awesome bonus feature where New Jack, Mustafa and Jim Cornette meet and talk out their Smokey Mountain issues. It was unplanned and unexpected, but it happened before our cameras. Only on YouShoot!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Sean Oliver (Himself)", "Jerome Young (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
