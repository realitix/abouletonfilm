He posts a $5 reward, which the rats change to $5,000. Alice and Julius accept the challenge; they play a tune and the rats gather around, but they won't fall for the old \"follow me into the river\" trick. Fortunately, a very powerful vacuum cleaner is nearby, and Alice and Julius suck all the rats into it. The king gives them their reward: $5.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aP2nH5tvHSoBkpRRAyCGiGcSuKi.jpg", "actors": ["Virginia Davis (Alice)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
