This period martial arts mystery stars Damian Lau Chung-yan as Lu Tien-chun, an imprisoned swordsman, accused of killing three men. Lu probably would have already been executed for his crimes but is kept alive because he knows the whereabouts of some hidden gold, a secret the ruthless, one-eyed warden Hsiung Chien repeatedly tries to torture out of him. Escaping with the help of a fellow inmate (Lau Kong), Lu encounters maiden Yu Pei-pei (played by a very young Cherie Chung Chor-hung) who is travelling to pick up her father's ashes in Stone Town. When she sees a wanted poster featuring Lu, Pei-pei realizes that he was the man responsible for her father's murder. Lu gives the girl a chance to take revenge and, when she hesitates, he relates his recollections of what really happened on the night of the man's death. The true location of the gold remains a mystery to Lu and one of the three actual thieves appears to still be alive.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x3MZ8tsBIPw5TA8duJWLLnQv4HP.jpg", "actors": ["Damian Lau (Lo Tien-Kwan)", "Cherie Chung (Yao Puipui)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
