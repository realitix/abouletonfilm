He goes to stay with his wealthy Aunt Florence in hopes that she will write him into her will. When a nasty creditor makes it clear that Tom is out of time, he devises a plan with Elodie, the undertaker's daughter, to rob the graves of the rich townspeople buried in the cemetery across the road. After plundering the graves, Tom arrives back at Florence's house and events take a dark turn. Tom begins hearing and seeing strange things that seem to coincide with the deaths of the people he robbed. Even more disconcerting... he appears to be the only one sensing the occurrences. One question lingers: Is Tom's conscience playing a trick on him... or is he really being haunted by those he stole from?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2K7cf89NePNANFm9IyTAGyeKUkO.jpg", "actors": ["Michelle Krusiec (Elodie)", "Aaron Schwartz (Benji)", "David Chokachi (Sheriff Alex Burrows)", "Jamie Bernadette (Deputy Ella Kade)", "Maria Olsen (Aunt Florence)", "Cynthia Bravo (The Bride)", "Gareth Koorzen (Tom)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
