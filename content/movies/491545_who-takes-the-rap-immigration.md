The film describes how different groups of immigrants arrived for work in the UK, only to find increasingly restrictive laws, which kept them in low-paid, unskilled work and identified them as \u2018undesirable.\u2019 Footage of the Garners\u2019 Steak House strike and the Grunwick strike is included to show how these workers fought back against racism. Specific laws are examined, and the film includes interviews with a number of immigrant women. The voices of two female rappers provide commentary throughout.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
