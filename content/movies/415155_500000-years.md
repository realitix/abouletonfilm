But in an odd circumstance (though not that odd because it's Thailand), the site has been largely forgotten and now only villagers pay a visit to perform a rite of offering to the ancestral spirits. It seems Chai Siris is exploring the supernatural and science, as well as the idea of death and rebirth brought about by the act of cinema-making.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iKSnNmtjj07J0poq5RhZWU8p2yg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
