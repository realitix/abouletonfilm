It was an era of psychological blowback from the sudden, shocking death of his wife in 1964, an era that had produced the cut-up \u2018condensed novels\u2019 of Atrocity plus a series of strange collages and \u2018advertisers\u2019 announcements\u2019. [\u2026] After Freud\u2019s exploration within the psyche it is now the outer world of reality which must be quantified and eroticised.\u2019 Later there were further literary experiments, concrete poems and \u2018impressionistic\u2019 film reviews, and an aborted multimedia theatrical play based around car crashes. After that came an actual gallery exhibition of crashed cars, replete with strippers and the drunken destruction of the \u2018exhibits\u2019 by an enraged audience.\u201d (from: http://aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh.blogspot.de/2013/01/short-film-adaptation-of-jg-ballards.html)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gvHWxcihnWI3OGEvat2yMGi11d0.jpg", "actors": ["J.G.
