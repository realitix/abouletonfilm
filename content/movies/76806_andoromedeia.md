It is a commercial movie with very few artistic ambitions, but a well made example of the endless possibilities of the revolutionary internet back in the nineties, as perceived by the mainstream and media. \r\n\r\nThe movie is a teenage adventure/action movie and relationship drama and throws in a little bit of everything cyber. There are the nineties cyberpunk hackerspace with tubing and snaking cables, there is an evil technological corporation (Digital Ware Japan, co. inc.), there are baddies in black suits, there is a magically, eh, electronically remote controlled Volkswagen beetle by a gamepad, there are glass tetris blocks in cyberspace... And even a boy band number dancing on a stage with flaming ventilation pipes and circuit boards. Note that all of these are in the passing and the main plot revolves around the girl who has been reanimated (heh) into a digital clone by her father after her untimely death, exiled to the laptop of her crush.\r\n\r\nWhile technically nonsensical and generally absolutely ridiculous, it does still have good pacing and is a good ride of surfing on the wave of cyber cheese."}], "recommandations_id": []}
