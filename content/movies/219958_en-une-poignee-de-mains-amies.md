In less than five minutes, the project was constructed: Mano\u00ebl was writing a poem that we will film with our friends Bernard, J\u00e9r\u00f4me, and Fran\u00e7ois. And our dreams of childhood were made in less than a week by going back and forth to the banks of Douro, on foot, then by car, then in a helicopter, back to where we were following these marvelous clouds, with Mano\u00ebl and me screaming stanzas of a poem inspired by the wind, the water, and friendship.\" -  Jean Rouch", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tn9UdvG4pYjN91w9vRHsQLwvMY4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
