The soldier leaves the army with the girl, and goes back to his village. The arrival of the Tamil girl into this predominantly Sinhala village causes a stir within the community, where they collectively decide to send her to a refugee camp. \"This is My Moon\" is a controversial examination of village life, where rural myths are shattered to reveal a deeper reality of a society torn apart by war.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ufGsb2vo40mjAxWQFNAwKtF7gaI.jpg", "actors": ["Saumya Liyanage (Soldier)", "Dilhani Ekanayake (Tamil Woman)", "Jagath Chamila (Prospective soldier)", "Jayasiri Chandrajith ()", "Naditha Dinesh (Brother in law of dead soldier)", "Kaushalaya Fernando (Widow of a soldier)", "Sunil Hettiarachchi ()", "Anoma Janadari ()", "W.
