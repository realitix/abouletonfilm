Underground trains, streetcars, buses and escalators embody the impressionistic beauty of architectural reflections like moving paintings. The face of the city is rendered as a light-infused intersection of people, glass, and concrete. Part 1 takes place underground, with an audio collage mixed from ambient recordings of subway stations and trains. Part 2 takes place above ground and features an original score with gamelans, guitar loops, sampled car door locks and brake pumps. \u2013 KPR", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eSek6Qd9lceTjyY9LiBENcypDre.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
