We were very ambitious with this film, the script was the best part about it, the story is actually really compelling, where the film lacks is within the technicality of the production. We were just a bunch of friends coming together to make this movie and release it and that's exactly what we did. It works for what it is, and the memory's that come out of making a film like this are so great, staying up all night editing to have it done for the morning. What a thrill. I look back and see how much I've grown as a story teller and a director, maybe one day I will recreate this film with actors that will fit the age of who we intended to be playing these roles."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
