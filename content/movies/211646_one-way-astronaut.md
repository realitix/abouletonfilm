Stephan, Sara, Henri and Beatriz are 4 people who, like tens of thousands of applicants from all over the world, say they are willing to spend the rest of their lives on Mars. It is the story of Mars One and its founder Bas Lansdorp in the early stages. Space experts answer questions about the likelihood of Mars One succeeding and discuss the kind of risks the astronauts will be taking.
