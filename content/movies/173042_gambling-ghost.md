The film is just absurd. The very name suggests that it is better to pass by this \"masterpiece of cinema\". However, as a true casino fan, I was not able to pass this movie. It seems to me that it would be easier to get an <a href=\"http://www.breakingnewsweek.com/\">online casino bonus</a>  than to watch this movie to the end. I understand that this is a pretty old movie, but there are many older films that do not cause such negative emotions when viewed. Of course, this is just my subjective opinion."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
