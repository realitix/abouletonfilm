For years I thought I had made a film-poem, without knowing how to explain it, until Gilles Deleuze created the concept of \"perception-image\":\r A character acts on the screen and it is assumed to see the world in a certain way. But simultaneously the camera sees him, and sees his world from another point of view which thinks, reflects, and transforms the viewpoint of the character [...]. In short, perception-image finds its status, as free indirect subjective, from the moment that it reflects its content in a camera-consiousness which has become autonomous ('cinema of poetry').\r (Gilles Deleuze, Cinema I: The Movement-Image).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aXHj5J8poQL9R4SXtB19QZf6SsQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
