Israeli bombing during this episode razed 50 villages and left half a million civilians homeless, causing a flood of refugees into Beirut.  Many of those who fled south Lebanon have not returned, choosing instead to live a scavenging existence in bombed-out buildings in the capital, where they\u2019re out of range of the Israeli-occupied \u201csecurity zone\u201d in the south.  Through Leila\u2019s relationship with her family and the women and children of the surrounding villages, we get to know the hopes and dreams of the people who have remained in south Lebanon as they work to rebuild their homes and their lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cdmGWHN84LLcLXvMe2xTpPQPrO4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
