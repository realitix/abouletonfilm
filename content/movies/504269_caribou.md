Structurally it is a journey from the forests of northern Saskatchewan to the Badlands in the south. It is the final part in a series of North American landscape films and videos that I have been shooting for the past few years. Caribou is essentially a video about mortality, death, decay, notions of beauty, and a respect for the natural world. It is grounded in the detail of our surroundings, and the beauty that resonates from these hidden places.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8EFLoETWOAGY9uUoj04gPh3JDvr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
