A lifelong outcast, Casey learned at a young age to channel his brutal urges into sports, but after being kicked off the local hockey team for excessive force during practice, Casey moves back in with his worrisome mother to seek solace at his boyhood home. His retreat is soon interrupted though when a vicious gang of street punks, the Purple Dragons, savagely beat him with pipes for attempting to remove their graffiti. After narrowly escaping the encounter with his life, Casey vows to single-handedly rid his neighborhood of crime. Armed with a golf bag loaded with clubs and sporting a fearful hockey mask, Casey stalks the alleyways by night, mercilessly trouncing any delinquents unlucky enough to cross his path. The misguided crusader soon goes off the deep end, and an unlikely ally from the sewers is forced to intervene before the vigilante annihilates every criminal in the city.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aD9f7S5C3gd2tfrszQ1XGENJbex.jpg", "actors": ["Hilarion Banks (Casey Jones)", "Robbie Rist (Michelangelo (voice))", "Moira Wilson (Mrs. Jones)", "Brian Villalobos (Dragon Face / Raphael (voice))", "Polaris Banks (Sid Jones / Donatello (voice))", "Savannah Welch (April O'Neil)", "Chris Frasier (Michaelangelo / Krang (voice))", "Marty Moreno (Michaelangelo / Pizza Man)", "Josh Yawn (Leonardo (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [204761, 78088, 177112, 191094], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
