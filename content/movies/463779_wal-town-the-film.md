Filmed over 2 summers, these young crusaders (plus a gonzo journalist) try to raise public awareness about Wal-Mart's business practices and their effect on cities and towns across Canada. With youthful passion and often hilarious cultural jams, this film takes us to the frontlines of the ongoing debate over the company's increasing dominance in the Canadian retail market.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uZ842Uwy7QvSbT0iwG5Tb40Pc0I.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
