Thomsen gives an account of brief memories of childhood in a deliberately \"staged\" fashion, but more particularly of his experience of writing and on the art of reading aloud, and likewise describing poetry in general as a balance between emotion and cognition.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fZf4wFjXdbxwZFJMbEyZNFjPLJK.jpg", "actors": ["S\u00f8ren Ulrik Thomsen (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
