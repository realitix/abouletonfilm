Stolen by crusaders on the night of his birth, he has no knowledge of his bloodline: his mother a demon; father a vampire. Trained and exploited by a brotherhood of mystic monks to slay all enemies of the church, fate brings him back one night to the castle of his father, armed with the monster-slaying Sword of Laertes, to destroy the vampire Vladislas and reclaim a holy relic: the Bloodstone. The events of that night turn Radu from a noble man into a vampire with no master, setting him on a centuries-long quest for sustenance, for companionship, for the treacherous one who stole him from the sun, and for the Bloodstone he hopes will bring him peace.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jjUneOAXsN9e9WbiNU6A9iJtsU3.jpg", "actors": ["Anders Hove ()", "Denice Duff ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
