In her Chelsea Hotel apartment, home for over thirty years, she patches together her journeys, from apartheid's 'pattern of brokenness', to a chance meeting and recording with Duke Ellington in Paris, to making a life in New York. The narrative of her journeys are inter-woven with her music and the musings of folks who know her work. Like her haunting song, Windsong, the film is a meditation on displacement, exile and belonging.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7JHNg9DgSF90IN3cqJhxPSIXSxx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
