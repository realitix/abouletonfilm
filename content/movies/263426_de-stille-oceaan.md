Marian is a journalist who has been working in Latin America and who arrives home just after her father dies to find out that the man she had married for purely political reasons might be deported because the authorities found out he was not living with her. Meanwhile, Marian is upset that her mother and sister are keeping her mentally handicapped brother in an institution, and she goes there to get him released into her custody -- a mistake it turns out. He is actually worse off with her, and vice-versa. On top of everything, Marian cannot break away from the depression she feels over a tragic incident that happened while she was in Latin America -- and anything she does is colored by that moment from the past. These burdens become almost too much to bear, both for Marian and the viewers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pikwjFryVLGjctaSRlr7B3wZtdh.jpg", "actors": ["Josse De Pauw (Emil Winters)", "Johan Leysen (Jan Verstraete)", "Julien Schoenaerts (Frits Rosmeyer)", "Andrea Domburg (Emilia Winters)", "Jos\u00e9e Ruiter (Marian Winters)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
