Historian Dr. Lucy Worsley, Chief Curator at Historic Royal Palaces, reveals that it has always been this way. Exploring the royal wardrobes of our kings and queens over the last four hundred years, Lucy shows this isn't just a public fascination, but an important and powerful message from the monarchs. From Elizabeth I to the present Queen Elizabeth II, Lucy explains how the royal wardrobe's significance goes far beyond the cut and color of the clothing. Royal fashion is, and has always been, regarded as a very personal statement to reflect their power over the reign. Most kings and queens have carefully choreographed every aspect of their wardrobe; for those who have not, there have sometimes been calamitous consequences. As much today as in the past, royal fashion is as much about politics as it is about elegant attire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gCFVsDVYwar9D1CswEOWgdTVRhO.jpg", "actors": ["Lucy Worsley (Herself - Presenter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
