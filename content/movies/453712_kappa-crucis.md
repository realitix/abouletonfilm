This discreet man begins his day by listening to the messages left on his answering machine (\u201cBernardo, have you seen the latest images of Pluto?\u201d), to birdsongs, or to Beethoven. He makes telescopes, polishes lenses, gets annoyed with administrative hassles or sits on the terrace in order to \u201cfloat in space\u201d with the help of his binoculars.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cs5uwXVFvSVCkLESk7Z0tFHt6FB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
