When the 200,000-plus feet of film he eventually exposed in Mexico was first attempted to be made into a feature film, \"Thunder Over Mexico\", the producers excluded the Death Day material for subsequent compilation as an independent short subject.  Silent with music track and explanatory English intertitles.  This is apparently a lost film per se, although the raw footage from which it was made has survived.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iCmtAuuWyiPxYrwBRX7a6kehJYv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
