Instead, This Is Horror (copyright 1989) was a TV special which ran in four 60 minute increments. This new special used some framing footage from the original 'World of Horror' but is primarily newer interviews and behind-the-scenes footage about what was hot in horror in the late 80s. Here in the U.S., a condensed 90-minute version made its way onto video courtesy of Goodtimes in 1990. Elsewhere, the entire special was released as 2 different tapes running 90 minutes apiece. In the UK these were titled This is Horror: A Video Encyclopedia of Horror (Volumes 1 and 2) and in Germany they were called Best of Stephen King's World of Horror (Parts 1 & 2).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gPx8yWBuAF8CGXY7mYbcUk0yezn.jpg", "actors": ["Stephen King (Himself)", "Henry Strozier (Narrator (voice))", "Dario Argento (Himself)", "Charles Band (Himself)", "Clive Barker (Himself)", "Robert Bloch (Himself)", "William Butler (Himself)", "Jeff Burr (Himself)", "John Carpenter (Himself)", "Ethan Coen (Himself)", "Joel Coen (Himself)", "Wes Craven (Himself)", "Frank Darabont (Himself)", "Kane Hodder (Himself)", "Kate Hodge (Herself)", "Bill Johnson (Himself)", "Steve Johnson (Himself)", "Lloyd Kaufman (Himself)", "Bob Keen (Himself)", "John Landis (Himself)", "Geoffrey Portass (Himself)", "Linnea Quigley (Herself)", "Sam Raimi (Himself)", "Fred Olen Ray (Himself)", "Suzanne Parker Sanders (Herself)", "Brian Yuzna (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
