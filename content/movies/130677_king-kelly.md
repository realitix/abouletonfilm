Kelly\u2019s name is well known among the visitors of (in)appropriate online portals. The two teenagers digitally record anything and everything that crosses their paths and upload the results to the internet. But, today is not their day: Kelly\u2019s ex-boyfriend has taken her car containing a package she was not to lose under any circumstances. While searching for it, the two set off on a peculiar journey through a night peppered with drugs, sex, corrupt police officers and other catastrophes \u2013 and always with their trusty mobiles in hand.  Made entirely using mobile phone cameras, KING KELLY is a satirical journey through the boundless narcissism of the YouTube generation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tZ4rkXHdJqp8pVcZ1y6apkoPR9m.jpg", "actors": ["Louisa Krause (Kelly)", "Libby Woodbridge (Jordan)", "Roderick Hill (Poo Bare)", "Will Brill (Ryan)", "Jonny Orsini (Matt)", "Joey Auzenne (Drug Dealer)", "Aaron Cassara (Tom)", "Ash Christian (Dean)", "Beth Dzuricky (Mom)", "Jen Ponton (Angela)", "Joseph Reiver (Troy)", "Micah Stock (Josh)", "Patrick Murney (Chad)", "Dion Sapp (Man on Street #1)", "Ian Eaton (Man on Street #2)", "Ramsey Faragallah (Liquor Store Clerk)", "Emily Fleischer (Girl at Fire)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "31MMErlMZnA"}
