During the Soviet rule artists who stay true to their vision are executed, sent to mental hospitals or Gulags.  Their plight inspires young Igor Savitsky. He pretends to buy state-approved art but instead daringly rescues 40,000 forbidden fellow artist's works and creates a museum in the desert of Uzbekistan, far from the watchful eyes of the KGB. Though a penniless artist himself, he cajoles the cash to pay for the art from the same authorities who are banning it. Savitsky amasses an eclectic mix of Russian Avant-Garde art. But his greatest discovery is an unknown school of artists who settle in Uzbekistan after the Russian revolution of 1917, encountering a unique Islamic culture, as exotic to them as Tahiti was for Gauguin. They develop a startlingly original style, fusing European modernism with centuries-old Eastern traditions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qbnDE8UVhP4bWYpR8CbrI0GTHB5.jpg", "actors": ["Ed Asner (Voice)", "Sally Field (Voice)", "Ben Kingsley (Voice)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
