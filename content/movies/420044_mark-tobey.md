It is only the second film made by Robert Gardner and tries to show in cinematic language how this man looked at the world; Mark Tobey himself both performs and is observed. A unique film in the Gardner ouvre, the film not only presents an experimental portrait of Tobey but serves as a window into the American art, avant garde film and poetic movements of this period.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zmsyHfLhHKFVoEvy0Rw46VKeauS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
