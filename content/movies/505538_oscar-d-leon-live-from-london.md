Between 1985 and 1987 D\u2019Le\u00f3n issued a succession of albums featuring some of his strongest material, inspired playing and assured arrangements, which justified his position as one of salsa\u2019s true international stars. The definitive albums of this period were 1987\u2019s Riquiti..! and La Salsa Soy Yo. In June and October 1988, D\u2019Le\u00f3n demonstrated his live reputation by playing three sell-out concerts at London\u2019s Hackney Empire. The last was recorded and broadcast in 1989 as a programme in BBC television\u2019s Rhythms Of The World world music series, then released as Oscar D\u2019Le\u00f3n Live, the first salsa video to be issued in the UK.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pLM2v2WA5eNFQlb5aKYtRLnwZWj.jpg", "actors": ["Oscar D' Le\u00f3n (Oscar D' Le\u00f3n)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "PApxzNYgPAk"}
