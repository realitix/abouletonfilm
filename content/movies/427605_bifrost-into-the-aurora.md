The artists document their collaborations with international institutions, both educational and private enterprise, and individuals alike in an attempt to send cutting edge imaging equipment into heart of the Aurora at an altitude of approximately 300 km. The film chronicles their successes and challenges provoking conversations concerning how we as a society define achievement, while addressing humankind's pensive effort to coax the marriage between faith (mythology, religion) and empirical evidence.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Eric Adamsons (Himself)", "Heins Kim (Himself)", "Sam\u00fael Hjaltal\u00edn (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
