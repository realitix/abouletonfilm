Deemed too \u2018inappropriate\u2019 and \u2018morally corrupting\u2019 for Australian eyes, these scenes were hacked from feature films and locked away in government archives. When young Sydney Film Festival director David Stratton attempted to program a Swedish film that the censors believed contained ACTUAL sex, a scandal erupted. In a mash-up of never-before-seen banned clippings, SMUT HOUNDS tells the story of how seventy-seven seconds of celluloid scandalised a government and transformed Australian cinema.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yoOSTjNsPdnd6shvM81f4y61Zdc.jpg", "actors": ["David Stratton (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
