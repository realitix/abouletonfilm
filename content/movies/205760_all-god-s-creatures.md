When night falls, this seeming everyman savagely kills \"filthy women\" as his social outlet. A chance encounter with Delia, a young prostitute searching for an escape from her troubled past, forces Jon to confront the most terrifying thing he has ever faced in all his dark affairs - himself. All God's Creatures examines the true nature of what it means to be a monster and reveals that love is not only for a chosen few, but for all God's creatures.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q5oPVZ5HWzUzpdGZ5WGCZGz7qly.jpg", "actors": ["Linda Elena Tovar (Hipster Girl)", "Carson Grant (Don)", "Ginger Kroll (Jeanie)", "Josh Folan (Jon)", "Molly Fahey (Kira)", "Jessica Sherr (Coffee Shop Patron #2)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
