They're almost always going to get a pretty middling rating. There will almost always be good ones in the mix, and there will almost always be bad ones in the mix. The good ones often leave you disappointed that they're over so fast, and the bad ones are often not so bad solely because they're mercifully short, so again, usually, they cancel one another out for an average experience. _Galaxy of Horrors_ fits this formula to a tee, and as low budget as it is, I don't regret having seen it.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"}], "recommandations_id": [111476, 103071, 434520, 204607]}
