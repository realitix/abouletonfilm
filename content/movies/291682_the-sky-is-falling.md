Her first novel is rejected, her non-committal boy friend decides to take a powder, her best friend moves to Mexico for an acting job, and her mother announces that her long presumed dead father is actually a hippie photographer who has come to town to meet her. Sinking into a depression at being a total failure at 28, she starts fantasizing about suicide. In her depths of despair she meets various eccentric characters including a chain-smoking Santa Claus and an obnoxious literary agent. But her belief in herself is only restored when she meets a patient in a hospital where she does volunteer work.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hHxhjqeL2k8pm4w4WfTF6srx1HQ.jpg", "actors": ["Dedee Pfeiffer ()", "Laura Leighton ()", "Teri Garr ()", "Howard Hesseman ()", "Bert Remsen ()", "Lorraine Toussaint ()", "Octavia Spencer (Nurse #2)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "rYefH6etTv4"}
