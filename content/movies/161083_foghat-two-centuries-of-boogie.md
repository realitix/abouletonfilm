This DVD documents one of the last performances of the legendary original Foghat line up of Dave, Rod Price, Roger Earl, and Tony Stevens that toured almost constantly through the 1970s and 1980s, ripping through all their signature hits like \"I Just Want to Make Love to You,\" \"Slow Ride,\" and \"Fool For the City.\" Amazingly, even as a century ended and another began, the band's and especially Dave's passion for the music never waned and the concert captured on tape is as fitting a tribute as any to the enduring Foghat legacy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/QmrNtzUoYMxAn8FH5WcHbB6OaH.jpg", "actors": ["Dave Peverett (Guitar Vocals)", "Tony Stevens (Bass)", "Rod Price (Guitar)", "Roger Earl (Drums)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
