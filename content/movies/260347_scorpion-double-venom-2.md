Nami is certainly no great action heroine, and the plot at times makes little sense, climaxing with a coincidence more ridiculous than any Shakespeare ever used. For complicated reasons, Nami uses her medical knowledge to break into a women's prison as staff physician. There, as in the previous movie, the convicts wind up naked awfully frequently.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2fMPMoQVNke7KJJZwhjtCLBtHif.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
