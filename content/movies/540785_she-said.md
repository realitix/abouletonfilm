The film begins with a series of old and contemporary photographs, cut to a rhythm, which echoes that of monotony. A fragmented dialogue creates a feeling of alienation and lack of control (often identified with the labour process), interrupting further sequences of live action and images. \u201cFeeling strongly that women's work is continuous, I realised that the film work could only be seen after work or in moments of non-work which I hesitate to call leisure. With this in mind I tried to bring this contradiction to the surface within the film itself\u201d' (Susan Stein)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3LseYAUWsj6v5M2AqtRtUk5Ne1o.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
