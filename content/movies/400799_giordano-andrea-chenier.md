Nicholas Joel\u2019s production is extremely elegant while at the same time being simple and uncluttered. Act I, for example, is dominated by an enormous gilt-framed mirror precariously tilted. I assume that it is a metaphor for the imminent downfall of the decadent aristocracy at the party given by the Contessa di Coigny. The costumes designs by Hubert Monloup are terrific. The prerevolutionary costumes in Act I are simply stunning each one individually tailored for the choristers and major performers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7ozIMTetBuBs4broKTbrx3bPEVY.jpg", "actors": ["Luciano Pavarotti (Andrea Chenier)", "Maria Guleghina (Maddalena di Coigny)", "Juan Pons (Gerard)", "Wendy White (Bersi)", "Stephanie Blythe (Madelon)", "Judith Christin (Contessa di Coigny)", "Haijing Fu (Roucher)", "Christopher Schaldenbrand (Pietro Fl\u00e9ville)", "Yannis Yannissis (Fouquier-Tinville)", "Paul Plishka (Mathieu)", "Michel S\u00e9n\u00e9chal (Incredible)", "Richard Vernon (Schmidt)", "Jeffrey Wells (Dumas)", "James Levine (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
