He is forbidden to confess his love for fear of displeasing him because of his hunchback and his one-eyed eye. As Moulay Driss can not even hope to seduce Yacout, he decides to help Moulay Ali, his best friend, to conquer her. Moulay Driss begins writing fiery letters to Yacout on behalf of Ali. At times, hidden behind a tree, he recites them himself to a subjugated Yacut.
