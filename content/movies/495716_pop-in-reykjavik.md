I loved the music, but as an English-speaker with no subtitles on the version I watched, I felt I was missing out on a huge part of the film. This was especially apparent in a scene where the host was suddenly in a club dancing with topless women for seemingly no reason that I was aware of. Hopefully in the future I can watch this with subtitles or learn the language to better enjoy this documentary; but for now, Pop in Reykjavik gets a middling score from me."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
