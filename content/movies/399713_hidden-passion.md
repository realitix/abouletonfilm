Her young slutty niece, who dresses provocatively wearing thigh high boots, comes to stay with them. There is a nerdy young neighbour who lusts after our Mrs Robinson and of course the ubiquitous local shop keeper who lusts after our young hero for some unknown reason and is a chunky Korean looking actress. The movie is set in the boondocks of HK away from the picturesque city towers that we come to associate with all HK crime melodramas and moves toward ts inevitable finale.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/neNjaGSyVxCcMpvVHO0k0XBeaJw.jpg", "actors": ["Asuka Tamami (Pauline)", "Ng Jan-Wai (Chu)", "Lau Wai-Han (Aunt Nan)", "Chun Hung (Mrs Chou)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
