Worst Case Scenario starts out as a series of still photographs depicting daily life on a Viennese street corner. The film re-orders and manipulates a selection of these images, and as it progresses the static world slowly and subtly comes to life. As Sigmund Freud casts his long shadow across the city, an increasingly improbable chain of events and relationships starts to emerge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lfblmeNBF7bTj8dqrMhhwtxDVDn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
