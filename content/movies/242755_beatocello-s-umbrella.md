Revered as a national hero, Richner's Herculean efforts have saved the lives of millions of Cambodia's children over the past 20 years, some who have grown up to serve as doctors in his state-of- the-art pediatric hospitals. Now at 64 , Richner continues to practice medicine and travel the world concertizing and singing about his protective red umbrella, which has come to symbolize the health and hope he brought to a grateful nation. Unlike many of his contemporaries who held utopian world views, Beat Richner is one of the few who worked to made his vision a reality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d5aWgyqzknSp7s8OALQiQYnYpTG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
