These brothers are not particularly exceptional as people go, but at least they have branched out into separate vocations in their lives. One brother is a doctor, another is a criminal, and the third is a bus driver. Like others in Europe, they suffered through World War II, yet no matter what their backgrounds and experiences, their interpersonal relationships are not exactly gripping drama.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/47Axwk1krf4YmjwJa2YhGMHMmPJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
