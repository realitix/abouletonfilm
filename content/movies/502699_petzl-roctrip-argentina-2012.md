Lying just to the north, the majestic 200-meter monolith  La Buitrera Canyon was home to the 10th anniversary Petzl RocTrip in November 2012. For more than a week, climbers from all over the world came together to share a common passion: climbing. Thanks to the hard work of a team of Argentinean and international route developers, La Buitrera Canyon, 5 km long with towering cliffs up to 200m high, is now one of Argentina's major climbing spots. For the tenth edition of the Petzl RocTrip, more than 1500 people climbed in the wind, dust, heat, and cold, for an unforgettable Patagonian experience! As every year since 2002, the Petzl RocTrip is an opportunity for climbers to come together for a shared passion in a friendly atmosphere. Featuring Sean Villanueva O'Driscoll, Dave Graham, Charlotte Durif, Dani Andrada, Daniel Du Lac, and Nina Caprez.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dlcecxjonOYrnbkYG925tyRwC57.jpg", "actors": ["Dave Graham ()", "Dani Andrada ()", "Sean Villanueva O'Driscoll ()", "Charlotte Durif ()", "Daniel Du lac ()", "Nina Caprez ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
