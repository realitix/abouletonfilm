One night, at a barn dance, he gets a little drunk and rather than going with the hired whores, gives into his desires and sexual relations with an unnamed man. The guilt causes him to run away, hide in the woods and eventually confess everything to Bobbi Lee who doesn't want to believe him only because she was enjoying the forbidden nature of their love. In the end, he cannot accept his sexuality nor can he hide behind Bobbi Lee and that's why he throws himself off the Tallahachee bridge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/96Dg3c79P0Fqgr2OAG9aWe6ceAR.jpg", "actors": ["Robby Benson (Billy Joe McAllister)", "Glynnis O'Connor (Bobbie Lee Hartley)", "Joan Hotchkis (Anna 'Mama' Hartley)", "Terrance Goodman (James Hartley)", "Sandy McPeak (Glenn 'Papa' Hartley)", "James Best (Dewey Barksdale)", "Becky Bowen (Becky Thompson)", "Simpson Hemphill (Brother Taylor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [31944, 34599, 84847, 74899], "youtube_key": "6bKJbaScvbQ"}
