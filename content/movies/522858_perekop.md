A missing plow blade is presented as a symbol of the country's backward peasant economy that needs to be transformed in the course of the industrial construction. In an onslaught of rapidly changing images, Ukrainian village with its peasants suspicious of everything new, dramatically collides with the frenzy of working factories, plants, and mines.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lkDNAzS18ELYk50l9yzrVXojsOK.jpg", "actors": ["Stepan Shagaida (Artem)", "\u0421\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d \u0421\u0432\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e (Kalmyk)", "Ivan Tverdokhleb ()", "Sergei Minin ()", "Oksana Pidlisna ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
