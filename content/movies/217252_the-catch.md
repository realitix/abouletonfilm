They instruct the kids of a village to keep an eye on the prisoner. While the younger kids gradually become friends with the stranger, the older boy called Pang has a different attitude. Since he grew up without parents, he accepted the Khmer rouge as his replacement parents and endears himself to them by betraying villagers. When Pang becomes responsible for watching the prisoner, things become worse for the pilot.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xsVOwFlA8HPGMJoX3pLpt8wprEP.jpg", "actors": ["Cyril Gue\u00ef (Simon Jefferson Lewis)", "Jhem Chuop (Pang)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
