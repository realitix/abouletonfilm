In his mind he\u2019s the next Woodward (but he\u2019s probably more of a Bernstein). A year in, he realizes that maybe the paper business is no longer what he\u2019d seen in the movies. Instead of investigative journalism, he is writing easily consumable Top 10 Lists - Best Hot Dogs in the City! Ten Ways to Tell You Grew Up in the 90s! After the paper is hit with another round of layoffs, Bram stumbles upon a potentially explosive story involving the city\u2019s controversial mayor. But he needs to beat the mayor\u2019s smooth talking aide, Kamal, to the punch. This could be Bram\u2019s big break \u2014 if he had any idea how to be a real journalist.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pAwIhoaWeeejyq582GSETebVbc9.jpg", "actors": ["Nina Dobrev (Ashley)", "Jennifer Ehle ()", "Damian Lewis (Rob Ford)", "Mena Massoud ()", "Scott Speedman ()", "Lauren Collins ()", "Gil Bellows ()", "Rebecca Liddiard (Claire)", "Ben Platt ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
