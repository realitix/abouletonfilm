Actually that\u2019s an odd set of things to be into, hypothetical person reading this, and frankly it\u2019s about time you let us get to the point. Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett riffed this vintage 1962 epic live in Nashville, and now you can enjoy the show in the comfort of your own home, castle, or bottle you share with a leprechaun!  Also! The guys riff the supremely weird short What Is Nothing? (spoiler: we still don\u2019t know what nothing is). Plus two hilarious cartoons from Rich \u201cLowtax\u201d Kyanka of somethingawful.com, a Behind-the-Scenes slideshow, and movie trivia slides done RiffTrax style!  Make sure all these giants didn\u2019t die in vain - join Mike, Kevin, and Bill for a full evening of great live comedy.  Yes! The Special Features are included on both the Download-to-Burn and regular DVD!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aG6tulGJLEy2JGG2rt5GwZoVkH5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
