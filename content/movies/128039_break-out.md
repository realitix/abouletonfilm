A pulsing mix of hard-hitting action, wry social commentary, and black humor, director Jang Hang Joon's Break Out takes a simple premise and spins it into a spiraling film experience. Penniless and slothful Bong Gu (Kim Seung Woo) loses his cheap lighter in the Seoul train station washroom, and it falls into the hands of gangster leader Chul Gon (Cha Seung Won). Bong Gu, determined to retrieve his lighter, follows Chul Gon to Pusan, but the task turns out to be a lot more difficult than he had imagined.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bEWNsvVY8y33s9ZcXq6BnHWTMVh.jpg", "actors": ["Kim Seung-woo (Heo Bok-gu)", "Park Young-gyu (Park Yeong-gab)", "Kang Seong-jin ()", "Lee Mun-sik ()", "Hye-jin Yu ()", "Chae-yeon Kim ()", "Bae Joong-sik ()", "Jae-hyeon Park ()", "Po-Ram Han ()", "Jang Hyun-sung ()", "Kim In-mun ()", "Jae-man Kim ()", "Kim Sun-Kyung ()", "Lee Won-Jong ()", "Sung Ji-ru ()", "Yoo Hae-jin ()", "Lim Hyung-jun ()", "Cha Seung-won (Yang Cheol-gon)", "Lee In ()", "Yun Yeong-keol ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [182307, 224130, 167949, 275913], "youtube_key": "_4EFbeAwDxE"}
