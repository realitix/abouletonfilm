On Arocha: \"I know of no films more uncompromising in grotesquerie of burlesque, in gigantism of overstatement, than the comedies of Arocha. His actors are possessed to frenzy with their roles, filled to bursting with their identities; they hypertrophy into fantastic growths, revealing comic flaws enormous, monstrous enough to swallow whole the old familiar characters of Samson, Traviata, and Dracula, and even to make the best of us laugh.\" -- Ken Kelman.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
