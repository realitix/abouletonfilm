When the home\u2019s owner returns he drags the package inside, then goes about doing a few more activities before deciding to finally open it. Upon removing the paper, he notices it\u2019s a large steel barrel. Using a blowtorch, he gets the lid off and sees it\u2019s full of oily water\u2026 but rising out of the water is a nude, voluptuous, smiling woman, who immediately starts to entice the man by massaging her breasts. Naturally, being in a barrel for who knows how long, she needs to get cleaned off and hops into a bubble bath. While she\u2019s lounging in the tub, the man gets into bed, lights a cigarette and starts to remove him clothes in anticipation. We get to see fantasies from both the man and \u201cthe fairy.\u201d \u2014The Bloody Pit of Horror", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a04WIt56zsuusHRVSSvhSzdm8aH.jpg", "actors": ["To Katinaki ()", "Pierre Lampe ()", "Jean-Pierre Bouyxou ()", "Rapha\u00ebl Marongiu ()", "Marie-Louise Duparc ()", "Jio Berk ()", "Ch\u00e9rie Peace ()", "Spirou Adamopoulos ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [39239, 350062, 350068, 83909], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
