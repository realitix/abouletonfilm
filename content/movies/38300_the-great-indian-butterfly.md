Stressed, frustrated and unable to come to terms with the sacrifice required for success, they go in search of a legendary magical insect - The Great Indian Butterfly. Last seen by the unknown Portuguese explorer Carodiguez, in a remote valley located in erstwhile colonial Goa, the butterfly possesses a magical aura, granting immense happiness to the person who catches it. In the journey that takes the couple from the smog filled, concrete jungle of the Megalopolis of Mumbai through the little discovered coastal landscapes of the western Sahyadris, to the sun soaked land of Goa, the couple lose more than what they want to rediscover. It becomes a passage, which seems to travel with a metaphor of its own and an insect as elusive as a fossil trapped in prehistoric resin.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7DYrFE0y3ABcQ0ZN7BY9BHNmS3e.jpg", "actors": ["Aamir Bashir ()", "Sandhya Mridul ()", "Koel Purie ()", "Barry John ()", "Gourov Dasgupta ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
