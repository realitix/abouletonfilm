They also tell you about their experiences during the protest that took 18 days to remove Mubarak from power, and their views on the world's reaction to their stand off. The voices of the people of Egypt deserve to be heard. In \"Stories From Tahrir\" we reveal the frustrations and aspirations of activists, candidates, and the victims of decades of repression who have never had a chance to share their stories until now.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
