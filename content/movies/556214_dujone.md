But with Meghna's dad being in the fish business as opposed to Dev's industrialist dad, objections are an obvious progression. Things get murkier and gory what with Akash's dad keeping him caged in Siliguri and Meghna's against-romance pishi (Seema) keeping a hawk's eye on her every move. And just when you thought you've seen the best of De's muscle flexing and Srabanti's desperation to meet Akash, in comes a contract killer (Arijit) employed by Akash's dad to finish off Meghna. As all action stories should end, Dujone too reaches a fitting finale with Meghna-Akash's love triumphing over all odds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ijt4uzmIV9toeDGIrA93RnFvnfV.jpg", "actors": ["Dev Adhikari ()", "Srabanti Chatterjee ()", "Seema Biswas ()", "Debesh Roy Chowdhury ()", "Arun Banerjee ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "PCqtzu5eWiM"}
