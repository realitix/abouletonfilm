These may be silly clich\u00e9s, but they are the subject of IL TURCO IN ITALIA and the composer plays with them \u2013 quite deliberately. He knows that he is putting archetypes of Italian comedy on stage with figures such as the exotic lady-killer Selim, the young woman Fiorilla, who is chained to the stove at home, but adventurous, and her husband Geronio, who is ridiculous because he is much too old \u2013 and relishes the ironic exaggeration. Franz Welser-Most conducts the Zurich Opera House Chorus and Orchestra in this performance of Rossini's opera buffa.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aK9kviHjKR43ZgNq9Q3oYTHsBMo.jpg", "actors": ["Ruggero Raimondi (Selim)", "Cecilia Bartoli (Donna Fiorilla)", "Oliver Widmer (Poeta Prosdocimo)", "Paolo Rumetz (Don Geronio)", "Reinaldo Macias (Don Narciso)", "Judith Schmid (Zaida)", "Valery Tsarev (Albazar)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
