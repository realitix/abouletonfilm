He first took photographs there when he was only a student collaborating with his tutor.  Together, they printed the portraits in a newspaper that one could flip through on a bus. This series would help lead Hawkesworth to the first jobs that started his career.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
