It goes back to the German occupation and her hiding of a fellow actor who has supposedly killed a collaborator. He is weak and a bit cowardly, but suffers most from not having any audience for his vanity, ego and supposed bravery. After the war he leaves her but finds out that he has been accused of cowardice. He finally commits suicide and she clears herself of a collaboration charge and eventually becomes a popular actress.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4qRpVMUV7Og5S44Vw0bRaRCYxW0.jpg", "actors": ["Barbara Krafft\u00f3wna (Felicja)", "Zbigniew Cybulski (Wiktor Rawicz)", "Artur M\u0142odnicki (Tomasz)", "Wienczys\u0142aw Gli\u0144ski (Bacteriologist)", "Wies\u0142aw Go\u0142as (German Soldier)", "Kalina J\u0119drusik (Girl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [118566, 199604, 366851, 74903], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
