The Dead Inside is a complex story of a young couple going through seemingly normal problems until the problems become surreal and supernatural . Often the hallmark of a great film is it's ability to blur the lines of classification. The problem is, in this film they aren't very blurry. It is, at times, a musical, at others a horror, sometimes a comedy and a serious drama at others. Where it goes wrong is it seems to delve too far into each area for too long making it confusing as to what the overall feeling the audience is supposed to have. I noticed the director was also the editor and I think that may be what is the biggest problem with this film. It just starts to drag on and on. The musical scenes are pretty good and the dialouge is good too, it's the seemingly endless scenes of people sitting and staring into the mirror or at the computer or at nothing. Good to great music, nice camera work (but has a very video look at times), good script, good lyrics and good acting (though not the best singing voices) just needs some serious editing."}], "recommandations_id": [204456, 37776, 124873, 14472]}
