In so doing, the program cuts through much of the mythos surrounding the conflict itself and enables us to see the war in a fresh new way. It draws on elements including personal correspondence, diaries, archival photographs and much more. Installments include: \"Rally Round the Flag,\" \"Rebels at the Gates,\" \"High Water Mark,\" \"General Grant's War,\" and \"Jubilation.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tI5Bk4ibKOL6JYFN6BZfWjjKQkx.jpg", "actors": ["Allan Brown (Narrator)", "Adam Corey Beatty, Sr. ()", "Don Pay ()", "Sandra Stone Vincey ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
