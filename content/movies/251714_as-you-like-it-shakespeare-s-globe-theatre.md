At its heart, a feisty but feminine Rosalind (Naomi Frederick), in love with the endearingly na\u00efve Orlando (Jack Laskey), uses her disguise as Ganymede to counsel him playfully in the art of wooing. Distraction is provided by Dominic Rowan, a remarkably funny Touchstone, and Tim McMullan, whose sonorous tones are perfectly suited to the lugubrious wit of Jaques. Filmed in High Definition and true surround sound.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rL2IdxUdpYrUMn2NRazK6UD59cE.jpg", "actors": ["Dominic Rowan (Touchstone)", "Gareth Bennett-Ryan (Lord)", "Michael Benz (Silvius)", "Naomi Frederick (Rosalind)", "Sophie Duval (Audrey)", "Brendan Hughes (Duke Frederick)", "Jack Laskey (Orlando de Boys)", "Trevor Martin (Adam)", "Tim McMullan (Jaques)", "Jamie Parker (Oliver de Boys)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
