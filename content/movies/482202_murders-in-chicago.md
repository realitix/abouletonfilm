What follows is a very confusing story in which the police, a police coroner (Jos\u00e9 Campos) and a vagrant (Fernando S\u00e1nchez Polack) who witnessed Fajardo's death embark on separate inquests on what actually happened. Meanwhile, June (Mar\u00eda Luisa Rubio), who works as a secretary for the publishing company, is under pressure by a blackmailer (Antonio Jim\u00e9nez Escribano) who has pictures of her in the sack with the deceased publisher.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vONozUncpQtXKQKUDTB8Ou5jKZl.jpg", "actors": ["Mar\u00eda Luisa Rubio (June)", "Isana Medel (Gladys)", "Eduardo Fajardo (Mr Barlow)", "Jos\u00e9 Campos ()", "Fernando S\u00e1nchez Polack ()", "Antonio Jim\u00e9nez Escribano ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
