This was filmed in 1907 but released in 1908. It was made at the request of Teddy Roosevelt, who saw coyotes being caught in Oklahoma *by hand*, and folks back east didn't believe him. While this movie is called \"The Wolf Hunt\", it was actually coyotes being caught, not wolves.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["John Abernathy ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
