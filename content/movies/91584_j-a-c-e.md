Jace ends up in Athens, Greece, begging at street corners, exploring the secret horrors of brutal institutions for young offenders or, much later, serving obscure patrons, in an underworld where violent loss seems to be his only destiny. The movie follows Jace's inverted Odyssey in a dark universe of abuse, murder and fear, as he desperately (and silently) seeks for a \"family\" of his own or, at least, for a sense of belonging", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7gUuGgLRYNst6f8ab7C4jYrWPv4.jpg", "actors": ["Alban Ukaj (Jace)", "Stefania Goulioti (Maria)", "Argyris Xafis (Angelos Karras)", "Ieronymos Kaletsanos (Antonio)", "Minas Hatzisavvas (Officer Dimitriou)", "Kora Karvouni (Alma)", "Akilas Karazisis (Dr. Markos Kruger)", "Yannis Tsortekis (Thomas Tepelenis)", "Diogo Infante (Nikolas)", "Christos Loulis (Father)", "Franco Trevisi (Andrei)", "Kostas Berikopoulos (Officer Banias)", "Refet Abazi (Mobster)", "Giorgos Mellos (Jace - Teenager)", "Soma Badekas (Jace - Child)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [281577], "youtube_key": "mOqDVLZzanc"}
