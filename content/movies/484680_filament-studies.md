Printed in varying colors and thicknesses ranging from 1 filament layer (.2mm) to 3 filament layers (.6mm), the resulting 1-second strips of film were threaded through a JK optical printer and photographed digitally to produce video output. Still left to do: splice them together and run them through a 16mm projector! And possibly make some attempt at printing animations or patterns into the face of the film, other than the standard MakerBot crosshatch.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
