A family member, friend, or a lover? What is the norm that we are suppose to follow in life? What is perceived as normal on the outside is usually just a daily costume, which we as people like to dance around in to assimilate into society. The question is: Who is Eric Hays? Or more specifically: What is Eric Hays hiding? 306 gives the viewer a chance to see a secret that no one else gets to see.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oa77TMpWZytnj164ltwErUfgASL.jpg", "actors": ["Raquel Houghton (Sam)", "Brian Estel (Eric)", "Scott Lynch-Giddings (Mr. Smith)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
