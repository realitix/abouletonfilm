En route from Shanghai to San Francisco, chief engineer Crusher McKay (Victor McLaglen) and shipboard doctor Tony Craig (Chester Morris) become rivals for the attention of nurse Ann Grayson (Wendy Barrie). A Chinese stowaway, meanwhile, infects the stokehold with cholera and it is left to Crusher to keep the engines at full throttle until reaching harbor. But morale sinks to an all-time low when Crusher himself is stricken and the overworked men threaten with mutiny. Tony attempts to keep the stokers in check but the situation is growing more dangerous by the minute when a heroic Crusher rises from his sickbed. Leaving their previous petty squabbles behind, Tony and Crusher manage to guide the ship safely to harbor, where the doc and Ann rekindle their romance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/geF2Zd3gtHodKwmflUgzEi2E2sq.jpg", "actors": ["Victor McLaglen (Crusher McKay)", "Chester Morris (Doctor Craig)", "Wendy Barrie (Ann Grayson)", "Alan Hale (Gallagher)", "Barry Fitzgerald (Britches)", "Allan Lane (Bilson)", "Halliwell Hobbes (Captain Mathews)", "Cy Kendall (Deadeyes)", "Paul Guilfoyle (Wishart)", "John Wray (Metcalfe)", "Emory Parnell (Olaf)", "Adia Kuznetzoff (Silvio)", "John Bleifer (Kovac)", "Ted Billings (Stoker)", "Eddie Bracken (Junior officer)", "Tyler Brooke (Ship Steward)", "Donald Douglas (Ship's Officer)", "Grace Hayle (Fat Passenger)", "Selmer Jackson (San Francisco Port Doctor)", "Florence Lake (Miss Smith - Dancing with Crusher)", "Arthur Loft (Engineering Officer Dearborn)", "Walter Miller (Ship's Officer)", "Frank Mills (Crew Member)", "Miki Morita (Chinese Stowaway)", "Jack O'Shea (Navigator)", "Douglas Walton (Engineering Officer Bates)", "Anthony Warde (Crew Member)", "Ernest Whitman (Professor - Black Stoker)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [36633, 43449, 98364], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
