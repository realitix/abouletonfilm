Marci and Blair are obsessing over being the perfect parents, Myra and Donald have retired and suddenly feel useless and Elizabeth is bending over backwards to get a promotion at work. Add to that Stephanie's blooming romance with Lawrence - who is torn between being with her and continuing his mission work - and Christmas seems to be taking a back seat. That is, until a group of kids at an orphanage helps the family to realize that there's more to Christmas than wrapping gifts and baking cookies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3DuZsAk3lVztHNC6SwReW7QBupG.jpg", "actors": ["Victoria Rowell ()", "Malinda Williams ()", "Clifton Powell ()", "Gregory Alan Williams ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
