Mingus said of himself \"I am half black man, half yellow man, but I claim to be a Negro. I am Charles Mingus, the famed jazz musician--but not famed enough to make a living in America.\" His statement summed up the conflict that plagued this musical genius his entire life: volatility, pain, prescience, and raw rage roiled inside a complex man, composer, bass player, and trombonist who transcended labels and refused to be pigeonholed into a single musical style--and who did not achieve real fame until late in his career.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sAufV05zSaSwLS39vIj5p9BRPUY.jpg", "actors": ["Charles Mingus (Himself (archive footage))", "Gunther Schuller (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
