His work in the Almagro neighborhood of Buenos Aires in the early 1900s led to the founding of San Lorenzo de Almagro, one of the best soccer clubs in Argentina. (Pope Francis, who grew up in this neighborhood in the 1940s, is a fan). Father Massa (\u00c1ngel Maga\u00f1a), an athletic young priest, is sent to serve a working class community, where he initially faces indifference and hostility. Following the conventions of the Hollywood biopic, the film describes the characters and their plights with affection, and a dash of drama, as they are changed by the example of the priest.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5WqJJn46G84EBuyvHhd1RRqDIbf.jpg", "actors": ["\u00c1ngel Maga\u00f1a (Lorenzo)", "Tito Alonso ()", "Arturo Arcari ()", "Nelly Meden ()", "Roberto Dur\u00e1n ()", "Ricardo Greco ()", "Panchito Lombard ()", "Lalo Malcolm ()", "Domingo Mania ()", "Esperanza Palomero ()", "Bernardo Perrone ()", "\u00d3scar Rovito ()", "Eloy \u00c1lvarez ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
