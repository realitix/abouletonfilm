That said, I didn't really like the first much so that doesn't necessarily mean that it's good.\r\n\r\nKamron (the white kid Jamal) was a good addition, he was a rapper in a little known group called YOUNG BLACK TEENAGERS. A group in which all members were actually NOT black, but believed that they were black on the inside. Very much like the character he plays in the film.\r\n\r\nQueen Latifah is another good addition but her character stops making sense when the Pajama party comes into the mix, she spends the first half talking about empowering black women just to in the end of it thinking that undressing black women for a party for the enjoyment of the males sounding like a good idea. And the whole aspect of the pajama party felt a bit forced, like they threw that in at last moment when they realised they needed a party in the film to sell it as a sequel to House Party.\r\n\r\nMartin Lawrence is one of my favorite comedians but I don't know what it is I don't find him funny at all in these movies, maybe cause his character in these is too much of a douche."}], "recommandations_id": [16097, 16094, 30963, 113211]}
