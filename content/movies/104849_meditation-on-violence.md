Theoretically, the film describes in a single continuous movement three degrees of traditional Chinese boxing, Wu-tang, Shao-lin, and Shao-lin with a sword. A long sequence of the ballet-like, sinuous Wu-tang becomes the more erratic Shao-lin; in the middle, there is an abrupt change to leaping sword movements, in the center of which, at the apogee of the leap, there is a long held freeze-frame.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vbBYXiVrQi85rdBfM5Ks614HsZR.jpg", "actors": ["Chao Li Chi (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [47425, 105577, 105711, 44445], "youtube_key": "H9O9PrvRnjg"}
