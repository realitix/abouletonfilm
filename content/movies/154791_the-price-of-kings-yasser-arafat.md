Yasser Arafat was an incredibly controversial figure- labeled by some as a corrupt terrorist whilst idolized by others as a revolutionary hero. Regardless of people's own opinions, his importance as an international leader cannot be disputed. The film is built around revealing interviews with the people who knew Arafat best; his comrades, confidants, and even his adversaries. The filmmakers also gained exclusive access to Yasser Arafat's widow, Suha, who provides a frank and highly emotional insight into the life that Arafat lived and the sacrifices he made for the Palestinian cause.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/musFpNTn4IwyPXdjjCsLzt9HUHd.jpg", "actors": ["Helena Bonham Carter (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
