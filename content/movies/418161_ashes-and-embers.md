As if every film belonged to a lonely species, Ashes and Embers shows a unique arrogance as it trembles, somewhat defenseless, with no certainty that the folds of fiction constitute any kind of survival guarantee for such strange objects. Memory and ghosts are two words that are easily said, but in this singular and very refined film they seem destined to become the ultimate goal of cinema, and its most endurable desire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Abu2Oyi0gYeS1gvV5eHAewHNx7O.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "121881404"}
