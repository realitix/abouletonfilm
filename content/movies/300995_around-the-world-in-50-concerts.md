The tour develops not just into a journey across the globe but also as a trip to the core of classical music, a quest for the palette of emotions which only classical music can arouse. In 2013 the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra tours the whole world to celebrate its 125th anniversary: 50 concerts spread over 6 continents. Unbounded passion and love for music brings musicians and concert goers together. Documentary maker Heddy Honigmann lands with the orchestra in Buenos Aires, Soweto and St Petersburg and shows how the ensemble succeeds in gaining the hearts of people with a different cultural background. A journey to the kernel and the power of music which knows how to touch unexpected emotions and which helps to overcome the pain of living.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tjd7z5zSVIDiBCwkpsmy73f56UA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "HAlwkw5BxLQ"}
