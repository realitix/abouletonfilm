Even before reaches class he bumps into cocky, athletic rascal Oliver. It seems like Oliver's best friend Silke (a girl) taking to Martin will aggravate their tension, but she actually gets them to spend time together and grow closer. Martin even takes the blame, which neither parent understands, for Oliver smoking in class, a third strike meaning expulsion. Oliver's knavish mischief actually stems from his dad's drinking problem and its root, his ma's infidelity. When he runs away, Martin takes him in.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iAew7mHjCAuZbj5P50L2muouEFd.jpg", "actors": ["Johann Hillmann (Martin)", "Konrad Baumann (Oliver Huber)", "Lea Eisleb (Silke)", "Inka Friedrich (Martins Mutter)", "Stephan Kampwirth (Martins Vater)", "Claudia Geisler (Olivers Mutter)", "Andreas Hoppe (Olivers Vater)", "Inga Busch (Silkes Mutter)", "Butz Ulrich Buse (Altmann)", "Jan Messutat (Armin Adler)", "Monica Meier-Ivancan (Sonnen\u00f6lfrau)", "Miriam Schweiger (Rieke)", "Anna Holter (Tanzlehrerin)", "Sonja Deutsch (Frau Mayland)", "Hans Klima (Herr Mayland)", "Matthias Grundig (Herr K\u00f6rner)", "Karl Korte (Zwinkerer)", "Gabriele Domschke (Kinokassiererin)", "Julia Koschitz (Corinna)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
