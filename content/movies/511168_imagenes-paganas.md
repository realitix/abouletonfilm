The audacity of Federico Moura at the head of the La Plata's band exceeded the limits of rock and is still a source of art-pop knowledge. Im\u00e1genes Paganas explores that tension and rejection in times of dictatorship, a scourge that the Moura family paid with the disappearance of Federico's older brother. The documentary by Costantino inaugurates a time of historical reparation with Federico Moura as a warrior of modernity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wNgRY67A7fIcDvfjUmUqqmNumPV.jpg", "actors": ["Federico Moura (Himself  (archive footage))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
