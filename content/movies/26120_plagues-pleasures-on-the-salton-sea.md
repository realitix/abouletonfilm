This award-winning film from directors Chris Metzler and Jeff Springer details the rise and fall of the Salton Sea, from its heyday as the \"California Riviera\" where boaters and Beach Boys mingled in paradise to its present state of decaying, forgotten ecological disaster. From wonderland to wasteland, PLAGUES &amp; PLEASURES ON THE SALTON SEA captures a place far more interesting than the shopping malls and parking lots of suburban America, a wacky world where a beer-swilling Hungarian Revolutionary, a geriatric nudist, and a religious zealot building a monument to God all find solace and community.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3He7DJKvwj9xSgt4qaOzwtLFOvQ.jpg", "actors": ["John Waters (Narrator)", "Sonny Bono (Himself)", "Norm Niver (Himself)", "Petre Melvin (Himself)", "Leonard Knight (Himself)", "Bobbie Todhunter (Herself)", "Steve Horvitz (Himself)", "Lechon Rainey (Herself)", "Paul Clement (Himself)", "Manny Diaz (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [63088], "youtube_key": "3oTZkDjAH3M"}
