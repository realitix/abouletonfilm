The greatest legends of jazz, from Louis Armstrong to the cool Miles Davis, are caught in some of their most passionate or private moments. Epitomizing the spirit of 1960\u2019s counter-culture, a hippie plays a flute as he walks along, all his earthly belongings in a back-pack. Lost in her own thoughts for a moment, Audrey Hepburn sits pensive between takes.  Images capture the subdued beauty of a Provence winter. Like an abstract painting, the sun appears as a point of light behind a window coated thickly with frost. Modern architecture captured as an almost sci-fi fantasy - an environment so artificial that it is sublimely beautiful. All of these images came from the eye, mind and camera of Dennis Stock (1928-2010), one of the most influential chroniclers of the late 20th century.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cLOmqZCCDDmphHVLQMplB4Va8Vi.jpg", "actors": ["Dennis Stock (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
