It is two different kinds of sale jobs working at cross-purposes. Oppenheimer takes the luster off the idealistic advertising images through video distortion and electronic interference and cuts-up both the video and audio tracks until the weird poetry of the chain gang prisoner's lessons in life and death gives the commercial presentation a creepy disconnection from any kind of living ideal. It follows A BRIEF HISTORY OF PARADISE AS TOLD BY THE COCKROACHES and MARKET UPDATE as another sharp jab at consumerism as an illusory promise.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2KEjvfRyw4iIuuNmLrdB6hX1Tv6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
