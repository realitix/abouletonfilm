And I guess if a horror movie should get any character right, it's that one.\r\n\r\nThe Harley and Joker clone aspect is a little bit of a weird direction to go in, but I guess it's acceptable.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}], "recommandations_id": [531398, 531208, 366824, 365651]}
