While the small-town cops scramble to protect the townsfolk, the killings seem to center around one young woman who may be the final victim on Santa's list. As the slaughter continues and the bodies pile up, it seems that nothing and no one may be able to stop the murderers before they complete their own deadly take on the twelve days of Christmas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xoTbJcyGyBrAtlwoCEFtgo2MnEk.jpg", "actors": ["Simon Phillips (Santa Claus)", "Sayla de Goede (Mrs. Claus)", "Laurel Brady (Jennifer)", "Jeff Ellenberger (Sam Fullard)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "Gimly", "content": "Every actor in this is **horrendous** with the one exception of the primary antagonist. And I guess if a horror movie should get any character right, it's that one.\r\n\r\nThe Harley and Joker clone aspect is a little bit of a weird direction to go in, but I guess it's acceptable.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}], "recommandations_id": [365651, 531398, 531208, 424284], "youtube_key": "wymMmIQiRr8"}
