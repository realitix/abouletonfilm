The central character, played by Mona Hofland, is a nastily manipulative woman who enjoys playing one lover against the other. Her diabolical antics are fascinating to watch; less fascinating is the story, a romantic-triangle intrigue that the European cinema had presumably outgrown years earlier. Still, the film was based on a popular novel (by Siguard Hohl), so it had a built-in audience, good or bad. Stevenmoete met Giemto Ar was Norway's 1957 contribution to the Berlin Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ayQ6Unan7irLiCG31NmagmG20L2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
