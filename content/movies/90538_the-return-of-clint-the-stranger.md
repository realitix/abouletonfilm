George Martin returns as Clint (renamed Trinity in some countries), an ex-gunslinger desperately wanting to be forgiven and accepted by his family that he abandoned years earlier. One major differences in the plot when compared to the first film is the addition of Klaus Kinski as a ruthless bounty hunter. The bounty hunter tracks Clint down and forces him to return to his violent ways to protect himself and his family.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/366tb8nkNdk5n1igk8sKYTTYmw0.jpg", "actors": ["George Martin (Clint Harrison)", "Marina Malfatti (Norma Harrison)", "Klaus Kinski (Scott)", "Daniel Mart\u00edn (Slim)", "Augusto Pescarini (Jimmy Harrison (as Augusto Pesarini))", "Francisco Jos\u00e9 Huetos (Mr Scranton (as Francisco Jose Huetos))", "Susanna Atkinson (Betty Harrison (as Billy))", "Willi Colombini ()", "Luis Ponciado (Brandell)", "Gaspar 'Indio' Gonz\u00e1lez (Sheriff Culver (as Indio Gonzales))", "Manuel Mu\u00f1iz (Telegrapher (as Pajarito))", "Manuel Sas (Bill McKinley)", "Ricardo Moy\u00e1n ((as Ricardo Moyan))", "Manuel Bronchud (Ross)", "Gustavo Re (Blinky - bartender)", "Adolfo Alises (Mr Thompson)", "Miguel Muniesa (Ben)", "Vittorio Fanfoni (Murdoch brother)", "Luigi Antonio Guerra (Murdoch brother)", "Luis Induni (Arnold McKinley (uncredited))", "Mara Krupp (Brothel Mother (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
