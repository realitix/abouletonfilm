The human aspect of the story centers on a rodeo rider whose late father bequeathed him a ranch in Calgary, Canada. The rider really tries to settle down to ranching, but finds himself pining for the rodeo. His forewoman, also a former rodeo performer, thinks her employer is shirking his duties and needs to forget about broncos, and bull-riding and settle down. Meanwhile, the fellow also longs to catch the white stallion running wild. The dog helps out.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aAdXRV9EaevaGgICioHRB8dRCv2.jpg", "actors": ["Joan Leslie (Chris Johnson)", "James Craig (Dan Bennett)", "Jack Oakie (Mike Kirby)", "Chill Wills (Mileaway)", "Victor Kilian (Mel Saunders)", "Stanley Andrews (Bowles)", "Ray Bennett (Barkis)", "Lane Chandler (Scrivner)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
