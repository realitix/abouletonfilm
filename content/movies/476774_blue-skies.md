The audience was expected to believe that the twentysomething Twelvetrees and Frank Albertson are teenagers living together platonically in an orphan asylum. A wealthy old man comes calling to adopt Albertson -- who, feeling sorry for Twelvetrees, trades places with the girl. Thus it is that the heroine is carted off to a luxurious mansion, while Albertson remains behind. One year later, the old man discovers Albertson's deception, whereupon he invites the boy to live with him as well. By this time, Twelvetrees and Albertson are of marriageable age, thus the film ends with a wedding in the offing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9dfQvD90PMfuKr3rfP6H5nOFFqg.jpg", "actors": ["Carmencita Johnson (Dorothy May (age 6) (episode 1))", "Freddie Burke Frederick (Richard Lewis (age 8))", "Ethel Wales (Matron (episode 1))", "Helen Twelvetrees (Dorothy May (episode 2))", "Frank Albertson (Richard Lewis (episode 2))", "Rosa Gore (Nellie Crouch (episode 2))", "William Orlamond (Janitor)", "E.H.
