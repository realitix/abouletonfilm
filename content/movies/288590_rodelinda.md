Rodelinda is faced with an impossible dilemma: With her husband Bertarido believed dead, she either has to marry the despised Grimoaldo (the elegant Joseph Kaiser), who has usurped her husband\u2019s throne, or see him murder her son. But Bertarido (leading countertenor Andreas Scholl) is alive and eventually reclaims both throne and wife\u2014and makes peace with his enemies. Stephanie Blythe is marvelous as Eduige, Bertarido\u2019s sister, who is betrothed to Grimoaldo but turns against him.
