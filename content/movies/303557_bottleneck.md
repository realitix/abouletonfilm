Using a jar of sprouting Mung beans as a metaphor it takes into consideration contemporary manifestations of national borders as they relate to regional and international growth and movement. This video emerges from questions such as: Who gains access? How does water transform a space and its borders? Who can move freely and access resources? What moves in and out of a given space and the boundaries that attempt to demarcate and contain it?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/swXThqg62frXROsazH7cxRv6Uxo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
