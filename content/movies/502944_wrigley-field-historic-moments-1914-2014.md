Limited Edition. Wrigley Field, Chicagos field of dreams\u2026 Built in 1914, Wrigley Field is the last of the jewel box designed ballparks that were popular in the early part of the 20th century. It is now the only professional ballpark with an ivy-covered wall. Although Wrigley Field has been home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series. The last World Series won by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home. The Chicago Bears of the National Football League played at Wrigley Field from 1921 to 1970 before relocating to Soldier Field. This marvelous DVD captures moments from the past 100 years that will be cherished by all Cub fans! Unforgettable Moments Include: Hand-turned Scoreboard; Winds of Wrigley Field; Walls of Vines; Roof-top Fans; Bleacher Bums; Take Me Out to the Ballgame; Billy Goats Curse; Black Cat of 1969; Babe Ruth's 1932 Home Run; Opening Night - Light Comes to Wrigley Field.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mizrLtv0KmnQtvxPqKcJNQ0SB1J.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
