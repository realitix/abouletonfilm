From 1980 to 1990 they were billed as Exude.  They had a college playlist hit with \"Boys Just Want to Have Sex\" and got two videos on MTV. In 1990 they changed their name to NC-17 and revamped their style into a grungier more Floyd-influenced sound.  Filmmaker Dov Kelemer made a documentary of their career struggles. Once the movie was completed--it played on cable, at film festivals, and a few theaters.  It's available from the www.anybodylisten.com site.  NC-17 has since become inactive, as the members have scattered over several different states. Lead vocalist Frank Rogala remains active on the OC music scene.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zegJt5EF98kx3KfQgP6Jyafjptc.jpg", "actors": ["Frank Rogala (himself)", "Vince Rogala (himself)", "Robin Canada (himself)", "Nancy Rogala (herself)", "Katherine Turman (herself)", "Jim Washburn (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
