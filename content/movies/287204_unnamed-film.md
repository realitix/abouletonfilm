In \"Unnamed Film\", she shoots the old bubushka ladies as they expertly prepare pickles, pick vegetables, and sing odes to vodka. Shot on 16mm with non-sync sound, it has an intimate, handmade quality, only heightened by the use of explanatory inter-titles in place of subtitles. Uman\u2019s Ukrainain was weak, so she wanted the viewer to have the same experience as she did, just getting the gist of things. As with Uruphong\u2019s work, there is a nostalgia for the old ways, which were self-sufficient but took an incredible toll on the body. The bubushkas complain about their aching backs and the never-ending poverty, spiking any drift towards romanticization.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qVzxTtFWue19f9gm2oqvzNGnMd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
