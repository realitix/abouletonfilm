Looking to fulfill a life-long dream of having a place in the country, he went out on a limb and purchased the enchanting but dilapidated structure. Adrien took charge of an elaborate restoration of the property spanning seven years, transforming it into a magical place to share with family and friends. Teaming up with filmmaker Kevin Ford, Adrien created a personal cinematic record of the journey. Stone Barn Castle is a portrayal of the pursuit of dreams and the distance one must travel to achieve them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kB5Rwaqp37uYtTEZunjSmMJ7YY2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
