He was the one who would unite Heavens and Earth. A natural philosopher, mathematician, theologian and alchemist, with inexhaustible patience and persistence, Newton was seeking throughout his entire life how God's Design was imprinted in nature. Forged in a hard childhood, defiant and unbowed, confrontational and loner, an endless source of inspiration and creativity, Newton sealed with his work the entire 18th century. The political and social conflicts of the time, Royal Society's establishment, constant changes in political power and the complexities of Newton's personality offer a complete picture of the conditions that led to the emersion of his work.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zuo3xzIBM4dLjFfM5i6xTlkKTv0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "9t_RkLhLcOo"}
