After being rejected by the first local girl he speaks to, Frank feels down on his luck, and to console him, the bartender offers him a drink called Absinthe in a bright green glowing bottle. To help console his friend, Hiro drinks the bottle with Frank, and the two of them promptly pass out. Together they wake up in Edo-era Japan, and are taken through a comedic time slip action frenzy where they have to work together to battle both samurai and ninja to find their way back home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ifsuXgzXcP5xMuzIFmFD5fsFKI4.jpg", "actors": ["Chuck Johnson (Frank)", "Tomoko Hayakawa ()", "Masahito Kawahata (Hiro)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
