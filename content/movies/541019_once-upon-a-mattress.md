This production, videotaped in color, included original Broadway cast members Burnett, Gilford and White, and also featured Bernadette Peters as Lady Larken, Ken Berry as Prince Dauntless, Ron Husmann as Harry, and Wally Cox as The Jester. It was directed by Ron Field and Dave Powers.[9] Again, several songs were eliminated and characters were combined or altered. Since the parts of the Minstrel and the Wizard were cut from this adaptation, a new prologue was written with Burnett singing \"Many Moons Ago\" as a bedtime story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9863ee8xJNJYFJyCGi4t8dYF5DW.jpg", "actors": ["Carol Burnett (Princess Winifred the Woebegone)", "Ken Berry (Prince Dauntless)", "Jane White (Queen Aggravain)", "Bernadette Peters (Lady Larkin)", "Jack Gilford (King Sextimus)", "Wally Cox (The Jester)", "Ron Husmann (Sir Harry)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
