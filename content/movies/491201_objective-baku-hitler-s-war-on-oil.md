Hitler is well aware of Germany\u2019s weakness in this area: he does not possess the necessary oil resource. To win the war, he needs to find oil quickly and focuses his attention on the Soviet Socialist Republic of Azerbaijan, part of the Soviet Union.  Its capital city, Baku, is the world\u2019s No. 1 oil producer and becomes a prey that Hitler needs to capture as quickly as possible, in order to establish his Reich. But the Soviets and the Allies are dead set on stopping him, even if this means wiping the city off the map. It is clear that whoever controls its production will be in pole position to win the war.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/38eqmLsOU4UqBat5mWnTrJb2YBB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
