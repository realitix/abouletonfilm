Edgar has become a mail-order Private Detective and a client soon knocks on his door with a job for Edgar. He is to go to a house and get the treasure hidden in a wall. But the residents, Vi and Danny, two crooks in hiding, won't let him in the house. Vi refuses to cook and Danny agrees to let her hire a cook, and makes it clear that all of Vi's other attributes (of which it is implied, with a heavy-handed smirk, there are many) more than offset her lack of culinary skills. Edgar encounters Beulah Jackson, an applicant for the job, outside the house and scares her away and she leaves her agency papers in her wake. Edgar then puts on black makeup, dons a dress, knocks on the door and is hired.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Edgar Kennedy (Edgar, the Private Detective)", "Sally Payne (Sally Kennedy, Edgar's Wife)", "Dot Farley (Sally's Mother)", "Jack Rice (Sally's Brother)", "Lillian Randolph (Beulah Jackson, fast-exiting job applicant)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
