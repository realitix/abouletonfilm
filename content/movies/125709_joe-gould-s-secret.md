Mitchell is fascinated with this Harvard grad and writes a 1942 piece about him, \"Professor Seagull,\" bringing Gould some celebrity and an invitation to join the Greenwich Village Ravens, a poetry club he's often crashed. Gould's touchy, querulous personality and his frequent dropping in on Mitchell for hours of chat lead to a breakup, but the two Joes stay in touch until Gould's death and Mitchell's unveiling of the secret.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n7X4jmmRIRtqNQWXJt8LxZcS1Ja.jpg", "actors": ["Ian Holm (Joe Gould)", "Stanley Tucci (Joe Mitchell)", "Hope Davis (Therese Mitchell)", "Sarah Hyland (Elizabeth Mitchell)", "Hallee Hirsh (Nora Mitchell)", "Celia Weston (Sarah)", "Susan Sarandon (Alice Neel)", "Patricia Clarkson (Vivian Marquie)", "Alice Drummond (Helen)", "Steve Martin (Charlie Duell)", "Lauren Ward (Anne)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [100196], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
