Becoming Human explores the origins of us -where modern humans and our capacities for art, invention, and survival came from, and how our social history led to 3-5% of our genetic heritage being Neanderthal.  Featuring interviews with world-renowned scientists, footage shot in the trenches as fossils were unearthed, and stunning computer-generated animation, Becoming Human brings early hominids to life, examining how they lived and how we became the creative and adaptable modern humans of today.\r In gripping forensic detail, we meet: Selam, the amazingly complete remains of a 3 million year-old child, packed with clues to why we split from the apes, came down from the trees, and started walking upright; Turkana Boy -a tantalizing fossil of Homo erectus, the first ancestor to leave Africa and colonize the globe. What led to this first great African exodus?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ksTkffs80QJF0GAgVIhBQ2g3HX9.jpg", "actors": ["Juan Luis Arsuaga (Himself)", "Dominique Bonjean (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
