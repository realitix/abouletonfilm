This time the two friends are off to San Francisco's Chinatown in search of a millionaire's missing daughter (Sylvia Chang, who also appears in Slaughter in San Francisco), who has vanished under shady circumstances. Typical Backalley Princess shtick ensues, including the duo's disastrous stint waiting tables in a Chinese restaurant and run-ins with the local street gangs. But just when things are looking hopeless, Sam and Polly find the lead they need, and the chase is on!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kDU6ITLFpDdRIDRAAy7PQPuTjSA.jpg", "actors": ["Polly Shang-Kuan Ling-Feng (Hot Pepper Kid)", "Samuel Hui (Embroidered Pillow)", "Sylvia Chang (Syvlia Lin Hsiu Yin)", "Don Wong Tao (Yellow Faced Tiger)", "Pamela Pak (Master Chang's sister)", "Idemura Fumio (Master Chang Te Biao)", "Roger (Rodger)", "Melvin Wong (Gang Leader)", "Wong Sam (Uncle Wang)", "Chin Yuet-Sang (Gangster)", "Lam Ching-Ying (Gangster)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
