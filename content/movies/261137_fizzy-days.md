The fastest and most nimble of these was the Fizzy. It was the passport to a young boys dream---Girls. 'Get the bike, get the girl'. It never worked of course, but on occasion it came close! Eddy and Tommo are two likely teenagers about to finish school. They need transport if they are to win the affection of Debs and Ange, two local girls itching too, for the freedom a moped might bring. The two lads set off on a quest to secure funds by any means, to purchase two hot chick magnets--- a couple of Fizzies! Fizzy Days is an affectionate look at a time before video games and I-pods. When all you really needed to get to the front of the line was a Fizzy.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
