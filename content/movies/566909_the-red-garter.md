It's a place where guys go to dream away the cares of the day, and where the strippers actually enjoy their time in the spotlight. But now Hyapatia's lesbian gal pal Colleen Brennan wants her to sell the club and come live in luxury with her. She doesn't want to sell, and instead spends her time dreaming of erotic encounters with her well-built lawyer Richard Pacheco. The action is filled with luscious natural beauties and plenty of strip club bump-and-grind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4NFe5yUbNBGIif9aa3Y3sQNLwL2.jpg", "actors": ["Hyapatia Lee ()", "Tish Ambrose ()", "Bonnie Belle ()", "Colleen Brennan ()", "Mauvais De Noir ()", "Kari Foxx ()", "Alexis Greco ()", "Nina Hartley ()", "Misty Regan ()", "Bud Lee ()", "Richard Pacheco ()", "Herschel Savage ()", "Anthony Spinelli ()", "Ray Wells ()", "Randy West ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
