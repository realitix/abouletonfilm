Five people were killed, many more infected and the nation was terrorized. Seven years later, after mistakenly pursuing one suspect, the most expensive and complex investigation ever undertaken by the FBI ended when they identified Army scientist Dr. Bruce Ivins as the sole perpetrator of the attacks \u2014 after Ivins had taken his own life. Now, new questions are being raised about the FBI\u2019s investigative methods and whether Ivins really did it. FRONTLINE, in a co-production with ProPublica, and McClatchy Newspapers, takes a hard look at the FBI\u2019s investigation of the country\u2019s most notorious act of bioterrorism.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
