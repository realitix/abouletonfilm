The play was written by Ian Curteis, an experienced writer who had started his television career in drama, but had increasingly come to specialise in dramatic reconstructions of history. It was originally commissioned by the BBC in 1983, for production and broadcast in 1986, but was subsequently shelved by Controller of BBC One Michael Grade due to its alleged pro-Margaret Thatcher stance and jingoistic tone. This prompted a press furore over media bias and censorship.The play was not staged until 2002, when it was broadcast in separate adaptations on BBC Television and Radio.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xQ4e3MxeYZtjeRK4VwiL2A2n3bc.jpg", "actors": ["Patricia Hodge (Rt.
