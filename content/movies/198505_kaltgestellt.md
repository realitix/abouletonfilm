A polarized society is, at one end, terrified after a public official (Hanns Martin Schleyer) is kidnapped and at the other end, enraged by the mysterious, sudden deaths of members of the Baader-Meinhof leftist guerrillas in prison. Brasch sympathizes with the liberal causes, and after he implicates Koerner and the NSB in some dirty dealings that resulted in the suicide of a young teen, the schoolteacher is fired -- and so is Koerner for being caught out. Both men react combatively to their dismissals and the drama escalates.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sCGI8TOxTxpTuoPFJv62fDkPh3p.jpg", "actors": ["Helmut Griem (Brasch)", "Martin Benrath (K\u00f6rner)", "\u00c1ngela Molina (Francoise)", "Meret Becker (Anna)", "Friedhelm Ptok (Sokolowski)", "Hans-G\u00fcnter Martens (Schr\u00f6der)", "Frank Schendler (Kapuste)", "Thomas Kufahl (Schindler)", "Peter Lustig ()", "Monika Hansen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
