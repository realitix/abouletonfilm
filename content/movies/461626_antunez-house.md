The city of Talca was near its epicentre, leaving many historic neighbourhoods in ruins. CASA ANT\u00daNEZ is an intimate portrait of one beloved home in Talca, and how its destruction reveals a divided family. When the mother sells the adobe ruins to her architect son Jos\u00e9 Luis, his brothers and cousins are sceptical about his intentions. Over three years, we witness their psychological process of losing a childhood home as they confront the future of its land. CASA ANT\u00daNEZ is a poetic homage to the very notion of \u2018home\u2019 after a disaster.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eHHkbLKz4Jtt75Bg63e95U8PffB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
