What is it like to live in mega cities such as S\u00e3o Paulo, Mexico City and Tiflis? Filmmaker Thomas Haemmerli broaches the topics of city development, architecture, density, housing market, xenophobia and gentrification from an autobiographical perspective. The path of his life has led him from a childhood in the villa district of Z\u00fcrichberg, through his teenage years as squatter to flat shares, yuppie apartments and finally second homes in various cities. Only recently having become a dad, he plans to further enhance Zurich\u2019s price appreciation by purchasing a huge, extended city apartment\u2026  This multifaceted essay not only humorously questions the filmmaker\u2019s decisions, but also those of the right-wing conservatives, who are afraid of losing their space to immigrants, and the political left, who fail to embrace modern-age architecture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iST63lJLAhNtyq7wFgrS9KS1Rjq.jpg", "actors": ["Thomas Haemmerli (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
