In this in-depth look at the top level of CrossFit competition, we catch up with 2014\u2019s top-seeded competitors Camille Leblanc-Bazinet, Rich Froning, Jason Khalipa, Josh Bridges, Sam Briggs, Lindsey Valenzuela and more.  Watch as we get inside the minds of the athletes who achieve their dreams of making it to the Games and find out what makes them tick. What are they thinking before 3-2-1 \u2026 go? Who are they watching? What are their expectations?  At the end of the weekend, three women and three men occupy the coveted Games podium and while some are already thinking about 2015, others are taking in every second of what may be their last time on the floor of the CrossFit Games.
