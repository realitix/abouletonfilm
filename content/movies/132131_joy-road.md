He's forced to put his plans on hold when his sister Nia asks him to defend her fiance', a gang kingpin who is under arrest for a triple murder that he says he didn't commit. Tony feels the pressure of the case when the feds and a shadowy corporation get involved, along with a private investigator who seems to be working all sides. When Nia starts an investigation of her own into the murder, it not only brings her closer to the truth - it puts both herself and Tony in harm's way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r6tdrRwGnw8OceB31DkNH9h62Cd.jpg", "actors": ["Roger Guenveur Smith (Charles Blocker)", "N'Bushe Wright (Nia)", "Obba Babatund\u00e9 (Dr. Howard Perkins)", "Melle Powers (Kim Smalls)", "Christian Mathis (Big Boy)", "Benjamin B.
