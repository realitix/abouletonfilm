It was the sixth event under the No Mercy chronology and starred wrestlers from the SmackDown! brand.  The main event saw WWE Champion Brock Lesnar defend his title against The Undertaker in a match where a chain was hung from a pole and the first man to reach it could use it as a legal weapon in what was called a Biker Chain match. Two featured bouts were scheduled on the undercard. In a singles match for the WWE United States Championship, the Big Show challenged Eddie Guerrero for the title. The other was also a singlesmatch, in which Kurt Angle fought John Cena.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oLB9lnKYybpYDlKGLNaiJYwW6QR.jpg", "actors": ["Mark William Calaway (The Undertaker)", "Brock Lesnar (Himself)", "Paul Wight (Big Show)", "Eddie Guerrero (Himself)", "John Cena (Himself)", "Kurt Angle (Himself)", "Vince McMahon (Himself)", "Stephanie McMahon (Herself)", "Rena Marlette Lesnar (Sable)", "Matt Hardy (Himself)", "Ron Simmons (Faarooq)", "John Charles Layfield (Bradshaw)", "Chris Benoit (Himself)", "Matt Bloom (A-Train)", "Yoshihiro Tajiri (Tajiri)", "Oscar Gutierrez Rubio (Rey Mysterio)", "Zachary Gowen (Himself)", "Doug Basham (Himself)", "Daniel Hollie (Danny Basham)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "TvmH90BMbnY"}
