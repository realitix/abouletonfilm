Her friendship with Abella Danger is strong. They've been buds since forever, and now, at the point when they are expected to conform and wait for the masses of boys in their high school to hoard to their doors. However, Abella sees that waiting at that door isn't worth it. She knows that Kenna will feel the same and with a gentle push, she's able to seduce her \"more than a friend\" into luscious lesbian love. But with the question of her sexuality raised, Kenna can't help but wonder where she will fit. She tries the infamous lesbianover to great success, but will it be babysitting her beautiful step-sister that truly turns her lesbian sprockets?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m2lB4HjM5j4JLMvc79LJHgruQHa.jpg", "actors": ["Abella Danger ()", "Alison Rey ()", "Hollie Mack ()", "Kenna James ()", "Piper Perri ()", "Xandra Sixx ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
