She is taken in by friendly Indians and stays at their camp. Later, Akkomi (Edler), chief of the tribe, asks his friend Dan Overton to take the girl as it is not good for her to remain in the camp. Dan provides for \"Tana\" and falls in love with her but, because of her past, she keeps him at a distance. Jim Harris comes by and recognizes Tana as the boy robber, but when he attempts to blacken her past, Dan gives him a beating which paralyzes him. Jim then stays on with Dan, who regrets his hastiness. Eventually Tana's father appears and demands that Tana go away with him. She refuses but also does not tell Dan of this trouble.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/13E7sooy8A5w3i9HLxQQLVE2kHP.jpg", "actors": ["Blanche Sweet (Montana Rivers)", "Mahlon Hamilton (Dan Overton)", "Frank Lanning (Jim Harris)", "Edward Peil Sr. (Lee Holly)", "Charles Edler (Akkomi)", "Claire Du Brey (Lottie)", "Kate Price (Mrs. Huzzard)", "Jack Roseleigh (Max Lyster)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
