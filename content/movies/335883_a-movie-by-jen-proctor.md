As a remake, the video provides a parallel narrative that explores the changes in historical and visual icons from 1958 to 2010 \u2013 and those images that remain surprisingly, and delightfully, the same. The work also comments on the pervasiveness of footage available for appropriation in an online world, and the way disparate threads in the YouTube and LiveLeak databases can be assembled to create \u201ca movie.\u201d", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
