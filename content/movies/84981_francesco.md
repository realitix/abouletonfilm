He seeks the Pope's blessing, and he endures persecution at the hands of the family of Chiara Offreduccio (1194-1253), who becomes St. Clare. Many join the order he has established and then rebel at his expectations. In near despair - and ill - he writes a Rule to take to the Pope; then, the Lord sends him a message. He dies smiling.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/57DZv5sQRIXRThcZRpAr8VMd73S.jpg", "actors": ["Mickey Rourke (Francesco)", "Helena Bonham Carter (Chiara)", "Andr\u00e9a Ferr\u00e9ol (Francesco's Mother)", "Nikolaus Dutsch (Cardinal Colonna)", "Peter Berling (Bishop Guido)", "Hanns Zischler (Pope Innocent III)", "Mario Adorf (Cardinal Ugolino)", "Paolo Bonacelli (Francesco's Father)", "Fabio Bussotti (Leone)", "Riccardo De Torrebruna (Pietro Cattani)", "Matteo Corsini (Angelo)", "Edward Farrelly (Egidio)", "Paolo Proietti (Pacifico)", "Paco Reconti (Rufino)", "Diego Ribon (Bernardo di Quintavalle)", "Maurizio Schmidt (Masseo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [74649, 163706, 58084, 10626], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
