Through a chance meeting at the studio, she meets the young and grungy Hip Hop music artist Sunen and asks him to help her make a demo tape.  Not only is the ensuing story about differences growing closer and the difficulties that have to be overcome, well told. Also the music is exceptionally well made. It is quite unbelievable that this is the first feature of the director.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/96nGo7zLEuCuakmOqFDheMdbgPT.jpg", "actors": ["Pamela Tola (Nelli)", "Samuel Vauramo (Sune)", "Joonas Sartamo (Kondis)", "Eero Milonoff (Isukki)", "Jussi Nikkil\u00e4 (Mikko)", "Elena Leeve (Mari)", "Mikko Kouki (Anssi)", "Mikko Leppilampi (D.T.)", "Anna-Leena H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen (Hilkka)", "Eero Saarinen (Nelli's dad)", "Lotta Kaihua (Pilvi)", "Laura Malmberg (Isukki's girlfriend)", "David Sandqvist (Sune's younger brother)", "Jaana J\u00e4rvinen (Choirmaster)", "Ari M\u00e4kinen (Mikko's father)", "Marjo Federley (Mikko's mother)", "Timo Mann (Cleaner)", "Rainer Kaunisto (Record company's CEO)", "Kaisa Mattila (Drunken woman)", "Dome Karukoski (Rowdy hip-hopper)", "Minka Kuustonen (Groupie)", "Tarja Saikkonen (Teenager at suburban bar)", "Niklas Mikael Hyv\u00e4rinen (Bouncer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [54764, 38205, 22554, 26147], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
