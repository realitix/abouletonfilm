We follow a group of four aimless, suburban teenagers - they skateboard the park, sleep in the sun, and rummage through the decaying remains completely unaware that this is where a lonesome teen is confronting a horrific past. Day turns to night, people disappear, and the secrets of Sunset Edge are revealed in a paralyzing finale.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iS4qIyNSu43iWHkjrFqSO5sytkb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "qOG2IMLg628"}
