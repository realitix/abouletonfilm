He can't help but crank out the occasional false note, just often enough to enrage his listeners and discourage any donations. He dreams of playing a large pipe organ. The juke box drowns him out at a cocktail bar, a church organ drowns him out on a street, pinball machines drown him out at Luna Park. The city's neon lights and commercial posters overwhelm his small art. At the end of the day, he captures the tear of a calliope horse - his sole earnings for the day - which may prove magical.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zjEfochqCGd8ieyrzOfBS17c7fP.jpg", "actors": ["Werner Edebau (The Voice)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
