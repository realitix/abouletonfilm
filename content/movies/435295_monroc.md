A still image of the picturesque industrial ruin appears repeatedly throughout the half-hour work like a refrain, its stanzas comprising three independent abstract studies. The soundtrack by Martin Siewert underlines the suite\u00b4s synesthetic character, such as by casting acoustic shadows in places where the video image builds on musical parameters such as rhythm, timbre and tonality. When the color and brightness of individual images are modulated in the reprise, the three episodes independently sample a range of more abstract visual characteristics.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iC45lerSkfVw07O0OBotXhNokkX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
