It argues that the magic bullet that hit JFK and Governor John Connally was in fact possible. The documentary also features other home movies taken on the day.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vzQICVAfko1BRfVoZ7uSqqwoOgN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
