The film, shot in black-and-white, stars Tarek Aylouch, Michael Markiewicz, and the Israeli-born American actress Natalie Portman. The film was commissioned by Dior, for which Portman is a spokesmodel, for the Miss Dior Expo at the Grand Palais, Paris. Shirin Neshat said that the film is a tribute to the black-and-white silent films made by such surrealist filmmakers as Man Ray, Jean Cocteau, Luis Bu\u00f1uel, and Maya Deren. The film traces the delusions of a young woman, played by Natalie Portman. She is making futile attempts to follow a phantom travelling through the dunes of an empty sea beach, and, when it comes to an encounter in an abandoned house at the end, the woman finds a disturbing surprise.  A 2-minute version commissioned as a trailer for the Viennale Film Festival also exists under the same name.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Natalie Portman ()", "Tarek Aylouch ()", "Michael Markiewicz ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
