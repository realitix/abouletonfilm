Marc\u2019s smart but relatable comedy demonstrates a universal appeal that has landed him appearances on PBS, Comics Unleashed, The Latino Laugh Festival and the Showtime special, Goin\u2019 Native. Funny not filthy, Marc serves audiences his original comedy recipe, specially prepared for non- stop laughs. Tasty topics, spicy premises and savory punchlines, are all dished out with a dash of sarcasm and a grain of salt. A regular in Las Vegas, Marc has performed six times overseas for Armed Forces Entertainment and he\u2019s a past winner of Ventura Comedy Festival\u2019s Funniest Person Contest.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
