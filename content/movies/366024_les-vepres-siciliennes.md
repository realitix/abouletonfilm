She turns to the partisan Jean Procida and the rebellious patriot Henri in her bid for vengeance.  Les V\u00eapres siciliennes is one of Verdi\u2019s lesser-known mature operas, but was vital to his development as a composer. It was created for the Paris Op\u00e9ra in 1855, providing Verdi with an opportunity to embrace the elaborate style and traditions of French grand opera.  First seen at the Royal Opera House in 2013, this staging of Verdi's rarely-performed opera Les V\u00eapres siciliennes \u2013 directed by Stefan Herheim and conducted by The Royal Opera\u2019s Music Director, Verdi specialist Sir Antonio Pappano \u2013 went on to win the prestigious Olivier Award for Best New Opera Production.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vRlESGhMVJJ2WvoEPtbl7qj6GDU.jpg", "actors": ["Lianna Haroutounian (La duchesse H\u00e9l\u00e8ne)", "Michael Volle (Guy de Montfort)", "Bryan Hymel (Henri)", "Erwin Schrott (Jean Procida)", "Neal Cooper (Thibault)", "Jihoon Kim (Robert)", "Jean Teitgen (Le sire de B\u00e9thune)", "Jeremy White (Le comte de Vaudemont)", "Nico Darmanin (Dani\u00e9li)", "Michelle Daly (Ninetta)", "Jung Soo Yun (Mainfroid)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
