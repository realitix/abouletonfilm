Blue or stag movies were produced secretly in homes, the film washed in bathtubs, then circulated discreetly, because it was a felony to be caught viewing or possessing them. Several of the shorts in this collection begin with the protective disclaimer \"This picture has been produced expressly for students of the graphic arts and is not intended for public exhibition.\" This collection ranges from the artfully erotic (The Golden Girl) to the completely bizarre (Starlets Model Unusual Hosiery).", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
