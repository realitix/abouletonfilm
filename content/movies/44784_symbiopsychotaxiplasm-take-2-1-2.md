In 1968, William Greaves shot several pairs of actors in a scene in which a woman confronts her husband and ends their relationship. In \"Take 2 1/2,\" Greaves starts with 1968 takes of one of these pairs of actors plus footage of the crew discussing the film's progress. Then, 35 years later, Greaves brings back to Central Park those actors and some of the original crew (plus others) to film a reunion of the characters Alice and Freddie. We watch scenes of these characters and discussions among the actors and crew. Greaves explores and dramatizes the dialectic in the creative process.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hROQQ0qPuydl3OvkrV6lNsPEEHM.jpg", "actors": ["William Greaves (Himself)", "Steve Buscemi (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
