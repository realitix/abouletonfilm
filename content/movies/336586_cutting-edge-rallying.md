But the Group A cars that followed provided their own surprises and in the 1990s, it all changed again as Group A evolved in the face of a restyled World Rally competition. We take a rare 'inside view' of the top rally cars of the early/mid Nineties - joining top teams in their workshops and testing; talking to drivers and team managers; and enjoying the culmination of their efforts with action footage from the international rally circuit. Featuring Mitsubishi, Subaru and Ford with McRae, Sainz, Erikkson, Makinen and Burns.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eUiTTVdOSPo83FyDLc3s94RQicx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
