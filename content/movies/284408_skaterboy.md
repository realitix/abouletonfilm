He's out to win a European skateboard contest. Two guys stand between him and skater infamy. Straight Kevin... a fit, homophobic, hardcore skater with bad attitude. And Fuzz... Spike's dirty sk8 m8 with a cock that's never in his boxers. They're all headed for Amsterdam and a heap of trouble! Shoplift bust, warehouse gangbang, cockring chaos, and two-into-one does go.. Max Lincoln's gang of punky Skater Boys get stoned and boned against the stark industrial backdrop to a Drum 'n' Bass and Hard House soundtrack. Fuzz comes out on top... Spike's mastered the backside flip, but Kevin turns a final switch that leaves the boys stunned!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["James Alexander (Spike)", "Darian Hawke (Fuzz)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
