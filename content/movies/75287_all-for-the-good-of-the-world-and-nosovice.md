The village, hitherto famous mostly for its sauerkraut and the \u201cRadegast\u201d beer was thus turned into an industrial zone \u2013 the largest greenfield investment project in the Czech Republic\u2019s history. Nonetheless, for a long time many farmers resisted selling the land upon which the factory was now standing. Eventually, they all succumbed under the pressure from the neighbours, and even the anonymous death threats. The filmmakers returned to No\u0161ovice two years after the dramatic property buyouts, at the time when the factory has just started churning out cheap cars. Combining the perspectives of seven characters, they have composed a portrayal of a place suddenly changed beyond recognition that is playful and chilling at the same time: a politically engaged absurd flick about a field that yields cars.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lzrvEBizC0XhAOiDmkdoJxghrqx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [75283], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
