His once comfortable family life has been replaced by a never-ending tour of service stations that offer him shelter, anonymity, washing facilities and food. The story follows his journey south from Scotland on his annual pilgrimage to a temporary Christmas shelter in London where he finds comfort, friendship and warmth. Over the course of his Homeric journey, Hector decides to reconnect with his long estranged past. As his previous life catches up with him, the story of how he came to be leading a marginal life begins to emerge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6TXtmcu56lte0gv2EsAS4sqOIaZ.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Mullan (Hector McAdam)", "Keith Allen (Jimbo)", "Natalie Gavin (Hazel)", "Ewan Stewart (Peter)", "Sarah Solemani (Sara)", "Laurie Ventry (Dougie)", "Stephen Tompkinson (Derek)", "Gina McKee (Lizzie)", "Sharon Rooney (Young Mother)", "James Tarpey (Ted)", "John Colleary (Sol)", "Christine Tremarco (Kate, Cafe Proprietor)", "Ashley McGuire (Chiropodist)", "Anna Bolton (Showroom Receptionist)", "Finlay McLean (Laurie 'Neeshy' McNeish)", "Hardeep Singh Kohli (Newsagent)", "Jamie Michie (Davey)", "Darren Connolly (War Veteran)", "Charity Trimm (Paramedic)", "Reaghan Reilly (Police Officer)", "Anita Vettesse (Till Lady)", "Emily Barker (Shelter Entertainer No.1)", "Fabs Latham (Shelter Entertainer #2)", "Olivia Jewson (Shelter Volunteer)", "Janet Dawe (Shelter Volunteer)", "Craig J.
