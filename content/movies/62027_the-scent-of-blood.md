But they wearily live their relationship separately; while she lives in their original flat in Rome, he lives with a young lover, L\u00f9 from time to time in his house in the country while writing a book. He does not keep his relationship hidden from his wife and even accepts that Silvia may have lovers, among them in particular a young and violent neo-fascist. But this relationship rekindles Carlo's jealousy and he becomes obsessed by knowing everything about her affairs and jealousy makes him blind. The film navigates between eroticism, decadence and perversion, in an obscure game with no wins or winners.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mYZ8JITgg7gBb0D7YvY1TWHKqSe.jpg", "actors": ["Fanny Ardant (Silvia)", "Michele Placido (Carlo)", "Giovanna Giuliani (L\u00f9)", "Riccardo Scamarcio ()", "Sergio Tramonti (Sergio)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
