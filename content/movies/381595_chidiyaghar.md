The story is about Kesari his two sons, Gomukh and Ghotak, their respective wives, Mayuri and Koel, younger son Kapi, grandchildren Gillu and Gaj, daughter Maina and Son in law Tota. Coincidentally their names resemble animals as is the case of every individual bearing some or the other animal's characteristic. There are some who're restless like monkeys and then there are others who'd have an appetite like elephants; some would be swift as a horse and then there'd be some as slow as a donkey. The journey from a four legged creature to a two legged one inculcating basics of human values like love, respect for others, patience and the true meaning of a family and togetherness is what makes us humans. This show showcases the very journey.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
