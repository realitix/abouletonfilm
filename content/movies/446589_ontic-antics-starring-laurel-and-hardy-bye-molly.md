Prior to this digital version, Jacobs presented this film as one of his live \"nervous system\" performances, projecting identical overlapping frames in a slightly asynchronous manner to create the illusion of three-dimensional effects. This creation carries the filmmaker's live performances into the digital realm through a patent-pending \"Eternalism\" technique, which doesn't require Jacobs' physical presence at each projection. In Ontic Antics, Jacobs extends his ongoing exploration of the teeming depths of life contained within individual frames of film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g03AWfpI82l8ll8mYQYSVNGGEKF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
