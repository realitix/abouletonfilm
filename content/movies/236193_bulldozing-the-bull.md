He finds himself accidentally in the toreador box, even though he doesn't want to fight because it's cruelty to animals. Popeye rides the bull like a bronco, then gets tossed around a bit. The bull plants Popeye in the ground and attacks; the crowd turns on Popeye. Olive comes down to help and the bull chases her. The crowd throws vegetables at Popeye, including (fortunately) spinach.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2R885bChkjWO6K0ATgivAbRq5MZ.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Mercer (Popeye)", "Margie Hines (Olive Oyl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
