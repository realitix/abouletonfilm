Add 40 knot winds, 10 foot waves and frigid temperatures to a storm ravaged freshwater sea and they'll tell you it's a recipe for fun. Join filmmaker and surfer Vince Deur on a road trip around 5 great lakes to meet the surfers who have made surfing these stormy waters a way of life for over 40 years.  Unsalted reflects an adventure of the spirit, it makes the case for unwavering optimism in the face of adversity, and it makes this landlocked group of surfers just a little better for it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nFdvCfSsDlbOfSq3uMQ3wXSqw3Y.jpg", "actors": ["Bron Huessenstamm (Himself)", "Colin McPhilips (Himself)", "Joe Curren (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
