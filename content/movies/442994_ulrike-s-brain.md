Inside the box: the brain of Ulrike Meinhof, which was saved by the authorities along with the brains of the three other leaders of the RAF after their deaths in Stammheim prison. Doctor Feifer can communicate telepathically with Ulrike\u2019s brain, which is directing her to lead a new feminist revolution. To that end, she is searching for the ideal female body to transplant Ulrike\u2019s brain into. At the same time, her arch-rival, Detlev Schlesinger, an extreme right-wing ideologue, arrives at the conference with the ashes of Michael K\u00fchnen, the former German neo-Nazi leader and infamous homosexual who died of AIDS in 1989. When the two Frankenstein\u2019s monsters of the extreme left and the extreme right meet, chaos ensues.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u5oMtms4G0ZA04vni9y2nsPE6yz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
