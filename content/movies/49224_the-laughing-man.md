Dressed in his military jungle uniform (with his Second World War decorations) he waxes eloquent about the \"colors\" of South Africa, \"explains\" apartheid, and freely discusses his \"adventures\". Shots of corpses, tortures, and executions of Blacks are intercut. It is not often that one can see and hear a real, \"live\" Nazi in action, talking (more or less) freely because he presumed him-self to be among friends instead of with two of the most cleverpolitical propagandists of our time, working for the other side.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fsgpNC3Zhi4AcvU7IljkA8TXhVj.jpg", "actors": ["Siegfried M\u00fcller (Himself)", "Hermann Herlinghaus (Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
