BROKEN SIDE OF TIME is the story of Dolce, one of the models who've made a career of it. But now 30, and tired of competing with 18-year-olds, Dolce realizes what makes her feel most alive is also killing her. Before starting a new career behind the camera, she embarks on a long road trip home, shooting with her favorite photographers one last time, and shedding her lifestyle-acquired vices along the way. Combing real photoshoots shot cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9-style with a narrative based on some very real-life adventures in front of the lens, BROKEN SIDE OF TIME is a dark, sexual glimpse into a world never before captured in a film. A world where any woman can play the role of a model, and any man can be a photographer, and where even the best of them must consider whether the fame and money is worth the cost.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bUNQobUACsC2azYrGYiBcUWMKgG.jpg", "actors": ["Lynn Mancinelli (Dolce / Jane)", "Audria Ayers (Viral)", "Olivia Whelan (Maggie Stinson)", "Jessica Mazo (Alisa)", "Marcin Paluch (Zach)", "Alex Brown (Bathroom hookup)", "Monique Demopoulos (Fresh)", "Peter Lynch (Guy With Camera #2)", "Kevin Gilligan (Gary)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "-eK8sAhM9us"}
