She lives together with her sisters Amy (Loretta Blake) and Jane (Dorothy West) and are all deprived by bad conditions at work and sickness. Louise tries for the three of them to survive and regards herself as the keeper of her sisters.  Meanwhile, she stands up to her bosses and complains about the dreadful circumstances they work in. When Amy is seduced by the son of the shop-owner, Louise butts in and stops the romance. He eventually abandons Amy and becomes seriously injured in a cave-in. Louise has a secret crush on the son herself and tries to rescue him, hoping he will admit he loves her.  The film is inspired by the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, which took place in 1911. The only version of the film is a nitrate print in the Cinematheque Francaise, but only the first half remains.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xFw0gXBrX7nhHCLMTxtrGFTOpkU.jpg", "actors": ["Mary Pickford (Louise)", "Loretta Blake (Amy)", "Dorothy West (Jane)", "John Bowers (Owen Wharton)", "Robert Cain (Ernest Wharton)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
