Wen Hui hadn\u2019t known of her existence until 2011; for her father had never mentioned this grandmother to her in his life. In early 2011, Wen Hui returned to his hometown in Yunnan to trace his family history, and for the first time met Su Meiling the Third Grandmother, then 84 years old, in a mountain-surrounded village called Dahebian. She seemed to have been waiting for her for the past 50 years. She told Wen Hui the family\u2019s history, and resultingly, stories and the purest of unconscious feelings emerged from the heart of Wen Hui.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zdTU6uX7eHG4npdjJxMtR7yo7qI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
