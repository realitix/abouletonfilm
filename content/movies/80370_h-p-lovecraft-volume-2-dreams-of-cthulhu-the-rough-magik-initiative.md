Diana Armitage, with the help of her Home Office liason, the mysterious Mr. Moon (Paul Darrow), launches an aggressive campaign against the Dreamers. This operation designated the Rough Magik initiative, was successful but they trod on the toes of some powerful people, and the Night Scholars were disbanded.
