We've got Black Friends! Two rich clueless film school graduates \"the Filmfakers\" are shooting a \"ghetto\" interpretation of an ancient Greek play with the Gangsta Sistas (Olivia Wilde: Alpha Dog, The OC &amp; Megalyn Echiwunwoke:24, That 70's Show) on the mean streets of Los Angeles. Their equipment is \"borrowed\" by three street youths, \"the camjackers\" who use it to shoot a compelling documentary on underground hip-hop. The filmfakers rep off the camjackers' film and rise to fame and fortune, but when the camjackers see their stolen film on TV, they must seek revenge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vRp4I2db8DTiGEwcpuVIP9SUtKw.jpg", "actors": ["Olivia Wilde (Sista Strada Cast)", "Megalyn Echikunwoke (Sista Strada Cast)", "Phoenix Orion (Camjacker #1)", "Cody Lucich (Camjacker #2)", "Brittany Krall (Starlet)", "Jeremy Fels (Whack Filmmaker #2)", "Tao Ruspoli (Whack Filmmaker #1)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
