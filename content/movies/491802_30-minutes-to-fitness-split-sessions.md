Workout One focuses on strengthening and sculpting a beautiful upper body. This gym-style session flows continuously from one muscle group to the next with challenging and effective moves. As is typical with Kelly's workouts, every minute is used productively to make each of the 30 minutes worth many more. Workout Two is designed to strengthen and re-shape your lower body. You'll trim down your legs, firm up your glutes and burn maximum calories long after the workout has ended.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qaSoClqBrPw8iyq32G2WG1qLrTn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
