Many scenes were filmed several times with only slight variations. The shots have been edited into two seemingly identical films, but this is in fact not the case. While the students involved in the creative process compare their works with the models, the viewer examines the differences between the two films projected side by side.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
