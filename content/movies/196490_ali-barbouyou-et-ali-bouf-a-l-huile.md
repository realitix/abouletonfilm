The opening title card explains that a painter has just finished his work when his assistant comes in and accidentally drinks varnish. The film then picks up as the painter goes haywire and sends the assistant into the painting.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4AH192X1fJno3pkGfKNilTYxDxS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [196534, 182344, 196625, 196396], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
