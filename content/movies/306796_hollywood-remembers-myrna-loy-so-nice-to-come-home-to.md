Turner walks us through Loy's career as a dancer and an actress miscast as an exotic. She comes into her own as a grown-up women: shrewd, funny, decorous, and sexy - in \"Manhattan Melodrama\" and \"The Thin Man.\" Her volunteer work during World War II, later stage work, and progressive politics come in for admiration as well. It's her style - seen best in her roles as a wife of charm and independence - that's captured and celebrated here.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5Mfx1jK4jxIg8hwruZEOTaGwZoW.jpg", "actors": ["Kathleen Turner (Herself - Host)", "G.
