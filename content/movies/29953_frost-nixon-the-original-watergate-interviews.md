Nixon, was originally broadcast in May of 1977. Never before, nor since, has a U.S. President been so candid on camera. Even more intriguing is the fact that Nixon agreed to appear on camera with no pre-interview preparation or screening of questions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jndArAMT1E0B276fQHuBvHxF7fM.jpg", "actors": ["David Frost (himself)", "Richard Nixon (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [29044], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
