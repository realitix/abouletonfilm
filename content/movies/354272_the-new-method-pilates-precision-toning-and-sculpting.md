One for toning and one for sculpting your body. Each workout targets specific areas of your body and includes moves for all ages and skill levels. This DVD will allow you to concentrate on those areas that you feel need the most attention. Imagine - toned, firm and flatter abs without tiresome sit-ups or crunches! Define you buns and legs without lunges, squats or expensive machines. Sculpt your chest, shoulders and arms without push-ups, heavy weights or boring repetitions. Precision Pilates is over an hour and a half of deep muscle techniques and mat-based exercises for an overall toning and sculpting regimen. It's like getting 2 DVD's for the price of one. You'll feel great and see results fast!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rwuPSVqJnjBGRGQLR3rC4KUEQuR.jpg", "actors": ["Jennifer Kries (Jennifer Kries)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
