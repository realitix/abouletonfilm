But, long isolated by geography and politics, the people struggle to survive and the center of their culture, the fifteenth century monasteries and the art within are dangerously close to collapse. Mustang - Journey of Transformation, tells the compelling story of the efforts to rescue this ancient place from the brink of extinction and help spark a cultural renaissance. Storytellers include His Holiness the Dalai Lama; the King of Mustang; and Luigi Fieni, the chief art restorer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r8kuCHBRMqAZBPiyegB7xAdZMUK.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Gere (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
