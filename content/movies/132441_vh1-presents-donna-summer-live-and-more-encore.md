The two new studio cuts that round out the disc are OK at best, although they do display Summer's ability to adapt to changes in pop-dance sounds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g03D8BPP6aYzvBromEWz13SRczt.jpg", "actors": ["Donna Summer (Herself)", "Tina Arena (Herself)", "Bruce Sudano (Backing Singer)", "Mary Ellen Bernard (Backing Singer)", "John Billings (Bass Player)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "RZ3eZ6SZ8fA"}
