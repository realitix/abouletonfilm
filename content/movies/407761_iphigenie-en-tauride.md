The story recounts the nearly fatal brother-sister relationship, its ultimate reconciliation, and the eventual Scythian-Greek truce as achieved by the intervening hand of the goddess Diana. The home video release Iphigenie en Tauride contains a film of a live performance of the work, as mounted by the Opernhaus Zurich in 2001. Claus Guth directs for the stage, with a cast that includes Juliette Galstian as Iphigenia, Rodney Gilfry as Orestes and Martina Jankov\u00e1 as Diana. The Zurich Opera's Orchestra La Scintilla and the Chorus of the Opernhaus Zurich provide musical accompaniment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pzvbFmr0d2yxaIXExYjXDG9ItJk.jpg", "actors": ["William Christie (Conductor)", "Juliette Galstian ()", "Eleanor Paunovic ()", "Rodney Gilfry ()", "Michael Mrosek ()", "Deon Van Der Walt ()", "Thomas P\u00fctz ()", "Anton Scharinger ()", "Paul Lorenger ()", "Martina Jankov\u00e1 ()", "Catherine Villiger ()", "Anna Soranno ()", "Bernhard Rubin ()", "Lisa Lorenz ()", "Eva Zmekova ()", "William Christie ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
