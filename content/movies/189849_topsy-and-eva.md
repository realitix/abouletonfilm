When the black girl who \"jes' growed\" is auctioned as a slave but nobody will bid on her, Little Eva purchases Topsy for a nickel. That's the one part of this movie that I found plausible: slaveholders often refused to buy children, since their upkeep in food usually exceeded any labour they performed. There's a gooey romantic subplot between Mariette (the niece of Simon Legree) and George Shelby, son of a prominent slaveholder.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/23Fn3Co1a7ONEyuqBCvrEjC89X0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
