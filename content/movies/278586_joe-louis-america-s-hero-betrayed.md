Traces the career of Joe Louis (1914-1981) within the context of American racial consciousness: his difficulty getting big fights early in his career, the pride of African-Americans in his prowess, the shift of White sentiment toward Louis as Hitler came to power, Louis's patriotism during World War II, and the hounding of Louis by the IRS for the following 15 years. In his last years, he's a casino greeter, a drug user, and the occasional object of scorn for young Turks like Muhammad Ali. Appreciative comment comes from boxing scholars, Louis's son Joe Jr., friends, and icons like Maya Angelou, Dick Gregory, and Bill Cosby.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6jnDxz35UpPiu1AziVUYY5aYaO8.jpg", "actors": ["Joe Louis (Himself (archive footage))", "Joe Louis Barrow Jr. (Himself)", "Dick Gregory (Himself)", "Jack Johnson (Himself (archive footage))", "Liev Schreiber (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
