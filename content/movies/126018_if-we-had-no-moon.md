Life, if it had started at all, would be in its earliest stages of evolution. Days would last four hours, winds would blow at hurricane force and there would be a dense and toxic atmosphere resembling that of Venus.  Around 50 million years after the formation of the solar system, a Mars-sized planet called Theia hit the newly formed Proto-Earth. The blast sent planetary material from the pair into orbit around earth which eventually formed the Moon.  In this one-hour special, viewers learn what Earth was like before the moon creating impact, and what Earth would have been like if the moon had never existed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1NENxSY5QDztJbJwMbotPWeEJSx.jpg", "actors": ["Patrick Stewart (Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
