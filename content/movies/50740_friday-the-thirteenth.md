Suddenly, lightning strikes, and a vast crane above topples into the path of the oncoming bus... Then Big Ben begins to wind backwards. Time recedes. And we discover the lives of all the passengers and the events that brought them to that late-night bus journey, from the con-man with a hundred-pound cheque to the businessman's distraught and elderly wife. Time flows on, inevitably, to the crash -- and past it, as some live and some die.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j9W8pTc1ovJ7aCVH2vX4g3brsZQ.jpg", "actors": ["Jessie Matthews (Millie the Non-Stop Variety Girl)", "Sonnie Hale (Alf the Conductor)", "Muriel Aked (Miss Twigg)", "Cyril Smith (Fred the Driver)", "Richard Hulton (Johnny)", "Max Miller (Joe)", "Alfred Drayton (The Detective)", "Ursula Jeans (Eileen Jackson)", "Edmund Gwenn (Mr Wakefield)", "Ralph Richardson (Horace Dawes)", "Gibb McLaughlin (Florist)", "D.A.
