A ghoulish array of costumes, make up, and decoration descend on communities every year on October 31st, but few people are aware of how the celebration came to exist. Harry Smith attempts to get to the bottom of the mystery in THE HAUNTED HISTORY OF HALLOWEEN, which delves into the 3,000 years of hoopla that traditionally unfolds when October comes around. As the history is explained, so are various failed attempts to co-opt the festival by various religious groups; but the most compelling revelation is how little the festival has changed over the centuries. A marvelous way to gain a historical perspective on this entertaining holiday, Smith's program is almost as fun as carving a pumpkin, donning a spooky costume, and undertaking a little trick or treating!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2K8D6ynG4oFmNpxTL7mHBITOmpD.jpg", "actors": ["Jamie Lee Curtis (Herself)", "Garrison Keillor (Himself)", "Art Linkletter (Himself)", "Liza Minnelli (Herself)", "Harry Smith (Host / Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
