Set across a global stage, a parade of four legged talent struts its stuff against the backdrop of some great classical works. A live action 'Fantasia' features mighty whales breaching, charging elephants, the big cats, and dozens of favourites performing with the symphony orchestra. A highly original event which will thrill everyone, particularly those who share a growing concern for the health of the planet.  -  Pamela Rabe", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/58N6bvLq7NIm092IsHNAPOP5Ljf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
