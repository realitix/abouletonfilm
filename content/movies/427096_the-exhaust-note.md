Open iron pit mines in the Austrian Alps, hydropower stations in the Atlantic-Pyrenees, and other mountainous locations in the Basque Country harbor floating concert stages, helicopter and motorbike TV transmission units, exhausted bike riders and shouting aficionados, enduro racers, rally cars, flying models, and do-it-yourself soap boxes. All of these mechanized bodies in direct contact with landscapes actively transfigure the territory.\" Anthology Film Archives on the V\u00e1zquez/Arrieta films.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
