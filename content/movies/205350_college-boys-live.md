Their new home is CollegeBoysLive.com, a voyeur web cam house rigged with 32 cameras, where their every move is watched by thousands of paying members. The site's creator claims CollegeBoysLive.com is simply about showing that \"it's okay to be gay.\" But the neighbors insist it's a pornographic whorehouse and sue to have them evicted. This intimate and provocative documentary examines a complex subculture, but at its heart is the universal search for family and acceptance", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nM3UfT0x4W5uSpNkJh0ZHoOjXVs.jpg", "actors": ["Zac Adams (Zac Adams)", "Jonathan Greer (Jonathan Greer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "X_Ll-yh-cZU"}
