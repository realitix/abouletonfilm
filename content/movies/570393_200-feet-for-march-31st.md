It is divided in six episodes following an ancient Indian text, Katha Upanishad, in which a youth, Nakiketa, converses with Death. Every section presents an event of that day and refers to a writer and a painter. The film captures some of the excitement of Spring 1968 in Europe and elsewhere.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5hPd29Qdn4qUACZWAy3xOu5e1qX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
