His reason for returning is a job offer: to find and record places free from man-made sound. His quest takes him away from towns and villages into remote terrain. Throughout his journey, he is drawn into a series of encounters and conversations which gradually divert his attention towards a more intangible silence, one that is bound up with the sounds of the life he had left behind. Influenced by elements of folklore and archive, \u201cSilence\u201d unfolds with a quiet intensity, where poetic images reveal an absorbing meditation on themes relating to sound and silence, history, memory and exile.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nvzjOYf5SmcEECDnAlINK0PCL9R.jpg", "actors": ["Eoghan Mac Giolla Bhride (Eogan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "_ezydfR4JM0"}
