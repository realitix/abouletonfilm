For instance, 71% of pregnant teenagers live in a fatherless home. Additionally, 85% of young men in prison grew up without a dad. They are not stats, they are desperate for stability. From small town American to the heart of New York City, 'Becoming Sons &amp; Daughters' tells the stories of people who are stepping into the lives of fatherless kids. Through adoption, mentoring, and simply paying attention, these men and women are planting hope and security. They are giving kids a future and helping them become sons and daughters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6ZSGAXNNYIDziI3UMqaQWUGcxXi.jpg", "actors": ["Chris Travis (Chris Travis)", "Wendy Bennett (Wendy Bennett)", "Kaylann Badgley (Kaylann Badgley)", "Matt Mueller (Matt Mueller)", "Chris Keith (Chris Keith)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "tZZ87JuT1zg"}
