Jamie and Kacie have been dating for four years, and are separately beginning to feel the affects of malaise and disconnect. As they drift apart from one another and struggle to bridge the gaps growing between them, Jamie begins to develop feelings for another woman. After precariously flirting with infidelity, Jamie abandons this new pursuit and attempts to salvage his relationship with Kacie, only to discover that she too has fallen for someone else.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v5FYQx8GEIZwrK9Fqh7emrNL1Je.jpg", "actors": ["Zach White (Jamie)", "Taylor Hastings (Kacie)", "Jennifer Kobelt (Cassandra)", "Arianna McGregor (Laura)", "Dayleigh Nelson (Eli)", "Ian McAndrew (Alexander)", "Teresa Laverty (Ellen)", "Aaron Turner (Lonnie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "UkMxxjbX_nA"}
