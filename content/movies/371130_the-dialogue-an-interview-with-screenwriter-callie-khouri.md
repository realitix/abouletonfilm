It was the Kentucky native's first attempt at a screenplay. In this enlightening interview, Khouri describes how spending years doing music video production in the '80s inspired her not only to write, but to write with a purpose. A passionate activist with a resume that includes Something to Talk About and her adaptation of Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, which she also directed, Khouri discusses in detail the pressure of living up to such early acclaim, what it's like to be a woman in the industry, and how the state of the world around you fuels and shapes your creative mindset. Also a frequent script doctor and former Writers Guild of America board member, Khouri delves into the ongoing issues facing the WGA, its membership, and its much-maligned arbitration process.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
