Kazablan is an army veteran turned gang leader in the Israeli port of Jaffa who masks his feelings of bitterness with a lot of bravado. He's sweet on Rachel, a young woman who lives with her father and stepmother. The budding relationship scandalizes the neighbors (not to mention Rachel's parents) and infuriates Yanush, a middle-aged shoe store owner who wants Rachel for himself. (Yanush feels he's entitled to marry Rachel since they're both Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern European origins, whereas Kazablan is a Sephardic Jew from Morocco.) The neighborhood has something else to worry about besides the antics of Kazablan and his gang: the city wants to tear down their crumbling homes. The residents pool their resources to save their houses, but the money that's collected is stolen. When he's jailed for the theft, Kazablan must find a way to clear himself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mYHZaXPNu8IU6j0HeTkyFPHXaFB.jpg", "actors": ["Yehoram Gaon (Kazablan)", "Efrat Lavie (Rachel)", "Arieh Elias (Moshiko)", "Etti Grotes (Maryuma)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
