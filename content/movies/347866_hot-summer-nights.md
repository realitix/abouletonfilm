And they should all star Timothee Chalamet and Maika Monroe. They're electrifying in Hot Summer Nights. This film is a bit of a mess at first, tonally jarring, and feels like Scorsese/P.T.Anderson-lite at times. But if you're going to borrow, borrow from the greats. It has a great soundtrack and is surprisingly dark by the end, ending on a note both mysterious and melancholic. It's these surprising elements and a bit of depth that makes Hot Summer Nights a pleasant summer diversion. There would be no film, however, without the magnetic chemistry and charming performances by Chalamet and Monroe. Kudos should also go to the soundtrack."}], "recommandations_id": [451915, 433620, 304816, 490005]}
