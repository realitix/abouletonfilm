As a teenager, Sally was brutally raped and, even though she's buried the scars of that attack deep inside, they're slowly seeping out, poisoning her relationship with her daughter, Kelly. Sally's lifelong friend, Jackie, tries to find a way to reconcile the two of them and, in doing so, ease the guilt she feels for letting her friend down all those years ago. As the past events come to light, we witness one incredible act of bravery that forces us to examine the well of courage we all carry inside.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j10pFLdrFpxsVdw7eMHGAgiHPdk.jpg", "actors": ["Hetti Bywater ()", "Kate Ashfield ()", "Kathryn Prescott (Kelly)", "Craig Conway (Ken)", "Sarah Hoare (Young Jackie)", "Wendy Albiston (Adult Jackie)", "Ronnie Fox (Jim Brown)", "Naomi Battrick (Jean)", "Ashley McGuire (Flo Brown)", "Jo McInnes (Bet)", "Lucy Speed (Adult Sally)", "Adam Wilson (Billy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
