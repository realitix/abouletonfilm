The credit for this goes squarely to Soham who puts in a sparklingly fresh and funny performance and dances well too in his image of a very ordinary and simple boy who is scared out of his wits with the threat of death hanging over him like Damocles\u2019 sword. It feels good to finally meet a hero who is timid of his opponents, does not sport a six-abs body and is like most young men of his age.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4LPWkLq3zuwZYruZTejfVROClgg.jpg", "actors": ["Kaushik Chakraborty ()", "Soham Chakraborty ()", "Srabanti Chatterjee ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
