Having abandoned his former paramour, the daughter of his police chief, he marries a kleptomaniacal hairdresser named Nana, whom he once caught in the act of picking pockets. He then embarks on an affair with the beautiful Marta, the widow of the war profiteer Dragutin Karlo Stajner, who has left behind him a bankrupted firm, a worthless limousine, several bastards, and at least one angry woman. While Janko and Marta persistently try to divvy up what loot remains before any number of others can claim it, Karlo unexpectedly turns up alive and jumps into the middle of a fray between Marta; Karlo's lover, Julija, a Czech bar-singer; and Julija's husband Vlado, a former henchman of Karlo's who is now trying to lay claim to Stajner's limo.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iHmenf1dTNPTZ1Rw2ovppty8YQ5.jpg", "actors": ["Rene Medve\u0161ek (Janko)", "Filip \u0160ovagovi\u0107 (Stanko)", "Mustafa Nadarevi\u0107 (Karlo \u0160tajner)", "Relja Ba\u0161i\u0107 (\u0160ef policije)", "Goran Visnjic (Devetka - '9')", "Dra\u017een Kuhn (Slavek)", "Kristijan Ugrina (Mirko)", "Jelena Miholjevi\u0107 (Julija)", "Kre\u0161imir Dolen\u010di\u0107 (Doktor)", "Josip Marotti (Doktor Javor\u010di\u0107)", "Barbara Nola (Ekspert za palme)", "\u0110okica Milakovi\u0107 (General)", "Vili Matula (Vlado)", "Alma Prica (Marta)", "Nina Violi\u0107 (Nana)", "Ksenija Marinkovi\u0107 (Gitaristica)", "Sun\u010dana Zelenika (Glasovira\u010dica)", "Nata\u0161a Gospodari\u0107 (Bubnja\u010dica)", "Vanda Vujani\u0107 (Basistica)", "Drago Nusshol (Ribi\u010d)", "Nata\u0161a Mari\u010di\u0107 (Bolni\u010darka)", "Snje\u017eana Tribuson (Ljutita bolni\u010darka)", "Ivica Slivari\u0107 (\u0160ef stra\u017ee)", "Igor Kel\u010dec ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
