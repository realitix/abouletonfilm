After a brief career as a low-level military adventurer, Iheiji (Ken Ogata) decided to set up chains of brothels throughout Asia. As Japan's power in the region grew, so did his prosperity, as the man is quite literally surrounded by sex of all kinds, much of it shown onscreen. Interestingly enough, this engaging rogue was convinced that his entrepreneurship was not only personally rewarding, but was his way of doing his patriotic best to advance his country's global ambitions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/WpU1FinnFSEuXyPv6AV74N0Ula.jpg", "actors": ["Ken Ogata ()", "Mitsuko Baisho ()", "Ko Chun-Hsiung ()", "Norihei Miki ()", "Hiroyuki Konishi ()", "Sansh\u00f4 Shinsui ()", "Tetta Sugimoto ()", "Taiji Tonoyama ()", "Gen Kodama ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [325459, 350873, 200482, 265342], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
