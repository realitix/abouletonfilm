His name is M\u00e5rten, and the other child's name is Annika. She is a rough girl, with many problems. The three of them do not get along, and Yngve is a true dictator to the children's eyes. However, when the children discover that their new guardian has a crush on their teacher (Cecilia Nilsson), they do what they can to bring the two together. Soon enough, the three will discover that they have a lot more in common than they previously imagined, and together they can make their lives worth living again. This is a sweet story about life in Sweden in the mid 1900's. It is about family, love, hate, innocent friendship that we all can relate to, and much, much more...", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/byZBb0JcD5iCyRL3cLtrYPxLIVt.jpg", "actors": ["Kjell Bergqvist (Yngve Johansson)", "Anastasios Soulis (M\u00e5rten)", "Rebecca Scheja (Annika)", "Cecilia Nilsson (Miss Svanstr\u00f6m)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [27119, 245649, 145259, 22471], "youtube_key": "ni7f7VPzV0w"}
