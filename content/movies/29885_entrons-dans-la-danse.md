It stars Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Oscar Levant, Billie Burke, Gale Robbins and Jacques Fran\u00e7ois. Music is by Lennie Hayton and cinematography by Harry Stradling Sr.\r\n\r\nFred and Ginger play the Barkleys, a successful husband and wife musical comedy team that seems to thrive on feuding. However, one day it goes too far and a break up appears certain when the wife entertains an offer from Jacques Fran\u00e7ois to become a serious actress.\r\n\r\nFirsts and lasts here as it was the first film Astaire and Rogers did for MGM, their first in colour, and their last they would make together after reconvening after 10 years - Rogers stepping in when Judy Garland fell to her troubled wayside. The screenplay is pretty thin, serving only as a thin piece of meat to the dance and musical numbers sandwich, but with stand-outs like the wonderful \"Shoes with Wings On\" and the joyous uplift of 'They Can't Take That Away from Me' to spend time with, it's a film to brighten the darkest of days. 7/10"}], "recommandations_id": [160660, 43792, 43458, 120862], "youtube_key": "i6zNNPq6uCc"}
