This was one of the most modern factories in Europe. It was also a bastion of trade-unionism, one of the major hotspots of the events of May and June 1968. Decugis\u2019 film records a process of dismantlement, month-by-month, from April 2004 to March 2005. Demolition began at the downstream end, with the generating plant, then proceeded building by building. The camera remains on the opposite banks, filming the island from across the river. The narration pinpoints and expounds on what is being shown. By March 2005, \u2018deconstruction\u2019 is complete. Depollution lasts into 2006.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Michel Delahaye (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
