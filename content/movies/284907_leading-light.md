The film is shot in a room over a period of a day and records the changes in light through the single window. The image is controlled through manipulation of aperture, of shutter release, of lens, but the effect is more casual than determined and the spectator is aware primarily of the determining nature of following sunlight.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A5Bx9UtcA6G0zcYM8RxPY2f19Bs.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
