Living with injustice and oppression, many African-Americans advocated a non-violent resistance. Williams took a different tack, urging the oppressed to take up arms. Williams was stripped of his rank as leader of the local NAACP chapter, but he continued to encourage local African-Americans to carry weapons as a means of self-defense. Wanted on a kidnapping charge, Williams and his wife fled to Cuba. His radio show Radio Free Dixie could be heard in some parts of the United States.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6IevkfPCW031fid14kJ6cu9AHpa.jpg", "actors": ["Robert F.
