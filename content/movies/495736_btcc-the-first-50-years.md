Over the last 50 years, the British Touring Car Championship has entertained more people than any other domestic series, with great racing, great personalities and often more than a dash of controversy. Over that time, the series has changed from a largely amateur affair, using standard road cars, to the sophisticated professional enterprise of the 21st century. From the varied archives of 50 years of racing and the reminiscences of several of the 32 champions, this exclusive DVD traces those changes and relives some of the amazing events that have made the British Touring Car Championship the iconic and exhilarating racing competition it is today. Complete with a bonus DVD showing some of the all time classic races, this 2 disc DVD is a must for any BTCC fan!.... \"Four hours of fun\" Autosport", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/agivHfpX2ZB10aKuNH6MFyB2pnx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
