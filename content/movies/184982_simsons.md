The town is famous for scallops and curling, and peoples' status in this little fishing village is based on their curling abilities. The girls do little, until a seemingly inept coach teaches them about the game, and about themselves. In the end, they pull it all together to become an adequate team. In the process, they discover the true meaning of friendship, effort, shame and puppy love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6LRTPwb9xdahrJ7IaggdAaoBF1I.jpg", "actors": ["Rosa Kat\u00f4 (Kazuko Ito)", "Mina Fujii (Miki Onaka)", "Nanase Hoshii (Natsumi Ono)", "Mai Takahashi (Fumie Hayashida)", "Yo Oizumi (Heita Omiya)", "Kei Tanaka (Masato Kaga)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
