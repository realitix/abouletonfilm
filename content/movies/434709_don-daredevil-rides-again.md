Zorro simply became \"Don Daredevil\" (Ken Curtis), a foppish Easterner by day turned masked avenger by night. Like his not too distant relative, Don wore his disguise in order to battle nasty Roy Barcroft who, under a forged Spanish land grant, attempts to take over the surrounding ranch land.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lnPcVB7ZkYNQSo2u83nGGFJngvw.jpg", "actors": ["Ken Curtis (Lee Hadley / Don Daredevil)", "Aline Towne (Patricia Doyle)", "Roy Barcroft (Douglas Stratton)", "Lane Bradford (Henchman Weber)", "Robert Einer (Gary Taylor)", "John L.
