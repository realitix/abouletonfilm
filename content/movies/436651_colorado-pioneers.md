Instead it's a sort of Reform School Western about a couple of wayward Chicago boys (Billy Cummings and Freddie Chapman) taken in by Ryder's indomitable aunt, \"The Duchess\" (Alice Fleming.) The boys escaped their very own \"Fagin,\" Bull Reagan (Roy Barcroft), and were given a second chance on the lady's Western ranch. Unfortunately, Reagan returns to do a bit of cattle rustling, once again luring the boys into becoming his accomplices.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Aex5ObkaSFOpIqPZWvHTLotXDFz.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Elliott (Red Ryder (as Wild Bill Elliott))", "Robert Blake (Little Beaver (as Bobby Blake))", "Alice Fleming (The Duchess)", "Roy Barcroft (Bull Reagan)", "Bud Geary (Henchman Bill Slade)", "Billy Cummings (Joe, Parish Boy)", "Freddie Chapman (Skinny, Parish Boy)", "Frank Jaquet (Dave Wyatt)", "Tom London (Sand Snipe)", "Monte Hale (Cowhand That Quits)", "Billie Thomas (Smokey, Parish Boy (as Buckwheat Thomas))", "George Chesebro (Hank Disher)", "Emmett Vogan (Judge)", "Tom Chatterton (Father Marion)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
