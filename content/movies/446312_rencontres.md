It is the start of a whirlwind romance which looks like it might last beyond the end of the summer. Unfortunately, Bella is already married, to Carl Krastner, a once renowned pianist who has become bitter and reclusive after a car accident that irreparably damaged one of his hands. Krastner no longer has any zest for living. He tyrannises both his wife and his sister Laurence and divides his time between scuba diving and gambling. After ratcheting up a small fortune in gambling debts, Krastner decides to fake his own death so that he can claim on his life insurance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jNA7PCOVIh8YpR6wzdHNvYtuxCF.jpg", "actors": ["Mich\u00e8le Morgan (Bella Krasner)", "Gabriele Ferzetti (Ralph Scaffari)", "Pierre Brasseur (Carl Krasner)", "Diana Gregor (Laurence Krasner)", "Jacques Morel (David)", "Nico Pepe (Jos\u00e9)", "V\u00e9ronique Vendell (Micky)", "Solange Lafay (Paola)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
