If Japan has the best and freshest fish in the world, then Tokyo's Tsukiji Fish Market is where you're most likely to find them. It's the home of Japan's biggest daily fish auction, and it's a place of fierce competition between fish merchants that have been in the business for generations.  Based on a comic series, The Taste of Fish follows businessman Shuntaro, who has a successful career in a trading company and is in a steady relationship with girlfriend Asuka. One day, Shuntaro has to help out at the fish wholesaler store run by Asuka's father, and he immediately falls in love with the world of Tsukiji Fish Market. Soon, Shuntaro quits his job and devotes all of his time to running the business while learning about the market's fascinating set of long-standing traditions. However, he must first also learn to distinguish the tastes of different fishes before he can survive in the competitive world of Tsukiji.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pOr6xlouKUIvxk7LIqx6U3svN5p.jpg", "actors": ["Takao Osawa (Shuntaro Akagi)", "Rena Tanaka (Asuka)", "Tsuyoshi Ihara (Eiji)", "Noriko Eguchi (Eri)", "Y\u00f4ko Moriguchi (Chiaki)", "Akira Emoto (Shojiro Sanada)", "YosiYosi Arakawa (Takuya)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "sif6H9Bv9z4"}
