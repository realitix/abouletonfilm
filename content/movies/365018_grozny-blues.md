The film revolves around four women who have been fighting for human rights under worsening conditions for many years but get more and more disillusioned with the situation in Putin\u2019s Russia. The building where they work is also home to a Blues Club that is frequented by a group of young people. Having only vague memories of the Chechen wars in the 90s, they try to make sense of the strange things that are happening in their country. In linking the personal and intimate to the political, Nicola Bellucci shows in a dramatic and yet very poetic way what it means to live in a divided society that navigates a no-man\u2019s land between war and peace, repression and freedom, archaic traditions and modern life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wj3g0mgwjGBotuDJsaWd9FXOsvg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "QZEV57rGHpk"}
