Matt, a gay man in his late twenties, navigates the lonely intersection of carnal sex and human closeness. With the arrival of Luke, a new man in his life, he finds a way to reconcile pleasures of the flesh with the new aroused imperatives of the heart.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/upZPKiZUkUYMWjt6HQqw6QobICX.jpg", "actors": ["Francis Beraud (Matt the resident)", "Paul Huntley-Thomas (Luke the diabetic)", "Edwin Ray (Average Sucker)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "Thomcat", "content": "This film was released on the compliation 'Boys on Film X'. It is filled with beautiful cinematography, in particular Matt\u2019s bathroom of blue balloons and although it features only one line of dialogue \u2013 important because it cements Matt\u2019s interest in Luke, the characters are conveyed strongly and charismatically. Inflatable Swamp is an interesting study in gay male relationships and can be enjoyed by both those who seek more artsy cinema and those who enjoy cinema with engaging characters and a simple plot line."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
