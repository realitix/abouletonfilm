Ota is a retired high-school teacher and at this point in life has various foibles that complicate life for his son and daughter-in-law. Moreover, he has a complicated and risky eye operation ahead. That is why Ota decides that this is the time to look up Jana, the retired actress who had influenced the course of his life many years ago. However, his reunion with Jana - who lives in a retirement home - works out differently to his expectations. Although disappointed at first, it is actually this zestful lady who sets Ota in the right direction again. Thanks to Jana, Ota finds the courage to set out on an exciting road-movie trip of the kind he would never have had the courage for in his youth. Their meeting and the excursion, full of unexpected turns and new impressions, give their lives a new dimension.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qzATqGV3VLhoTfg5lYADd9wPjz4.jpg", "actors": ["Radoslav Brzobohat\u00fd (Ota)", "Ji\u0159ina Bohdalov\u00e1 (Jana)", "Ivan Trojan ()", "Lenka Vlas\u00e1kov\u00e1 ()", "Ji\u0159ina Jir\u00e1skov\u00e1 ()", "Ta\u0165jana Medveck\u00e1 ()", "Viktor Preiss ()", "Jan Skope\u010dek ()", "Miriam Kantorkov\u00e1 ()", "Josef Somr ()", "Tatiana Vilhelmov\u00e1 ()", "Old\u0159ich Navr\u00e1til ()", "Marek Tacl\u00edk ()", "Radek Holub ()", "Jaroslava Obermaierov\u00e1 ()", "Martin Stropnick\u00fd ()", "Radim \u0160pa\u010dek ()", "Martin Zah\u00e1lka ()", "Mat\u011bj H\u00e1dek ()", "Anna Geislerov\u00e1 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
