Her plans are interrupted when she meets Val Drakul, whose ancient ancestor was Dracula. His recurring blackouts coincide with recent grisly murders and is convinced that he is the nocturnal culprit, having fallen victim to the family curse. Intent on disproving Val's theory, Lesley brings him back to California making him part of a new group of patients suffering from phobias. But when the patients start dying one by one, questions arise as to whether Val is the vampire after all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kTOJ6DfdwA9wdDh6twug7Nzwav.jpg", "actors": ["Erica Leerhsen (Dr. Lesley Parker)", "Chase Ryan Jeffery ()", "Matthew Tompkins ()", "Stephanie Rhodes ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
