The dialog, seemingly in Swedish, is actually a Swedish-accented fictional language based on English, German, Latin, and Swedish, with most nouns ending in \"ska\". The principal character, Professor Viktor Sundqvist, 76, is being driven to a lecture at the university, when dove droppings splatter the car's windshield. Detouring at his uncle's old house, his mind wanders back to his youth, when Death came to a family picnic to claim his sister, Inga. Knowing that Death is a gambler, Viktor has Inga challenge Death to a single-point game of badminton for her life. While they are playing, a dove flies above, soiling Death's cape, and distracting him enough to miss the birdie. Having won the game, Inga is free, and she and Viktor run off for a swim in the lake.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mQa2wMSxidZ3OCRRrVRHhvF5aHP.jpg", "actors": ["David Zirlin (Chauffeur)", "George Coe (Viktor)", "Pamela Burrell (Inga)", "Peter Turgeon (Uncle Anders)", "Madeline Kahn (Sigfried)", "Tom Stone (Gustav)", "Stan Rubinstein (Olin)", "Sidney Davis (Death)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [231035, 231044, 193900, 194594], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
