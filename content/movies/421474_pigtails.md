The sea roared. And then\u2026  There is a small house solitary standing by the seaside. A young girl has been living there alone since that fateful day. Mail is no longer delivered, but even this morning, she\u2019s hanging out the laundry as usual. She\u2019s unaware that all around her, the clothes pegs are quarreling, the pillow argues with the umbrella about the outside world, and the new toothbrush is unsuccessfully trying to charm the grumpy older ones.  Do objects exist to be used until they are consumed or broken? Are they afraid of being thrown away once their life cycle is complete?  A delicate story of hope in a cruel and gentle world after an unnamed disaster.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rj4qNHQ1pK6aa0xdY0qM2U8TyfG.jpg", "actors": ["Junichi Suwabe (Talking Things)", "Yuusuke Kobayashi (Talking Things)", "Kana Hanazawa (Talking Things)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "mYZuLUBIUtA"}
