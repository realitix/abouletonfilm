Pinchworm. Everyone is amused at first, but they can no longer escape and no longer fall for the poor designs of the rides until they ride a rollercoaster which turns them into babies (both Franklin and Tika are wearing diapers) and they need to find out how to return to their original ages, even though their certain abilities are limited since they are toddlers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rlN6jQgP7tSZ2LE0nWhitDlZGyd.jpg", "actors": ["Joe Maggard (Ronald McDonald)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
