He realized then... he'd hit on something. Ask almost anyone and you'll hear, \"Communism is dead! The Berlin Wall came down.\" Thought the word communism isn't used anymore, this film will show the ideas behind it are alive and well. Join Bowers for a fascinating look at the people and groups that have successfully targeted America's morality and freedom in their effort to grind America down. It's a well documented AGENDA.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/94LNMGGhA7G3rX0pI0Lggnlz4SC.jpg", "actors": ["Curtis Bowers (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
