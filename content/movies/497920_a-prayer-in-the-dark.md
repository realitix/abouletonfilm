Though one of Emily's grown daughters, Janet feels she did not belong in the quiet, devoutly religious community and left the Quakers, Emily believed that her family ties stayed strong. Real trouble comes to the family when Jimmy Flood returns to the house after busting out of prison with the help of Digby and Lester, and he takes Emily's family hostage in exchange for $4 million.
