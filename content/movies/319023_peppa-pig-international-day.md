Madame Gazelle teaches them a song. But it's recess, and Pedro Pony, wearing an America costume, George, playing Russia, Richard Rabbit, who's dressed as Spain, and Emily Elephant , who's playing Greece, are in the sandbox. Suzy Sheep who plays Holland, and Zoe Zebra ,who plays Japan,Emily Elephant plays as South Africa, make an announcement that it is their turn in the sandbox. A fight erupts that ends up with the toddlers fitting, and Freddy Fox, who plays the United Kingdom, tries to make the peace but gets drawn into the argument. They think of Madame Gazelle, yet their fight cannot be broken up. More people join the fight, like Peppa Pig, who plays France and Emily Elephant who plays South Africa. Before long, 13 countries are fighting, and the fight spirals out of control. Candy Cat, playing Switzerland, remains neutral and makes an effort to stop them from arguing but they don't listen to her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/snPnNAjOmFpwLHUvTreuWwZROSJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
