Before Pain of Salvation entered the studio to record Be, they performed the music live over the course of several nights in front of music students and in rock clubs. A camera crew followed them around to document the performances for this DVD. \"It seems that everybody was deeply impressed,\" says creator Daniel Gildenlow. \"I think, however, in order to grasp every detail of the show one would have to watch it three or four times.\"  Be Live comes packaged with a bonus Live CD.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e2mpvfcxjatKBVjkBeStxIRArLp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
