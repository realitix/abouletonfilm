Gardner's \"Can't Yo Heah Me Callin',\" has a nice baritone and chooses to go easy on the dialect-heavy stuff (as much as one can; the song was a hit in 1914, an era of not just common but GLEEFULLY common dialect songs). The Brown Sisters do \"Underneath the Harlem Moon,\" which is of later vintage (1932) and solidly in the hi-de-ho tradition.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["The Brown Sisters ()", "Bill Powers ()", "Zazzy ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
