But he, Dushyant Kumar, is different, he is pious, worships a lot, sleeps by 8 pm, and is up at 4 am to begin his day by prayers, abstinence from all viles, especially women. Dushyant is influenced by a heart-broken Professor Vishwamitra, who failed in his love relationship with Gayetridevi, and as such has organized several male youth, and made them take a vow of celibacy. Kalidas sends his son to Mannali, where he meets with a young woman by the name of Shakuntala (Shaku), and both fall in love. When he returns home, he intends to introduce Shaku to his parents, seek their blessings and get married, but finds his life in turmoil when he sees Vishwamitra holding hands and romancing Shaku. When Vishwamitra finds out that Shaku is interested in Dushyant, he takes a vow to create misunderstandings between the two lovers, and thus marry Shaku.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yZudLxrXDVN7MmEFOh3O2QB6Uai.jpg", "actors": ["Rishi Kapoor ()", "Urmila Matondkar ()", "Anupam Kher ()", "Tiku Talsania ()", "Bindu ()", "Reema Lagoo ()", "Dinesh Hingoo ()", "Annu Kapoor ()", "Mehmood ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
