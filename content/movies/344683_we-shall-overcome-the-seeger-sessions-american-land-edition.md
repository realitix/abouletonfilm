The CD side merely contains the album. The DVD contains the album in PCM stereo (there's no 5.1 mix, although given the big-band nature of this session, this album would have sounded great in Surround Sound), along with two bonus tracks, the rollicking \"Buffalo Gals\" and the moody, soulful \"How Can I Keep from Singing.\" Both bonus cuts are excellent and should have been on the album proper. There is also a 30-minute video program that chronicles some of the recording of the album, but it's not a documentary: it's more of a performance film with commentary, and while it could have been longer or had more commentary, it's still quite enjoyable. Finally, We Shall Overcome also was released separately as a vinyl LP.]", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Bruce Springsteen (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
