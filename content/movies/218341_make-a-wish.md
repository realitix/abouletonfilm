While vacationing at a boys' camp, the rambunctious Breen befriends famed composer Basil Rathbone. Stuck for an inspiration for his latest operetta, Rathbone at last finds it when he meets Breen's gorgeous mother Marion Claire, a popular singer. Alas, her stiff-necked fiance Ralph Forbes refuses to allow her to return to the stage, whereupon Rathbone spirals into a depression -- and even worse, a profound case of writers' block. But Little-Mister-Fixit Breen manages to patch up everything just in time for Claire to debut in Rathbone's latest masterpiece. Offering much-needed comedy relief are Henry Armetta, Leon Errol and Donald Meek as a trio of parasitic would-be songwriters. Make a Wish was based on a story by Gertrude Berg, of \"Molly Goldberg\" fame.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9A4CjZK3BBm6qMw1VFvPrpb0AiW.jpg", "actors": ["Bobby Breen (Chip Winters)", "Basil Rathbone (Johnny Selden)", "Henry Armetta (Moreta)", "Donald Meek (Joseph)", "Leon Errol (Brennan)", "Billy Lee (Pee Wee)", "Ralph Forbes (Walter Mays)", "Leonid Kinskey (Moe)", "Herbert Rawlinson (Dr. Stevens)", "Spencer Charters (Station Agent)", "Johnny Arthur (Antoine)", "Lew Kelly (Mailman)", "Charles Richman (Wagner)", "Fred Scott (Minstrel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
