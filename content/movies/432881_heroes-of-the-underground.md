After his death, anti-Japanese films found new breathe especially in Taiwan. Based on a King Hu\u2019s script, Heroes Of The Underground tapped into Lee's nationalistic fervor and the Confucian ethic of country above family and starred the popular Ching Li as a World War II, Chinese secret agent planted into the Japanese Headquarters at Changsha.
