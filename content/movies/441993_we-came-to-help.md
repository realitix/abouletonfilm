It was the genocide of 800'000 people in 1994, however, that led to a rethinking of development aid. The film offers those involved at that time a chance to speak, as well as examining further the question of whether doing good always does good.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
