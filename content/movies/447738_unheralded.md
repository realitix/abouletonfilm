Across North America, newspapers are dying, but in Lakefield, Terry McQuitty, the town paper\u2019s publisher, carries on a rich, 150-year-old tradition. Set to the pace of small-town life, Unheralded is a testament to the vital role newspapers can still play, and the close bond between reporter and reader.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9J0t6gxPHEMd6VtFR5GkMtzYOkY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
