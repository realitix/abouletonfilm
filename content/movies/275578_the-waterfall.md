Over the course of a 5 day voyage they not only explore the most spectacular landscapes on earth, but embark on their own artistic response to the wilderness and to its history - in particular the legacy of William Hodges, ship's artist with Captain Cook in 1773.  The Waterfall brings some of New Zealand's most renowned contemporary artists to Fiordland, and to the screen: Gerda Leenards, John Walsh, Nigel Brown and Melvin 'Pat' Day. The story follows the artistic process of each, from the sketches \"en plain air\" to the final artwork.  A work of art in itself, The Waterfall combines good characters, a great yarn, humour and stunning imagery within the natural canvas of World Heritage Status Fiordland.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mdY5KwXA1eNKEMZ6R3MML6rJ0b2.jpg", "actors": ["Gerda Leenards (Herself)", "John Walsh (Himself)", "Nigel Brown (Himself)", "Melvin 'Pat' Day (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
