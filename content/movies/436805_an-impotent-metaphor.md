Boredom and alienation, the banality of fantasies and reality and the need for idealised romance afflict the characters that wander through this narrative representation of the LA art scene. The pervasive cultural malaise is seen as conditioned behaviour \u2014 conscious psychological manipulation by the mass media. Against this dominant ideology, the film\u2019s central figure Norman, played by Norman Yonemoto, approaches art as a means to \u2018expose the derivative nature of the romantic ideal\u2019 and \u2018promote the examination of our personal contexts.\u2019", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
