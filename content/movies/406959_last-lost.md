{"tmdb_id": 406959, "title": "Last Lost", "original_title": "Last Lost", "slug_title": "last-lost", "date": "1996-07-17", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "A film gleaned via the optical printer from a home market movie made in the late 1930's about a chimpanzee's high adventures in an amusement park at Coney Island. Central weight is given to the chimp's inscrutable gaze, indicating psycho-emotional territories informed by peculiar details that haunt the original. The resulting film is a slighlty hypnotic and open-ended parable about coming of age in a shifty world of slipping terms. LAST LOST is a silent film in spirit, trying to speak without words, like some dreams. (...) The primate of Heller's confabulation brings both peace and a sword. The reviving spirits that he releases are not easily compatible with the order of things, and such newfound awareness doesn't necessarily provide the keys to the kingdom but rather a profound uneasiness with the staple amusements and short circuitry of this provisional world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l2BYe9FF9EBnGQlDFxLIGLxeHRw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
