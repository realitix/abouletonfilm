Unlike the historic character, Elliott's gunfighter survives his encounter with the South Dakota hellhole, where he arrives to aid beleaguered livery stable owner Clint Wilson (Richard Fiske) and his sister, Madge (Dorothy Fay), in their battle against self-appointed town czar \"Flash\" Kirby (Arthur Loft). But before he gets that far, there is a little matter of proving Kirby guilty of wrongdoing and to achieve that, Wild Bill earns the enmity of both the Wilsons.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xNd5IuAzC6qCVkT0cYOg4fuxPa.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Elliott (Wild Bill Hickok)", "Richard Fiske (Clint Wilson)", "Dorothy Fay (Madge Wilson)", "Dub Taylor (Cannonball)", "Arthur Loft ('Flash' Kirby)", "Jack Roper ('Rawhide' Fenton)", "Chuck Morrison (Spike)", "Claire Rochelle (Lucy Belle)", "Al Rhein (Slats)", "Edmund Cobb (Dusty Daggett)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
