In 2006, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the creation of Candide, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris produced a new production under the direction of Robert Carsen. The production transforms the proscenium into a giant 1950s-era TV set, and has Voltaire, appearing as the narrator, changing channels between certain scenes. Carsen sets the action in a 1950s/1960s world, with an American slant commenting on contemporary world politics. This production was filmed and broadcast on Arte.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/loPxTl9gHCFvIUff44yq0ux70iZ.jpg", "actors": ["William Burden (Candide)", "Anna Christy (Cunegonde)", "Lambert Wilson (Pangloss, Martin and Voltaire)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
