As it stands, it is instead just \"Not bad\". I like these flip-the-script type crime thrillers. Of course no one's done it quite as well as _Dusk till Dawn_, but I'm always willing to give them a chance (this year's \"_Don't Breathe_\" looks like it has potential in that category as well).\r\n\r\nHenry Rollins is outstanding, but otherwise the cast is pretty low quality. It's understandable, within the confines of a movie like this, but it still has a negative impact on the tale overall. Like when a machine gun is firing but has no recoil. It doesn't make or break the movie, but it does take you out of the moment, and all these little things add up.\r\n\r\nAlso had a little bit of a _Payday_ vibe, which I appreciate.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"}], "recommandations_id": [392898, 343010, 356334, 381170]}
