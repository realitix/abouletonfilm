This movie follows a doomed character who can't seem to go a day without tripping, venturing into one misadventure after another. Yes, taking acid can make a normal routine, like going to work, seem like an odyssey, complete with monsters (toilet sharks), perils (the sidewalk turning into an inferno), and beautiful maidens. Peter Steele from Type O Negative guest stars in this unusual comedy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/96fr1HySy6384SNnJSYLlCOIGCz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
