A cortege of Arabs, about 20 persons in the party, walk past; the dignitaries are in front, attended by men with horns and drums. Coming in the other direction are local Swiss, who pay little attention, and a group of native-garbed Africans. The dozen or so well-dressed denizens of Geneva who are sitting on the steps of the Divan take it all in.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hgUTBYv381K2Hx352Fs0NAwzT2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
