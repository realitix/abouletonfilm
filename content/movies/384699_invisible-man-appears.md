Loosely based on the H.G. Wells 1897 classic novel THE INVISIBLE MAN, the Japanese take on the story, still has a scientist using a special chemical to become invisible.  The story begins when jewel thieves becomes interested in an invisibility formula invented by Professor Nakazato. The thieves kidnap the professor and want to use his invention to acquire a diamond necklace called the \u201cTears of Amour\u201c. There are a lot of twists and turns in this film, as to who is the Invisible Man and why. The Japanese Invisible Man looks just like Universal\u2019s 1933 version played by Claude Rains, with bandages and an overcoat. The formula has the same adverse symptoms which effect the nervous and drive the user insane.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mlek2utA8DDWK65TRiwpWl47tPg.jpg", "actors": ["Ry\u00fbnosuke Tsukigata (Kenz\u00f4 Nakazato)", "Chizuru Kitagawa (Machiko Nakazato)", "Takiko Mizunoe (Ry\u00fbko Mizuki)", "Daijir\u00f4 Natsukawa (Ky\u00f4suke Segi)", "Mitsusabur\u00f4 Ramon (Inspector Matsubara)", "Sh\u00f4saku Sugiyama (Ichir\u00f4 Kawabe)", "Kanji Koshiba (Shunji Kurokawa)", "Kichijir\u00f4 Ueda (Otoji Sugimoto)", "Hiroshi Ueda (Nagayoshi Tanimoto)", "Sh\u00f4z\u00f4 Nanbu (Umeo Miyazawa)", "Shinobu Araki (Yoshihira Hatanaka)", "Saburo Date (Keiz\u00f4 Sasatani)", "Tominosuke Hayama ()", "Jun Fujikawa ()", "S\u00f4ji Shibata ()", "Takeo Yano ()", "Ikkei Tamaki ()", "Takehiro Yuasa ()", "Tsuneo Katagiri ()", "Akira Shimizu ()", "Michio Yuri ()", "Akira Shiga ()", "Kyo Takigawa ()", "Saburo Goda ()", "Tomoya Yamada ()", "Teruko Omi ()", "Tomoko Takahara ()", "Namiko Rokujo ()", "Yoko Ueno ()", "Hinako Fujiwara ()", "Nobuko Shiraki ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
