Long ago in a Magic Kingdom, one misunderstood Royal Vizier will go on a quest to save his city from its bumbling sultan, an invading prince, and the most notorious thief to ever live! With the help of the Kingdom's free-spirited, teenage Princess, the Vizier must find a magical lamp containing a wish-granting Djinn (who's really funny, by the way) and defeat the city's most-wanted criminal... Aladdin! This musical adventure celebrates and lovingly pokes fun at everyone's favorite series of hand-drawn, animated films.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v8jNoc470zMYFsjzgmdeSMoz9iR.jpg", "actors": ["Dylan Saunders (Ja'far)", "Rachel Soglin (Princess)", "Jeff Blim (Aladdin)", "Meredith Stepien (Sherrezade)", "Joseph Walker (Achmed)", "Nick Gage (Sultan / Djinn)", "Jim Povolo (Captain)", "Lauren Lopez (Monkey / Ensemble)", "Jaime Lyn Beatty (Sea Witch / Ensemble)", "Denise Donovan (Bird / Ensemble)", "Robert Monion (Ensemble)", "Alex Paul (Ensemble)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [63497, 104950, 330893, 323377], "youtube_key": "jgINfwAZNAY"}
