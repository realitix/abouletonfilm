They speak different languages, but they are fatefully bound together by the solitary quest for happiness and deliverance. Sloping paths are all that's left for them in an age of lost perspectives, lost refuges and lost homelands. They sink deeper with every movement that should be liberating them. Every gesture of love becomes a gesture of humiliation. The desperate dance of their life has become a passionate dance of death.  In the centre of this centrifuge at the end of the millennium the Russian emigrant Valery and his lover Ljuba are turning around each other in a nocturnal round dance of desire and pain, hope and violence and the indestructible will to survive", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1onNRCmrJqj46AB3YxH29ukuW8U.jpg", "actors": ["Valerij Fedorenko (Valery)", "Marc Ottiker ()", "Sanja Spengler (Ljuba)", "Eddi Zacharias (Man in Bar)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
