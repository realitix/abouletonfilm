Fat Head Kids explains what kids need to know about diet and health by taking them on a journey aboard a biological starship. By seeing how the crew members are programmed to respond to foods, kids learn what makes us fat (and no, it's not just about calories), how bad food makes 'boy boobs', why food sets our mood, and why industrial food causes health problems ranging from diabetes to ADHD. Finally, kids learn how their biological starship was programmed to thrive on the Planet of Real Foods.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rGLh10wuzh4AM6d2jNKyvaaVTFa.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Naughton (Narrator)", "Grant Naughton (Mr. Spot (Voice) / Marty Metabolism (Voice))", "Kenny Naughton (Dr. Fishbones (Voice))", "Chareva Naughton (Sergeant Shockey (Voice))", "Sara Naughton (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
