The house itself is heavily decorated, mostly by Cocteau (and a bit by Picasso), and we are given an extensive tour of the artwork. Cocteau also shows us several dozen paintings as well. Most cover mythological themes, of course. He also proudly shows paintings by Edouard Dermithe and Jean Marais and plays around his own home in Villefranche. This informal little project once again shows the joy Cocteau takes in creating art, in addition to showing a side of his work (his paintings and drawings) that his films often overshadow.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6N0S9UaImu6lvFvxM35MczWXWJF.jpg", "actors": ["Jean Cocteau (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [93743], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
