Lured by adventure and easy money, these modern-day geisha find themselves caught up in the mizu shobai - the complex \"floating water world\" of Tokyo clubs and bars. Drawn by fast money, some women become consumed by the lavish lifestyle and forget why they came. One hostess calls it \"losing the plot.\" With a pulsating visual style, Tokyo Girls captures the raw energy of urban Japan and its fascination with the new. Shot in Canada, Osaka and Tokyo, this is a riveting inside look at the impact of the \"economy geisha.\" Desired mainly for her looks, the hostess is rapidly replacing the cultural institution of geisha - women trained in the ancient art of traditional entertainment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3NYIWW9TpqiSk2AvdfvJPwyegWL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
