In 2002, Phyllis Diller announced that she would be hanging up her wigs and sequins after 47 years on the road. This film captures a never-before-seen, intimate look at a trailblazer for both women and comedy. Miss Diller provides unprecedented access to her preparations for her final performance at the Suncoast Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.  This is a revealing and personal study of the art of stand-up comedy as told by an icon and a true comedic genius.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xDjFMNnJdXlSKPbS8JkxN8Tqyo3.jpg", "actors": ["Phyllis Diller (Herself)", "Marty Allen (Himself)", "Roseanne Barr (Herself)", "Red Buttons (Himself)", "Ruth Buzzi (Herself)", "Tony Danza (Himself)", "Penn Jillette (Himself)", "The Amazing Kreskin (Himself)", "Don Rickles (Himself)", "Rip Taylor (Himself)", "Lily Tomlin (Herself)", "David Brenner (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "iNKoj84WG7E"}
