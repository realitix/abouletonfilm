Inspired by the banality of 1960's television, Chamberlain wrote and directed Brand X, an 87 minute series of faux television shows spoofing the politics and mass media of the day, complete with commercials for Sex, Sweat, Computer Dating and Peanut Butter. BRAND X follows Taylor Mead through a day in a wacky television studio as he portrays an exercise guru, a talk show host, a veteran returning from the American Civil War, a hospital patient in a soap opera, the President of the United States and a televangelist giving the Nightly Sermon. BRAND X satirizes President Nixon, the Vietnam War, sex, drugs, computers, money and race relations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sIAHwpDBDaMJ5zGwpzWBPw6eUZ8.jpg", "actors": ["Taylor Mead (Viewer / President / Minster / Nurse)", "Sally Kirkland (Patient / President's Wife)", "Abbie Hoffman (Policeman (Lawren Order))", "Candy Darling (Marlene D-Train)", "Ultra Violet (Singer)", "Tally Brown (Talk Show Hostess)", "Frank Cavestani (Doctor)", "Susanna Baumgard (Patient)", "Paul Fagan (Surfer)", "Jane Holzer ((as Baby Jane Holzer))", "Sam Shepard ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
