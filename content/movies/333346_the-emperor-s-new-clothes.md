Building on Brand\u2019s emergence as an activist following his 2014 book Revolution, where he railed against \u201ccorporate tyranny, ecological irresponsibility, and economic inequality,\u201d The Emperor\u2019s New Clothes pairs archival footage with comedic send-ups conducted in the financial centers of London and New York. Brand spotlights not only how the crisis affected the working class around the world, but also how the uber-wealthy benefited from the downturn. With Winterbottom providing his signature ingenuity and pinpoint directorial control, they generate a riveting, boisterous, and, at times, cathartic riff on the extreme disparities between the haves and have nots in contemporary society.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1cTKwKCiIzkXtz5PI5D68AFJy96.jpg", "actors": ["Russell Brand ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [381043, 336992, 348069, 396126], "youtube_key": "U4Geq8dM13k"}
