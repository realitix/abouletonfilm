This authorized film includes appearances from Chrissie Hynde, Mick Jones (The Clash), Lemmy and members of Pink Floyd, Black Flag, GNR, the Sex Pistols, Blondie, Buzzcocks, and more. Shot around the globe over three years, the film charts the band's complex history and infighting, as it celebrated its 35th anniversary and found its estranged former members striking out on their own anniversary tour, while still others battle cancer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xfXm5dfqnC1n3cGJb4c7m8eXuAS.jpg", "actors": ["Dave Vanian (Himself)", "Captain Sensible (Himself)", "Rat Scabies (Himself)", "Fred Armisen (Himself)", "Jello Biafra (Himself)", "Lemmy (Himself)", "Chrissie Hynde (Herself)", "Dexter Holland (Himself)", "Duff McKagan (Himself)", "Don Letts (Himself)", "Keith Morris (Himself)", "Mick Jones (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "GVI8SOt3OvI"}
