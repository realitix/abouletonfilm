It has excellent writing, direction and a professional quality about it you might not normally expect--plus the film is cute as can be with a really clever story. However, given that I have seen another of Adam Bertocci's excellent short films, LOVE: THE MOVIE, I actually was expecting something special--as LOVE was a heck of a fresh and entertaining film as well. Both films, it turns out, have already received awards and I certainly am not surprised. In fact, I can't wait until Bertocci \"turns pro\" so to speak--in other words, moves to Hollywood and makes a bazillion bucks making more nice little films--but with bigger budgets. Keep an eye out for this guy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yeXludZDAqYUWDi1mISmX959Wsn.jpg", "actors": ["Morgan Beck (Patrick Levin)", "Emily Mark (Katrina Fells)", "Ganon (Princess)", "Anna Ingenthron (Robin Aderyn)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
