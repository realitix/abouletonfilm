Set in Dutch Colonial Africa, the story focuses on John Van Laer (Fritz Van Dongen), the overseer of a vast rubber plantation. Van Laer's new wife Renee (Enny Meunier) joins him at the plantation, but the monotony of her existence, coupled with the unbearable heat, soon drives her to distraction. One of Van Laer's workmen takes advantage of the boss' absence to seduce Renee, resulting in her breakup with her husband. It takes an unexpected tragedy to bring the couple back together, though not necessarily happily ever after. Rubber works overtime to contrast the creature-comfort advantages of the rubber industry with the harsh realities of plantation life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kUv2lPWuGTYqtFXRq7V3Rl82wR9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
