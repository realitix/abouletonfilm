When an attractive young woman with a correspondingly jealous husband (Thilakan) moves into the neighboring house, tensions rise. The respective children of the two bickering couples (Rehman and Sisily) start a little romance of their own, which complicates matters further since one family is Hindu, the other Christian, and both sets of parents are opposed to the alliance.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Mammootty (Dr. Isaac)", "Srividhya (Issac's wife)", "Rahman ()", "Sisily ()", "Thilakan ()", "Sulakshana ()", "Mohanlal (Pauly)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
