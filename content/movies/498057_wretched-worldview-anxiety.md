BUT IT SEEMS THAT 21ST CENTURY LIVING HAS BROUGHT ON ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES THAT COULD STRESS OUT EVEN THE MELLOWEST OF PEOPLE.  THE GOOD NEWS: Christians throughout the ages have struggled with stress, from Psalmists to Jeremiah to John Bunyan to Charles Spurgeon. You are not alone.  THE BETTER NEWS: There is a Biblical cure. Jesus is fully aware that we struggle with anxiety and He graciously preached a sermon just for the anxious Christian.  THE BEST NEWS: God will give you the power to overcome your anxiety. God has given us His Holy Spirit precisely for this struggle.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iWZxkroqPucjNYLWrGTrcvKfKpA.jpg", "actors": ["Todd Friel (Host)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
