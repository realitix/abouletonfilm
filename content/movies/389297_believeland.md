The Fumble. The Shot. The Decision. Jos\u00e9 Mesa. And so it goes for Cleveland sports fans. BELIEVELAND attempts to explain the masochistic devotion many Browns, Indians, and Cavs fans have when it comes to cheering for teams that continue to break our hearts.

And that\u2019s because one day\u2013one day\u2013we\u2019ll be able to say, \u201cI told you so\u201d to everyone who refuses to believe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kpBqxDWL1WD6mSnibAbwILKgiuU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
