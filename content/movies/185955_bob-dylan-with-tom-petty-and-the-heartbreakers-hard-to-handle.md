During his four decades career, he has been through many facets: from acustic to electric guitar; from politicized to religious lyrics; from minimalist to very higly sophisticated arrangements. And his characteristic voice-for some, hoarsed and full of style, for others a little out of tune- it still influencing many musicians. In this presentation in Australia in 1986, Dylan is accompanied by Tom Petty and the band The Heartbreakers, as well as a very fine selection of new compositions. To close the spectacle, Bob Dylan and Tom Petty perform a vocal duet in \"Knockin' on heaven's door\", one of the most famous songs of this compositor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p8Rg8JmrnXe3L4LM2pQIN31Ak4R.jpg", "actors": ["Bob Dylan ()", "Tom Petty ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
