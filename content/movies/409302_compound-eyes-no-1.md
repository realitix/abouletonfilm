In training his Super-8 camera on insects and other \"minor\" invertebrates, Clipson draws the eye into an unseen realm, one so delicate as to simultaneously tempt and refuse the touch. Following the surrealist desire to make the familiar strange and the strange familiar, Clipson relates this micro-landscape to the built environment. Electronic musical motifs supplied by frequent Clipson collaborator Jefre Cantu-Ledesma add another layer of inquiry, one tuned to the unspoken space between wonder and terror. This first entry in the series keys the viewer's vision to a single drop of dew on a blade of glass. Wisps of eyelashes, dandelions and insect limbs seem to brush against the lens in a trembling intimation of seeing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8KvUFjEyRuJRvRgA66yOE2iPSJ8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
