The standard initiation ordeals which new boys must endure at the hands of their seniors are intensified in his case because he has aroused the jealousy of Peter, the head chorister, by singing a solo which Peter had long sung himself. The fact is that Peter's voice is breaking, and with a broken voice often comes a broken heart. But, encouraged by the director and all the boys, Peter begins to develop in a new role as composer and conductor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6tAPJbOX00ZgTOLvSsOFFTAQaRT.jpg", "actors": ["Vincent Winter (Toni Fiala)", "Sean Scully (Peter Schaefer)", "Peter Weck (Max Heller)", "Hans Holt (Schuldirektor Eisinger)", "Bruni L\u00f6bel (Mutter Fiala)", "Fritz Eckhardt (Vater Fiala)", "Gunther Philipp (Radio Announcer)", "Walter Regelsberger ()", "Denis Gilmore (Friedel Schmidt)", "Hennie Scott (Ferdie)", "Hermann Furthmosek (Choirmaster)", "Hans Christian (Choirmaster)", "Walter Regelsberger (Choirmaster)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [400400, 231259, 51107, 290163], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
