The film describes an intersecting universe of entrenched power--in which the landowning class, colluding priests, corrupt government officials, violent police, and U.S. businessmen--conspiring to rape the land for their own profit and to suppress the local farmers. In contrast, the working peasants cherish the land as their own and struggle to break free from oppression to build homes and better lives for their families.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m2vwXVrKiXfZR8R5vePnj7Uv8tU.jpg", "actors": ["Jos\u00e9 Luis L\u00f3pez (Calixto)", "Sa\u00fal Toro ()", "Daniel Vasquez ()", "Marisela Bustillo ()", "Eduardo B\u00e4hr ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
