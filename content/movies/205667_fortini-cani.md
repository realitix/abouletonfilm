Fortini, an Italian Jew, reads excerpts from the book about his alienation from Judaism and from the social relations around him, the rise of Fascism in Italy, the anti-Arab attitude of European culture. The images, mostly a series of Italian landscape shots, provide a backdrop that highlights the meaning of the text. - Fabrizio Sabidussi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aposvFNfTzM0iXvIv58IwZQi8mC.jpg", "actors": ["Franco Fortini ()", "Luciana Nissim ()", "Adriano Apr\u00e0 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
