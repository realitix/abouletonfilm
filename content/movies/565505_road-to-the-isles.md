We travel the line in the cab of a Class 37/4 on a sunny summers morning. So join us in the cab of the Fort William sleeper as it tackles the steep gradients to County March and Corrour summits. We cross the wild desolation of Rannoch Moor, the famous Horseshoe Curve, and pass along the beautiful Loch Trieg. An informative history and archive film chart the history and features of the line to provide a superb record of this highland route.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t7oQxmQEk9om6Gvz07NUCpn0ZNv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
