It's the early 1960's, and while Americans and Russians are racing to be the first in outer space, the people who live in a small town can't contain their fascination with the exploration of the cosmos. School children draw pictures of the moon, a repairman thinks he's found evidence of alien life forms, weekend painters develop a new perspective on the sky, kids get into the game by cobbling together a homemade spaceship, and a teacher obsessed with auto racing thinks he knows the secret behind some strange terrestrial events.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/51pbm7xmkobg4vh1JyCrg4s0Viw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
