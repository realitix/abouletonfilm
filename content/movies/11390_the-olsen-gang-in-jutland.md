Ones again Egon Olsen has a plan when he gets out of Vridslose State Prison. He has found out that the Germans left a large sum of money (in American dollars and gold bars) in one of their commando bunkers, when they were defeated in 1945; the only problem it's in Jutland. Egon, Benny and Kjeld \"appropriate\" a car and drives to Jutland along with Kjelds wife and child Yvonne and Borge. They look forward to fooling the the people in Jutland, but of course, things don't go quite as planed. It ends with Benny, Kjeld, Borge and Yvonne sitting in the train back to Copenhagen, were they are overtaken by Egon in his car on the road next to the track. This is the last time the Olsen gang goes to Jutland.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1YYxpSSZtnj6MZ8qkBPRipn35Hi.jpg", "actors": ["Ove Sprog\u00f8e (Egon Olsen)", "Morten Grunwald (Benny Frandsen)", "Poul Bundgaard (Kjeld Jensen)", "Kirsten Walther (Yvonne Jensen)", "Jes Holts\u00f8 (B\u00f8rge Jensen)", "Helle Virkner (Karen)", "Willy Rathnov (Rico)", "Karl Stegger (Mads 'Fem\u00f8re' Madsen)", "Preben Kaas (Better\u00f8v)", "Peter Steen (L\u00f8jtnanten)", "Benny Hansen ()", "Ernst Meyer ()", "Gunnar Str\u00f8mvad ()", "Tina Reynold ()", "Bente Andersen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [15537, 15499, 12711, 12592], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
