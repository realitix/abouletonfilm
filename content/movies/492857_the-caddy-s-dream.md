Mr. Browntop and Miss Kelsomine go out to play golf. They engage Andrew McTavish, a lean Scotchman, as caddy. After teeing the ball, Browntop hoists it with a tremendous drive into the sky. They search and search, but still no ball. At length, wearied with the quest, they lie down in a haystack to sleep. They wake 20 years later, aged and forlorn, but still continuing the search for the ball.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Mary Pickford (Miss Kelsomine)", "Owen Moore (Mr. Browntop)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
