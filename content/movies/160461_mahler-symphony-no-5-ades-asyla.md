Ades's Asyla (the plural of \"Asylum,\" used in both its meanings, as a place of refuge and a scene of madness) is available only in the video format, which is sonically quite good and visually striking. It is energetic music, with a lot of percussion, including one piece that looks like a tomato juice can, and one movement that annotator Andrew Porter describes as \"a sort of Rite of Spring cum disco.\" A video interview of Rattle is a fine bonus. --Joe McLellan", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sHbnTgwOHZy4JiP8ZeMBhrGkdIG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
