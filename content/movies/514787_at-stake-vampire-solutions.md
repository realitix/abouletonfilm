Full disclosure, I've been a fan of the AS:VS series since I first saw the 1st film at a film fest in Chicago. Really blew me away with the story, the characters, and ESPECIALLY the ending, but don't worry, no spoilers here.\r\n\r\nI recently found them again on Amazon Prime along with the sequel film and thought I'd show my support for the films on here because not a lot of people know about them.\r\n\r\nFor me, the best way to describe the AS:VS films are a mix between the TV show Deadliest Catch and John Carpenter's Vampires. It's set in a world where there are vampires, but the vamps aren't super-powered, or taking over the world, their a menace. And instead of dealing with them yourself, you call a company like the AS:VS company.\r\n\r\nAnd the characters that work at the AS:VS company are what make the story great! They're not ex-Swat officer, Marines, or Green Berets, they're the bottom of the barrel and really the only people willing to deal with the vampires and the results are pure comedy gold!\r\n\r\nI could honestly go on about the films and the characters for a while, but you should check them out yourself. I highly recommend both of them, though I think I like the 1st one the best."}, {"pseudo": "DeniseW", "content": "**Good Indie Comedy**\r\n\r\nI may be a little biased as I'm a native Memphian which is where the film is set, but I really enjoyed this movie. The characters especially make the movie unique and really drew me in.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see what the filmmakers could do with a larger budget and more FX, but the story and character work is great as is the acting!"}], "recommandations_id": [514793]}
