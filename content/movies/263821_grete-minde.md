Born of a noble Lutheran father and his second wife, a Spanish Catholic, Grete is barely tolerated by her anti-Catholic older half-brother as long as her father is living; when her father dies, she flees to the home of an uncle with the help of a local boy who has grown accustomed to protecting her. Later, unwed and pregnant, she must flee again. She returns to her home town, but is tragically ill-received.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vqe7Ao53qdnIEb9kEVMOvW8BLPk.jpg", "actors": ["Katerina Jacob (Grete Minde)", "Siemen R\u00fchaak (Valtin Zernitz)", "Hannelore Elsner (Trude Minde)", "Tilo Pr\u00fcckner (Gerd Minde)", "Brigitte Grothum (Emerentz Zernitz)", "K\u00e4the Haack (Domina)", "Hilde Sessak (Regine)", "Horst Niendorf (Valtins Onkel)", "Alexander May (B\u00fcrgermeister)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
