The world they occupy is not a world of large events but the rituals of everyday life, traditions and interdependence. \u201cIn Spring One Plants Alone\u201d documents the minutiae of their very enclosed existence. Filmed over a period of one and a half years, it emerges as a rare, haunting and powerful portrayal of their life together. This is the story of their rituals and of their survival. The small and disconnected instances that we encounter form a lone vision of the rifts and the bond between an old woman and her disturbed son.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zHdGVQhoRk9yoBzP2fhN7tJmg7l.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
