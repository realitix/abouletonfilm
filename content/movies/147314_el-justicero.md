The pampered son of a general, El Justicero is a hipster playboy who fancies himself a James Bond/Jean Paul Sartre urban hero. \u201cArchetypical\u201d yet \u201cfull of contradictions,\u201d he sees that justice is achieved for the disadvantaged while taking advantage of certain bourgeois perks. His exploits are closely followed and eventually directed by his biographer who decides a film is not only more lucrative than a book, but it gives him the luxury of reviewing previous scenes. Unlike Bond, El Jus eventually experiences an awakening which threatens to compromise the entertainment value and glamour of his life story. - Harvard Film Archive", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/adqLPCWandQXNN0MSwybpkez0ut.jpg", "actors": ["Ardu\u00edno Colassanti ()", "Adriana Prieto ()", "M\u00e1rcia Rodrigues ()", "Z\u00f3zimo Bulbul ()", "Emmanuel Cavalcanti ()", "\u00c1lvaro Aguiar ()", "Jos\u00e9 Wilker ()", "Thelma Reston ()", "Ivan De Souza ()", "Hugo Bidet ()", "Jos\u00e9 Marinho ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
