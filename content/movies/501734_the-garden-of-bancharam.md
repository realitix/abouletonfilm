Chhakari's son Nakari tries a new stratagem: he promises Bancharam Rs 100 every month provided Bancharam bequeaths his garden to the landowner after his death. Bancharam agrees but amazingly becomes healthier with every passing day, repeatedly promising to die but failing to do so. Come the appointed day, Nakari arrives with the funeral band and finds Bancharam glowing with health. Nakari collapses on the prepared funeral bed and dies instead.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fhy1EIWo3IDnNOSEPx35W8BEFLZ.jpg", "actors": ["Manoj Mitra (Bancharam)", "Dipankar Dey (Chhakari)", "Nirmal Kumar (Lawyer)", "Rabi Ghosh (Doctor)", "Bhishma Guhathakurta ()", "Devika Mukherjee ()", "Madhabi Mukherjee (Chhakari's wife)", "Bhanu Bannerjee ()", "Shambhu Bhattacharya ()", "Premangshu Bose ()", "Debkumar Chakraborty ()", "Manab Chanda ()", "Biplab Chatterjee (Hontka/Kontka)", "Ramen Roy Chowdhuri ()", "Debatosh Ghosh ()", "Samir Kumar ()", "Sadhan Sengupta ()", "Shayamal Sengupta ()", "Donald F.
