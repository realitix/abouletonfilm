Her daughter, recently returned from an Eastern boarding school, could not assist her and, although the cowboys in her employ were faithful, the ranch needed an executive head. John Morgan, a neighboring ranchman, had long cast envious eyes upon the widow's increasing herd of cattle, and desired to marry the daughter in order to obtain possession of her ranch.
