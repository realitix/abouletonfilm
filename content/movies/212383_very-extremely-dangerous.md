After three jail sentences (under two different names), aged 70 and suffering from terminal cancer, he announced his return to music. We follow a gun-toting McGill and his fiance Joyce through four states as he steals whatever's not nailed down and charms his way into and out of trouble. But when you point a camera at a man who will do anything for notoriety, how responsible are you when he goes too far?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6fvxqiLHeePBXUdBlUEv4UlsHFB.jpg", "actors": ["Jerry McGill ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "XjnMxed4H2E"}
