The project confronted the fact that little documentation exists from this critical early period and one often has to rely upon testimony from witnesses or photographs that show only portions of any given performance.  The seven works were performed for seven hours each, over the course of seven consecutive days, November 9 \u201315, 2005 at the Guggenheim Museum, in New York City. Seven Easy Pieces examines the possibilities of representing and preserving an art form that is, by nature, ephemeral.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qfPqP2WXaEbgpH2ucW6XOkmQH6r.jpg", "actors": ["Marina Abramovi\u0107 (Herself)", "Olivera Katarina (Singer (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
