Okay, this short doesn't touch the original film that it's paying homage to and it certainly can't compete with the ultimate nazi/zombie film Shock Waves but on its own it isn't too bad. There's a couple nice, gory scenes including one where the boys take off the soldier's hat to reveal his brains. The film is quick and to the point, which is good. There's certainly nothing groundbreaking here but it does a good job for what it is.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mwIC9ZNWiRMPmFaVfNjjc76jCNy.jpg", "actors": ["Derek Meinecke (Herbert West)", "Conor Timmis (Lt.
