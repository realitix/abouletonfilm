Jones is cast as war hero Johnny Kovacs, who wearies of the adulation heaped upon him and takes refuge under an assumed name in a theatrical boarding house. Here he befriends orchestra leader Phil Spitalny and his all-girl aggregation, including the inimitable Evelyn and Her Magic Violin. When Army officials trace Johnny to the boarding house, his new friends assume that he's a deserter and try to convince him to return to duty.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jYledkHDQgujphuAuTkk6evp8bh.jpg", "actors": ["Allan Jones (Johnny Kovacs aka Johnny O'Rourke)", "Jane Frazee (Joyce Benton)", "Gloria Jean (Marilyn Benton)", "Donald O'Connor (Frankie Flanagan)", "Peggy Ryan (Dusty)", "Paul Everton (Speaker (uncredited))", "Grace Hayes (Orchestra Violinist)", "Richard Davies (Lt.
