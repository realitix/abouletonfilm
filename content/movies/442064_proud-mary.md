Henson smashed this roll! She plays a hit woman that has a bit of a guilty conscience for killing a boy's father.  She ends up taking the boy under her wing & giving him a better life. I wasn't sure what to think going into this movie, yet the storyline with the action made it enjoyable!"}, {"pseudo": "Gimly", "content": "Very different from advertised, _Proud Mary_ was not groundbreaking, but it appealed to me enough personally that I'd be interested in seeing Taraji P.

Would personally recommend you give it a go._"}], "recommandations_id": [442353, 497814, 528390, 479198]}
