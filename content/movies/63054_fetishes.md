Mistresses talk about their craft; a few clients, usually masked, are interviewed as well. Then, the camera watches sessions organized around fetishes: rubber, wrestling, corporal punishment, masochism, and infantilism. Mistress Raven, the owner of Pandora's Box, explains that pain need not be part of the subservient experience: it is, at its root, a transfer of power. After their session has ended, clients talk about how drained, relaxed, relieved, and at peace they are.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pKfcIHHZjNaglwX6fRWvn2rbXoO.jpg", "actors": ["Mistress Beatrice ()", "Nick Broomfield (Himself)", "Mistress Catherine ()", "Mistress Delilah ()", "Mistress Natasha ()", "Mistress Raven ()", "Elissa Wald ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [273610, 49673, 25629, 256601], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
