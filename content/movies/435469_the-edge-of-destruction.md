It gradually dawns on the travellers that what they have been experiencing is an attempt by the TARDIS itself to warn them of something. The Doctor finally realises the fast return switch he used when leaving Skaro has stuck, and the ship has been plunging back to the beginning of time and its own destruction.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/SVA5wuYeJanPsvK9IYt5ly94q5.jpg", "actors": ["William Hartnell (The Doctor)", "Carole Ann Ford (Susan Foreman)", "Jacqueline Hill (Barbara Wright)", "William Russell (Ian Chesterton)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
