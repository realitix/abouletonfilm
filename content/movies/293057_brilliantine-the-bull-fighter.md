Like Mud and Sand, starring Stan Laurel, the Banks parody was rushed into theaters in November 1922, while memory of the Valentino vehicle was fresh. The concept of Monty Banks impersonating the passionate matador must have been innately hilarious to audiences who had seen the original picture.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Monty Banks ()", "Eddie Barry ()", "Florence Gilbert ()", "Jerry O'Dell ()", "Bud Ross ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
