Along the way she meets young mothers who celebrate motherhood religiously, goes home with an abstinent existentialist for whom sex is \u201cjust another market\u201d, and waits for the end of capitalism in a drag bar. Her attempt to write a book doesn\u2019t make it beyond the first sentence of the second chapter, and she finds no space between art galleries, yoga studios and the beds of strangers. Instead of trying to fit in, she starts regarding her depression as a political issue.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3HjrEpaj6xMMcPBpwX8b6t4iX4j.jpg", "actors": ["Marie Rathscheck (Das melancholische M\u00e4dchen)", "Nicolais Borger (Existentialist)", "Yann Grouhel (Normalo)", "Nicolo Pasetti (Der Bruder)", "Pero Radicic (Barmann)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
