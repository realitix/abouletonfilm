Through their music, the rockers of Ulaanbaatar (UB) are articulating their own understanding of what it means to be an urban Mongolian in a quickly modernizing city. Ultimately, this is an optimistic tale that will lift the spirits of those who fear globalization means a homogenized world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6qXg2DYMFeoXtBt72ImKEaV8EK7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
