Friendships are born, affairs, even lasting relationships. The number of white and black babies of unknown fathers that are born in the next few months in Luxembourg remains unknown. This incredible and thorough documentary by Andy Bausch features comprehensive, amusing and often touching interviews with Luxembourgers, American veterans-some of whom never left Luxembourg-, the children of the GIs and legendary photographer Tony Vaccaro, famous for his pictures of the winter of 1944.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f6707jt0mEorq9NSwt2OgQcr6os.jpg", "actors": ["Andr\u00e9 Jung (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "t5s7SwkMRfY"}
