From a raw yolk on a steak tartare to the fermented black of a century egg, food and other banalities of daily life can evoke fear as long as there is an element of foreignness and unfamiliarity.  Much like the worlds of racism and divisive politics, the ASIAN GIRLS universe is a comfortable consumer society where fears are not driven by evil, rather, by ordinary things and people that are simply different, whether they be foreigners, working class, middle class, or a next-door neighbor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wVNmNmC8JETs5l87x6ZQjmKhYtT.jpg", "actors": ["Rainbow Chan (Chan)", "Stella Leung (Yamada)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
