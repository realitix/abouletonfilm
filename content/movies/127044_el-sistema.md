It was set up over thirty years ago by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Abreu, who was driven by the utopian vision of a better future. In the dangerous and poverty-stricken shanty towns of Caracas, Abreu lifts children out of poverty through music, changing both people and structures.  The film El Sistema shows how Abreus astonishing ideas have led the way out of the vicious circle of poverty - and how the power of music has been able to change the lives of hundreds of thousands of young people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wXl4JUhwjNnbKGrv15Ehgw8QfWj.jpg", "actors": ["Jos\u00e9 Antonio Abreu (Himself)", "Gustavo Dudamel (Himself)", "Frank Di Polo (Himself)", "Sergio Prado (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "276oR_tEmbs"}
