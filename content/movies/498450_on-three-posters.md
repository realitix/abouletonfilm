The performance centred on an unedited tape made by Jamal al-Sati, a fighter for Lebanon\u2019s National Resistance Front. This shows three \u2018takes\u2019 of his martyr testimony rather than the approved version that was aired on Lebanese television. The three \u2018takes\u2019 allowed Mrou\u00e9 and Khoury to question the status of suicide videos and martyr posters, and to examine the ideological circumstances surrounding their production and place within the visual culture and political history of Lebanon.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
