Poor farmers, they live tilling the soil. Pietro is a good worker and a strong man who, unlike his three brothers, is not at war because of a deformed knee. Lucia is a beautiful and reserved woman dedicated to her family. Their life is peaceful and good, in spite of the hard work. One day, while drawing water from the well, Pietro and Alice accidentally free something from Earth's womb. A strange and alien color flashes underwater, at the well's bottom, then disappears. From that moment on, inexplicable events start happening all around the farm, and by night the surrounding vegetation glitters with a sinister glow. The color soon takes hold of the whole farm, and dwelling inside Pietro and his family's minds, it brings them into its sick world of pain, blood and death.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AqkGTBnn1k1vhmAiwChNhlAd57Z.jpg", "actors": ["Debbie Rochon (Lucia)", "Michael Segal (Pietro)", "Marysia Kay (Alice)", "Alessandra Guerzoni (Teresa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [71027, 200745, 271492, 29430], "youtube_key": "pMfzqBLeQuM"}
