The animals include the most endangered African monkey, a lemur (Madagascar simian), a mouse-size and -resembling relative of the elephant, a Caribean island-adapted sloth, a shark which 'walks coral reefs on an arm', the largest mega-stick, a deep sea jellyfish without tentacles and a jungle gecko mutation happening in Malaysian state Perlis in order to flee serpent predation into caves. Plant species include a giant Venus-flytrap on Palawan (Philipines) and the largest ever orchid from Peru.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bZpxJLIv6zr3ZGCTYiBIsibEaKM.jpg", "actors": ["Chris Packham (Himself - Presentor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
