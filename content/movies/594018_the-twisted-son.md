Nathan and daughter Addie have slowly been putting their lives back together. Paige, however, remains consumed by grief and withdrawn, and is unable to work. In order to supplement Paige's lost income, the family decides to rent out their spare bedroom. Surprisingly, life starts to look up for Paige once their new tenant Brandon Wilson enters the picture. A student at the local university, Brandon eerily resembles everything that Zach stood for in the family and brings Paige out of her shell. At first, Nathan and Addie are thrilled to see Paige acting more like her old self, but they soon see a darker and more dangerous side of Brandon. Can a family in crisis hold themselves together in the face of an evil genius? Andrea Roth, Eric Osborne, Tygh Runyan, Katie Douglas, Kayla Henry star.
