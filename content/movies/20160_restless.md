Ari, a paramedic, is a chronic womanizer; he makes it a point of pride to never sleep with the same woman twice, and his nights are a long series of brazen one-night stands. But when Ari meets Tiina (Laura Malmivaara), something unexpected happens - he falls in love. For the first time, Ari finds himself pursuing a long-term relationship, and he makes a genuine effort to remain faithful to her. But old habits die hard; Tiina introduces Ari to her circle of friends and temptation arises as he encounters Hanna-Riikka, a theology student, and Ilona, who is soon to be married. Despite Ari's feelings for Tiina, he begins having affairs with both Hanna-Riikka and Ilona, leading to an unpleasant revelation on the day of Ilona's nuptials. ~ Mark Deming, Allrovi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2MQyo1msG02u7MPZe3IxvmPOkgZ.jpg", "actors": ["Mikko Nousiainen (Ari)", "Laura Malmivaara (Tiina)", "Petteri Summanen (Stig)", "Matleena Kuusniemi (Ilona)", "Valtteri Roiha (Riku)", "Irina Bj\u00f6rklund (Hanna-Riikka)", "Samuli Edelmann (Roope)", "Vilma Melasniemi (Piia)", "Eija Nousiainen (Arin \u00e4iti)", "Jaana J\u00e4rvinen (Helena)", "Pertti Sveholm (Pera)", "Niina Kurkinen (P\u00e4ivi)", "Kirsi Tarvainen (Tipi)", "Wanda Dubiel (Tupu)", "Jere Viitanen (Roopen ja Pian poika)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [53503, 189076, 55496, 53296], "youtube_key": "bFcfwMJnYdk"}
