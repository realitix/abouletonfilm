Drawing its title from the Pentagon's term for crash, Involuntary Conversion evokes the hollowness and free-floating anxiety that characterizes late 20th century culture. In a voice that could belong to a hypnotist or a government spokesman, a disembodied speaker recounts a string of events whose common thread is a sense of impending disaster. The mood is suspended somewhere between nightmare and deadpan and is propelled by a narrative as enigmatic as the language it exposes. The iconic shape of a fighter jet floating in a perfect sky has the creepy feel of a video game and the texture of television is used to make the images feel domestically ingrained.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rQSFsCfXp8lRluV0HTlmmL90BwM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
