The first fiction film by award-winning documentarist Jaro Vojtek is an omnibus film about complicated relationships between parents and their children in which characters are challenged with long-term separation or declining health. Four stories titled Son, Marathon, Canary and Father tell four different tales that form a single view on the troubled relationship between parents and children. Each story takes place in a different season and together they create a multi-layered mosaic of relations  reflecting hopes, disappointments and inevitable decisions. With a documentary filmmaker\u2019s precision, Vojtek observes the characters and their behaviour, presenting an authentic picture of damaged family relations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vJtO6xZO1aiTaJOXaJe6ERCEN44.jpg", "actors": ["J\u00e1nos Gosztonyi ()", "Vlado Zboro\u0148 ()", "Roman Bubla ()", "Martin Horv\u00e1th ()", "Richard Felix ()", "Arnold Nagy ()", "\u00c9va B\u00e1ndor ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
