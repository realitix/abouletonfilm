He does not enter the boxing ring any more, rather choosing a coaching job and wild high life, including continuous TV appearances, hanging out and love affairs. One morning his daughter and his wife Vika meet him at home. Vika does not see the Artyom she once fell in love with in him any longer... The externally happy life of Kolchin comes to an end when the boxer he trains is almost killed during a match with the famous Kuerte. Artyom suspects that he used some forbidden technique. To obtain the proof, he has to go to Hong Kong where his long-time friend Vagit Valiev waits for him: he knows something about Kuerte which is not known to anyone else. To win, Artyom will have to enter the ring again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lIOWiPoIWg27bXUlHJ79usoRvxc.jpg", "actors": ["Denis Nikiforov (\u0410\u0440\u0442\u0435\u043c \u041a\u043e\u043b\u0447\u0438\u043d)", "Elena Panova (Vika)", "Andrei Panin (\u0412\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0435\u0432)", "Batu Hasikov (Kuerte)", "Mikhail Gorevoy (Michael Buzz promoter Artiem)", "Dmitriy Shevchenko (Nechayev)", "Olga Dibtseva (Lera)", "Sergey Ryabykh (Oleg)", "Maria Kurkova (Julia, a girl boxer Oleg)", "Sofya Mitskevich (Polina)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [56525, 56372, 43430, 53234], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
