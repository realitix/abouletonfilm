Hijikata Toshizo is a samurai eager to test his skills and sword and make his first kill. The dojo he belongs to practices the Tennen Rishin style and teaches this to farmers. Not considered real samurai by other dojo's, they receive a request for a duel by a rival dojo practicing the Kogen Itto style. Sohaku Rokusha, a teacher there, challenges them and fights with Hijikata Toshizo. The outcome of the fight creates a deadly animosity between them that lasts through the ages.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/itC9W1ggztfMZDlEDQ9C1z8fbKB.jpg", "actors": ["Asahi Kurizuka (Hijikata Toshizo)", "Shunya Wazaki (Sohaku Rokusha)", "Hidehiko Ishikura ()", "Tetsuko Kobayashi ()", "Keiji Takamiya ()", "Takaya Uesugi ()", "Shinji Takano ()", "Bin Amatsu ()", "Ry\u00f4hei Uchida ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "9yNXlZ-TRcY"}
