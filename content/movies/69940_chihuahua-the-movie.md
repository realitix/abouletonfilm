But everything changes when a special friend from Sondra's past transforms her into Bella -- her assistant's loveable little Chihuahua. While Sondra lives as Bella, her real body is in a coma. In order to gain access to the hospital, Sondra must prove that she has what it takes to be a therapy dog.
