The monarchs of Spain are not going to restore the rights and privileges which were taken away from Columbus after the first voyage. And Columbus will be shamed. Many of his sailors who have survived, can't face the journey home. They will choose to remain on Hispaniola or neighbouring Puerto Rico.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gbWPrVnAPbJZSP0mU7geW1nU0Qy.jpg", "actors": ["Olegar Fedoro (Christopher Columbus)", "Alvaro Martin (Ferdinand Columbus)", "David Sant (Bartolome Columbus)", "Javier Mazan (Francisco de Porras)", "Ivan de Lucas (Diego de Porras)", "Carlos J. de la Torre (Diego Mendez)", "Edward Herrmann (Narrator)", "Martin Dugard (Himself)", "Mark Horton (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
