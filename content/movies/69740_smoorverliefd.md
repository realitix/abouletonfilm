It focuses on the four women of the Miller family: teen daughter Eva, her mother Judith, aunt Barbara and older half-sister Michelle, as they work their way through the chaos called love. The result is a roller coaster ride of first crushes, lust, affairs, baby fever, and indestructible love. The four women are beautiful, courageous and sensible, but are also sometimes a bit lost. Can their male counterparts handle this dangerous cocktail of determination and female hormones?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1awP0XlDsBwvsdkqgtv8b6pPAdi.jpg", "actors": ["Veerle Dobbelaere (Judith)", "Wine Dierickx (Barbara)", "Marie Vinck (Michelle)", "Koen De Bouw (Bert)", "Kevin Janssens (Mathias)", "Koen De Graeve (Johan)", "Huub Stapel (Theo Cremer)", "Jan Decleir (Bob Seynens)", "Pierre Bokma (Gerd)", "Stef Aerts (Fre)", "Marc van Eeghem (Frank)", "Mathijs Scheepers (David)", "Karlijn Sileghem (Dokter Mermans)", "Luk De Konink (Karel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
