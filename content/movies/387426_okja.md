Before viewing Okja, I was a little concerned that it would be just a sappy feel good family film about a kid that developed too much of an attachment to a farm animal.\r\nNow, I'm simply amazed at how Bong manages to always give us such emotionally and politically complicated films.\r\n\r\nIf you understand his style and knack for subtle commentary, then you will see this as another excellent film in the same vein as The Host.\r\n\r\nThe obvious commentary is clear but not overwhelming and the subtle bits are in true Bong style.  I think many may misinterpret some of his choices, particularly with Gyllenhaal's character and performance, but if you grasp Bong's social and political stances then you'll appreciate the choices.\r\nFor anyone who is unaware, all of Bong's movies contain certain elements.  There are the overt elements that include humor (sometimes within the least humorous of situations), suspense, emotional connection, the folly of man and a lack of responsibility on the part of a government or corporation.  But these elements are supported by subtle inclusions which are dotted throughout his movies like little watermarks and always serve to say the things that should be said without saying them.\r\nBesides these factors, and for those less inclined towards analytical movie watching, there is always a great story and magnificent cinematography.\r\nOkja is no exception.\r\nThe only disappointing aspect of this movie is that it just came out, I've already watched it and now I'll have to wait another 2-3 years for another Bong movie to enjoy.\r\nI have seen The Host at least 10 times and I could watch it again right now.  I'm certain to see Okja at least two more times with those with whom I enjoy seeing his movies and I don't think it'll feel like a chore either.\r\nIn my opinion, Bong is one of the most consistent filmmakers to have ever made a movie and that streak remains unbroken with Okja."}], "recommandations_id": [290098, 376867, 393519, 347031], "youtube_key": "AjCebKn4iic"}
