Who is Dark Annisia, and how has this fearsome warrior accomplished what neither god nor demon has been able to do: force Sonja to her knees in surrender? An epic tale of blood, lust, and vengeance, \"Queen of Plagues\" takes Red Sonja from the depths of her own grave to the heights of battlefield glory.  From Gail Simone (\"Batgirl\", \"Birds of Prey\") and Walter Geovani (\"Vampirella\", \"Witchblade\"), \"Red Sonja: Queen of Plagues\" gives the iconic fantasy heroine a fresh new attitude! And now, you can see it all brought to life in this animated comic, starring Misty Lee (\"Ultimate Spider-Man\")!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rOwoxKn4aW5LDhfuI0TfpGpucbO.jpg", "actors": ["Misty Lee (Red Sonja (voice))", "Shannon Kingston (Ayla/Nias (Voice))", "Tyler Nicol (King Dimath/Toda/Thief 1/Zamora Soldier 1/Blue Spine Marauder/Purple Fishman/Hermit Fishman (voices))", "Becca Strom (Dark Annisia/Lila/Guard Girl/Seamstress/Female Soldier (voices))", "Scott McNeil (Tiath/Bazrat (voices))", "Mark Wheeler (Apos (voice))", "Dan Zachary (Ryshack/Archer/Grufo (voices))", "JJ Webb (Verdes/Boxer/Yellow Eyes/Thief 3 (voices))", "Sean Patrick O'Reilly (Tevius/Thief 2 (voices))", "Brendan Hansell (Trident/Zamora Soldier 2/Mob Member/Puffer/Trident/Piranha/Sharp Teeth (voices))", "Joshua Larsson (Puffer/Droop (voices))", "Kiefer O'Reilly (Arrick/Brother 2 (voices))", "Julie Shields (Female Patron (voice))", "Brian Ward (Sonja's Father/Peasant/Felth (voices))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Aec-pACyayk"}
