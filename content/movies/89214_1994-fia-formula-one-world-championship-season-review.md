This video captures the atmosphere well, with thoughtful photo tributes to both drivers and many interviews with drivers and team personnel. There are also excerpts from the key press conferences held by Max Mosely held after the accidents. The build up to the season is very good indeed, and there is a range of music used that bring events such as Jean Alesi's first pole position to life. The practice and qualifying sessions are well covered.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/muOBPGjMTaTttiDxl933YevDmd9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
