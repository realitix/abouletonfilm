Her beauty and charm causes the usual flock of suitors to chase after her (her \u201cbeauty and charm\u201d being mostly green and crisp, if you know what I mean).  And while no one should have to put up with the annoying pestering of suitors while taking a well-deserved break from trying on dresses and dining at the finest restaurants, Ms. Evelyne shows that concern so typical of the wealthy for their less fortunate subjects by using her money to have her newly paid lackeys make fools of her suitors.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
