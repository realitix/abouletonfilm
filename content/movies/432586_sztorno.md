Our middle-aged character's life is in a fragile balance at the start and soon that balance will, of course, be disturbed. Even without much in the way of drama at first, an at times nightmarish reality intermingles with nightmares, and, typically for a movie from this region, state bureaucracy and the absurdities of a semi-legal order play a role in moving developments along. So what is it that awaits our hero down the informal road he is officially sent? Complete deconstruction? Or the 'unbearable lightness of being'? If you give the movie the time to unfold, it will reward you revealing an entertaining concept by the end.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Andr\u00e1s Lovasi (Me)", "Ildik\u00f3 T\u00f3th (Wife)", "B\u00e9la Ficzere (Feri)", "Frigyes Holl\u00f3si (K\u00e1roly, the Principal)", "Annam\u00e1ria L\u00e1ng (Kati)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
