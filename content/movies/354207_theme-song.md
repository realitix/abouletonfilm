He is face to face with the viewer, his head close against the video screen, lying cozily on the floor. Acconci writes, \"The scene is a living room \u2014 quiet, private night \u2014 the scene for a come-on \u2014 I can bring my legs around, wrapping myself around the viewer \u2014 I'm playing songs on a tape recorder \u2014 I follow the songs up, I'm building a relationship, I'm carrying it through.\" Smoking cigarettes, he begins a seductive monologue as he plays \"theme songs\" by the Doors, Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Kris Kristofferson and others on a tape recorder. The songs are a starting point for his come-ons; the tenor of his monologues shifts with the lyrics. \"Of course I can't see your face. I have no idea what your face looks like. You could be anybody out there, but there's gotta be somebody watching me.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p0ND5FfNyh8RX6J083mcIuHx7rw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
