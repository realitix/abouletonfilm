Cameras rolled across the UK, France, Belgium, Switzerland, and Germany to capture the bands unique energetic performances and the highs and lows of trying to break into the music industry. Featuring tracks from their 1st Album \"Tales from the Doombox\" along with never before heard ones such as \"On My Video.\" Most music documentaries are produced once a band has made it, very few capture the journey.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5Ppxk8vtwInRp5SxxUwg9qNPvGT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "kkOWOOPqaL0"}
