Its premise is filled with the promise of a madcap film that could also serve as a commentary on the industry's follies. But what we get is an amateurish comedy that is only infrequently funny and often exasperating. Only last week, we had VTV Ganesh who was made the central figure in a film (Inga Enna Solludhu) and ended up as an excruciating presence. Now, we have Thambi Ramaiah, who is turned into this film's lead, and ends up overdoing his role. He plays Ganesh, a late 40s/early 50s guy, who, after years, of trying to direct a film, finally finds a break. To develop his one-line plot, he assembles a team of hopeless youngsters (whom he meets at the police station on a drunken night), and each one comes up with \"scenarios\" (which plays out with imaginary characters) that will make even student filmmakers cringe. Then, there are three of Ganesh's roommates who try to sabotage his directorial attempts by stealing this ridiculous script!"}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ySq9-ED_ltU"}
