The fish transform from pests to predators when human growth hormones are dumped into the local lake in the hopes of reviving the local fishing industry. Thriving on the hormones, the Snakehead fish grow to monstrous proportions, devouring everything within reach. Capable of moving and eating on land, they are forced to leave the now barren lake in a desperate search for food - animal, vegetable or human.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/H1xejuohFPx1VW5hlSPczwxp7e.jpg", "actors": ["Bruce Boxleitner (Sheriff Patrick James)", "Carol Alt (Lori Dale)", "Chelan Simmons (Amber James)", "Juliana Wimbles (Jagger)", "Ryan McDonell (Luke)", "Chad Krowchuk (Craig)", "Matthew MacCaull (James)", "William B.
