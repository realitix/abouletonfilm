But which one of these winners is the greatest climber of them all?  The documentary feature The King of Mont Ventoux puts five cycling heroes against each other in an unprecedented virtual race beyond the bounds of time: Belgian \u2018Cannibal\u2019 Eddy Merckx (1970), Frenchmen \u2018Jeff\u2019 Bernard (1987) and Richard \u2018the Lionheart\u2019 Virenque (2002), the Italian \u2018Pirate\u2019 Marco Pantani (2000) and Spanish climber \u2018Juanma\u2019 G\u00e1rate (2009). Starting together at the foot of the giant, they battle it out over the 21-km ascent along a winding forest road to the lunar-like summit of the \u2018Bald Mountain\u2019; a gruelling one-hour test of endurance and strength. The first to reach the summit is crowned King of Mont Ventoux.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7kKkmhND6gmQa1OB7kWy0Pym5iX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
