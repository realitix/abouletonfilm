The trial (conducted in rhyme) starts with a car that was in a hit-and-run accident, followed by a sports car whose sins are peeling rubber and general hot-rodding, followed by a heap, on trial for lack of safety. Next, a number of safety equipment designers testify that, despite their best efforts, the accident rate keeps rising. Through all this, the defense lawyer declines to ask questions. A highway designer bemoans the problems on his beautiful roads. At last, defense. He shows a number of scenarios, pointing out that the real problem isn't the car but the driver. Everyone left the courtroom, declaring the car not guilty, and drove politely again, for a little while.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bsvm24UD927eNqMU4ZOiFUxHs11.jpg", "actors": ["Hans Conried (Prosecutor)", "Thurl Ravenscroft (Cyrus P.
