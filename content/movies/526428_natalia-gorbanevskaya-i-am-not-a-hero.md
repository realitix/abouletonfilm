She was often called the heroine. She objected: \"I'm not a heroine, I'm just an ordinary person.\" The authors of the film shot Gorbanevskaya for several years, asking questions that worried her as a poet, forced them to go to the square, and how her fate developed after forced emigration from the USSR.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oDzeRHV3BoXpdjF7XjcyQJFuHyq.jpg", "actors": ["Natalya Gorbanevskaya (herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
