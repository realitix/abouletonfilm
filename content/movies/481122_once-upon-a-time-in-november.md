It\u2019s too cold for her to stay there. They set out to the city together with Kole\u015b, a stray dog. They had both lost their flat due to the brutal policy of the city authorities and now they keep going from one shelter to the next. Although the dog is a burden in these circumstances, Mamusia doesn\u2019t want to part with it. The woman makes herself comfortable in a squat where she and Mareczek witness the brutal attempt at burning down the building together with its inhabitants made by fascist militia who had left the Independence March on 11th November a moment earlier. The filmmakers used documentary material of true street incidents.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rEt7HKCZ83MmZyGaxy6Q12ZEeGY.jpg", "actors": ["Agata Kulesza (Mamusia)", "Grzegorz Palkowski (Mareczek)", "Jacek Borusinski (\"Klucznik\")", "Edward Hogg (Miki)", "Alina Szewczyk (Ola)", "Krzysztof \u0141awniczak (Ojciec Oli)", "Krzysztof Kiersznowski (Zdzis\u0142aw)", "Marek Probosz (Doktor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
