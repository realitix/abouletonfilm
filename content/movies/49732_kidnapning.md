A plot is cooked up to kidnap some rich kid. It works at first, but soon things get out of control.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xJOTRrt5B6JlH4ebG2V9rQTVqkc.jpg", "actors": ["Otto Brandenburg (Onkel Georg)", "Lisbet Dahl (Mother)", "Axel Str\u00f8bye (De Mille)", "Vibeke Hastrup (Nanny)", "Michael Nezer (Bertram)", "Jesper Lund ()", "Tobias Fog ()", "Henriette Holm ()", "Jesper Langberg ()", "Holger Vistisen ()", "Aksel Hendrichsen ()", "Kasper Vang ()", "David Cl\u00e9men Price ()", "Marie-Louise Coninck ()", "Torben Peter Hundahl ()", "Thecla Boesen ()", "Alf Lassen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
