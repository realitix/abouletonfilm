They had this yellow painted school-bus with a plate \"Further\" on its front and travelled the whole US spreading LSD and their concept of individualism, self-invention and freedom. The documentary shows a lot of the footage that was shot on 16mm during the travels with the bus, and a ton of interviews with friends and family of Ken Kesey.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9oX1qxt7VQqdBgFT1vzWAs24C6G.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
