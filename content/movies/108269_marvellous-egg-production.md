A juggler takes in succession about a dozen eggs out of his servant's mouth. He breaks all the eggs into a hat, and after having beaten them up after the manner of a cook, he extracts an egg as large as the hat itself. As soon as he sets this egg on the table there appears a tiny dancing girl, full of life, as big as a baby's doll, and who performs on the table some beautiful stage dances. All of a sudden she increases to the size of a ordinary woman, and jumping on the floor she delights the audience with her turns. The juggler and the dancing girl disappear in the most extraordinary way.\u201d (M\u00e9li\u00e8s Catalog)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/11JjNDZue6dteS3TIxMAc1QYwqj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [189806, 108297, 190704, 191625], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
