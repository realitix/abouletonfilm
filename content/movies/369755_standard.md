From San Mart\u00edn to Per\u00f3n on his pinto horse. From the Biiliken stamps of our childhood to Libertad Leblanc\u2019s tits of our teenage years. All clich\u00e9s of Argentine-ness gathered under one roof. But the construction delays. Workers entertain themselves with their own masturbatory drives. Or is it that Argentina is an impossibie construction? Always about to begin. always displaying great projects, great plans that never come to fruition. A second-rate country that hides its fundamental vacuity behind monuments. in Acha\u2019s cinema, second-rateness is exposed, shown in all its lying pomposity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8ZtdRcnxJ0L1sA4dBPZUWhcEShL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
