The 65 fire stations situated in the Bronx receive fire calls about 160,000 times a year, that is to say 200 times a day. Some are false alarms, but many are very dangerous situations.The fires are caused by different reasons, but most of the fires are cases of arson. A special fire brigade including sheriffs has been created to combat this. We follow police inspector Haynes who investigates the motives for the fires which caused the death of 9 firemen who died this year in arson blazes. This film spends 14 harrowing days with the firemen of the Bronx as they fight fires and perform a last-minute rescue of a baby who fainted in the smoke.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
