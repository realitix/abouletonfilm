In scale, in variety, in sheer inventiveness, Coney Island was unlike anything anyone had ever seen, and sooner or later everyone came to see it. \"Coney,\" one man said in 1904, \"is the most bewilderingly up-to-date place of amusement in the world.\" Coney Island is a lively and absorbing portrait of the extraordinary amusement empire that astonished, delighted and shocked the nation -- and took Americans from the Victorian age into the modern world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/82XGDcPHyHivQKT5HvqGH0UyBWM.jpg", "actors": ["Philip Bosco (Narrator)", "Al Lewis (Commentator)", "Vincent Gardenia (Commentator)", "Eli Wallach (Commentator)", "Elliot Willensky (Commentator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
