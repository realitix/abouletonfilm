BLAME IT ON THE FISH documents the tour in typical Primus (i.e. weird) fashion with an appropriately bizarre collection of live-performance clips, interviews, and behind-the-scenes footage, as well as bonus material that includes a \"futuristic\" mockumentary that reimagines the band 60 years into the future.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/98Q0BqFAW1aAymvQwKvoQ2cY9iw.jpg", "actors": ["Les Claypool (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
