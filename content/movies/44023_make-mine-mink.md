Bored with their humdrum lives four London flatmates decided that they should turn modern day Robin Hoods when they get a buzz from returning a fur coat to a neighbour before their housekeeper can be implicated. With great performances from Terry Thomas, Hattie Jacques, Athene Seyler, Elspeth Duxbury and Billie Whitelaw this comedy farce from 1960 may have aged but is still a lot of fun!"}], "recommandations_id": [49843, 191263, 456249, 46039]}
