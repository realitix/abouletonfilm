Kilbourne conducts a lecture within the film, displaying still images of women, men, children, and violent crime via a slide projector. By emphasizing the dehumanization of women by television's body-image obsession, she teaches viewers how America is taught to categorize women primarily as sex objects.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hSxEr5Zbb6m59R3chJw9rMcL4Qw.jpg", "actors": ["Jean Kilbourne (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
