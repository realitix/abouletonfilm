Chagawa dreams of publishing a successful novel and settling down with Hiroi and Junnosuke, but his day job running the candy store keeps him busy, and Hiroi mistakes his tight schedule for a lack of interest in her. Hiroi has also embarked on a secret career as a burlesque dancer, which isn't doing much to improve her opinion of men. At the Suzuki household, seven-year-old Ippei isn't happy to be sharing the house with a guest, his distant cousin Mika who is the same age but far more demanding. Mutsuko, the apprentice female auto mechanic, is still staying with the Suzukis, and she's becomes the object of the affections of Takeo, a downbeat young man who is studying cooking.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mBlW4x5UYgsBVCXCh3UXsRihKzn.jpg", "actors": ["Hidetaka Yoshioka (Ryunosuke Chagawa)", "Shinichi Tsutsumi (Norifumi Suzuki)", "Maki Horikita (Mutsuko Hoshino)", "Kazuki Koshimizu (Ippei Suzuki)", "Koyuki (Hiromi Ishizaki)", "Tomokazu Miura (Dr. Takuma)", "Hiroko Yakushimaru (Tomoe Suzuki)", "Kenta Suga (Junnosuke Furuyuki)", "Masako Motai (Kin Ohta)", "Fumiyo Kohinata (Yasunari Kawabuchi)", "Takaya Kamikawa ()", "Shigemitsu Ogi ()", "Kazue Fukiishi (Yamamura the teacher)", "Shihori Kanjiya ()", "Ikkei Watanabe ()", "Magi ()", "Seiji Fukushi ()", "Kazuyuki Asano ()", "Satomi Tezuka ()", "Toru Nomaguchi ()", "Kisuke Iida ()", "Arata Saeki ()", "Hijiri Sakurai ()", "Hiroshi Kanbe (Telegraph clerk)", "Shizuka Fujimoto (Dancer Chiemi)", "Shinichi Hatori (Newspaper reporter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [121239, 13430], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
