The first part of the documentary deals with the fruition of the idea and the making of the movie. It includes interviews with almost all the main participants of the feature, with the exception of actor Tom Cruise, who was a no show. The second half is much more fascinating and deals with what went wrong with the movie, and it's marketing failures.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Ridley Scott (Himself)", "Tim Curry (Himself)", "Mia Sara (Herself)", "Robert Picardo (Himself)", "Alice Playten (Herself)", "Arnon Milchan (Himself)", "Rob Bottin (Himself)", "Billy Barty (Himself)", "Ann Mollo (Herself)", "Peter Robb-King (Himself)", "Terry Rawlings (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
