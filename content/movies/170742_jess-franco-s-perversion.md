In the meantime, he delivers \"Jess Franco's Perversion\", the DVD release title of his 2005 film, which is again based on a story by the Marquis de Sade, who has inspired many, many Franco films in the last thirty years. In \"Perversion\", the great Lina Romay heads a cult of sadistic lesbian prostitutes who live for the destruction of men and any woman who dares fall \"victim\" to a man.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dDyIjNCpe0gL4hpE1MXu6lukFmB.jpg", "actors": ["Fata Morgana ()", "Carmen Montes ()", "Exequiel Caldas ()", "Rachel Sheppard (Mme Villeblanche's assistant)", "Martin Gardfield ()", "Domiziano Arcangeli ()", "Lina Romay (Mme Villeblanche)", "Eva Neumann ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
