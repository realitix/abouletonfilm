Carl Panzram was a lifelong prisoner and a hate-filled serial killer. Brutalized in and out of various U.S. state prisons during 20th century America, Panzram unleashed a rampage of revenge that resulted in over 20 murders and countless acts of violent sodomy. A single act of kindness, by prison guard Henry Lesser, sparked a friendship that eventually influenced Panzram to write his autobiography. In 1930, Panzram was hanged for killing a laundry foreman at Leavenworth prison.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wDIE31N7uN2FuuviZDVVm6gGq1T.jpg", "actors": ["John DiMaggio (Carl Panzram)", "Brett Jetmund (Charlie Panzram)", "Tom Lodewyck (Adult Carl Panzram)", "David Salmonson (Young Carl Panzram)", "David Weiss (Henry Lesser)", "Scott Christianson (Himself)", "Joe Coleman (Himself)", "Mark Gado (Himself)", "G.
