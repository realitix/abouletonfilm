To cash in on his rise to stardom, it was re-edited to feature more of him. Various shots were repeated several times; long shots were blown up into close-ups and inter-cut with other footage; some scenes were projected on a loop, so that Rudolph Valentino repeated the same motions several times over; one scene was used as a flashback; and out-takes from the original were inserted into the new film. In addition, the locale of the new picture was switched from World War 1 Germany to a desert island by the simple expedient of inserting shots of bathing beauties on a palm-fringed beach throughout the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e1HbSLNXgYegqySf5A6fRjdNUFd.jpg", "actors": ["Julian Eltinge (Clifford Townsend)", "Frederick Ko Vert (Lyn Brook)", "William Clifford (Dick Sayre)", "Leo White (Prince Halbere)", "Virginia Rappe (Vanette)", "Rudolph Valentino (Jacques Rudanyi)", "Stanton Heck (Grand Duke Nebo)", "Charles Millsfield (Pom Pom)", "Alma Francis (Eunice)", "Lydia Knott (Clifford Townsend's mother)", "Lydia Knott ()", "Fontaine La Rue ()", "Frank Gastrock ()", "William Pearson ()", "Frederick Heck ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
