In viewing the process of montage we can be seen to occupy multiple spaces through the same screen, fragmented. Similarly, the continuous physical timeline of a twenty-first century individual can be seen as fragmented across multiple forms of information. Where is this information... and who, or what, is processing it?  Darren Banks (UK) incorporates found and made film footage into sculpture and installation to explore ideas about domesticity, defunct technologies, cinema and the unknown. His work questions the perception of sculpture in relation to objects, film and memory.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
