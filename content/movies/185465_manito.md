While the drug dealers continue to disappear, their violent legacy still casts a shadow over the neighborhood and its residents. Junior, an ex-convict struggling to get his life back on track, is a product of this legacy. His younger brother Manny, the salutatorian of his high school class, embodies the hope of the future. On the night of his graduation party, Manny finds himself faced with an ill-fated decision that could change his life forever", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1Ok0JxRagLlN4X2Fg0UeiWjcJLQ.jpg", "actors": ["Franky G (Junior Moreno)", "Leo Minaya (Manny Moreno)", "Manuel Cabral (Oscar Moreno)", "Jessica Morales (Marisol)", "Julissa Lopez (Miriam Moreno)", "Hector Gonzalez (Abuelo)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "pancine", "content": "Meh, overkill on the stereotypes, machismo and ever present empowerment from saying \"fuck\". Predictable all the way through although Manny's situation at the end is easily the best part of this average movie, I give it an extra star for that. Overall weak FM release."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
