Knight Center in Miami, Florida. There were 2400 people in attendance and the show drew a 4.8 rating on TBS.  Throughout the show, wrestlers were being interviewed as they arrived to the building, most notably, Lex Luger who was attacked by the Four Horsemen and was busted open after being slammed head first into the trunk of his limo. This was a big deal at the time as it was the first time Luger had bled while in the NWA. This would also be an important factor in the conclusion of Luger's match against Ric Flair at the 1988 Great American Bash PPV.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4AGcmPuHQZsSvXEDQw44ZRvKcAu.jpg", "actors": ["Barry Clinton Windham (Himself)", "Martin Anthony Lunde (\"The Enforcer\" Arn Anderson)", "Virgil Riley Runnels, Jr. (\"The American Dream\" Dusty Rhodes)", "Robert Bradley James (Brad Armstrong)", "Thomas Couch (Tommy Rogers)", "James Hines (Bobby Fulton)", "James Williams (\"Gorgeous\" Jimmy Garvin)", "Kevin Sullivan (Himself)", "Steven Williams (\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams)", "Nelson Scott Simpson (Nikita Koloff)", "Roger Barnes (Ron Garvin)", "Robert Rechsteiner (Rick Steiner)", "Al Perez (Himself)", "Lawrence Whistler (Larry Zbyszko)", "Tully Arthur Blanchard (Himself)", "Steve Borden (Sting)", "Lawrence Michael Rotunda (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
