They rack their brains about where to find shelter and quite by chance they overhear a talk between father and son. The son is an adolescent who is head over heels in love with a girl several years his senior. He is living through the first drama of his life though his love is just puppy love. Then, being resourceful fellows, they think of a plan to pass one of them for the elder son of this family. The reason they give for his unexpected arrival is that he is a child of the father's long-forsaken love. They presume this cock-and-bull story will come off, and right they are!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yOagSK4AXOaUDaOXH6AngyIYPWk.jpg", "actors": ["Evgeni Leonov (Andrei Grigorievich Sarafanov)", "Natalya Yegorova (Nina Sarafanova)", "Nikolai Karachentsov (Vladimir Petrovich Busygin)", "Mikhail Boyarskiy (Semyon Paramonovich Sevastiyanov)", "Svetlana Kryuchkova (Natalya Makarskaya)", "Vladimir Izotov (Vasili Sarafanov)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [67786, 66091, 273961, 270393], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
