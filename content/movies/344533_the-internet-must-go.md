The film chronicles the journey of (fictional) misguided market researcher John Wooley (played by Second City alum Brian Shortall) as he attempts to sell ISPs' vision for what they call a \"faster, cleaner\" Internet. However, learning about net neutrality from several (non-fictional) people in the process, he ultimately opts to re-consider his standpoint.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mAb9t0rwRZKopfVYoajJSfayBIE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
