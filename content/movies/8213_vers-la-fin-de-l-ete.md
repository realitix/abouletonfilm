Hanna is looking forward to their time together \u2013 so when Thomas invites his older brother, Friedrich, who is deeply depressed over the failure of both his business and his marriage, to join them, she is disappointed by the intrusion. Easygoing, charming, and talkative, Thomas seeks to counterbalance the cloudier mood with an impetuous frenzy of activity, but Hanna retreats into sullenness and retaliates by bringing in her nubile young godchild Augustine until things smooth themselves out. Augustine\u2019s youthful sexiness has anything but a soothing impact on Thomas, however, whose adolescent impulses linger just below the surface.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bGS00j4ctC7i2GN2UpZYHBO6eqP.jpg", "actors": ["Marie B\u00e4umer (Hanna)", "Milan Peschel (Thomas)", "Anna Br\u00fcggemann (Augustine)", "Andr\u00e9 Hennicke (Friedrich)", "Gert Voss (Bo)", "Agnese Zeltina ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
