The documentary gives us an intimate glimpse into a world most of us luckily do not have to know. Although often as funny and surprising as a sitcom, it bluntly points to the hardships and desperation of the marginalized. As the pawnbroker states: \"You don't see it in your rarefied living conditions, you don't see how the poor people live, unless you come here. Tragic, some of it.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hKN3cRekPoSYupSMMmUuvBx7vPW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
