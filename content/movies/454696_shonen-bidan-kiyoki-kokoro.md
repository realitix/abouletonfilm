This film was included in the DVD release of 'Tasogare sakaba' and is one of the many 'kyouiku eiga' films that were made in the 20s . Uchida's first couple of projects were of this kind. The film is a weird mix of current and historical, with a time slip insert to an older historical period and scene. It's about discovering money that somebody has dropped and is a curious experience to watch.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yJuOqyZqPdEH9bRsQi9lNFqqI27.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
