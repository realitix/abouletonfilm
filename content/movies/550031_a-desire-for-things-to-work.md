As the city in the film is seen being empty, the flaneur \u2013 an unidentified traveller of the non-human nature, explores the city's architecture reminiscent of the pre-given desires and systems of attachment that embraces us all. Followed by the voices of the phone-sex operators, the trip is a dedication to the libidinal economy and the escaped fantasies that emerge.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
