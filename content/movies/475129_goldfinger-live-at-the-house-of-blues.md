Recorded using a full multi-camera crew and 24-track mobile studio, Goldfinger: Live at the House of Blues was directed by Joe Escalante and mixed by Goldfinger's John Feldmann to capture the band's red-hot sound with true accuracy. These two Punk veterans have teamed up to bring you a concert that is both visually and sonically stunning, while the hits keep coming. Combine this with some really sick stuff done with a twinkie and you have the crown jewel of Kung Fu's DVD series thus far. Enjoy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pmJMOyKkYvuCn4TFCieY4e5hC1C.jpg", "actors": ["John Feldmann (Himself)", "Brian Arthur (Himself)", "Darrin Pfeiffer (Himself)", "Kelly LeMieux (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
