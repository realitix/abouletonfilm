The rhythm and tension created by the interplay between sound and image, and their disjunction and conjunction, aspire to an organic and sensual moment where inside becomes outside, and outside inside.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dUnnKFLJTRSsA7l5hHM8Mq0wWah.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
