One of the biggest scandals of his administration was the termination of a graduation film production for acting students Gurvi\u1e43dar Singh had set out to direct, based on Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s above-mentioned story; the decision felt dubiously motivated, to say the least, as Singh was known to be a vociferous critic of Cauh\u0101n. Never one to give up, Singh looked at the materials shot so far \u2013 and found therein a moving gem of realist cinema that honours the feel and substance of lines such as: \"They swim to the depth of the sea, passing various levels in time.
