Painted Land weaves seamlessly the experiences of  Lawren Harris, J.E.H. MacDonald, A.Y. Jackson, Frank Johnston, Arthur Lismer, Franklin Carmichael and A.J. Casson \u2013 with the adventures of three modern day sleuths. Historian Michael Burtch, and the writer and photographer team of Gary and Joanie McGuffin are determined to track down the precise locations of these famous paintings. Archival film, letters, journals and photographs of the artists \u2013 some of which have never been seen in public \u2013 take the viewers back in time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gT5njVWur4RdpC6ygKmKg6l2Xz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
