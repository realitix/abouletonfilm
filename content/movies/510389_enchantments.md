Emma is now a pop culture loving, rom com obsessed, Zen seeking Wiccan lesbian living in New York City and working in a magic shop called Enchantments. In this re-telling of Jane Austen's classic we see bi-racial families and relationships and lgbtq relationships and realize that love is love. It doesn't matter how one loves, as long as it's true. It's a shiny, happy, campy love story like you've never seen before.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mcpIUD2VquZYIxBdvl9EPN28knY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
