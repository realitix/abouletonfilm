Chuck Wein is heard speaking but is just out of view. Sedgwick is wearing a lace bra and panties, and Piserchio, wearing only jockey shorts, engage in flirting and light kissing. Wein asks Sedgwick questions seemingly designed to harass and annoy her. Piserchio is more or less a bystander not interacting with Wein. The dialogue seems created adlib and no conclusions are reached in the film. The only conceivable climax is when Sedgwick finally becomes so mad, she throws a glass ashtray at Wein, breaking it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ghVMDCpL88cux6lg2g3u8gQS7eH.jpg", "actors": ["Edie Sedgwick (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
