Upon arriving in a small village, they find an abandoned city with houses, a church, and a fountain spouting clean water, like a miracle of a biblical desert. Tired of and battered by their life as wanderers, the artists decide to settle in the village and start a new community, assigning themselves different roles from those they have played throughout their lives. This new arrangement, however, will reveal these artists the worst vices of the civilian life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3gPQm6txMCHfa979jlV8fsYNKAh.jpg", "actors": ["Lima Duarte ()", "Cida Moreira ()", "Everaldo Pontes ()", "Magali Biff ()", "Marcio Rosario ()", "Fernando Teixeira ()", "Claudinho Castro ()", "Pietra Pan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
