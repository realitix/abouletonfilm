It's more to hear than to see. It shows only backgrounds from the real world with the heads of the charater-game-avatars; but it reveals some interesting real life informations about the characters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dXU1x0NDzVObmJcAqGkoBhbM1Bh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [{"pseudo": "shinigami3y3s", "content": "Offline meeting special tells the story of how the cast of .Hack/Twilight get to meet. This is actually a lot of fun and reveals what each character is like in real life. We already know about Shujo and Rena but there are surprises in store for Hotaru, Sanjuro, Mirielle and Ouka.\r\n\r\nThe art/sound is not great but character and story are good. It's quite enjoyable and anyone who has seen Twilight should watch this to finish off the series as it provides a good sense of completion and closure. The only thing that could have made this better is if they had showed the Real Life type animations of each character, instead of the game image"}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
