After a while it becomes clear that they are not alone as an unknown figure watches them. The first night they sit around the campfire and tell each other scary stories. One involves a strange video they saw on the internet, another involves possessed pumpkins and the final tells the tale of The Plague Doctor. Slowly over the next day each girl is killed, one by one, until only Amy survives. Drugged, she awakes in a strange room and suddenly the real terror can begin!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pvJeSejbRjDv6cZdeD5KxNotiDi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "SJ63lZolWSY"}
