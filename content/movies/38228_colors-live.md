The fantastic voyage that Between The Buried &amp; Me charted at the creation of their groundbreaking record Colors was both cathartic, magical and life-affirming for the band. Becoming one solid unit of artists and recording their definitive record in such a cohesive fashion is a very rare feat. Colors has since become one of the most celebrated records in the metal and rock spectrums for 2008.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ulUB7FJqA3rZo9rP91bnfE25zty.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
