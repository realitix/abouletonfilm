Time passes gently as the father remembers their past days together. As the boat makes its way along the river, the past, the present, and the future become a gentle stream of consciousness. Memories of childhood overlap with the bittersweet autumnal taste of a life that mirrors itself on the shiny and glittering water of a river on a lazy afternoon.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
