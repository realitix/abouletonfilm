This extraordinary work of art, in two different but interlocking and complementary formats, defies easy categorization. For in this multi-layered opus of poetic symbolism, photographer Bettina Rheims and writer Serge Bramly evoke the City of Light in a completely novel way: this is a Paris of surrealist visions, confused identities, artistic phantoms, unseen manipulation, obsession, fetish, and seething desire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/69xiafPwMbftknbo9OVrPFqsuNQ.jpg", "actors": ["Sabine Bail (The psychic)", "Monica Bellucci (L'esprit de gala)", "Sigrid Bouaziz (Sigrid Bouaziz)", "Louise Bourgoin (Louise Bourgoin)", "Virgile Bramly (Virgile Bramly)", "Naomi Campbell (Naomi Campbell)", "Eva Dolezalova (The Living Rose Tree)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
