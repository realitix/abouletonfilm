And as it unfolds, the documentary questions how society deals with men prepared to live and die by their own warrior code. Snatched from their cells in maximum security prisons across America, some 40 members of the infamous Aryan Brotherhood gang were flown to fortress jails in Los Angeles. Twenty three of them faced the death penalty at the biggest case in US criminal history. Marre's determination to infiltrate the Brotherhood and to document its history is commendable. And his persistence bears fruit as he achieves unique access to the gang's leadership, acquiring secret videos of prison killings, beatings, riots and drug running.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/snjQnzQvO5PzGmlmJeaSEOBNQJ8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
