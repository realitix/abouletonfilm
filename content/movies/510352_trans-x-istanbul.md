There has been an increase in the murder of Trans*. Crimes against Trans*Women are mostly not investigated. The perpetrators can usually rely on being exempted from prosecution. Ebru, a Trans*Woman from Istanbul, fights against the displacement and murder of her companions. She has experienced exclusion from state, society and family in her own life. For 25 years she has been active for LGBTQI rights. She wants to change Turkish society with humor, self-irony and political acumen. She meets Margarethe, a 85-year-old German retired nurse and mother of the film-maker, and establishes with her an old age home for Trans*. Urban transformation of Istanbul and the protests around the Gezi Park resonate throughout the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/viuBVBdPg1sup7P6wgCvGZlXoB4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
