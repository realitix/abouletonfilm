Cao is a photographer, married to an opera singer and with an infant son, caught in the usual professional morass of political compromise. His life starts to fall apart when he learns that his ex-wife also bore him a son some months after their divorce \u2013 and when the boy turns up looking for his father. Nothing wildly dramatic, just believable people in believable situations. If the ending seems a touch forced, this is nevertheless a sign that \u2018Fifth Generation\u2019 cinema is changing and coming to terms with up-to-date realities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2gJiUJfhhkRUbvTqpMjPABOpISs.jpg", "actors": ["Song Dandan ()", "Li Xuejian ()", "Jiang Wenli ()", "Ye Jing ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
