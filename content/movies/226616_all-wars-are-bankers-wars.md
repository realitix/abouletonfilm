Just one year after Mayer Amschel Rothschild had uttered his infamous \"Let me issue and control a nation's money and I care not who makes the laws\", the bankers succeeded in setting up a new Private Central Bank called the First Bank of the United States, largely through the efforts of the Rothschild's chief US supporter, Alexander Hamilton.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nwhXCkGzQp258h0s8njXoCzkdOD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
