Just as George Orwell had predicted, two men would meet \u2013 together, they would create a musical fusion that would change the world. Well, one particular world, anyway.  Told through the eyes of the people who witnessed it and with never-before-seen footage that has never been seen before, BACK ON BADSTREET is a documentary celebrating the 30th anniversary of the song, \u201cBadstreet USA,\u201d and the people that made it happen.  The documentary focuses primarily on the two songwriters, Michael Hayes, \u201cThe Singing Wrestler,\u201d and Jimmy Papa, \u201cThe Drumming Drummer.\u201d Together they wrote a song that introduced the world to a brand new genre in musical history. While not exactly Baroque or Jazz, this new genre was called Rock \u2018N\u2019 Wrestling!  It\u2019s a tale as old as time \u2014 if time only existed for the last 30 years. It is BACK ON BADSTREET!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jimmy Papa (Himself)", "Troy Randal Smith (Narrator)", "Michael Seitz (Himself (as Michael Hayes))", "Larry Velez (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
