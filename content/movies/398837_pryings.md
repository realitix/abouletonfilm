The camera focuses tightly on Kathy Dillon's face, as Acconci tries to pry open her closed eyes. Dillon resists, at times protecting her face or fighting to get away. Locked in a silent embrace, the couple's struggle is violent, passionate; Acconci's sadistic coercion is tinged with a sinister tenderness. The body is a vehicle for a literal enactment of the desire for and resistance against intimate contact.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9uu8MwCnoTiywH3BbzzxPgNSDMP.jpg", "actors": ["Vito Acconci ()", "Kathy Dillon ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
