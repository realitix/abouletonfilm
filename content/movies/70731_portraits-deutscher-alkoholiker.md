They are also alcoholics. In her documentary, Carolin Schmitz explores the protagonists\u2019 stories and their strategies for survival: the little tricks they employ in order to try and get through their daily lives \u2013 lives which become increasingly difficult to manage the stronger the addiction becomes.
