The negative was saved out of the wreck and presents a remarkable photographic illusion, inasmuch as one who looks at it gets the effect at the end of the picture, of a fire engine at full tilt dashing directly toward him.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
