Her work deals intensively with the tension between religion, sexuality and emancipation. Film documents and interviews serve to reconstruct the life of this independent and willful woman - from her childhood to her artistic breakthrough as a companion of the Lithuanian rock and punk scene, but also depicting her spiritual side, which brought her all the way to India, where she turned to Buddhism. She is shown as fighting for the Dalai Lama and a \"free Tibet\", shown as a literary mind, but first and foremost she is shown as a woman who stood bravely in the face of inconvenience, pain and inner demons.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bQOqWEHcEBFiJ1PsY4IamLuRW6Y.jpg", "actors": ["Birut\u0117 Mar ()", "Jurga Ivanauskait\u0117 ()", "Gediminas Storpir\u0161tis ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
