The administrators of the school greatly disapprove their students wish to build a dance group as a form of self-expression. But Robbie and Anna are not one of them; they believe that the youth must be able to exercise and improve their talents. So without the knowledge of the principal, Robbie and Anna conduct an underground training for their students such as Nico Torres, Anton Velasco, Liezl Hernandez, Agnes Pineda, Cathy Lopez among others. These students have different issues in life, but are binded by their passion to dance and groove on the floor. As Robbie and Anna helps their students reach their dreams, they would also get the chance to develop their and partnership friendship into something romantic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2DkncOUloTrTwuYz1igxY31kNrO.jpg", "actors": ["Gary Valenciano (Robbie Mallorca)", "Dayanara Torres (Anna Alvarado)", "Nida Blanca (Connie Tejeros)", "Jao Mapa (Nico Torres)", "Victor Neri (Anton Velasco)", "Roselle Nava (Liezl Hernandez)", "Jolina Magdangal (Agnes Pineda)", "Lindsay Custodio (Cathy Lopez)", "Robin Da Roza (Patrick Goitia)", "Cita Astals (Celine Goitia)", "Mandy Ochoa (Jacko Oledan)", "Bianca Lapus (Jessica Maranan)", "Mykel Gonzales (Lawrence Medina)", "Cholo Esca\u00f1o (Manny Pineda)", "Jay Tolentino (Jake Barrameda)", "Steven Alonzo (Eddie Boy Unson)", "Liza Arenas (Gina Reyes)", "Mart Mondale (Mon Sy)", "Subas Herrero (Fr. de los Reyes)", "Cherry Pie Picache (Ellen Protacio)", "Nanette Inventor (Virgie Zapanta)", "Tiya Pusit (Nena Masbate)", "Ogie Diaz (Oscar Cabalos)", "Madeleine Nicolas (Thelma Madrilejo)", "Ama Quiambao (Linda Paguio)", "Alma Lerma (Mariness Goitia)", "Christopher Roxas (Toffy Lozano)", "Mark Vernal (Carlo Meneses)", "Ardex Ramirez (Richard Suares)", "Gino Paul Guzman (Anna's Class)", "Joshua Zamora (The Manoeuvres)", "Mon Confiado (Ador)", "Maureen Mendoza (Student-Dancer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
