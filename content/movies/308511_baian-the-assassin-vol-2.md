A professional acupuncturist by day and an active assassin by night -- or whenever else he needs to be -- Baian alternately uses his needle to heal and to kill. It all adds up to a dangerous juxtaposition for the ruthless merchant princes and corrupt samurai lords who cross his path.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
