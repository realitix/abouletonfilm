An expos\u00e9 on white trash if you will.\r\n\r\nIn a lot of ways Scrapper has that same apocalyptic dread felt in Mad Max with the suspense and danger that went with The Hurt Locker. Within every frame is a desolate and gritty dirt-filled landscape, scattered with remnants of aluminum scrap. These visuals, combined with the sounds of slide guitar, harmonica, and Jew\u2019s harp conjured up that feeling of watching a dangerous and moody western where anything can happen.\r\n\r\nThe western esthetics become even more heightened when the portrayal of the scrappers as outlaw renegades come into play. These dangerous and territorial opportunistic crooks made watching this film a highly enjoyable one."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
