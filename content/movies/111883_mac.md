Their father was a builder and his sons continue in this family trade. At first, they work for Polowski, who does shoddy work and cheats on his jobs. When the brothers can no longer take being employed by such an angry vitriolic boss who takes no pride in his work, they set up their own company. Together, Vitelli Brothers Construction builds houses with pride and care. However, Mac turns out to be an overbearing workaholic, with obsessive concern about the quality of their work and incredible attention to detail. His intensity and driven ambition precludes a happy family life and eventually drives away his two happy-go-lucky brothers from his nascent construction empire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f8UsrhlRgwWkkqPNRjbtoDg4JsO.jpg", "actors": ["John Turturro (Niccolo \"Mac\" Vitelli)", "Michael Badalucco (Vico Vitelli)", "Carl Capotorto (Bruno Vitelli)", "Katherine Borowitz (Alice Stunder)", "Ellen Barkin (Oona Goldfarb)", "John Amos (Nat)", "Nicholas Turturro (Tony Gloves)", "Steven Randazzo (Gus)", "Matthew Sussman (Clarence)", "Dennis Farina (Mr. Stunder)", "Olek Krupa (Polowski)", "Judith Roberts (Woman on Bus)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [176081, 151307, 77333, 113936], "youtube_key": "fZK9AJkhMf0"}
