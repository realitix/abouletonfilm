The show is split into two distinct parts with the first half focusing on the \u201cDefamation Of Strickland Banks\u201d album and the second half on the \u201cIll Manors\u201d movie and album. Huge screens relay the visual elements of these musical stories whilst Plan B and the band deliver the songs from the stage. The connection between artist and audience is palpable with fans singing along to every word on the \u201cStrickland Banks\u201d songs and turning the O2 arena into a giant dancefloor during \u201cIll Manors\u201d. This is a breathtaking show that every Plan B fan will want to own.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w2xTRepOxcs0ejET4Oje8q6fmqK.jpg", "actors": ["Ben Drew (Plan B)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "E0ZUhD1b1LY"}
