Filmmakers Alan and Susan Raymond had remained friends with family members and knew the celebrity experience and the effects of divorce had changed them in many ways. The Raymonds filmed family members discussing their reactions to these events, intercutting the new footage with scenes from the 1973 PBS series. Although this HBO production was seen on HBO in 1983, it was not aired on PBS until 1991.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7zazW0n0XUzZ1xD3BoxHcelOE50.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
