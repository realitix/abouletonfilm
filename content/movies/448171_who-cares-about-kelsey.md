She attends a school with one of the highest dropout rates in New Hampshire and has dealt with homelessness, abuse, and ADHD. As a freshman, she didn't earn a single academic credit, but she did get suspended for dealing drugs. 'Who Cares About Kelsey?' is the story of Kelsey's transformation from a defiant and disruptive 'problem student' to a motivated and self-confident young woman. Along the way, critical figures in her personal and educational life shape her coming of age and play important roles in an education revolution that's about empowering--not overpowering--our most emotionally and behaviorally challenged youth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3yhNPZAT8ec4SGqJ0kgYTy5Fxjk.jpg", "actors": ["Kelsey Carroll (Herself)", "Chris Carroll (Kelsey's Dad)", "Susan Carroll (Kelsey's Mom)", "Kathy Francoeur (Crisis Intervention Coordinator)", "Sharon Lampros (Principal)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
