{"tmdb_id": 218330, "title": "Storm Over Bengal", "original_title": "Storm Over Bengal", "slug_title": "storm-over-bengal", "date": "1938-11-14", "genre": ["Aventure"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "This being a Republic picture, it should come as no surprise that Storm Over Bengal was filmed in its entirety in the San Fernando Valley. Within its concise 65 minutes, the film manages to accommodate a Bengal Lancers main plot, a romantic subplot, the obligatory coward who makes good, intrigue aplenty from a villainous Indian potentate, and an outsized climactic battle between the rebels and the British forces. Patric Knowles, previously one of the leads in the British-India epic Charge of the Light Brigade, heads the cast. Worth noting is the presence in the cast of Richard Cromwell as secondary romantic lead Neil Allison and Douglass Dumbrille as the despicable Khan. Three years earlier, Cromwell had been tortured by Dumbrille's minions in Lives of a Bengal Lancer, and he undergoes much the same treatment here-\"just to make him feel at home\" observed film historian Roger Dooley.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d8krzeTX9PhebYBBZ4kjP0HDc6J.jpg", "actors": ["Patric Knowles (Captain Jeffrey Allison)", "Richard Cromwell (Lt.
