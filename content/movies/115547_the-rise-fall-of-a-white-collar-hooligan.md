So, when I sat down to watch this film I wasn't expecting it to be my cup of tea, but I couldn't have been more wrong. WHITE COLLAR HOOLIGAN is a brilliant crime thriller that, I thought, was very well made. The directing and acting here are equally excellent and really keeps you hooked to the screen. All the characters are highly believeable and you'll no doubt find yourself empathising with them as things just keep getting worse and worse.\r\n\r\nI can recommened this movie not just to football fans - the film's obvious audience - but also those, like myself, who enjoy the rush of a great crime thriller. Lots of swearing, violence and drama. Great stuff!"}], "recommandations_id": [191646, 271188, 272636, 373321]}
