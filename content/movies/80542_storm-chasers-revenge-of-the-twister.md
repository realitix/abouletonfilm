Sent by her boss to Colorado to investigate the cause of a devastating tornado, she meets Will Stanton (Wolf Larson), Field Coordinator for FEMA. One night, while working closely together examining the wreckage of the recent storm, Jamie and Will experience a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon - a ball of lightning falling from the sky connecting with the ground all around them. As Will tries to shield Jamie from the lightning, the two embrace and find themselves in a passionate kiss. The next day Jamie and Will return to the location. What they discover is a facility where waste from scientific experimentation is affecting the atmosphere causing the tornadoes. Armed with the new information and seven new tornadoes on the horizon, Jamie and Will prepare the already tornado ravaged town for another possible disaster!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2DGyRweyG9qDQ7AID3SieDuWH7.jpg", "actors": ["Kelly McGillis (Jamie Marshall)", "Wolf Larson (Will Stanton)", "Liz Torres (Wallace Houston)", "Adrian Zmed (Smitty)", "James MacArthur (Frank Del Rio)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [16278], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
