The film features individuals whose lives are ultimately shaped by their obsession. It taps into why the subjects would risk everything just to spend their best time all dolled up. Some are loveable, others you may love to hate, but we delight in watching all the collectors and their passions come to life in this off-the-doll-centric universe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pha2Mw9FMza3xnKDW2bOBNimtO9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
