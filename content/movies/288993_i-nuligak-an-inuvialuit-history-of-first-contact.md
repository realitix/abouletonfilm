The island lays silently on the margins of geography, entrapped in the footnotes of history, a forgotten place frozen in time.  It was on Herschel Island that a young Inuvialuit boy, Nuligak (later named Bob Cockney by the missionaries) came of age-fascinated by Herschel, but equally repelled by the excess of so-called civilization. Through Nuligak\u2019s touching yet tragic life-story expressed through his writings and echoed by his grandchildren\u2019s poignant return to the Island-we are offered a unique view into an often troubling past and a potentially hopeful future.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ue2Iw6FaziMpNtEoxu6h8to13K2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
