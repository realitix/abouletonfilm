On checking out his decrepit estate the boys find one of their dad's ancient friends hiding in a closet with a bag full money. Whilst they decide what to do the pensioner is left to suffocate in the closet, leaving them with a much bigger problem to deal with; tell the police, or leave the body in his own home and pretend nothing happened (keeping the money in the process). This opens their world up to a series of bizarre incidents resulting in the village's quirky population gently decreasing during their short stay.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6I47BBWullupuiwjOjv4G2G9urY.jpg", "actors": ["Jeremy Drakes (Solicitor)", "Jonathan Hansler (Constable)", "Victoria Jeffrey (Betty the Barmaid)", "Mark Oosterveen (Marcus Drummond)", "Phillip James (Danny Drummond)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [57236, 118397, 138688, 59412], "youtube_key": "3RjQYTea1ko"}
