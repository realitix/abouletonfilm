With all new material, his new show, It's My Culture, takes you with him on his travels from New Zealand to Zambia, New York and London. South Africa's pre-eminent comic is to tour in his favourite place, home. It's My Culture shines Trevor in a global spotlight without ever forgetting the country where it all started.
