But I also never expected it to be an improvement on the first, and it was. I mean in the grand scheme of things that's not exactly an achievement, but it's pretty odd to think that a second film with the subtitle \"_The Second One_\" would actually elevate the franchise somewhat.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}], "recommandations_id": [331446, 205321, 390989, 438970]}
