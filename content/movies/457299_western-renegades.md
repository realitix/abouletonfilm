The dead man's grown children (Jane Adams and Riley Hill) want to investigate the killing, but the outlaw puts a stop to this by hiring a dance-hall dame (Constance Worth) to pose as the kids' long-lost mother. Johnny isn't fooled by this subterfuge, nor is his comic sidekick (Max Terhune). Once the plot has been established, Western Renegades adheres strictly to formula -- right down to Johnny Mack Brown's relinquishing the film's romantic-lead responsibilities to the younger, thinner Steve Clark.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tcy3XRJks1f5nD9x7zDAxDJ4Bnb.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Mack Brown (Johnny Mack Brown)", "Max Terhune (Sheriff Alibi)", "Jane Adams (Judy Gordon)", "Hugh Prosser (Jim Laren)", "Riley Hill (Joe Gordon)", "Marshall Reed (Frank)", "Constance Worth (Fake Ann Gordon)", "Steve Clark (Dusty Dekker)", "Terry Frost (Henchman Carl)", "William Ruhl (Bartender Curly (as Wm.
