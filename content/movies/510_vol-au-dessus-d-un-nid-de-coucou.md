Ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe Chief killed McMurphy as an act of _kindness_. Chief was releasing McMurphy - a once spirited man now reduced to a vegetable thanks to the control freak, _Nurse Wretched._\r\n\r\nThis classic movie still holds up after all these years and is a compelling story of blossoming friendships in a lunatic asylum.  Nicholson shines in his best performance and is ably supported by Christopher Lloyd, Brad Dourif and Danny DeVito."}], "recommandations_id": [103, 769, 629, 28], "youtube_key": "6aJT5fGCRPk"}
