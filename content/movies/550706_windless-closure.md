This time the videographic work takes primacy and is almost wholly abstract. The story-telling strand is presented (enclosed) as a self-contained element within the overall image although even here the unity of sound and picture is abandoned \u2013 none of the sound recorded matches with the image of the speaker telling the story of Nohi Abassi. The story penetrates and interrupts, and is interrupted by, the processed imagery and sound in narrative sequence, but its imagery is also made an element within the videographic episodes. It is accompanied by rainforest recordings, as a simulacrum, a stylised assemblage referring to the idea of an alternative/magic, ideology of existence and order. Sharp collisions of content. Everything is permeable, every image becomes information and processing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q5bdqK8uOEPE7CQ2AEZ502PRMyj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
