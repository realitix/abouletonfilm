Now, they've been rounded up by their mentor Jimmy Hook to snatch a priceless, some believe, magical treasure which transports them to another world. Neverland is a realm of white jungles and legendary mysteries of eternal youth, where unknown friends and enemies snatched from time welcome the new travelers with both excitement and trepidation. These groups include a band of 18th century pirates led by the power-mad Elizabeth Bonny, and the Native American Kaw tribe led by a Holy Man, which has protected the secret of the tree spirits from Bonny and her gang for ages, and that has meant war. But as the fight to save this strange and beautiful world becomes vital, Hook, Peter, and the ragamuffin lost boys consider that growing old somewhere in time could be less important than growing up, right here in their new home called Neverland.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xT3GvRSkJecQsZQXjhDhOgF1TtJ.jpg", "actors": ["Keira Knightley (Tinker Bell)", "Charlotte Atkinson (Tinker Bell)", "Anna Friel (Elizabeth Bonny)", "Charlie Rowe (Peter)", "Cas Anvar (Gentleman Starkey)", "Bob Hoskins (Mr. Smee)", "James Ainsworth (Tootles)", "Patrick Gibson (Curly)", "Rhys Ifans (Jimmy Hook)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
