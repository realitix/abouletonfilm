Live in Amsterdam", "slug_title": "ana-popovic-ana-live-in-amsterdam", "date": "2005-11-21", "genre": ["Musique"], "score": "4.0/10", "synopsis": "Recorded at an Amsterdam, Holland, show on January 30, 2005 (when Popovic was 28), this concert paints a consistently exciting picture of her talents as a live performer. Popovic is as captivating on the aggressive, confident strut of \"My Man\" and Howlin' Wolf's \"Sittin' on Top of the World\" as she is on the moody, dusky jazziness of \"Won't Let You Down\" and the instrumental \"Navajo Moon\" (which was written in memory of the late Stevie Ray Vaughan, one of her major influences). Although very blues-friendly, Ana! Live in Amsterdam isn't strictly a document of a blues show -- rather, it is a document of a show in which the blues meet rock, soul, funk, and jazz. Personnel: Dominique Vantomme (piano); Fabrice Ach (electric bass); Denis Palatin (drums). Audio Mixer: Ronald Trijber.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mymfzTMi6NDUdv2MPIhtQ3JLtWc.jpg", "actors": ["Ana Popovic (as Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
