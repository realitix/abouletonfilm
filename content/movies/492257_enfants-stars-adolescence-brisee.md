The older Corey Haim was not as good but ocassionally he'd get it right.\r\n\r\nBoth of the people playing Corey Feldman (young and old) however didn't come across as believable whatsoever as being the Feldster, which is weird since Feldman was actually involved and Haim actually dead of the making you'd imagine it would have been the other way around.\r\n\r\nNow the guy playing the old Feldman does resemble him physically a fair bit but that's where it stops.\r\n\r\nThe thing about Feldman (as well as Haim) like many famous people who grow up in the limelight is that he's a bit of a manchild because he was never really given a chance to grow up properly, and that doesn't come across at all in the older Feldman's performance (but then the youthful and wild side of young Feldman was not portrayed by the younger guy either).\r\n\r\nThe guy playing Michael Jackson in a couple scenes did fairly well, I expected them to hire Navi again since it wasn't long ago he filmed SEARCHING FOR NEVERLAND also for Lifetime Channel and did a pretty convincing job but like I said the new guy here did well too.\r\n\r\nAs far as the story goes it suffers from the typical things that Lifetime biopics suffer from, partly because they have to keep the schedule tight and the running time can never be more than 90 minutes so they are limited in more ways than just budget etc reasons.\r\n\r\nBut it was still fairly enjoyable and it was a surprising amount of hitsongs they used in the film one of which being CRY LITTLE SISTER from the Lost Boys.\r\n\r\n5.5/10"}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "X8lJJcedIiU"}
