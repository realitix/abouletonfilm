They hide out in the small redneck town of Backwash, where Catherine hatches a plan to turn the backwoods folk into an army of her vampire slaves. Cultures further clash when Ma Poissier wins a free room redecoration by fruity Frenchman Jean-Claude Les Eaux, who tries his best to fit in with crazy hillbillies like Lil' Junior and his buddy Cletus. Beer drinking, bean eating, tripe cooking, shower peeping, competitive farting, strip poker playing and all manner of insanity follow, all leading up to the town's annual Tripe Days Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/em0VEhI170eYoYWYluQqMUu9D.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
