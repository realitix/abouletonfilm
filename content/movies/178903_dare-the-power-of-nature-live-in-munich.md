Since their classic debut album \u201cOut Of The Silence\u201d (A&amp;M, 1988), a number of other studio albums followed, but fans from all over the world kept on asking for a live recording. On the occasion of the Munich Deep Impact open air festival of last year, the band\u2019s current label MTM Music thought the time was finally ripe for such a recording.\r The result is not only a CD but also a DVD, both called \u201cThe Power Of Nature\u201d. That very day in Munich the rain poured down, but the fans couldn\u2019t care less. Darren Wharton and his band members were on stage and the only thing that mattered was the intensity of the songs. No one better knows how to write a decent song than Darren and as to the audience: it was all meat and drink to them. As to the sound of this live album, I have to admit that I feared the worst, but rest assured: the sound/production is surprisingly good.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v25jbqRhRT3IWXgSnu6T8XtXsbu.jpg", "actors": ["Darren Wharton (Vocals)", "Gavin Mart (Drums)", "Andrew Moore (Guitar)", "Richie Dews (Guitar)", "Marc Roberts (Keyboards)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
