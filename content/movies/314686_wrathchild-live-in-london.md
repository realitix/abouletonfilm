Armed with memorably high hair and studded costumes, the band scored with such hits as \"Stakk Attakk,\" \"Shokker\" and \"Blood on the Blade.\" Their crude performing style is on hyperdrive for all to see when they rock London's Camden Palace Theatre in November 1984. Tracks include \"Too Wild to Tame,\" \"Trash Queen,\" \"Sweet Surrender,\" \"Law Abuzer\" and more.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tggOqL5lgcNoFESnnjtszpHlSPd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
