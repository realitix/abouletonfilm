Suddenly the photograph is \"released,\" electronically brought to life for one heightened, anecdotal moment \u2014 a single gesture, a punctuating sound \u2014 and then frozen again. Witty and often poignant, these revelatory documents of time, place and memory denote a fleeting, ephemeral reality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/th0BCICiJT9ch6PJFNvICE0Keli.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
