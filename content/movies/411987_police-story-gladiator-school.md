After busting a prostitute, she files a complaint against him. A week later he shoots her in an apparent frame-up job. Officer Stacy is prosecuted, found guilty of murder and sent to 'Gladiator School' (prison)! His partner (played by Benjamin Bratt) believes Stacy is innocent even though no evidence can be produced to say otherwise. Also working for Stacy's release are two internal investigation agents (one of them played by Ed O'Neill).
