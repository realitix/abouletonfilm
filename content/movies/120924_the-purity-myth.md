From dad-and-daughter \"purity balls,\" taxpayer-funded abstinence-only curricula, and political attacks on Planned Parenthood, to recent attempts by legislators to de-fund women's reproductive health care and narrow the legal definition of rape, Valenti identifies a single, unifying assumption: the myth that the worth of a woman depends on what she does -- or does not do -- sexually. In the end, Valenti argues that the health and well-being of women are too important to be left to ideologues bent on vilifying feminism and undermining women's autonomy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6no6v3UBFqUoEadmVUEHPkULbjE.jpg", "actors": ["Jessica Valenti ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "96n25hvuOTw"}
