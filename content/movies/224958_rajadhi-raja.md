Tragedy strike his life when his father loses his hand when a doctor in an inebriated condition operates on him. As expected his father is gagged by cops and lawyers. They assault him. In his death bed, his father gets a promise that he would make his three brothers into a cop, lawyer and doctor. Though Raja realises his mission, he falls for his own acts. The trio (who become doctor, policeman and a lawyer) gang up with a baddie Shyla (Mumtaj), a gangster, who rises to become a Minister. It is up to Raja to end their atrocities and teach them a lesson.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rnTKAwWaapBR0VFvvrqVRsAIrr4.jpg", "actors": ["Lawrence Raghavendra (Raja)", "Mumtaj ()", "Kamna Jethmalani ()", "Karunas (Krishnamoorthy)", "Snigdha Akolkar ()", "Meenakshi ()", "Neelima Rani ()", "Paravai Muniyamma ()", "Prem Sai ()", "Bose Venkat ()", "Yugendran ()", "Chetan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
