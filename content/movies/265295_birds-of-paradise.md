So when a coincidental accident involving colorful paint changes the way he looks, Jack is thrilled about his new appearance. But little does he know that his new look will soon lead him down a path of mistaken identity, adventure and danger. Aurora is a beautiful yellow canary that has been locked up her whole life. When she manages to escape from the mean network tycoon that has kept her caged up, she has trouble adjusting to this life of newfound freedom. When Jack and Aurora fortuitously meet, they will need to rely on each other, as well as their wacky friends (Larry the pigeon, Pete, the hummingbird and Claire, the bat) as their case of mistaken identity leads them on a thrilling adventure. And along the way, Aurora and Jack will learn that it's not who you are on the outside, but who you are on the inside that matters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dYLVoKJdOvsWXU0PT7elEtbyEv3.jpg", "actors": ["Drake Bell (Jack (voice))", "Gina Briganti (Secretary (voice))", "Keith David (Old Buzzard (voice))", "Ken Jeong (Vinnie (voice))", "Dallas Lovato (Valley Dove (voice))", "Jon Lovitz (Skeeter (voice))", "Jane Lynch (Rosie (voice))", "Ashley Tisdale (Aurora (voice))", "Genoveva Winsen (Feathers McCoy (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "5DKYdpdRIvw"}
