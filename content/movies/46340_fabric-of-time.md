But is all that changing? For the first time, science and religion have come together to uncover an age-old mystery: Who was Jesus Christ? What did he actually look like? And can the story of his death and resurrection now be proven as true? Is it possible that a single fiber from an ancient artifact might hold the answers? And has science found a way to unlock the hidden information contained in the artifact that could provide a link to the past-one that might explain the universe in a whole new light and give hope to people around the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tiqjq019C6q0qFJSPkYdAU5shDr.jpg", "actors": ["Edgar D.
