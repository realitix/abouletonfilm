While Miyuki visits her teacher Saeki to attend to a finger cut, she has visions of a somber-faced girl in an outdated school uniform. At that very moment, panicked students run into the office announcing that another student, Mizudani Sachie, has fainted while in the \"Hanako stall\" of the girl's bathroom, the rumored location of the haunting spirit of a young girl. When Sachie fails to regain consciousness, she is taken to the hospital, where she later awakens with no memory of the incident. Upon her return to school, however, Sachie now seems to have full insight into other things such as the manner of death or serious injury each student will face.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vx7BjVp4wsLjYfmz81u4KV7vA4e.jpg", "actors": ["Y\u00fbko Aoki ()", "Yuka Suzuki ()", "Masato Sasaki ()", "Yuri Iwata ()", "Sadayuki Murai ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
