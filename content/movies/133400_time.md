This film is no different. The plot is rather simple: a family goes to vacation with the usual stress. Then on the vacation the wife gets a strange kind of sickness and they go back to Budapest for a cure. While the wife is in the hospital, the husband visits his family. This is quite banal. However the scenario was written by Peter Esterhazy, one of the most influential contemporary writers in Hungary. His style uses a lot of surrealism but in a way that profoundly illuminates the reality. In this film, the reality is an atomized society where the so-called communist ideals are nowhere so everyday people are fully disoriented.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ef5piZ1sqXLPKey9bwQ1pHIi8Ed.jpg", "actors": ["Zala M\u00e1rk (Mih\u00e1ly Halasi)", "Kati L\u00e1z\u00e1r (Ilona, Halasi's wife)", "Gyula Bodrogi (P\u00e9ter J\u00f3, the warden)", "\u00c9va Ruttkai (Halasi's mother)", "Tam\u00e1s Cseh (Halasi's brother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
