Once billed as \"The Funniest Woman in the World,\" Mabley pushed the boundaries of comedy by tackling topics such as gender, sex, and racism and performed up until her death in 1975. The film includes vintage clips and recordings of Mabley, as well as recent interviews with some of the world's top comedians, including Eddie Murphy, Joan Rivers, Kathy Griffin, Robert Klein, Bill Cosby, and Goldberg - each of whom is a huge Mabley fan. A true passion project for first-time director Goldberg, the documentary shows Mabley's historical significance and profound influence as a performer vastly ahead of her time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7gw6iWMvdUZ8bWJVQFGFvqgLGwU.jpg", "actors": ["Whoopi Goldberg (Herself)", "Moms Mabley (Herself)", "Harry Belafonte (Himself)", "Joan Rivers (Herself)", "Sidney Poitier (Himself)", "Kathy Griffin (Herself)", "Bill Cosby (Himself)", "Eddie Murphy (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "u4maAWskn1A"}
