They waken him from a trance, give him a fee and he hypnotizes them. The stunts they do while under his influence would make the Sphinx laugh for joy. Hayseed stands on his head, balances himself on a chair and takes off his clothes. Mrs. Hayseed also begins to disrobe, but she goes behind a screen. Her bare arm appears over the top, and she drops her clothes on the floor. It is a hair raising moment to guess what she's going to do next. The mystical appearances and lightning changes are managed with wonderful cleverness.\u201d (Edison film catalog)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lZ70zUGlcVnfnCcrVpciF3wIjgO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
