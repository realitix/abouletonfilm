But not everybody knows them. Or has even met them.

Then we meet some absent fathers, explore the reasons why, and find an innovative way forward. It is directed by Ben Gregor, working with APCH in South Central LA, The Door in NYC, STAX Music Academy in Memphis and Homeboy Industries in LA, as well as young people formerly of Kids Company in London. Powerful, shocking and uplifting, with songs and music videos spanning the genres of Soul, Hip Hop, Gospel, Classical, Blues and Spoken Word, Fatherhood makes essential new voices heard.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7h5zGQzqAW9qNk9z6MsRPApVY2q.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
