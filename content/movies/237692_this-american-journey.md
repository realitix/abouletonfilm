Later they each fulfilled their dream to live here, but after two wars, a near economic collapse, and uncertainty about the country's direction, these two expats began to have doubts -- was America still the great place they once dreamed of? They drive across America to find out, interviewing random people about issues that affect and confront us all. From the ghetto to the gun show, the courthouse to the cattle yard, they are touched by the wisdom and insight of the people they meet. This American Journey is a cinematic postcard from the people to the people, teaching us that hearts can be healed at the most unexpected times and in the most unexpected places.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a0doNXGnUQB0GchUE0317nU0Tth.jpg", "actors": ["Mister Basquali (Himself)", "Paul Blackthorne (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
