It's winter, and the hustling crowds at best ignore her, and some are outright rude. She takes shelter and, to try to stave off the cold a bit, lights a match. It gets blown out; this happens again, then on the third try, she falls into a dream. In this dream, cherubs attend her, she gets a new doll, then a new dress. The cherubs put her on a throne. Then a storm comes, and she goes toward a candle. That candle goes out, and we see that back in the real world, so did her match and her life. An angel comes along and takes her soul.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/giIQtNpiLUto1GR6U4grjoRwWaF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [47448], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
