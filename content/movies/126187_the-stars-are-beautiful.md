Children hold chickens while an adult clips their wings; we see a forest; a narrator talks about stars and light and eternity. A dog joins the hens and the family, while the narrator explains the heavens. We see a bee up close. The narrator suggests metaphors for heavenly bodies. Scenes fade into a black screen or dim purple; close-ups of family life may be blurry. The words about the heavens, such as \"The stars are a flock of hummingbirds,\" contrast with images and sounds of real children.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iUyXNzihIgPjzZsR1vODFmJ1pQO.jpg", "actors": ["Jane Brakhage (Herself)", "Stan Brakhage (Narrator)", "Myrrena Brakhage (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [126213, 126202, 126215, 126218], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
