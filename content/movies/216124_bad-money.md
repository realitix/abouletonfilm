The film follows four characters - two leftover punks from the 80s, a typical gray-suited businessman and a vegetarian idealist - in their desperate struggle to hold onto their respective stations in life. These deftly interwoven stories form a cautionary tale of how people deal with the search for quick cash. In desperate times, even good people turn to bad money.
