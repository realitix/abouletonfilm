Almost 18, he\u2019s just finished school and it\u2019s time for him to move on from the sheltered security of his mother\u2019s home. Diagnosed with autism, he will have to learn even the most menial of tasks: shopping, clipping his nails, tying his own shoes. \u201cNo,\u201d says Alexander, when asked if he knows what autism means. \u201cDoes my mum also say that I\u2019m autistic? I can\u2019t figure out if I am autistic or not.\u201d Na\u00efvely trying to bond, as if Alexander\u2019s condition could magically disappear, his older brother Sebastian invites him on an exciting adventure: a five-day, boys-only trip to Barcelona, complete with a soccer game, men\u2019s-only magazines, a strip club and endless hours together on the road. But in this touching and often lighthearted portrait, good intentions are overcome by reality and excitement may soon turn to frustration.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/20Fj7zcwEHz3DS0k2XJsT4z6Gj6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
