Hidenori, a Japanese-Korean, hasn't seen his family in a few years. He doesn't want to go to school but just wander the streets. He always grins at a trifle. When he is caught stealing and he feels pain as his finger is cut off, he just smiles. He murmurs \"Should I commit suicide?\" in front of his dead sister. Yumi, an obsessive-compulsive girl, has a sticky finger. A boy who wanders the Sybuya. They join Hidenori's reckless plan by chance. They plan to stow away in order to show Korea to his sister, who has never seen the motherland. Three people who are out of this world and the dead go toward Hakata.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pJmZskcQ5nLUWmODKsEPpzuA5fj.jpg", "actors": ["Hayato Ichihara (Hidenori Kaneshiro)", "Mika Nakashima (Yumiko)", "Shin Yazawa (Nanako Kaneshiro)", "Hiroyuki Ikeuchi (Taro)", "Tasuku Emoto (Harada)", "Y\u016b Aoi (Harada's girlfriend)", "Yoshinori Okada (Sasaki)", "Jun Fubuki (Psychiartrist)", "Yoshihiko Hakamada (Record shop staff)", "Eriko Sat\u00f4 (Woman in a red skirt)", "Ai Maeda (University student)", "Masahiko Tsugawa (Man who sells accessories)", "Kimiko Yo (Hatsuko Kim)", "Akira Emoto (Shigeharu Kaneshiro)", "Masatoshi Nagase (Kazuo Hikita)", "Takashi Tsukamoto (Couple)", "Rie Tomosaka (Couple)", "Hideji \u00d4taki (Pawnbroker)", "Katsunori Takahashi (Big man)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
