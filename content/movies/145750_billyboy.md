{"tmdb_id": 145750, "title": "Billyboy", "original_title": "Billyboy", "slug_title": "billyboy", "date": "", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "I paid a whopping $63.00 bucks to buy this video. Did so because I lived in South Africa years ago and thought it'd be interesting to see this South African filmed movie. Also, I am a boxing fan and recall Duane Bobick. What a big disappointment; I'm talking major! Duane Bobick just can't act. The poor guy is stiff, machine-like, almost a walking-talking robot. You can see how his face was battered by over 40 professional fights. The rest of the cast is just as bad. The story-line is a bizarre mix of romance, incest, sadism, and boxing. If you blink your eyes you can see a host of well-known boxers from South Africa in uncredited roles. Billyboy is not worth a 3 dollar rental,let alone the money I paid for it. I gave my copy away to a friend, who in turn sold it at a garage sale for a buck!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
