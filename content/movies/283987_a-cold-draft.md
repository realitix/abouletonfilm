What is most provocative about this film is that it proposes multiple credible points of view even as the woman is being certified insane by the Censors. We voyage into the skull of a woman and peer out to a monumentally static cold waste with planetary slow motion. It is the bunker-eye view.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ngugaIOulqflvGkJttLKUfVBvkK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
