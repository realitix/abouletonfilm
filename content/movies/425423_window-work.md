Sometimes one hears the rhythmic, pulsing symphony of crickets in a Baltimore summer night. Other times jangling toys dissolve into the roar of a jet overhead, or children tremble at the sound of thunder. These disparate sounds dislocate the space temporally and physically from the restrictions of reality. The small home-movie boxes within the larger screen are gestural forms of memory, clues to childhood, mnemonic devices that expand on the sense of immediacy in her \u201cdrama.\u201d These miniature image-objects represent snippets of an even earlier media technology: film. In contrast to the real time video image, they feel fleeting, ephemeral, imprecise.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i65Jrp7npmP6FPi7tsC7oY2iOUd.jpg", "actors": ["Lynne Sachs ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
