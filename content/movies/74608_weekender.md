The rave scene has arrived from Ibiza and warehouse parties are exploding across the UK bringing phenomenal wealth to the organisers. In Manchester, best mates Matt and Dylan are in their early 20's and long to be more than just punters. As the government moves to outlaw the scene, it's now or never and they quickly rise through the ranks to join the promoting elite. They are taken on a wild journey from the exclusive VIP rooms of London clubs to the outrageous parties in Ibiza super-villas and the hedonism of Amsterdam. It's everything they dreamed of and more. But as their success continues to grow, they attract a more dark and sinister world. Matt and Dylan start to drift apart as they are forced to question the dreams they set out to achieve and their once solid friendship.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wNiEBKSrlGWmbp2dpKct3P3siaV.jpg", "actors": ["Jack O'Connell (Dylan)", "Henry Lloyd-Hughes (Matt)", "Emily Barclay (Claire)", "Ben Batt (John Anderson)", "Stephen Wight (Gary Mac)", "Zawe Ashton (Sarah)", "Tom Meeten (Captain Acid)", "Sam Hazeldine (Maurice)", "Richard Riddell (Craig)", "Dean Andrews (Sergeant Thompson)", "Iain McKee (Peanut)", "Perry Fitzpatrick (Chris)", "Chelsea Matthews (Briannna Murphy)", "Fergus O'Donnell (Tommy)", "Kyle Summercorn (Stuart)", "Ali Craig (Bigfoot)", "Mark Sheals (Nigel)", "Reuben Johnson (Wee Man)", "David Judge (Scally)", "Jamie Dorrington (Raver)", "Craig Izzard (Doorman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [111942, 112672, 54873, 63480], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
