When Paul goes back to the car for some cigarettes he's not given a chance to ponder the carcinogenic ramifications as an axe blade makes the point moot. Panic stricken, Helen runs into the woods, only to find Odie Pickett as her only savior. He takes her back to his place, where pregnant wife Emmy, thick-as-a-brick son Bo, and available-since-she-was-twelve daughter Sarah, do their best to give her a \"family\" welcome. While Helen's immediate danger is somewhat delayed, her newfound shelter begins showing some signs of danger as well.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8CvjmMlM0T3OVF5mpAEEWaevLg3.jpg", "actors": ["Gene Ross (Odis Pickett)", "Ann Stafford (Emmy Pickett)", "Norma Moore (Helen Fraser)", "Camilla Carr (Sarah Pickett)", "Charlie Dell (Bo Pickett)", "Hugh Feagin (Jim)", "Joel Colodner (Paul Fraser)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
