The dark-haired, slightly taller boxer throws a right and the light-haired smaller one goes down; but he's up before the referee starts counting. After the knockdown, the boxers mostly hit each other's gloves. The fans, at least one of whom is sitting inside the ring, show no animation. They're all men, dressed in a range of late 19th-century garb.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xfLRj4mDRVjWeQegWn8w00oyPJI.jpg", "actors": ["Eugene Hornbacker (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [159903, 105157, 159904, 159905], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
