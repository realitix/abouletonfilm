His flourishing business goes bankrupt when he gets hairdresser's eczema overnight. He loses his customers and his wife. What is more, he is in trouble with the law. At the police station, he encounters heavyweight Bobo who asks him for all his money. When Max refuses, Bobo gets the impression that he must be tough. In reality, he just wants to be left alone. In his good old days, Max never cared for anyone, so now there is no one he can turn to. Bobo, who spent all his life in foster homes and youth centers, seems to be the only one to care for him.

Bobo's idea is to rob a jewelry store.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mnV4iRgu3N90v0GidcU9ilV2IvW.jpg", "actors": ["Alfredo Pea (Max)", "Jan Hammenecker (Bobo)", "Jean-Marie Petiniot (L'inspecteur)", "Ludo Busschots (Bertrand)", "Nathalie Laroche (Gis\u00e8le)", "Bernard Sens (Pol)", "Reine-Isabelle L\u00e9on (Nadia)", "Amid Chakir (Jean-Pierre)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
