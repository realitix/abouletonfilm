After three months in custody, Koch, together with 12 other animal-rights activists, went on trial. They were charged with being members of a criminal organisation and therefore breaching article 273a of the Austrian Penal Code, introduced in the wake of 9/11. The article\u2019s intention is to allow the state to stifle terrorist activity. Years of observation, house searches, and undercover agents \u2013 the police left no stone unturned in its bid to prove the animal-rights activists\u2019 guilt. The sobering result: five million Euros worth of investigation, no proof and a great deal of scepticism towards the Austrian justice system \u2013 and democracy itself. Filmmaker Igor Hauzenberger captures one of the highest profile cases this alpine republic has ever seen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pxJpqKJSvhLHxMN2bCGNI6eqqYO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
