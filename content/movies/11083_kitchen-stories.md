Folke Nilsson (Tomas Norstr\u00f6m) is assigned to study the habits of Isak Bj\u00f8rvik (Joachim Calmeyer). By the rules of the research institute, Folke has to sit on an umpire's chair in Isak's kitchen and observe him from there, but never talk to him. Isak stops using his kitchen and observes Folke through a hole in the ceiling instead. However, the two lonely men slowly overcome the initial post-war Norwegian-Swede distrust and become friends.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kDpGQxRodd842Pc9VJFk0OiCzv3.jpg", "actors": ["Joachim Calmeyer (Isak Bj\u00f8rvik)", "Tomas Norstr\u00f6m (Folke Nilsson)", "Bj\u00f8rn Floberg (Grant)", "Reine Brynolfsson (Malmberg)", "Sverre Anker Ousdal (Dr. Jack Zac.
