When the king of the media and his politico-journalistic buffoons are sifted by a radical counter-audiovisual power, the discredit of the \"elites\" sanctioned by the referendum of May 29, 2005 is better understood. With this film, Zalea TV's team had decided to laugh about it and make them laugh, even if at bottom these discoveries were rather disturbing. By staging a series of very simple techniques of \"self-defense\", this film is an invitation to self-disengage permanently. The use of the TV-B Gone, an instrument whose sole function is to turn off the television, appears here as the ultimate resort to media criticism.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sFzVQ1POC53bN7ERev3XuRD4Dvu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Tg7CW3xA1XE"}
