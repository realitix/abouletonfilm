Referencing Warhol\u2019s screen tests, 1930s Hollywood glamour, and the disappearing cigarette break, the film captures 20 of Benning\u2019s friends (including filmmaker Sharon Lockhart, cultural theorist Dick Hebdige, and book editor Janet Jenkins) satiating their smoke cravings. Each shot\u2019s length is determined by the time it takes each subject to smoke a cigarette, and over the course of the film a dynamic range of personalities emerges out of an array of physical characteristics, distinctive settings, and personal relationships to the camera.
