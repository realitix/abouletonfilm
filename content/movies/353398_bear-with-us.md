Think \"Jaws\" but much funnier and with a bear instead of a shark. It's a total comedy of errors that takes a comical look at just how far we'll go to preserve our relationships.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6sNDW3JZ0ydNhd2U1FXFHMyUX6b.jpg", "actors": ["Lea DeLaria (Chief Ranger Stewart (voice))", "Christy Carlson Romano (Quincy Adams)", "Cheyenne Jackson (Hudson)", "Alex McKenna (Tammy)", "Alice Ripley (Melanie Carter)", "Curtiss Cook (Stanley Carter)", "Kevin Carolan (Ranger Rick)", "Mark O'Sullivan (Colin Dense)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "3VZmc5gasPU"}
