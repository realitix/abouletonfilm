A play takes place, where no text is written but where everyone knows his role on the fingertips. The actors, since distant times, have all the same suit: a black blouse and a cane. During this short lapse of time, they are going to confront themselves, to flee, to catch, to tap on the shoulder, to laugh and to have a row, to love and to hate themselves. These actors of a moment are the traders in cattle of the market of Laissac.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iiNe6bXh7lxMWHLp81EO5A2fXcR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
