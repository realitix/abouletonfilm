Now a historian says he has evidence that Mengele's attempts may not have ended in Auschwitz and that his obsession to engineer an Aryan master race continued in South America. Deep in the Brazilian outback, a tiny town exists with reportedly some 44 pairs of twins, many blonde and blue-eyed. Could they be the product of Mengele's machinations?  With exclusive access, National Geographic goes inside the investigation. From the secret agents who trailed him, to the scientists now uncovering the facts behind the fantastical phenomenon, no stone is left unturned.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vjtAB1hR6691ba1QFFlrQXIFLf2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
