He brings Lord Richard Percy, Anne's first love, back from exile so that he can find an excuse to accuse her of adultery. With the unwitting aid of Smeaton, a court musician, and Lord Rochefort, Anne's brother, the trap is easily sprung.  This 2011 live recording from the Wiener Staatsoper showcases Anna Netrebko as she \"scored a personal triumph\" in her debut as the hapless Tudor Queen, while her stage partners - notably El\u012bna Garan\u010da as Jane Seymour and Ildebrando D'Arcangelo as Henry VIII - were likewise showered with critical acclaim.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pymU8HpU7J18JQoPpzCBdTJ3eCM.jpg", "actors": ["Ildebrando d'Arcangelo (Enrico VIII)", "Anna Netrebko (Anna Bolena)", "El\u012bna Garan\u010da (Giovanna Seymour)", "Dan Paul Dumitrescu (Lord Rochefort)", "Francesco Meli (Lord Riccardo Percy)", "Elisabeth Kulman (Smeton)", "Peter Jelosits (Sir Hervey)", "Evelino Pid\u00f2 (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
