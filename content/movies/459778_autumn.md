Masao Muraoka hasn't released a novel since \"Aki no Riyuu.\" Masao has suffered from mental health issues and, because of this, his voice fails. The two men talk through written notes. It seems Mamoru believes in Masao\u2019s talent as a writer and waits for him to write a new novel, but he also likes Masao's wife Misaki (Shinobu Terajima).  One day, Miku (Shuri), who has read Masao\u2019s last novel \u201cAki no Riyuu\u201d several times, appears in front of him. She tells him that she is so similar to the heroine of the novel and can understand his mind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lpRduTPiCZ5bJ82l3QFSHLKbqzr.jpg", "actors": ["Ito Yozaburo ()", "Kazuhiro Sano ()", "Shinobu Terajima ()", "Shuri ()", "Hisayasu Sat\u00f4 ()", "Takahisa Zeze ()", "Shinji Imaoka ()", "Toshiki Sato ()", "Sawa Masaki ()", "Tomori Abe ()", "Bunyo Kimura ()", "Tomoko Ando ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
