In these wryly humorous narratives, Cynthia's interactions with her everyday world mix the mundane and the surreal. A portrait of anxiety set in a generic supermarket, Whispering Pines 1 foregrounds the artist's ongoing concerns with the ways in which people are at once estranged from and invested in consumer goods.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
