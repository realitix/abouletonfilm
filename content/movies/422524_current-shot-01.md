A street, passers-by, a sunset, all accompanied by electronic humming: Current Shot 01 consists of a single 15-min shot [...] But the apparent stillness of the shot turns out to be deceptive: while no movement can be seen, the figures' shadows have changed, and a third suddenly leaves the cluster it formed with the other two. As a results of the extreme slow motion, this slight movement can only be recognised after the fact. Like a picture puzzle where you have to look for the differences, the detail oscillates between animated photography, film still and tableau vivant.\r ~ Alexandra Seibel", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nQyAPaT70ZDw1fqnUiLvtveJ3Tc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
