Christel, Paula and Karolina either work in their own apartment, in a brothel, or receive clients at a dominatrix studio. They have no desire to justify what they do, nor do they make a show of their profession. These three women are engaged in a constant merry-go-round of slipping into different identities, selling dreams and trying to manage their own private life. Their multifaceted personalities make it clear just how differently they go about their trade, and what made them choose to earn their bread as a sex worker. The film provides an insight in to the lives of Christel, Paula and Karolina and their sometimes surprisingly middle-class routine.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rpemVykW5RBDv6hbDPg9i8LZvV3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
