When his high-school senior prank goes wrong, his future crumbles before his eyes. In frustration he launches the F**k-It List - of all the things he wishes he'd done but was too afraid. The list goes viral, touches a nerve with teenagers everywhere, and exposes the educational-industrial complex as a money-machine designed to encourage anxiety-ridden parents to sell their kids into years of Tiger-Mom style servitude. Brett decides he's going to break free - and make a run for a future of his own design.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a8xmdooR8aM9ExCxkut0sosQnuq.jpg", "actors": ["Eli Brown (Brett Blackmore)", "Natalie Zea (Kristen)", "Madison Iseman (Kayla)", "Jerry O'Connell (Jeffrey Blackmore)", "Callan Mulvey (Dee)", "Camryn Manheim (Principal Baird)", "Karan Brar (Nico)", "Aqueela Zoll (Natalie Legere)", "Andrew Bachelor (Jasper Zim)", "Marcus Scribner (Clint)", "Kristin Carey (Dean Reilly)", "Diana Toshiko (Bruce's Lady)", "Tristan Lake Leabu (Les)", "Chris Gann (Steve)", "Amanda Grace Benitez (Stacy)", "Chris Silcox (Teen)", "Brandon Bales (Agent Styles)", "Jeffrey Larson (Ted)", "Paul Mabon (School Security Guard)", "Claudio Pinto (Spanish Newscaster)", "Eddie Navarro (Musician)", "Angela Daun (Bruce's girlfriend)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
