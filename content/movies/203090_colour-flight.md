Sponsored by Imperial Airways, it incorporates the airline\u2019s \u201cspeedbird\u201d symbol, and the music consists of \u201cHonolulu Blues\u201d by Red Nichols and a rumba by the Lecuona Cuban Boys. Time Magazine raved about the film, describing Lye as England\u2019s alternative to Walt Disney (a David-and-Goliath comparison!). Like Lye\u2019s other films, Colour Flight was not eligible for distribution in the US due to its status as an overseas advertising film. - Harvard Film Archive", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/co7khDrw7wWvi8up8M6uZBTnO33.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [197975, 239815, 93496, 203087], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
