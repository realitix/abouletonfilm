He sells his field and uses the money to buy a broken-down old Peugeot 504 from an European couple. Boubacar wants to try his hand at being a bush taxi driver. But very soon, he sees that his dream cannot become reality : the engine of the old jalopy dies on him. Boubacar is ruined. His wife is forced into prostitution in the corn fields to meet the family's needs. But Boubacar is a resourceful, philosophical man. He strips the car down and uses the engine of the 504 as a barbecue to sell grilled corn in the streets. His hopes of being rich are renewed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1BKegFrRUov19mWAOMP65sz7EiO.jpg", "actors": ["Jean Odoutan (Boubacar)", "Laurentine Milebo (Fati)", "Gladys Agboliagbo (Rafia)", "Olivia Agboliagbo (Djita)", "Didier Dorlipo (Didier-Djack (Nuhuru))", "Adama Kouyat\u00e9 (Vieil \u00e9dent\u00e9)", "Koffi Gahou (Beau-fr\u00e8re Boubacar)", "Roland Odoutan (Camara)", "Claire Houngbo (Tante)", "Chim\u00e8ne Agboliagbo (Fifi)", "Guy Sallan (El Hadj Traor\u00e9)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
