It touches on social issues like suicide, drug addiction and homophobia in a tender and humerous way. The story follows Anna Meyer, a schoolgirl who wins the role of Juliet in her school's production of Romeo and Juliet. She struggles to come to terms with the deeper, darker side of her personality; mostly because she still needs to exercise the demons from a tragedy in her own life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eibC5AxFxri9vG3ern06TP4fIhh.jpg", "actors": ["Kate Ascott-Evans (Anna Meyer)", "Theresa Benade (Elise Meyer)", "Sandra Prinsloo (Mrs. Meyer)", "Marius Weyers (Mr. Meyer)", "Alistair Moulton Black (Marcel)", "Paul du Toit (Sebastiaan Meyer)", "Kenneth Fok (Ching-Kung Liu)", "Robin Grimbeeck (Therese)", "Pierre Malherbe (Dr. Snyman)", "Makgano Mamabolo (Thoko)", "Lizz Meiring (Brodie)", "Sizwe Msuthu (Paramedic)", "Ruan Burger (Boy sweeping the stage)", "Brendan Pollecutt (Julian)", "Ilse Schmidt (Mrs. Verster)", "Royston Stoffels (Mr. Khoor)", "Poppy Tsira (Florence)", "Nsika Nxumalo (Alan)", "June van Merch (Melina)", "Bruce Little (Freddy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
