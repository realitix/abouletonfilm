There is no director credited. For a few years in the late thirties, \"nudist colony\" movies were quite popular on the \"sexploitation\" circuit. Notice that the girls featured with bare breasts are quite attractive, more so than average people who might be in the colony. These are probably models and aspiring actresses brought in for the movie only. As one producer of the time put it, \"If you are going to make a nudist colony movie, bring your own nudists\" Notice the title. Nudism is a \"racket.\" an indication of the middle class morality which is imposed on all these movies. Also note how they make fun of the fat woman. This is another aspect of these films.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dk5wFJYsThqYX5qWqsCCRariLE7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
