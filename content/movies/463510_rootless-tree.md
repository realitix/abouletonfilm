They receive him with great understanding and sympathy but cannot find the key to his heart. Torn out of his natural environment and left bewilderingly rootless, this good man cannot adapt himself to the urban way of life. He does not like the mayonnaise he is offered, does not know how to use the lift. The people hurrying in the streets seem to him indifferent, and some even sly and deceitful. He sees the city as a place full of hostile people and inanimate objects. He badly misses the warm human touch of his village. Death is the only possible solution to the tragic conflict of this peasant, crucified between the archaic and the modern, and unable to adapt to the urban lifestyle.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4NcFEsY4SxBQGAIasnh2djXy5rJ.jpg", "actors": ["Nikola Dadov (Gatyo)", "Nevena Kokanova (Daughter-in-law)", "Marin Yanev (Son)", "Pavel Popandov (Photographer)", "Nikolay Kedev (Vnucheto)", "Sasho Simov (Botyo)", "Evangeliya Tuparova (Zhenata na Gatyo)", "Georgi Bilalov (Predsedatel na TKZS)", "Georgi Hristov (Vatmanat)", "Nikolay Nachkov (Pticharyat)", "Radka Sarafova (Starata zhena)", "Damyan Antonov (Partien sekretar)", "Ivan Gaydardzhiev (Doktorat)", "Anton Marinov (General)", "Pencho Bogdanov (Plamen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
