Sporting a new pirate-like look, Mum also stars in the film as Nai-hua Perm, a heartless man who seeks vengeance against the family responsible for the death of his sister. Also starring in Tas Rak Asoon are 27-year-old actress Savika Chaiyadej (Pinky), who plays a spoiled rich kid, and 31-year-old sexy star Lukkana Wattanawongsiri (Aum), who plays an island girl named Jet Ski. Throughout the film, the two women fight for the affections of Nai-hua Perm.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5SzQyB5ZzAUuASlGJIEPPb7MPN5.jpg", "actors": ["Petchtai Wongkamlao (Mum)", "Sawika Chaiyadech (Demon)", "Sakaojai Poonsawatd (Lady)", "Lukkana Wattanawonsiri (Other)", "Supaksorn Chaimongkol ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ieyTHaivMLg"}
