The special was directed by Bill Miller, and produced by Harold Davison.  Sinatra was introduced on stage by Grace Kelly. Kelly had starred alongside Sinatra in the 1956 film High Society, the last film she made before her marriage to Rainier III, Prince of Monaco.  Sinatra had been follicularly challenged for many years, hence all the hats in publicity stills, album covers etc. TV directors were forbidden to photograph him from the back because of this. However, at this concert, Sinatra had completed a very successful hair transplant and deliberately turned his back on the main audience a couple of times to acknowledge the audience sitting backstage, along with running his hand over the back of his head to draw attention to his new coiffure.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rsP9W42wc9ZTgtBiQhzTCbVz5HV.jpg", "actors": ["Frank Sinatra ()", "Grace Kelly ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
