Witness this 73-minute document from her '79 tour, which finds her backed by her greatest band eve. Mitchell's The Hissing of Summer Lawns-Hejira-Mingus period is heavily favored; there are two tunes from Court and Spark, but nothing earlier. It's not perfect--the film clips edited into the live tracks (at Mitchell's direction) are an annoying distraction (Rebel Without a Cause? Huh?). But by the time Mitchell, Mays, and vocal group the Persuasions finish a spine-tingling version of the title song, you'll have witnessed something special--and historic, as this was the only time this stellar crew toured together. --Sam Graham", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fhp3JyYq5Vjs86rrY3damy2xSYC.jpg", "actors": ["Jaco Pastorius (Jaco Pastorius (bass))", "Joni Mitchell (Joni Mitchell (electric guitar, vocals))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "7HHjJG7yWBE"}
