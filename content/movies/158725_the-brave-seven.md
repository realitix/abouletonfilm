When their ship departs, they unpack only to find a young stowaway, who romanticized Arctic heroes, and tried to join them on multiple occasions finally succeeding. That's how six became seven.  Life of polar explorers is tough, and full of danger. During one year they are largely isolated from the mainland, and should survive using their resourcefulness, smarts, knowledge, and existing supplies with occasional unreliable radio communications. The Seven are resilient, cheerful, they forged a true friendship. Now they are ready to face the unforgiving Arctic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6mENQYjY18sTZ3KOjbzKGohuKih.jpg", "actors": ["Nikolai Bogolyubov (Iliya Letnikov, expedition leader)", "Tamara Makarova (Zhenya Okhrimenko, medic)", "Ivan Novoseltsev (Bogun, pilot)", "Oleg Zhakov (Kurt Schefer, radio operator)", "Andrei Apsolon (Osya Korfunkel, meteorologist)", "Ivan Kuznetsov (Sasha Rybnikov, mechanic)", "Pyotr Aleynikov (Moliboga, cook)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [81361], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
