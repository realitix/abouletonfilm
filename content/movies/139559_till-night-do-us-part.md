Hilarious and revealing, this is a film about women who choose between affection and money, film producers that don't really know what they're filming, and weary businessmen who sometimes say screw it, down a shot and leave their mother-in-laws to pay the bill. But most of all, it's about true love that favors noisy kitchen floor over gilded fine-dining halls.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rX2NwDZImNUE4bk3RqpZLhKK3MA.jpg", "actors": ["Aleksandr Yatsenko (Waiter Dima)", "Yevgeni Syty (Waiter Volodya)", "Oksana Fandera ()", "Anna Mikhalkova ()", "Mariya Shalaeva ()", "Sergey Shnurov ()", "Avdotya Smirnova (restaurant visitor)", "Lyubov Tolkalina ()", "Aleksandr Robak ()", "Vasiliy Utkin ()", "Grigory Kalinin ()", "Alexandra Rebenok ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
