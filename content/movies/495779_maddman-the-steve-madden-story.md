The film provides intimate access to Madden as it explores how he repeatedly nearly destroyed his life through drugs, through alcohol, and through a single-minded determination to build his business no matter what the cost to his personal life, and even to his freedom.

Throughout it all, Madden has maintained an uncanny charm, clever wit, endless creativity, and a keen instinct that has shaken the fashion world to its core.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ecD7bKAbiL25SWajhthsV6upmJM.jpg", "actors": ["Steve Madden (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [474048, 209023, 342286, 326817], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
