Set in the early 1980s, The Cherokee Word for Water begins in the homes of a small town in rural Oklahoma where many houses lack running water and others are little more than shacks. The movie is told from the perspective of Wilma Mankiller and full-blood Cherokee organizer Charlie Soap who join forces to battle opposition and build a 16-mile waterline system using a community of volunteers. In the process, they inspire the townspeople to trust each other, to trust their way of thinking, and to spark a reawakening of the universal indigenous values of reciprocity and interconnectedness. This project also inspired a self-help movement in Indian Country that continues to this day.  The movie is dedicated to Wilma Mankiller\u2019s vision, compassion and incredible grace.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/YRpS4Dtz6bslEmPExf43KAOYk1.jpg", "actors": ["Kimberly Guerrero (Wilma Mankiller)", "Mo J.
