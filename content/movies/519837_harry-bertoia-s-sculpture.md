The film is one of constant motion, resulting from the vertiginous movements of West's camera, or the movement built into the sculptures themselves. The music, played by Bertoia, utilizing various objects alternately hammering or caressing his sculptures, is reminiscent of the work of Xenakis.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cICGnpJu72eToIz7GwA19jELeAz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
