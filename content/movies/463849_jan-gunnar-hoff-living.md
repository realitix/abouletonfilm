His personal blend of different styles and influences is presented in its purest form - simply music. Some of Hoff's pieces are meditative and expressive, while others have a strong rhythmic nerve, creating contrast and variation in the programme.  Jan Gunnar Hoff has worked extensively as a bandleader and jazz artist since 1992, developing a distinctive musical style. His band with a.o. Audun Kleive and Bj\u00f8rn Kjellemyr had its breakthrough at Vossa Jazz 1995 and later played at the London Jazz festival, Molde Int. Jazz festival and several major festivals and venues in Scandinavia.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8c2O1kWCweSd4vb9XMcX6m50Fh6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
