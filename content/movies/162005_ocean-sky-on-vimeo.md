I was so thrilled with the results that I dedicated most moonless weekends since then to photographing two things I love the most in nature - the night sky and the Ocean.\r Taking a series of images and combining them into a time lapse video sequence made it even more interesting. I have since experimented with all-night time lapses, panning motion, etc. But most importantly I've enjoyed the journey immensely.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aS8QWZGDCq3HC4zTOIofBBUDg0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
