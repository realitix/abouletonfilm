The story itself rigidly follows the conventions of its subgenre, although because Greek filmmakers were still churning out foustanellas for decades afterward, it hardly seems more dated than the original. Once again, it tells the tale of Mitros (Titos Vandis), a wealthy herd owner with a foster daughter named Astero (Vouyouklaki) whom he marries off to another herd owner, despite the fact that she and his son Thimios (Papamichael) are desperately in love. The other herd owner dies and Astero loses her mind a bit (although she doesn't wig out quite as spectacularly as Aliki Theodoridou in the silent original), but Mitros finally comes to the right decision and allows the children to marry.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/JYbdtGp5rWOTFrvNUq79y2IW8b.jpg", "actors": ["Titos Vandis (Mitros)", "Dimitris Papamichael (Thymios)", "Georgia Vasileiadou (Stamatina)", "Stephanos Stratigos (Thanos)", "Yorgos Damasiotis ()", "Athanasia Moustaka ()", "Giannis Avlonitis ()", "Niki Linardou ()", "Soula Athanasiadou ()", "Theodoros Andrikopoulos ()", "George Antonakis ()", "Kia Bozou ()", "Z.
