Despite her attempts, Rosalba's persistent attempts to convert him to the rituals of high society, enlightened, or feminine tastes do little more than annoy him.\r Strongly determined to build a stable relationship with a woman who can fulfill his visions of peaceful married life, he leaves for the Amazon, where he is offered the opportunity to choose and buy a new wife as a slave. The choice falls on the beautiful and docile Manua that he trains to act the way he'd like, then proudly shows to friends and to his former wife, attracting curiosity, envy, and his ex-wife's resentment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u8pETAuxStbqUo1WJYDKBorS2xJ.jpg", "actors": ["Lando Buzzanca (Demetrio Cultura)", "Catherine Spaak (Rosalba)", "Adriana Asti (Elena)", "Veronica Merin (Manua)", "Gordon Mitchell (Von Thirac)", "Gianni Bonagura (Balzarini)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
