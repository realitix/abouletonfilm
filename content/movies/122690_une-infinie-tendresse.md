It chronicles his friendship with another youngster even more crippled than himself, their joy in being together, their little spats and, finally, the termination of their friendship by death. Directed by Pierre Jallaud, it is a remarkable achievement, treating its subject creatively yet with complete integrity. There is no commentary, no dialogue, only the natural sounds of the children and their environment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yrIZGadKk7erchmPCba78eqxkjg.jpg", "actors": ["Jos\u00e9 Guerra ()", "Jeanne Lennox ()", "France-No\u00eblle ()", "John Ainsworth ()", "Serge Rachevsky ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
