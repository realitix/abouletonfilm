Money is another problem and there\u2019s little chance they\u2019ll find any. So Pong Ddol offers Chul-wook the job of band manager if he helps with financing. Strong emotions and subtle humor add depth to a film that may seem reminiscent of the instinctive wit seen in the work of Hong Sang-soo. Although the story involves a heterogeneous group of individuals who have been marked by traumas from the past, music has the potential to bring people together and smooth over old wounds, thereby allowing the story to move toward a positive resolution. But resolution doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019ll become stars \u2013 and they couldn\u2019t care less.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wUPoE5B0vABxny6XVKRpbAnjmGZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
