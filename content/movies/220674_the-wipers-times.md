Full of gallows humour, The Wipers Times was poignant, subversive and very funny. Produced literally under enemy fire and defying both authority and gas attacks, the magazine proved a huge success with the troops on the western front. It was, above all, a tribute to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming adversity. In his spare time, Roberts also managed to win the Military Cross for gallantry.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cEQD1pwLVqh4j17BhLO2VeAwFca.jpg", "actors": ["Ben Chaplin (Roberts)", "Julian Rhind-Tutt (Pearson)", "Michael Palin (General Mitford)", "Emilia Fox (Kate Roberts)", "Ben Daniels (Lieutenant Colonel Howfield)", "Josh O'Connor (Dodd)", "Steve Oram (Sergeant Harris)", "Patrick Fitzsymons (Deputy Features Editor)", "Jarrod Cooke (Henderson)", "Colin Ash (Smith)", "Hugh Skinner (Barnes)", "Richard Doubleday (ADC Bobby)", "Paul Kennedy (Winston Churchill)", "Emma Little (Field Nurse)", "Faolan Morgan (Chaplain)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [47913, 38982, 35463, 26156], "youtube_key": "HH9Kvv56AHw"}
