A forgotten legend, her story ranks alongside the courage of 'La Pasionaria' and the legendary 'Odette'. Whilst both these women sustained world-wide recognition, our Scots heroine dwindled into obscurity and remains forgotten to this day. Ethel MacDonald's own intimate recollections are presented through a definitive mix of documentary and drama, re-visiting the Killing Fields that were the Spanish Civil War. Supporting commentary spoken by David Hayman paired with expert interviews, including Noam Chomsky, provides background knowledge of 1930's European Politics and a further insight into the young Scot's motives, actions and social situation.  The film links her own personal drama to specific archive footage of Barcelona in disarray - an image Ethel MacDonald came to know so well.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6jzHu0WguqWKnxwSDy7PA3hplbt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "A6_X5m32jM0"}
