They prefer to use lying, cheating, stealing, or brute force. Take, for instance, the pharmacy student who uses his skils to make date-rape drugs, and he sells these concoctions in order to pay tuition. While each \"dirtbag\" has his own plotline, all become obstacles to the main character - a dirtbag who is at the crossroads of change. Will he find redemption or destruction?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sYN4I9COeILNPGZD3l4fzBMtFNf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
