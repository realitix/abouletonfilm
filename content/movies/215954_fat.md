Addicted to food, and bad health in general, he is headed on a one way path to an early grave. Despite help from his friends, he does what he wants, until a chance encounter that might just give him the motivation he needs. Fat is a funny, and dramatic look at food addiction. It is an unflinching story based on Mark Phinney's own experiences and writings on the subject.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g6PgJdW1vsI0njDM8pEGdo2YfNn.jpg", "actors": ["Charlene Amoia (Jill)", "Ellen Soderberg ()", "Mel Rodriguez ()", "Bristol Pomeroy ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "j36gxULpCDY"}
