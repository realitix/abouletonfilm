I was curious because I had found, also in Mill Creek 50-packs (I think the same one, 'Nightmare Worlds', though it could have been 'Drive-In Movie Classics') Tallas' much-later 'Cataclysm', which, though low-budget, was atmospheric and decent, and the horror portmanteau 'Night Train of Terror', which had a condensed version of that film, much later directed by Tallas, in a collaboration with two others.\r\n\r\nI'm glad I saw this once, as it was charming and fun, but I was fortunate it was short and didn't outstay its welcome. Worth a watch if you can stand the faded colour of the brutal print quality and that it's hacked to full frame screen format."}], "recommandations_id": []}
