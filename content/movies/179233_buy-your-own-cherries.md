When she refuses a cherry to a roughly-dressed tradesman who runs a tab at the bar, he pays off his debt in a huff, using all his week's pay. He then storms penniless and without provisions into his ill-furnished house where his wife and two children, ill-clad and ill-fed, cower. Is there any hope for him and for his family? If he does realize how low he's sunk, what help is there to lift him up? Will the family ever know the taste of cherries?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mz1uRSQW39YIuteK6aH8gkbaSCz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [178991, 178996, 139589, 122036], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
