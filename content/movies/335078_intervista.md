This brief film offers some poignant vignettes of contemporary life in Albania... [and] also underscores the reluctance of Albania's former Communist elite to confront its past. Both the quality of its content and its length make Intervista a potentially valuable instructional resource", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uU36vdyZ7lxn4qfPrWHfrk8YRyG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
