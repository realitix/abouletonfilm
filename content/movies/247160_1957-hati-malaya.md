While two of them grudgingly carry out the request made by the publisher, Zahari, one of them takes on the role enthusiastically. Along the way, they find themselves immersed in the characters, emotional moments, identifying with and finding meaning in the struggle of \u20181957\u2019. They weave the story of independence by transporting themselves back to the past. Ordinary Malaysians who fell in love, and found their love for the country override their personal emotions. The present characters find new meaning to \u2018Merdeka\u2019", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pTdi6qN0XU87WwZHErKR37QXt33.jpg", "actors": ["Maya Karin (Salmi/Normala)", "Sharifah Amani (Ani/Aishah)", "Rusdi Ramli (Hali/Zahari)", "Mohd Kamarulzaman (Tunku Abdul Rahman)", "Zaefrul Nadzarine Nordin (Dato' Onn Jaafar)", "Azhar Sulaiman (Anwar bin Abdul Malik)", "Noor Azhar Murad (Tun Abdul Razak)", "Nanu Baharuddin (Datin Sharifah Rodziah)", "Iqram Dinzly (Ahmad Badawi)", "Ida Nerina (Datin Halimah)", "Pushpa Narayan ()", "Kavita Sidhu (Khalilah)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "9vFkyRF7ioU"}
