When their tree hugging daughter Topanga dies in a tragic golf ball accident, Bernie goes off the spiritual deep end and tries to give away their fortune with disastrous results. But what starts off as tragedy quickly turns into career re-invention for Alyssa. And as the body counts rises, so does her star. Bad Actress is a guilty pleasure of a film that gleefully mocks the world of Hollywood and Fame, which reminds us that Justice has nothing on Celebrity.Written by Anonymous (www.imdb.com).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9ebWazuWCD8CGI2kzEN0rS21qsp.jpg", "actors": ["Beth Broderick (Alyssa Rampart-Pillage)", "Chris Mulkey (Bernie Pillage)", "Whitney Able (Rebecca Pillage)", "Vincent Ventresca (Morris Pillage)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Mnx6VxRLiS0"}
