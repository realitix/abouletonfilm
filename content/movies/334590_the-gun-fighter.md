At their headquarters, in the Gila Mountains, in consultation with \"Ace High,\" his lieutenant, he plans depredations on the neighboring settlements. Although Hudspeth is powerful, their rule is disputed by El Salvador, a half-breed, and his following of desperadoes. Desert Pass is the scene of many conflicts between the contending bands. Rumors of the arrival of miners with gold causes El Salvador to send \"Cactus\" Fuller, his henchman, to levy tribute by a hold-up, which is successful. Flushed with triumph, he boasts in the \"Golden Fleece\" saloon of the ignominies to which he would treat Cliff Hudspeth if he ever met him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/goGYo4OtANEKdGssOMrTdJicfh7.jpg", "actors": ["William S.
