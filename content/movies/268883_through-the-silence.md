A well-intentioned Christian gives in to the temptation of a young widow: a mayor succumbs to his greed: an elderly lady adopts a young burn victim: a doctor breaks away from a past that had hardened her heart: an old priest comes and goes trying to understand and a lost poet rediscovers his capacity to love and write.
