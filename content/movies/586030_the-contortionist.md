She manages to cover every square inch of  the room before the film is done. Greer's friends often mention that she used to like to tie herself up in knots and stay in contorted positions, as well as sit in unusual poses that demonstrate her flexibility, so she and her sister created this home movie on VHS.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oEfbWLZK8G5uXfSZm2nJmjGYyQl.jpg", "actors": ["Greer Lankton (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
