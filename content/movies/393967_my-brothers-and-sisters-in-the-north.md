The native Korean director Sung-Hyung Cho tries to understand this by accompanying several Koreans from different backgrounds in their daily lives. The film shows the country and its people in a way, as it is rarely done in Western media, non-judgmental and respectful towards the people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f38fSEkRkLY0iHxn62AWDx3Do3r.jpg", "actors": ["Sung Hyung Cho (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
