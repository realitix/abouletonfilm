It is a notorious landmark. Ester Paraiso, a retired prostitute, runs the place with help from her own daughter, Daria, whom she is preparing for the job, and from influential politicos. Her daughter, however, decides to run away but is later spurned by her suitor and his offer of a respectable life.
