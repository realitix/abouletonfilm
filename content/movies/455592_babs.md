Preparing to perform in the theatre one cold evening in 1993, the cheeky, chirpy blonde Babs recounts the people and events that have shaped her life and career over fifty years from 1943 to 1993. She contemplates her lonely childhood and WWII evacuation, her decision to go from Barbara Ann Deeks to Barbara Windsor - inspired by the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, her complicated relationship with her father, her doomed marriage to Ronnie Knight, capturing the attention of Joan Littlewood and becoming the blonde bombshell in the Carry On films. Babs, ever the consummate professional, never lets her fans down whatever her personal anguish and steps on the stage to rapturous applause.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oK3tpaKgGIZQe6LTrMZjTHMvS5L.jpg", "actors": ["Jaime Winstone (Barbara Windsor (Young Adult))", "Samantha Spiro (Babs)", "Nick Moran (John Deeks)", "Leanne Best (Rose Deeks)", "Zo\u00eb Wanamaker (Joan Littlewood)", "Barbara Windsor (Barbara Windsor)", "Honor Kneafsey (Teen Barbara)", "Florence Keen (Child Barbara)", "Luke Allen-Gale (Ronnie Knight)", "Julia Ford (Julie Deeks)", "Nathan Harmer (Brian Mickey)", "Marty Cruikshank (Aida Foster)", "Peter Hamilton Dyer (Producer)", "Alex MacQueen (Peter Charlesworth)", "Charlie Archer (Scott Mitchell)", "Jerry-Jane Pears (Jayne Mansfield)", "Daniel Ben Zenou (Lionel Bart)", "Lewis Kirk (Johnny Brandon)", "Tom Forbes (Warren Beatty)", "Rob Compton (Ronnie Kray / Reggie Kray)", "Toby Wharton (Charlie Kray)", "Adam Lazarus (Theatre Performer (uncredited))", "Sue Elliott-Nichols (Barbara's Shoe Shop Manager)", "Tom Machell (Man in Shoe Shop)", "Hannah Hutch (Wife)", "Ross Green (Ronnie Scott)", "James Atherton (Cliff (Saxophonist))", "Dean Roberts (Stan)", "Todd Von Joel (Neil)", "Lewis Maiella (Chuck)", "Jonathan Rhodes (Peter Noble)", "Laurent Maurel (Monsieur Vincent)", "Rob Hughes (Bernard Cribbins)", "Robin Sebastian (Kenneth Williams)", "Nicholas Asbury (Gerald Thomas)", "Joe Stilgoe (Shepard Coleman)", "Jacob Krichefski (Slim Cattan)", "Cally Lawrence (Wardrobe Mistress)", "Robert East (Divorce Judge)", "Matthew Bates (Rosie's Lawyer)", "Rebecca Lee (Jayne's Assistant)", "Rose Robinson (Hat Girl)", "Nicola Munns (Young Actress)", "Billy Burke (Dancer (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [42484], "youtube_key": "V185Ii19YHQ"}
