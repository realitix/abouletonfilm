Lloyd Nolan is top-billed as a cynical reporter with a penchant for sticking his neck out too far. Frank Albertson costars as a cub reporter fresh out of journalism school, whose presence is resented by Nolan and his fellow workers. But it is Albertson who, after running afoul of the law, is instrumental in breaking up a ring of racketeers. Behind the News was remade by Republic as Headline Hunters (55).", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Lloyd Nolan (Stuart Woodrow)", "Doris Davenport (Barbara Shaw)", "Frank Albertson (Jeff Flavin)", "Robert Armstrong (Vic Archer)", "Paul Harvey (D.
