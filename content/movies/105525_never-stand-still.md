This documentary tells the remarkable story of how an abandoned Massachusetts farm has evolved into a National Historic Landmark and a nexus for dance throughout the world. Its unlikely purchase by choreographer Ted Shawn during the Great Depression allowed this secluded site in the Berkshires to become the internationally renowned Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival. Through candid conversations with world-class choreographers and dancers, thrilling performances, backstage access, and rare footage from the Pillow's Archives, 'Never Stand Still' immerses the viewer in this most ephemeral of art forms, celebrating not only its value to our culture but to our lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vwuMNLEZIxoF61OV22QlO76Qyfw.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Irwin (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
