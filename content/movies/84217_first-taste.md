A boy living a quiet, picturesque life in the Filipino province, spending his days swimming in the sea, is offered a job as a \"film star\" when a shady \"talent scout\" visits his small village. He promises the naive Leo that he can \"make him a star.\" Leo, excited at the idea of escaping his seemingly mundane life, accepts the offer, thus beginning his journey to the city of Manila, where he will learn some hard facts about the world he lives in.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oBpzsNIFPaxk3tUlpgX2XmqVMm7.jpg", "actors": ["Ran Domingo (Leo)", "Paolo Rivero ()", "Ynez Veneracion (Milagring)", "Simon Ibarra ()", "Kenjie Garcia ()", "Lou Veloso ()", "Mely Soriano ()", "Darry Dela Cruz ()", "Nomer Sadiasa ()", "Melon Antonio ()", "Rene Clarido ()", "Demie Aldave ()", "Ike Sadiasa ()", "Alondra Catabay ()", "Marvin Canetes ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
