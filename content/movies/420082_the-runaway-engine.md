The indignant parent suggests that as he has studied hard for several years, a trip to Europe would be in order. Allan, however, tells his father he is ready to go to work and wants to begin at once. Further, that he wants to learn the railroad business from the bottom up and asks for an opportunity to start as a fireman. While following his vocation he meets the daughter of Steve Martin, his engineer and falls in love at first sight. Industriously prosecuting his suit they become formally engaged and Allan advises his father by wire. The receipt of the message angers President Peters. He orders his private car got ready and hurries to the division where Allan is employed in an effort to rescue him from what he terms a misalliance.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Alice Joyce (The Engineer's Daughter)", "William Clarence Rowe (Railroad worker)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
