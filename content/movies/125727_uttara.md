Wrestling, however, despite its aggression and physical combat, turns into an expression of close bonding for Nimai and Balaram, a bond already established through their complementary work at the flag station. Wrestling, for them, is a way of releasing physical energy and a form of dynamic entertainment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gxQaxHHdjxHOFcuqvUXfGi9QTeZ.jpg", "actors": ["Jaya Seal (Uttara)", "Tapas Pal (Nemai)", "Shankar Chakraborty (Balram)", "Saurav Das ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
