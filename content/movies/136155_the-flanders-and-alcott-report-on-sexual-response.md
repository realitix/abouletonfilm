Want to see a bizarre blend of Sci-Fi, S&amp;M and drooling psychedelic hardcore madness? (I didn\u2019t think so.) But The Sex Machine is breathtaking in its weirdness. It reaches new levels of fucked-upness.  Take a gander at this plot. \"The Meadows Foundation\" is a research laboratory run by dedicated scientist Dr. Flanders and his shapely assistant Dr. Phyllis Alcott (CHERI ROSTAND), an Ivory Snow blonde. The place was named after their leader, Dr. Meadows, \"an underground practicing abortionist.\"  The two doctors, dressed in lab coats and clutching clipboards, conduct experiments on \"surrogates\" - people whose libidos are damaged. Mainly, they hook up battery cables to naked, spread-eagled women.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/12FSLCuaY3Pa3DScvItAePYMl2e.jpg", "actors": ["The Sex Machine (The Sex Machine)", "Cheri Rostand (Dr. Phyllis Alcott)", "Samas (Angela Justin)", "John Dullaghan (Dr. Leon Flanders)", "Gerard Broulard (John Alworth)", "Debra Christian (Jessica Waters)", "Kim Dupont (Charlotte)", "Kathy Hilton (Sylvia)", "Annette Michael (Annette Drexel)", "Frank Harris (Joe Drexel)", "William Kirschner (Dr. Christian Meadows)", "Heather Starr (Dr. Elizabeth Hansen)", "Pamela Westcott (Ruth Fowler)", "William Howard (Gary Stroll)", "Donna Stanley (Cassy Wilson)", "John Keith (Jerry Fowler (as Robert Keith))", "Maria Arnold (White Girl)", "Al Cormier (Mr. Jarvis)", "Lindis Guinness (Dr. Ann Foster)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
