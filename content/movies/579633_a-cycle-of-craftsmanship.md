The 400 year-old store owner had begun to face some difficult times. Upholding quality, craftsmanship, a dwindling demand for Kyo-Ningyo had culminated into difficulty running a retail space while maintaining the same level of commitment. Eventually the store owner\u2019s decision to close his store had a profound and introspective effect on visvim founder Hiroki Nakamura which led to the creation of this film.
