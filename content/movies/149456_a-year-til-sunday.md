On Sunday 27th of September 1998 the Galway Footbal Team put stop to a famine that had lasted over three decades. In a thrilling encounter in Croke Park, Galway beat Kildare and were crowned 1998 All-Ireland Champions. For the first time in 32 years the Sam Maguire Cup was coming over the Shannon and back to Connaught.  A Year 'Til Sunday reveals what is involved for a panel of thirty young men, chosen by their county, who set off in quest of All-Ireland glory. This film goes beyond the sidelines and into the dressing room for the pre-match, half-time and full-time action. Over a period of 12 months, the palyers are followed through the agony of the training fields to the ecstasy of victory.  This unique, behind-the-scenes material reveals an insight to sport and life as never before seen.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
