The tales showcase an ensemble of familiar faces, and range from stories of compassion and love to reflections on violence and loss. Among them: a disabled beggar quarrels with a woman and ruins her shoes with his wheelchair, provoking onlookers to wrath and pity; a skittish tourist proves to be her own worst enemy; a newlywed trysts with a mysterious sexpot; a commuter helplessly witnesses a suicide attempt; and, in the most affecting segment, a young woman grieves over her mother's imminent death.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pzy2cwGh3fssoxqaIJFWOnMax5x.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Irwin ()", "Christine Lahti ()", "Denis Leary ()", "Kevin Corrigan ()", "Sarita Choudhury ()", "Bonnie Hunt ()", "N'Bushe Wright ()", "Lili Taylor ()", "Michael Rapaport ()", "Steve Zahn ()", "Jerry Stiller ()", "Nicole Ari Parker ()", "Ajay Naidu ()", "Danny Hoch ()", "Mekhi Phifer ()", "Taral Hicks ()", "Mercedes Ruehl ()", "Rosie Perez ()", "Gretchen Mol ()", "Anne Heche ()", "Gregory Hines ()", "KRS-One ()", "Tina North ()", "Paul Lazar ()", "Andre B.
