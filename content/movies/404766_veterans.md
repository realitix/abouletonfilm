{"tmdb_id": 404766, "title": "Veterans", "original_title": "Veterans", "slug_title": "veterans", "date": "", "genre": ["Documentaire"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "'Veterans', focuses on WW2 veterans, once fighters in the Red Army and now uprooted immigrants, fighting for their place in society. These people, who experienced the twentieth century's bloodiest war as Soviet soldiers, immigrated to Israel after the collapse of the Soviet Union and found themselves in a society that is totally indifferent to their glorious past. The film offers a close and compassionate look at the veterans' lives, fueled by complexity, pain, and an almost silent insult, alongside joy and self-deprecating humor. The feeling of living on borrowed time drives the veterans to embark on what may be their last adventure.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pv2efKS0sohZBTrkzlsr9bdVjrB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
