Characteristic of these portraits is a sense of mocking irony directed not at their subjects (on the contrary, the filmmaker\u2019s affection for them is palpable) but at the \u201cSoviet hero\u201d genre. The subject of this film is Apolinaras, a kindhearted policeman who even outwardly looks very unlike the ideological \u201cguardian of morals.\u201d.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
