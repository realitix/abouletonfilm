Photographer Vancs\u00f3 Zolt\u00e1n uses cinema as an irregular photo gallery to invite viewers for a close to 70-minute meditative journey. So there is no need to prepare for dialogue or an explicit story: the experience is based on photographs, taken mostly in forests, using a special, stunningly impressionistic technique, and a matching, meditative soundtrack, jointly created with Tius.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yu05spO8YStjG03i4YBIL5Li5ji.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
