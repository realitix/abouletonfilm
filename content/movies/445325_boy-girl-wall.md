It's pretty clear that their respective, unsatisfying lives would improve enormously if they just met each other. But with a wall literally between them, this seems highly improbable.  Then there's the building's Power Box, having an existential crisis about the eventual collapse of the universe, and the super nova from five thousand years ago. Then there's time travelling on an equation for the speed of light and too much sugar. There's demon magpie attacks, laptops in love, cats dancing to Prince and sock puppet nightmares. And a tiny prayer by the Wall, hoping that all of these pieces can come together for one magical moment of love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/twA6y4CO2C8H03gz0cQ5m2Jb8OK.jpg", "actors": ["Lucas Stibbard (All Characters)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "mufvqB-4wXA"}
