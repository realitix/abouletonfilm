His real interest is writing a kung-fu comic book which he has titled I'm a Public Official, featuring a crime-fighting bureaucrat and his two nerdy friends (based on himself and his slacker friends Min-gu and Park). Gil-ho then meets Kim Jung-sook, when he tags along to a meeting where she berates Min-gu into taking responsibility for her pregnant best friend Seung-hee. Gil-ho and Jung-sook realize that they knew each other years ago in college, when she was geeky and similarly hot-tempered and Gil-ho couldn't stand her. After unexpectedly sleeping together after a party, the two begin dating and eventually move in together, with Jung-sook having a regular job as a manager at a water-purifying company. Gil-ho gets an offer from a comic book publisher, but his lack of ambition and inability to commit to anything start to take their toll on their relationship.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hBzWas8FVcL5lq9fhBfauTeR6Wr.jpg", "actors": ["Oh Jung-se (Han Gil-ho)", "Jo Eun-ji (Kim Jung-sook)", "Song Sam-dong (Min-gu)", "Lee Mi-do (Sung-hee)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "-F8R3-r_6TU"}
