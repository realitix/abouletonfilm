Even though there are professional footballers, they are all unemployed. And they look desperately for a job. \"The Other Fields\" sheds a new and completely different light on the mythologies of contemporary football. While some may think that \u201cbling-bling\u201d and \u201cglitz\u201d is all there is to modern football, Marco Kugel\u2019s and Simon Quack\u2019s film shows the intricate economic and moral complexities behind the fa\u00e7ade of entertainment. Dreams only last a season or two.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aTvx5TOUXUBwFQSoHIbc4BVQw87.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
