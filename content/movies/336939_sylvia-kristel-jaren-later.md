Part doc and part video art, there is certainly a sort of tragic and forlorn tone to film that seems to sum up Kaganof's thoughts on Kristel's life and career.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sFuko4JYq2E5QAppyCwCFUJAWwZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
