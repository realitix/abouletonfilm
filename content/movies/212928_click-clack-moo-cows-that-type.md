To the harassed farmer's dismay, his communicative cows quickly become contentious.  When he refuses to comply with their demands, the cows take action. Farmer Brown finds another note on the barn door: \"Sorry. We're closed. No milk today.\" Soon the striking cows and Farmer Brown are forced to reach a mutually agreeable compromise, with the help of an impartial party--the duck. But this poor, beleaguered farmer's \"atypical\" troubles are not over yet!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
