In Di Paolo's fifth special he skillfully mines the humor in such light hearted topics as Suicide and Roadside Memorials while also educating you on the finer points of A**hole Bleaching and the Evolution of Pornography.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vYndZmpaB1EjR7WPpKE6rdq7oZh.jpg", "actors": ["Nick Di Paolo (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "oTt-XgnOPrY"}
