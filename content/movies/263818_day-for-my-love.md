The little girl, four years old, is not aware that she is doing anything distressing while she ambles about the house on the day after a post-examination celebration by her father, a university student. Even though hung over, he tries hard to be patient with her. The beginning of the story follows her on her little adventures. The girl comes down with a fever, which kills her before anything can be done, and the student and his photographer wife mourn and comfort one another. Little encounters with children cause the mother pain she is seldom free of, until she gives birth to their next child, a son.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xj9QZ3vxAhiXJetwM9aVORnUCpp.jpg", "actors": ["Marta Van\u010durov\u00e1 (Marie)", "Vlastimil Harapes (Petr)", "Sylva Kamenick\u00e1 (Maruska)", "Jirina Sejbalov\u00e1 (Mrs. Bernardov\u00e1)", "Dana Med\u0159ick\u00e1 (Petr's mother)", "Josef Laufer ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
