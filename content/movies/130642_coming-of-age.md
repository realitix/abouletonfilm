Both thought that at eighty they have experienced everything until, like a bolt of lightening, Rosa and Bruno come together and immediately fall head over heels. There are two obstacles to their happiness though: Bruno\u2019s marriage, which has long been routine, and Rosa\u2019s illness; she has cancer and not long left to live. Despite the difficult circumstances, the two decide to breakaway \u2013 Bruno from his relationship and Rosa from her retirement home. Against the advice of carers, doctors and relatives, the pair moves into a new apartment together. ANFANG 80 shows with a great deal of unequivocal humour how insensitively and sometimes desperately overburdened society reacts to love among the elderly.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kHHAhyLNubIsfmBCYOzxQ1FTvvL.jpg", "actors": ["Christine Ostermayer (Rosa)", "Karl Merkatz (Bruno)", "Erni Mangold (Herta)", "Branko Samarovski (Karl)", "Susi Stach (Waltraud)", "Julia Jelinek (R\u00f6ntgenschwester)", "Inge Maux (Frau Binders Schwester)", "Martin Oberhauser (Polizist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
