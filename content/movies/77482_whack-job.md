This spoiled mafia princess has just discovered her boyfriend Darren in bed with another woman (Kaylani Lei). What's the daughter of a mobster to do? Get even, of course! When daddy refuses to put a hit out on the cheating boyfriend, Adrianna takes matters into her own hands and convinces two hit men to take the job. Unfortunately for everyone involved, these goons are bumbling idiots and manage to hilariously screw up every attempt at whacking Darren. In a strange turn of events, the unsuspecting Darren doesn't end up \"sleeping with the fishes\"...instead he ends up actually rescuing the men sent to kill him, meaning the only real whack job in this story is head case Adrianna!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yfsk3tikvvXLi8eShBU2fGcV22t.jpg", "actors": ["Roxy DeVille (Adrianna Di'Angelo)", "Kaylani Lei (Mia)", "Lexi Lamour (Orgy Girl)", "Nikki Rhodes (Orgy Girl)", "Alexa Jordan (Orgy Girl)", "Gianna Lynn (Orgy Girl)", "Veronica Rayne (Gina (The Trophy Wife))", "Ethan Cage (Orgy Guy)", "Jack Vegas (Orgy Guy)", "Mr. Pete (Orgy Guy)", "Tommy Gunn (The Gangster)", "Tony De Sergio (The Hitman)", "Derrick Pierce (Darren (The Boyfriend))", "Marcus London ()", "Dan Davis (Bodyguard)", "Art Koch ()", "Paul Allen (The Boss)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
