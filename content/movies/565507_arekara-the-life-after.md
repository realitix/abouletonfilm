I spent several days in the North, under the snow, listening to these people talk candidly about what they had lived through, telling their own stories without the media as an intermediary. Their testimonies were terrifying, harsh and sad, but at the same time touching, sincere and human. From the pictures and interviews that I collected, I decided to make a film, not to reflect how awful the events were, but to communicate the singular and even surreal nature of each person\u2019s experience. My intention wasn\u2019t so much to focus on this particular event in Japan, but rather to make these stories more universal as a way of paying tribute to all the victims of natural disasters throughout the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9b1aMXERGRlyf8c4p3bOiEEnDRy.jpg", "actors": ["K\u00f4ichi Nakazato ()", "Shigetsugu Got\u00f4 ()", "Sumiko Abe ()", "Y\u00fbji Ishimori ()", "Hiroko Utsumi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
