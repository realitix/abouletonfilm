It happens. When the spouses have strong, stable relations, connected not only by marriage, but also by the joint business that Tatiana received from her father, and her husband Mark manages all the affairs of the late father-in-law construction company. But if you look into the keyhole and take a closer look, the ideal will suddenly seem imperfect, and a hint of hatred will appear in love and decency. What can break a strong family bond? Passion or deceit? Treason or thirst for vengeance? And if high feelings and low human passions mix up, intertwine and drag on with a strong knot, which can be unleashed only by death?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Mariya Gorban ()", "Liliya May ()", "Anatoly Kot ()", "Yuliya Pozhidaeva ()", "Polina Slepakova ()", "Darya Vershinina ()", "Stanislav Erdley ()", "Albert Bartosh (investor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
