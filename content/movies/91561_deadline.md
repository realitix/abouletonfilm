As he ruminates on his place in any world and loses his grip, he also loses his wife and his children's respect, and critics tear him apart. The final undoing of this screenwriter is a deadline that must be met at all costs, costs that perhaps are too great.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/34kacFpRqUjbwTccZZCpGPZkpFx.jpg", "actors": ["Stephen Young (Steven Lessey)", "Sharon Masters (Elizabeth Lessey)", "Marvin Goldhar (Burt Horowitz)", "Jeannie Elias (Darlene Winters)", "Cindy Hinds (Sharon Lessey)", "Phillip Leonard (Philip Lessey)", "Tod Woodcroft (David Lessey)", "Bev Marsh (Martha Lessey)", "Carole Pope (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [29333, 92788, 48803, 85695], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
