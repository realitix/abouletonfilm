They work on a script, as their wastebasket and ashtrays fill. They head outside to shoot: down a manhole, up a telephone pole, through a keyhole, and at night using binoculars. Next they must edit their film, then it's time for a first screening of their product, \"The Afternoon of a Rubberband.\" It's a montage of experimental images, including a razor blade cutting various objects, a baby in a cooking pot, and a snail in the path of a steamroller. After the screening, the boys wonder if that was their only shot at Hollywood fame.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j5Py45MFqit4QfNOMtfiy2onZvo.jpg", "actors": ["LeRoy Robbins ()", "Roger Barlow ()", "Harry Hay ()", "Hy Hirsh ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [159245], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
