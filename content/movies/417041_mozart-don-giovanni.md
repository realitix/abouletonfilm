But when Don Giovanni commits murder, he unleashes a dark power beyond his control.  Kasper Holten\u2019s production is rich in both colourful comedy and exhilarating drama. Set designs by Es Devlin (Les Troyens) and costume designs by Anja Vang Kragh (Stella McCartney, John Galliano for Christian Dior), with video projections by Luke Halls and choreography by Signe Fabricius, portray the visually entrancing world of Don Giovanni. At the heart of the production are the beauty and invention of Mozart\u2019s dazzling score, which ranges from gorgeous arias and dramatic duets to the brilliant layering of dance melodies that bring Act I to a virtuoso close.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w5unFLPeo5K8qXfB4hJhT5VcDgb.jpg", "actors": ["Mariusz Kwiecien (Don Giovanni)", "Alex Esposito (Leporello)", "V\u00e9ronique Gens (Donna Elvira)", "Malin Bystr\u00f6m (Donna Anna)", "Antonio Poli (Don Ottavio)", "Nicola Luisotti (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
