Recently escaped from Trinity Psychiatric Center, an 'alternative' institution for the wayward, the pair hits the road on a mission from God. Appearing in the form of an aged cowboy named Don, the Almighty enlists Lionel and Tin to inscribe the Final Commandments in order to save the world from its ultimate destruction; rumored to be soon.
