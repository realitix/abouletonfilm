A dancer, social butterfly, model, and humanitarian, Zelda takes life by storm, redefining what it means to be \u201cold\u201d in the process. The film documents Zelda's middle-aged transformation from a typical suburban housewife into a beloved and eccentric creature of New York City nightlife \u2014 attending art openings, dancing nightly, and posing for renowned painters and photographers. Some of her friends question whether she is being exploited by the denizens of the art scene, but there is no doubt about the independence and social consciousness that drives Zelda to travel the world on a one-woman mission to promote global women's rights. Zelda's uniqueness and joie de vivre are a testament to the fact that life can be lived to the fullest at any age.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Zelda Kaplan (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
