Graham has a terrible secret - an unholy fantasy - which only he and his Mother's pet Jackdaw (McKellen) know about.  Spurred on by the sinister bird and the possibility of consummating his perverse desire, will Graham do the deed before his Mother uncovers the awful truth?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vgBAj9ApsRZYTbC0zJmPOH1FUe0.jpg", "actors": ["Steve Coogan (Graham)", "Julia Davis (Mother)", "Ian McKellen (The Jackdaw)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "GoVcuYUtpO0"}
