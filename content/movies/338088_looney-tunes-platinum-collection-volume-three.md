It was released for Blu-ray on August 12, 2014, and was released for DVD on November 4, 2014. According to Jerry Beck on the Stu's Show from early this year, he said it's the last volume of the series due to the low sales of the second volume in 2012 and no remastering budget for Warner Bros. to remaster more never-before-released on DVD and Blu-ray Looney Tunes shorts.[citation needed] Only 4 cartoons are new to disc. This is the first and only volume where the Blu-ray only has two discs. Included is a 12 page booklet similar to what came with Volume 2.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ozRO9pHleEYFy06JS01ECPc3FYj.jpg", "actors": ["Mel Blanc ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [317193, 338087], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
