They used to perch on the US-Mexican border, waiting to spot illegal immigrants who were trying to run into the United States. Sometimes, without a thought for the immigrants, the boys chased them across the wasteland and back across the border \u2013 just for fun. It was just one of those games boys played to make themselves feel big. But high school\u2019s over now. David is unexpectedly home from his freshman year of college and the War Boys have been reunited.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6wFALdQQWfwghP2FO0OpPyNrEJj.jpg", "actors": ["Benjamin Walker (David)", "Peter Gallagher (Slater)", "Brian J.
