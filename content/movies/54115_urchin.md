He swears to lead them to a paradise within the hollow earth once he finds five noble souls; but until then his followers must steal and deal to support him. A terminally ill hunchback named Goliath, crazed by his approaching death, decides to find the five noble souls and present them to the Old Man;by beheading New Yorkers he deems worthy of the honor. Meanwhile, another Scum-City dweller known as The Kid tries to do the Old Man's bidding, tangling with deadly gangsters and eccentric drug dealers-even though The Kid is only nine and his main weapon is a water pistol filled with acid. As both Goliath and The Kid pursue paths they believe will lead to paradise, they rob, kill;and inevitably confront each other in a grand showdown.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nKAwEsnsQNqFTcgOe7Nh50mrSjg.jpg", "actors": ["Sebastian Montoya (The Kid)", "Rick Poli (Goliath)", "Larry Swansen (The Old Man)", "Gates Leonard (Julia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
