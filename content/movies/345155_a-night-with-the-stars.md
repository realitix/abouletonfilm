In his own inimitable style, Brian takes an audience of famous faces, scientists and members of the public on a journey through some of the most challenging concepts in physics.  With the help of Jonathan Ross, Simon Pegg, Sarah Millican and James May, Brian shows how diamonds - the hardest material in nature - are made up of nothingness; how things can be in an infinite number of places at once; why everything we see or touch in the universe exists; and how a diamond in the heart of London is in communication with the largest diamond in the cosmos.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4Wy0gRUSkWZ5nPBIObWQ7iwVQSH.jpg", "actors": ["Brian Cox (Himself - Presenter)", "Simon Pegg (Himself)", "Liz Bonnin (Herself)", "Konnie Huq (Herself)", "Alice Roberts (Herself)", "Al Murray (Himself)", "Robert Llewellyn (Himself)", "Marcus Brigstocke (Himself)", "James May (Himself)", "Jim Al-Khalili (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
