Composed by jazz pianist Iiro Rantala and written by best-selling novelist Minna Lindgren, Sanatorio Express is a side-splittingly funny opera about modern neuroses and relationships. A great introduction to opera for first-timers, it will also please aficionados with its deep connection to the tradition of comic opera.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Johanna Rusanen ()", "P\u00e4ivi Nisula ()", "Hannu Niemel\u00e4 ()", "Markus Nyk\u00e4nen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
