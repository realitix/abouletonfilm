She discovers why some of us have more of a sweet tooth than others, which sugars you can enjoy guilt-free, why there is so much sugar hidden in food you would think was purely savoury and what effect sugary drinks have on the appetite.  Fiona also helps four Brits, whose sugar-heavy diets could be putting their health at risk, to change their ways. From coming up with low-sugar recipes to finding ways to beat the sweet cravings, they will see whether cutting back to the levels suggested by health authorities is really achievable and what the benefits actually are.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iZcZuKJzIPeIJDMILNbg2m2eKRF.jpg", "actors": ["Fiona Phillips (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
