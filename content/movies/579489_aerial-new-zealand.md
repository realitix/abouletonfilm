No bigger than the state of Colorado, this small country offers an incredibly diverse landscape view that changes dramatically with each mile. From snow-capped mountains to sandy beaches, and from the glacier-carved Fiordland National Park to the crater lake of Mount Ruapehu, New Zealand is a land of extremes. It's a place where fire clashes with ice and people are always pushing the limits.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bgUy2NKPp2tlr1uAEo5iBFlLnp4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
