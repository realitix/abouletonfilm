The showpiece of this troupe of six people is throwing knives. Their glory days are over now, their programme is not of the highest order, yet the magic of circus is still there and their young audiences watch the show with flushed cheeks.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
