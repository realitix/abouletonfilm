But with the beckoning holiday it seems the hatred for the group has grown. So much so that queen bitch Veronica loses her head over it...literally! Now murder has become a popularity contest thanks to Veronica's sidekick Samantha, thinking she's next. This seems true at Cameron's get-together when she gets \"unwrapped\". Now the teens have to barricade themselves and outsmart the killer. But twisted dreams and secret connections threaten their survival and lead to a most twisted finale. In this film, you'd better hold onto your limbs...or you may end up in your own stocking!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iQfe2Q9poeSyvJofbWKVjMLL9Oi.jpg", "actors": ["Alex DiSanto (Cameron)", "Jennifer McNamara (Veronica)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
