Who was already bubbly, but had yet to stumble across the musical formula which would produce her best films like Evergreen (1934), First a Girl (1935), It's Love Again (1936) and Sailing Along (1938). Still very enjoyable in all it's predictability thanks to this sweet gal."}], "recommandations_id": []}
