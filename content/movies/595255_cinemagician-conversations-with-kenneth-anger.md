He is a unique visionary who drifts from pure poetry within his magical filmmaking to sardonic gossip in his bestselling \"Hollywood Babylon\" books. In-between these extremes we find a person who never tires of exploring his own creativity. In this intimate documentary, Anger lets us in on his fascinating life story, his approaches to filmmaking, and his relationship to British occultist Aleister Crowley.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/75xJXiffqUzTrOFpNTH4IID5i6y.jpg", "actors": ["Kenneth Anger ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
