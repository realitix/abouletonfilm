After a drinking contest with some questionable local spirits, three friends wake naked on a beach to discover two are handcuffed to a locked suitcase, one has a strange new tattoo, and none of them have any clue what happened the night before. When they soon find themselves pursued by local gangsters, their only shot at making it home - and to the altar - is to piece together the previous night's events while on the run.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nK9AXSpB3Jh2xwwhxRvCfbNhqtL.jpg", "actors": ["Fiona Sit (Kimmy)", "Yi-fan Chen (Xiwen)", "Janine Chang (Jialan)", "Mike Tyson (Dragon)", "Wang Shuilin (Jingjing)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
