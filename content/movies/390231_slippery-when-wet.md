There is no lack of plot in this potboiler about college chums reuniting to discover the latent and unrealized passion that was always there. The film is a virtual who's who guide to some of the underappreciated but always erotic New York performers of the 70's. Annie Sprinkle plays an offbeat artist, Crystal Sync (billed here as Christa Anderson), who has a field day as a hedonist with a shitkicker Southern drawl, and the scene with a salami sausage is one you will never forget. Sonny does his Elvis impression, and all of them become victims of Crystal Sync's strange sexual orchestration control. Ultimately, C.J. and Hope resolve their problems with an assist from Annie. This is one of those rare films that keeps piling people on people, scene after scene, and yet never loses the erotic edge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aOp3RSKdpNgjfLHL4VHAN6WPBAW.jpg", "actors": ["C.J.
