Michael S. Brunner's research, presented in an easy-to-grasp, fast-paced format, uncovers startling statistics and unexpected linkages; among them, a relationship between early reading failure and juvenile crime. We have all been led to believe that compulsory attendance laws were designed to ensure everyone an education. Brunner's work raises the question: Can, in fact, these laws be counterproductive when methodology is inappropriate? He indicates that the continuing replication of certain curricular policies may well be what is generating many of our current social problems.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
