Fate will do the rest. Composed to a libretto by Meilhac and Hal\u00e9vy based on Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e\u2019s novella, the opera exploded the boundaries between tragedy and comedy with a modernity that caused a scandal at the time. Can we kill the one we love with love? The fiery beauty of Bizet\u2019s music, where one unforgettable aria follows another, has worked year in, year out to make it the world\u2019s most performed opera.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tYtzaMu0rzWcp2jUHD7IvRo0La.jpg", "actors": ["Roberto Alagna (Don Jos\u00e9)", "Cl\u00e9mentine Margaine (Carmen)", "Roberto Tagliavini (Escamillo)", "Aleksandra Kurzak (Mica\u00ebla)", "Vannina Santoni (Frasquita)", "Bertrand de Billy (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
