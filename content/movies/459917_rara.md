This to remind musicians \u2014 especially classically trained ones \u2014 that they are not body-less angels, that they are not just their musical thoughts, that they are still, in the last analysis, flesh and bones. Thus the erotic is not for shocking, but to stress that making music involves the body in a very direct way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rOvXttcVwS1GoXWzJ7Kt3WBo5Wp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
