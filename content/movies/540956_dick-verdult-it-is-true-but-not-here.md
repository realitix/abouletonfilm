He is seen as an outsider, as 'the last Dada-ist'. But what we experience as elusiveness turns out to be quite controlled and firstly funded on very personal experiences from his childhood as a 'Philips child' in Latin America. Rather than experiencing globalism as a problem, Verdult is like a cheerful, transcultural mutant. We see how, at the age of 60, he has become a cult musician in South America, Russia and Japan and is increasingly recognised internationally as a visual artist. This documentary explores Verdult's multidisciplinary, international art practice. We see Verdult at work in his studios in Bergeijk (The Netherlands) and Calanda (Spain) and on tour in Peru, Colombia and Argentina.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y11m4ohxhbzs30rvfnFSzTJf5XK.jpg", "actors": ["Dick Verdult (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
