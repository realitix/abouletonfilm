Ever year rivals Avtar Singh (Sharat Saxena) and Jiten Singh (Om Puri) try to beat each other in the wrestling match and gain the trusteeship of the village. Rama (Rajpal Yadav) plays the role of a village simpleton and a post-master. It filled with misunderstandings and misconceptions, of hidden identities and secret love-affairs and the outcome is simply hilarious. The movie begins to take a turn when a certain someone delivers a secret package in the wrong hands. Especially someone, who is bound to take advantage and manipulate the real owner of the package.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n1RRjhWrXdRsCbsXQL22zhX04uF.jpg", "actors": ["Rajpal Yadav (Chander)", "Nargis Bagheri (Laadli)", "Dalip Singh Rana ()", "Om Puri ()", "Sharat Saxena ()", "Asrani ()", "Mohan Joshi ()", "Asif Basra ()", "Razak Khan ()", "Irrfan Khan ()", "Jagadish (Puncher Pappu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
