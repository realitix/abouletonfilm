A lone taxi stands outside a telephone booth at the bus station in the city of Frunze, waiting for passengers. The taxi pulls out only when full or if someone pays for the entire car. Everyone who approaches the taxi tries to place a call to a loved one, and thus we learn different stories. One passenger, Zoja, is escaping to her parents\u2019 house, fleeing her husband who is cheating on her with a friend of hers. Two passengers who are in transit are debating about a classmate, Muhtar and his wife Mahabat \u2013 will he recognize them, welcome them into his house as late-night guests. The discussion blossoms into a true drama. The taxi driver makes a call home, too, to say good-bye to his wife and ask what to bring his newborn son from far-off Osh. During the night, we learn about the tragedies and joys of the passengers and phone booth users.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Gulmira Tursunbaeva ()", "Asylbek Ozubekov ()", "Kanat Mamyrkanov ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
