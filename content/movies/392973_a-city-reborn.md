The film focusses on reconstruction and morale: we see the city's rebirth through the eyes of a young local couple planning for their future, and an engineer interested in the new housing drive. This is one of several 1940s films introducing cinemagoers to the good old 'prefab'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/krK4jDuacjCiJHKntch116fkO9L.jpg", "actors": ["James McKechnie (Commentator)", "Bill Owen ()", "Betty Mallet ()", "Connie Mason ()", "Charles Rolfe ()", "John Rae ()", "Middleton Woods ()", "Ben Williams (Mr. Evans)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
