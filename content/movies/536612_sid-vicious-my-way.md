Sid then sneers, throws the gun away, and flicks the Vs at the audience and ascends the staircase he walked down to the stage from. For the music video version, director Julien Temple removed the original footage featuring actors playing the audience and the final graphic violence and replaced a few of the audience cutaways with stock footage of a theatre audience from the 1950s (he also drowned out Sid's use of the F-word in the third verse with audience applause). Although the censored version was still controversial, it merely showed Sid wildly shooting a gun towards the crowd.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eweZf9EPRTMtxqmroyLqQE3tpvl.jpg", "actors": ["Sid Vicious ()", "Claude Engel (Guitar)", "Sauveur Mallia (Bass)", "Pierre-Alain Dahan (Drums)", "Simon Jeffes (Orchestral arrangements)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
