I'm not saying its impossible to create a worthwhile movie that's primarily focussed on sex, but come on, this woman who's been in a magic-coma for 400 years has a tattoo on her shoulder of a logo that's been around for less than 50? I mean, what's some concealer cost? Like ten bucks? And you couldn't even be bothered? Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nYou're way better off just watching actual porn, there'll at least be some genitals in that.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u00bd - So bad it\u2019s offensive. I may never fully recover._"}], "recommandations_id": []}
