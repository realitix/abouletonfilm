On May 21, 2011 the deadliest tornado ever recorded struck Joplin, an F5 in which wind gusts exceeded 200 mph. In fact, it was not a single tornado, but a multi-vortex tornado created by two converging storms. As local meteorologist Jeremiah Cook explained, this meant that the half mile wide tornado had several \"fingers,\" each an individual tornado, and the rains were so heavy one could not see them before they struck. Narrator George Noory's jovial voice and the monotone recollections of survivors belie the overwhelming scope of the devastation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pMRlp57ZjiOcn7iwMbKzSEkfVfY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
