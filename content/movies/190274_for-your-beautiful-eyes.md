With Henry Van Vyve in the main role (Labisse and his sister Ninette made an appearance only in the first third of the script), the film was a clear surrealist statement, one year after Un chien andalou.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c3mtvT3f2uVKpAWyjLldFr0Zief.jpg", "actors": ["Alfred Courmes ()", "F\u00e9lix Labisse ()", "Ninette Labisse ()", "Henry Van Vyve ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [150958, 42200], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
