As strange events begin to unfold, the locals become increasingly suspicious to the outsider.  Operating within a cinematic fiction of its own enigmatic design, \u2018A Vacation\u2019 immerses us in a specific yet elusive world where the silent and misty landscapes turn into the site of an equally silent violence and repression. With its evocative imagery and dark-scented ambience, Eroglu\u2019s elliptic narrative offers an analysis of the illusion of freedom and the mechanics of repression at a time when these sort of reflections can be applied all too well to what is happening in the world around us.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9dVq4gY16nHooOhAEXr7CJmOJKP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
