Once in his room, he listens again to a voice message on his cell phone: his lover tells him she is breaking up with him; he is not spontaneous; she has found someone else; don't call. He throws his phone down. When he reaches beneath the bed to retrieve it, he finds a Polaroid photograph of a partially nude woman posed provocatively; it includes a phone number and a sexual question. He opens a beer and stares at the photo. If he calls, what then?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pAHA6ek2bNWTj77J71M1W3mvcdn.jpg", "actors": ["Guillaume Canet (Jean-Paul Cl\u00e9ment)", "M\u00e9lanie Laurent (R\u00e9ceptioniste de H\u00f4tel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
