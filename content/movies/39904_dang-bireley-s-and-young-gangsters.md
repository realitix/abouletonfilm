Dang Bireley's (nicknamed after his favorite soda-pop) had Elvis and James Dean fixations and lived predictably fast and died predictably young. He first killed a man at the age of 13, and became famous in Phra Nakorn as a Chinese protection racketeer from the age of 18. Everything swung his way until one of Thailand's many coups d'etat imposed martial law and drove the city's gangsters up-country. Dang and his loyal cohort Piak had little trouble facing down the local hicks, but bristled when forced to operate a long side their arch-enemy Pu, known as Bottle-Bomb.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7nurJMgX44U4UkhuPQXW0rQo4Tn.jpg", "actors": ["Jesdaporn Pholdee (Dang Bireley)", "Noppachai Muttaweevong (Lam Sing)", "Champagne X (Vallapa)", "Supakorn Kitsuwon (Pu Bottlebomb)", "Attaporn Teemakorn (Piak Wisut Kasat)", "Chartchai Ngamsan (Dum Esso)", "Apichart Chusakul (Sargeant Chien)", "Parichart Borsudhi (Dang's mother)", "Piya Boonnak (Pol Trok Thawai)", "Suthakorn Jaimun (Headman Tek)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
