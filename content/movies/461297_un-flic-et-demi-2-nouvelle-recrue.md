I'm not talking a film like 'Blade Runner'. It was considered a flop, but the concept looked good, particularly for a children's film. This is not a follow up story. Entirely a new cast and a new situation. The story of a young girl Karina, influenced by her late cop father, she's interested in fighting, solving crimes. So she frequently ends up in the principal office in her school. On one day, she comes across a cop who is trying to follow a lead to a man responsible for a series of vandals around the city. This unusual team-up, sees an unexpected success, how it all happens that you should watch it to know.\r\n\r\nThe casting was decent, but the lead two guys were good. Particularly Lulu. Seems one of the future big star on making. The story, it's okayish. Predictable, but also enjoyable. Acceptable graphics, better one for television quality. There were lots of silly scenes, but overall a much entertaining film. Just a cinematic story, it does not make sense in the real world. A film that brings together kids and adults, a pure family film and a perfect weekend film. Such films do not make any harm, only you have to put aside a while your rational mind to have a good time.\r\n\r\n_6.5/10_"}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "dhE1FGL-IzA"}
