The film makes a positive statement through two very selfish and cynical characters and how someone who still believes in honesty and love touches their lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5EtALi5s80f04J7p8cISGtoph2g.jpg", "actors": ["Teo Gebert (Bobby)", "Olivia Pigeot (Tia)", "Susan Prior (Phaedra)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
