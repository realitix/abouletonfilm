This is immensely watchable simply for the presence of Maria De Medeiros, the central two of the film are captivating. What spoils it is the stereotypical and under developed second characters and an overly wistful outlook. But I defy any man watching this film not to fall madly for Aimee and everyone will cherish the scenes between Aimee and Maurice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9WjWmzcfOkVHReN522a954woZfs.jpg", "actors": ["Maria de Medeiros (Aimee)", "Thierry Fortineau (Maurice)", "Jean-Pierre Bacri (Malcolm)", "Anne L\u00e9tourneau (Catherine)", "Ginette Garcin (Arlette)", "Ginette Tacchella (Prudence (as Ginette Mathieu))", "Alain Doutey (Alain)", "Alix de Konopka (Clarisse)", "Carm\u00e9la Valente (Liouchka)", "Bertrand Lacy (Nicolas)", "Emmanuelle Oriheul (Perfume Saleswoman)", "Samuel Sogno (Maitre'd)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
