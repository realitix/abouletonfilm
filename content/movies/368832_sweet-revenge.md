His sister Kiriko makes the long trip to Tokyo, specifically to accost Otsuka, Japan's top criminal defence lawyer, and plead with him to take her brother's case. They live in Kitakyushu which, though a city, she contends that the local lawyers are not up to the job. Otsuka contemptuously brushes her off. A year passes. Masao has suicided in jail, his appeal having failed due to the lack of interest and competence of the local defence lawyer. Kiriko returns to Tokyo, planning revenge on Otsuka for refusing the case and causing her brother's death.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uX5ewAU8ng5odvcE4FM6880icb.jpg", "actors": ["Momoe Yamaguchi (Kiriko Yanagida)", "Tomokazu Miura (Keiichi Abe)", "Y\u00fbsuke Natsu (Kenji Sugiura)", "Renji Ishibashi (Takeo Yamagami)", "Yutaka Hayashi (Nishimura)", "Toru Wakasugi (Yamakawa)", "Mayuko Nishimura (Sanae Yashiro)", "Isao Tamagawa (Detective Oka)", "Sen Hara (Kiku Watanabe)", "Y\u00f4ko Machida (Madam of the Kaiso club)", "Miyuki Kojima (Nobuko Ehara)", "Tomiko Ishii (Madam of the Noa Noa bar)", "Masakazu Kuwayama (Keinosuke Okumura)", "Hiroshi Gojo ()", "Tatsuya Hamaguchi ()", "Takuto Anzai (Hisaoka)", "Hisayoshi Yamane ()", "Toshihiko Oda ()", "Ichiro Kijima ()", "Shigeru K\u00f4yama (Editor Tanimura)", "Ryunosuke Kaneda (Lawyer Hyodo)", "Masaya Takahashi (Prosecutor)", "Haruko Kato (Yoshiko Otsuka)", "Mizuho Suzuki ()", "Shin'ya Ohwada (Lawyer Shiratori)", "Hiroshi Sekiguchi (Masao Yanagida)", "Akiko Koyama (Michiko Kono)", "Rentar\u00f4 Mikuni (Kinzo Otsuka)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
