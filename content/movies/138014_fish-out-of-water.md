This feature documentary uses humor and original animation to make a traditionally complex and controversial topic accessible to those who don't like talking about religion and sexuality. Fish out of Water dives into the underbelly of America, crisscrosses red and blue states and talks to ministers from every denomination to uncover America's impassioned relationship with homosexuality and the Bible. With slapstick animation and quirky interviews taken everywhere from barbershops to mega churches, Fish out of Water delivers a voice to the oppressed and informs to the misled. Most importantly, Fish out of Water sits down with hundreds of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender folks to impart their experiences with faith and sexuality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vsegdliSNOCtcpMe7d1VRhuNPIH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
