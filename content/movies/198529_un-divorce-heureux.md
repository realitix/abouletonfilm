Ironically, the doctor's life is not a very happy one either, and his boast has a hollow sound. For one thing, although he seemingly has a \"happy divorce,\" in which he, his ex-wife and her new husband are all great pals, it's not true. He wants his wife back. All sorts of complications arise out of these lies and distortions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iPbUHEAqR9F104EO0P2EwtuZF2r.jpg", "actors": ["Jean Rochefort (Jean-Baptiste Morin, l\u00e6ge)", "Bulle Ogier (Marguerite, Morins tidligere kone)", "Andr\u00e9 Dussollier (Fran\u00e7ois Winter, journalist)", "Daniel Ceccaldi (Antoine, skuespiller)", "Anne-Lise Gabold (Sylvie)", "Etienne Bierry (Pierre)", "Bernadette Lafont (Jacqueline, klinikdame)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
