IRON PALM is certainly not your average South Korean movie. For one, it stars Koreans and the setting is Los Angeles, with no visits to the homeland at all. It's an appealing romantic comedy, highly predictable, but there's something to be said about a movie that doesn't make its leading lady completely sympathetic. All of the actors do a good job, and the movie is more funny than romantic, more lively than dull, and in a romantic comedy, that's really all one can hope for. Certainly not a bad film by any stretch. Worth a look for those who likes some quirk in their romantic comedies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sMkPvO7hfV14t9idplOayFUHvds.jpg", "actors": ["Cha In-pyo (Iron Palm)", "Kim Yoon-jin (Ji-ni)", "Park Kwang-Jung (Dong-seok)", "David Alan Graf (Detective #1)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [267413, 201319, 84657, 201317], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
