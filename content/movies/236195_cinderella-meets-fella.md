When the fairy godmother is late, Cinderella calls the police, who put out an APB and find her in a bar. Her first attempt at turning the pumpkin (canned) and mice into a coach produces Santa. Cinderella gets to the ball (in a stagecoach) and meets Prince Charming Egghead. They dance, and spend some quality time on the balcony. Midnight, dropped slipper, and all that; Egghead finds her house with the help of some neon signs, but all that's there is a note that she got tired of waiting and went to a Warner Bros. show. She pops up from the audience, and they head off to the tenth row together.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oUSB2TKc7PETbbVzGkpkiVGgaEt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
