Not just concerning the subject matter at hand, but also concerning itself. The Python-esque flick jumps from story to story embracing the language the Singaporean government would love its citizens to forget. Showcasing Singapore's ability to produce something of actual merit, Talking Cock doesn't just talk cock...it walks it too...if that makes any sense.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j0zWI1lq8prV6HuwZfZwR6VD8wa.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
