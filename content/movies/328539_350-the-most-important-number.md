A group of visionaries, scientists, farmers &amp; communities focus on solutions that can help create a healthier planet for all of us. This new progressive life style regenerates the soil, creates healthier food, builds communities, &amp; most importantly increases top soil. Top soil, the skin of the earth, &amp; where the life of the plant exists, is where our food comes from. According to many scientists, ranchers, &amp; environmentalists, by increasing the top soil, we can pull the extra CO2 in atmosphere back into soil &amp; fix the global climate change. But we all have to get involved and be a part of this solution.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
