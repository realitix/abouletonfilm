Though Elliot is billed first, the plot and action are evenly divided between the two B-picture favorites. The story takes place in Kansas, just after the Civil War. Wild Bill Hickok (Elliot) is summoned from Dodge City to Abilene, there to neutralize a crooked political machine. Hickok is aided every step of the way by Tex Rawlings (Ritter), a seemingly harmless drifter who is appointed sheriff after proving his prowess with his six-guns.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oGKEdmm4h8EeqWUlgCEEUsmJV6R.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Elliott (Wild Bill Hickok)", "Tex Ritter (Tex Rawlings)", "Judith Linden (Janice Blair)", "Dub Taylor (Cannonball Taylor)", "Guy Usher (Morgan King)", "Rick Anderson (Judge Lynch)", "Kenneth Harlan (Banker Carruthers)", "Pierce Lyden (Henchman Reynolds)", "Francis Walker (Henchman Carney)", "Harrison Greene (Stephen Kimball)", "Jack Rockwell (Martin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
