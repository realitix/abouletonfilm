However, the owner, instead of being happy about his now profitable business, insists to Charlie that something is fishy and that someone is out to murder him. Charlie and his \"crew\" travel to the mine, pretending to be tourists staying at a nearby dude ranch so as not to arouse suspicion, and discover that the owner may well be right--it looks like the mine is being used as a cover for criminal activities, and that someone is indeed out to murder him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eQqTcgIb3KCMGwapbPW7SOQFEUp.jpg", "actors": ["Roland Winters (Charlie Chan)", "Wanda McKay (Evelyn Manning)", "Mantan Moreland (Birmingham Brown)", "Victor Sen Yung (Tommy Chan (as Victor Sen Young))", "Bruce Kellogg (Talbot Bartlett)", "Tim Ryan (Vincent O'Brien / Lt.
