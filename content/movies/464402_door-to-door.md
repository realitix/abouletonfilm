The con artist/salesman Larry (Ron Leibman) meets Leon (Arliss Howard), an honest salesman who is making no money at all, and teaches him how to swindle his way to riches. The two team up, taking in everyone from car dealers to a poor widow, whose niece Katherine (Jane Kaczmarek) has sparked the interest of Leon. But since Larry himself is being blackmailed by a detective for the vacuum-cleaner company, his ultimate concern is getting rid of this drain on his hardly-earned money.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Ron Leibman (Larry Price)", "Arliss Howard (Leon Spencer)", "Jane Kaczmarek (Katharine Holloway)", "Ed Hawkins (Mansion Owner)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
