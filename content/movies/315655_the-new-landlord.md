After the wars of 1848, a retired Austrian army officer \"returns to the soil\" as a gentleman farmer in Hungary in the 1850s. The old campaigner is the father of two daughters: One of the girls comes to a sad end thanks to the malfeasances of a handsome spy, but the other has a happier fate when she falls in love with a Hungarian POW. The underlying theme is brotherhood, as the formerly warring Austrians and Hungarians at last find a common ground. Az Uj Foldesur was nearly twice as expensive as the average Hungarian film -- but at $40,000, its budget was a drop in the bucket compared to a typical Hollywood production.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Art\u00far Somlay (Ankerschmidt, lovag (as Somlay Arthur))", "M\u00e1ria Egry (El\u00edz, Anckersmih l\u00e1nya)", "Zita Gordon (Hermine, Anckerschmidt m\u00e1sik l\u00e1nya)", "Gyula Csortos (Garamv\u00f6lgyi \u00c1d\u00e1m)", "P\u00e1l J\u00e1vor (Garamv\u00f6lgyi Alad\u00e1r)", "K\u00e1lm\u00e1n R\u00f3zsahegyi (Kamp\u00f3s)", "M\u00e1ria L\u00e1z\u00e1r (Corinna)", "Tivadar Uray (Straff P\u00e9ter)", "Piri Pe\u00e9ry (Natalie)", "Ger\u0151 M\u00e1ly (Dr.Gris\u00e1k, \u00fcgyv\u00e9d)", "Ger\u0151 M\u00e1ly (Dr. Gris\u00e1k, \u00fcgyv\u00e9d)", "Zolt\u00e1n Makl\u00e1ry (Maxenpfutsch)", "Gy\u00f6rgy K\u00fcrthy (Br\u00e4nh\u00e4nsel)", "Gyula Justh (Mikucsek (as Juszt Gyula))", "Tivadar Bilicsi (Georg)", "Ede Hilbert (Gyuszi (as ifj.
