Looking at surf music, industry development and the historical context of the era with the biting wit writer and surf journo Phil Jarratt is known for, the film is a lively and fun look back at an era that now feels almost mystical.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oZAkdLGxIBsWsdWPsyjbPnXRyoE.jpg", "actors": ["Barry Bennett (Himself)", "Scott Dillon (Himself)", "Danny Keogh (Himself)", "Bill Wallace (Himself)", "Gordon Woods (Himself)", "Greg McDonagh (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "FRYFiNFnVmQ"}
