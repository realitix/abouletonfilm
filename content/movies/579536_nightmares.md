S\u0142awomir Sierakowski (leader of the Polish leftist group and magazine \u201cKrytyka Polityczna\u201d) acts here as an activist who passionately invites Jews to come back to Poland. The derelict Tenth Anniversary Stadium in Warsaw provides the scenery of his passionate speech: \u201cJews! Fellow countrymen! People! Peeeeople! This is a call, not to the dead, but to the living. We want 3 million Jews to return to Poland, to live with us again. We need you! We\u2019re asking you to return!\u201d Bartana relates here to the timeless aesthetics of propaganda films, e.g. Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s Triumph of the Will from 1934 (where the stadium also becomes an scene of political manipulation), but also the earlier Zionist film chronicles targeted at Jews settling down on the Palestinian territories.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
