Based on a chapter of author Shi Naian's The Water Margin (AKA: Outlaws of the Marsh), the action kicks off when Liu Yuen Ying (Ding Nung) is \"bride-napped\" by a bandit who's out to make her his wife! The bandit's sympathetic sister returns Ying, but that's only the beginning of the mistaken identities, social satires, and cross-dressing confusion as Ying's disappearance and return wreaks havoc with the locals! A delightful costume comedy that combines screwball antics, musical interludes, and even a little action, The Bride Napping is a fun and entertaining way to catch the legendary Lok Dai at her most beautiful and charming!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q9LVjn3dDzs6LHTuG7HzeJqNEjR.jpg", "actors": ["Betty Loh Tih (Chun Lan)", "Ding Ling (Liu Yuet-Ying)", "Kiu Chong (Pien Chi)", "Diana Chang Chung-Wen (Chou Yu-Lu)", "Chu Mu (Chou Tung)", "Chan Yau-San (Squire Liu Teh-Ming)", "Ma Hsiao-Nung (Squire's wife)", "Ku Wen-Chung (Liu Fu)", "Tien Feng (Tiger General Li Chung)", "Fung Ngai (Monk Lo Chi-Hsin/Lo Teh)", "Gam Tin-Chue (Wedding guest)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
