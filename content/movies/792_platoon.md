The film that put Stone on the map, Platoon is considered by Vietnam Vets as the most realistic. But in keeping the maxim of giving credit where credit is due, much of the success of Platoon belongs to military adviser Captain Dale Dye, who has been linked to pretty much every great war movie in the last twenty years. Much accolades to Tom Berenger as well, whose performance as Sgt. Barnes is the tour de force of his career. With a great script, great performances, and awesome cinematography, Platoon is a surefire classic."}], "recommandations_id": [33, 11778, 28, 826]}
