During the early 1950's the very existence of this camp for political prisoners at Recsk was one of the Hungarian communist regime's deepest secrets. Hundreds of people were taken there without ever actually being sentenced by any court, and had to suffer through the brutal treatment handed down by their sadistic captors. This documentary tells the story of Recsk from both the captors' and the prisoners' point of view, capturing the atmosphere of paranoia, humiliation and degradation that prevailed throughout the Stalinist gulag system.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k4iXAZGmSEvkIceNOxZuMJL6lQG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
