But that's not just because of Benno, but because no one really has time for him. During a train ride, he meets a pensioner Oskar Schrader (Erwin Geschonneck), who likes to cook, collect watches, master magic tricks and who lives in the middle of nature. Between them they develop a real friendship. Benno is allowed to spend his school holidays with his friend. The grumpy Oskar lives alone in a garden colony - with friendly and unfriendly neighbors. Benno enjoys playing tricks with his buddy Mutz (Thomas Hoffer) on this neighborhood including the cranky animal lover Irma Kalweit (Agnes Krause) and the rude daredevil Ralf Klotz (Henry H\u00fcbchen).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fvZGEf1VXm1Mc0pEliU714LwWbc.jpg", "actors": ["Erwin Geschonneck (Oskar Schrader)", "Agnes Kraus (Irma Kalweit)", "Henry H\u00fcbchen (Ralf Klotz)", "Renate Blume (Renate Pfeffer)", "Janina Hartwig (Martina Klein)", "Walfriede Schmitt (Vera Fr\u00f6seke)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
