A family: Ana, the mother, Katarina, Tvrtko and Drazen, her three grown up children, and Tvrtko's girlfriend Natasa. The story begins in the morning when Natasa, after a quarrel with her boyfriend, comes back home, a two-bedroom apartment where her mother and brothers live. This brings a little bit of confusion in the family's everyday schedule.
