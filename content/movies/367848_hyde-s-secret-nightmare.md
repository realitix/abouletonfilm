Cross-cut erotic and horror scenes are kept together by a thread of dramatic force bordering on obsession, paranoia, phobia, perversion, and lack of self-acceptance. Everything unfolds in an extreme world where sex seems the only way to attain a state of well-being.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3VOkhcoEJaQSZ8VCLgir6Y7aaPp.jpg", "actors": ["Roberta Gemma ()", "Nancy de Lucia (Fantasma)", "Angelo Campus (The Devil)", "Andrea Autullo (Abdul alhazred)", "Yuri Antonosante (Priest)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "qdqI9VUNL6w"}
