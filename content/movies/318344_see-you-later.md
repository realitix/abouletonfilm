But what took a mere 30 seconds in \u2018real\u2019 time had been recorded with a Super Slo-Mo video camera (developed for sports broadcasting) and further processed before the final transfer to film, being expanded to a full 18 minutes. With the continuous right-to-left pan in smooth and constant motion, taken from a fixed tripod position, the whole image- with arriving and departing frame details- is fully equal in interest and importance to the \u2018event\u2019 depicted.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8KoDJbtsdUkMPLDmFa9gM5yWJyO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
