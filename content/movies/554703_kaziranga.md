We see this world through the eyes of Uttam Saikia, a local journalist who is trying to use his community influence to reform poachers.  Kaziranga\u2019 is a powerful portrayal of how human empathy is an effective strategy for reforming rhino poachers. It shows us how a single person\u2019s compassion and actions can help break the cycles of violence that ensnare our most majestic wildlife and a region\u2019s most economically vulnerable people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mDrl2Hbtkisbt4dFNmlWOoDCUxV.jpg", "actors": ["Uttam Saikia (Uttam Saikia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "uL34zOXkmOc"}
