After school he likes to hang out in the park with his friends, listen to music, game with his best friend Stefan and go to the dance school as often as possible. His favourite dance partner is Roxanne. No one, especially Roxanne, can know that Maarten is chronically ill. He has a serious metabolic disease and is not likely to grow old.
