There is priceless footage of Neal Cassady driving Ken Kesey's bus and of the Dead, surrounded by martini-sipping hipsters, on Playboy After Dark. The best scenes involve band members talking about specific songs (you will never hear Phil Lesh's \"Box of Rain\" again without thinking of it as a gift to his dying father) or deconstructing a tune by playing each track separately. Intimate and surprisingly cohesive, Anthem to Beauty is a rare glimpse into how the Dead's magic was made.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uVv3Jhh2rdtvWUkAQ06y62uz5hv.jpg", "actors": ["Jerry Garcia (Himself)", "Bob Weir (Himself)", "Phil Lesh (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
