{"tmdb_id": 137651, "title": "Kings Point", "original_title": "Kings Point", "slug_title": "kings-point", "date": "2012-01-01", "genre": [""], "score": "6.5/10", "synopsis": "In the 1970s and 80s, hundreds of thousands of senior citizens migrated from New York City to Kings Point, a typical retirement community, located just outside West Palm Beach, Florida. Lured by blue skies, sunshine, palm trees, and the promise of a rich social life, they bought their way to paradise for just a $1,500 down payment. Now, as an aging community faces its own mortality, paradise has begun to exact a higher price. Through the experiences of six longtime residents, 'Kings Point' captures both the allure and the darker complexities of living in a world where 'nobody gets too close.' Poignant, funny and dark, 'Kings Point' is a deeply empathetic portrait of the last act of the American Dream.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g2WqooRzFNuA3tRuTG5hhKRoVOv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
