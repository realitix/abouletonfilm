In the old Russian city of Novgorod, the merchants are feasting in a gorgeous palace and Sadko is bragging that he can bring to their land a sweet-voiced bird of happiness. They laugh at him, but he is offered help by the Ocean King's daughter, who is mesmerized by Sadko's singing and is in love with him. The hero is destined to visit many lands in his search of the bird.  First shown in the USA in 1953 with English subtitles, the film was re-released in the United States in 1962 in an English-dubbed and modified, but remarkably unedited,  form by Roger Corman's Filmgroup under the title The Magic Voyage of Sinbad.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/20wv48sHdHM0YUvNiKvIPq84CoE.jpg", "actors": ["Sergei Stolyarov (Sadko [Sinbad in dubbed version])", "Alla Larionova (Lyubava)", "Ninel Myshkova (Princess of Lake Ilmen)", "B.
