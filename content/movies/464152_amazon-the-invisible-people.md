In Ecuador, an uncontacted tribe called the Tageari are next in the firing line and when contact occurs, their health, their faith, their environment, their love - all the things that define their culture - are changed forever. AMAZON - THE INVISIBLE PEOPLE traces the work of an Australian, Doug Ferguson, who went to Ecuador in 1986 to work with Indigenous people. He married a shaman's daughter, fathered two children and built a rainforest home. Doug has helped three tribes secure and demark their ancestoral land, saved more than a million hectares of pristine rainforest in reserves and National Parks, and established sustainable agricultural projects in a nation devastated by slash and burn agriculture. This is the story of Doug Ferguson's work.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bDWZluZD3BQUz1nRGe8nOK2GXo7.jpg", "actors": ["Douglas Ferguson (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
