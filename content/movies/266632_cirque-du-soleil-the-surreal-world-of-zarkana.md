It began as a touring show in 2011 and was converted to a permanent show in Las Vegas in late 2012. It premiered at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on June 29, 2011 and later toured to the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow and the Madrid Arena in Madrid.  Following Zarkana's successful run in Moscow, it was announced that the show would start residency at the Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. The show replaced the Cirque du Soleil resident production Viva Elvis, which closed in August 2012 at the Aria Resort.  Zarkana by Cirque du Soleil is about a spirited journey through an abandoned theater where an extraordinary circus comes back to life. Populated by a motley collection of off-the-wall characters and incomparable acrobats, Zarkana is a visual vortex set in a twisted acrobatic fantasy universe where, little by little, chaos and craziness give way to a true celebration.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tAx9Ejqx321sb0lqGcbInZa8NL2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
