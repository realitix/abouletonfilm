The film maker chased it for over two years to capture the magical interaction between the soft mist, the ridges of the California coast and the iconic Golden Gate Bridge. The film showcases a unique way of looking at the movement of fog, which is usually hidden in time. Simon Christen lifts us above that thick cold blanket to reveal a beautiful ocean that crests, flows and ebbs. Only the highest points of the city and it's bridges can peek through, becoming adrift, while the rest is caressed by this natural beauty.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gf44RStxobZo0aIqo4iWhFnPkGC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
