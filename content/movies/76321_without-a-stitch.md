She does just that and soon finds herself caught up in a sexual merry-go-round that includes making a hardcore porno film in Sweden, an escapade with a German sadist and a lesbian encounter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fferyxkYklChekrsmSOxHFz7bEc.jpg", "actors": ["Anne Grete Nissen (Lillian - the teenager)", "Ib Mossin (Dr. Petersen - Lilian's gynecologist)", "S\u00f8ren Str\u00f8mberg (Grev Jan)", "John Martinus (Jon)", "\u00c5ke Engfeldt (Bengt - the makeup artist)", "Joan Gamst (Lise)", "Niels Dybeck (G\u00f6ran)", "Ann Bennett (German mud wrestler)", "Helena Germann (German mud wrestler)", "Ki-Jo Feza (Britta)", "Dieter Eppler (Kurt von Asbach)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "DrMarty", "content": "A young Scandinavian woman (Ana-Grete Nissen) is concerned that she is frigid, so she consults a young male doctor who prescribes a highly unorthodox and unprofessional(but pretty predictable) solution to her problem. After his \"hands-on\" approach brings her some definite sexual satisfaction, he recommends that she continue her \"explorations\" by taking a long road trip where, naturally, she is to have sex with all, um, comers that she meets along the way. This leads to straight sex scenes, lesbian sex scenes, three-way sex scenes, and at least one hilarious S-and-M sex scene. These sex scenes are ridiculously numerous, but they are also quite fast-paced, making this movie a little more exciting than most tedious softcore grinders. Like a lot of 70's Swedish actresses, Nissen is quite appealing simply because she looks like a normal girl rather than the well-worn Times Square skanks you tend to find in a lot of American softcore films of that era (and she's obviously more girl than silicone, unlike pretty much all the \"adult\" actresses of today)."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
