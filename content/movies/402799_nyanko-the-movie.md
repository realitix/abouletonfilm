But something odd that I noticed while in Japan, while they love their cats as much as the rest of the world, they seem to think mangy cats with giant un-neatured balls hanging down underneath their lack of tails are cute. So spliced amongst the cute cats are scenes of rugged strays chowing down on fish scraps thrown by fishermen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qRrFuIm4pigJUQ9gROJXCu8qrU1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
