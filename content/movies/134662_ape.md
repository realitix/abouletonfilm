Not only does he bomb on stage, but he bombs in everyday life. He\u2019s fed up with all the jerks who push him around. All he wants is a break, and for someone to get him. Instead of taking a breath and getting himself together or taking his anger to the stage, he turns to the loud din of his headphones and the crackling glow of fire to ease his mind. He\u2019s not only a lousy comic, but a pyromaniac, as well.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xAtFrO8eb7PNckVALY7RxhHBjQp.jpg", "actors": ["Joshua Burge (Trevor Newandyke)", "Gary Bosek (Dennis Spicer)", "Daniel Falicki (The Devil)", "Nick Fairbanks (Bathroom heckler)", "Gary Perrine (Cisco)", "Teri Ann Nelson (Barb)", "Ahmed Madey (Headphones kid)", "Benjamin Riley (7-11 Bum)", "Victoria Mullen (7-11 Woman)", "Kevin Clancy (Tim)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
