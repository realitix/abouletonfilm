A life that consists of rock concerts, hut trips, amusement park visits and car thefts. The year is 1958, when the Americans launched the Explorer and the Russians Sputnik III. However, these events do not interest the youthful persons in this film, the members of the \"Sinsen gang\". For them, it is far more important to know which rock hits are on top on Top Twenty on Radio Luxembourg, and to have seen the latest film with Elvis. The most important is to be accepted by the gang, to be loyal to your pals, and for a very few to be prepared for school", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lmiIxautZr1eZOM5ODDATLEbAkR.jpg", "actors": ["Rune Dybedahl (Arne)", "Cecilie Holter (Beate)", "Tone Christine Senstad ()", "Margot Alfstad (Inger-Lise)", "\u00d8yvind Janeschitz (Knut)", "Anders Volle (Morten)", "Steinar Raaen ()", "Roar Wester\u00e5s ()", "Lars Espen Bakke ()", "Jappa Calmeyer ()", "Mona J\u00e6ger ()", "Randi Rommetveit ()", "Eldar V\u00e5gan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
