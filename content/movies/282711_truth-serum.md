The completed film (that is missing its original soundtrack) provides a unique glimpse into his life and friends at the time including fellow filmmakers Nathaniel Dorsky and Jerome Hiller. Dorsky was a close friend of Sonbert who appears in several of his films and similar imagery courses through both filmmakers\u2019 works. But whereas Sonbert accelerated the pacing of his montage, Dorsky extended the pacing of his shots, allowing a more lingering contemplation of his images. Sonbert wrote of Dorsky\u2019s Hours for Jerome that it was \u2018simply the most beautifully photographed film that I\u2019ve ever seen\u2026 Here cinema enters the realm of the compassionate; capturing the eye and the mind in ways unlike the predictable arena of structural film.\u2019", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
