Though she was sold to a geisha house at a young age, Aihara (Yoshinaga) has since become a master samisen player and woman of great elegance. Though not especially rich, she doles out money to street kids, in particular, a pretty young flower vendor named Oyuki, who becomes Aihara's godchild of sorts. Yet when a geisha (Reiko Takashima) from a rival red-light district insults Aihara and her brethren, she fights back. Soon an all-out geisha war looms. Dapper businessman and amateur scholar Tojiro Koga (Tetsuya Watari) appears on the scene and defuses tempers -- suggesting that difference be settled through a competition of artistic abilities. Smitten with her talent and mature beauty, Koga invites Aihara to record Nagasaki folk songs before they disappear forever", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9yeFFuA4hcWLCq7egBX3FCbuV2t.jpg", "actors": ["Sayuri Yoshinaga (Aihachi)", "Tetsuya Watari ()", "Reiko Takashima ()", "Shiho Fujimura ()", "Ayumi Ishida ()", "Tomoyo Harada ()", "Murasaki Onoue ()", "Kaori Takahashi ()", "Tatsuo Matsumura ()", "Ittoku Kishibe ()", "Toshiyuki Nagashima ()", "Hiroshi Katsuno ()", "Keiko Utsumi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
