Erotomania is a type of schizophrenia where the sufferer can\u2019t distinguish between real life and one\u2019s own imagination life. One day my grandma suddenly said, \u201dI had someone I truly loved when I was young and he is looking for me to pick me up\u201d The next day, she started riding a taxi for few hours trying to find him. ... No one knows if my grandmother\u2019s true love exists or not. ... At the same time as my grandmother I was also on a search. I was looking for angels. My interest in angels started when I discovered Paul Klee\u2019s Angel Drowning series. This series had a profound effect on me. Within the same week my friend took me to a Walter Benjamin lecture where they discussed his angel theories. It was synchronicity. My grandmother and I were both searching for something, something that no one knew existed or not.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xvn2xGzhoDtn5aB5vs5K7z6LaIh.jpg", "actors": ["Sac ()", "Hisako Fukuda ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
