This is a poignant display of the human mind desperately grasping for normalcy while having been \"trained\" otherwise at an early age. While Laura's mother is in the hospital for a long stay her father terrorizes Laura. Sex then is the next step and before Laura's mother comes home her father makes her promise not to tell her mother what he has been doing to her. Laura's reality is now well tainted as she oscillates repeatedly between what is real versus what she thinks is real in the actions of both men and women towards her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uYcJlhRyf2kRrwu9W6k2wX8QnQY.jpg", "actors": ["Doreen Ross (Laura Zuckerman)", "David Ariniello ()", "Gertrude Clement ()", "Gary Faulkner ()", "Tina Faulkner ()", "Roxanne Holland ()", "Terry Logan ()", "Chiah Tuck ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
