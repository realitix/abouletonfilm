Tale-telling to some children is the realization of creative instincts, to others the performance of self, or it's simply a tedious pedagogic vessel. My research-creation completes with adult women transforming the usage of Cinderella-objects into agents of their own stories, however fragmentary or elliptical. The event of tale-telling woke up the child in them; children language was appropriated to perform unarticulated subjectivities. Gender is a complex system, most revealing in language-in-action. The coda is a grand finale celebrating the magical power of objects and their own unlimited lives. Story-telling is the most primitive form of play. Harmless it may look, it is also the most sophisticated embodiment of ideological workings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fOxswxeaGkhpmfqbvw74kCmKEIP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
