The 1968 documentary captures Bootstrap\u2019s mission of economic development with scenes of women and men training for a range of employment opportunities including how to operate power sewing machines for work in the local garment factory, to the new technologies of the day, the IBM keypunch machines. Especially engaging are the scenes of \u201csensitivity sessions\u201d hosted by the organization, where black and white Angelenos debate issues of race and racism in 1960s America. The film\u2019s cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style allows for a certain closeness with its subject and allows for a precious time capsule glimpse into this vibrant and struggling community.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Robert Hall (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
