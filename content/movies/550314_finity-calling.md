Only windows, no doors. It\u2019s empty except for five people sitting at a table that seats six. Their withered bodies adorned with lush fabrics and jewelry, they spend eternity playing with their food. A charged silence fills the air. Any violation of the strict social rules is immediately suppressed by the others. When the fragile equilibrium in the group is finally broken by the boy\u2019s constant pestering, things start spiraling out of control. His mother tries her best to protect both him and herself from the consequences but playing this double role comes at a high price.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sclcKy7XftUiqSY3Dj1P1M6g8uY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
