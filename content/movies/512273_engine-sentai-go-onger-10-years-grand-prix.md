But because of this, it severed the connections between the Go-Ongers and the Engines. Plus, due to the Sentai Activity Ban Law, the Go-Ongers are labelled as terrorists! Amidst that, a mysterious young boy named Souji appears to them with BeaRV's Engine Cast. Sosuke / Go-On Red and the rest save him as he was being pursued by the special police. For some reason, one standing in their way is Saki / Go-On Yellow, who parted ways with the Go-Ongers and has become part of the governments public relations office.
