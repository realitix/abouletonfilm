Funny Up North tells the story of the Mancunian Studios, its eccentric owner John E Blakeley and its cavalcade of stars including such household names as Arthur Askey, Jimmy Jewell, George Formby and the legendary Frank Randle. Hosted by Professor Chris Lee, the authority on northern cinema, Funny Up North takes you on a journey from its humble beginnings to its sad demise in the 1960s.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gtPhqVwn2DA6EEI9W9SsjtFWFqy.jpg", "actors": ["Frank Randle (Pvt.
