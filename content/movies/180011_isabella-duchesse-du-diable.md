Anyway, yes plenty of sword fights, pretty well done, rather a lot of talking, not so well done and a great lead performance from a plucky Brigitte Skay who wins most of the sword fights and bares just enough skin to keep us interested through some of the lesser moments. A lot of people dressed as soldiers chasing each other about but one or two quite extraordinary scenes including, the seduction of a near naked black slave who is to be whipped if he shows signs of excitement, as an extra at a banquet and an amazing scene where our heroine gets a mighty lashing, facing the camera."}], "recommandations_id": [40528]}
