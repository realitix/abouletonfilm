Determined to overcome his fear, he resolved to cross the Sahara Desert by camel, training for years to prepare himself for the emotional and physical ordeal. Cole filmed his travels from Mauritania to the Sudan with a 16mm Bolex, capturing the harsh reality of the desert environment with an unflinching intimacy.
