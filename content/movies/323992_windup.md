Windup is a very original comedy. We follow Bernie Shaddick from his tragic childhood, through to his present day pursuit of a career as an inventor. Likened to such films as \"Raising Arizona\" and \"The Big Lebowski\", gritty cohen-esque humor saturates Bernie Shaddick's life, from his encounter with mace at a potential sale, to his murderous mentors posing as his Aunt Audre and Uncle Reg. Bernie is a man who, in the face of rejection and ridicule, just \"doesn't get it\", and perseveres anyways", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
