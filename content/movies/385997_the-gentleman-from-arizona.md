Farrell McDonald, cast as a chronic gambler named Coburn. When the old man loses every penny he has, wandering cowboy Pokey (King) comes to the rescue by grooming a wild stallion for a successful racetrack career. Everything comes to a head during the climactic Big Race, with the expected (but still satisyfing) results. Ruth Reece and Joan Barclay share the leading-lady responsibilities, while the villainy is in the capable hands of Monogram's ace utility actor Craig Reynolds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/upawLRasotBr9BGSa9ct8lPfZad.jpg", "actors": ["John 'Dusty' King (Pokey Sanders (as John King))", "J.
