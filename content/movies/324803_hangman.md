The stalker we only see from time to time and he's weird I guess, which makes sense.\r\n\r\nI just looked at the credits and saw that Amy Smart was in it which surprised me, she was in it in retrospect but you couldn't really see it was here because she was only in one scene sitting by a table with the \"hidden camera\" being very far away.\r\n\r\nSo yeah if she is what makes you want to watch this don't bother. But then there is no real reason to bother watching this period."}], "recommandations_id": [323366, 315899, 66111, 260163], "youtube_key": "5Jb9sMjp4gU"}
