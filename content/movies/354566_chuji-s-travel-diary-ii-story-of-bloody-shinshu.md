It was originally released in three parts, all of which were long thought to be lost until portions of the second part and much of the third part were discovered and restored in 1991. Since the film had once been voted in a 1959 Kinema Junp\u014d poll as the best Japanese film of all time, its discovery was significant. At the time of its release, It\u014d was the leader of a new style of samurai films that featured outlaw heroes and fast-cut sword fighting scenes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v8zTNsrFqeGh0XVyGIzKTiCS5eJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
