Using the stained tongue as a tool and stamping pad, the first impression is made 40 frames (1 foot) into the film and then reduced by one frame with each new stamp, accelerating until the marks overlap. Mechanistic control is then rejected in favour of spitting and dribbling as random action, painterly like splats and dense swirling tangles roll along the filmstrip and spill into the audio track, generating noisy rasps and skidding sounds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hkUmdFMUtpz7skLUnvIGPHMVIDr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
