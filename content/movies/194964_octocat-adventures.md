The videos featured crude MS Paint animation and a loud, highpitched, childlike voice narrating. On September 7, the fifth, final episode was released, but featured an unexpected twist - about 20 seconds into it, the crude sketchy animation switched to intricately crafted 3D with an orchestral soundtrack; the whole Octocat story (and as such, the Randy Peters persona) was revealed to be by David O'Reilly.[8] In an interview he said \"I wanted to try experimenting with the Youtube audience and Microsoft Paint. The story for Octocat came to me by reading the bible word-for-word backwards\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ohosao5mxg9KIEj47urYfR9KMWH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
