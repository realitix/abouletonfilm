While getting back on their feet, the family stays with their eccentric Aunt Norah and tries to adjust to a new life. They meet a quirky neighborhood kid, Pete, who convinces them to embark on a \"bucket-list\" type adventure inspired by a list found in their Dad's high school storage boxes. The task is not as easy as it seems and ultimately teaches everyone about managing grief, moving forward, and the importance of family.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pSFMKYsHuETmZyiQbBFyE0cOalH.jpg", "actors": ["Landon Kasten (Dylan Foster)", "Roni D.
