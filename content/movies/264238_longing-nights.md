Aitana is a sweet girl trapped in a men\u2019s body; Pierrick is a cute French gay; Rita doesn't much care about her partner, Carolina, and walks through life with no expectations; Jorge is trapped in a relationship with no future: the one he has with Maria.  Set against a background of drugs, sex, multiple partners and differing sexualities, Longing Nights follows the individual stories of these young people.  A candid portrait of four relationships highly loaded with eroticism from beginning to end. Four stories told without no borders between fiction and reality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iXvlTMmh7cMneUQAo6cOMZpZfog.jpg", "actors": ["Aviador Deluxe ()", "Ainhoa Azcona ()", "Shota Buadze ()", "Mar\u00eda Flores ()", "Pierrick Fouilleux ()", "Leire Igartua ()", "Rita Macedo ()", "Jorge Mart\u00edn ()", "Dami\u00e1n Mengoni ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
