From now on dreaming is forbidden in his realm, and art and culture have to suffer as well. Then the dreamers revolt. Animation based on a story by Belcampo from 1934 offers rudimentary animation, combined with stock footage and film clips. The result is a rich and playful film, with a lot of affection for imagination.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pJUr3bdfKUmutGkhDFw2Uj7s1HC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
