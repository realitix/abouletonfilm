He is joined by Ferm\u00edn Morales, a teenage boy who admires Ignacio and wishes to become a juglar like him. Carrillo reluctantly accepts, given his loneliness. On Ash Wednesday 1968, Carrillo, Morales and their donkey start a journey throughout several towns in the Caribbean region in Northern Colombia, until Taroa (a small caser\u00edo in Uribia jurisdiction), in La Guajira desert, where Carrillo's maestro supposedly lives. During their journey, Carrillo participates in the first version of the Vallenato Legend Festival in Valledupar.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lVJF51zXe5jDUtrtPz6Z4nKHOhG.jpg", "actors": ["Marciano Mart\u00ednez (Ignacio Carrillo)", "Yull N\u00fa\u00f1ez (Fermin Morales)", "Agustin Nieves (Ninz)", "Jose Luis Torres (Meyo)", "Carmen Molina (Tendera)", "Erminia Martinez (Mujer Guajira)", "Justo Valdez (Batata)", "Juan Batista Martinez (Marimbero Mayor)", "Hector Brito (Alvaro Figueras)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [209835, 49256, 242928, 338942], "youtube_key": "6M5bQ3CmWGI"}
