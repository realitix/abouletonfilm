The movie tells the story about a group of high school teens who steal a van full of music equipment and pretend to be a band, called \"Truckstop\" (played by the band, Rodan) in order to stay on the road. When the band starts playing gigs, their sound is largely inconsistent and incoherent, however, over time, the band becomes increasingly competent in their musicianship. The film puts much emphasis on the indie/alternative rock subculture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pVFIOJ7skzrQV8wpDfXM5WxAzlO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
