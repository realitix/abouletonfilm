Going beyond those who hit the links a lot or follow the PGA tour religiously, this film tells tales of the truly obsessed. Meet a man who treats one of Arnold Palmer's divots as a pet and a woman who divorced her husband to court a lower-handicapped golfer, as well as the fanatic who, in one day alone, played courses in London, New York and Los Angeles.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
