The fight only took one day, with the Genji suffering utter defeat which led to their exile. His father, Yoshitomo, took responsibility for the loss and rather than live in humiliation, he decides to commit suicide with all his sons following him. However, the bravest warrior among them, Yoritomo stands tall and declares that he will not kill himself, but rather will fight to restore the clan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e0ctNi7HR2RK5544DizJXkw3FkP.jpg", "actors": ["Hashizo Okawa ()", "Yoshiko Mita ()", "Ry\u00fbnosuke Tsukigata ()", "Masuo Kamiki ()", "Kunio Kaga ()", "Sonosuke Sawamura ()", "Mikijiro Hira ()", "Haruo Tanaka ()", "Hiroko Sakuramachi ()", "Masao Mishima ()", "Eiji Okada ()", "Denjir\u00f4 \u00d4k\u00f4chi ()", "Sh\u00f4ji Yasui ()", "Kusuo Abe ()", "Tokinosuke Nakamura ()", "Kinjir\u00f4 Tooyama ()", "Otabe Michimaro ()", "Eijir\u00f4 Kataoka ()", "Kinji Nakamura ()", "Shinnosuke Ogata ()", "Shin Tokudaiji ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
