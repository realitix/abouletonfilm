She is sad, not because she has to leave her mother and sister, with whom everything is clear and sometimes difficult, but because she is having a serious love affair with someone from her village to whom she is very committed: a young upper-middle class man who seems to sincerely feel the same. They promise that nothing will change between them. It is only until June and then she can ask for a transfer. And so she leaves, a little sad and a little curious about what is in store for her. But what she finds is completely different from what she imagined.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4oVZYsqJRcPUXuC9Y9GQpuM9uLU.jpg", "actors": ["Isabella Ragonese (Nena)", "Alberto Boll (Francesco)", "Francesco Chiarello (Giovanni)", "Miriana Protopapa (Sorella di Nena)", "Rita Schirinzi (Madre di Nena)", "Vigea Bechis Boll (Cristiana)", "Bianca Maria Stea Lindholm (Donna Carla)", "Antonio Fumarola (Domenico)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
