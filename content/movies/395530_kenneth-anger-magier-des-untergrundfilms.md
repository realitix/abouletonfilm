In fact, he reveals that he goes so far as to use astrology when making these choices.  This is as direct an explanation of Anger\u2019s cinemagical modus operandi as I have ever heard him articulate anywhere. It\u2019s a must see for anyone interested in his work and showcases the Magus of cinema at the very height of his artistic powers. Fascinating.
