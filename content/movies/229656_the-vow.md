Clemens von Brentano, an artist in his prime, visits the nun\u2032s sickbed as a simple \"writer of the wonders of God\" to take down her visions and beliefs. He believes himself to be in charge of his life as a devout Catholic. The former rake\u2032s encounter with the charismatic nun proves fateful, however.
