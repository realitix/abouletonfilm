Over the next 18 years, she is taught how to kill but before being placed into the field, Lomax dies.  Alex hits the streets, socially naive but with exceptional physical capabilities. The Intel organization decides to cut its losses and dispatches assets to terminate Alex. She harshly deals with them forcing the company to reassess.  Elite instructor Lester Casey tricks Alex into surrendering herself and through a series of brutal retraining methods, breaks her down making her compliant, but the spark of moral right that Lomax lit in her as a young girl, still flickers.
