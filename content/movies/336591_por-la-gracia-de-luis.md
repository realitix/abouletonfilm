Anything can happen. Their actors don't intervene, but their characters. There are no interviews, but greetings; a mosaic of entrances and exits. It is an invitation to the spectators, a Berlanguiana, an anthology, an allegorical religious play, a verbena.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6fiLyXPLy0nd1hWdDRUSgiCXCFf.jpg", "actors": ["Luis Garc\u00eda Berlanga (Himself)", "\u00c1ngel S\u00e1nchez Harguindey (Himself)", "Agust\u00edn Tena (Himself)", "Antonio G\u00f3mez Rufo (Himself)", "Fernando M\u00e9ndez-Leite (Himself)", "Francisco Canet (Himself)", "Jes\u00fas Franco (Himself)", "John Hopewell (Himself)", "Jorge Berlanga (Himself)", "Jos\u00e9 Luis Borau (Himself)", "Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Guzm\u00e1n (Himself)", "Manuel Guti\u00e9rrez Arag\u00f3n (Himself)", "Manuel Vicent (Himself)", "Tacho de la Calle (Himself)", "V\u00edctor Garc\u00eda Le\u00f3n (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
