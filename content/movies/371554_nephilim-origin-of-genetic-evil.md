The cinematography is nonexistent. It's really worse than that. The narrator, Trey Smith, who is also the writer, director, and everything else, is about six inches from the camera, covering the entire right-hand side of the screen. The other half is a semi-random set of images and short videos. The narrator's voice is extremely nasally.\r\n\r\nUltimately, it's probably more 'information' than old-school History Channel documentaries, but the quality of what is shown is way lower than those. The theories he talks about are somewhat interesting, but I do feel that the video could be half as long and get the same point across."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
