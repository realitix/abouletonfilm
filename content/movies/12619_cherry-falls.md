The modus operandi appears to be only virgins are being selected.\r\n\r\nCompromised in production, Cherry Falls, while not exactly pushing itself forward as a top line slasher, still shows some devil may care attitude and cheeky propositions. Flipping the standard formula of teens having sex then getting murdered on its head, the screenplay instead has the kids needing to have sex to stay alive! The script has some absolute zingers in it, so keep your ears open, and a solid cast headed by Michael Biehn, Jay Mohr and an adorable Brittany Murphy keep tongue in cheeks as the blood does flow. You wont be taxed to work out who the killer is, and come the final quarter as the flashbacks reveal all, death in Cherry Falls loses its impact. But still there's enough teenager stalk death fun to keep it watchable. 6/10"}], "recommandations_id": [16077, 14033, 12212, 10984]}
