Spotting a theatrical poster for Mademoiselle Kitty, he feels his passion surge and consults a fortuneteller for advice. \u201cYou are in love,\u201d the cat is told and should pop the question at once. At the theater, the cat endures several acts (surely not players on the Keith-Albee Theatre circuit!), but makes little headway with Kitty, who leaves after the show with a top-hatted dog. When Kitty\u2019s date proves to be a robber, our hero saves the day and returns with his ladylove to her home\u2014and her brood of kittens. Tomcat makes a quick exit. As we are reminded in the final title card, \u201c2600 Years Ago Aesop Said 'Anticipation is greater than realization.' \u201d", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
