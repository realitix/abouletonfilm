One of the film\u2019s best features is the fact that there\u2019s quite an original and intriguing storyline here that answers a rather important question not many really have answered. One of the more believable aspects here is that this one explores the idea of a tormented and traumatized survivor which makes for a really interesting storyline about her abilities to cope with the situation and how it has now impacted her life, an idea that really needed exploring and features some rather novel ideas about what happens afterward. Her paranoia and delusions about what\u2019s happened manifests in not only the extreme isolation in her life but also plenty of rather nice freak-outs about whether or not he\u2019s really come back including the scenes of her at the laundromat or hanging out with them at the bar when he appears to her which all showcase the  extreme lengths she\u2019s fallen to in her current state. Aside from this, there\u2019s still plenty to enjoy here with the film\u2019s rather stylish action, which starts with the concluding moments of the chase at the beginning which signals the start of her condition out in the woods where she finds the bodies of her friends and has to deal with the killer attacking her in order to get away, the few freak-outs she has while at her work with the thought of the killer attacking her as well as the scenes of them at the art gallery where it\u2019s proven that she was psychotic all along and goes after them in the gallery which has some solid stalking and slashing that\u2019s really nice and brutal. These here are quite nice enough although it is somewhat troubled. The biggest issue is that for the most part, this one doesn\u2019t really play like a true horror film rather than anything else. This one is really more of a character drama more than a horror film so for nearly all the movies\u2019 running time it doesn\u2019t do much of anything throughout here and seems to be a character study that doesn\u2019t contain all that much action at all. This isn\u2019t a huge detriment but it\u2019s more of one for those that like more traditional fare rather than this one.\r\n\r\nRated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence."}], "recommandations_id": [74718, 32150, 10109, 32229], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
