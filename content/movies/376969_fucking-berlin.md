Once there, she soon began to build up a new circle of friends, and then she fell in love with the kind, but irresponsible Ladja. There is only one big catch: the dear money is a bit scarce and therefore Sonia one day, financially, but also from curiosity, the path to prostitution. From now on, it leads a brisk double flight, which can fly at any time. Her experiences are ambivalent, as part-time she often gets into difficult situations, but also gets to know nice people, while she enjoys life just as a student. But how long can it maintain the double game?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hjRJy0A0e5XnhFrbEPve3jIf1tu.jpg", "actors": ["Svenja Jung (Sonja)", "Mateusz Dopieralski (Ladja)", "Michael Kind (Chickenmann)", "Rudolf Martin (Dr. Brenner)", "Christoph Letkowski (Milan)", "Charley Ann Schmutzler (Jule)", "J\u00f6rg Moukaddam (Kontrolleur)", "Ecco Mylla (Horst)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [436403], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
