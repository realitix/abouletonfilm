She is given responsibility to prepare a group of teen drop-outs for confirmation.  Instead, a confrontation over morality presses Mrs. Murphy to articulate convictions she didn\u2019t know she had.  This leads to a crisis of faith, and a shamefully exhilarating private moment.  A playful and distinctive short film that portrays an awkward journey, and raises taboo questions with no thought of delicacy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nW6OwbwDzrVGAFWcUrdMgUHc377.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
