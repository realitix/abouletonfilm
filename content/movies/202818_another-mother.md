The father is accompanied by his traumatized and mute eight-year-old son whom he had to kidnap from a Riga hospital. Together, the two flee towards Holland where the father Yuris hopes to find his long-lost friend Marie, whom he remembers as a great beauty. During the long journey, father and son have several funny adventures, many of which occur because neither father nor son speak much Dutch. They finally arrive at Marie's door empty-handed. What they find, gives them little hope, for the lithe young idealist of Yuris' dreams has become middle-aged and cynical.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iPJZqjETzzBSj0feAxxoFuE8MNr.jpg", "actors": ["Arys Adamsons (Elvis)", "Janis Reinis (Juris)", "Anneke Blok (Karin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
