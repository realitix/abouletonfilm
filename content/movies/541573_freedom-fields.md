But as the country descends into civil war and the utopian hopes of the \u201cArab Spring\u201d begin to fade, can they realise their dream? And is there even a country left to play for? Freedom Fields is a film about hope and sacrifice in a land where dreams seem a luxury. Through the eyes of these accidental activists we see the reality of a country in transition, where the personal stories of love, struggle and aspirations collide with History.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bd7l679TdyNsBYmRIUcNNGfBCaq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
