Comically unsuccessful in love over the course the year, including five half-hearted relationships with astoundingly self-centered men, Izzy resigns herself to the support of her mother and sister, who are struggling with their own relationship problems. Seeing herself in them, Izzy gradually gains the confidence to be honest and vulnerable.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kOIfl8eBQxqMkFjERyno7EFYCdj.jpg", "actors": ["Madelyn Deutch (Izzy Klein)", "Zoey Deutch (Sabrina Klein)", "Lea Thompson (Deb Klein)", "Melissa Bolona (Amythyst Stone)", "Avan Jogia (Sebastian Bennett)", "Nicholas Braun (Charlie Reed)", "Brandon T.
