And yet he rarely ventures out in public, prefers to keep quiet about his music, feels at home in the forests of Estonia and generates therewith - perhaps involuntarily - the impression of a recluse, which is attributed to him again and again: Arvo Part. In The Lost Paradise, we follow him over a period of one year in his native Estonia, to Japan and the Vatican. The documentary is framed by the stage production of Adam's Passion, a music theater piece based on the Biblical story of the fall of Adam featuring three key works by Arvo Part. The world-renowned director Robert Wilson has brought this work to the stage in a former submarine factory in Tallinn. Tracing their creative process, the film offers rare and personal insights into the worlds of two of the most fascinating personalities in the international arts and music scene.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3P8c5SU2UqKfsZLkV6OL8U7ITFr.jpg", "actors": ["Arvo P\u00e4rt (Himself)", "Robert Wilson (Himself)", "Sofia Gubaidulina ()", "Paul Hillier ()", "Gidon Kremer ()", "T\u00f5nu Kaljuste ()", "Madis Kolk ()", "Immo Mihkelson ()", "Toomas Siitan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
