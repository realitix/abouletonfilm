It laments the environmental destruction committed in the name of progress, particularly farming and timber practices which cause massive erosion and result in vast amounts of top soil being washed down the river into the Gulf of Mexico. The film focuses especially on the impact this has had on impoverished farmers. It ends on a very upbeat note, however, with a celebration of the TVA, \"modern\" farming technology, and the use of dams to control the river and prevent flooding.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/muEv14kOGlHj8tejIDuxsFhEEiC.jpg", "actors": ["Thomas Chalmers (Narrator (Voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [144788, 162666, 132159, 153180], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
