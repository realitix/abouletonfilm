Someone \u2019who knows the way and the language\u2019 can feel at home somewhere or is at least familiar with the vicinity. This popular expression suggests the relations between people within the seclusion of their village. This programme presents a portrait of the quiet and yet filled life in our villages, which cannot be looked upon as an anachronism.
