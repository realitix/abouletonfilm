Before long, Lizuca's father comes to take her away to live with him and his new bride, a vile woman who considers children the bane of all existence. Lizuca and the dachshund escape the wicked stepmother and spend the night in a hollow tree, a tree that changes into an enchanted land where Lizuca (like Alice through the Looking Glass) discovers a world of characters in the form of bees, frogs, the four seasons, Snow White, her dwarves, and other fairy tale creatures. This magic place is threatened by the evil stepmother's plan to sell the grove that protects the secret land to developers -- a decision that puts the woman on trial before this perfidy can be realized.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zlbdwLZTywGx2UgY9yHxBLeHXaz.jpg", "actors": ["Diana Musca (Lizuca)", "Ernest Maftei (Grandfather)", "Elena Dragoi (Grandmother)", "Florina Cercel (Stepmother)", "Matei Alexandru (Father)", "Draga Olteanu Matei (Cucoana Emilia)", "Ileana Stana Ionescu (Madam Neicu)", "Cezara Dafinescu (Dream Fairy)", "Rodica Popescu Bitanescu (The maid)", "Maria Ploae (Mother)", "Eugenia Maci (Bee fairy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
