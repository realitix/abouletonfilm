The Wilmington Massacre of 1898 was a bloody attack on the African-American community by a heavily armed white mob on November 10, 1898 in the port city of Wilmington, North Carolina. It is also considered one of the only examples of a violent overthrow of an existing government (coup d'etat) and left countless numbers of African-American citizens dead. This event was the springboard for the white supremacy movement and Jim Crow (segregation) throughout the state of North Carolina, and the American South.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/X5qkHxf8Ip4bTHK1E2blZK7rjr.jpg", "actors": ["Larry Reni Thomas (Himself)", "Dr. Lewin Manly (Himself)", "Dr. Lewin Manly (Herself)", "Inez Eason (Herself)", "Dr. Umar Johnson (Himself)", "Kent Chatfield (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "9toV2-zDWkA"}
