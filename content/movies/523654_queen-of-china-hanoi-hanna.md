It is Mary Woronov\u2019s showcase piece, in which she metes out physical and psychological abuse to Susan Bottomly, Angelina \u201cPepper\u201d Davis, and Ingrid Superstar in a room at the Chelsea Hotel. At first, the cast tries to accurately adhere to Tavel\u2019s scenario, but by reel two it all falls apart\u2014the performers begin to use their real names and exhibit a sort of residual stress disorder that permeates the rest of the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xig2S7RVfuotc0I5myw8OZ05l36.jpg", "actors": ["Mary Woronov ()", "Ingrid Superstar ()", "Angelina 'Pepper' Davis ()", "Susan Bottomly ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
