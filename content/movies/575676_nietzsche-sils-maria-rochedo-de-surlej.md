The influence of the environment on his ideas also forms the basis for Nietzsche Sils Maria Rochedo de Surlej, shot in the style of a travelogue, in which Bressane (together with his partner Rosa Dias and the young filmmaker Rodrigo Lima) guide us through the beautiful Swiss Sils Maria, where Nietzsche spent no less than eight summers.  In his letters, Nietzsche indicates which spots brought him to a different understanding of philosophy. He discovered, beyond the philosophical text, a source for ideas in the pure air, in the mountain landscapes, in the water of the lakes, and in the age-old forests", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/alxpnHXKu1Tl1SCYl8r0iWJYNei.jpg", "actors": ["Rosa Dias (Themself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
