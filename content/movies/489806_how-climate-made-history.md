For one, they were all starkly affected by extreme weather conditions. Indeed, if we take a fresh look at human history in the light of Earth\u2019s volatile climate, we can expose hidden parallels, draw surprising conclusions and explain bizarre historical conundrums. This feature-length documentary combines natural sciences and history, a journey from the Big Bang to Iceland\u2019s volcanoes \u2013 a gripping narrative that explores little-known connections between the Earth\u2019s climate and major historical events. Are these extremes of weather really a 21st-century phenomenon? Or has climate determined the fate of humanity ever since amphibians took their first steps on terra firma?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8NZDKlGKAdiOkho5JaCY96NBfPS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
