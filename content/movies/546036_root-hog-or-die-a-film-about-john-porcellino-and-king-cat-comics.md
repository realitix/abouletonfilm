In King-Cat, John beautifully renders the \"in-between moments\" - those instances which occupy the bulk of our lives, but can pass easily without notice: Sitting on the front porch. Peeing at a rest stop. Watching a bird. With humor, compassion and a keen eye, John shows readers what they might be missing, and in doing so inspires many to embrace life more fully. Born of the zine revolution of the late eighties/early nineties, King-Cat today is the template for cartoonists who seek to create work that is personal, well-crafted and free of outside influence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x8QruBOoFjdDA4F9BM2Du5kcfRc.jpg", "actors": ["John Porcellino (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
