This new documentary follows Warren Hepsworth who sets out to ride a pushbike from Perth to Melbourne on a low-carb, high-fat diet. You\u2019ll see Warren\u2019s preparation for the ride as well as highlights and lowlights from the journey, and the diet change.  The movie attempts to debunk the notion that athletes have to carb load and that you can\u2019t get your energy from fat. In the process we learn that much of what we\u2019ve been told about a healthy diet is wrong.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w0krcgKOQtHQPbsVcPJ92TB17jw.jpg", "actors": ["Warren Hepsworth (Warren Hepsworth)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
