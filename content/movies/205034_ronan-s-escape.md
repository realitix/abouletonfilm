This accurate &amp; controversial portrayal of life for someone who has fallen victim to bullying and the repercussions which exist, is told by director A.J. Carter in a unique, exposition intensive format with very little use of dialogue. Ronan's Escape presents arbitrary scenes rather than traditional storytelling which provokes audiences into discussion and interpretation of the scenes on a more personal level while reflecting on their own experiences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/azXy6fGqH0MoMu6WTifqIXCRskx.jpg", "actors": ["David Lazarus (Ronan)", "Ashleigh Zinko (Sally)", "Louie Vann Praag (Gym Instructor)", "Kirstie Francis (Ronan's Mother)", "Matthew Hennighan (Colin 'Baton Race Bully')", "Mark Kont (Bus Driver)", "Ryan Cammiade (Ryan 'Soccer Bully')"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "lGQzOLBTpV4"}
