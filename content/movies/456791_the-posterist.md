It captures the life and art of the self-taught genius who single-handedly depicted the look and feel of what can be describe as the Golden Era of Hong Kong Cinema from 1975 to 1992.\r Western audiences might recognize some familiar faces from the prolific painter's recent works - undeniably breathtaking - such as the portraits of Marlon Brando, Michael Jackson, James Dean, John Lennon, Audrey Hepburn and Anne Hathaway.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ny6PvPVti7nh3n40X6lUtvL3OkB.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Hui ()", "Kenny Bee ()", "Joe Cheung ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
