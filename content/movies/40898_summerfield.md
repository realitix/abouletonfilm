From the opening scene to close this film is flawless in its execution of a gritty and gripping story that will keep you thinking long after. The setting could not be more perfect, with wonderful use of the Aussie landscape, and both the acting and characterisation is engaging to say the least. A must-see gem of Australian film, and well-worthy of an international name."}], "recommandations_id": []}
