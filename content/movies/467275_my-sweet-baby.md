I was having doubts over my qualifications for being a mother, but I did not give up my work. For 10 years, I brought up 3 children and I can say that was a time during which I cared for my inner self. I realize that my inner self is a child and in need of care. So this film is a sort of baby book which confesses how a person like me could be a mother.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
