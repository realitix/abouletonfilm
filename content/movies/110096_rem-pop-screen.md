It also includes the video for \"Talk About The Passion\" from Murmur. This particular video was made to promote the compilation Eponymous which was released between Document and Green, and this is the reason for its otherwise anachronistic inclusion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gUye9zY1egRlh5Q2pMNcYDqJiv2.jpg", "actors": ["R.E.M.
