They spent some time together, they went to the movies often, they gave away things, they traveled. The girl leaves the boy. The boy believed that she was the woman of his life. She gives him a notebook with drawings (the best he knows how to do) and with all the tickets of all the movies that he went to see. The boy takes a camera. A 22-year-old boy who exposes himself in such a way in a film, which expresses himself in the first person offering us some pages of a newspaper, his, which no other person could write in his place, talking to us without concessions of his first history of love and the pain of a break, is not frequent. A boy who shares his pain, the need to film what he loves and what he is losing, his learning of life and the world through cinema -the cinema alone- is also infrequent. A gesture of a filmmaker.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
