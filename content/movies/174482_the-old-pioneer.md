It's decent and quite representative of animation from the period, from my experiences in this field. The negative is that it had then-typical stereotyped views of Native Americans, but on the plus side, it encouraged friendship, as in the flashback, the pioneer's life was spared when the chief about to attack him heard from the child that he saved its life. I hope to check out the others in this series in due time, maybe on YouTube."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
