We watched _Lake Alice_ for exactly two reasons. \r\n1) It has a cool poster.\r\n2) I live with a girl named Alice.\r\n\r\nThat's it. That's all I had to go on as far as expectations went. Yet somehow, it's so awful, I managed to disappointed all the same. No character is likeable, virtually no decision makes sense, the cool poster is a lie, and despite only half paying attention, we were all able to discern the killer's identity, through nothing more than process of elimination.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605 - Of no value. Avoid at all costs._"}], "recommandations_id": [469523, 83172, 513510, 415826], "youtube_key": "-uR7JVMXOus"}
