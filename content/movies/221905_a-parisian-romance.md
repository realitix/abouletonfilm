He has a key-chain with about 50 keys to different women' apartments in Paris. He selects one at random to see who he will sleep with at night. His adversary is a young Parisian artist (the next Picasso), Victor. Victor believes in love and he's going to marry his girlfriend Claudette as soon as he sells his first painting. The Baron seduces Claudette, seemingly to teach Victor a lesson. However, as might be predicted, he soon falls in love with Claudette himself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m3uZkLC6sagkzZnG7pHAzh2PbsR.jpg", "actors": ["Lew Cody (Baron)", "Marion Shilling (Claudette)", "Gilbert Roland (Victor)", "Joyce Compton (Marcelle)", "Yola d'Avril (Pauline)", "Nicholas Soussanin (Emil)", "George J.
