Forty-odd \"Skipjacks\" were still used by Maryland watermen to dredge up oysters from the Bay. At that time, the fleet had survived because of a Maryland conservation law which prohibits the use of motor power for oyster dredging. The watermen traditionally marked the opening of each oystering season with a skipjack race which the Maryland State Tourist Board incorporated into its annual \"Chesapeake Bay Appreciation Day.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mNdPdtB6dMctizCNk8mXCmSxUI9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
