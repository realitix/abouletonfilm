The DVD offers 17 of the band's songs, most of which are found on the two CD albums \"Sehnsucht\" and \"Herzeleid.\" The show itself is a very entertaining performance with plenty of the usual stunts, pyrotechnics, and lighting effects you'd expect from an industrial metal band.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8DLrWbft4bzqEQGAYh1yXZ39MN2.jpg", "actors": ["Till Lindemann (Himself)", "Oliver Riedel (Himself)", "Paul Landers (Himself)", "Richard Kruspe (Himself)", "Christoph Schneider (Himself)", "Christian Lorenz (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [47800, 119213, 81246], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
