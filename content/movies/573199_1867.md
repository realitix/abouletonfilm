This short dramatic film evokes the artist's studio and the events of Maximilian's death, using a single, uninterrupted shot to present the artistic thought process through the eyes of the painter. The narration, written by the film's director, takes the form of an imagined interior monologue, presented in voice-over style in French and German with English subtitles. It alludes to the narrative, historical and visual texts that Manet drew upon to form his four versions of the painting.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b18M04F6tyF3FgVvEv1UqCefPfP.jpg", "actors": ["Lutz Becker (Maximilian)", "Filipe Ferrer (Emperor Maximilian)", "Andr\u00e9 Gomes (General Miramon)", "Jo\u00e3o Carlos Siqueira (Manet)", "Zazy (General Mejia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
