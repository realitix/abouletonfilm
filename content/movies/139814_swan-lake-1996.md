Seldom have the dark psychological riptides at the heart of so many classical ballets been so brilliantly exposed. The Prince (Scott Ambler) is a wretched and dissolute young man dominated by his mother, the Joan Collins-like Queen (Fiona Ambler). Shades of Tennessee Williams, indeed. Von Rothbart becomes a press secretary, more sinister \u00e9minence grise than hissable villain. Most startling of all, The Swan (Adam Cooper) is a muscular, emphatically masculine male.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uw2VK5wdJ8z9fyK8lTSnd5n0S9s.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
