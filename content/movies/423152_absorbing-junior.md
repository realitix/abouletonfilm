When Johnny's mother-in-law tells them to take Junior to the dentist to have a tooth pulled, and gives them $2 for the doctor, the game is afoot. The money goes to Henry's bookie, and the boys decide to pull Junior's tooth themselves... by tying a string onto the back bumper of a car. But a pet parrot spills the beans, and mother-in-law goes chasing after them with fire in her eye, and a fireplace poker under her coat.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Shemp Howard (Henry, the Husband)", "John Berkes (Johnnie)", "Gertrude Mudge (Johnnie's Mother-in-Law)", "Gerrie Worthing (Johnnie's Wife)", "Ken Lundy (Junior)", "Morton Havel (Dr. Nova Kane's Assistant)", "Arthur Havel (Dr. Nova Kane)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
