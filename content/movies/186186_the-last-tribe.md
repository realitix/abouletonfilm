The sons and daughters of the Jewish immigrants who settled in the city over 150 years ago share their personal stories and reflect on the history and current situation of the community in this British city. After enduring years of Russian persecution, many Jews escaped to what they thought was America, but turned out to be Britain. They settled in the city and began their social and economic climb. A touching and humorous film that offers rare insight into the struggles and successes of the Jews of Britain.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cQJaiJguNkyI1pdujSuV0GcGHY2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
