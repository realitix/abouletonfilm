One of these girls, Stacy, is back from the dead, however, and she's ready to gorge herself on human flesh. As more and more teenage-girl zombies begin to feast on the living, the people of Japan brace themselves and try to find a way to end the madness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rOgLj1axMwrEkw4r7fecmsIXTXW.jpg", "actors": ["Norman England (Jeff)", "Tomoka Hayashi (Nozomi)", "Yukijiro Hotaru ()", "Ry\u00f4ichi Inaba ()", "Natsuki Kato (Eiko)", "Ry\u00fbki Kitaoka ()", "Shir\u00f4 Misawa ()", "Masayoshi Nogami (Father)", "Toshinori Omi (Shibukawa)", "Hinako Saeki ()", "Yoji Tanaka (Rokuyama)", "Masayoshi Tomomatsu ()", "Donpei Tsuchihira ()", "Yasutaka Tsutsui (Dr. Inugami Sukekiyo)", "Kenji Otsuki ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [94265, 48808, 256742, 183661], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
