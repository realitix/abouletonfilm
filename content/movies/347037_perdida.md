Viviana Garc\u00eda Besn\u00e9 tells how it was that her family, \u2018the Calder\u00f3ns\u2019, played an essential role in the production, distribution and exhibition of that primitive \u201cother Hollywood\u201d. Lost in Time is a touching film because of those surprises the director finds each time she comes across with that invaluable family footage, which was more forgotten than lost; or when her relatives tell stories she thought to be hilarious and made up, and which she later finds out to be true (like a shattered romance between her grandmother and Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n, for instance). Garc\u00eda Besn\u00e9 makes the most out of the contrasts that surface between the different visual formats she uses and all that found footage she finds. Lost in Time is a master class of cinema, any way you look at it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3b4gN2yhz3osCjOkqJV2mFz82ps.jpg", "actors": ["Nin\u00f3n Sevilla ()", "Ana Luisa Peluffo ()", "Armando Silvestre ()", "Ricardo Montalban ()", "Rafael Incl\u00e1n ()", "Mate Calder\u00f3n ()", "Guillermo Calder\u00f3n ()", "Rafael Calder\u00f3n Jr. ()", "Pedro A.
