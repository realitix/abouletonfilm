Over the next six days, television and radio reports, home video, and police footage captured the turmoil that led to 54 deaths, nearly 12,000 arrests, and over $1 billion in damages. Using these recordings, we take a look at one of the biggest periods of civil unrest in American history as if it were all unfolding in real time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/da36KDiVHdG9RWNSnymle07mTkP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "q0P56AbmWs0"}
