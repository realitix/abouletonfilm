The two decide to form a band and put together an unlikely crew that consists of the school bully, an ex-punk-turned-barista, and a former-childstar-turned-band-manager. The film follows their misadventures as they face satanic S&amp;M bands, samurai swindlers, narcissistic rockstars, the pretentious Philippine art community and the freakiest music video auteur ever. Co-written by Diego Castillo, the guitarist of one of the Philippines' biggest rock bands SANDWICH, and directed by multi-awarded music video director Quark Henares, Rakenrol is a heartfelt ode to the underground scene both filmmakers spent their formative years in.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mX0eKYTP6TkqWvi8WRoDnVrzq5z.jpg", "actors": ["Jason Avalos (Odie)", "Glaiza de Castro (Irene)", "Diether Ocampo (Jacci Rocha)", "Matet De Leon (Matet De Leon)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
