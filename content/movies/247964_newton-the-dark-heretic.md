Newton, the father of modern mathematics, dedicated a large part of his life to a quest to decode the Bible which he believed to be the word of God.  For over 50 years, he studied the Bible trying to unravel God's secret laws of the Universe.  He was fanatical in his quest to discover the date for the Second Coming of Christ and the end of the world.  Scholars have spent years trying to unravel Newton's writings on the Book of Revelation to establish when he thought the apocalypse was coming.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Philip Harvey (Royal Society Speaker)", "Phillip Keiman (Sir William James)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
