It was undeniably inventive on Give Me Love and signalled that Sheeran\u2019s a songwriter with an eccentric streak, even if he did admit another tune, This, was \"a bit soppy and wet\".\r\n\r\nHowever, perhaps because of Sheeran's autonomy, this show suffered from over-indulgence, whether that meant him boring us about how much he drinks on his annual pilgrimage to Latitude Festival back home in Suffolk or feeling the requirement to wrestle songs into submission.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the frantic You Need Me, I Don't Need You was an enervating, 20-minute folly despite being perked up mid-way by guest rappers Wretch 32, Devlin, Sway and Chip.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Sheeran had a clear connection with his fans \u2013 and not just during soaring, emotive hits The A Team, Drunk and Lego House.\r\n\r\nHis smouldering cover of Nina Simone's Be My Husband seemed a slightly baffling choice for a male artist, until you realised he was going to be drowned out by teenage girls singing that lyric.\r\n\r\nA duet of Chasing Cars with Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody was an affecting highlight during this celebratory show for competition winners. It sets Sheeran up nicely for his attempt to conquer the US."}], "recommandations_id": []}
