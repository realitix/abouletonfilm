The filmmaker dealt with the personal situations (such as deaths of relatives) of the characters and filmed them in dramatic situations. The films reflect not only the individual life stories of the characters but also provide profound insight into the history of the GDR and the reunification process with West Germany. After the end of the GDR and therefore the DEFA, Junge continued the \"Golzow-Project\" with the ARD and its regional affiliate RBB.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Winfried Junge (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
