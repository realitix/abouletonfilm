Since the release of their debut album \u201cHeartbound\u201d, the band has amounted well over 100 shows worldwide \u2013 notching up two US tours, two European tours, and running through Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. They somehow found time to play an afternoon slot to massive crowds on Soundwave, and are currently taking the time to hit the less travelled regions of Australia for touring bands \u2013 from Tasmania to North Queensland and the Northern Territory \u2013 no place is off the map for this six-piece.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7z8NLP6q8e9QFkTYU0zZDrgUSPL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "JKcOYhWwWpI"}
