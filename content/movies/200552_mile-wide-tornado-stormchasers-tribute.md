Via in-depth interviews with scientists and the latest data, it looks at how this tornado formed, how it was different from a similar EF5 tornado that hit in the same area in 1999 and the role the warning system had in saving lives. Discovery interviews meteorologists, storm chasers and emergency management who battled to save lives during that fateful day with exclusive footage of now condemned areas. This special provides one of the most comprehensive collections of user-generated footage of the Oklahoma tornado to date and conducts original interviews with those who recorded those first-hand accounts.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zHcUKskWVtd8dDzHsCYNTDmKv0I.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
