In 1970, the Old World Southern gay culture was changing, enter The Pagan Babies, a loose group of artists and drag queens who set out to challenge the hierarchical homosexual society with guerrilla theater interventions and fantastic costumes. Before Robert Mapplethorpe's infamous photos, there was R. Michael Walker and John Ashley who documented the Pagan Babies. The film also features a Kuchar film and this is what happened.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wxnUGbuXY27ACxTEgZwm3aZQMLj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
