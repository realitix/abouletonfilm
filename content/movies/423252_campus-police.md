Officers Colin McCoy and Dan Foley expect this week to be business as usual, but are caught off-guard when they're suddenly thrust into a storm of conspiracy and corruption, all surrounding a series of attacks by a mysterious flasher. Over the course of the week, they face apathetic theatre students, singing buffoons, office politics, a psychic palm-reader, and a drug-crazed lunatic who launch them into the most high-profile case of their careers. Campus Police is a film in the spirit of the zany, screwball comedies of yesteryear.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/MzBD4p9g8IvDwfNsgo22vhRTit.jpg", "actors": ["Matthew DeHoff (Officer Dan Foley)", "Ryan Konig (Officer Colin McCoy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
