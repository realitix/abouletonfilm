Deadly bored, he sinks into the depths of depression and requests the help of a psychiatrist. But his imagination is far more effective: In his dreams, he chases gangsters in London. Finally, some small-time crooks find a way to help \"their\" policeman out of his emotional misery: They steal a memorial from the market square and thus help Holms to a spectacular case.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/akaepVjCShpTZIoKMM93REPNcdt.jpg", "actors": ["Rolf Herricht (Holms)", "Zden\u011bk \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nek (Pinkas)", "Evelyn Cron (Lucie)", "Herbert K\u00f6fer (Heuschnupf das Aas)", "Agnes Kraus (Frau Schulze)", "Eberhard Cohrs (Fleischer)", "Fred Delmare (Gauner)", "Hans Joachim Preil ()", "Gerd E.
