There he meets Heather, who seems to be one friend short of company. Del Boy, ever the gentleman, entertains her and sees her home safely. At her flat he discovers that she has a young son, to a husband who seems to have joined a very long queue at the Job Centre 18 months ago and not come back. In no time at all their romance blossoms, and all is running so smoothly Del decides to propose. However, when he takes her for a candle-lit curry, she refuses his offer of marriage. Her husband has returned, employed as a department store Santa, and she wants to give it another go... leaving Del Boy without an angel for Christmas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kNSPtCCyxRU9tXrkb2voBHlwdhe.jpg", "actors": ["David Jason (Derek 'Del Boy' Trotter)", "Nicholas Lyndhurst (Rodney Trotter)", "Lennard Pearce (Granddad)", "Rosalind Lloyd (Heather)", "Roger Brierley (Brian)", "John Moreno (Enrico)", "Dev Sagoo (Indian Waiter)", "Daniel Jones (Darren)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
