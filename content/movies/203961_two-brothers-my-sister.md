Maria is the shy and dutiful daughter upon whose shoulders the family traumas have fallen. In addition to a regular job she cooks, cleans, and studies. Her parents offer no assistance as her father is blind, with a tendency towards violence when drinking. His wife, the focus of his violence is terribly unhappy. After a particularly brutal beating, Maria's brothers rise up against the father and end up leaving the home. It is up to Maria to try to bring the factions together. Maria's pressures increase after she calmly stabs her boss during an attempted rape, and then copes with her mother's suicide.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qQGjcwRpMcHW0KH6ltVD6Mk03GU.jpg", "actors": ["Maria de Medeiros (Maria)", "Marcello Urgeghe (M\u00e1rio)", "Evgeniy Sidikhin (Jo\u00e3o)", "Laura del Sol (Teresa)", "Mireille Perrier (The Teacher)", "Olimpia Carlisi (The Mother)", "Lu\u00eds Miguel Cintra (Friend at the Apartment)", "Orlando Costa (1st Policeman)", "Io Apolloni (Hotel Clerk)", "Miguel Borges (Client)", "Marco Delgado (Boy in the Disco)", "Pedro Cabrita Reis (Man in the Bat)", "Isabel Ruth (Voice of Mother (voice))", "Laura Soveral (Suburban Lady)", "Teresa Villaverde (Voice of the Teacher (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
