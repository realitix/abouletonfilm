But it tries really hard. It tries to be good, it tries to be original, it tries to appeal to so many disparate groups, it tries to go in a completely new direction. This trying mostly translates to failure, and I guess I can see that, but _Chronicles of Riddick_ still had such a massive impact on me, that I still have to recommend it.\r\n\r\n_\"Threshold!
