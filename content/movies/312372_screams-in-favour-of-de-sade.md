Like the original this film has no images, but whereas Debord's consisted of black with silence and white with dialogue in French, mine has black with silence and TV colour bars with dialogue in English. The original dialogue is translated and in a number of places also rewritten. However, while Debord had five voices reading his script, I have one voice with an additional spoken indication of which voice is speaking.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bKT8ulhapFiBDMfas0KWiRX833V.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
