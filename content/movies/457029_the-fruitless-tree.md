Married but childless, director Aicha Macky\u2019s circumstance is judged unacceptable in her native Niger. Doctors haven\u2019t been able to determine why she can\u2019t conceive, but in her conservative Muslim society, women are always getting blamed for infertility, while men are rarely diagnosed. Speaking to her departed mother who died in childbirth, she expresses her deep sadness: \u201cBy giving life, you lost yours, whereas I\u2019m dying a slow death by not being able to give life.\u201d Drawing from her personal experience, Macky bravely addresses the taboo of childlessness and the stigma Nigerien women like her must endure. Through delicate, exquisitely shot portraits, and sensitive observation of other women\u2019s secret suffering, she finds a way to affirm herself as a fulfilled individual among mothers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q42PiDMQmwXzmAhgwOp6W7aL35e.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
