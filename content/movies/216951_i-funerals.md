Due to her family situation, Isabel is cynical and skeptical of everything that comes her way.  When she enters the I-libings for her required college internship, she sees it as the worst internship her college adviser could suggest to her.  Later as she accumulates her required hours, she realizes that the company is not just a place where videographers make money out of other people\u2019s misfortunes but is a place where the dead and the grieving receive special attention.  It all comes full circle when Isabel is faced with an unusual family tragedy.  Isabel realizes that her internship might have been just 200 hours, but the lessons that the I-libings left her would last a lifetime.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cbtHtWdppZQiOdEzYVOgKiBxLNe.jpg", "actors": ["Glaiza de Castro (Isabel Fabros)", "Carlo Aquino ()", "Rez Cortez ()", "Dexter Doria ()", "Marc Abaya ()", "Osan Reodica (Rachel)", "Betty Uy-Regala (Elaiza)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
