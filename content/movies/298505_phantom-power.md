PHANTOM POWER is a kind of sum of these rich and lavish efforts, a poetic series of cinematic fragments, an inventory of his cinematic output. What unfolds between russian folk songs and Ingrid Caven\u2019s singing, between micro-dramas and found footage, is the poetic world of this wayward and still unknown artist, whose discovery and recognition is long overdue.  - Viennale", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2cYCDiPaOaHEic5cHg7acZyCIPJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
