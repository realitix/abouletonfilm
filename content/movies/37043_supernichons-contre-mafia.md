Yes, she of the 73-inch breasts returns to the silver screen in this astonishingly cheap pseudo-sequel which is even more outrageous than it's predecessor. Here Chesty plays super agent Jane Tenay who is tailing a string of heroin pushers. A camera is planted in her bosom and she is instructed to photograph everyone that she eliminates, which she accomplishes by squeezing her mammoth mammories! Chock full of the typical Doris Wishman \"trademarks\" (close-ups of inanimate objects such as an ashtray, feet, or usually Chesty's massive cleavage) this flick was sampled in the John Waters comedy classic \"Serial Mom\"...it must be seen to be believed!"}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
