Carrying three precious jewels to give to the baby Messiah, Artaban and his reluctant servant Orontes set off to join the caravan of the three other wise men. They miss the caravan, but Artaban continues the search for his King, always one step behind. Artaban spends much of his remaining wealth and all of his energy helping the poor and unfortunate people he meets, until at the end of his life he finally finds Jesus--at His trial! Has Artaban wasted his life in a foolish quest? Will he ever get the chance to present his gifts to the King?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lmIxglYl3u14V9wlTofJrFeSVF2.jpg", "actors": ["Martin Sheen (Artaban)", "Alan Arkin (Orontes)", "James Farentino (Jesus (voice))", "Eileen Brennan (Judith)", "Harold Gould (Rabbi)", "Lance Kerwin (Passhur)", "Jerry Houser (Peter)", "Charlie Sheen (Maximus)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [2447], "youtube_key": "VBSV7xyVn5s"}
