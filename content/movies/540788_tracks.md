It\u2019s a collage film which combines photographic, animated and live-action parts, black and white and colour footage. The voice-over soundtrack is partly a reworking and rewording of individual experiences and also a reflection on perceived actions of women due to historical and contemporary circumstance. It draws on a rich collection of personal and public imagery, re-made and manipulated, layered and textured, while taking a critical look at certain feminist theories.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7m05VZBl4Men5vj0f23Y0kML4AX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
