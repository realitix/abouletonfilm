For years, England and France have been at war with each other. Now, France sends three men to the British colony of Jamaica to organize a slave revolt. The envoys are Debuisson, the grandson of a Jamaican rum manufacturer, who knows the island very well, his old friend Sasportas, and the sailor Galloudec. After having established contact with the fragmented rebel groups, they receive the surprising news of Napoleon\u2032s takeover in France. Whereas Debuisson, who by now has gotten used to his role as a rich heir, wants to wait for new instructions from home, his companions are determined to press ahead with the revolt. When a slave kills a British guard, the situation escalates.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4OIRXEjEExmpHhiM4lw59LAXwBW.jpg", "actors": ["Alexander Lang (Sasportas)", "Amza Pellea (Debuisson)", "J\u00fcrgen Holtz (Galloudec)", "Erwin Geschonneck (Bering)", "Heidemarie Wenzel (Elisabeth)", "K\u00e4the Reichel (Tante)", "Milan Beli (Bloomfield)", "Herbert K\u00f6fer (Myrtle)", "Axel Triebel (Vetter James)", "Volkmar Kleinert (Galdy)", "Rolf Hoppe (Pfarrer Clark)", "Szymon Szurmiej ()", "Rafael Sosa ()", "Samuel Claxton ()", "Thomas Neumann (Cousin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
