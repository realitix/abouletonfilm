This is the last straw for his loving but fed up parents and his father kicks him out of the house. Having nowhere to go he becomes a carguard. After a very hostile reception by the other carguards, the eldest carguard decides to take Johnathan under his wing and teaches him the finer art of being a carguard and more important he teaches Jonathan about life and how to survive as an outcast.
