After finding the bank closed and the streets seemingly swarming with thieves, Salama decides to place the company money in a safe at the luxurious Nefretiti Palace Hotel. But things go hilariously awry when the hotel manager mistakes him for an eagerly-awaited guest, the wealthy Prince Kandahar of Bloudestan. As in the early films of The Marx Brothers and other timeless screwball comedies of the 1930s, Everything Is Fine pokes fun at society's elite while taking viewers on a fast-paced comedic romp that will leave audiences of all ages feeling fine.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/86M7aG3pnQmKSEPAnauC0zKwJI8.jpg", "actors": ["Naguib Al Rihani (Salama)", "Raqiya Ibrahim ()", "Rawhiyya Khaled ()", "Hussein Riad (Kindahar)", "Hassan Fayek ()", "Estafan Rosti ()", "Ferdoos Mohammed ()", "Amina Shkeeb ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
