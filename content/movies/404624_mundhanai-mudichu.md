These often end her and the gang in the panchayat. A widower (K. Bhagyaraj) enters the village with his infant child (Sujitha) to take up the vacant teacher's post in the local school and is immediately pranked by Parimalam's gang upon his arrival. Parimalam's playful nature transforms into love when she learns that he's a widower. She tries many ways to win the teacher's heart, but fails every time. The teacher believes that a stepmother could not care for his child. As a desperate measure to attain him, Parimalam falsely accuses the teacher of molesting her. She even swears upon the teacher's child's life to prove her case at the panchayat.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xtug5Kl6EKeq5cl24sAklfA58LL.jpg", "actors": ["K.
