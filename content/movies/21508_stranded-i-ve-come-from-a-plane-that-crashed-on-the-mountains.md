On October 13, 1972, a young rugby team from Montevideo, Uruguay, boarded a plane for a match in Chile\u2014and then vanished into thin air. Two days before Christmas, 16 of the 45 passengers miraculously resurfaced. They had managed to survive for 72 days after their plane crashed on a remote Andean glacier.
