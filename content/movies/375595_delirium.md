The video layers haunting imagery and humorous iconoclasm, referencing everything from television episodes of I Love Lucy to Charcot\u2019s 19th Century photos of female hysterics. Delirium contends that female mental illness must be understood within the political/social arena, and that in many instances women\u2019s reactions of violence, anger, and depression are indeed sane reactions to abhorrent situations. -http://www.vdb.org/titles/delirium", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
