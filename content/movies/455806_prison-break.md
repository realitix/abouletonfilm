He forces open the glass window and breaks out of jail. This crime even reaches the ears of Urata Susumu, the chief warden of Kosuge Prison in Tokyo. Urata had been in charge of those sentenced to life in the prison until last year. Although Sakuma is a dangerous person who had also broken out of jail in Aomori, he submits to Urata who is the only person who had treated him kindly in the past. However, three months after escaping from jail, Sakuma shows up at Urata\u2019s house. He has come to complain about the inhumane Akita prison officers. But he is locked up again after Urata notifies the police during an unguarded moment. A year later, Sakuma is sent to Abashiri Prison and Urata is also ordered to transfer as the prison\u2019s chief warden.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j90PiutxZtCZdrI2PWwz7TGNzN3.jpg", "actors": ["Takeshi Kitano (Urata)", "Takayuki Yamada ()", "Hikari Mitsushima ()", "Susumu Terajima ()", "Yutaka Matsushige ()", "Hiroyuki Ikeuchi ()", "Aoi Nakamura ()", "Isao Hashizume ()", "Masanobu Katsumura ()", "Ikkei Watanabe ()", "Yo Yoshida ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
