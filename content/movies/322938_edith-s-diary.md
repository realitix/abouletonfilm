On top of heading toward a divorce and being unable to handle her son's asocial tendencies, her neurotic uncle moves in, demanding personalized care. Just to keep her sanity intact, Edith starts writing in her diary to vent her own feelings and ambitions. As her son goes from bad to worse over a five-year period, it turns out that Edith's diary may be of more benefit than she could have ever imagined. In this adaptation of Edith's Diary by Patricia Highsmith, director and writer Hans W. Geissendoerfer has maintained Highsmith's psychologically tormented characters while changing the location and time of her story from the U.S. of the 1960s to Germany in the early 1980s.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h1FLGmqe6VW4Y9Zqu2oC7YETfDc.jpg", "actors": ["Angela Winkler (Edith Baumeister)", "Vadim Glowna (Paul Baumeister)", "Leopold von Verschuer (Chris Baumeister)", "Hans Madin (Uncle George)", "Irm Hermann (Sabina Angerwolf)", "Wolfgang Condrus (Bernd Angerwolf)", "Friedrich G.
