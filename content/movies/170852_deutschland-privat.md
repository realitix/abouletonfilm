In the ads he announced that he was planning to blow up and mount the best of those movies into a feature documentary to be released in German cinemas. He was surprised how many home movies he received and how generously people allowed him to use them for his feature. Part 1 of \"Deutschland privat\" gives us typical German home movies of the 1970s, i.e. private holidays, family parties, etc. Part 2 consists of what is now called \"amateur porn\"; home made 8mm movies featuring real porn action.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xbaYfBj0lfKOB239Uvd2cjoXdty.jpg", "actors": ["Udo Kier ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
