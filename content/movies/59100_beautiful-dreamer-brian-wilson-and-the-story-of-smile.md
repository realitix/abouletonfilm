The new album was to be called \"SMiLE\". SMiLE pushed the envelope both musically and lyrically, and was supposed to out-do the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper record. But Brian wasn't able to sell the project to his band-mates when they returned. The project was shelved and Wilson's well-documented decline into depression, drug abuse, recluseness, and obesity had begun. Thirty-odd years later, Wilson announced that in 2004, SMiLE would be performed live in its entirety in London. This film tells the story of a damaged but healing artist bringing his greatest work to light.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c57F9JY7cz8eWukCKzyc1MvEsAi.jpg", "actors": ["Brian Wilson (Himself)", "David Anderle ()", "Hal Blaine ()", "Jeff Bridges ()", "Elvis Costello ()", "Roger Daltrey ()", "Natalie Imbruglia ()", "Carol Kaye ()", "George Martin ()", "Paul McCartney ()", "Van Dyke Parks ()", "Sylvie Simmons ()", "Michael Vosse ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
