Ezra and Nehemiah get right to work, helping to rebuild Jerusalem after the exile. Ezra takes charge of restoring the temple while Nehemiah rebuilds the wall around Jerusalem that is meant to keep the city safe. Meanwhile, a brave woman named Esther takes a big chance \u2013 standing up to evil Haman and risking her own life in the process \u2013 and saves all God\u2019s people from certain death. In Exile and Return! [Ezra, Nehemiah &amp; Esther] we explore the last of the Historical Books and learn how, after years in Assyria and Babylon, God\u2019s people find their way back home to Jerusalem once again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kTmRBBHz46IZFUfbEV6VVb0RvXH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
