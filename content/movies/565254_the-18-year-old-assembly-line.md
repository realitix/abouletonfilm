We met and interviewed a few factory workers there. Most of them are incredibly young, and belong to the so called \u2018post-90s generation\u2019 (born later than 1990). This generation, as a result of China\u2019s one child policy, has traditionally been claimed as \u2018the little emperors\u2019, spoiled hugely by their parents.

Difficulties, hope, helplessness, or a better future?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wLYdGhUawgWaOnDhKXVycZaDbw4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
