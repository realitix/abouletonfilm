Two movers are talking to each other about the murder of a saxophone player that took place in the house. They say his ghost still roams the house. Night comes and every noise and creak in the house scares the papa, mama and son (the daughter is out on a date). The Mover gives the daughter a parrot saying \"It's a religious parrot \u2013 I bought it from a sailor\". At any rate, the parrot gets into the act by yelling scaring Papa and Son who have come down looking for the source of the noise. Later Daughter and Remover return from a costume party and sneak into the house. The young man is dressed in a skeleton outfit and the fun continues. There has been film reconstruction in a number of places, particularly the last third of the film. In many cases there is a photograph depicting the scene being described.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8nJC8Ism5MDAaITYeFQEuBzHauo.jpg", "actors": ["Max Davidson ()", "Gene Morgan ()", "Polly Moran ()", "Viola Richard ()", "Charles Dorety ()", "Edgar Dearing ()", "Charlie Hall ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
