In this episode of the popular and uncensored shoot-style DVD series, Chyna disturbingly says of the adult video, \"It's something that was done TO me. I call it the rape-tape,\" she says. Chyna's portrayal of the time with Waltman, while never outlaying specific instances, suggests physical abuse and drug-addled rages. It's a segment of the normally light-hearted and fun series, which turns a bit dark. Chyna is visibly disturbed when the topic occasionally steers toward Waltman.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Sean Oliver (Himself)", "Chyna (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
