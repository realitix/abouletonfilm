When a woman leaves her blind son at the Monastery, Ryotatsu is forced to teach the boy how to cope as a blind person in old Japan. When he takes the child with him on the road to find the boy's mother, they run afoul of not only yakuza gangsters, but some corrupt army officers have been trying to sway public opinion against the Satsuma rebels by posing as members of Saigo Takamori's group. It's a bloody mistake for them to underestimate the strength of the Blind Priest, and he'll make them pay with their lives!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5LIhIRDVuXrTwpVt8syeeNo0PKi.jpg", "actors": ["Bunta Sugawara (Blind Priest Ryotatsu)", "Tomisabur\u014d Wakayama (Dr. Mitamura)", "Akiko Kud\u00f4 (Maya)", "Minoru Oki (Banri)", "Naruhiko Umechi (Rintaro)", "Bin Amatsu ()", "Meich\u00f4 Soganoya ()", "Takuz\u00f4 Kawatani ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
