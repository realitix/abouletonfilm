Which physically does \u2018begin\u2019, reversed, upside down on the screen [\u2026] suddenly another such position is taken (not in reverse), this time by a male figure and soon, in this same section, the girl of the reversed image reappears posed in a different way; a way obsessed by \u2018mood\u2019. Then a technical play of in-the-camera-editing occurs, more intense, brighter than in the first, reversed section. There are several inter-cuts which serve, in this and each subsequent section unto the end, as relative links into the final section: which is actually the \u2018story\u2019. The story the protagonist and her hero try to tell in their way is apophysis; except that \u2018pictures\u2019, clear visions take the place of words. My film could have been edited with precise tensions and a lucid straight narrative, but it was my aim to \u2018re-create\u2019 the protagonist of my personal life.\u201d - Edward Owens", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2hjR4eYfRGfHANjVORvkQxyWPay.jpg", "actors": ["Gloria Rich ()", "John Butkovich ()", "Joellyn Pullam ()", "Micheal Hunt ()", "Robert Paige ()", "Richard White ()", "Liliyan Mecili ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
