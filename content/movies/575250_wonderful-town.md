A true declaration of love to the city of New-York, Wonderful Town tells the tale, with a boisterous rhythm and vast amounts of jazzy tunes, of two sisters from Ohio looking for success and glory in the big city. Lighter in tone than later works like West Side Story or Candide, its smart combination of the different musical traditions one could hear when wandering in the streets of New-York, its accomplished orchestral writing and colouring, and its vivid sense of comedy earned it no less than five Tony awards when it premiered in 1953.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6sN9hbl58osMkWonbwQGcKoUtTL.jpg", "actors": ["Jasmine Roy (Ruth Sherwood)", "Rafa\u00eblle Cohen (Eileen Sherwood)", "Dalia Constantin (Helen)", "Lauren van Kempen (Violet)", "Alyssa Landry (Mrs Wade)", "Maxime De Toledo (Robert Baker)", "Thomas Boutilier (Wreck)", "Franck Lopez (Lonigan)", "Jacques Verzier (Appopolous / 1st Editor)", "Julian Salvia (Chick Clark)", "Jean-Yves Lange (A Client / A Policeman)", "Gr\u00e9gory Garell (A Man)", "Didier Siccardi (Policeman)", "Antoine Abello (Policeman)", "Jean Delobel (Policeman)", "Patrick Sabatier (Policeman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
