And what is \u2018crazy\u2019? Everybody attempts to convince L\u00e9a that her mother, Suzanne, is mentally ill. Her father wants to see her returned to the psychiatric clinic, but L\u00e9a refuses to see her mother in the same light: Suzanne is happy \u2013 even if she doesn\u2019t act like others expect her to. She appears to live a joyfully infantile existence after calmly letting go of life\u2019s pressures. L\u00e9a captures her mother\u2019s life on film and focuses her attention on examining the old super-8 films from the family archives. When she is left to drive her mother back to the clinic after a weekend at home, L\u00e9a grabs her opportunity: She turns the car around and whisks Suzanne off on a journey; a road trip without the judgements of others. AVANTI follows a mother-daughter relationship with an ease and depth that highlights the complexity of the emotional ties within a family.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hTdVDfepN4UyuXQGoS8p1n0XMoL.jpg", "actors": ["Hanna Schygulla (Suzanne)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
