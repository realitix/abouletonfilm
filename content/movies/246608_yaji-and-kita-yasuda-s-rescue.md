The humorous exchanges with Goro Kawabe, his senior at Nikkatsu, can be priceless, with the expressions and movements of the two goofy characters making for pure, hilarious slapstick comedy. A 15-minute remnant of the film was released on DVD by Digital Meme with benshi accompaniment by Midori Sawato and Ryubi Kato.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i5cbCCgoKisl5UNkAuYOY8dDNrJ.jpg", "actors": ["Yukiko Asano (Osaki)", "Enichiro Jitsukawa (Kimpei Harukawa)", "Takeo Katsura (Sataro Kawashima)", "K\u00f4ichi Katsuragi (Yujiro Yasuda)", "Gor\u00f4 Kawabe (Yaji)", "Midori Komatsu (Okatsu)", "Jo Kume (Gitaro Matsuda)", "Yutaka Mimasu (T\u00f4ichiro Shinohara)", "K\u00f4mei Minami (Toshizo Hijikata)", "Sh\u00f4z\u00f4 Nanbu (Yasota Sugimura)", "Shir\u00f4 Niizuma (Danroku Yamaarashi)", "Kaj\u00f4 Onoe (Tsunesuke Maehara)", "Tamitaro Onoe (Isami Kondo)", "\u00d4ka Onoe (Niimi, Gonz\u00f4)", "Yoneko Sakai (Someka)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
