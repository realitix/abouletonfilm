He finds a public phone and puts a call through to Dick Barton (Don Stannard), but before he can report, a shot rings out. Barton must piece together what Phillips found out that got him killed. Phillips had been assigned to protect Professor Mitchell (Percy Walsh) and his new development, a ray capable of exploding any unstable element aboard an aircraft in flight. Mitchell has been targeted for kidnapping by Serge Volkoff (Meinhart Maur), a foreign agent from Eastern Europe, as part of a larger, much more sinister plot to destroy England and cripple Western Europe. Complicating matters further is that Mitchell's daughter (Joyce Linden) has also been kidnapped, and Barton must contend with Volkoff's crafty female companion Anna (Tamara Desni).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6ifAzulPX8mBR9QAI0rGHkdFcOe.jpg", "actors": ["Don Stannard (Dick Barton)", "Tamara Desni (Anna)", "Meinhart Maur (Serge Volkoff)", "Joyce Linden (Mary Mitchell)", "Percy Walsh (Professor Mitchell)", "Campbell Singer (Inspector Cavendish)", "Richard George (Inspector Slade)", "Beatrice Kane (Betsy Horrock)", "George Crawford (Boris)", "Paddy Ryan (Fingers)", "Ted Butterfield (Tommy)", "Patrick Macnee (Phillips)", "Fred Owens (A Gangster)", "Yoshihide Yanai (Chang)", "John Arnatt (Jackson)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
