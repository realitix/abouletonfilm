She promotes feminism and laments a shift in the men from self-defense to aggression. Her friend, Else Lasker-Schuler (1869 - 1945), expressionist poet and German Jew, is in Berlin, writing, caring for her son, watching Hitler's movement take power. She goes to Jerusalem and imagines a park for Arab and Jew. Her poems, voiced from within, capture her experience. The film meditates on the violence at the root of Israel's birth: of the Nazis and of the Zionists.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jHcQuTUc3GYyhtfoXtPjfTMWocZ.jpg", "actors": ["Lisa Kreuzer (Else)", "Rivka Neuman (Tania)", "Markus Stockhausen (Ludwig)", "Benjamin Levi (Paul)", "Vernon Dobtcheff (Editor)", "Bernard Eisenschitz (Man in Berlin cafe)", "Raoul Guylad (Dr. Weintraub)", "Juliano Mer-Khamis (Menahme (as Juliano Mer))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
