What is often overlooked, however, is the literary importance of the Somme: more writers and poets fought in it than in any other battle in history.  Narrated by Michael Sheen, War of Words: Soldier-Poets of the Somme details the experiences of the poets and writers who served in the battle. The work of Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves, David Jones, Isaac Rosenberg and JRR Tolkien (who arrived at the Western Front with ambitions to be a poet) was informed and transformed by the battle. Taken together, their experiences allow us to see this dreadful historical event through multiple points of view.  The film uses animation, documentary accounts, surviving artefacts, battalion war diaries and the landscape itself to reconnect this literature to the events that inspired it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5fuFpXrCZFFiVIyOw5qdLWS3140.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Sheen (Narrator (voice))", "Peter Barton (Himself - First World War Historian)", "Max Egremont (Himself - Biographer, Siegfried Sassoon)", "Christophe Fricker (Himself - Literary Historian)", "John Garth (Himself - Author, Tolkien and the Great War)", "William Graves (Himself - Son of Robert Graves)", "Jean Moorcroft Wilson (Herself - Biographer, Siegfried Sassoon)", "Paul O'Prey (Himself - Editor, Selected Poems: Robert Graves)", "Jonathon Riley (Himself - Royal Welch Fusiliers)", "Jon Stallworthy (Himself - Editor, The Oxford Book of War Poetry)", "Nigel Steel (Himself - Principal Historian, Imperial War Museums)", "Michael Symmons Roberts (Himself - Poet)", "Charlotte Zeepvat (Herself - Biographer, W.N.
