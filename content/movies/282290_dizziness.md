Although the film doesn\u2019t depict the incident, she later jumped off the bridge in an attempt to kill herself. Two girls witnessed her attempted suicide, and in this film I am attempting to depict the broken state of their psyches. In this piece, various images have been generated as a result of my professional interaction with a number of young people with mental illnesses, and the unstable state of mind which I have often experienced in recent days - Takashi Ito", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w9IVBkbRW3UTbXwhQsicUKfwG3f.jpg", "actors": ["Megumi Kubo (Herself)", "Minori Takenaka (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
