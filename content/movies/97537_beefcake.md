The fiction story follows photographer and enterprising businessman Mizer, who teamed up with his mother in 1945 to film his beefy star-wannabes around his sun-drenched pool. It is here that Neil, a naive, right-off-the-bus teen is lured into using his handsome looks to become a model. The wide-eyed Neil soon learns about the world of sex and prostitution. But a police raid and ensuing criminal trial soon threaten both of the men's worlds. Interspersed with the story are rare archival footage and interviews with former co-workers, customers and models.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vhASaZKU0mogc3ZEtMvED1DQDIy.jpg", "actors": ["Daniel MacIvor (Bob Mizer)", "Carroll Godsman (Delia Mizer)", "Joe Dallesandro (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [154315, 27152, 56310], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
