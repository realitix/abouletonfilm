This has never been more obvious than in the extraordinary concert the 4 time Grammy nominee gave in the springtime of 2008 to a mesmerized New Morning audience. At the peak of his inspiration, improvising past all musical genres, Mike - superbly backed this time by brilliant drummer Dave Weckl, soulful tenor saxophonist Bob Franceschini and incredible bassist Tom Kennedy - takes his fans along into a journey of pure musical delight. Not a surprise that Mike concluded the evening by confiding, \"\"I don't want to stop! They'll probably have to wheel me off the stage\"\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pARcQ0y64sA4fPhvvfDuGFOeODR.jpg", "actors": ["Dave Weckl (Dave Weckl)", "Mike Stern (Mike Stern)", "Bob Francescini (Bob Francescini)", "Tom Kennedy (Tom Kennedy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
