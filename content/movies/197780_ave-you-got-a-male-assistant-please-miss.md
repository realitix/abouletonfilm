A wave of period details situate the film in both time and milieu. The culture of its audience, 1970s students, is evoked and displayed via a mattress on the floor, an ethnic rug, the kilim bedpsread, homebrew jars, denim clothes and by hair: long hair, facial hair - beards. The main actors are dead ringers for the infamous cover stars of Alex Comfort's The Joy of Sex, published the year before.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tRXfzcyYoNn6UdhOqCyYraOPkyn.jpg", "actors": ["Pip Springhail (Girl)", "Eelco De Jong (Boy)", "Sue Stoodwell (Female Assistant)", "John Perkins (Male Assistant)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
