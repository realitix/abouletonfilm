While in the process of shooting the fountain in 2012, Jacobs serendipitously turned his camera toward a large protest marching to Zuccotti Park in support of Occupy Wall Street. The unexpected connection gives the film new life, seamlessly moving between sensual observation and political commentary, reflection, and abstraction. Using freeze-frames, text, and 3D manipulation, Jacobs questions the contemporary conditions of socio-political struggle, its relation to aesthetics, and the labor necessary to produce both.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/49Zoz3vhdlxETIJltjsiDoqxHnQ.jpg", "actors": ["Flo Jacobs ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
