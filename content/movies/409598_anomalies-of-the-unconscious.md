It is a hand Painted and manipulated film. I also used the technique of bleaching and batiking of the film emulsion. The footage was then step printed on a J-K Optical Printer. Although similar in style to The Flickering of the Minds Eye I began to experiment more with other colors and different textures such as dried leaves and flowers, hair, insect parts, and a variety of different types of inks and paints. The sound track for this film was preformed by NEGATIVLAND.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dPZgRhV5sjIojaiOo2y992rATvm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
