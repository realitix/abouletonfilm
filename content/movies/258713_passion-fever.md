With the original dialogue a mystery, and not understanding Greek in the first place, the Grand Dame of Sexploitation simply re-invented the entire plot blissfully dubbing it away without any clue as to what was really being said, and then adding some steamy sex scenes with her own anonymous adulterers to liven things up.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pZN3bRjnnxDCVIAavnD7YSXw4og.jpg", "actors": ["Panos Kateris (Yarkos)", "Theano Ioannidou ()", "Katerina Helmy ()", "Kostas Darras ()", "Pericles Saridakis ()", "Dora Brania ()", "Eleni Anousaki ()", "Marie France ()", "Aggela Giouranti ()", "Thanasis Stiliaras ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
