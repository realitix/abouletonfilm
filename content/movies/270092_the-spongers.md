The derogatory term 'spongers' is used by British tabloid press to describe people who are dependent on welfare support, however the play presents the case of a family who really need the help of welfare support. The title sequence shows the title of the play, 'The Spongers', superimposed over a picture of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, denoting them as 'the real spongers' as Royal finances are paid by British taxpayers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rDNwj3EDucRFtliCbKd4YjroJBa.jpg", "actors": ["Christine Hargreaves (Pauline)", "Bernard Hill (Sullivan)", "Peter Kerrigan (Peter)", "Paula McDonagh (Paula)", "Gary Todd (Gary)", "Grace Allen (Grace)", "Dawn Booth (Baby Dawn)", "Angela Catherall (Jackie)", "Gertie Almond (Gertie)", "Elaine Lindsay (Mrs Johnson)", "Bernard Atha (Councillor Conway)", "Fred Pearson (Director of Social Services)", "Ina Clough (Deputy Director of Social Services)", "Donald Gee (Dr Whitehead)", "Roger Sloman (Presenting Officer at Tribunal)", "Frances Cox (Supervisor at Home)", "Josephine Antosz (Warden at Hostel)", "Lesley Nightingale (Asst Supervisor at Home)", "Marion Shakespeare (Chair of Tribunal)", "Ann Haydn-Edwards (Clerk)", "Ann Aris (Tribunal Committee)", "Len Annett (Tribunal Committee)", "Joanna Clay (Jubilee Committee Chair)", "Eileen Beldon (Jubilee Committee)", "Ken Rose (Jubilee Committee)", "Gwen Harris (Jubilee Committee)", "Joe Kenyon (Group Policy Meeting Leader)", "Barry Hart (Roads Committee Chair)", "Johnny Allen (Planning Committee Chair)", "Jack Platts (Housing Committee Chair)", "Anthony Dutton (Education Committee Chair)", "Peter Ellis (Left Wing Councillor)", "David Hatton (DHSS Clerk)", "Yvonne Nicholson (DHSS Clerk)", "Joan Peters (Social Services Committee)", "Fred Gaunt (Social Services Committee)", "Peter Lawrence (Pauline's GP)", "Phil Kernot (Bailiff)", "Gwyll Williams (Bailiff)", "Johnny Hackett (Foreman)", "Ted Carroll (Workman)", "Emrys Evans (Comedian/Club MC)", "Bill Moores (Local in Pub)", "Mick Miller (Policeman)", "Stuart Lee (2nd Policeman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
