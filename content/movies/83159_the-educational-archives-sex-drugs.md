Through the flicker of dim projector bulbs and the warble of optical soundtracks a blueprint for better living in the Atomic Age was spelled out in no uncertain terms. Now, just as you remember them, Fantoma presents this collection of sex education and drug prevention films, ranging in date from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. Some historical, some hysterical and all filled with more important misinformation than you can digest in one viewing.  Learn all about the dangers of marijuana, the perils of heavy petting, the difference between boys and girls, and the joys of menstruation.  Films include: LSD: Insight Or Insanity?, It's Wonderful Being a Girl, Narcotics: Pit Of Despair, LSD: Case Study, &amp; Marijuana (with Sonny Bono).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xvv4TcljcQxrXbH6RMIbDrdh5I6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
