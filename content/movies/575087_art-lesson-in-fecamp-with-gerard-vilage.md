G\u00e9rard and his student Laurent Abou-Haidar discuss the issues they confront as artists in their pursuit of their craft in drawing and the elusive ideas of success, time and the worth of their efforts. G\u00e9rard also demonstrates in a lesson his approach to seeing the perspective of a model/subject in space and drawing what he sees at the easel. Along with having an art lesson woven through the documentary, Art Lesson in F\u00e9camp is in itself a lesson in art and an Artist\u2019s life that goes with it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eYrBXmtA3gQDdVt2t4akZrbX298.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "LIvM8eaEYgo"}
