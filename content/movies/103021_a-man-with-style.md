Both are rather ordinary middle-aged men, far removed from any association with \u2018style.\u2019 Junichi Miyata is the more cantankerous and frustrated of the two in Ishii\u2019s oeuvre. His wife died of cancer ten years ago, leaving him with an overriding memory of a silly but hilariously acted children\u2019s song of bunnies she used to sing and two children who now, aged 18 and 19, hardly engage with him and are keen to move to university in Tokyo. He is short-tempered with them and nags them endlessly to no avail.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fVvQK389j4Q1FuSnI6soOWUunSI.jpg", "actors": ["Tomoro Taguchi (Sanada)", "Tatsuya Fujiwara ()", "Ken Mitsuishi ()", "Shota Sometani (Kota)", "Naomi Nishida ()", "Ryu Morioka ()", "Jun Abe ()", "Hikaru Yamamoto ()", "Go Ayano ()", "Yukijiro Hotaru ()", "Ryo Iwamatsu ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
