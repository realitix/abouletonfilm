The camera, which has barely touched on an everyday rural landscape, attaches itself to a wooden track to follow a breakneck route over a vertical rock face. At the end: a view of the starting point of the journey - the village! It is only a few minutes of film, but hints at an eternity, far, deep under the rock face.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rfio9VUcRcM1ned8fJHocEpr1rd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
