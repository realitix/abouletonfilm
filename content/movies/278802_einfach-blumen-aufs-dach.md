Now they have a serious transportation problem: Their Trabant is far too small for the grown family that furthermore includes two sons and a dog. Thanks to the support of a state secretary and of his brigade, Hannes acquires a Tschaika \u2013 a limousine that is normally restricted to representational purposes \u2013 for a small price. Whereas Maxi views the state carriage only as a useful means of transportation, Hannes enjoys the unusual pre-emption he is receiving for the spectacular car. Hannes, who normally is just a humble guy, starts to grate his colleagues with his new affectations. Thus, they teach him an effective lesson: They decorate the state carriage with flowers and thus bring Hannes back down to earth in a humorous way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1XS7QUg3DJzTRlnuJXsQT4RjFpd.jpg", "actors": ["Martin Trettau (Hannes Blaschke)", "Barbara Dittus (Maxi Blaschke)", "Jaecki Schwarz (Sohni Schilling)", "Carmen-Maja Antoni (Elfi M\u00fcller)", "Thomas Neumann (Wachtmeister Scheibchen)", "Hannjo Hasse (DHZ-Direktor)", "Werner Riemann ()", "Lars Jung ()", "Carl Heinz Choynski ()", "Werner Godemann ()", "Albert Hetterle ()", "Werner Lierck ()", "Peter Sturm ()", "Marianne W\u00fcnscher ()", "Ernst-Georg Schwill ()", "Achim Wolff ()", "Harald Engelmann ()", "Birgit Raatz ()", "Willi Schrade ()", "Willi Neuenhahn ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
