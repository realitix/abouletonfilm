I wasn't expecting that much from this movie. I mean Tina Fey and Steve Carell....two funny people from SNL. So I guess it's another SNL movie. Not that it's a bad thing....i know it wasn't Nights of Roxbury kind of funny. Maybe a Baby Mama kind of funny.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that it's pretty funny. not much LOLs but it has its moments. Lots of cameos of course. Mark Ruffalo, Leighton Meester, Mark Wahlberg, Will.I.Am, Mila Kunis and James Franco. Of course I was so happy when James Franco appeared. I mean, ever since I had that dream about him being my boyfriend last week, I became obsessed with him. hahaha! So thanks to him, I ended up loving the movie. lol.\r\n\r\nMy rate for this movie is B+.  I think its funnier than Baby Mama and the woman screaming in the theater just added that LMAO in this movie."}], "recommandations_id": [11665, 38778, 19899, 4964]}
