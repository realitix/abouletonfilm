There's still some things to like, and even the core message is an important one we don't see much of, plus i'm sure this will work as a movie for kids, which to be fair is its target demographic, I'm just saying I don't think I'll ever come back to see Ralph break the Internet a second time around.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"}], "recommandations_id": [324857, 260513, 166428, 299537], "youtube_key": "_BcYBFC6zfY"}
