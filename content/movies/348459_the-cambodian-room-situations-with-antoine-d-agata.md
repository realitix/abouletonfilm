After devoting himself to depicting desolated landscapes and borderline realities, D'Agata focuses his art on his intimate human relations. His latest work focuses on body and flesh, in a narrow room.  This film catches the hidden part of his art making; his choice of living on the edge and experiencing sex with extreme vitality. It is an apocalyptic and sublime journey, similar to the ones of other heretic artists of contemporary culture, from Jack Kerouac to Antonin Artaud, from Francis Bacon to Pier Paolo Pasolini.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sa9VBTxKRDGq5phtT6lXlVle83w.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
