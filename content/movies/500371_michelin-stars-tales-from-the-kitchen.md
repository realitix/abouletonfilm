Telling tales from a grand menu of culinary temples as well as digging into the greatness and flaws of Guide Michelin in this golden age of gastronomy. Because we share a great love for the industry that also includes a realistic understanding of things behind the picturesque scenes of the--perhaps--greatest, most creative and dynamic industry in the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pJStaELlCIxuS9MSUlFIMhJOezS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "cCAT4GLyV8I"}
