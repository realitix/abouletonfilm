An opportunistic entrepreneur develops a bond with a street kid trying to help him get to his business meeting in Makati, after losing his cellphone to a snatcher. A teacher from the province haggles with a former OFW, turned taxi driver, whether the country should follow world standards in basic education requirements. And a snatcher trying to reform himself with the help of a nurse by trying to return what he stole. Three stories all asking the same thing: what matters most, the collective or the individual gain?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iTFO6R64lzhH5uNsCKzVWotGvMO.jpg", "actors": ["Joem Bascon ()", "Hayden Kho ()", "John Manalo ()", "Sue Prado ()", "Simon Ibarra ()", "Lance Raymundo ()", "Mara Lopez ()", "Upeng Fernandez ()", "Allen Dizon ()", "Aljur Abrenica ()", "Kris Bernal ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "GAN0UpDKrnE"}
