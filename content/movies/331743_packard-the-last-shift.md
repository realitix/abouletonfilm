Packard closed up shop in 1954 and left the city, leaving the plant behind. Over fifty years later, it's still standing as a half-mile stretch of rubble and ruin - a visual symbol of bankrupt Detroit. Along with exploring Packard's storied past and uncertain future, the movie also looks a the plant's place in Detroit lore that draws car enthusiasts, curiosity seekers and artists from all over the world.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Celeste Headlee (Narration)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
