Ultimate is a team sport played with a flying disc. It was born in American counterculture at the end of the 60s. Now it is played all over the\r world and it is founded on fair play and Spirit of the Game. There is no referee and players call their own fouls. Following Beefree, a team from Turin, we'll find out about a game that\r could teach us a lot. Throughout the championship games, it won't miss a chance to live the original Spirit of the Game. Indeed, we'll see our players during a great hat beach tournament, on the island of Sardinia. Will Beefree be able to maintain the balance between the soul of Ultimate and the desire to win?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/853U1Wo9j881OFuV87dXUXxIvvE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
