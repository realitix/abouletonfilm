A publisher whose once-honest New York tabloid has been ideologically hijacked is aiming to make a course correction. Minutes after saying, \"The power of the press is the freedom to tell the truth--it is not the freedom to twist the truth,\" he's a dead man.

Made in mid World War II, the picture angrily and explicitly likens homegrown demagoguery to Nazism--and its condemnation of media organizations \"playing on the prejudices of stupid people\" has acquired fresh relevance.
