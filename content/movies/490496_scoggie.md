Scoggie ruminates on the hearty determination of the island people, a government scheme to develop marine farming, and a mysterious stranger who has remained Scoggie's hero since he was 14 years old. This film is a portrait of island life through the eyes of a local whose love for his home shines through in everything he does.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lCYJEQHUFX0VfRqQYhy9ifwQJzZ.jpg", "actors": ["Scoggie Watson (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
