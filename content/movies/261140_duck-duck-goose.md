Well, wait a minute... It does feature one boob named Jacob who longs to keep his ex-wife close-by for masochistic pleasure. There's also C.B., a nervous romantic with a hapless crush on an exotic burping beauty named Lizzie, who only wants to find a man with a mind like a woman, fall in love, and fly away to Paris. It's an intoxicating blend of early sixties European romp and post-modern cynicism in glorious technicolor!", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
