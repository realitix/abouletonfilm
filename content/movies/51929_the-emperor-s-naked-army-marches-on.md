Setting out to conduct interviews with survivors and relatives, he finds the truth of the past to be elusive, achieving a breakthrough only when he confronts ex-Sergeant Yamada, who grudgingly admits the occurrence and instructional source of certain atrocities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ylZlIBhsqORz1YYj91Z3BgfXldn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [112698, 178535, 110760, 52276], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
