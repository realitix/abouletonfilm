This time it\u2019s all about Moses and the Israelites\u2019 harrowing escape from Egypt. Let My People Go [Exodus] begins with the story of baby Moses being plucked from the river by Pharaoh\u2019s daughter, saved so he could grow up to lead God\u2019s people out of Egypt. He meets God in a burning bush, witnesses the miraculous parting of the Red Sea and wanders in the desert. It\u2019s there that the Lord makes a covenant with his people and gives them a new set of rules, the Ten Commandments. The book of Exodus is all about salvation and redemption \u2013 what they are and why we need them!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xifukh0x9Fc3rBbeonm2D4ezpHI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
