Some have it, some don't, and Paul, an unpredictable loner, falls into the latter category. A frustrated creative living a dead end life, Paul is at odds with everything in his environment and with himself. When he reaches out to Anna, a seemingly kindred spirit who lives across the hall, could things be changing for him? With a distinctive sharp wit and visual expression, the film explores the complexities of 21st century relationships and the fine line between acceptance of others and settling for less.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/awNAwP5ilb4LYQakDUO5CGneg1P.jpg", "actors": ["Dave Andrae (Paul)", "Victoria Nohl (Anna)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
