For generations, the lumberjacks of Heilongjiang, China have made their living harvesting timber amidst a barren, wintry landscape. These woodcutters confront the elements, living in makeshift cabins surrounded by snow and ice. Hand tools, sleds and horses are the only technology they employ to drag massive trees down the perilous slopes of Black Bear Valley. At constant risk of injury and death, they attempt to appease the mountain gods with ancient rituals and sacrifices. Despite their heroic efforts to subsist, the deforestation caused by their decades-long customs may lead to their ultimate demise.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pxZxcmQq8H1g0kLWPk24Aav0BgX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
