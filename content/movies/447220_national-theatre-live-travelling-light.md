In a remote village in Eastern Europe, around 1900, the young Motl Mendl is entranced by the flickering silent images on his father's cinematograph. Bankrolled by Jacob, the ebullient local timber merchant, and inspired by Anna, the girl sent to help him make moving pictures of their village, he stumbles on a revolutionary way of story-telling. Forty years on, Motl - now a famed American film director - looks back on his early life and confronts the cost of fulfilling his dreams. I know it was in the picture. I made the picture and now the cow's getting paid and I'm not! Following Vincent in Brixton and The Reporter, Nicholas Wright's new play is a funny and fascinating tribute to the Eastern European immigrants who became major players in Hollywood's golden age.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bvQC26xj3eVi9PLq6Y5uF4TOHVX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
