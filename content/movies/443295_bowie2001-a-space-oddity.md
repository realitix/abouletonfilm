Using Bowie\u2019s original tracks, he put together a CD and mp3 package called Bowie2001. The music was available as a free download. Also offered was a higher-quality full-length mix and a CD. To accompany the music, a free torrent of a 100-minute film was available. Called Bowie2001 - A Space Oddity, the movie rearranged visuals from Kubrick\u2019s classic 2001 and matched them with von Runte\u2019s Bowie mix.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kKgei6pEHMSEjgJpuzBsnZhoy0V.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
