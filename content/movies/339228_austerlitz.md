You don\u2019t really know why. It lies around, and then one day you open it, almost absentmindedly. And there you are, facing your own innermost secrets.\u201d  So begins Stan Neumann\u2019s cinematic adaptation of W.G. Sebald\u2019s award-winning novel, Austerlitz. The vaulted and majestic space of the railway station in Antwerp is where our journey really starts with actor Denis Lavant (Holy Motors) addressing the camera directly, and musing on the curious nature of railway stations. This bravura opening is startling, charming, and like the unnamed narrator of the book, you surrender to the proceedings and perambulate alongside Lavant, as he journeys through the great buildings of Europe, faded and shuttered hotels and grand colonnades with broken windows.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s5IhmKSETMOgolJJDFeoILTUO1N.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
