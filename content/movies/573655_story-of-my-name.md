Without photographs, without my cuddly toys and without recollections, I started a trip to the places where I grew up to rebuild that missing memory. A trip that starts in the Chilean desert and end in an island of the south. Little by little, the memory of Karin Eitel emerges, a woman arrested, tortured and interrogated on public television during the dictatorship, and to whom I owe my name. I'm looking for clues, I talk to my parents, but there is a layer of their history that I'm not allowed to go through. A secret that unites them despite being separated brings me closer to Karin Eitel\u2019s story. In the background the image of a country that with the return of democracy was built omitting its own history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y83uXNwyCUVLk6QZTsImFKcoC7o.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
