In relating their personal stories, these remarkable men and women take us back to the 1970's and 1980's, creating a vivid portrait of how a small, dedicated group tackled the seeming-impossible: the attainment of the world's first law that affirmatively recognized same-sex relationships. In doing so, they changed the very language that is used to describe same-sex relationships and created a template that spread worldwide. Their accomplishment made possible today's efforts to establish marriage equality. Their contribution is revealed in this stirring documentary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nLdAQWqkd2ivJ57XN9EvAJVQQhS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
