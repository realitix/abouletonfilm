Morakot is a derelict and defunct hotel in the heart of Bangkok that opened its doors in the 1980's: a time when Thailand shifted gears into accelerated economic industrialization and a time when Cambodians poured into Thai refugee camps after the invasion of Vietnamese forces. It was a hosting time. Later, when the East Asian financial crisis struck in 1997, these reveries collapsed. Like Kamanita, the unchanged Morakot is a star burdened with (or fueled by) memories. Apichatpong collaborated with his three regular actors, who recounted their dreams, hometown life, bad moments, and love poems, to re-supply the hotel with new memories.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9tValCjdQTACN3wv9YTeNonMEXu.jpg", "actors": ["Jenjira Pongpas ()", "Sakda Kaewbuadee ()", "Nitipong Thinthupthai ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
