{"tmdb_id": 346061, "title": "A Happy Hand", "original_title": "Een gelukkige hand", "slug_title": "a-happy-hand", "date": "2005-03-24", "genre": ["Drame"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "By alternating documentary with fiction, a portrait is drawn of Peter van Straaten, eminent draughtsman of political cartoons, the long-term Parool serial Agnes and a countless series of painfully comical sketches of everyday life. Interviews with Van Straaten - outside, at home and at work - smoothly merge with dramatised excerpts from Agnes (played by people like Ren\u00e9e Fokker, Pierre Bokma and Hans Kesting). 'That's me, dressed up as a woman', he says about this creation. The camera peeks over his shoulder when Van Straaten makes his black-and-white drawings with pen and ink. His humour is harsh; he draws people in all their spinelessness, sadness and dishonesty, with a remarkable eye to facial expressions and postures. Through his drawings and stories, he also talks about his personal experiences with alcohol, relationships, family, health and sex - and his lifelong love for birds in the open field.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v69qQX02ZmN8DMOB4kj5qNPwYJf.jpg", "actors": ["Pierre Bokma ()", "Ingeborg Elzevier ()", "Ren\u00e9e Fokker ()", "Hans Kesting ()", "Michiel Romeyn ()", "Reinout Scholten van Aschat ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
