Invited by a dippy, curator (Josephine Decker), playwright Claire (Dameka Hayes) is spirited away to an artists\u2019 retreat to present a political one-act about race, resentment, and masculinity. Accompanied by her fianc\u00e9, Monica (Carolina Monnerat), begins as a welcome getaway for the harried pair, until an unexpected visit from town enigma Mutty (Matt Shaw) casts a threatening shadow.  While Claire plays babysitter to a duo of difficult performers Joel (Brian H. Brooks) and Adam (David Malinsky) Monica attempts to maintain her sanity despite her lover\u2019s decreasing attentions and her neighbor\u2019s proximity. Each woman struggles to preserve her autonomy in an increasingly hostile milieu, building to a soul-shaking climax that offers no easy answers for character and viewer alike.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kgEq1zEIRC5p74UlDLUX6rMVIqT.jpg", "actors": ["Josephine Decker (Sarah)", "Dameka Hayes (Claire)", "Carolina Monnerat (Monica)", "Matthew Shaw (Mutty)", "Dave Malinsky (Adam)", "Brian Harlan Brooks (Joel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
