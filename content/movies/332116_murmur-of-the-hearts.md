Isabella Leong plays an uncertain painter, Mei, who drifted apart from her tour guide brother after leaving Liudau, the off-shore island of Taiwan, with their mother. Mei falls for an underachieving boxer, and begins years of soul searching in the city, where the siblings reunite under unexpected circumstances. What was remembered and forgotten are lessons that have profound consequences in this emotional drama.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zv6O5NJikb2OwERX75W5awkb6J.jpg", "actors": ["Lawrence Ko (Nan)", "Isabella Leong (Mei)", "Joseph Chang (Hsiang)", "Angelica Lee (Jen)", "Banny Chen (Father)", "Jason Wang (Boxing coach)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [287649, 97943, 8943, 283711], "youtube_key": "o-69vDmUBXk"}
