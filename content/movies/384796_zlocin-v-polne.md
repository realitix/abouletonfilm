In 1899 a dead girl - seamstress Ane\u017eka Hr\u016fzov\u00e1 - was found between the village of V\u011b\u017eni\u010dka and the town of Poln\u00e1. She was 19 and she had a cutting wound on the throat. There was no sexual violence involved and since the local doctors thought that there was not enough blood on the crime scene, everyone jumped to the conclusion that Jews must have killed her and added her blood to their passover matzot. There was a potential murderer at hand too - a cheeky, not very bright young Jewish rover, Leopold Hilsner\u2026", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/61G4FX4hwiKy9t02Q5H8UUVnlo8.jpg", "actors": ["Jaroslav Plesl (Zdeno Au\u0159edn\u00ed\u010dek)", "Karel He\u0159m\u00e1nek ml.
