While indulging in behind-the-scene shenanigans including rape and murder, the gangster (played by American Clu Gulagher) preaches to large audiences, using mass hypnotism and show-biz razzmatazz to get his message across. The film also features a brief performance by Per Oscarsson, following his highly publicized \"retirement\" from screen acting.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lngB6WMadRUkY212lmFkS3No0Ai.jpg", "actors": ["Clu Gulager (Glenn Mortenson)", "Ernst G\u00fcnther (Anders Andersson)", "Per Oscarsson (Johan Gustavsson)", "Anne-Lise Gabold (Maria)", "Ulla Sj\u00f6blom (Kristina Nordb\u00e4ck)", "Gudrun Brost (Anna Nilsson)", "Inga Tidblad (majorskan)", "Hans Alfredson (biljardhallsf\u00f6rest\u00e5ndaren)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
