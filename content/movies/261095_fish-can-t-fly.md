Finding that their strong religious convictions and faith seemed to be used against them, these are the personal stories of people who have participated in \"ex-gay\" ministries and found in fact that they did not provide a so-called cure. The answers seemed to come from within. With less of a focus on the \"ex-gay\" movement, the film is more about the telling of stories behind the debate and the role religion can play in one's life.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
