In particular the titles \u2018Castle One\u2019 and \u2018Castle Two\u2019 made symbolic reference to Kafka\u2019s book \u2018The Castle\u2019. In this book, like \u2018The Trial\u2019 the central fictitious but \u2018first-person\u2019 existential character was \u2018K\u2019 \u2013 clearly in part an oblique but intentional reference to Kafka\u2019s own name. The short video sequence used in \u2018For the Benefit of Mr. K\u2019, was shot in the little street in Prague showing the small house in which Kafka wrote \u2018The Trial\u2019. The title is also a direct reference to the song by the Beatles. The sound track is a short sequence discovered by my son of the Beatles rehearsing this song in the Abbey Road recording studio.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fHm1AuMggBCiqZLJEXpopxzzP3M.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
