Only the original copy of this film exists \u2013 it cannot be printed and is therefore projected only on rare occasions. As with other Le Grice films from the late 1960s, Spot the Microdot is marked by a radical rejection of \u2018illusionism\u2019, choosing to focus instead on the material properties of the film medium itself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9SJgBZS0rQsEerTS6ZylRszkGuQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
