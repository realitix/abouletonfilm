The battle between Boss Sukegoro of Iioka and Boss Shigezo of Sasagawa has been portrayed many times, most notably in the first Zatoichi film, where the blind man befriends the tubercular ronin Hirate Miki, before cutting him down in one of the great duels in cinema history. This all-star extravaganza pulls out all the stops, with appearances by virtually all of the great actors and actresses from Toei\u2019s studio at the time. Ichikawa Utaemon\u2019s portrayal of the kind-hearted, noble yakuza boss Shigezo of Sasagawa contrasts sharply with the devious Sukegoro of Iioka. Corrupt as he may have been, his men were all willing to give up their lives for him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rqcq7pqfHACA0CUMRFEaeBLr2mP.jpg", "actors": ["Utaemon Ichikawa (Sasagawa no Shigezo)", "Chiyonosuke Azuma (Kiyotaki no Sakichi)", "Kinnosuke Nakamura (Sunosaki no Masakichi)", "Koinosuke Onoe ()", "Kotaro Satomi ()", "Tomisabur\u014d Wakayama ()", "Sentar\u00f4 Fushimi ()", "Keiko Yukishiro ()", "Satomi Oka ()", "Keiko Okawa ()", "Hiromi Hanazono ()", "Chizuru Kitagawa ()", "Hashizo Okawa (Nadare no Iwamatsu)", "Chiez\u00f4 Kataoka (Chuji Kunisada)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
