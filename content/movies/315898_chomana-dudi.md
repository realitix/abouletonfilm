Due to his social status, he is not allowed to till his own land, something that he desires most. Though he managed to rear a pair of bullocks that he found straying in the forest, he cannot use them to till the land. He comes in contact of Christian missionaries who try to convert him giving him the lure of the land, but Choma does not want to let go of his faith. He releases the fury that fate has beset on him, by beating his drum.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h89l95LvmdHkJwXKimpRiCk32dY.jpg", "actors": ["M. V.
