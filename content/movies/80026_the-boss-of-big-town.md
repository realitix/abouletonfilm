In Boss of Big Town, veteran supporting player John Litel is top-billed as crusading city market official Michael Lynn. When a criminal gang muscles in on the local food distribution markets, Lynn vows to throw the rascals out. First, however, he pretends to join the villains as a paid government stooge, the better to find out the identity of the \"Mister Big\" behind the distribution racket. The exposure of the \"mystery villain\" will come as a shock to fans of the 1927 Cecil B. DeMille epic The King of Kings--but not to dyed-in-the-wool movie buffs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/llBRJtCchZTWlKgrbZjLG5Kr88I.jpg", "actors": ["John Litel (Michael Lynn)", "H.B.
