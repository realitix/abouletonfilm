Il\u00e9 Aiy\u00e9 uses experimental film techniques, music, and cultural observation to express the life and rituals of Candombl\u00e9 and the symbolic manifestation of the Orish\u00e1s, the deities which represent the wide range of natural and spiritual forces. The rhythms of the sacred drums and bells, a dance of spiritual ecstasy, offerings and sacrifices, divination and the visitation of the Orish\u00e1s through trance are all part of the color and life of Candombl\u00e9.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wkqsLx5YLKxBQ3wEKEuSqUHONby.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
