The film moves the focus from the game to the field's margins, to the fans, to outside the stadium. The movie intends to capture the tension, atmosphere and charm of a final match. SATELLITES translates, based on images captured during that game, the sensation of being at the stadium watching the game with no images of the game itself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/igJPfZIbsELdzhk3GOVaYlSz9iy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
