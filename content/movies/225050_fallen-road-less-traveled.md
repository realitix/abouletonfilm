While we\u2019ve always enjoyed watching and making these types of videos, there\u2019s something special about knowing what went into a project and what it was like for those who experienced it first hand. Therefore, when we set out to make the new Fallen video, we wanted to document every aspect of our missions with the goal of taking the viewer on the journey with us. Over the course of two and a half years, we traveled to Turkey, Croatia, South Africa, Portugal, the American West and Thailand. The memories alone made the extended travel and uncomfortable situations worth the effort. We invite you to join us on the Road Less Traveled.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8Hg0SL6UfoI8Ou559wBXqpQY57l.jpg", "actors": ["Brian Hansen (Brian \"Slash\" Hansen)", "Garrett Hill (Garrett Hill)", "Jack Curtin (Jack Curtin)", "James Hardy (James Hardy)", "Jamie Thomas (Jamie Thomas)", "Jon Dickson (Jon Dickson)", "Josh Harmony (Josh Harmony)", "Tom Asta (Tom Asta)", "Tommy Sandoval (Tommy Sandoval)", "Tony Cervantes (Tony Cervantes)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "nX1_OpIzpxg"}
