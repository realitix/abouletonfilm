Told in flashbacks, usually in confession to the priest, Chris sets the tone early in the opening scene where he screams oaths before the altar and smashes a religious statue in a blind rage. Whether this is before or after a 14-year-old sexpot, Joan Meyers, corners him in the church choir-loft or when the parents of a pleasure-seeking rich girl, Tury by name, catch him in bed with Tury.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1XA9u7tjvLtM0TxatkrMKaGbKR3.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Laughlin (Chris Wotan)", "Stefanie Powers (Ginny Miller)", "William Wellman Jr. (John)", "Robert Fuca (Priest)", "Linda March (Tury Martin)", "Chris Robinson (Bobby)", "Dennis O'Flaherty (Marty)", "Bob Collona (Harry)", "Roxanne Heard (Joan Meyers)", "James Stacy (Art)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
