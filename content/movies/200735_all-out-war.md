This ritual can be witnessed in any city from N.Y. to Shanghai. It's called battling, and it's the main pillar of one of modern history's most explosive subcultures: b-boying. Filmed in a fresh unique style, All Out War is a feature length documentary that follows four b-boys from different positions on the breaking spectrum. The stories of Machine, Alien Ness, Dyzee and Casper intersect at one of b-boying's most prestigious competitions: The King of the Ring.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tUeMJllckD9yimurCWVmY1iW63O.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "xMJ_RpkAH6s"}
