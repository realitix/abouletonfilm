{"tmdb_id": 205473, "title": "Fort Ti", "original_title": "Fort Ti", "slug_title": "fort-ti", "date": "1953-04-30", "genre": ["Western"], "score": "4.0/10", "synopsis": "Future horror-film entrepreneur William Castle warmed the director's chair for Fort Ti. Set in the 18th century, the film recounts the exploits of Rogers' Rangers, a band of adventurers devoted to seeking out a \"northwest passage\" through Canada. At this juncture, however, Major Rogers (Howard Petrie) is more concerned with helping the British forces at Fort Ticonderoga during a series of French and Indian raids. Top billing is bestowed upon George Montgomery as Captain Pedediah Horn, Rogers' right-hand man. The film boasts two leading ladies: Joan Vohs, as a suspected French spy, and Phyllis Fowler as a married Indian woman who falls in love with Captain Horn. Fort Ti was filmed in 3D, and in typical William Castle fashion the stereoscopic gimmick is exploited to the hilt.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7SUkaTjeE3SBAsXleSoxlKD6o20.jpg", "actors": ["George Montgomery (Capt.
