The local union, P-9 of the Food and Commercial Workers, overwhelmingly rejects a contract offer with a $2/hour wage cut. They strike and hire a New York consultant to manage a national media campaign against Hormel. Despite support from P-9's rank and file, FCWU's international disagrees with the strategy. In addition to union-company tension, there's union-union in-fighting. Hormel holds firm; scabs, replacement workers, brothers on opposite sides, a union coup d'\u00e9tat, and a new contract materialize. The film asks, was it worth it, or was the strike a long-term disaster for organized labor?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w6BbG8P7HqXJOuWx7bY76ZuXupu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
