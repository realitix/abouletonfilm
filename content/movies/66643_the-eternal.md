Devoted to his craft, Aniket met and fell in love with his wife Deepti, an actress, while they worked together on the set of a film. They were so in love that Deepti sacrificed her own career for her husband's and for their son Apratim, but lost a little of who she was in the process. The plot thickens when Aniket auditions a young actress, Shikha, who bares an uncanny resemblance to his wife when she was younger. Deepti enthusiastically begins to coach Shikha for her husband's film - so much so that Shikha becomes even more like the girl Deepti used to be and as a result the aging Aniket falls in love with Shikha, a woman as young as his son, despite the sadness and trouble it brings to his family.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aUupf4W4fEOwK4pFyIt7N7rnEfi.jpg", "actors": ["Dipankar Dey (Aniket)", "Mamata Shankar (Deepti)", "Jisshu Sengupta (Apratim)", "Ananya Chatterjee (Shikha)", "Riya Sen (Chandrika)", "Sumanta Mukherjee ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
