Amidst exotic, fanciful settings and cruel trials to conquer knowledge, amidst musical enchantment and threatening hostile forces, is the final victory of good over evil and love over hate. Singspiel in two acts to a libretto by Emanuel Schikaneder, the Zauberfl\u00f6te is one of the Salzburg genius\u2019 last masterpieces, which he probably began composing in May 1791, not even six months before his death. The opera had its debut in Vienna on 30 September 1791, conducted by the composer himself and with Schikaneder as Papageno.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eJE5YyOj4lZS6sX4ejRzWyIOnCZ.jpg", "actors": ["Antonio Poli (Tamino)", "Ekaterina Sadovnikova (Pamina)", "Alex Esposito (Papageno)", "Goran Juric (Sarastro)", "Olga Pudova (The Queen of the Night)", "Caterina Di Tonno (Papagena)", "Antonello Manacorda (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
