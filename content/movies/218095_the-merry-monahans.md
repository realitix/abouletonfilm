During the first two decades of the 20th century the film concerns a family vaudeville troupe headed by patriarch Pete Monahan (Jack Oakie). Because of his love affair with the bottle, Pete manages to get himself and his family blacklisted from every major vaude house in the country. Though Pete's kids Jimmy (Donald O'Connor) and Patsy (Peggy Ryan) love their dad, they're forced to break away from the act and go off on their own to survive. Eventually, the whole gang is reunited in a shamelessly lachrymose musical finale. Producer-scripters Michael Fessier and Ernest Pagano, whose other works include such offbeat comedies as San Diego I Love You, Frontier Gal and That's the Spirit, manage to keep the proceedings relatively clich\u00e9-free, though it's an uphill climb.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kHb6nLAOekFqiO3QLFDkGZ26kgr.jpg", "actors": ["Donald O'Connor (Jimmy Monahan)", "Peggy Ryan (Patsy Monahan)", "Jack Oakie (Pete Monahan)", "Ann Blyth (Sheila DeRoyce)", "Rosemary DeCamp (Lillian DeRoyce)", "John Miljan (Arnold Pembroke)", "Isabel Jewell (Rose)", "Gavin Muir (Weldon Laydon)", "Marion Martin (Soubrette)", "Ian Wolfe (Clerk)", "Robert Homans (Policeman)", "Lloyd Ingraham (Judge)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
