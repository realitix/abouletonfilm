As jazz became more prevalent and expansive, the characteristic \"hard bop\" of the Messengers became accepted as the global definition for Jazz music. Art Blakey, its eldest and most eloquent exponent was its master. This brilliant performance at Ronnie Scott's in London from February 21st 1985 is testament to this fact.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/90m3EKkE9L2a7KIdqktigkVglbz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
