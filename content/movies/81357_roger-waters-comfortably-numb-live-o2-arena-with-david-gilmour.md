During the performance of 12 May 2011 at the London O2 Arena, David Gilmour appeared as a guest during this song, and both sang the choruses and played guitar from the top of the wall, echoing the original Earls Court performances.[18] The song contains one of the show's most memorable moments, when at a specific point in the final guitar solo, Waters runs to the wall, pounding it with his fists, triggering an explosion of colour in the previously dark grey projections.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xJVf4tISaJON4zaVLbOVEufrDX1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
