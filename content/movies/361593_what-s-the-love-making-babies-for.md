Collapsing footage appropriated from television, the Internet, and pop culture, Trecartin and his elaborately costumed collaborators manufacture an alien yet familiar reality. Inside this startling new video world, technophile gods wearing acid-washed denim argue about the future of gender and produce cryptic TV commercials. In a surreal backyard town meeting, characters deliver disjointed polemics assembled from clashing phrases that could have originated in ad campaigns, instant messaging conversations, or twisted episodes of syndicated science fiction. Constructed from the raw material of disposable media clich\u00e9s and fads, Trecartin's narrative leaves us to answer the riddles he poses.  Lizzie, Brian, Nick, Alison, Ben, Lyndsay, Will, Muffy, Asher, Rhett, Kenny, Ryan. -- Electronic Arts Intermix", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
