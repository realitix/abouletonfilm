Pablo is a typical teen, with a fondness for football and sneaking beers with his buddies. He enjoys a comfortable upper-middle class life with his mother (Assumpta Serna), a successful lawyer and former feminist rabble-rouser, but has a gaping hole at the core of his identity: he has no idea who his father is. Preoccupied with the question to the point of obsession, he sets out in search of answers, and finds himself on a trail that leads to the Canary Islands.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uzcL5NlxafTVkNCHBg3GwSJi6C1.jpg", "actors": ["Santiago Ramos ()", "Assumpta Serna ()", "Eloy Azor\u00edn ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
