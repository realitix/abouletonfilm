The husbands are all for this as they think it will cure their wives of being infatuated with this man-about-town. And they might run into some fun in Paris. Actually, the philanderer is the one who put the idea in their heads to go away so the coast will be clear for his marauding raid party, with no intentions of curing anybody of anything.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3S7oagmtZyW3e3HC0S8ekt9Wpnc.jpg", "actors": ["Rex Harrison (Leonard Drummond)", "Diana Churchill (Marion Carter)", "June Clyde (Diana Cheswick)", "Henry Kendall (Geoffrey Carter)", "Romney Brent (Morgan Cheswick)", "Roxie Russell (Kate)", "Richard Goolden (Whittaker)", "Phil Thomas (Chauffeur)", "Judith Gick (Joan)", "Joan Kemp-Welch (Maid)", "Clive Baxter (Boy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
