Through a combination of silence, the everyday gestures of this woman and the films that are projected from her living room, comes a film built like a day in Sena\u2019s life. Through the films that Sena projects, we are taken on a journey in both collective and personal memory. The film offers a portrait of intimacy crossed with a history witnessed by cinema; a history which Sena has conserved.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i7ngDQ0tNdiaRwMIbTvDC0QEOcm.jpg", "actors": ["Nur \u0106ori\u0107 ()", "Dragan Kosti\u0107 ()", "Sena Mujanovi\u0107 ()", "Sa\u0161a Skoko ()", "Tija Zubanovi\u0107 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
