Paul meets Maggie Mutt, and Paul, being a pedigree canine and somewhat of a cad, lures trusting Maggie to the barn to have his way. He then departs for his palatial doghouse at the Livingston estate. Meanwhile Maggie is broken-hearted and also finds that she is in a \"family way\", and gives birth to a pup she names Hank. Maggie tells Hank to find his \"human \", and departs the scene. Hank goes to the park, meets a \"human\" named Mary Kelly, who is a homeless waif and sweetheart of poverty, and the two adopt each other. Later on in the park Paul comes strolling along with his 'human', John. A child falls into the lake and Paul and Hank team up to save her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3guABTjOg3reeLsInn2BjzB0Ixu.jpg", "actors": ["Vera Reynolds (Mary Kelly)", "Kenneth Thomson (John Livingston)", "Ethel Wales (Katie)", "Majel Coleman (Cecile Adams)", "Claire McDowell (Mrs. Livingston)", "Fred Walton (Doctor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
