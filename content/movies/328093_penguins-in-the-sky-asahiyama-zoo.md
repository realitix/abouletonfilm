The unpopular zoo welcomes a new zoo keeper, young Yoshida (Yasuhi Nakamura), who has more affection for insects than people after years of being bullied at school when he was young. Yoshida soon realizes that Asahiyama Zoo is facing a financial crisis and the zoo director Takizawa (Toshiyuki Nishida) has been doing everything in his power to save the zoo from closing down.  Moved by Takizawa's passion, Yoshida and other zoo keepers came to share the zoo director's belief that one's dreams can come true, and together they tackle this seemingly impossible task of revitalizing Asahiyama. A breakthrough arrives in the form of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Behavioral Exhibition,\u00e2\u20ac a method that is pioneered by Ashiyama's zoo keepers and which eventually makes the zoo renowned throughout the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/65bscqSG3lrxRfi2wPRLXXhrGpN.jpg", "actors": ["Toshiyuki Nishida (Kanji Takizawa)", "Yasuhi Nakamura (Tsuyoshi Yoshida)", "Ai Maeda (Makoto Ogawa)", "Keiko Horiuchi (Sanae Ikeuchi)", "Naomasa Musaka (Teruo Mitani)", "Sansei Shiomi (Genta Tobe)", "Ittoku Kishibe (Seinosuke Yanagihara)", "Akira Emoto (Itsuro Usui)", "Hiroyuki Nagato (Keisuke Nirasaki)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
