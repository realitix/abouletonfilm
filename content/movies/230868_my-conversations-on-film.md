Jonas Mekas, Jean-Pierre Gorin, Robert Kramer and many other visionaries and mavericks of the silver screen \u2013 as well as a book seller, a critic and a psychoanalyst \u2013 discuss what cinema has meant to them, what it is and what it could be and, implicitly, how it has changed over the 18 years in which this film was shot. Director Boris Lehman leads the charge, drawing in moments of absurdist humour and inventive camera work; he keeps things raw and spontaneous. His encounters with the now much-missed Jean Rouch and Stephen Dwoskin are particularly touching and stand testament to their personal playfulness and candour. An engaging, absorbing, epic odyssey of a movie.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g7aRipOHY2mL7dGAlFisMSlMMH0.jpg", "actors": ["Fran\u00e7ois Alb\u00e9ra (Himself)", "Jean-Marie Buchet (Himself)", "G\u00e9rard Courant (Himself)", "Dimitri Declercq (Himself)", "Stephen Dwoskin (Himself)", "Daniel Fano (Himself)", "Jean-Pierre Gorin (Himself)", "Marcel Hanoun (Himself)", "Robert Kramer (Himself)", "Patrick Leboutte (Himself)", "Boris Lehman (Himself)", "Jonas Mekas (Himself)", "Serge Meurant (Himself)", "Dominique Noguez (Himself)", "Dominique Pa\u00efni (Himself)", "David Perlov (Himself)", "Luc Remy (Himself)", "Fabrice Revault d'Allones (Himself)", "Jean Rouch (Himself)", "Philippe Simon (Himself)", "Henri Storck (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
