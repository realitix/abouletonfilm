The elemental vicissitudes of the weather, the exact moment of the day, the colour of the light and the soil and the trees form an acute visual record of the constantly changing mood of the landscape. The film successfully attempts, with quiet, passionate, almost single-minded firmness, to confront us as nakedly as possible with our cultural inability to see nature whole, without preconceptions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yMJWhjVPGgp6mDZwhNG1zDO5Ur0.jpg", "actors": ["Babette Mangolte (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
