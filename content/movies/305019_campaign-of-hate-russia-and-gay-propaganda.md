Antigay sentiment and legislation are spreading rapidly throughout the country. In 2013, the Russian parliament passed a ban on so-called 'gay propaganda' that effectively makes nearly any public discussion of gay equality a crime. It is my hope that this documentary will educate viewers to their reality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sloMm1mCJbp73RoIOvM4yUu1ZmA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
