Robert Lepage then embarks on the creation of Kanata, a work that imagines the meeting of Europeans with First Nations people in Canada over two centuries. Lepage au Soleil: The origin of Kanata shows how, the 36 comedians from 11 different countries, discover in their own stories astonishing resonance with those of the natives. How, inspired by the cosmopolitanism of comedians, Robert Lepage tries to get them to talk about their own stories through those of the natives. The documentary plunges into the heart of a theatrical creation in search of universality turned upside down by a media scandal even before its premiere.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vRBTb6t49iBL3N8nyGE4gAwxn5x.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Lepage (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
