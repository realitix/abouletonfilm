Danny escapes his grim life in suburban Australia and blasts into the skies in a chair tied with helium balloons. A mighty thunderstorm blows him clean off the map, and spits him out far away over the lush green town of Clarence. In this new town, he rockets into the world of Glenda, the town's only parking cop. While the media back home becomes obsessed with the story of his disappearance, Danny gets to reinvent himself in this new town, and in his great adventure, he discovers a true soul mate in Glenda. Fate catches up with him eventually, as Danny's true identity is revealed and Trudy--now a tabloid celebrity--comes to the idyllic town to claim Danny and drag him back to Sydney. Danny, however, is a changed man; he's discovered what it means to be happy and has found a new self-worth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iI7zy6y9LyT4zpc1RNVFtmYckFG.jpg", "actors": ["Rhys Ifans (Danny Morgan)", "Miranda Otto (Glenda Lake)", "Justine Clarke (Trudy Dunphy)", "Rhys Muldoon (Sandy Upman)", "John Batchelor (Pete)", "Alan Flower (Ray Vitali)", "Julie Sobotta (Kate (as Jules Sobotta))", "Brian Langsworth (Real Estate Agent)", "Steve Rassios (Real Estate Agent (as Steven Rassios))", "Madeleine James (Real Estate Agent)", "Jane Ruggiero (Donna)", "Gina Bortolin (Helen Costas)", "Duncan Young (Phil Stubbs)", "Garrie Scott (Party Shop Assistant)", "Richard Johnson (Passerby)", "Dina Gillespie (Kaz)", "Rod Zuanic (Bob)", "Ross Perrelli (Young Bobby)", "Victoria Nucifora (Young Lisa)", "Gyton Grantley (Stuey)", "Amie McKenna (Tina)", "Colin Angus (Elderly Neighbour)", "Yanna Black (Police Operator)", "Maeve Byrne (Police Operator)", "Peter Eyers (Police Operator)", "Victoria Karozis (Police Officer)", "Paul Wilson (Air Traffic Controller)", "Danny Nash (Air Traffic Controller)", "Keith Agius (Police Officer)", "Andrew Crabbe (Reporter - Kevin)", "Richard Healy (Reporter - Wiry)", "Sean McKenzie (Reporter - Matt)", "Peter Cook (Reporter - Troy)", "Anthony Phelan (Jim Craig)", "Nadia Townsend (Linda Craig)", "Alex Mann (Sandra Craig)", "Maggie Dence (Meredith Butcher)", "Frank Magree (Sergeant Dave)", "Peter Fisher (Fire Captain Robbo)", "Jack Carty (UFO Teenager)", "Michelle Boyle (Louella)", "Phillip Monoghan (Fireman)", "Jane Beddows (Regina Carter)", "Jasmina Singh (Indian Sister)", "Rajpreet Singh (Indian Sister)", "Paviterjeet Singh (Indian Sister)", "Michelle Collins (Checkout Lady)", "Lester Morris (Mr. Potts)", "Shar Grover (Bus Stop Woman)", "Jeanette Cronin (Maggie Pike)", "Nick Holland (In the Morning Presenter (as Nick Holland))", "Marie Patane (In the Morning Presenter)", "Stephen Holt (Nobbie Furco)", "Angus King (Darren Kehole)", "Simon Mills (Old Codger)", "Tassa Behan (Teenager)", "Karen Pang (Sonya Tims)", "Kathryn Dagher (Debby Lleyton)", "Michael Barnacoat (Dick Lleyton)", "Martin Lewis (Macadamia Ball Man)", "Rohan Seinor (Macadamia Ball Man)", "Guy Leslie (Brownie)", "Nino Alessi (Wazza)", "Todd Hodgson (Simo)", "Dane Carson (Newsreader)", "Amanda Wenban (Newsreader)", "Julia Zemiro (Effusive Woman)", "Lloyd Thomas (Reporter)", "Stephen Hobb (Polesitter)", "Warwick Moss (Wing Commander Matthews)", "Ken Porter (Howard the Boss)", "Owen Buik (Cement Man)", "David McCubbin (News Director)", "Serge Cockburn (Max Pike)", "William David Thompson (John Purchie)", "Pam Singh (Indian Mother)", "Leanna Brockenshire (Aus 11 Receptionist (as Leanne Brockenshire))", "Paul Eden (Aus 11 Cameraman)", "Peter Franks (Helicopter Pilot)", "Leon Fryer (Reporter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [83330, 116008, 44900], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
