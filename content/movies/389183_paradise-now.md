Made on videotape, with expressionist colouring 'injected' by electronic means, this emerges as a hypnotic transmutation of a theatrical event into poetic cinema, capturing the ambiance and frenzy of the original.  No documentary record could have done it justice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lTs5xMlIIDoiFRN7Q0N3HnMClrB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
