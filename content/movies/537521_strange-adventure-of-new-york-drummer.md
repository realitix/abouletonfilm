The hall boy shows him to his room, puts down his grips, and then disappears through the ceiling. Drummer pushes button five times for a drink, and waiter appears through the floor. Drummer turns to sit down on the bed it disappears. He fights with the waiter, is overcome, and waiter locks him in a trunk and sits on it. After a while he opens the trunk; behold, it's empty. Drummer appears mysteriously, picks up a big book, hits waiter on head, and drives him through the floor. Drummer dances in delirious glee.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
