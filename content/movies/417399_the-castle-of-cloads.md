He walks to Helsinki, returns to his parents' home and his old high school filled with angry radical teens who, typically for the era, consider the teacher-imposed discipline as another form of capitalist imperialism. Almost reluctantly Erik drifts together with Annika, a girl from a wealthy family, and starts experimenting with sex and marijuana. In the same nonchalant manner Erik gets involved in demonstrations and school politics which escalate into a violent school strike leading to police intervention and heavy sanctions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6Pw3caoTlLAzCMtxr9TLNo0jzwu.jpg", "actors": ["Erik Uddstr\u00f6m (Erik Saarinen)", "Meri Oravisto (Annika)", "Ritva Laatto (Annika's Mother)", "Raiku Kemppi (Erik's Mother)", "Ture Junttu (The Principal)", "Kauko Helovirta (Annika's Father)", "Martti Romppanen (Erik's Father)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
