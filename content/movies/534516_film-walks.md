What does the place where you live mean to you? Who lives next-door? In the summer of 2017, 140 people who live on and around Rosa-Luxemburg Platz in Berlin's 'Mitte' district were interviewed. These conversations were turned into a series of short films that provide personal insights into diverse lives. Behind each door there's a different story: long-standing Mitte dwellers, founders of start-ups, centenarians, globetrotters, those pining for the old East Germany, and students. There are people who have lived here for two months or sixty years; people who grew up in what used to be East or West Germany, in Latin America, Russia, or former Yugoslavia. A neighborhood full of diversity and contradictions. Some call it their home, others just the place they live, while still others think of it as a real neighborhood or 'kiez'. And yet, memories and emotions associated with this place connect them all as neighbors.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cHUtMhfnnG3uy8g0wtNQCkbMz0P.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
