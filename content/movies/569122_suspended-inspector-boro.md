A Superintendent of Police asks him to unofficially track down a girl named Sabrina Rai who has been missing for four days. While investigating, he learns that someone had taken her from her village to Guwahati city under the pretext of training her for the hospitality industry. While trying to track her down, Inspector Boro finds that her phone is switched off and she is missing from her hostel. He then heads to Guwahati and punches and kicks his way to the uncomfortable truth - Sabrina might have been entangled in a trafficking ring run by a corrupt policeman.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uw4WUFsco8okikbUwjhHdrCg3e6.jpg", "actors": ["Utkal Hazowary (Inspector Boro)", "Kenny Basumatary (Inspector Lokhi Madan Jwala)", "Suneet Bora (DSP Konwar)", "Poonam Gurung (Sabrina Rai)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "kiPG6xXH9Xs"}
