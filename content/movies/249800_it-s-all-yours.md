Barnes and in five years the extravagant escapes of Jimmy, now a lawyer, are the talk of San Francisco. Linda Gray is a mouse-like secretary to the elder Barnes who has fallen in love with Jimmy, but he favors actress Constance \"Connie\" Marlowe. Mr. Barnes dies and leaves everything to Linda but he has urged his partner, Alexander Duncan, to plan things so that Jimmy and Linda will get married. Coached by Duncan, Linda accepts the inheritance and announces that she is departing for New York on a wild spending spree. He tells Jimmy that the will can be broken but only after many months and he suggests that Jimmy follow Linda and curb her spending or there won't be any money left. In New York, Linda hires Jimmy as her private secretary. Connie also arrives in New York, as does the ingenious Baron Rene de Montigny with the intention of marrying the wealthy Miss Gray.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gr8awSIsj1gto9dNfFVlPnG1AEL.jpg", "actors": ["Madeleine Carroll (Linda Gray)", "Francis Lederer (Jimmy Barnes)", "Mischa Auer (Baron Rene de Montigny)", "Grace Bradley (Constance Marlowe)", "Victor Kilian (City Clerk)", "George McKay (License Clerk)", "Charles Waldron (Alexander Duncan)", "J.C.
