He has to carry out a mission and return to his unit immediately. However, he runs into Armando, a former schoolmate. The guitarist Armando is genuinely overjoyed. He throws back a glass or two, plies his friend with questions, and indulges in memories. Yanko's heart is torn between conflicting emotions: Should he kill Armando and thus avoid the risk of detection? On the other hand, should he take a chance and spare his onetime friend? In a moment of lucidity, Armando realizes the tight spot that he is in. He offers the partisan his own, better clothes and wishes him god luck. Just when Armando is at his happiest, the police, who have mistaken him for the outlaw they want, shoot him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q1rfknRu1jEgGnfyT0ubpGidlvL.jpg", "actors": ["Konstantin Kotsev ()", "Asen Georgiev ()", "Evstati Stratev ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
