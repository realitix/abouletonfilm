The rest of his little time he shares with his sweet wife. Then one sudden day death comes to his spouse. A whole life of stability crashes. Neither his adolescent daughter nor his dear books are of any help. Loneliness and indifference overrun his life and Mati plots his suicide. A strange 60-year- old wayfarer, Sass, who travels with a backpack of books and frequents public libraries to read the newspapers, brings forth a change. Bit by bit he starts to provide Mati with an interest in life again. \"A Friend of Mine\" is a warm expression of solitude and friendship, which helps us to overcome the bleakest periods of life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1EiK82BUG0Bnq9ksOjgJ6AQ5EK3.jpg", "actors": ["Aarne \u00dcksk\u00fcla (Mati)", "Aleksander Eelmaa (Sass)", "Harriet Toompere (Mari)", "Rita Raave (Ruth)", "Ingmar-Erik Kiviloo (Karl)", "Markus Luik (T\u00f5nn)", "T\u00f5nu Oja (Doctor)", "Sulev Teppart (Psychatrist)", "Indrek Kalda (Bus driver)", "Raivo Adlas (Head Doctor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
