Criterion presents a sampling of her stunning craft, all collaborations with television arts-programming pioneer Nathan Kroll. A Dancer\u2019s World (1957), narrated by Graham herself, is a glimpse into her class work and methodology. Appalachian Spring (1958) and Night Journey (1961) are two complete Graham ballets, the first a celebration of the American pioneer spirit, scored by Aaron Copland, the second a powerfully physical rendering of the Oedipus myth. These are signature Graham works and tributes to the art of the human body.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eKTZ6ok4Eu3Ty7ms4Xf9N5FGhsA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
