A 14 year old girl. This is the story of Mignon \"Mossie\" Van Wyk, my older sister. Oh and her best friend Adriaan Prinsloo, who I think she should marry. But that's just me. For some weird reason Mossie falls in love with older guys - enter Leon Rossouw - obviously without a shirt.  This is a story about love, naturally, but it's more about being a teenager and how rough life can be. It's a story about monsters and running shoes.  About letting go and holding on.  About friendship.  It's a story about my sister and how she learns to fly.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oADhWMnIHpb8REHnenhUoMuhkMz.jpg", "actors": ["Tanika Fourie (Mignon 'Mossie' van Wyk)", "Deanre Reiners (Adriaan Prinsloo (as De\u00e0nr\u00e9 Reiners))", "Kiara Fourie (Luna van Wyk)", "Devon Hofmeyr (Leon Rossouw)", "Paul du Toit (Johan van Wyk)", "Elzette Maarschalk (Yvonne Prinsloo)", "Johan Scholtz (Henk Prinsloo)", "Erica Wessels (Nicola Prinsloo)", "Izel Bezuidenhout (Charlene Fourie)", "Marlee van der Merwe (Lize van Wyk)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ejzK8HMqnG0"}
