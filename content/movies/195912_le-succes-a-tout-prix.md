Rodak is in the throes of putting together a major show about Poland and the politics of exile at a West End theater. His single-minded determination to succeed causes him to take advantage of others, and because of his need for backing, he turns to a low-life businessman (John Hurt) to bail him out. His wife is anything but happy about his behavior and dislikes this last decision even more. This is an interesting study of how a father and son become alienated in a conflict between cultural identity and its exploitation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jIVaAWwU9yqF4Y5TsdpxiRDdgYM.jpg", "actors": ["Michael York (Alex Rodak)", "John Hurt ()", "Anouk Aim\u00e9e ()", "Michel Piccoli ()", "Michal Skolimowski ()", "J\u00f3zef Skolimowski ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
