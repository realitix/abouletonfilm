Through his roles in film and theater, he has reflected all the periods, all the historical collusions of the Soviet Union. He has interpreted more than three hundred roles, from the simple peasant to the leaders and emperors. Being laureate of all state awards, rewarded with orders and medals, cherished by power, being himself in power, he could not \"be bronze\". Our film is about an actor and a remarkable man: Mikhail Alexandrovich Ulyanov.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uB7TBp28ZzObgLx261lP5xCMo0m.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
