As the band is probably never going to perform in this line-up again, \"Focul Viu\" is a must-have for every fan of Negura Bunget who didn't have a chance to witness the band live before their split. \"Focul Viu\" is available as DVD, 2CD, and as a box-set including both formats.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mXLtFpPmw4P4ezYjxSQFtwjaq3Q.jpg", "actors": ["Negur\u0103 Bunget ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
