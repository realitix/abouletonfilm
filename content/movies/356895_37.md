{"tmdb_id": 356895, "title": "37", "original_title": "37", "slug_title": "37", "date": "2016-11-17", "genre": ["Drame"], "score": "5.0/10", "synopsis": "On a March night in 1964, 37 neighbors in Queens, New York, witness the brutal murder of Kitty Genovese. None of them takes action or calls the police. 37 tells the story of a few of these people and what led up to the night when they unexplainably remained passive observers. The film is a convincing portrayal of a borough in change and a time characterized by racism, the Civil Rights Movement and political shifts. The actual event that inspired the film\u2019s plot has been called a symbol for the moment when America lost its innocence. The director Puk Grasten skillfully weaves into her feature film debut various fates, dreams and family conflicts by leading us through an apartment building that comes to bear a collective failure.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yNQvmwsfBzVfHbKtnISw1RuwWXF.jpg", "actors": ["Christina Brucato (Kitty Genovese)", "Michael Potts (Archibald Smith)", "Maria Dizzia (Mary Cunningham)", "Jamie Harrold (Bob Cunningham)", "Thomas Kopache (George Bernstein)", "Adrian Martinez (Gonzales)", "Samira Wiley (Joyce Smith)", "Lucy Martin (Florel Bernstein)", "Don Puglisi (Sam)", "Mario Israel (Winston Moseley)", "Sophia Lillis (Debbie Bernstein)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [336992, 317945, 270648, 380683], "youtube_key": "BaY-Bafjngw"}
