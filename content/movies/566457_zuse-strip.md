This work is a correspondence of two information fragments of different origins and times that met by accident. Cinema transforms into a three-dimensional landscape--utilizing data that is based on an archaeological misinterpretation. Zuse Strip is named after Konrad Zuse\u2019s first digital computer. It used discarded 35mm movie film from the German UFA as a medium to read and write 8-bit binary code data with a hole-punch system. The work was inspired by Lev Manovich's text \u201cCinema by Numbers\u201d, as well as \u201cThe Deciphering of Linear B\" by linguist/archaeologist John Chadwick.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xDiACRZfiX0mILWc0NDttVNGPx9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
