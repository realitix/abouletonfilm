This is an experimental communication format used between pairs of film directors. Although each director is situated in a location geographically distant from that of their partner, they are united by their willingness to share ideas and reflections on all that motivates their work. Within this space of freedom, the directors featured in the exhibition examine their affinities and differences, within an environment of mutual respect and simultaneity of interests and with notable formal variants established in each of the correspondences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4nuzEcFWQHf0xoikaFYy9q0snIX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
