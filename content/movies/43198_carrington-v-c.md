He decides to act on his own defence at his court martial hearing, his argument being that he is owed a lot of money from the army for his various postings that have cost him out of his own pocket. To further complicate the proceedings, Carrington alleges he told his superior, the very disliked Colonel Henniker, that he was taking the money from the safe. A mans career, his marriage, and quite a few reputations, all hang in the balance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4XrFKfzdui8yW2eWJhkrvVhfq5t.jpg", "actors": ["David Niven (Major Charles Carrington)", "Margaret Leighton (Valerie Carrington)", "Noelle Middleton (Captain Alison Graham)", "Allan Cuthbertson (Lt.
