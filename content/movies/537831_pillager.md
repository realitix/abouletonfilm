This was a fairly disgusting space with dirt floors and four-foot ceilings from which the leaking guts of the operation above hung down, but it was open, and I could stretch out full 100' foot rolls of film from end to end on the floor. From there, I could freely apply developers, bleaches and fixers in whatever ways I could think of, usually mashing in the dust, leaves, and garbage that was kicked up in the process.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iktCu2SbUdugdmfz92w0b6eCClf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
