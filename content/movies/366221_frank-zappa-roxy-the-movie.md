An unparalleled Composer and Guitarist, Zappa redefined rock n roll paradigms by introducing into the mix his favorite influences from classical music, jazz, blues, doowop, traditional and non-traditional music. And he did so with unparalleled humor and audacity. But it was the music itself that influenced generations of musicians and, quite frankly, blew minds. Roxy: The Movie, filmed over three nights in December 1973, at the Roxy Theatre in Hollywood, CA, is a powerful display of this experience, and reveals what made him such a pioneering musical revolutionary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1vsOS7cXHdO0j79H1VhFv0sIVV2.jpg", "actors": ["Frank Zappa (Himself)", "George Duke (Himself)", "Napoleon Murphy Brock (Himself)", "Tom Fowler (Himself)", "Bruce Fowler (Himself)", "Ruth Underwood (Herself)", "Chester Thompson (Himself)", "Ralph Humphrey (Himself)", "Pamela Des Barres (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "YPIwdlnoKyA"}
