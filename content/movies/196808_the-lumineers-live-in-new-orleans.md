The Lumineers have that stomp-and-clap acoustic, heart-on-the-sleeve kind of sound.  They've attracted devout fans, young, old and in-between who are drawn to their Americana-inflected sound in the vein of the Avett Brothers and Mumford &amp; Sons and their slow, sultry ballads that suggest the raw revelations of Jeff Buckley and Ryan Adams.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ivED7iobgzYwtesmfkEMl3Oh4kp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
