We see film stock blister; drawn square shapes appear. Then, we see an infant's face. The images of struggling climber, baby, blurred film stock, large snow flakes, and what may be microscopic details of matter are superimposed on each other, one dominating the frame briefly to be replaced by another. As the man falls in the snow and tries to regain his feet, the baby continues to appear, first with eyes closed. Alternately, images rush by - montages of paper cutouts and life under a microscope.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f42jSZw0ey8TpFGKqcnHE82GxHn.jpg", "actors": ["Stan Brakhage ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [127320, 127323, 126692, 85110], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
