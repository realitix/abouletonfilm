In old-fashioned black and white, these faces stare into the empty space, in the 5:00 PM tiredness and mechanical impersonality, like faces from the grave. It's hard to believe that these faces belong to people today. The film is one of the strongest and grimmest comments upon the contemporary society that cinema has produced.\" - Jonas Mekas, The Village Voice", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tz6kBdrZlcIvHzOvhFqZ5oDfA7W.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [122479, 199826, 209744, 209754], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
