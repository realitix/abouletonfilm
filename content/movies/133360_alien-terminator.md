But when one of those experiments goes awry, it unleashes a nearly immortal organism--one capable of instant regeneration, and with an insatiable appetite for living flesh. Soon, nothing can contain the creature, and with the lab's life support systems quickly shutting down, the scientists grimly prepare for their final battle...  A small group of scientists are working in self-imposed isolation below the Earth's surface. They are all working to create DNA which could change the world, but one of the scientists have been given an secret assignment, and when the assignment goes wrong, all hell breaks lose. The new creation is now aboard the ship and will destroy anyone who gets in its way, as it moves towards the surface.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9snpbaIprFQZFDlL65iXVTMhkpy.jpg", "actors": ["Maria Ford (McKay)", "Rodger Halston (Dean Taylor)", "Lisa Boyle (Rachel (as Cassandra Leigh))", "Emile Levisetti (Pete)", "Bob McFarland (Coach)", "Kevin Alber (Newton)", "Betsy Baldwin (Kelly Hill)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [61031, 99062, 78375, 104205], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
