The Pram was a \u2018scene\u2019, a 24-hour happening, a radical alternative to the mainstream. Those who lived and worked at the Pram expected the world to come to them - and for a while it did. (The building was eventually demolished to make way for a supermarket.)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kFznqXwbrjhcgAFlcQeIR6oVRyU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
