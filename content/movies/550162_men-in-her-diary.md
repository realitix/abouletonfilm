But she does keep a diary that contains some fact and many fictional entries. One such is read by the wife of her boss who promptly sues for a divorce. Virginia Grey stars in a musical produced by Hall and sings (possibly dubbed) \"Makin' a Million\" and \"Keep Your Chin Up.\" No spoiler to add that Ryan gets a boyfriend and Hall and Allbritton are reunited before this one runs it course.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6mGDVDWw8HGSpDzxh7iRwRuLMaW.jpg", "actors": ["Peggy Ryan (Doris Mann)", "Jon Hall (Randolph Glenning)", "Louise Allbritton (Isabel Glenning)", "Ernest Truex (Vernon Williams)", "Virginia Grey (Diana Lee)", "William Terry (Tommy Burton (as William W.
