Cecil Hepworth's 1909 film is the first of many taken in this tract of ancient woodland. The proximity to film studios - Pinewood, Shepperton and Bray - make this a favoured spot for filming. But before the studios were there, the Hepworth Company produced this extraordinary 'stereo scenic' - intended as a filmic equivalent of Victorian stereo cards. This is one of a series of tourist attractions filmed by Gaston Quiribet in a long panning shot from a car, to suggest the glorious photography and aesthetic experience of stereoscopy.  -BFI", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oAaU2vCQa9jqjMNumiXiapGpjax.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
