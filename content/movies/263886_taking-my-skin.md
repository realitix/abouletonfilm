Taking My Skin tracks a dialogue between the artist and her mother. Their exchange ranges from narrating the filming process \u2018in the moment\u2019 to relations in an earlier time \u2013 \u2018how long do you think it takes for a child to become separate?\u2019 Throughout the journey film spaces continuously dissolve and collapse only to separate again. Sometimes the artist is behind the camera, sometimes the mother, sometimes both simultaneously behind and in front, or neither. Both perform, film, and alternately instruct, position and direct the other. Formally and thematically, the film is an exploration of closeness, of synching, and the threat this poses to the self.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fW52JKJBHu25gnokvdcnTt9yAwW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
