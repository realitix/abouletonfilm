Perhaps it's Purgatory and they're dead. In the room, two young women, one an actress and the other a psychologist, watch the last few days of their lives on a TV screen. Both are having affairs with married men, each has a long encounter with her lover's wife, and both these scenes take place in a ladies' room, one backstage at a play that's about to preview, the other at an opera house during the first act. The relationships between each pair of younger and older women take surprising turns, and in the room with the TV, a sylph asks probing and challenging questions of the two young women as they watch.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b8NoQiGhipanWHnk6EoNwhBaoTU.jpg", "actors": ["John Malkovich (Roberto)", "Molly Parker (Julia)", "Veronica Ferres (Lauren)", "Lorraine Bracco (Gemma)", "Greta Scacchi (Lucia)", "Anne Bedian (Intella)", "Nanette Workman (Ricki)", "Alan Fawcett (Bill)", "Doroth\u00e9e Berryman (Bag Lady)", "Yahsmin Daviault (Bree)", "Anne Dryburgh (Wig)", "Julien Irwin Dupuy (Young Boy)", "Gillian Ferrabee (Luella)", "Erin Simms (Hair Spray Girl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
