Indeed the place is almost deserted except by four faithful patrons, Francis, a garage owner, Pivois, a man with a modest private income, Loulou, a radio technician and Boudoux, an undertaker. Now, the Robustals employ a fanciful but gifted waiter, Hippolyte. This one happens to be infatuated with Liliane, so much so that one day he takes out a life insurance in her favor. The four regulars' reaction is instant: they offer Robustal to execute Hippolyte, in exchange for a commission. But the trouble (at least for them!) is that Hippolyte is indestructible.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j0sODlMUuJq7cRvxx4gDkdK0cCw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
