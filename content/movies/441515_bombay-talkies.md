It tries to capture the essence of people living in the city through seven characters who have been strung together in a series of monologues. Stories about the ambitions of a child artist, the escape of a ridiculed wife into art, a single mother\u2019s sacrifice of her life for the sake of her children, child abuse, a TV reporter\u2019s regret of the media\u2019s inability to celebrate positivism rather than sensationalism and negative news, a hilarious take on corruption by a broker and the west beckoning today\u2019s youth are all interwoven. Each character, marked by failure and doubt are clearly self \u2013censored. While they may communicate through candid expression, they subtly allude to greater truths.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3TYlytotSyr7W8H8AKktb1hkDxm.jpg", "actors": ["Ratnabali Bhattacharjee (Rohini Bannerjee)", "Neil Bhoopalam (Patrick Menezes)", "Namit Das (Shobit Patel)", "Rasika Dugal (Amrita Mathur)", "Darshan Jariwala (Raj Gidwani)", "Mansi Multani (Baby Dimple)", "Anahita Uberoi (Kavita Dubey)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "UpOEtBaWO0k"}
