When he reaches the center of the continent, finds apparently nothing but wilderness and \u2018uncivilized\u2019 natives with strange ways of living. But Captain Pedro, the rude scout who guides him through the jungle, involves Diogo in an involuntary act of violence which will tie him in an unusual way to that far away country. At the same time, the Portuguese colonists are trying to make peace with Guaicuru Indians (one of the few natives with horse-riding abilities). But peace doesn\u2019t ever have a low price.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bRz4d8BwTwLhpnLvMJ1JvmlbjPc.jpg", "actors": ["Diogo Infante (Diogo de Castro e Albuquerque)", "Floriano Peixoto (Capit\u00e3o Pedro)", "Luciana Rigueira (\u00c1note)", "Leonardo Villar (Comandante)", "Buza Ferraz (Ant\u00f4nio)", "Murilo Grossi (Alfonso)", "Murilo Grossi (Padre)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
