Musashi survives the battle and goes back home, where he wins duel after duel.  He leaves his hometown and concentrates on his swordsmanship, and becomes stronger in mind and body. The drama portrays life-size Musashi while closing in on his inner mind. The action scenes are truly awesome with use of wire actions and CG, and the last duel against Kojiro is definitely a must see climax scene, the ultimate highlight of the drama.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fp92FlwJvnd0tmkIb7JmSAwsERd.jpg", "actors": ["Takuya Kimura (Miyamoto Musashi)", "Shota Matsuda (Seijuro)", "Y\u016bsuke Santamaria (Honiden Matahachi)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
