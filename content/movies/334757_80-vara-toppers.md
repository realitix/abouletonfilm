We celebrate this with the DVD you have in your hands. About 5 hours top entertainment from VARA's entertainment cabinet. Fragments that will take you from 1958 to now. You still remember Dorus with his mouse trap? Or the \"Kopspijkers\" cabaret with the song \"One Day Fly\", Theo Maassen with his farewell speech of Henk van den Tillaart or Harry Vermegen and Henk Spaan with Popie Jopie? That's all on this DVD, and more!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2sYKlFRJqJwJnO75dxJU2bd0WBu.jpg", "actors": ["Donald Jones (Himself)", "The Ramblers (Themselves)", "Peter Lohr (Himself)", "Eric Herfst (Himself)", "Jasperina de Jong (Herself)", "Hetty Blok (Herself)", "Leen Jongewaard (Himself)", "Wim Sonneveld (Himself)", "Rudi Carrell (Himself)", "Wim de Bie (Himself)", "Kees van Kooten (Himself)", "Tom Manders (Himself)", "Fons Jansen (Himself)", "Willy Alberti (Himself)", "Jenny Arean (Herself)", "Tom Manders (Dorus)", "Frans Halsema (Himself)", "Wim Kan (Himself)", "Robert Long (Himself)", "Gerard Cox (Himself)", "Danny Willis and The Fox (Themselves)", "Sonja Barend (Herself)", "Dolf Brouwers (Himself)", "Ivo de Wijs (Himself)", "Youp van 't Hek (Himself)", "Martine Bijl (Herself)", "Henk Spaan (Himself)", "Harry Vermeegen (Himself)", "Harry Vermeegen (Hans Lansberg)", "Sjoukje Hooymaayer (Dokter Lydie van der Ploeg)", "John Leddy (Koos Dobbelsteen)", "Carry Tefsen (Mien Dobbelsteen)", "Jaap Mulder (Himself)", "Brigitte Kaandorp (Herself)", "Joost Prinsen (Himself)", "Karin Bloemen (Herself)", "Willeke Alberti (Herself)", "Jeroen van Merwijk (Himself)", "Paul de Leeuw (Himself)", "Rene Klijn (Himself)", "Erik van Muiswinkel (Himself)", "Ajuinen en Look (Themselves)", "Coen Flink (Opa)", "Wilfried de Jong (Himself)", "Martin van Waardenberg (Himself)", "Herman Finkers (Himself)", "Harrie Jekkers (Himself)", "Schudden Voor Gebruik (Themselves)", "Marcel Verreck (Himself)", "Rik Lorenzo Dros (Himself)", "Bert Visscher (Himself)", "Theo Maassen (Himself)", "Theo Maassen (Herself)", "Jack Spijkerman (Himself)", "De Vliegende Panters (Themselves)", "Robert ten Brink (Himself)", "Sanne Wallis de Vries (Herself)", "Klaas van der Eerden (Himself)", "Guido Weijers (Himself)", "Guido Weijers (Themselves)", "Hans Teeuwen (Himself)", "Najib Amhali (Himself)", "Lenette van Dongen (Herself)", "Paul Groot (Jan Wolkers)", "Jochem Myjer (Himself)", "Dolf Jansen (Himself)", "Javier Guzman (Himself)", "Eric van Sauers (Himself)", "Sara Kroos (Herself)", "Thomas van Luyn (Himself)", "Mike Bodd\u00e9 (Himself)", "Ashton Brothers (Themselves)", "Plien en Bianca (Themselves)", "Andre Manuel (Himself)", "Owen Schumacher (Himself)", "Cor Bakker (Himself)", "Claudia de Breij (Herself)", "Viggo Waas (Himself)", "Peter Heerschop (Himself)", "Willem Ruis (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
