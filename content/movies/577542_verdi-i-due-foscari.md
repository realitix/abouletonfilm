The production is simple and straightforward, the conducting of the modest orchestra shows a sure touch of the Verdi style. Picture and sound are fine. Above all, the singing delivers full value of the score.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v6KIC5q9ZaHWncpq0YFV82nnHly.jpg", "actors": ["Leo Nucci ()", "Vincenzo La Scola ()", "Alexandrina Pendatchanska ()", "Danilo Rigosa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
