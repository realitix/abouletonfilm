Unsurprisingly, crime has grown alongside technology, and thus the GOTT, Galactic Organization of Trade and Tariffs, is formed as a sort of universal police force. Within this organization, there is a special (and secret) branch known as the ES Force (ES standing for \"Encounter of Shadow-work\"), consisting of twelve young people that possess amazing superpowers. Each ES member operates with another as a team, and the series' focus is a team of two low-level members, \u00c9clair and Lumi\u00e8re. As the series progresses, they start to see the darker side of GOTT and its secrets.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iz4yy3ugrfFty426KvvcOnlSRxI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
