These budding comedy stars are as crazy offstage as they are on: Miguel, America s funniest illegal alien ; Miles, who can t decide if he s a black comic or a comic who happens to be black; Bruce, whose manic act borders on insanity; and Peter, the intense political satirist. The Funny Farm is a hilarious and insightful look into those who live the lives of comedians. Starring comedy superstar Howie Mandel (Walk Like a Man, Deal or No Deal, America s Got Talent), game show legend Jack Carter (The Hollywood Squares, Match Game) and the great Eileen Brennan (Private Benjamin).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qCFZL4mVWIBz22GV4TkgR5pZpl2.jpg", "actors": ["Miles Chapin (Mark Champlin)", "Peter Aykroyd (Stephen Croft)", "Howie Mandel (Larry Pound)", "Tracey E.
