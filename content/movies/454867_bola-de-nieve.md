A master pianist, Bola de Nieve was a mainstay through the middle portion of the 20th century, with his music almost omnipresent in South America cinema throughout those formative decades. With Bola de Nieve's famous statement \"I'm a sad person, but my songs sound happy\" in mind, Sanchez-Montes also looks at the influence of the musician's African heritage and homosexuality upon Bola de Nieve's unique musical style.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vd2MoROwTptavkvonkTBEhnDexe.jpg", "actors": ["Bola de Nieve (Himself (archive footage))", "Nisia Aguero ()", "Santiago Auser\u00f3n ()", "Miguel Barnet ()", "Esther Borja ()", "Vicente Garrido ()", "Harold Gramatges ()", "Rogelio Par\u00eds ()", "Antonio Pe\u00f1alver ()", "Luis Pe\u00f1alver ()", "Roberto Zurbano ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
