The film was a community effort which brought together various agencies, residents, brothel owners, sex-workers, film students and production houses in support of the need for community-friendly information. It is an example of Pink Triangle Malaysia's working approach of community development for HIV/AIDS education, support and care. Bukak Api or \"to open fire\" is street lingo among sex-workers to mean \"to have sex with a client\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t9lm3yxvEbJrYeHYoAGJpTAfnma.jpg", "actors": ["Mislina Mustaffa (Murni)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
