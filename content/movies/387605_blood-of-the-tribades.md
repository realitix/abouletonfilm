The only problem with this plan is that the vampires, although immortal, have only a limited capacity for memory. As time passes, they forget their utopian society and led by the totalitarian zealot Grando, become paranoid, superstitious fundamentalists, splitting their society by race and gender lines, seeking to destroy those who are deemed sinful. Long-forgotten lovers \u00c9lisabeth and Fantine find that, with the help of those who were banished in the past, it is their fate to piece together the past and help preserve the little that remains before Bathor\u2019s impending return.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oTnSJIBfDVpvTjlPHhFuB8w8jy4.jpg", "actors": ["Chlo\u00e9 Cunha (\u00c9lisabeth)", "Mary Widow (Fantine)", "Seth Chatfield (Grand)", "Seth Chatfield (Grando)", "Tymisha \"Tush\" Harris (The Great One)", "Kristofer Jenson (Sava)", "Zach Pidgeon (Berwick)", "Sindy Katrotic (Giltine)", "Hugh Guiney (Stoker)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "VomxTmbizQQ"}
