By overlapping Fierro, a wise and sensible man, with Per\u00f3n, the latter is characterized as a natural political leader, and something of a political father figure for the nation, the only one capable of leading Argentina toward national dignity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lL2vLbrZiYDz15qlpoQPdvHTe5j.jpg", "actors": ["Martiniano Mart\u00ednez ()", "Julio Troxler ()", "Jos\u00e9 Almejeiras ()", "Juan Carlos Gen\u00e9 ()", "Arturo Maly ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
