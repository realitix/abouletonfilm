In a remote village in Korea lives a boy with the power to heal. He can resurrect the dead. And that is exactly what he does. Curing people of death, he gives them back life. However, the new life doesn\u2019t cure them, on the contrary. Rejecting the chance proffered by rebirth, the fighting, killing and murder continue. They punish, spit upon and antagonise the boy. Refusing to be deterred, he goes his own way. The boy and the villagers move about in rigorously framed shots, practically devoid of emotion. There is no cry of jubilation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4QSqUVL9fTI8FdizWDfew4FIvUR.jpg", "actors": ["Ji Hye-chan ()", "Park Ji-hwan ()", "Hyeong Yeong-seon ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
