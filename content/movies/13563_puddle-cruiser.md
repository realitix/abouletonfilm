It has less comedic value than any of their films to follow, and it is only in the characters of Matt and Grogan that you can see the trademark stoner humour that Broken Lizard would come to represent. Puddle Cruiser is more of your typical 90's \"teen movie\" a little bit of comedy, a little bit of romance, some coming of age themes and someone gets beaten up. That formula runs through the film and it works, it just doesn't work spectacularly.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"}], "recommandations_id": [22216, 166981, 180323, 24585]}
