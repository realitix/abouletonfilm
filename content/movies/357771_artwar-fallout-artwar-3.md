Drawing upon pivotal moments in Jeff Keen's own life - serving in WW2 - these explosive films are a distillation of the themes and concerns that run throughout his work. These compelling titles stage a frenetic attack on our sense of modern culture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fUOSSc748BbkT2ageWPDNnY9ng8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
