Mabley appeared in the film, along with veteran actors Butterfly McQueen and Stepin Fetchit, only a year before her death at the age of 81. The film does not deal with the popular Christian hymn (with words by John Newton) but is a play on Mabley's character, who happens to be named Grace. It has been released on home video.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zP5rajH6zxxK1u2k6JrP2YoKlBK.jpg", "actors": ["Slappy White (Forthwith Wilson)", "Moms Mabley (Grace)", "Stepin Fetchit (Cousin Lincoln)", "James Karen (Annenberg)", "Gary Bolling (William)", "Moses Gunn (Welton J Waters)", "Rosalind Cash (Creola Waters)", "Butterfly McQueen (Clarine)", "George Miles (Blaney)", "Dolph Sweet (Mayer Scott)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
