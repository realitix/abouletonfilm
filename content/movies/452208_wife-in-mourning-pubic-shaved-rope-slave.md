As she begins a similar relationship with a man whose wife left him because of his kinky urges, their mutual mental deterioration leads them down a spiral toward a double-suicide pact. Since this is a Sato film, things are not entirely as they appear. The torture and bondage scenes are above average for their type. Noriko Akikawa stars with Yutaka Ikejima, Rio Serizawa, and Tori Asano.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9yFgb5v06LobXpXhUKAIZ4bLcB6.jpg", "actors": ["Noriko Akikawa ()", "Rio Serizawa ()", "Momori Asano ()", "Ichir\u00f4 Yoshioka ()", "K\u00f4ichi Imaizumi ()", "Yutaka Ikejima ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
