Benning relates her personal rebellion against school, family, and female stereotypes as a story of personal freedom, telling how she used to model like Matt Dillon and skip school to have adventures alone. Informed by the underground \u201criot grrrl\u201d movement, this tape transforms the image politics of female youth, rejecting traditional passivity and polite compliance in favor of radical independence and a self-determined sexual identity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dP492XckuxXaYYOgdr4R5BX5GBf.jpg", "actors": ["Sadie Benning ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
