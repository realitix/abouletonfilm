Just 39 and at the peak of his powers running the Royal Navy, Churchill in 1914 dreamt of Napoleonic glory, but suffered a catastrophic fall into disgrace and humiliation over the Dardanelles disaster.  The film follows his road to redemption, beginning in the trenches of Flanders in 1916, revealing how he became the 'godfather' of the tank and his forgotten contribution to final victory in 1918 as Minister of Munitions. Dark political intrigue, a passionate love story and remarkable military adventures on land, sea and air combine to show how the Churchill of 1940 was shaped and forged by his experience of the First World War.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/upESFVxQCMcktJnHzAudj8OuLgW.jpg", "actors": ["Adam James (Winston Churchill)", "Verity Marshall (Clementine Churchill)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
