This set him apart from his more public contemporaries, such as Herbert von Karajan. This biographical documentary attempts to resolve the ambiguities surrounding Kleiber. The product of exhaustive research, it features rare performance footage of Kleiber leading orchestras, and draws on interviews with individuals who knew and worked with the maestro, including Otto Schenk, Riccardo Muti, Michael Gielen and Ioan Holdender. Carlos Kleiber also turns up to conduct a series of illustrative musical excerpts.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tJB9GTrkMes5I0S0Fm74v3Gzwo.jpg", "actors": ["Carlos Kleiber (Conductor)", "Ileana Cotrubas ()", "Michael Gielen ()", "Riccardo Muti ()", "Otto Schenk ()", "Ioan Holender ()", "Sir Peter Jonas ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
