This project is a form of 'exercising/re-drawing' memory, which in turn produces new identities. I want to recreate a particular donkey illustration my grandfather drew. During the cultural revolution, my grandfather was punished for such a drawing. After my grandfather drew this illustration, the Chinese government put him in Xi'an for two years and forced my grandmother to divorce him. Memory becomes glue holding three of us together. Could these drawings be the past and future? Is it be-coming or de-coming?\" \u2013 XS", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lQsWQaOrnqr6K5o2FAoOc0WTs1Z.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
