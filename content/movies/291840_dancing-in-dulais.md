{"tmdb_id": 291840, "title": "Dancing in Dulais", "original_title": "Dancing in Dulais", "slug_title": "dancing-in-dulais", "date": "1986-01-01", "genre": ["Documentaire"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "Dancing in Dulias was made by members of Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners (LGSM) and Lesbians Against Pit Closures during and immediate after the 1984/85 minders strike. Like the forthcoming movie, Pride, it documents the interactions between lesbians and gay men and the miners and their families in Dulais in South Wales - only this time it's the real thing. As well as some memorable footage that includes the Blaenant Lodge banner leading the 1985 Lesbian and Gay Pride march and LGSM members struggling with bingo at the local community hall, the film documents the wider political impact of this seemingly unlikely alliance.
