The film follows a young girl (Tilda Swinton of Narnia fame) and her thoughts as she circumnavigates West Berlin alongside the 96 mile long, iconic, symbol of the cold war.  The film blends visual and audio art into a montage of simple scenes depicting the wall, its watch towers and life along the border strip just as it was a year before the wall fell and the cold war ended.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Tilda Swinton (The Cyclist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
