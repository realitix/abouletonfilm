To remind us of our similarities and celebrate our differences. To allow the positive energy of ONEness to emerge in a world that too often seems disconnected and broken. The film's concept is simple: Ask the ultimate questions of the life to the great masters and to everyday people. Then let the dialog flow. The result is a movie that has sparked dialog on six continents and in hundreds of venues - from barns to prisons to universities to theaters. ONE riminds us that we are all on a journey to better understand ourselves, our connections with others, and our utlimate meaning and detiny.
