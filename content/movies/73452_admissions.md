Cynical, world-weary Evie is more interested in taking care of her family than getting into the Ivy League institutions for which she seems destined. Dad Harry spends all his time building model trains in the basement, while workaholic mom Martha depends on Evie to take care of her other daughter, developmentally challenged Emily. When she's not busy reading poetry to her sister Emily, Evie hangs out with James (Fran Kranz), the sensitive boy next door, whose romantic overtures prove too confusing to acknowledge. College also seems too daunting, so Evie deliberately blows one university interview after another in the hopes of staying at home as her sister's keeper. Meanwhile, Evie begins passing off her own poems as Emily's, fuelling the belief that her brain-damaged sister is actually a literary savant.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xTOe8i8jFN7K74mpz5mEgVuOBUS.jpg", "actors": ["Lauren Ambrose (Evie Brighton)", "Amy Madigan (Martha Brighton)", "Christopher Lloyd (Steward Worthy)", "Fran Kranz (James Parks)", "Taylor Roberts (Emily Brighton)", "Taylor Roberts (Emily Brighton)", "Vernee Watson-Johnson (Stanford Interviewer)", "Benjamin Pratt (Dartmouth Interviewer)", "Scott Adsit (Harvard Interviewer)", "John Savage (Harry Brighton)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
