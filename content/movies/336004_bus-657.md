It was from the 'The Tournament' director and has a good cast. De Niro playing a small role is a disappointment, but for his age it was not bad. Jeffrey Dean Morgan was good, but as most of the story takes place on a moving bus, it was not a performance based film, just a crime-thriller with some action sequences.\r\n\r\nThe story of a single father who needs a big sum for his daughter's operation. So he decides to rob a casino where he works which actually goes wrong and end up in a bus with the hostages. The casino men and the cops, both are after him, he's certainly got trapped without any option to get away with it is the film that ends with a decent climax scene.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw Gina Carano in 'Haywire', I thought she might be the next big thing in the female action star world, but disappointed with how her career shaped up. Even for this film the role was not up to her caliber. The story was the film's strength, but if you are focused you could predict some of the scenes. Really well shot film, the production was good and this is where the big stars and the B movie meets. Seen a lot worse than this, so quite enjoyable and instantly forgettable film.\r\n\r\n6/10"}], "recommandations_id": [334527, 359412, 334074, 241554], "youtube_key": "aE_SiB95FAY"}
