Stanley's success as a novelist has been largely due to his style where he writes from the first person perspective of the central characters, who are always the killers in real-life cases. Troubled with writer's block, his agent suggests a tramping trip \"to clear his mind\". However, when he wakes up on the first morning of his tramp, he finds his fellow tramper dead.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b1od9HL3lxgoJInGybimKZvwVgt.jpg", "actors": ["Gareth Reeves (Stanley)", "Jinny Lee Story (Marissa)", "Marshall Napier (Tom)", "Ian Mune (Bill)", "Renato Bartolomei (Colby)", "Cameron Rhodes (Rick)", "Tom Hern (Kevin)", "Rachel Blampied (Anna)", "Michelle Langstone (Natalee)", "Ben Mitchell (Jon)", "Ilona Rodgers (Margaret)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "VtIx0N8L5Tc"}
