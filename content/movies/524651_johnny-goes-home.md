At age 56, Johnny goes back to his hometown of Norfolk Nebraska, where he grew up, and conducts a guided tour down memory lane, pointing out the stores he frequented, the office where his father worked, the high school he attended and the house in which he lived. It's like being invited over to watch home movies with Johnny, and indeed home movies from Johnny's own childhood, courtesy of his father, are featured throughout this heartwarming special.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Johnny Carson (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
