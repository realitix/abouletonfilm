They ask him where his creator is and ask about what kind of person he is, and Wilt runs away as they pester him with more questions. Soon, Wilt decides to run away from the Foster's home and set things right with a mysterious enemy. The result is a chase in which Bloo, Mac, Eduardo, Coco, Frankie, Police officer Nina Valerosa (who created Eduardo), Douglas, and Adam (Coco's nerdy caretakers who are madly in love with Frankie) try to bring Wilt home. At every stop, they miss him and he does some good deed and misses whatever transportation he was going to take cross-country to his creator.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5a572VmUEscbCJZq0xGNEtJsk4y.jpg", "actors": ["Sean Marquette (Mac)", "Keith Ferguson (Blooregard)", "Phil LaMarr (Wilt)", "Tom Kenny (Eduardo)", "Candi Milo (Coco)", "Candi Milo (Coco 1)", "Candi Milo (Madame Foster 2)", "Grey DeLisle (Frances 'Frankie' Foster)", "Tom Kane (Mr. Herriman)", "Jeff Bennett (Douglas)", "Kevin Michael Richardson (Joe)", "Tara Strong (Woman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
