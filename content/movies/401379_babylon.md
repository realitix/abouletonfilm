When a massive refugee camp was hastily constructed near the Ras Jdir border checkpoint in Tunisia, a trio of filmmakers carried their cameras in and began filming with no agenda. This on-the-fly chronicle of the camp's installation, operation, and dismantling captures a postmodern Babel complete with a multinational population of displaced folk, a regime of humanitarian aid workers, and international media that broadcasts its \u201cimage\u201d to the world. Visually stunning and refreshingly undogmatic, Babylon reveals a rarely seen aspect of the Arab Spring.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iPywDG2aWSuarCMytuo9lfZCvJj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
