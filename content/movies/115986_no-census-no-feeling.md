Moe and Larry are recruited to join a bridge game, while Curly adds Alum to the lemonade. The resulting concoction is consumed by everyone, resulting in puckered lips and shrunken clothes. The boys next try to take the census at a football stadium. They disguise themselves as players and wind up in the middle of the game. Curly runs off with the ball and all the other players in pursuit.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7wcVbaAudzztyIqMG5fD7RAgCYX.jpg", "actors": ["Curly Howard (Curly)", "Moe Howard ()", "Larry Fine ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [115934, 116057, 115993, 115920], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
