This movie is based on a very long and popular novel by George Calmescu, and is similar in some ways to England's BBC television series, The Forsythe Saga, based on Galsworthy's books. Along the way, stories of friendship, love and rivalry emerge. In one story, a poor young man is disappointed in love as his girl chooses lucre over love in selecting a mate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bWejEEiKzZfeOuw8ziESEW6W5nZ.jpg", "actors": ["Radu Boruzescu (Felix Sima)", "Sergiu Nicolaescu (Leonida Pascalopol)", "Julieta Sz\u00f6nyi (Otilia)", "Gheorghe Dinic\u0103 (Stanica Ratiu)", "Clody Bertola (Aglae Tulea)", "Ovidiu Schumacher (Titi)", "Gina Patrichi (Olimpia Ratiu)", "Elena Dacian (Aurica Tulea)", "\u00c1rp\u00e1d Kem\u00e9ny (Simion Tulea)", "Herman Chrodower (Costache Giurgiuveanu)", "Eliza Petrachescu (Marina)", "Violeta Andrei (Georgeta)", "Jean Lorin Florescu (Toader Ratiu)", "Jean Constantin ()", "Leni Dacian ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
