He tries hitchhiking, but since nobody picks him up (though one car stops and gives him a double-talk explanation), he walks. This gives us the chance to see a number of regional gags: a hillbilly father tells his son to work, and the son asks why?; the long arm of the law (literally) goes after a moonshiner; the goose eats a watermelon, and is chased off by the farmer; two Southern gentlemen cordially tilt the pinball table. Meanwhile, the doubletalking car stops a few more times, the last of them on a dock; it drives off the dock, and the goose says he can't rescue the driver, complete with the same kind of double-talk explanation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4ICag2fNCQevI1HxEthsEzXp3n2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
