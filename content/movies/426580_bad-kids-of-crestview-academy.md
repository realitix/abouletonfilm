When Siouxsie, sophomore 'undercrust,' crashes the party to avenge her sister's death, a Saturday detention reserved for the privileged seniors of Crestview Academy turns into a date in hell. It's not long before a na\u00efve pussycat lover, gay drug dealer, smokin' hot preacher's daughter, squeaky-clean senator's son, and the uninvited younger outsider find themselves locked-up in school with no way out, wondering who (or what) has set them up. Hilarity and suspense ensue while each 'bad kid' pits one against the other, and one by one each falls victim to absurdly gruesome 'accidents' while trying to escape.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/frVFhblTEDnGSaBp8vg1YurOPmV.jpg", "actors": ["Gina Gershon (Senator Wilkes)", "Sean Astin (Headmaster Nash)", "Sammi Hanratty (Siouxsie)", "Drake Bell (Ben)", "Ben Browder (Max)", "Sophia Taylor Ali (Faith Jackson)", "Ali Astin (Ethel (as Alexandra Astin))", "Cameron Deane Stewart (Matt Clark)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "Gimly", "content": "However minor the charms of the first _Bad Kids_ movie might have been, its sequel lacks them entirely.
