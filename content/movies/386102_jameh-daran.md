Unexpectedly, she sees a man very much like her father. Regardless of her uncle's objection, Shirin is enchanted by the idea of finding out that man. Reluctantly, her uncle acknowledges that the man is her father's illegitimate child. Looking at gloomy daughter, Shirin's mother tells her about some past events, especially about an unexpected truth that Shirin is her father's adopted daughter. It seems to be clear that Shirin and that man have no blood bond. But her father's mistress tells a different story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kvN1UD3yORTnirKGFV3y6JHKgcw.jpg", "actors": ["Mahtab Keramati ()", "Baran Kosari ()", "Pegah Ahangarani ()", "Mostafa Zamani ()", "Afsar Asadi ()", "Mahmoud Behrouzian ()", "Farzaneh Neshat-Khah ()", "Elham Nami ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
