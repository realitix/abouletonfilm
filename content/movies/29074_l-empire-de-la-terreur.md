Enter his daughter, who at birth was the reason for Morella\u2019s death and thus Price originally holds a grudge, but of course there is a twist in the tale.\r\n\r\nSecondly is The Black Cat, with Peter Lorre joining Price in the best of the three tales. Price is a wine tasting dandy, Lorre a complete drunk and once Price meets Lorre\u2019s beautiful put upon wife, things are going to end badly.\r\n\r\nFinally is The Case of M Valdemar which pits Basil Rathbone into the mix as a devious hypnotist who uses his powers for what he thinks will be sexually tinged deeds. Price is in this as well, but spends most of the story as a corpse.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a short sharp shock piece of film making, fun and sometimes stylish, it doesn\u2019t however have the requisite scares to marry up with the welcome black humour that makes the second instalment the standout. \r\n\r\nStill, having three legends of cinema in one picture has to be a bonus, and The Black Cat alone is worth investing time with this one. 7/10"}], "recommandations_id": [30137, 29030, 29235, 23439], "youtube_key": "Y58nHVXTO1c"}
