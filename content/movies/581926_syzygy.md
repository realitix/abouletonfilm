It is an abstract work, inspired by Paul Klee\u2019s pedagogical diagrams, for which Padamsee developed his own mathematical pattern, and produced 1000 drawings on transparent cell animation sheets. Each drawing composed of numbers, alphabets, abstract geometric shapes, dots, dashes, was based on a differing configuration generated by his own devised code. Syzygy is a remarkably complex work that Adajania associates with the 1960\u2019s experiments of John Cage. When she queried Padamsee about this connection, he acknowledged that he was reading Cage\u2019s writings at the time, and was acquainted with the work of Iannis Xenakis.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zqq5kIqsThKxQaW1pXn1ipTAtgO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
