I rehearsed a certain amount of continuous time each day, logging almost 70 hours of uninterrupted improvisation. I recorded a number of these sessions, and layered them into two tracks.\r In addition to playing guitar, I also hiked into waterfalls, went swimming all the time, watched sunsets from the tops of mountains, helped process thousands of spawning salmon, etc. I took my camcorder with me most of those places. I've compiled some of the things my camcorder saw into this video, a format I'm tentatively calling a collaged home movie. It's in two parts - Side A, and Side B. Each is about a half an hour long.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h1ZLjqTxeTelVZ2uUdl0i7L0YCK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
