Six days later the police used live ammunition to brutally suppress the strike, killing 34 and injuring many more. Using the point of view of the Marikana miners, Miners Shot Down follows the strike from day one, showing the courageous but isolated fight waged by a group of low-paid workers against the combined forces of the mining company Lonmin, the ANC government and their allies in the National Union of Mineworkers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dIhK8Xc4CekQOge3zrbYvqdTHeS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "pkK_T_vz7cY"}
