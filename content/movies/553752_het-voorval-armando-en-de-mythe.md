His childhood was defined by one crucial incident; a boy kills a German soldier in the woods during the Second World War. The story recurs in Armando\u2019s work in many forms.: an ill-fated event, a victim that becomes a perpetrator, a guilty forest that witnessed everything but remains silent. Was Armando involved in the fateful event or did he invent a tragedy of mythological proportions? Filmmakers Sjors Swierstra and Roelof Jan Minneboo go in search of answers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h9lQrOylpLPiBdXciYjAm22DUgh.jpg", "actors": ["Rover Wouters ()", "Pascal Kijzer ()", "Thomas Bos ()", "Armando ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "hjs0gDo8auM"}
