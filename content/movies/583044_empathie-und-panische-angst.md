All this takes place in a narrowly defined pictorial space, in a face, in a few square centimeters of a room wall, in the leaves of a plant, in holding the teacup. What miraculously blends together in this film: an empathic woman (the therapist), directed by an empathic woman (the director), tells an empathic cameraman about experiences with people in panic. The film is empathic and speaks at the same time of the disturbed relationship of the people to each other, to themselves and to the objects that surround them. What makes him even more exciting is the not clearly decipherable network of relationships between the three people involved in the film and the space that encloses them \"(Dagmar Boarding)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fKLNOwZ7SmNgw9h9KXs9mfHIx87.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
