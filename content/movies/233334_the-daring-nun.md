Unlike the usual nun, however, she often goes out to see the world, being of the opinion that nuns should not lead cloistered lives but should see something of modern life. She makes the acquaintance of a young girl named lkuko (Kayo Mikimoto) and saves her from the advances of a gangster named Goro (lchiro Nakatani). In the meantime she turns down several propositions and, in revenge, one of her admirers denounces her to the Mother Superior (Kuniko Miyake). This lady is of liberal views, however, and refuses to do anything about it. Then Shunko is visited by Goro's gang boss who wants lkuko back and says he will blackmail Shunko unless she agrees.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qcPEHtxI18ncgOf7jWBK9x3qrj4.jpg", "actors": ["Michiyo Ookusu (Sister Shunko)", "Kayo Mikimoto (Ikuko)", "Naomi Kobayashi ()", "Shigako Shimegi (Sister Chiei)", "Ichir\u00f4 Nakatani (Goro Isaoka)", "Toshio Takahara (Miura)", "H\u00f4sei Komatsu (Ichizo Soga)", "Fukuro Morino (Machida)", "Yukari Mizumachi (Nobuyo)", "Kuniko Miyake (Mother Superior)", "Akira Moroguchi ()", "Yukio Horikita (Seiji)", "Jun Fujikawa (Detective)", "Tokio Oki (Passenger A)", "Sumao Ishihara (Passenger B)", "Hiromi Inoue (Sanae)", "Ranko Hikari (Fusako)", "Natsuko Oka (Girl)", "Masaya Wada (Student)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
