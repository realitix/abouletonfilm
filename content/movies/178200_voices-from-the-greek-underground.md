It is a film about a group of Greek artists and publishers that remained sometimes unseen and sometimes underground, and their personal statement in their effort to change the world with the power of art.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
