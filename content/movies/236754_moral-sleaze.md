With a pit bull\u2019s passive aggressiveness, Lee pokes fun at pretentious DIY video-making culture by creating a character who is both an unwilling participant and an annoyed observer of a ridiculous project that will surely bring her very little in return, let alone love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Av38ITn5hJdrjWDE34qB14ij1Uo.jpg", "actors": ["Jiyoung Lee (Jiyoung)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
