MY DAILY ROUTINE is a playful visual diary of filmmaker David Lowery's days, from waking in the morning to turning in at night, when his racing mind refuses to let him sleep without working over a new creative project or reading until the wee hours. It is also about the frustrations of creative work and the lure of distraction as a self-employed filmmaker and editor-for-hire in a plugged-in world. Narrated by the filmmaker and illustrated in hand-drawn sketches, it plays out like a mock slide-show (complete with the projector hum and click of changing images) by way of a tutorial. \"I made MY DAILY ROUTINE at a point where I was just really frustrated with where I was and I wasn't even making things,\" explains Lowery. \"There was a lot of red tape I was trying to cut through with other projects, but I really wanted to make something. This film is what I wound up making.\" - Sean Axmaker", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9w8phCHmNU3EXp4KxVaEcSyzYWH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
