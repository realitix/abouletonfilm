Though each served a number of years in the ministry, each is now an avowed atheist. Calvin King grew up in a Midwestern Mennonite home and spent thirty years as a Mennonite pastor. Annalise Fonza was raised Roman Catholic, attended the Baptist Church, studied to be an attorney, but was eventually ordained a United Methodist minister. Teresa MacBain is the daughter of a conservative Baptist pastor who worked in prison ministry, elder ministry and in a drug rehab program before serving United Methodist pastorates in North Florida. Rich Lyons comes from an Episcopalian background but spent twenty years as the pastor of a United Pentecostal Church in East Texas.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
