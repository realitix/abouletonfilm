Therefore, Peterson forces us to take both space and time as relative experiences. The consistent disorientation in the film and our consistent inability to perceive them in absolute terms become the main subject of the film. Peterson makes us aware that space and time are more complicated than we think they are and they should be experienced in a more open-minded way. \u2014Yoel Meranda", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ztyxHOz8YRJpHlp7TeWjpQnivmg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [102389, 164585, 111161, 350062], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
