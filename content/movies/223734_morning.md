Morning light streams through a window in Gehr's apartment. As Gehr changes the aperture from open to closed and back again, the light pulsates, in turns overwhelmingly bright and almost vanishing in darkness. A beautiful mediation on the essence of cinema and perception.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oVMORsfrGpnGwGzU1WxQ3pAYh2f.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
