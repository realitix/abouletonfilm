From the Potsdamer Platz to the Brandenburg Gate, the camera captures the historic events from all sides and different angles: on the one hand there are news reporters and tourists from all over the world taking pictures, children selling pieces of the wall to passers-by, and people celebrating New Year's Eve, on the other we see abandoned subway stations and officials with blank looks on their faces.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eKWH2OAJJTaTxXg6L3R3BQESKpo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
