It's fortified and hard to attack, so a creative, cynical major gets the assignment to figure something else. With the help of Paco, a Filipino guerrilla leader, the major devises a plan to put four women assassins among the prostitutes. He must recruit and train them, convince his general that an unarmed woman can best a man, and get them on the island. The rest is up to them. An imprisoned killer, a nurse with a fatal disease, a chippie on the lamb from the mob, and a Filipina whom the Japanese assaulted are his team. Can they do it?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9rxQNWFmyHyrwsufkkv2VOBsOJi.jpg", "actors": ["John Ericson ()", "Karen Ericson ()", "Crystin Sinclaire ()", "Nory Wright ()", "Liza Lorena ()", "Johanna Raunio ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
