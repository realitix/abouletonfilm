But peace doesn\u2019t last long: he tries to seduce a country-woman and she invites a mongrel over to her bedroom. The film is, in essence, a melodrama filled with jealousy and betrayal, but it also showcases some original elements that no other cinematography would have dared to suggest in 1929, like the possibility of a romance between an Indian and a white woman (with her taking the first step).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eepRuT88MzKXQbboYxJDMeLsyGM.jpg", "actors": ["Nelo Cosimi ()", "Floren Delbene ()", "Chita Foras ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
