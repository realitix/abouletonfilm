But on his young daughter's birthday, like any day, Abu faces a nerve-wracking shift in a Ramallah yellow cab armed only with an ex-jurist's misplaced pride, a father's loyalty, and a sticker reminding passengers that smoking and carrying AK-47s are prohibited. Rather than address politics or document holy war heroics and villainy, Laila's Birthday focuses on the toll that the unending Palestinian-Israeli conflict extracts from civilians clinging to both employment and a semblance of normal life amidst chaos and corruption, missile attacks and bursts of gunfire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2oRS18orpWS3F7bz7kGiEcyEyZU.jpg", "actors": ["Mohammad Bakri ()", "Areen Omari ()", "Nour Zoubi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "4ttmzPtotFc"}
