This is a refuge for men with diversity of age, physical attributes, marital and social status. These men take a break from their daily lives and put into practice some of their innermost desires and fantasies. This place is no longer available for cruising but during its glory days it used to be one of the busiest cruising areas located at the Jamor National Stadium near Lisbon, Portugal. The park was never empty and activities continued from morning to evening hours. This documentary short film was made in collaboration with Miguel de Arroja who had been capturing action on camera since 2001.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p9qght2VWhrxUqaPEFzjSSYpB6k.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
