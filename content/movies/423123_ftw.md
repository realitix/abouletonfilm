Following the sudden death of their friend Shep, Kristopher and Ryan quickly grow less attached to reality. As they wander the southern landscape of Louisiana, they descend into a state devoid of hope and order; a place where life and death are one and the same; a land where we are all doomed. The aesthetic artifacts of the video tapes and the vernacular wanderings caught on them present a rip-it-up-and-start-again style montage of life caught in the vise of western culture at the dead end of of the first world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7z6RPd2y34CoZwRyirdDaTr8LxJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
