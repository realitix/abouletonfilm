Wow.\r\n\r\nWhy We\u2019re Here: 15 Years of Rooster Teeth is easily the best of the RT Docs series on so many levels. As someone who's been heavily inspired by Rooster Teeth after being introduced to them in 2015, it was immensely inspiring to actually put a image to what they've talked about on podcasts. From hearing the stories of the early days to opening up about Monty and discussing the future, this is easily the documentary I will show someone when they ask \"What's Rooster Teeth?\""}], "recommandations_id": []}
