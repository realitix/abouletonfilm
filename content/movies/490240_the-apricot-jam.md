K\u00e1rinthyho's story about how important it is to have a sense of home. The apricot jam symbolizes the home, family well-being, which the little boy Ferko, living with his parents in a Hungarian town of the 30's of the 20th century, desperately hopes for. A mother with an unfulfilled desire to become a famous pianist and a father with an even more distant dream to be a world-famous and wealthy writer to a son have no time or even a loving word. His loving companion is only Manci, who, however, leaves for misunderstanding with his lords. Ferko remains alone, disappointed and reluctant to accept the friendship of a new maid of R\u00f3zy. But he also has his great dream, and R\u00f3za will help him meet him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zFQj4IwCU0C37uLJRrSsgHabtoT.jpg", "actors": ["Zdena Studenkov\u00e1 (Matka)", "Franti\u0161ek Kov\u00e1r (Otec)", "Alexander Madar (Ferko)", "Adela G\u00e1borov\u00e1 (Roza)", "Alena Michalidesov\u00e1 (Manci)", "Milan Ki\u0161 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
