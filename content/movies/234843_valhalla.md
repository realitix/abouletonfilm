When you've seen the season\u2019s first great snow through the eyes of a child\u2014you've known true happiness. But what happened to that simple joy? Where do we find the freedom that time and wisdom stole away?  Valhalla, Sweetgrass Productions\u2019 fourth feature film, is the tale of one man\u2019s search to rediscover the freedom of his youth. Feeling the distant heat of it\u2019s fire still burning in the mountains of the frozen north, he goes in search of those tending the flame\u2014the untamed, the wild, and the outcast dwelling on the fringe.
