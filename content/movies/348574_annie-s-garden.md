Jump ahead ten years: the dad is dead, the mom is gone, and the son, Luke, is raising his now grown sister, Annie. He's overprotective, and she seems blood simple, a coquette and an innocent. He runs the diner in town, and one day, Lisa, a callow writer-to-be, comes through from Manhattan, keeping a journal, looking for interesting people. She takes a shine to Annie and then to the muscular and well-read Luke. But what is their secret, how many of the townsfolk are in on it, and what will Lisa do when it all becomes clear?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7RxFvdeTEIYW1cvVaIzJp1KnjW5.jpg", "actors": ["Keith Coulouris (Luke Thomas)", "Yancy Butler (Lisa Miller)", "Charlotte Chatton (Annie Thomas)", "Grace Zabriskie (Mrs. Barnes)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
