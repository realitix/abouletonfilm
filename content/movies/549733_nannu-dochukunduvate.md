His entrance to the office encounters fear when the employees start running helter-skelter by rearranging the chairs and pretend to work, kind of how it was shown frame-to-frame in Meryl Streep's The Devil Wears Prada in the scene when she enters the office and the whole workplace goes into chaos. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Megha (Nabha Natesh) is the typical girl-next-door who is totally opposite, lives life on her own terms and finds happiness on small things. Viva Harsha is also part of this film and the best part in this film is the meeting of the opposites which is quite iconic and hilarious which most of us have been watching in every film of the same genre in the past."}], "recommandations_id": []}
