Thus it is that Emma welcomes the opportunity to briefly take leave of her Boston home and head for sunny Hawaii. It is not, however, a pleasure trip: Having promised to honor the dying wishes of her Hawaiian-born surrogate mother, Emma had agreed to transport the woman's ashes to the Islands for a traditional burial ceremony. Leaving her husband, Mike (Andrew McFarlane), behind to care for their two children, Emma arrives in Hawaii for the first time since childhood, where she is reunited with her childhood friend Kala (Jason Momoa), the handsome son of her late surrogate parent. Against her better judgment, Emma falls in love with Kala, and he with her. Complications arise when Mike and the kids show up in the Islands, a the obligatory evil land developer rears his ugly head, and Emma learns the shocking truth about her biological mother.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pU2sTbIma92HiiE20WSAucLF4f1.jpg", "actors": ["Virginia Madsen (Emma Burke)", "Lainie Kazan (Julia)", "Jason Momoa (Kala)", "Ki\u1ec1u Chinh (Kehau)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
