For years I am totally in love with Egyptian mythology, came accross this movie and... wow! This is so bad, that I almost have no words to describe it. The acting: terrible! The dialogues: terrible! The plot: Was there even one? The effects: Some were acceptable. The mummy itself: I actually liked the look of it. After all it was still a total waste of time. Stay away from this movie. Save your time and/or money for something better. Gosh, even The Pyramid was way better, even though I can't stand most of this \"Found Footage\" stuff. But now that I have seen this... Maybe I should rewatch The Pyramid soon!"}], "recommandations_id": [116532, 211914, 39914, 90291], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
