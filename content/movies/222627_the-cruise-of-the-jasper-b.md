Cleggert is informed that in order to inherit a large inheritance, he must marry by his twenty-fifth birthday - otherwise he would relinquish all claims to his impending fortune. Jerry soon meets his ideal would-be bride Agatha Fairhaven (Mildred Harris) and the two immediately fall in love. Complications arise when Jerry's cousin, the dastardly lawyer Reginald Maltravers (Snitz Edwards) claims Agatha as his own. The courting couple suffer a series of mishaps on the way to altar; they are waylaid en route by a trio of bandits, escape from a runaway taxi cab, and outrun a mob of unscrupulous state authorities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8osVuBqQEAWrvrstwdQ0dsSwplT.jpg", "actors": ["Rod La Rocque (Jerry Cleggett)", "Mildred Harris (Agatha Fairhaven)", "Snitz Edwards (Reginald Maltravers)", "Jack Ackroyd (Wiggins)", "Otto Lederer (Auctioneer)", "James T.
