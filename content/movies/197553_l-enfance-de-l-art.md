In the outer story, Andre Dussolier stars as a film director working with drama students at the Paris Conservatory, making a film (the inner story) about a woman's obsession with a foreign desert. Wallowing in maudlin sentimentality, this feature fails to live up to the promise of its probable inspiration, Fame (1980), and was not well-received at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival. However, as a medium for instructing director Francis Girod's actual students at the Paris Conservatory about the art and perils of filmmaking, it was undoubtedly a good deal more successful.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bjCH9r0pwoo50urSn46ZpcXmVmr.jpg", "actors": ["Clotilde de Bayser ()", "Michel Bompoil ()", "Anne-Marie Philipe ()", "Yves Lambrecht ()", "Bruno Wolkowitch ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
