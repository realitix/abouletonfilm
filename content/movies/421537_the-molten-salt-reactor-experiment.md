Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Molten Salt Reactor Experiment was designed to assess the viability of liquid fuel reactor technologies for use in commercial power generation. It operated from January 1965 through December 1969, logging more than 13,000 hours at full power during its four-year run. The MSRE was designated a nuclear historic landmark in 1994.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sQkDvmh309QBY5HHWXPd6t7UOAP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "tyDbq5HRs0o"}
