After saving the life of anti-imperial soldier Wu Chung (Felix Wong Yat-wah), Lau (Max Mok Siu-chung) agrees to help him capture the imperial seal, the symbol of political legitimacy in China at that time. Though both manage to cozy up to General Cheung (Kent Cheng Chuk-see), the guardian of the seal, their plan eventually fails. Wu helps Lau flee from Cheung's clutches and, upon learning that he is a eunuch, makes the lad his 13th wife. At the Wu estate, Lau is forced to deal with more than his share of political intrigue, particularly in dealing with Tak Cheung (Norman Law Man), the lead eunuch in the household.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uIZLE3YxFQTG65eB5g8PYSfl874.jpg", "actors": ["Carrie Ng (Chiu Fung)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
