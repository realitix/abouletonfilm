Rosa, a youth with wealthy parents, wants to establish herself as an artist. The clumsy and enthusiastic Viktor, not quite honest, wants work. When he wanders into Kaminsky's meeting with Opel and says something about irony, the Opel director wants him in on the campaign. Then he steals an idea from Rosa that the Opel director loves. Before Rosa discovers he's expropriated her idea, Rosa and Viktor become lovers. Father-son feelings materialize between Kaminsky and Viktor. Can the impulsive Viktor hold it together before Rosa learns the truth and flies away?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r0FIJErLAQ7GrFizmOlC79KrC9j.jpg", "actors": ["Alexander Scheer (Victor Vogel)", "G\u00f6tz George (Edward Kaminsky)", "Chulpan Khamatova (Rosa Braun)", "Maria Schrader (Johanna von Schulenberg)", "Vadim Glowna (Werner Stahl)", "Heinz-Werner Kraehkamp (G\u00fcnter Pfl\u00fcger)", "Nele Mueller-St\u00f6fen (Michelle)", "Guntram Brattia (Benjamin Schwarz)", "Gudrun Landgrebe (Angela Spiekermann)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "g8GOAofQJHQ"}
