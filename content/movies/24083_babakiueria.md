In 1788, the first white settlers arrived in Botany Bay to begin the process of white colonisation of Australia. But in Babakiueria, the roles are reversed in a delightful and light-hearted look at colonisation of a different kind.  This satirical examination of black-white relations in Australia first screened on ABC TV in 1986 to widespread acclaim with both critics and audiences alike. This is the story of the fictitious land of Babakiueria, where white people are the minority and must obey black laws.  Aboriginal actors Michelle Torres and Bob Maza (Heartland) and supported by a number of familiar faces from the time, including Cecily Polson (E-Street) and Tony Barry, who starred in major ABC-TV hits such as I Can Jump Puddles and his Penguin award-winning Scales of Justice. Babakiueria was awarded the United Nations Media Peace Prize in 1987.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n0okdEnmCYg5oFSFvZnEHSMdyq3.jpg", "actors": ["Michelle Torres (Presenter)", "Bob Maza (Government Minister)", "Kevin Smith (Police Superintendent)", "Cecily Polson (Mother)", "Kelan Angel (Son)", "Marg Haynes (Daughter)", "Garry Williams (Explorer)", "Soul Beliear (Police Sergeant #1)", "Terry Reid (Police Sergeant #2)", "Athol Compton (Newsreader)", "Kati Edwards (Grandmother)", "Yvonne Shipley (Wealthy Woman)", "Tony Barry (Father)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "oUMpPgMGCe8"}
