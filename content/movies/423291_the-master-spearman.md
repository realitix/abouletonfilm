The film critiques the inhumanity of feudal obligations, and Uchida\u2019s direction slyly satirizes the contemporary cinematic audience, whose taste for onscreen bloodshed is mirrored in a crowd gathering to watch the protagonist\u2019s planned suicide. The Master Spearman is imbued with Uchida\u2019s characteristic blend of dark humor and stylized action, and Ryutaro Otomo gives an admirable performance in the lead.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aMKmsinmFE0humhJ67Nvvr1G70E.jpg", "actors": ["Ryutaro Otomo (Takasada Tomita)", "Chikage Awashima (Sakon Murayama)", "Hiromi Hanazono (Umeme)", "Isao Yamagata (Mitsunari Ishida)", "Kensaku Hara (Kazunobu Tomita)", "Masao Oda (Kichibei)", "Eitar\u00f4 Ozawa (Ieyasu Tokugawa)", "Yataro Kurokawa ()", "Chiez\u00f4 Kataoka (Toshinaga Maeda)", "Ry\u00f4suke Kagawa ()", "Eijir\u00f4 Kataoka ()", "Kaj\u00f4 Onoe ()", "Fujio Suga ()", "Kinnosuke Takamatsu ()", "Hisao Toake ()", "Shin Tokudaiji ()", "Eijir\u014d T\u014dno ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
