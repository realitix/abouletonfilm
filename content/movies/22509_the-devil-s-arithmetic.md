Even though personally I have as little to do with Jewish customs as lesbian issues, like Deitch's earlier work, I was able to appreciate it, though I still prefer her earlier film, if I was held at gunpoint and had to rank the two.\r\n\r\nIt's a crying shame, looking at Deitch's IMDb page, that this talented San Francisco native, now 71, has been relegated to basically doing TV episodes since this came out."}], "recommandations_id": [65504, 282901, 44289, 16867], "youtube_key": "kl11PqoaRtU"}
