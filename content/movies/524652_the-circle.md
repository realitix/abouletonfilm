The LHC is a gigantic scientific instrument near Geneva, where it spans the border between Switzerland and France about 100m underground. It is a 27km particle accelerator used by physicists to study the origin of everything. Results and interpretation of the collisions of particles will revolutionize our understanding of the Universe and how it began. The Circle leaves the scientific aspect of the experiment and makes a journey above the ground. We follow the 27km circle in an existential search for local people with an opinion about what's happening below.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2gfDpii6TmBN3bcAqFxnt15pvOQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
