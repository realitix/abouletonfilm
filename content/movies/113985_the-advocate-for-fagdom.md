Testimonies are combined with rare archive images. Art galeries present movie extracts that are succeeded by images shot on location. And the other way round. Writers, film makers, art galeries owners, actors and actresses, photographers, producers, friends and loved ones all join in a game of interpretation, analysis or simple anecdotes. John Waters, Bruce Benderson, Harmony Korine, Gus Van Sant, Richard Kern, Rick Castro and others deliver their impressions, theories and confessions. Everything blends into the fascinating portrait of a singular person blessed with singular talents. A complex personality at war not with a system but all systems. The portrait of a man constantly moving between his punk attitude and extreme sensibility.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lyNOLKGgzg4wLtwch7ph71p1vY5.jpg", "actors": ["Bruce LaBruce (Himself)", "Harmony Korine (Himself)", "Richard Kern (Himself)", "John Waters (Himself)", "Gus Van Sant (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "83EOWvCer8c"}
