The United Nations estimates as many as 200 million girls are missing in the world today because of this so-called \u201cgendercide\u201d.  The film tells the stories of abandoned and trafficked girls, of women who suffer extreme dowry-related violence, of brave mothers fighting to save their daughters\u2019 lives, and of other mothers who would kill for a son. Global experts and grassroots activists put the stories in context and advocate different paths towards change, while collectively lamenting the lack of any truly effective action against this injustice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gfWj80fOUExXZ82pQ5f2Ih5ml2I.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [41835], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
