Joep van Lieshout's giant installation 'The Technocrat'; dominates the stage, its industrial interior giving credence to the idea that Tannh\u00e4user is one big experiment and playing host to some magnificent performances, among them Torsten Kerl's robust interpretation of the title role and Camilla Nylund's wonderfully empathetic Elisabeth.  Recorded live at the Bayreuth Festspiele, August 2014.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nnk4at3hVSycJSBmhcGdbYTSooJ.jpg", "actors": ["Torsten Kerl ()", "Camilla Nylund ()", "Michelle Breedt ()", "Markus Eiche ()", "Kwangchul Youn ()", "Axel Kober ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
