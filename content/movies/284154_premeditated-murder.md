Jelena Panic is a young woman in Belgrade in the early 1990s, during Serbia's war with Croatia; she's making a book of her grandmother's diaries from the end of World War II. She takes up with Bogdan, a young soldier recovering from war wounds. He helps her with her grandmother's story, a tragic triangle involving her effete and well-educated husband and an uneducated major, a Chekist who has, perhaps, the power to save a political prisoner who is the grandmother's friend. As Jelena wonders which man was her grandfather (the Chekist or the husband), Bogdan recovers from his wounds and must decide whether to return to the front. Jelena pleads; duty calls.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lYXnTeMCvBdERYRcxDTe0HlZQou.jpg", "actors": ["Branka Kati\u0107 (Jelena Panti\u0107 (Bulika))", "Neboj\u0161a Glogovac (Bogdan Bilogorac)", "Ana Sofrenovi\u0107 (Jelena Ljubisavljevi\u0107)", "Dragan Mi\u0107anovi\u0107 (Jovan)", "Sergej Trifunovi\u0107 (Krsman Jak\u0161i\u0107)", "Nada Blam (Medicinska sestra)", "Svetozar Cvetkovi\u0107 (Debeli)", "Vladan Dujovi\u0107 (Mladi Branko)", "Predrag Ejdus (Doktor Cvetkovi\u0107)", "Rade Markovi\u0107 (Dr. Branko Kojovi\u0107)", "Dejan Mati\u0107 (Vo\u0111a studentskog pokreta)", "Radoslav Milenkovi\u0107 (Mu\u017edeka)", "Gordana Pavlov ()", "\u200bLjubi\u0161a Samard\u017ei\u0107 (Vidosav)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [110366, 196892, 47144, 4352], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
