He has only one goal: to beat the crap out of Sakurai. A dispute that began 4 years ago is about to be settled, but not before the streets of Ikebukuro are covered in blood...", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gsp8SpcUDHu7dOOACLmFTW8qRMk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
