Bassist Gaku-chan keeps a bucket in the wings for whenever his nerves get the better of him, and drummer Momo-chan is doomed to forever carrying the botched childhood attempts at self-tattooing. It's not until this foursome is forced to look for an additional guitar player after Jin's dad burns his Stratocaster, that attitude and musical ability enter into the equation. Leather-clad, shade-wearing Tani (Tamaki), inseparable from his black Les Paul, is introduced as the king of R'n'R cool and Jinnai keeps him firmly seated on his throne throughout the film, retroactively proclaiming the guitarist, rather than himself, as the band's true hero.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tE6hGLQ2w2VO6lWmYGU2c0OcVt.jpg", "actors": ["Shunsuke Nakamura (Jin)", "Takashi Tsukamoto (Ko-chan)", "Ryuta Sato (Gaku-chan)", "Hiroshi Tamaki (Tani)", "Yumi Asou ()", "Tetsuji Tamayama ()", "Hakuryu ()", "Hanawa ()", "Hiroko Isayama ()", "Ryunosuke Kamiki ()", "Toru Kazama ()", "Katsuya Kobayashi ()", "Kyoko Koizumi ()", "Yutaka Matsushige ()", "Kyoka Suzuki ()", "Kiichi Nakai ()", "Yoshinori Okada ()", "Koichi Sato ()", "Misa Uehara ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
