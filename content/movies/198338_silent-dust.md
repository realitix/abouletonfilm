Not long before the dedication ceremony is to be held, the son shows up; it turns out that he wasn't killed in battle but deserted, and has become a blackmailer and a killer. He wants to get some money to \"start a new life\", but his blind father senses that something is wrong and sets out to find out what's going on.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tbcwJeQO13aYbqNa9ZNAKaL8eRI.jpg", "actors": ["Sally Gray (Angela Rawley)", "Derek Farr (Maxwell Oliver)", "Nigel Patrick (Simon Rawley)", "Stephen Murray (Robert Rawley)", "Beatrice Campbell (Joan Rawley)", "George Woodbridge (Foreman)", "Seymour Hicks (Lord Clandon)", "Marie Lohr (Lady Clandon)", "Edgar Norfolk (Simpson)", "James Hayter (Pringle)", "Yvonne Owen (Nellie)", "Irene Handl (Cook)", "Maria Var (Cafe Singer)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "CyrusPK", "content": "Silent Dust was a surprising discovery - an essentially stage-originated piece shot with a careful cinematic eye. \r\nOne extended sequence captures at one point how a blind man might perceive events that have occurred around him, creating a visual impression of things he has heard and conceived of.  A fascinating piece of pure cinema.\r\nAnother sequence involves a flashback where a character recollects in narration heroic acts whilst the actuality of the history is shown visually.  Again a great use of the cinematic art.\r\nThe outcome of the story is reasonably predictable but guided by the sheer confidence of the cast.  Stephen Murray is very precise as the blind father and Seymour Hicks (whose final role this is, filmed mere months before his death) shows genuine wit and intelligence.  \r\nThis appears to be a virtually forgotten classic but there is something special in having a favourite like this that is seemingly only known and remembered by a few."}], "recommandations_id": [86790, 238730, 240603, 222793], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
