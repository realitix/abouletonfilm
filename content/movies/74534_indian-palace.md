Before seeing the movie I saw one review categorizing it as having Benny Hill style comedy. I did _NOT_ see that at all in this movie. In fact, one criticism that I have is that I'd liked to have seen a little more comedy.  One of the characters is truly over the top, but not slapstick.  But regardless this movie flows elegantly start to finish without being overly saccharine or morbid or falling back on what you might expect for comedy involving the elderly.  This film won't move you like Slumdog Millionaire but it is a quality film in its own right."}], "recommandations_id": [268238, 121826, 81025, 9675]}
