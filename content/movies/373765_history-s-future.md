MP finds himself confronted by a world in which there are no longer any certainties; an era of crisis on many levels. On his travels from country to country, portrayed via an associative image montage and through a series of strange, illuminating, sometimes comic encounters, MP attempts to gain insight into the complexity of life in the 21st-century West - into what commentators have called an age of 'rolling catastrophe'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tegIYdCK0NTn0hspfCyIgOIab3c.jpg", "actors": ["Mark O'Halloran (MP)", "Denis Lavant (Lottery Ticket Seller)", "Anne Consigny (Caroline)", "Hristos Passalis (Yorgos)", "Manjinder Virk (Phoebe)", "Rifka Lodeizen (Anna)", "Brian Gleeson (Driver)", "Johanna ter Steege (Therapist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
