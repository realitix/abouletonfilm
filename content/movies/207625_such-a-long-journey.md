We meet the hero, Gustad (Roshan Seth), in the process of defending the old concrete wall that protects his courtyard from the street, and later he strikes a bargain with an itinerant artist (Ranjit Chowdhry), who covers the wall with paintings from every conceivable religious tradition, with the thought that all of the groups represented will join in defending the wall.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u46Y01D43PsJrrAplpQ65P9MMi0.jpg", "actors": ["Roshan Seth (Gustad Noble)", "Soni Razdan (Dilnavaz Noble)", "Om Puri (Ghulam Mohammad)", "Naseeruddin Shah (Major Jimmy Bilimoria)", "Irrfan Khan (Gustad's Father)", "Sam Dastor ()", "Kurush Deboo ()", "Pearl Padamsee ()", "Vrajesh Hirjee ()", "Dinyar Contractor ()", "Souad Faress ()", "Anahita Uberoi ()", "Anupam Shyam ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "te4N3sOlaXs"}
