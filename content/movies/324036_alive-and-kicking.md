The day he 'deals with' another dealer, she gives birth to a baby. The baby appears to be addicted too and Marie decides to give up the habit. Because Stevie doesn't want to give up using and dealing drugs, they take Marie and the baby away from him. The new, tough, social worker Liam Kane tries to get Stevie in his group sessions, by using his violent approach and by telling him it's the only way he'll ever see Marie and the baby back. So there seems to be hope to get Stevie clean, if only he wants to himself. That things aren't that easy is shown by the drugs addicted hooker Gail, who's satisfied with the life she leads.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xxTItAuZPW3opo5kX0KXP2c77uu.jpg", "actors": ["Lenny Henry (Stevie 'Smudger' Smith)", "Robbie Coltrane (Liam Kane)", "Annabelle Apsion (Marie)", "Jane Horrocks (Gail)", "Geff Francis (Barry Serradilla)", "Paul Barber (Earl Preston)", "Imogen Boorman (Hayley Forbes-Clinton)", "Beresford Le Roy (Leroy)", "Hakeem Kae-Kazim (Jerome)", "Cal Macaninch (Axle)", "Nick Dunning (David Freeman)", "Mark Anthony Newman (Dexter)", "Faith Tingle (Shirley)", "Ewen Cummins (Clyde)", "Al Hunter Ashton (Sgt.
