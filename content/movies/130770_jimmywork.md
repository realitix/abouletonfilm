For him it's now or never. The time has come to become rich and maybe even famous. Pretending to be an American Producer, he offers his services to the St-Tite Rodeo to develop an ad campaign to attract American tourists. Charmed as much by his demeanor as well as by his proposition, the Rodeo organizers call him in for a meeting to present his project. The meeting turns out to be a complete fiasco.
