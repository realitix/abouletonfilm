Their goal: to establish a successful mechanic's shop to get away from their boring jobs as security guards, their loving yet eccentric and demanding families, and poor standard of living in their village - Pickletons. Their simple task of making the down-payment to the garage owner at the village lime that night is hilariously complicated by Romie's love-life, and Pack's love for cannabis. The complications and laughs multiply as the best friends go to extremes to avoid violent drug men, a charity collector, crazy ex-girlfriends and other wacky villagers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mhN8LD5lqp0MUJmnAtlCzrdcrR3.jpg", "actors": ["Andrew Franklin (Romie)", "Damien Gibson (Pack)", "Vincia Clarke (Latisha)", "Arlon Griffith (Juice)", "Dario Bellamy-Audain (Pope)", "Keisha Chapman (Cindy)", "Shakira Forde (Marsha)", "Julian Moseley (Flintstone)", "Dyestra Browne (Mr. Taylor)", "Sandra Sealy (Mrs. Taylor)", "Zandr\u00e9 Bowen (Tallmen)", "Cher Corbin (Ms. Wilcox)", "Icil Phillips (Gran)", "Matthew Murrell (Charity Man)", "Kirk Brown (Nam)", "Kirk Brown (Nam)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
