Worry not, though, Ralph fans: instead of steering the world-class story spinner behind such all-ages gems as \"Kid Astro\" and \"Old Red No. 7\" in a clumsy corporate direction, the label elected to distill 16 of his best and brightest tracks from the six previous Ralph's World discs. Thus we're essentially treated to a greatest-hits package: \"Surfin' in My Imagination,\" \"At the Bottom of the Sea,\" \"Sunny Day Rainy Day Anytime Band,\" and \"The Coffee Song\" all make the cut, and they're as zippy-joyful-plucky as ever.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ipzxDKhqgAfTuH2PmYBWCq19w7z.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
