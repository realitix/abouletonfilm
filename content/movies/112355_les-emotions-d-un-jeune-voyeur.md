He plays Marcus, the preteen son of a recently-remarried, well-to-do writer, whose first wife (Marcus's mother) died a mysterious death. Marcus simultaneously resents his stepmother and feels erotically drawn to her; in desperation, he quickly and aggressively drives her to the point of a psychotic breakdown. He then quietly confesses his act of matricide to the stepmom and implores her to off her husband and abscond with the insurance monies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4dT4k4wLzlrSGcXsafQv4V7xAwk.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Lester (Marcus)", "Britt Ekland (Elise)", "Hardy Kr\u00fcger (Paul)", "Harry Andrews (Headmaster)", "Lilli Palmer (Dr. Viorne)", "Conchita Montes (Sophie)", "Colette Giacobine (Sarah (as Collette Jack))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [39861], "youtube_key": "ipj13cnb0xE"}
