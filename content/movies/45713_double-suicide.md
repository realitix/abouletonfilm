But when he meets the lovely courtesan Koharu, he becomes a man obsessed. Koharu returns his love, even foregoing other customers while Jihei schemes to somehow buy her freedom. His efforts yield ruinous consequences for his business and his family life, and Koharu is meanwhile purchased by another client.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xACR5JGGZsWCnP3j3CUOFhFpUoU.jpg", "actors": ["Kichiemon Nakamura (Jihei)", "Shima Iwashita (Koharu and Osan)", "H\u00f4sei Komatsu (Tahei)", "Y\u00fbsuke Takita (Mogoemon)", "Kamatari Fujiwara (Owner of the Yamatoya)", "Yoshi Kat\u00f4 (Gosaemon)", "Shizue Kawarazaki (Osan's mother)", "Tokie Hidari (Osugi)", "Sumiko Hidaka (Proprietress)", "Takashi Sue (Store Owner)", "Masashi Makita (Guest)", "Makoto Akatsuka (Sangoro)", "Unko Uehara (Otama)", "Shinji Tsuchiya (Kantaro)", "Kaori Tozawa (Osue)", "Jun Hamamura ()"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "talisencrw", "content": "Even though I'm Christian and have always been brought up considering the act of suicide a 'taboo' subject, I have always held great respect for both the Japanese way of doing so to save face, and the thoroughly romantic notion, say, from the likes of 'Romeo and Juliet' (with Shakespeare's writings being probably the cornerstone of Western thought)--so from two completely different cultural perspectives--that a life without the one you love is not worth living.\r\n\r\nI had previously only seen two of Masahiro Shinoda's other works for The Criterion Collection--the earlier works 'Pale Flower' and 'Samurai Spy', and I don't know if it was on purpose by the company in selecting the titles, but I marveled at the breathtaking variety of his scripts, all from such a short timespan (1964-69). Being a patron of the theatre (in many different modes) and as anthropologically cosmopolitan in my approach to life as is conceivable, I salute Shinoda with a profound respect, and look forward to investigating as many of his other works as possible."}], "recommandations_id": [49355, 170343, 93174, 43339], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
