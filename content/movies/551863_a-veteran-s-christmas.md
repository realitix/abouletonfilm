It seems like the movie industry has forgotten  the veterans in america when creating wholesome movies. The cast was excellent especially the leading actor and actress. They delivered such a great performance that actually made you believe this was a real setting. I believe they connected with the audience they were striving to please. I am new to the Hallmark channel and am very impressed with the quality of their movies and especially the actors involved. I gave viewed many Hallmark movies and I find this on to be what I consider their best one especially concerning content and actor integration."}], "recommandations_id": [586654, 583727, 550073, 550025]}
