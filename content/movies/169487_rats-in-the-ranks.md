Incumbent Larry Hand was popular with the citizenry but they don't vote for mayor - the 12 councillors do - and after three years of Larry, at least four councillors were after his job. When film-makers Bob Connolly and Robin Anderson settled in at Leichhardt Council in early 1994 the knives were already being sharpened. A battle royal was in the making, and so it came to pass. By the end of September Larry had fought the fight of his life, with Connolly and Anderson documenting every bit of it on film.  Ambition, courage, envy, hatred, loyalty, betrayal, disaster, triumph... in other words, a classic study in politics.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3JSzzUwlH2Rs2vhk0UzFeAfzXVY.jpg", "actors": ["Larry Hand (Himself)", "Evan Jones (Himself)", "Neil Macindoe (Himself)", "Trevor Snape (Himself)", "Harry Sidaway (Himself)", "Nick Origlass (Himself)", "Bob Heffernan (Himself)", "Kate Butler (Herself)", "Kath Hacking (Herself)", "Sue Stock (Herself)", "Christine O'Brien (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
