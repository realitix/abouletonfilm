On a rainy day, I have a walk through the early Soho. I begin my walk on 80 Wooster Street and continue towards the Williamsburg bridge, where, 58 minutes later, still raining, my walk ends. As I walk, occasionally I talk about what I see or I tell some totally unrelated little stories that come to my mind as I walk.  This video was my early exercise in the one-shot video form. There are no cuts in this video.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cwdraJlC3buwkIxwPokef0HhuZq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
