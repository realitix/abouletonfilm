The series often tackled issues of race and identity and, following a clumsy start with an interview with Sir Penderel Moon, this edition is a relatively sensitive portrait of Sikhs settling in Southall and Plumstead. Interviews with young British Asians are a particular highlight and the programme also follows the story of a Delhi taxi driver hoping to move to Britain.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
