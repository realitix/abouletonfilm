As the series routinely took the format of filming scenes in chronological order, this adds to the \"show within a show within a show\" format of the film, as viewers watch the cast perform the episodes live. The film itself ends with a \"curtain call\", as the cast comes out and Arnaz thanks the audience for their support.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zeykcgvlY8jHbfpIrNX5xahnJuW.jpg", "actors": ["Lucille Ball (Lucy Ricardo)", "Desi Arnaz (Ricky Ricardo)", "Vivian Vance (Ethel Mertz)", "William Frawley (Fred Mertz)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
