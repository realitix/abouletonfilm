He escapes and meets his pal, Fuzzy Jones, in Corral City, Texas, which is taking a holiday to allow the cowpunchers of the Lazy A Ranch their periodic spree. In the saloon, Billy is recognized by Dave Hendricks and Flash, two the Lazy A's bed men, as the rider who had held them up after they had robbed the express wagon a few hours earlier. Outside, Billy is ambushed and slightly wounded, and is taken to the express office by Jim Morgan where Mary Barton, the local agent, agrees to tend him until the doctor arrives. Billy turns over the loot he took from the outlaws and he is appointed sheriff, with Fuzzy as his deputy. The Lazy A gang brings in a noted gunfighter, Gil Cooper, who turns out to be Billy's brother. Billy, Gil and Fuzzy eventually rout the outlaw gang, and Gil remains behind with Mary as Billy and Fuzzy ride off.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mlrHYwdwsZKd892CFiJyuz5UA4j.jpg", "actors": ["Bob Steele (Billy the Kid)", "Terry Walker (Mary Barton)", "Al St. John (Fuzzy)", "Carleton Young (Gil Bonney aka Gil Cooper)", "Charles King (Dave)", "John Merton (Flash)", "Frank LaRue (Jim Morgan)", "Slim Whitaker (Windy)", "Victor Adamson (Townsman)", "Bob Burns (Townsman)", "Ben Corbett (Townsman)", "Art Dillard (Henchman)", "Curley Dresden (Henchman Who Shoots Billy)", "Jack Evans (Townsman)", "Oscar Gahan (Barfly Watching Fight)", "Augie Gomez (Henchman Pete)", "Herman Hack (Townsman)", "Chick Hannan (Henchman)", "Al Haskell (Barfly Watching Fight)", "Jack Hendricks (Barfly)", "Merrill McCormick (Townsman)", "Lew Meehan (Saloon Keeper)", "George Morrell (Barfly Watching Fight)", "Tex Palmer (Townsman)", "James Sheridan (Townsman)", "Pascale Perry (Henchman)", "Pascale Perry (Posse Rider)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
