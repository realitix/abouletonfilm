Blaine stood encased in a massive block of ice located in Times Square, New York City. He was lightly dressed and seen to be shivering even before the blocks of ice were sealed around him. A tube supplied him with air and water while his urine was removed with another tube. He was encased in the box of ice for 63 hours, 42 minutes and 15 seconds before being removed with chain saws. The ice was transparent and resting on an elevated platform to show that he was actually inside the ice the entire time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A2UsBLMRcbZrXBNMFbE6ua2E1a9.jpg", "actors": ["David Blaine (Himself)", "Lenny Kravitz (Himself - Guest Appearance)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
