During two years, always with a camera on him, he observed and interacted with all kinds of metro 'inhabitants': passengers, bill posters, homeless persons, musicians, metro drivers, frequently conversing about life expectations. The result is a film that reveals this eclectic underground world from an unusual, irreverent and personal point of view.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/BNhyhQA3KfYqcnmDbD8fCcRls0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
