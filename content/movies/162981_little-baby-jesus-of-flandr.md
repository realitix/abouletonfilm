Their plan is a triumph and they sing themselves rich. On the way back to the pub however, they get lost in the woods and witness the birth of Little Baby Jesus. Bedazzled by this miracle they decide to give away all their gifts. When next year Christmas is around, they decide to sing again. But puzzled by last year experience, they start to quarrel over the gifts. Our three friends fall apart and each go their own way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e95d3lxJRFQcV1YhkYjIuzCnDUw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [47238], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
