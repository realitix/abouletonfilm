Set in the High Sierras at the end of the Civil War, the \"wild girl\" of the title is Salome Jane Clay (Joan Bennett). Rather tomboyish and determined, she isn't the vixen that the title suggests; as a matter of fact, she is upset and angry over a man who has tried to take liberties with her. A stranger Charles Farrell shows up, looking for the same man who has incurred Jane's enmity. Farrell has a score to settle, for this man ruined the life and reputation of Farrell's sister. He shoots him, then flees the town with Jane's help. They are pursued by numerous individuals; as they overcome various obstacles, they find themselves falling in love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vj2ASG8f0VgVwgwlnF31NWo5niA.jpg", "actors": ["Charles Farrell (Billy, the Stranger)", "Joan Bennett (Salomy Jane)", "Ralph Bellamy (Jack Marbury)", "Eugene Pallette (Yuba Bill)", "Irving Pichel (Rufe Waters)", "Minna Gombell (Millie, the Prostitute)", "Willard Robertson (Red Pete)", "Sarah Padden (Lize)", "Morgan Wallace (Phineas Baldwin)", "James Durkin (Madison Clay)", "Robert Homans (Sheriff / Gambling Kibitzer)", "Murdock MacQuarrie (Jess Larabee)", "Ferdinand Munier (Col.
