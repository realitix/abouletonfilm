Thus, his braying laughter and public declarations of love for village maidens only win laughter rather than anger, beatings or worse. However, Haneen, a wandering Muslim holy man, perceives something more in this figure of fun: genuine piety and an inner radiance, marked by a powerful spiritual intelligence. One other person sees more in Zein than most do- the beautiful, pious and sedate young girl in the village.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2ucdQQMuqIGEsI35OYECVijWVPE.jpg", "actors": ["Ali Mahdi (Zein)", "Ibrahim Hujazi (Haneen)", "Tahiya Zaroug (Nama)", "Sunni Dafallah ()", "Mohamed Khairi ()", "Soraya Roro ()", "Awad Siddig ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
