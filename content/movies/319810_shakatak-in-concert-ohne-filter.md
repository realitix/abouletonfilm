This Ohne Filter performance was filmed in the band's prime, in October 1985. Tracks include \"Dark Is the Night,\" \"Day By Day,\" \"City Rhythm,\" \"Easier Said Than Done\" and much more.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
