It was an Oscar Nominee for Best Animated Short in 1991.\r Each piece of history is presented as a simple vignette, usually depicting a few simply-drawn characters arguing and making war, over and over again. Generally, a single figure is meant to stand in for an entire group (i.e., a single Caesar-like caricature for the entire line of Roman Emperors). There is very little spoken dialogue; instead, most of the cartoon is accompanied by a bouncy piano-driven score, which frequently changes style to suit the particular historical era. However, the score is all based around a single simple theme, to which it frequently returns in between vignettes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a4utjccWeQWrvpETL789yuWSV6D.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [85791, 84886, 315647, 160332], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
