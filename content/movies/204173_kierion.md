He starts by tracking down the American journalist's girlfriend but discovers that she has been murdered as well. Eventually, it becomes clear that Greek oil executives, in collusion with the government, killed the journalist in order to conceal plans to nationalize foreign oil companies; this is a move from which they profited. This film was banned in Greece when it was produced in 1962 and was not released there until there was a change in government.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eTpnXhdllRtSsRREQZ1jXuCz58Z.jpg", "actors": ["Anestis Vlahos (Aimos Vagenas)", "Kyriakos Katzourakis (zadik)", "Eleni Theofilou ()", "Dimos Starenios ()", "Elli Xanthaki ()", "Stavros Tornes (George Morgan)", "Kostas Sfikas ()", "Grigoris Masalas ()", "Gianni Detone ()", "Theo Angelopoulos ()", "Titika Vlahopoulou ()", "Ritsa Barkia ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
