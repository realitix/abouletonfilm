This, however, leads to conflicts: up to now, Susanne has been living with Wolfgang, a biologist. This shared life was harmonious and based on mutual trust. Wolfgang is not only resolute and in full command of social situations; he has also always been the stabilizing force in the relationship. This is precisely why Susanne now feels drawn to the unsettled, unsteady and frivolous Christian, the complete opposite of the calm, well-balanced Wolfgang. And Christian, working as a shift boss on a natural gas derrick, has become more aware of his personal and social responsibilities as a result of loving Susanne.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i7NjmND5iMhTSCbAo7YSZyOccHt.jpg", "actors": ["Heidemarie Wenzel (Susanne Krug)", "Winfried Glatzeder (Christian Smolny)", "J\u00fcrgen Hentsch (Wolfgang Fischer)", "Hilmar Baumann (Max Schlosser)", "Petra Hinze (Gisela Erdmann)", "Volkmar Kleinert (Einstein)", "Wolfgang Winkler (Karl Kramer)", "Manfred Borges (Eduard)", "Reimar Johannes Baur (L\u00f6ffler)", "Herbert Wolf Krause (Petrus)", "Carmen-Maja Antoni (Junge B\u00e4uerin)", "Christa Pasemann (Gast)", "G\u00fcnter Zsch\u00e4ckel ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
