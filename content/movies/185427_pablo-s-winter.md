Why? Because his wife, family and doctor say he should. But Pablo is a stubborn man. He has worked in the mercury mines of Almad\u00e9n, Spain, risking his life daily. He has had five severe heart attacks and smoked 20 Winston's a day since he was 12. Now in his seventies, Pablo spends most of his day in front of the TV, surrounded by a cloud of smoke, with his back turned firmly towards a village that has lived through better times. Pablo represents the last generation of Almad\u00e9n mercury miners, an age-old profession with over 2,000 years of history. Through a straightforward depiction of life's everyday moments, Pablo's Winter explores the decay of the local mining culture, but above all, pays homage to its real protagonists: the miners and their families.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kQoz3vu0jxtU6xwDZdTUQeep1JR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
