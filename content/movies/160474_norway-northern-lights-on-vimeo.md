All sequences are shot in or close to Troms\u00f8 in Northern Norway.\r I have spent over 6months collecting footage for this, I have shot approx 50.000 stills to choose from in making this video. A goal for me has been to try to preserve the real-time speed of the northern lights, or come as close as possible, and present it the way I experienced it, instead of the northern lights just flashing over the sky in the blink of an eye.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mLrAHyaaePVA2owIWYFdS8D81nZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
