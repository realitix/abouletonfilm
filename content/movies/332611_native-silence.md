Joyce, a recovered drug-addict and now mental-health worker, and Paulette, a mother who 'doesn't associate' with the Natives in her town, were two such children. Their stories reflect the struggle that they and many others faced growing up as Native American within larger non-Indian culture.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
