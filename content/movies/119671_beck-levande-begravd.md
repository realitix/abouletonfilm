Martin Beck and his police team initially suspect a highly criminal MC-leader of the attack, but one pretty soon has to re-evaluate the case once the MC-leader is found murdered in a similar wooden box. Soon, more wooden boxes are found and the police realize that they are part of a cat and mouse game with a crazy serial killer. The investigation soon shows that there is a vague connection between the victims in the shape of a 9 year old event, but what Martin Beck does not suspect is that his own life too is at stake, as the murderer has chosen him as the next victim.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qvPoA0BVaMfzVruwHpXnzEno3l.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Haber (Martin Beck)", "Mikael Persbrandt (Gunvald Larsson)", "M\u00e5ns Nathanaelson (Oskar Bergman)", "Stina Rautelin (Lena Klingstr\u00f6m)", "Rebecka Hemse (Inger)", "Ingvar Hirdwall (Grannen)", "Peter H\u00fcttner (Oljelund)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [270117, 164431, 137190, 270043], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
