Taking their cue from the work of experimental pioneers such as Andy Warhol, these visual meditations explore the limits of avant-garde filmmaking. \"Adoration\" links love and cannibalism; \"Pig\" examines the mind of killer; and \"Le Poem\" melds an autopsy with an Arthur Rimbaud poem. Other entries include \"Hollywood Babylon\" and \"Dislandia.\"", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
