Kanniah (Prakashraj), who has been looking for a break as an actor for even longer than Saravanan, becomes Saravanan's roommate. When Saravanan goes to Hyderabad, Kanniah copies Saravanan's script and pitches it a producer, under the condition that he has to play the hero in the film. Impressed by the script, the producer agrees to the condition. The movie turns Kanniah, now rechristened Dilipkanth, into a star. Saravanan does not give up and creates another story. However, he finds out that he can't make his film unless Dilipkanth plays the hero.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gHPigUVPzGjC9AqNBA7L8rmG0YM.jpg", "actors": ["Prakash Raj (Kannaiah / Dileep)", "Prithviraj Sukumaran (Saravanan)", "Gopika (Mythili)", "Sarath Babu (Balaji)", "M.
