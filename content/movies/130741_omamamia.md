Her permanently anxious and stressed daughter, Marie, knows exactly where: the neighbourhood\u2019s idyllically situated retirement homem where she can find friends of \u201cher own age\u201d. But Granny has other ideas: She wants to see the Pope in Rome, and no one can stop her plan. She wants to finally confess a troubling sin to the highest possible power. She resolves to make the journey alone, and ends up one day on the doorstep of her granddaughter, Martina. What she doesn\u2019t know is that Martina has a secret too, and that a private audience with the Pope is virtually impossible for mere mortals. Together with sly bon vivant, Lorenzo, the three set off on an adventure \u2013 but their attempt to receive a Papal blessing almost ends in disaster.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r1sfYDZzy9xokoNS5d0TqhD89yt.jpg", "actors": ["Marianne S\u00e4gebrecht (Oma Marguerita)", "Annette Frier (Marie)", "Miriam Stein (Martina)", "Giancarlo Giannini (Lorenzo)", "Raz Degan (Silvio)", "Nadine Arents (Chantal)", "Felix Hellmann (Reinhold)", "Helmut Markwort (Kardinal)", "Thomas Kylau (Papst Benedict III)", "Jonas Holdenrieder (Vincent)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
