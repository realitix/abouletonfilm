Each of us unknowingly consumes genetically engineered food on a daily basis. The risks and effects to our health and the environment are largely unknown. Yet more and more studies are being conducted around the world, which only provide even more reason for concern. We are the oblivious guinea pigs for wide-scale experimentation of modern biotechnology. GMO OMG tells the story of a fathers discovery of GMOs in relationship to his 3 young children and the world around him. We still have time to heal the planet, feed the world, and live sustainably. But we have to start now!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5OOGB2cqhGOL7eq8ko0KjlCdVvZ.jpg", "actors": ["Dennis Kucinich (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [112666, 77670, 19014, 404279], "youtube_key": "ynyB2fNn8kQ"}
