At 17, Sherman Oaks high schooler Pam Banner has a baby out of wedlock. The baby is adopted, but Pam's too embarrassed to go back to school, so her dad gets her a job as the receptionist for a talent agent. A rock star takes her to a party, seduces and abandons her; that starts a spiral of partying, free love, and drug use. Pam becomes friends with Jeannie, a hooker who supports Jimmy, a useless druggie. Soon the three of them are living together, and Jimmy seems appealing to Pam. She's missing work more and more often, Jeannie wants out of the life, Jimmy is going through withdrawal, and Pam is in the middle of a maelstrom. Is there any exit for Pam?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pbt0ZVxQHtH4iX7jAYgNxJi2gno.jpg", "actors": ["Connie Nelson (Pamela Banner)", "John Alderman (Jimmy Devlin)", "Catherine Howard (Jeannie)", "Gary Kent (Leo)", "Liz Renay (Mrs. Banner)", "William Bonner (Chad)", "Bruce Kimball (Prison Guard)", "R.
