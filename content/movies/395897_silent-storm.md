Silent Storm reveals the story behind this astonishing case of officially sanctioned \"body-snatching\". Set against a backdrop of the Cold War, the saga follows celebrated scientist, Hedley Marston, as he attempts to blow the whistle on radioactive contamination and challenge official claims that British atomic tests posed no threat to the Australian people. Marston's findings are not only disputed, he is targeted as \"a scientist of counter-espionage interest\". Now, questions are being raised about the health repercussions for generations of Australians.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7sdlK6BNAoP4NFJLyINpAe4mTLL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
