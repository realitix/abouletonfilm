During a few days at a vacation home, Katha (Birgitta Valberg), a woman in late middle age, tries to cope with an influx of discontented, disconnected relatives. Her divorced daughter brings all sorts of people to the house, including a woman-friend accompanied by her psychotic son; the grandfather of the house is convinced he is dying and is satisfied by nothing; and some friends drop off their angry teenage son to stay with her, while they go on a long trip abroad. Her friend Emma (Sif Ruud) doesn't help much with keeping a lid on things, as she is a social worker who is fascinated by the awfulness of these situations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gMF5FG141ItdIbx5AvoKHmhhXyi.jpg", "actors": ["Marianne Aminoff (Christina)", "Maria Blomkvist (Eva)", "Anna Borg (Kajsa)", "Margaretha Bystr\u00f6m (Annika)", "Agneta Ekmanner (Sassa)", "Pontus Gustafsson (Tomas)", "Mats Helander (Andreas)", "Inga Landgr\u00e9 (Saga)", "Dagny Lind (Alma)", "Oscar Ljung (Arthur)", "Holger L\u00f6wenadler (Wilhelm)", "Toni Magnusson (King)", "Per Myrberg (Ture)", "G\u00f6sta Pr\u00fczelius (Carl-Henrik)", "Sif Ruud (Emma)", "G\u00f6ran Stangertz (Puss)", "Solveig Ternstr\u00f6m (Ingrid)", "Birgitta Valberg (Katha)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
