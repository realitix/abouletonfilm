The Incomplete Deer Hunter 3 is pure, uncontrolled chaos with bigger laughs. Billy &amp; Willy once again host the \"award-winning\" Spotlight on Deer (they swear they've won awards) with returning guests Ben Gordon, Daryl Blanda and Marvie Wafflehouse. What they didn't count on was a visit from the S.W.A.T. Team! Buck and Coach Buck once again are caught basking in the glory of another successful season... uh, until Coach Buck finds love on the internet! Foxworthy unveils \"This Old Deer Camp\" and you'll be amazed how quick (and cheap) it is to make your hunting camp more \"user friendly!\" Also ordered by the court to attend (and pass) a Hunter Safety Course, Billy And Willy give new meaning to classroom etiquette. Jeff presents a hilarious list of \"You might be a redneck if...\" and the infamous T-Bone (Willy's cousin/uncle) makes his earth-shattering debut! Plus, more laughs than you can handle!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d7v26Q0YurBLJ6MP4MhSpQBSvwV.jpg", "actors": ["Jeff Foxworthy ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
