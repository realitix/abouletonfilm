Stranded takes a look at the role four musicians from suburban Brisbane played in the explosion of one of the all time greatest musical movements. Featuring interviews with the members of the band, including its leaders Ed Kuepper and Chris Bailey, as well as the likes of Sir Bob geldof, former Dead Kennedys frontman Jello Biafra and Buzzcocks guitarist Steve Diggle, Stranded examines how the oppresive and conservative government of Joh Bjelke-Peterson in the 1970s helped act as a catalyst for the rise of punk rock in Australia, and how as a result The Saints went on to be one of the most influential bands in the country.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gqYwnXNWfD8SYZgyJ8Znyu8ISan.jpg", "actors": ["Neil Pigot (Narrator)", "Chris Bailey (Self)", "Ed Kuepper (Self)", "Nick Cave (Self)", "Jello Biafra (Self)", "Bob Geldof (Self)", "Steve Diggle (Self)", "Kym Bradshaw (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
