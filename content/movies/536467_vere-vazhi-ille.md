One day, he accepts a job from his former employer at a security agency, who offers him RM3,000 for a 2-day and 1-night job as security guard at a soon-to-be shut down shopping complex building. Maniam, the former Head of Security, gives Surya a tour in the building and tells him that the most suspicious and dangerous place he should avoid is the sixth floor, which is currently rented by a religious yoga group led by `Swamiji` (priest). They are up to no good as they plan to summon and trap spirits in dead bodies so that they can control them. When the door to the spirit world is opened, dozens are possessed and turned into flesh eating Zombies. The only way to stop the Zombies is to get the Black Magic Book located on the sixth floor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/85OLEh0yeOGmEyFHz22G1aJHF4F.jpg", "actors": ["Denes Kumar ()", "Jasmine Michael ()", "Sai Prashanth ()", "Janani K.
