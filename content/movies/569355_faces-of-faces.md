These images often appear to be one fantastic undulating face perpetually changing. The images are shot thru a circular mat in an attempt to get away from the dominant rectangular film image (much as earlier filmmakers have done). I have recently added a sound track, on separate cassette tape. It is the Talking Head\u2019s \u2018Seen and Not Seen.\u2019 The film can be viewed with or without the track\u2014or first with, then without.
