Disgruntled with Lajjo, who is unable to distinguish salt from sugar, he keeps to himself, and decides to re-locate to Bombay when he finds out that his mother had mortgaged their house to pay for his education. After notifying them that he has secured employment, he does not write for several months. As a result, Lajjo travels to Bombay, locates his residence and moves-in.
