I told them, why did they want me to make it - didn't they know I was a bit unusual? ... 'We want something unusual,' they said. So I went out and made a newsreel on arts. Show people looked at the rough cut of the film and became very angry. 'But there is nothing about Show Magazine and DuPont fabrics in the movie,' they said. 'What has that to do with the arts in New York!' I said. The battle was short. The film was destroyed. Really, I have no idea what they did with it. This workprint of the first FILM MAGAZINE OF THE ARTS is the only print in existence, as far as I know.\" -- J.M.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eWtAiq2NzJl9n977rkHO29tTWz6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
