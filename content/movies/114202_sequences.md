The three episodes are joined together by one film crew at work on two different jobs. In the beginning, the crew is introduced as they juggle their dual roles as State-supported propagandists who laud their government and society, and as private movie makers working on their own film. Next, they are in a restaurant looking for suitable locations to film when the eatery\u2019s owner, through no fault of his own, is induced to wax long and lugubriously on his miserable life. In the last segment, two extras are in the background of a scene, sitting at a table in a restaurant. It slowly becomes apparent to one of them that the man he\u2019s sitting with tortured him more than 40 years ago at a Nazi concentration camp during World War II.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ySGH4dDJDpAYzUQ1TNRdT0NVYlw.jpg", "actors": ["Geo Barton (Papasha)", "Ion V\u00e2lcu (movie extra)", "Emilia Dobrin (herself)", "Mircea Diaconu (motel keeper)", "Dragos P\u00eeslaru (lonely young man)", "Alexandru Tatos (himself)", "Constantin Draganescu ()", "Ioana Manolescu ()", "Nicolae Budescu ()", "Ileana Codarcea ()", "George Paul Avram ()", "Valeriu Buciu ()", "Lupu Buznea ()", "Lumini\u021ba Gheorghiu ()", "Vladimir Juravle ()", "Cristina Minculescu ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
