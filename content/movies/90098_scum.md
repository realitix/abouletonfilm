Luckily the regime has changed since this TV film was made. The brutal regime made no attempt to reform or improve the inmates and actively encouraged a power struggle between the 'tough' new inmate and the 'old hands'. Banned by the BBC for 14 years, the original television version of 'Scum' was finally aired in July 1991.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6oaZtykIShhxrVVXEJ5nVhGzE2o.jpg", "actors": ["Ray Winstone (Carlin)", "David Threlfall (Archer)", "Martin Phillips (Davis)", "Davidson Knight (Angel)", "John Blundell (Banks)", "Phil Daniels (Richards)", "Ray Burdis (Eckersley)", "Patrick Murray (Dougan)", "Ian Sharrock (Rhodes)", "Tony London (Woods)", "Peter Kinley (Betts)", "Sheridan Earl Russell (Jackson)", "Colin Mayes (Sumner)", "Trevor Butler (Toyne)", "Philip Da Costa (Formby)", "Peter Francis (Baldy)", "Richard Butler (Governor)", "John Judd (Sands)", "Bay White (Matron)", "Peter Gordon (Goodyear)", "Stewart Harwood (Greaves)", "Robin Hopwood (Burton)", "Dennis Castle (Duke)", "David Stockton (White)", "Julian Hudson (PT Instructor)", "George Lee (Chief Officer)", "Sean Hopwood (Black Officer #1)", "Joe Fordham (Black Officer #3)", "Steven Butler (Trainee)", "Michael Deeks (Trainee)", "Mark Dunn (Trainee)", "Christopher Gilbert (Trainee)", "Simon Howe (Trainee)", "Mike Mungaven (Trainee)", "Reggie Ranjha (Trainee)", "William Vanderpuye (Trainee)", "Ray Jewers (Black Officer #2)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [25476, 35944, 23599, 54613], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
