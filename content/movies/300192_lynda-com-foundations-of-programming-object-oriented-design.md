However, object-orientation itself is not a language; it's simply a set of ideas and concepts.  Let Simon Allardice introduce you to the terms\u2014words like abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, subclass\u2014and guide you through defining your requirements and identifying use cases for your program. The course also covers creating conceptual models of your program with design patterns, class and sequence diagrams, and unified modeling language (UML) tools, and then shows how to convert the diagrams into code.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bThZymRGvwTnfDfuKUSezzXRG8N.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
