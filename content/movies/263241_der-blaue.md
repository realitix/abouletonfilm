The former East German agent is Otto Skrodt who after many years is about to be promoted in the highest government ranks. He is anxious to maintain a squeaky clean image. His daughter is Isabelle. The young and friendly Kalle returns after spending many years in jail for his escape attempts. He doesn't know exactly who blew the whistle, but his friend Skrodt is definitely under suspicion. Kalle returns to ostensibly renew the friendship and to see Isabelle whom he loves. The duplicitous friendship between the two men becomes the main focus of the story which features interesting plot twists at the end.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5QQ81gJbQSgQY4YrggbIe67scGq.jpg", "actors": ["Manfred Krug (Otto Skrodt)", "Ulrich M\u00fche (Karl 'Kalle' Kaminski)", "Meret Becker (Isabelle Skrodt)", "Klaus Manchen (F\u00fchrungsoffizier Werner)", "Marijam Agischewa (Mandy Skrodt)", "Hanns Zischler (Minister)", "Margret V\u00f6lker (Brieftr\u00e4gerin)", "Jean Claude Mawila ()", "Lienhard Wawrzyn ()", "Michael Christian ()", "Anette Hellwig ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
