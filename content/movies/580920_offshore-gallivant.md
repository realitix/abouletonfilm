The attempt was witnessed by the writer and wordsmith Iain Sinclair and is narrated by Eden K\u00f6tting. The film came about in 2006 (the 10 year anniversary since the release of the original film Gallivant) and the chance discovery of a boat called The Gallivant, which offered to shadow us across the Channel as a support vessel.  Flotsam and jetsam in the form of conversations, field recordings and the voices of Gladys and Eden from the original film invade. The film shows scenes of explicit vomiting.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jRW0gpPsFb6siPA730UYoroGN7i.jpg", "actors": ["Andrew K\u00f6tting ()", "Xavier Thierry ()", "Ian Dale ()", "Sean Lock ()", "Mark K\u00f6tting ()", "Joey K\u00f6tting ()", "Eden K\u00f6tting ()", "Iain Sinclair ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
