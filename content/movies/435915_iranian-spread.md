It passes through a broad cross-section of Iranian society, stopping with a pickpocket, a pomegranate seller, an abortionist, an estate sale, a beggar, a college student, a wedding reception, some musicians, smuggling rings, and some New Year's revelers. Most of them realize it is counterfeit, but too late to take action.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
