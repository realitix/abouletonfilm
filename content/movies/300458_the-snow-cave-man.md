For the past 30 years he has been living on his own in snow caves in the Norwegian mountains. Always on the move, using a pair of old wooden skis, he goes from one snow cave to the next in search of shelter from extreme blizzards and bitingly cold wind. A true expert in outdoor survival techniques, this wilderness man refuses to be reigned in by modern society. Instead he has chosen a way of life that flies in the face of conformist consumer culture and the materialistic modern world. Sverre's life is a tale about the quest for total freedom as well as the price one pays in seeking it.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
