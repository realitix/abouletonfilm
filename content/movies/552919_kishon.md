But Kishon is first and foremost a satirist and writer whose books and plays have been translated into over 40 languages and have earned him the Israel Prize.  This documentary paints an intimate portrait of the legendary artist - a Hungarian Holocaust survivor and immigrant to the fledgling state of Israel - through interviews, archival footage, animation and in-depth conversations. The result is a captivating film that highlights Kishon\u2019s acerbic wit, playful approach to language and above all, his zest for life.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
