Always a true romantic, Elvis recorded many, many love songs throughout his career, beginning with \"I Want You, I Need You, I Love You' in 1956 and running the entire span of his life. Entire eras of his remarkable life and career can be evoked by the mere mention of the title of one of his many long songs. Mention \"Love Me Tender\" and a hundred images spring to mind. The same can be said for his many other songs of romance. Elvis and his love songs had remained an unexplored area of Elvis's remarkable career. Now, Love Me Tender...The Love Songs Of Elvis Presley tells the warm story of the tender side of the King of Rock and Roll. Narrated by Ashley Judd, Love Me Tender is Elvis as you've never seen him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qGj7hH7yiaLirKw2NvbWtFqhfuo.jpg", "actors": ["Elvis Presley (Himself)", "Ashley Judd (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
