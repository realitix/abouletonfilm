Based on a Franz Lehar operetta, the story is the usual frothy nonsense. Dolly (Charlotte Daudert) is engaged to marry Hyppolit (Heinz Ruhmann), but she's really in love with Harold (Hans Heinz-Bollman). Hyppolit is likewise enamored of another, namely Frasquita (Jarmila Novotna). Alas, Dolly and Hyppolit must go through with the wedding, despite the dictates of their hearts. That there's a happy ending all the same comes as a surprise only to the characters on the screen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bUqpqWOLCSzwX01ZKV76QGCIRqJ.jpg", "actors": ["Jarmila Novotna (Frasquita)", "Hans Heinz Bollmann (Harald)", "Heinz R\u00fchmann (Hippolit)", "Charlott Daudert (Dolly)", "Rudolf Carl (Karel)", "Hans Moser (Jaromir)", "Max G\u00fclstorff (Graf Elemer)", "Franz Schafheitlin (Juan)", "Franz Leh\u00e1r (Dirigent)", "Otto Schm\u00f6le ()", "Robert Valberg ()", "Gretl Wawra ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
