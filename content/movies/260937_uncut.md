The tale centers on the exploits of three homosexuals named Peter. Peter Koosens is obsessed with the semi-scandalous behavior of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau while college student Peter Cort, ponders the significance and necessity of male circumcision. Peter Denham is an artist who seduces the other two and freely borrows from their work to make something of his own. Their exploits land the trio in prison after an operatic number (the police sing songs adapted from Bizet's Carmen).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c9gz1JBcNt7t1xHcz636kahupiK.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Achtman (Peter Koosens)", "Matthew Ferguson (Peter Cort)", "Damon D'Oliveira (Peter Denham)", "Maria Reidstra (Officer)", "Alexandra Webb (Defense Lawyer)", "Helene Ducharme (Judge)", "Daniel MacIvor (Newscaster)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
