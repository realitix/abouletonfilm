A project has begun to do exactly that, featuring hammers dropped by Rusty, Murray, JD, Ruck, Rathy, O'Shea, Grubb, Schwenne, BT, Nicola and Jimmy LaRiche. This film promises to deliver a perspective never before captured in a wakeboard film. Director Keith Kipp, a former Hyperlite athlete, has an advantage when he's behind the lens because he's spent time in front of the cameras on his wakeboard. For the next 6 months, he and his crew will be spending time at different team's homes, in their backyards and in their faces to grab the necessary footage showcasing their talents, their personalities and their antics for you. Get ready for a ground breaking film with a hard hitting soundtrack featuring the A-Team, brought to you by Alliance Multi Media &amp; Hyperlite Wakeboards!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g540ZNcMC5iGpqX2624NMNUSSv8.jpg", "actors": ["Shaun Murray (Shaun Murray)", "Erik Ruck (Erik Ruck)", "Mike Schwenne (Mike Schwenne)", "Rusty Halinoski (Rusty Halinoski)", "Brandon Thomas (Brandon Thomas)", "Jacob Valdez (Jacob Valdez)", "JD Webb (JD Webb)", "Chris O'Shea (Chris O'Shea)", "Chris Kallas (Chris Kallas)", "Brian Grubb (Brian Grubb)", "Jimmy LaRiche (Jimmy LaRiche)", "Kyle Aiberts (Kyle Aiberts)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
