From high-toned clubs and hidden speakeasies to backwoods shacks, Prohibition did little to stop America's consumption of liquor--it just diverted the flow to different channels. RUMRUNNERS, MOONSHINERS AND BOOTLEGGERS revisits the rough-and-tumble days of Prohibition for a candid, inside look at the legacy of this tumultuous time. Former Rumrunners talk of their run-ins with the Coast Guard, and we'll see how NASCAR owes its existence to the failed attempt to dry out the nation. Authors provide a historical perspective, while retired agents and prosecutors reflect on their difficult, dangerous and ultimately futile efforts to enforce a law that America clearly did not support.Filled with extraordinary tales, rarely-seen footage and a host of captivating photos.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wlvqQh2QjJFeG8AIrLHNtiwDimA.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
