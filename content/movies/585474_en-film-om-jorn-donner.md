Author, film director, film producer, journalist, critic and politician. J\u00f6rn Donner is known for producing Fanny and Alexander and received an Oscar for it. But he has also been known for being bellicose and naturally he fights with the filmmakers Alberto Herskovits and Olavi Linna as they try to film him. He is especially cantankerous when they ask him to do something in front of the camera that he finds inane. He doesn\u2019t want to prostitute himself anymore, he wants to talk! This desire provides a key to this quick-witted man\u2019s incessant restlessness and his quarrels stand as a backdrop that facilitate the dialog Donner wants to have.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u0vDE6OP8pZNzpB9X8meR4czrEI.jpg", "actors": ["J\u00f6rn Donner (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
