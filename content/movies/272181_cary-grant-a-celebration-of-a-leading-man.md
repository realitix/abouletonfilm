His deft comic style merged easily with his strength as a romantic leading man. But the suave exterior concealed a complex and often sensitive individual. Cary's painful journey from his lonely working-class beginnings to the peak of Hollywood royalty is made vivid through family photos, archival footage, clips from many of his films -- including his first starring role in SHE DONE HIM WRONG, following his discovery by blonde bombshell Mae West. Among friends and colleagues interviewed on-screen are Leslie Caron, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Deborah Kerr, Eva Marie Saint, Ralph Bellamy, Stanley Donen, Richard Brooks and Stanley Kramer. Narrated by Richard Kiley. -  Ralph Bellamy, Richard Brooks, Michael Caine", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
