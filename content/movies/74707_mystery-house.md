When a prominent banker is murdered while on a hunting trip, the dead man's daughter, Gwen Kingery (Anne Nagel), calls in private eye Lance O'Leary (Dick Purcell) to investigate. No sooner has he started gathering clues than another murder is committed?and another?and another?.The culprit wants to cover up an embezzlement scheme, and there is certainly no shortage of suspects. Without revealing the ending, it can be noted that Mystery House offers at least one surprise when Lance O'Leary ends up falling in love not with Gwen Kingery but with wisecracking nurse Sarah Keate (Anne Sheridan). Sarah, in fact, is the leading character in the Mignon C. Eberhardt novel upon which Mystery House was based-except in the original, she's a middle-aged spinster rather than a Hollywood glamorpuss.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yKJU6tWCCMQRou6FzQHQyGF6puI.jpg", "actors": ["Dick Purcell (Lance O'Leary)", "Ann Sheridan (Nurse Sarah Keate)", "Anne Nagel (Gwen Kingery)", "William Hopper (Lal Killian)", "Anthony Averill (Julian Barre)", "Dennie Moore (Annette)", "Hugh O'Connell (Newell Morse)", "Ben Welden (Gerald Frawley)", "Sheila Bromley (Terice Von Elm)", "Elspeth Dudgeon (Aunt Lucy Kingery)", "Anderson Lawler (Joe Page)", "Trevor Bardette (Bruker)", "Jeanne Benedict (Helen Page)", "Loia Cheaney (O'Leary's Secretary)", "Stuart Holmes (Jury Foreman)", "Jack Mower (The Coroner)", "Paul Panzer (Extra at Inquest)", "Eric Stanley (Hubert Kingery)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
