Despite having made a great mural for the metro station Palais Royal \u2013 Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Santos lives isolated and ignored in his country. This documentary follows his pilgrimage to Wirikuta, where he asks gods for permission to make a new mural; his journey across 385 miles of the Peyote Route, and Santos's creative process during the making of a new mural which aims to illustrate the history, mythology and religious traditions of the Huichol people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jXNZRpc4HfFFYLft4m4UHYnS1CF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
