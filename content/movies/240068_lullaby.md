Much of the film focuses upon their happy and peaceful life of this family comprised of a young couple and their baby daughter Keto. Their life changes when two drifters come in. The two men (who seem to be Muslims from the Azerbaijan republic) are met with hospitality. They repay it by kidnapping baby Keto. ~ Sandra Brennan, All Movie Guide", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eNNJpfsEHKlZwFv7EyBNkWZxohT.jpg", "actors": ["Nato Murvanidze ()", "Niko Tavadze ()", "Nino Abuladze ()", "Maya Bagrationi ()", "Kakhi Kavsadze ()", "Otar Megvinetukhutsesi ()", "Zurab Kavtaradze ()", "Archil Tsitsishvili ()", "Natia Mokhevishvili (Angel / little girl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
