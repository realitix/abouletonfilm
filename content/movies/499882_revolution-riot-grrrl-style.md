To get their message across, these women have decided to rely on rock music! While the Pussy Riot shock Russia and fascinate the West, the concerts of Peaches or Grimes are sold out, while artists such as Kathleen Hanna make their comeback to remind us that it all began in 1990 in some backwater of the United States. The RIOT GRRRLS revolutionized rock and inspired entire generations of young artists around the world. This film will explore today s feminist scene while revisiting the little known history of this revolution that shook the early 90s.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Johanna Fateman (Herself)", "Kathleen Hanna (Herself)", "Lauren Mayberry (Herself)", "Allison Wolfe (Herself)", "Calvin Johnson (Himself)", "Rebecca Albee (Herself)", "Ramdasha Bikceem (Herself)", "Tammy Rae Garland (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "h9ve7phOiA4"}
