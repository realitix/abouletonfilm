The show, filmed at Melbourne's historic Athenaeum Theatre during his sold out tour of Australia 2009, promises more memorable tales from the globe-trotting Scotsman in his finest performance yet to date. As possibly the most-traveled comedian in the world, he describes sometimes in painfully funny detail the less glamorous side of a comedian's life on the road. Sometimes introspective, occasionally outlandish, these true stories from his life are sure to leave you with a smile on your face and wanderlust in your heart. The DVD also includes a special unreleased ?Visitor?s Guide to Scotland? as well as other extras including TV Appearances, Photo Gallery and hidden features.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/791s4MpxXhAbHUyZihBeJHrR69b.jpg", "actors": ["Danny Bhoy (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
