It now hovers like a time capsule near a man\u2019s face. He looks down, listening in on a female guerrilla fighter and translating her words from Fulani. Within the capsule, money is counted and paid out as a new currency, the numbers of the years run backwards in the black box. A 16-mm film glides through the man's hands and is transferred to a laptop screen frame by frame.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/el2F33JCyzmr1qxq0YTuQxiHA57.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
