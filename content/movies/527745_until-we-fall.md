Adam loved Louise. That is how it used to be. But a child has disappeared. Their child. The police said it was a drowning accident. Yet the truth is that their little boy\u2019s body was never found. Lucas, ten years old. How easy it all would have been if the ocean had taken the trouble to throw up a little-swollen child\u2019s corpse onto the beach. Or if a local with alcohol in his blood and blood on his hands had ploughed him down at full speed. An indescribable pain. No more living, no more happiness, but at least no unanswered questions. Unfortunately, that is not how it is for Adam and Louise.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vurZdgvw6xt10TbTEVTXubndtJi.jpg", "actors": ["Dar Salim ()", "Lisa Carlehed ()", "Francesc Garrido ()", "\u00d3scar Casas ()", "Mario de la Rosa ()", "Yaiza Guimar\u00e9 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
