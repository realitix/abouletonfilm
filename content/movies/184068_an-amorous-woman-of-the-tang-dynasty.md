Taoist priestess Yu Hsuan-chi (Pat Ha Man-chik) longs for the sort of earthy experience that a woman born to her lofty station is not expected -- or desired -- to have. While putting in an appearance with society's elite, she carries on a passionate affair with an itinerate swordsman named Tsui Po-hou (Alex Man). With both Hsuan-chi and Po-hou fighting against the tedium and hide-bound conventions of Chinese society, the two seem like a perfect match. Yet the ever restless Po-hou soon leaves her and continues on his travels. Hsuan-chi develops a reputation as an amoral libertine, partially because she is having sex with her maid Lu Chiao. After Po-hou returns and leaves her again, Hsuan-chi learns that Lu Chiao is pregnant but she refuses to divulge the name of the father. Hsuan-chi's reaction ultimately results in tragedy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1HV5rlVoajFmLUVnqQ93yVlDAdU.jpg", "actors": ["Pat Ha (Yu Yuan Gi/Yu Yao Mei)", "Alex Man Chi-Leung (Tsui Pok Hau)", "Chang Kuo-Chu (Auyang)", "Lam Hoi-Ling (Lu Chiao)", "Poon Chun-wai (Taoist Yung)", "Ku Feng (Li)", "Wang Lai (Head of the monastery)", "\u9ec3\u6a39\u68e0 (Kung Meng Wu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
