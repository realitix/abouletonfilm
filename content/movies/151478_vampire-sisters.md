Going to school, making new friends and fitting in \u2014 it\u2019s all tough when you can\u2019t just be yourself. With a vampire father and a human mother, sisters Dakaria (Daka) and Silvania don\u2019t live in your typical blended family. Each girl embraces a different side of her genetic makeup: Daka wishes she was 100% vampire; Silvania wishes she was 100% human; and both believe they can finally realize their hearts\u2019 desires when the opportunity to change presents itself. Will Daka and Silvania realize that, sometimes, your uniqueness is your greatest strength?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5rFx5oohUMTzPdQAmqQ9pXh4njE.jpg", "actors": ["Marta Martin (Silvania Tepes)", "Stipe Erceg (Mihai Tepes)", "Laura Roge (Dakaria)", "Jamie Bick (Helene Steinbr\u00fcck)", "Christiane Paul (Elvira Tepes)", "Richy M\u00fcller (Ali Bin Schick)", "Michael Kessler (Dirk van Kombast)", "Jonas Holdenrieder (Ludo Schwarzer)", "Viola von der Burg (Frau Renneberg)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [298504, 392476, 360615, 357684], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
