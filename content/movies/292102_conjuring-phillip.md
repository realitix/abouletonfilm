A group of researchers appear to have made contact with an entity by the name of Philip. It is possible that Philip was not really a ghost and that the strange events were just the result of manifestations from group consciousness. Maybe it was all just the result of psychokinesis or a big trick the researchers played on themselves. At the core of the investigation are belief, immortality and science.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
