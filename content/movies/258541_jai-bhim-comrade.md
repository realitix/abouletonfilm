Also known as \u201cthe untouchable,\u201d this group was vindicated by Bihmrao Ambedkar, a Dalit who earned doctorate degrees abroad and fought for the emancipation of his people. In 1997 a statue made for honoring him was desecrated, unleashing the rage of the Dalit community; but instead of getting support by the authorities, ten persons were murdered.
