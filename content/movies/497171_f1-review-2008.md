Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen wanted to defend his title but it was team mate Felipe Massa who led Ferrari's charge. Robert Kubica emerged as a surprise threat. But it was Lewis Hamilton who got the job done.\r Almost four hours of highlights. The best bits of what you saw and all the things you didn\u2019t!
