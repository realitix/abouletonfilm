In particular it was essential to delay or stop the movement of 2 SS Pz Div (Das Reich) from the south of France. The initial plan called for the French Resistance to interdict the French Railway system to stop their movements. Doubts over the effectiveness of the resistance led to the deployment of 1st SAS to do the task. This programme covers both the deployment of a troop of B Sqn into the Poitiers, in what was known as OP BULBASKET, to delay the Das Reich and the movements and actions of the Das Reich as they move through the Dordogne and Vienne Regions culminating in the massacre at Oradour. Part 2 of this programme will cover the SAS actions in delaying the Das Reich.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k9DqK9KO7Gy4AKeYavCCo1DaIDU.jpg", "actors": ["Andy Johnson (Presenter)", "Tom Dormer (Presenter)", "Andrew Duff (Presenter)", "Tim Saunders (Presenter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "YcxG9avJDfw"}
