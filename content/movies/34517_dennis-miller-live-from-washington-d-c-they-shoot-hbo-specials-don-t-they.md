In fact, this was filmed right before Miller got Miller Live. Funny stuff as he talks about the new president, his kid, and other random rants. Not his definite best, but he isn't terrible. Of course that's just my opinion, I could be wrong, and the balcony is now closed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cKqWkL4OquiYMdVMsvzU8U4Ijl.jpg", "actors": ["Dennis Miller (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
