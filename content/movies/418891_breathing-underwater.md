These women still exist and they still dive the old way, without tanks. They go into the waters of 10- to 20-meter depth to harvest seaweed and shellfish to make a living. They make a living in the same sea, but each haenyeo\u2019s sea of life is different. The community is divided into three tiers- Group A, B and C, based on skills and capabilities. One\u2019s rank is determined by sum or breath. Sum, is pre-determined at birth. Therefore, sum is desired. However, the ocean is harsh. May you desire! But seek what is not yours, the ocean will devour you. Life, for these women of the sea, is about holding one\u2019s breath, and containing and controlling one\u2019s desire. The film is a six year record of the lives of the haenyeos in Udo, an islet in the province of Jeju, known to be the birthplace of haenyeo. It is a close look into the lives that stand on the boundary of life and death.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kDNpX7l03L5w3Ma5FXPpQehPcQE.jpg", "actors": ["Koh Hee-young (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
