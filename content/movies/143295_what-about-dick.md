The Piano (Eric Idle) narrates the tale of Dick (Russell Brand); his two cousins: Emma, (Jane Leeves) an emotionally retarded English girl; her kleptomaniac sister Helena (Sophie Winkleman) and their dipsomaniac Aunt Maggie (Tracey Ullman) who all live together in a large, rambling, Edwardian novel.  When the Reverend Whoopsie (Tim Curry) discovers a piano on a beach, a plot is set afoot that can be solved only by a private Dick, the incomprehensible Scottish sleuth Inspector McGuffin (Billy Connolly) who with the aid of Sergeant Ken Russell (Jim Piddock) finally reveals the identity of the Houndsditch Mutilator.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/TYSEePWEX0B19QrdslJNsU92QY.jpg", "actors": ["Eddie Izzard (Deepak Rushdie Obi Ben Kingsley)", "Eric Idle (The Piano)", "Russell Brand (Dick)", "Jane Leeves (Emma)", "Sophie Winkleman (Helena)", "Tracey Ullman (Aunt Maggie)", "Tim Curry (Reverend Whoopsie)", "Billy Connolly (Inspector McGuffin)", "Jim Piddock (Sergeant Ken Russell)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "uSyO8vnOKe0"}
