In this surreal puzzle film, Dichter turns from his wife to a private journal to record his deepest fears. Anna knows her husband lives in a waking nightmare where delusions and reality blend, but is powerless to help him. As Arthur's disease gives way to despair, loneliness, and alienation, he and Anna hang onto their last shred of hope. This atmospheric film explores personal identity, marital discord, and contemporary life, turning narrative and chronology inside out to find the darkest corners of the human spirit.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/we7HGg7CFoPXsN4v3ds2RtxXZHd.jpg", "actors": ["David Connolly (Arthur Dichter)", "Sarah Lassez (Anna Dichter)", "Michael T.
