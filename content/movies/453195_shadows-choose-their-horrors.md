Sinister forces surround Madame G (Winsome Brown) as she tries to bond with her favorite undead. Using magic and ritual to give them new life and pleasures, Madame G is shocked by the devastating outcome. This camp and experimental reworking of early silent horror was inspired by both the un-staged Aaron Copland ballet Grohg, and the film that stirred the young Copland to write his ballet, Nosferatu.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wI5FQ53OuqVmoEcbF7iWtOmLWTM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
