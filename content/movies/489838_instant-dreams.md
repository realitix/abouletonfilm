In this ambitious visual essay, Willem Baptist explores the visionary genius of Edwin H. Land, the inventor of the Polaroid camera. Even today, all sorts of people are keeping his instant dream alive. Former Polaroid employee Stephen Herchen moved from the United States to Europe to work in a laboratory developing the 2.0 version of Polaroid. Christopher Bonanos, the author of Instant: The Story of Polaroid, tells us, \"When I heard Polaroid would stop making film, it felt like a close friend had died.\" Artist Stefanie Schneider, who is working with the last of her stock of Polaroid film, is using the blurring that occurs with expired film as an additional aesthetic layer in her photographic work.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5XGo4Nimn3QmN15ItMB4jXY9tzH.jpg", "actors": ["Stephen Herchen (Himself - The Scientist)", "Stefanie Schneider (Herself - The Artist)", "Christopher Bonanos (Himself - The Writer)", "Caitlin Fowler (Herself - The Model)", "Udo Kier (The Docter (Cameo))", "Edwin H.
