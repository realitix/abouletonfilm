Claretta met Mussolini in the mid-'30s and remained with him after he was dismissed in 1943 by King Victor Emmanuel (American and Allied forces invaded Sicily and started north to Rome at that time). Claretta's family also fled to the north, where Mussolini was set up in a puppet dictatorship by the Germans until the end of the war. Photographs of Mussolini and Claretta hanging from a gas-station pole in 1945 while crowds stare at their bodies were disseminated worldwide, yet information on them has been kept in the classified files of the Italian government. In this docudrama, Claretta is played by Claudia Cardinale and Claretta's younger sister Miriam Petacci, still alive in 1984, plays herself as she \"meets\" with a television reporter at Claretta's tomb to talk about her famous sister's life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nymGxPKjOne1DJQWOTQahR0unyi.jpg", "actors": ["Claudia Cardinale (Miriam Petacci)", "Giuliano Gemma (Marcello Petacci)", "Caterina Boratto (Giuseppina Petacci)", "Fernando Briamo (Benito Mussolini)", "Nancy Brilli (Young Miriam Petacci)", "Raffaele Curi (Carabinieri Lieutenant)", "Sasha D'Arc (Musician)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
