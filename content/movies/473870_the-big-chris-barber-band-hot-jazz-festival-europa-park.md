This DVD celebrates his fiftieth anniversary as a professional musician. Recorded at Germany's Hot Jazz Festival 2002, he presents his new, eleven piece Big Chris Barber Band. And what a pleasure it is - the trombonist and his virtuoso bandmates confidently switch between New Orleans jazz and a tribute to the great Duke Ellington, playing swinging blues, and managing to inject new life into old favorites like Sweet Georgia Brown.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6Swd4Yxu2YhdsCrvDaH3xh2cJ3d.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
