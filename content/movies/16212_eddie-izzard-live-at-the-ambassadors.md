The show originally had a 4 week run, which was extended twice due to the popularity of the performance. Later released as his first video, titled \"Live at the Ambassadors\", the show lead to Izzard being invited to the Just For Laughs Montreal Comedy Festival, awarded a British Comedy Award for \"Top Stand Up Comedian\", and receiving an Olivier Award nomination for \"Outstanding Achievement\". Live at the Ambassadors is an example of Izzard's very early and less refined style of stand up. His bizarre sense of humour has remained the same throughout performances, and various themes and ideas that can be seen in later recordings can be identified in Live at the Ambassadors.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sonUxBASZNKBfqU7SKMJCJlwKB2.jpg", "actors": ["Eddie Izzard (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [369665, 44220, 75874, 485071], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
