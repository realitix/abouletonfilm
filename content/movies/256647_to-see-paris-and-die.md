To ensure his success, she denies her love for an iconoclastic painter for whom she models, prostitutes herself to a Party figure, encourages her son to break with his true love because the girl is a Jew, and, in general, behaves in paranoid ways, believing, for example, that a new lodger, Evgeny, is a KGB spy. She also has her own family secrets, which she will go to any length to keep her son from learning.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iDFjs6Am2Mq2VbGEgCWwC9NSVL4.jpg", "actors": ["Dmitriy Malikov (Yuri)", "Tatyana Vasileva (Elena)", "Vladimir Steklov ()", "Stanislav Lyubshin ()", "Ekaterina Semenova ()", "Oksana Arbuzova ()", "Nina Usatova ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
