In 1948, a young man, a boy, and a waiter are captivated during the full moon by a mysterious woman in a  lilac dress. The effects of this event ripple across the years, washing over more than 80 characters, including a disc jockey, a fairy princess, a gangster, Alexander Pushkin, and a nostalgic dog.
