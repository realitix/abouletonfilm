Hoping for change, Ema (Jana Plodkov\u00e1) runs away from her family and leaves her husband. She hides at the apartment of her hairdresser, a gay guy Tony (Ondrej Nos\u00e1lek), even though she barely knows him. At the beginning they are merely two strangers, connected by their mutual effort of escaping from their families. They get closer and help each other to overcome the internal, as well as external, obstacles of their lives. Their liberating friendship almost becomes a love affair, despite the fact it cannot be fulfilled. This liberation creates an intense bond between them: a new escape, a new quest. This is a love story of two people and their attempts to escape the trap of their own desires of belonging to somebody.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3gBqG2dfWKFEN9J8BCgFZF2Asue.jpg", "actors": ["Jana Plodkov\u00e1 ()", "Ond\u0159ej Nos\u00e1lek (Tony)", "Adam Mi\u0161\u00edk ()", "Lud\u011bk Sobota ()", "Ond\u0159ej Mal\u00fd ()", "Ji\u0159\u00ed Vyor\u00e1lek ()", "Milena Steinmasslov\u00e1 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
