In this, at least, they are no different from other boys their age. But they are different in one crucial way, because nine-year-old Daniel and Habtom and Yohannes, both aged 12, live on the street, sleeping in an abandoned car on the side of the road. Without money or any form of adult support, they struggle to survive in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia. And there are around 270,000 other street kids like them. The film records the three boys\u2019 daily lives without being overly sentimental.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/25gPPbTgwOYsYvF7uMKqAG4Jhvf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "w1D_GJLXKac"}
