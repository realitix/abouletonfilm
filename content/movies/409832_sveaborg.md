In 1906 Russia had about 12 thousand troops stationed in Sveaborg fortress. The riots were provoked by the Socialist - Revolutionaries who spread influence on the minds of Sveaborg garrison. First acts of un-subordination broke on July 17, 1906, when revolutionary sailors were supported by mine-men. Minemen were arrested and disarmed by the infantry regiment. Gunners decided to release their comrades. The following fight ignited a bloody revolt, that was headed by lieutenants A. Yemelyanov and Y. Kohansky, members of the Lenin's Bolshevik party. A general strike began in Helsinki on the next day. The revolt lasted three days and was crushed by the Baltic Fleet naval bombardment. Over 40 men were executed, hundreds were sentenced to prison.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tWLb5zrGxb1CtM64uuTQsdavMBz.jpg", "actors": ["Boris Galkin ()", "Igor Gorbachyov ()", "Aleksandr Voevodin ()", "Armen Dzhigarkhanyan ()", "Mikhail Yezepov ()", "Nikolay Zasukhin ()", "Lyudmila Kasatkina ()", "Uldis Lieldid\u017es ()", "Aleksandr Pashutin ()", "Evgeniy Teterin ()", "Nikolay Trofimov ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
