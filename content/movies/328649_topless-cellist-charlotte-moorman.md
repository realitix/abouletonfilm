This portrait traces Moorman's career as an avant-garde performer, from her classical training to her notorious arrest as the \"Topless Cellist\" and subsequent talk-show celebrity. Rare documentations of Moorman's performances include Otto Piene's Sky Kiss and Jim McWilliams' Chocolate Cello. Interviews with Moorman's friends, family and collaborators, such as Yoko Ono, Christo and Jeanne Claude, Otto Piene, and Barbara Moore, among others, provide intimate recollections of the inimitable Moorman.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wpCFcib5ECGwxxpYucvDUduYy7Q.jpg", "actors": ["Charlie Morrow ()", "Yoko Ono ()", "Christo ()", "Jeanne-Claude ()", "Nam June Paik ()", "Barbara Wise ()", "Jerald Odover ()", "Otto Piene ()", "Beate Gordon ()", "Charlotte Moorman ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
