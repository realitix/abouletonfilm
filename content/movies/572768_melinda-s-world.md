Her dour parents, members of a religious sect, forbid the celebration of birthdays or holidays. Melinda finds solace in small things: a spun silver spider web, her box of treasures, and a stolen afternoon at Silver Lake on her \"day of days.\" As the movie and the year progresses, Melinda experiences ageless comforts and pains. A disgraced famous writer and a waylaid college professor, two exiles in the small Mid-Western town, haunt the edges of her sheltered life. An earthy, warmhearted waitress introduces her to the blues and a fizzy drink called Cola-Cola. She receives her first explorative attention from a boy. Escalating tragedy shatters Melinda's innocence. Devastated, she flees into the night where, by drawing on her tenacious spirit, she ultimately triumphs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4gyMLPgfiEepuCnpNs5YjMiUlnU.jpg", "actors": ["Jenifer Rose Olivares (Melinda McCormack)", "Zac Efron (Stuart Wasser)", "Thomas Michael Kappler (Meredith McCormack)", "Jennifer McCluskey (Alice Wasser)", "Christina Raines (Amelia McCormack)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
