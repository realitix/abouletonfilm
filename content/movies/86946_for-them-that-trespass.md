This leads him to begin wandering about the seamiest side of town where he witnesses a murder. When an innocent man is arrested, the writer refuses to assist him as the knowledge that he has been \"slumming\" could destroy his career. The young man is sentenced to 15 years in prison.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zzL5QPymL15R5FnDfx7wq847l0v.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Todd (Herbert Edward Logan)", "Patricia Plunkett (Rosie)", "Stephen Murray (Christopher Drew)", "Michael Laurence (Jim Heal)", "Vida Hope (Olive Mockson)", "Rosalyn Boulter (Frankie Ketchen)", "James Hayter (John Craigie 'Jocko' Glenn)", "Harry Fowler (Dave, Rosie's friend)", "George Hayes (The Mad Artist)", "Michael Brennan (Det.
