Returning to Flanders, he began a career that combined Renaissance technique with a new boldness of approach towards color and brushwork. His mastery at depicting surface texture can be seen in his religious images commissioned by the Catholic church. But Rubens was undoubtedly a man of the world, a charming individual who worked as a diplomat and whose connections resulted in a great number of portrait commissions. It is these portraits that are, perhaps, the most enduring achievements of a giant of art history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zJixx8LVlX2joM3N737QVQgn90L.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
