Belford (Belford Press)  Images harvested in Miles MCKANE's garden, with Mahine ROUHI, when we visited Nantes (for a projection of our film \"Tahousse\") in May 2007. Memories of a few happy and sun-filled moments in this little garden, both wild and well-ordered, where the beauty of the art of life leaves an ephemeral imprint on the fragile ribbon of a small mini-DV camera. An amateur video, a holiday movie; complicity and friendship. This moment of magic concludes with a clumsily framed shot of a large red tree in the Jardin des Plantes in Nantes, shot just before taking the train to Grenoble.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2GoxQyWxasrB0QfK708Prjptoxb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
