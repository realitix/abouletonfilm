It is a moment in contemporary history told from the experiences of the defeated opposing political group. A fundamental piece of the history of Mexico that usually does not reach the public, for it is not written by the victorious; it\u2019s akin to being invited backstage at an unimaginable performance. This story lacks scandal or corruption. It shows how politics takes place in the highest levels in Mexico and shows the human side of a popular leader.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jiiy07mr7Fv2bvB8pFzHTRTsN2A.jpg", "actors": ["Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas Sol\u00f3rzano (Himself)", "Epigmenio Ibarra (Himself)", "Vicente Fox (Himself)", "Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
