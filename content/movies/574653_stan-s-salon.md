I saw some very incredible images that night and got to meet the grand master himself. I was so inspired by what I saw and the people that I met that the moment that I returned home to Seattle I made this film. My first fully hand painted motion picture, and the techniques that I used in this film are the beginning of an entirely new faze of my filmmaking and I hope to master this technique some day.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1yIH6pmB4dOSeTbjkhKVeubEm3J.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
