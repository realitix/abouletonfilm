The house he selects may be pleasant and homelike, but most of all it is owned by a widow, and managed by her daughter. The widow and the widower are impressed with each other at first sight and a romance is imminent. However, the widower realizes his hair is both white and scant and feels that unless he looks a little younger, his chances with the widow are slim. He writes to a hair tonic manufacturer for aid. While trying to keep the letter hidden from the widow, she becomes suspicious and imagines it is from another woman, so she turns about to make him jealous. Eventually a unique trick of fate smooths out all their misunderstandings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lK5lMXgrabmvFBgtlPNq6MEg5p0.jpg", "actors": ["W.
