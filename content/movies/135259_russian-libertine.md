A hope for more righteous Russia has awakened, but the journey is a long one, and the weight of history exceptionally heavy. However, an idea for new Russia has been born, and continues to grow even at this very moment.  One of the people fighting for change is a Russian author and dissident Victor Erofeyev. He loves his country and wants it to be more tolerant and open-minded. For decades now, he has been criticising the people in charge of Russia. He has also been in trouble with the state since the Soviet times, but does not let the fear hold him back. With his work he wants to encourage the Russians to take a critical look around and try to actively improve their own situation. Now this is finally happening.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rYrDK5b58mE8yT10ro2fblk5xk.jpg", "actors": ["Viktor Erofeyev (Himself)", "Vladimir Sorokin (Himself)", "Andrei Erofeyev (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "NgYZrX5naso"}
