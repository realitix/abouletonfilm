And he kept his promise. Never ending yearning for knowledge, research practice, creative endeavor, discoveries that have unfixed all established notions - that's what was the characteristic of the great physicist. Nikola Tesla would always remain a scientist whose life was a sort of mystification rather than pure reality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mAWvs3Kb9W30ohnruFcvLCcRG5B.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
