Mixtape", "slug_title": "video-nasty-blasty-mixtape", "date": "", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "In 1983, the British government issued the \u201cVideo Nasty\u201d list -- a group of horror and exploitation movies that were banned from home video. Taboo movies like THE EVIL DEAD and THE HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY were elevated to near urban-legend status, inspiring a generation of British filmmakers to pick up a camera . . . and go nuts. VIDEO NASTY BLASTY! is a splatter-ific mixtape that celebrates this era of DIY anarchy in the UK. Kids who murder for Satan! Donald Pleasance wearing Ray-Bans! Homoerotic demon-slashers! Featuring digest versions of our favorite homegrown British nasties and ultra-rare trailers, VIDEO NASTY BLASTY! is your ticket to demented discovery. (Joseph A.
