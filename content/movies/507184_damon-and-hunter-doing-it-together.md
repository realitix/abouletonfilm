{"tmdb_id": 507184, "title": "Damon and Hunter: Doing It Together", "original_title": "Damon and Hunter: Doing It Together", "slug_title": "damon-and-hunter-doing-it-together", "date": "2006-10-21", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "Comstock Films has created a unique film series that explores sexual relationships among couples. Each film focuses on one couple and begins with an intimate interview that sets up the background of the couple's relationship: how they met, the basis of their intimacy, what attracts them sexually to one another, and how they share their innermost desires and fantasies. The camera then turns to an intimate lovemaking session, recording in detail the passion and eroticism that exists between the two. Coverage is explicit, but not provocative; it allows viewers to share in the couple's healthy, passionate, romantic relationship and to experience first hand the erotic intimacy of their lovemaking. Damon and Hunter: Doing it Together features the first gay relationship in the series. Damon and Hunter are two adult film stars on the rise, but are also real-life lovers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wEMneEcANerW9xSIXgtJ8D9P7oi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
