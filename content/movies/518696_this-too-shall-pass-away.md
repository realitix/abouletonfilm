The digital sprites flutter throughout each other's daily lives and dramas in a manner that evokes a cross between The Legend of Zelda and MTV's The Real World. At night the characters escape into digital dreams that eventually collide, via partying, into a surrealistic, psychedelic episode blurring the line between reality and oblivion.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
