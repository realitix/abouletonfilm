These include, for example, scenes from Lubbock and Clovis, the 'motorcycle' film taken by JI's brother, and some cine film shot on tour in England in early 1958 by Norman Petty. There is also a very brief clip of the Angelic Gospel Singers whose stunning version of I'll Be Alright inspired Buddy's True Love Ways. And a lot more.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
