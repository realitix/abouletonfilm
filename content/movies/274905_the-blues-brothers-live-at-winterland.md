With the help of Belushi and Akroyd's rapidly growing fame and an extremely receptive audience, this may be the most exciting performance they ever did. Although it is obvious that they take this music seriously, Belushi and Akroyd's innate comedic abilities at engaging an audience, balance their sincere reverence for the music with a boatload of fun.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lXvrFp9jgsifYdpbZfZvtM2dV3p.jpg", "actors": ["John Belushi (Joliet Jake Blues)", "Dan Aykroyd (Elwood Blues)", "Steve Cropper ()", "Matt Murphy ()", "Donald \"Duck\" Dunn ()", "Tom Malone ()", "Lou Marini ()", "Alan Rubin ()", "Paul Shaffer ()", "Murphy Dunne ()", "Willie Hall ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
