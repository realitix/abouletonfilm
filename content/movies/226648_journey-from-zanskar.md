In nearby Tibet and Ladakh, in Sikkim, Bhutan, and Nepal, traditional Tibetan Buddhist culture is either dead already or dying. The horror of Chinese government design in Tibet is being matched by the destruction of global economics elsewhere. Zanskar, ringed by high Himalayan mountains in northwest India, one of the most remote places on the planet, has been safe until now. But that\u2019s changing.  As economic growth descends on Zanskar it will bring with it an end to this unbroken Buddhist social tradition. Will the native language, culture, and religious practice be able to survive?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/OPsFkcNYLzc6ak3gqFtWe09loh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
