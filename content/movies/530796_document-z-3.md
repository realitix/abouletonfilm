It was one of three Miranda films directed by Guarini that helped re-establish her in Italian cinema following her return from a largely unsuccessful spell in Hollywood. Many critics were not impressed with the film, feeling that Miranda had not recovered the spontaneity of her pre-Hollywood films. This is considered the first movie in which Federico Fellini has worked as a screenwriter.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Isa Miranda (Sandra Morini)", "Claudio Gora (Paolo Sullich)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
