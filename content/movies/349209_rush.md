Sang-jin, who also has feelings for Baram, must work seven days a week in order to support his sole family member, Sang-hee. Sang-jin's dream is to escape from poverty and drive a sports car by the seaside with a college girlfriend in the passenger seat. He finds solace meeting Baram at the top of the building where they both work. Sun-woo is a top -flight graduate of a first-class university. He believes the best thing in life is power.
