Is there a scientific legacy - a before and after L\u00e9vi-Strauss - in anthropology?  This documentary retraces the intellectual path of the author of \"Tristes tropiques\" (\"A World on the Wane\") and \"La Pens\u00e9e sauvage\" (\"The Savage Mind\"), Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss. The anthropologist and founder of structural anthropology in France is portrayed via numerous selected extracts of interviews he has given since the 1960s. The film is a fascinating introduction into the mind of a man who is interested in all men. L\u00e9vi-Strauss has great confidence (in spite of a pessimistic view of our contemporary world) in the creative capacities of the human mind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3WGBUlHqed3Wu1yNw5e6fqEGzIC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
