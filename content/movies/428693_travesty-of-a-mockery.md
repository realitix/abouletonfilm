This domestic drama is enacted simultaneously on two separate projected screens\u2014the man\u2019s space is described by a chair standing against a blank wall, the woman\u2019s by a fridge and a fragment of kitchen sideboard. Each participant is isolated within his and her own screen, the borders from one to the other being crossed by thrown objects such as a glass of milk or a frying pan and, occasionally, by one of the participants, who, unable to contain their rage, launches an attack across the divide. A soundtrack of tuning into a series of different radio stations accompanies the film, seeming to articulate the switching emotional tenor of the scenario as it moves through confusion, anger, sadness and resignation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z1nuPMzkDzPsIcliyhCEGH65EI1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
