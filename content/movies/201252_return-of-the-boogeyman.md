Just like a kid afraid of the dark, the Boogeyman has made her afraid to close her eyes. Annie soon realizes her hideous dreams are predictions. If she can harness this terrifying power, perhaps she can prevent the bloody slaughter she forsees, and track down the Boogeyman before his body count climbs any higher. Their actions are very brave, but are Annie and her friends the hunters... or the hunted?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bsCjGvDWjm3ky1GH2OMOW3xDCj8.jpg", "actors": ["Kelly Galindo (Annie)", "Omar Kaczmarczyk (Dr. Ricky Love)", "Jeff Kizer ()", "Phillip Meister ()", "Norman Miller ()", "Jack Grant ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
