Hayden plays \"Lucky\", the same character he'd previously essayed in the Hopalong Cassidy films. This time around, Lucky tries to prove that crooked land baron Dawson (Paul Sutton) doesn't have prior claim on the entire territory. When legal methods prove only moderately effective, Lucky and his chums use more direct methods to drive Dawson and his ilk out of town.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8RJ1CRVL0N8M2FdQMQJ1V4OGJeh.jpg", "actors": ["Russell Hayden (Lucky Harlan)", "Dub Taylor (Cannonball)", "Bob Wills (Sheriff Bob Halliday)", "Alma Carroll (Delores Alvarez)", "Paul Sutton (Bart Dawson)", "Jack Ingram (Henchman Dirk)", "Edmund Cobb (Henchman Ringo)", "Art Mix (Henchman Shorty)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
