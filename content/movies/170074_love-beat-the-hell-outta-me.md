Each one is going through or has recently experienced a painful breakup. Wesley seems to have worked through his, even though it took him close to suicide. Glenn turns inward; he's depressed and sometimes weepy. Chris seems mad at the world. Sammy looks low-key and self-contained. They know too much about each other, so as the dominoes clack and the liquor flows, the hostility they've been expressing about women gets turned toward each other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cqVCEMofHPP8hzyqi7Uc1H4LOfs.jpg", "actors": ["Glenn Plummer ()", "Terrence Howard ()", "Clyde Jones ()", "Charles R.
