To celebrate their success, Bolan and T-Rex played two sold-out performances at London's Wembley Empire Pool, captured on film by none other than former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr and released as the now-legendary concert film BORN TO BOOGIE. The only existant recording of a full T-Rex concert, BORN TO BOOGIE is centered around the dual live performances (with Ringo and Elton John guest starring on two tracks) and interspersed with an acoustic set filmed at John Lennon's mansion, goofy backstage footage of Bolan, and surreal sequences of nuns and dwarves inserted for visual effect. While the original film ran for roughly one hour, this reissue of BORN TO BOOGIE restores many of the hours-worth of material shot by Ringo.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/719LkMpU2710cPUZfOtcesFHwYc.jpg", "actors": ["Marc Bolan (Self (Archive Footage))", "Elton John (Self)", "Ringo Starr (Self)", "Gloria Jones ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
