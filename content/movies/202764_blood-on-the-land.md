The plot concerns struggles between peasants and the wealthy estate-owners over division of land in the early part of the 20th century. This battle is contrasted with the rivalry of two brothers over a woman's affections. The performances are somewhat lacking, but Georgiades' assured direction and presentation of a little-known chapter of Greek history resulted in an Oscar nomination as \"Best Foreign Film.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d8hbiOkfBCU22b1rqlNQgx6RO2c.jpg", "actors": ["Nikos Kourkoulos (Odysseas Hormovas)", "Mairi Hronopoulou (Eirini)", "Giannis Voglis (Rigas Hormovas)", "Faidon Georgitsis (Yangos)", "Notis Peryalis (Marinos Antypas)", "Angelos Antonopoulos (Kotsos)", "Manos Katrakis (Father Hormovas)", "Vasos Andronidis (Priest Dimitris)", "Kostas Baladimas (Priest)", "Kostas Gennatas (Father Hormovas' janitor)", "Nikos Kouros (Shoemaker Thymios Pazis)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [288526, 163791, 367159, 198890], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
