Film director Niko von Glasow brings together a company of performers to conceive and perform a new stage comedy. In the play, a group of physically and mentally disabled hopefuls show up to audition for a TV talent show. They are sent to a separate and suitable room, where they are forgotten. Believe it or not, this up-close and often upsetting documentary is full of laughter, fun and moments of genuine theatrical magic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nHEW4FqAYqs1FL9t2VIXmVlCpNt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
