In an attempt to combat the pervasive misconception of the \u201chumorless, angry feminist,\u201d the vignettes in A Comedy in Six Unnatural Acts experiment with self-aware yet playful depictions of common stereotypes, such as the \u201cStompin\u2019 Dyke\u201d or the butch-femme couple.  In the process, Oxenberg\u2019s short film reclaims those insults and assumptions as newfound, loaded weapons\u2014to deploy on her own terms, of course.
