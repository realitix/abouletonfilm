The boy was sent to the institution for children in an attempt to socialize him and got the Muslim name \u2013 Haris. Contrary to most predictions, he was developing and making friends quickly. When the war in BiH broke out in 1992, Haris got the letter from local Bosnian authorities which asked for his immediate return. Upon returning to BiH, he had nowhere to go. While wandering aimlessly, he came across a group of soldiers that gave him a gun and took him with them", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/o4OKxcUQ8CtcYvR6Q7TPylP6apD.jpg", "actors": ["Denis Muri\u0107 (Haris)", "Pavle \u010cemeriki\u0107 (Zika)", "Isidora Jankovi\u0107 (Alisa)", "Milo\u0161 Timotijevi\u0107 (Vaspita\u010d Ilke)", "Zinaida Dedakin (Kuvarica)", "Miodrag 'Mi\u0161a' Jeli\u0107 (Makro)", "Mihailo Lapto\u0161evi\u0107 ()", "Bora Neni\u0107 (Obu\u0107ar)", "Marija Opsenica (Ilketova majka)", "Branka \u0160eli\u0107 (Doktorka)", "Tihomir Stani\u0107 (Vaspita\u010d Rade)", "Goran \u0160u\u0161ljik (\u017dikin otac)", "Ljuba Todorovi\u0107 (Direktor doma)", "Borka Tomovi\u0107 (U\u010diteljica)", "Draginja Voganjac (\u017dena u op\u0161tini)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [105523, 275096, 58014], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
