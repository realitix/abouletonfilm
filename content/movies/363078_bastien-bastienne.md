Her widowed sister-in-law Suzanne (Anna Prucnal) lives with her, and after awhile it becomes apparent that Catherine loathes her as well. The children in the house are all boys -- Catherine has two sons, twelve and thirteen, and Suzanne also has a twelve-year old. While the relationship between Suzanne and Catherine is coming to a head, Catherine is having an affair with an army officer, and the boys in the family are planning a musical performance for everyone. The crescendo may be barely audible at the beginning, but it builds up to a tragedy at the end.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/piDo8YotrL4iscf8f0TsCgtvqrG.jpg", "actors": ["Juliet Berto (Catherine)", "Anna Prucnal (Suzanne)", "Orane Demazis (Georgette)", "B\u00e9atrice Bruno (Marie)", "Serge Dambrine (Yves / Bastien)", "Mathieu Lacaille (Jean Charles / Colas)", "Emmanuel Prat (Eric / Bastienne)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
