The film was shot in two adjacent rooms. Outside views are seen in reflection via an aluminum photographic lamp, while some of the imagery is generated from photographs taken in the same spaces. The occasional voice over explores the relationship between places and dreams and that between memories and the physical events that can trigger them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q9bV6etsMl131hsfYBzBMuLt5vu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
