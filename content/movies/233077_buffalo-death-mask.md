A personal voice documenting and piercing the clich\u00e9d spectrum of Living With AIDS from carnal abjection to incandescent spirituality, no surviving moving image visionary surpasses him. Buffalo Death Mask is a three-part meditation \u2014 visual, oral and haptic, both campy and ecstatic \u2014 on survival, mourning, memory, love and community. A conversation between Hoolboom and visual artist Stephen Andrews, both long time survivors of the retrovirus, floats over what seems to be a dream of Toronto and some of its ghosts. No one savours the intimations of immortality inherent in recycled footage like Mike, no one else understands how processed Super 8 can answer the question \u201cWhy are we still here when so many are gone?\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q7QkNxsBzxrKUSd8mbBh3XAA1nS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
