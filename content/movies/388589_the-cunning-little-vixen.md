The Forester enters and lies down against a tree for a nap. A curious Vixen Cub inquisitively chases a frog right into the lap of the surprised forester who forcibly takes the vixen home as a pet. Time passes and we see the Vixen, now grown up into a young adult tied up in the forester's yard with the conservative old dachshund. Fed up with life in confinement, the vixen chews through her rope and runs off to freedom.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bgaUAEfIzHGO351NxfdmXCCRsOO.jpg", "actors": ["Elena Tsallagova (The Vixen)", "Jukka Rasilainen (The Forester)", "Michele Lagrange (His Wife / The Owl)", "Hannah Esther Minutillo (The Fox)", "David Kuebler (The Schoolmaster)", "Roland Bracht (The Parson)", "Paul Gay (Harasta)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
