The title derives from a title in the footage: THESE DRIVING DEMONS START YOUNG, and proceeds to show soap box derby races. I made a soap box racer and drove it in the official derby when I was about nine years old. The footage goes on to show various race cars, races, collisions, road cars racing and strange mobile contraptions, including rocket cars and exploding motorcycles. And of course mad drivers. All in the 1920s.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7clYZUxRz7BBTShIjMmqGdZwDVO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
