The documentary captures the spirit of the times and shows a country is divided into all sorts of clubs and subcultures. It is a country that, despite all its blessings, lives in fear and moral confusion. But what exactly are we afraid of? A kaleidoscope of scenes confronts the viewer, disconcertingly and sometimes touchingly, with this and other questions and moral issues.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ybKRXnNReG0eP0jjQwI5DXbDnzK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "s1bXymKA8eQ"}
