A group of young hippies go camping accompanied by an uptight, sexually repressed, middle-aged chaperone. The chaperone is envious of the youngster's liberated ways and doesn't trust one of the young men. Then the group is plagued by a series of vicious knife murders. Directed by Israeli-born Jourdan Alexander (as \"Jaacov Jaavoci\") and written by Svetlana, both of whom would make a name for themselves in hardcore porn, this one's nearly impossible to track down nowadays. The only known home video release occurred in Australia on the King of Video / Video Budget label and their release is reduced down to just 70 minutes from the original 87.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aoLPq6a1zy3ED7aHAfmQ4ensqQO.jpg", "actors": ["Sandy Dempsey (Marsha)", "Walter Roland Moore (Brian)", "Paula Lane (Mildred)", "John Tull (Pete)", "Sandy Carey (Debby)", "Doug Senior (Dick)", "Barbara Schillaci (Mother)", "Johnny Baron (Father)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
