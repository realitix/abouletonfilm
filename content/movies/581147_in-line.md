How peculiar that people like being an audience because they enjoy their submission to the authority of the program. This ritual of being dominated is a conspiracy with themselves that we enjoy but refuse to acknowledge. \u201cOh, no. I don\u2019t like TV because I\u2019m submissive; it\u2019s because it makes me feel good.\u201d The programs are always carefully crafted to be sensitive to people\u2019s selfprotectiveness, even if they offer a good scare, or a good cry. Well, if this is all true, what happens when, by chance, you submit to a program that refuses to be polite about your closet masochism? That tells all? \u2014Tony Conrad", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9SFIYVyN8DfK8sRlZmWBfuCv4iT.jpg", "actors": ["Tony Conrad ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
