Intimately told by veterans, their families, and those charged with their care, Halfway Home tragically affirms that the toll of war extends far beyond the battlefield. Exploring both the stigma of war-induced \"mental health issues\" and the negative attitudes towards their treatment, this moving documentary lends a human face to this controversial matter.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
