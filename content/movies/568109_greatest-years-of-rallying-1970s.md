The heroes of the age include icons like the Ford Escort, the Porsche 911, the Datsun 240Z, the Alpine A110, the Lancia Stratos, and many, many more.  This documentary covers the highlights of the decade from 1970 to 1979, the footage alone makes it worth watching, with remarkable aerial shots we\u2019ve never seen before. The simplicity of top flight rally during this period is almost enviable \u2013 with fans often lining the stages standing on the wrong side of blind corners, seemingly trusting the drivers more than they probably should have.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/phKod65FfGPUVVkJwGoiaotpm1i.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
