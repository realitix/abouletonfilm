However, His Satanic Majesty does not appear in the film. Rather, this expensively produced period piece is more along the lines of Romeo and Juliet, with young love threatened by warring families. In his first Italian film, Hollywood veteran Eduardo Cianelli goes through his usual villainous paces as the scheming father of the male lead (Jacques Francois). The most fascinating performance is rendered by Umberto Spadaro, as the village idiot, or is he? Patto col Diavolo makes the most of the visual dynamics of Italy's mountainous Calabrian region.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cPUbDsznEQ17t9fNOWY4lRMBskS.jpg", "actors": ["Annibale Betrone (Old Laroccha - Marta's father)", "Guido Celano (Il sottuficiale dei carabinieri)", "Eduardo Ciannelli (Giacomo Mola)", "Fiore Davanzati (Sarina)", "Angelo Dessy ()", "Oreste Fares ()", "Jacques Fran\u00e7ois (Andrea Mola)", "Isa Miranda (Marta Larocca)", "Ave Ninchi (Signora Mola - Giacomo's wife)", "Nico Pepe ()", "Lamberto Picasso (The priest)", "Camillo Pilotto ()", "Checco Rissone ()", "Alfredo Robert ()", "Jacques Sernas ()", "Umberto Spadaro (Scoppola - the killer)", "Luigi Tosi (Rocco)", "Saro Urz\u00ec ()", "Anne Vernon (Andrea's sister)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
