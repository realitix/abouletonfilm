He tells the story of a love-hate triangle involving Harry Witzel, an in-country station superintendent who'd seen it all, Langford, a new manager sent from England for a four-year stint, and Tondelayo, a siren of great beauty who desires silk and baubles. Witzel is gruff and seasoned, certain that Langford won't be able to cut it. Langford responds with determination and anger, attracted to Tondelayo because of her beauty, her wiles, and to get at Witzel. Manipulation, jealousy, revenge, and responsibility play out as alliances within the triangle shift.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b9EDMbOmXv6gUKuJCLBm6NIPxLH.jpg", "actors": ["Hedy Lamarr (Tondelayo)", "Walter Pidgeon (Mr. Harry Witzel)", "Frank Morgan (The Doctor)", "Richard Carlson (Mr. Langford)", "Reginald Owen (Skipper of the Congo Queen)", "Henry O'Neill (The Reverend Dr. Roberts)", "Bramwell Fletcher (Wilbur Ashley)", "Clyde Cook (Ted, First Mate of the Congo Queen)", "Leigh Whipper (Jim Fish)", "Oscar Polk (Umeela)", "Darby Jones (Darby)", "Richard Ainley (Mr. Worthing)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
