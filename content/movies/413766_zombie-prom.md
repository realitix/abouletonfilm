It is a campy, rollicking, romp through America's \"Atomic Age\" and the \"Golden Age\" of horror comic books. Here's the story...  Set in the fabulous '50s, this is the tale of a sweet teenage girl named, TOFFEE (a Gidget-type) and her \"rebel without a cause\" boyfriend, JONNY. The two meet at Enrico Fermi High School and fall in love, but the principal, MISS DELILAH STRICT (Stalin in pumps and a dress!) intervenes, persuading the indecisive young Toffee to break up with Jonny. Tortured by the betrayal, Jonny drives his motorcycle to the nearby Francis Gary Powers Nuclear Power Plant and flings himself into a nuclear cooling tower! But then he returns as a teenage nuclear zombie", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uCyVxg6agtHdzuiiuSObezC50Vr.jpg", "actors": ["RuPaul (Miss Strict)", "Darren Robertson (Jonny Warner)", "Candice Nicole (Toffee)", "David Engel (Eddie Flagrante)", "Katy Mixon (Coco)", "April Malina (Ginger)", "Katherine Von Till (Candy)", "Dominic Nolfi (Joey)", "Brendan R.
