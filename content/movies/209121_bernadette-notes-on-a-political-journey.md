Combining archive footage with a series of intimate interviews conducted with Devlin McAliskey, director Lelia Doolan perfectly encapsulates the idiosyncrasies and rebelliousness which has fuelled her subject\u2019s pivotal role at the heart of civil rights, feminism and socialism in Northern Ireland.
