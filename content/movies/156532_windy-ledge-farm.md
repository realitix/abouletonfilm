We watch an uncle mow, farm hands haying with the White Mountains in the background, various young children playing, a lad holding his cat while carrying milk cans on a yoke, a pointer stalking a cat, the annual burning of brush and rubbish, and a montage of chores and relaxation on the farm. The last shot is of spring, a flag in the background. The films are sweet and straightforward, with clear black and white images.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/51M9tuArddqguKR4n3IvNGLIlmu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
