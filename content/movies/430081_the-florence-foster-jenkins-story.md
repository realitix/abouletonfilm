Opera superstar Joyce DiDonato interprets the flamboyant \"queen of dissonance\". The involvement of the celebrated virtuoso makes it possible to contrast two different musical perspectives and gives viewers a vivid impression of the film's key conflict between inner delusion and external reality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xrpobiPfaNmXRLXCm0fYjfbQmPv.jpg", "actors": ["Joyce DiDonato (Florence Foster Jenkins)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
