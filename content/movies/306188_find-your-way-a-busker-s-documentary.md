Filmed over the course of three years, five talented artists bare all as they cope with \"making it\" in a society driven relentlessly by the allure of fame. While some dream of more, others are resigned to life on the street - and even embrace it.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
