It starts with a variation on the first image of Francis Ford Coppola's \u2018Apocalypse Now\u2019 and takes the spectator along through a strange file full of ideas and images of the city. Some images come from the North - Hollywood films and European television. The commentators are a local, traditional painter and an Afro-American video-artist from New York.
