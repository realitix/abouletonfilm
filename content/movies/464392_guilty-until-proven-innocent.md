John Pilger reports that more than half of the 500,000 people remanded in custody by magistrates each year are eventually found not guilty, fined or, as in the case of \u201cHelen\u201d, given a conditional discharge. Helen, charged with stealing a pair of slippers but with no previous convictions, recalls her day in Holloway Prison, London, which started at 7am when she joined 96 other prisoners in a rush to use four toilets whose conditions were \u201cdisgusting\u201d. Between then and lunchtime, all prisoners were locked up, with just half-an-hour\u2019s walk round a large yard for exercise. Lunch was eaten in cells, with tea at 3.30pm, before they were locked up until the following morning.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sLYqrjSsCN6rXpIP8eUuVYFApe8.jpg", "actors": ["John Pilger (Presenter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
