It's Christmas Eve, and they are waiting for Daddy Walton to come home from his job in the city some 50 miles away. Since he is late, everyone is worried and over the radio the mother and grandparents hear about an overturned bus and hurt travelers but keep this news from the rest of the family. The story is really a coming of age story about the oldest son John-Boy who must cut down the tree with his grandfather since his father isn't home and is eventually told about his missing father and sets out to find him. An all round heartwarming story, especially if you are a fan of The Waltons. A simple story about a simple family in simple times. Great family entertainment!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wcXI79DjFThXsy4YcJaTl6PVWFu.jpg", "actors": ["Patricia Neal (Olivia Walton)", "Richard Thomas (John-Boy Walton)", "Edgar Bergen (Ebenezer Walton)", "Ellen Corby (Esther Walton)", "Dorothy Stickney (Emily Baldwin)", "Josephine Hutchinson (Mamie Baldwin)", "William Windom (Charlie Snead)", "Cleavon Little (Hawthorne Dooley)", "Andrew Duggan (John Walton)", "David Huddleston (Sheriff Ep Bridges)", "Woodrow Parfrey (Ike Godsey)", "Mary Beth McDonough (Erin Walton)", "David W.
