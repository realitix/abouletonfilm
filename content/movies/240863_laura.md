She is a regular at NY nightclubs and frequents the most exclusive parties and upscale restaurants. However, she lives in a modest boarding house in Manhattan, where she shares a bathroom with other guests who are largely illegal immigrants. The film questions the meaning of success, examines the fear of returning home, the unconscious pressure of the family she abandoned in Curitiba, and the deliberate creation of a fantasy as a means of protection.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vQj0LIJ5xV6kBlHkPYFVxgk0nji.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
