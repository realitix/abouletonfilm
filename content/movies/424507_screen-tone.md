A flicker collage of these dots has then been created using a 16mm film printer. The sounds heard are those that the dots themselves produce as they pass the optical sound head of the 16mm projector. This is a camera-less and sound-recorder-less film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AtdY4PanKNb0sRVDxcbvirhkTKj.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
