Regardless of race, sexual orientation, nationality, social class, religion, or gender, all are equally shattered and all are equally victims. Those that recount their experiences show that the power / sex dynamic can come in many forms. Whether the power is taken away by physical or psychological means, and regardless of whether it is perpetrated by an individual, institution, or society, the results are equally devastating.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xSlsU66CC7R9X2UfgnZImH0Ullc.jpg", "actors": ["Page Tudyk (Robin)", "Brandon Anderson (Ronald)", "Kathy Jordan (Rachel)", "Omar Padilla (Rodrigo)", "Tamara Voss (Reese)", "Forrest Vickery (Ray)", "Troy Ford (Randy)", "Yasmine Al-Bustami (Rana)", "Mckenna Grace (Riley (Young))", "Rachael Lynee (Riley (Older))", "Dalton Smith (Ross)", "Gene Sprinkle (Richard)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "O-hi-mk66zI"}
