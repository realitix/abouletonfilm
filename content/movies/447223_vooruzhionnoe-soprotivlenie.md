In the USSR, extraordinary measures were being taken to speed up work on the atomic project, but to no avail. The reason was simple: there was no uranium in the country.  Despite the post-war devastation, already in early 1946, geological exploration parties were organized, the entire territory of the USSR was covered by uranium prospecting works. The hero of the film is a geologist on one of these expeditions. But when his friend dies, his life begins to change.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
