The Cat then introduces viewers to the homes of all the other main characters in the show. The other lessons on the DVD include doing kind things for others for no reason, and not being afraid to try new things. What a great family DVD that parents and kids will most certainly enjoy watching together. The content is squeaky clean, the lessons are fabulous and the colors, songs, music, puppetry, computerization and overall presentation are top notch! \"The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss: The Cat's Home But Not Alone\" easily earns the Dove \"Family-Approved\" Seal for family friendly viewing!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6JJjf6VI0fqAELvnsbcLRrDjXYm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
