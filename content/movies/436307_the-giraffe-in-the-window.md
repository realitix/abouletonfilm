In order to disappear as quickly as possible, they jump into the nearest car and leave, finding on the way that a little boy named Jirka, son of the car's owner, is with them. They take him to a cottage where Cih\u00e1k's eighteen-year old daughter Milena attends to him. Jirka first treats Milena with hostility, but as days pass, the \"prisoner\" and the \"guard\" become close. Milena cooks for the boy and takes care of him, but nothing can intimidate the dauntless Jirka and he seeks for the first opportunity to escape.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/opNrVGE9zh3mzKKD1XzP8HEDeFj.jpg", "actors": ["Martin Masner (Jirka Skalsk\u00fd)", "Hana Brejchov\u00e1 (Milena)", "Radoslav Brzobohat\u00fd (zlod\u011bj \u0160varc)", "Miroslav Holub (kapit\u00e1n VB Mal\u00ed\u010dek)", "Ladislav Trojan (poru\u010d\u00edk VB R\u00e1kos)", "Steva Mar\u0161\u00e1lek (zlod\u011bj \u010cih\u00e1k)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
