I realize that in becoming great at anything in one's life,\r\nother things have to suffer, and with him it seems, at least to me,\r\nthat for everything he has undoubtedly accomplished in the filmic\r\nrealm, it's created a type of 'idiot savant' (it's simply an existing\r\nterm--I certainly don't mean it pejoratively)--that is, in social\r\nskills, at least pertaining to self-marketing, or getting across one's\r\npersona in the field, he is lacking--and it negatively impacts his\r\ncinema. And that's a dirty rotten shame, because this was a fine film.\r\n\r\nHe and his excellent approach to cinema remind me of the Heisenberg\r\nprinciple and make me: a) wish Lee could find more happiness in his\r\nlife, so that he can come across better, and thus have his personality\r\nnot negatively influence cinephiles like me; and b) wonder, like in 'A\r\nBeautiful Mind', if he was happier and more pleasant, if it would\r\nnegatively impact his filmmaking? Philosophical questions such as this tend to keep me up at night, unless I have some red wine, milk or chamomile tea to wear me out and soothe me.\r\n\r\n'Clockers' worked for me. Keitel was really on a roll when he worked in this, with 'Bad Lieutenant', 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Smoke' all around this time. It was certainly a great vintage for him, and a fine time to sample his acting."}, {"pseudo": "Badlands1", "content": "This is a criminally underrated gem, a urban movie about drug dealers that feels nothin like your typical gangsta movie, it doesn't have constant rap playing the whole way through, but a poignant classical soundtrack from Blanchard, Albeit still great 90's hip hop in it. The emotion and color of the sets are tangible. I wouldn't really call this a Spike Lee joint, because Scorsese produced it, it has a much more professional and serious feel than Spikes previous corny work. The 90's Brooklyn hip hop street reality feel is there but this film hits a much deeper note in the soul, skip the mainstream trailer, it might be the reason this failed in the mainstream, when it sours with true underground heads."}], "recommandations_id": [41823, 10279, 9558, 34152]}
