One of the few such films was Screaming Ninja, aka Wang Yu, King of Boxing.  The story is set in China in the early 1900x.  Essentially playing an extension of himself, action-star Wang-Yu spends much of the time defending himself against evil martial-arts masters.  He also tries to make sense of a tragic incident in his past.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rvk73yc57FgP8TWtaHGwiDQYYMG.jpg", "actors": ["Jimmy Wang Yu (Ma Tai Yung)", "Liu Ping (Korean Hero (Black Hat))", "Shan Mao (Japanese with daggers)", "Cheng Fu-Hung (Sumo wrestler)", "Lung Fei (Ying Wu)", "Ko Hsiao Pao (Sumo wrestler)", "Ma Chi (Noble Senior Samurai)", "Chi Laan (Ying Chu's sister)", "Hong Hoi (noble young samurai)", "Wong Fei-Lung (falls from cliff w. riksha)", "Chen Chin-Hai (Japanese thug)", "Yeh Fei-Yang (Japanese thug)", "Wong Hoi (Japanese thug)", "Kwan Hung (Japanese thug)", "Wang Tai-Lang (Japanese thug)", "Hau Pak-Wai (Japanese thug)", "Chow Jun (Japanese thug)", "Li Tsui (Noodle maker)", "Siu Man-Hung (Japanese thug)", "Han Lin (Kendo fighter)", "Liang Shang-Kuan (Sumo referee)", "Chang I-Fei (Sumo wrestler)", "Yang Kuei Yu (Sumo wrestler)", "Wei Chao-Rui (Pick Pocket girl)", "Wu Tong-Chiao (Judo fighter)", "Lui Ming (Ma's father)", "Hung Chin-Lien (Ma's sister)", "Ku Chun (Chinese wanderer with flute)", "Pin Lo (Japanese thug)", "Huang Fei-Long (Japanese thug)", "Tsai Hung (Japanese thug)", "Kang Kai (Kendo master's son)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "lMB8vb1WyME"}
