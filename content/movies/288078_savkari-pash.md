Taking its cue from the realist tradition, the film counterposes an idyllic rural life (destroyed but the greedy money-lender who uses forged papers to steal the peasant's land) with the harsh city life. The shot of a hut accompanied by a howling dog are regarded as one of the most memorable moments of Indian cinema to date.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Rajaram Vankudre Shantaram ()", "Zunzharrao Pawar ()", "Kamaladevi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
