They developed their bikes through rigorous field-testing, often risking life and limb to do so. Some of these cyclists were Category-1 road racers looking for a new way to train during the off-season. Others were simply fun-loving hippies looking for a new way to commune with nature. Their early bikes were scavenged from dumpsters and junkyards. It was from these humble beginnings that a multi-billion dollar industry, a form of recreation for the masses, and an Olympic event, were born. These hefty steeds were affectionately known as Klunkerz.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/folsdIpbJY3uOyPVD5cZ82LnDAV.jpg", "actors": ["Gary Fisher (Himself)", "Joe Breeze (Himself)", "Tom Ritchey (Himself)", "Charlie Kelly (Himself)", "Mike Sinyard (Himself)", "Wende Cragg (Herself)", "Alan Bonds (Himself)", "Otis Guy (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "h19n-5qIp78"}
