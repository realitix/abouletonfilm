Despite appearing in countless films, they were never actually meant to be seen by the movie-going public. In fact, these women are so enigmatic that in most cases we do not even know their names.  This film is a tribute to these forgotten women.  Officially known as color-timing control strips, these anonymous female film studio workers were affectionately dubbed \"china girls\" by the industry. The images in this show were meant only for use by the processing lab to match color tones in the associated film.  Initially heavily scratched and faded, each images has been enlarged, restored and edited until these unknown and formerly unseen women resemble publicity snapshots of well-known film stars.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dUzfx6ZKOMHc8LEzbA8QT7wht6Z.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
