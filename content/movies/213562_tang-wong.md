The four boys, driven by very different reasons, end up praying before the Luang Poo idol at the spirit house near their school, promising to give the idol a Thai dance if their wishes come true. While not all believe in the powers of the sacred spirit, the boys enlist Nut, a transgender professional dancer, to teach them some moves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pelopljR6f3xWXFAF39OQv8oSda.jpg", "actors": ["Prinsadapak Jongkumchok (Fiang)", "Nutthasit Kotimanuswanich (Best)", "Siripat Kuhavichanun (Jay)", "Natarat Lakha (Nut)", "Anawat Patanawanichkul (Em)", "Sompob Sittiajarn (Yong)", "Chonnikan Netjui (May)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "jzqa2wY4myQ"}
