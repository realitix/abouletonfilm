(they were relocated in 1970 and became the Milwaukee Brewers) To be honest, I'd never heard of them until recently when I started reading Pilots pitcher Jim Bouton's landmark book _Ball Four_, which chronicles his almost full year with the Pilots in diary form. It's quite funny and was controversial at the time, as it basically tarnished the reputation of the game and the players. I later found out about this documentary and it's great to see quite a few of the players interviewed, including Bouton, who gives extra insights into the year. Also featured are Seattle sports journalists, team announcers, collectors, Pilots historians and even the ball boy.\r\n\r\nThere really is a loyal following that continues to this day, and thankfully, the movie is available for viewing on YouTube, so if you have any interest in baseball at all, please do yourself a favor and watch this...then come back here and rate/review it! ;)"}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "EyhBXex0sdw"}
