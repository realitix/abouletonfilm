In fact the movie has one of the most sudden ends I've seen in recent times, it literally just stops in a scene and you're left wondering what the point of it all was. That said the \"ride\" there despite of it's slow pace and lack of substance wasn't boring but it's nothing I'd watch again."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
