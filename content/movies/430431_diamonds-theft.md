A ballet dancer steals a brooch and gives it as a present to another dancer. This is a crime of passion. A mysterious black ball is after the heroine. She runs away from it and manages to give the brooch in an exquisite pirouette movement, as shiny as diamond facets. What gives a stone its dazzling luster are its polished facets. But the real gem is love, and it's much harder to get than any diamond in the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jqyRa8Twd6dRTv21ae1q9XkMjIh.jpg", "actors": ["Renata Litvinova (Woman with a Big Nose)", "Vyacheslav Manucharov (Jewelry Salesman 2)", "Dmitriy Mulyar (Jewelry Salesman 1)", "Mariya Slastenkova (Jewelry Store Customer)", "Diana Vishneva (Ballerina Theif)", "Diana Vishneva (Ballerina Thief)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
