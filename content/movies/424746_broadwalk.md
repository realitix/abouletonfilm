The camera was positioned on a busy pathway in Regent's Park, and recorded three frames a minute. The shutter was held open for the twenty-second duration between exposures, so that on projection, individual frames merge together making the patterned flows of human movement clearly perceptible. The time-lapse original was then expanded by various processes of re-filming to reveal the frame-by-frame structure of the original. \u2013 William Raban", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qw5vCHTXEmDEMdPKWqXn2Ln3BAB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
