Endless tiny bubbles floating up and up in the glass. An indulgence. A celebration. A seduction. A triumph. This is the essence of Champagne, isn\u2019t it?  But it\u2019s not just bubbles in a glass that makes the wine, or the mystique. Only sparkling wine produced within the boundaries of the Champagne region is truly \u201cChampagne.\u201d At first glance, the region is not an obvious source of romance. Champagne\u2019s history is grim and bloody, swept by war and destruction from Attila the Hun to the filthy trenches of WWI and the Nazi depredations of WWII. The environment for winemaking is desperately hard \u2014 northerly latitude, chalky soil, copious rain, frost, rot. Yet it\u2019s these difficulties that help make the wine unique.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tMK7nD2fEpVLXc6geZ1JTJ3YqTs.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [130410, 347264], "youtube_key": "zhJ6lC2Tr3k"}
