You see, Carla is afraid her little house of joy is going to be taken over by buddie Howie Mann... and that's where I fit in. As long as I'm watching over the place, Howie'll have a tough time pulling any funny stuff. Of course, my relationship with the girls is supposed to be \"purely professional,\" but things don't always work out the way you plan 'em - if you catch my drift. So, if you're looking for some hearty laughs, a little action, and a lot of hot sex, look no further than my hottest adventure ever - BEYOND DESIRE. You won't be disappointed...", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4TRbwfTWwHmwNjsGq4ZcUoc1P3W.jpg", "actors": ["D.J.
