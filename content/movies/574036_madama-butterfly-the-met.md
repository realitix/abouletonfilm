In this telecast from the Live from Met series, acclaimed American soprano Catherine Malfitano rises to the challenges, traversing a wide emotional range and delivering a vocal performance that is as dramatic as it is beautiful. Tenor Richard Leech is Lt. Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton, the callous American sailor who takes advantage of Cio-Cio-San\u2019s trusting naivet\u00e9, with baritone Dwayne Croft as the stern yet compassionate U.S. consul Sharpless. Daniele Gatti takes the podium to conduct Giancarlo Del Monaco\u2019s production, with its picturesque depiction of turn-of-the-century Japan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pRvXyYu9xBUvahl7Yuxp7QN13aT.jpg", "actors": ["Catherine Malfitano ()", "Wendy White ()", "Dwayne Croft ()", "Richard Leech ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
