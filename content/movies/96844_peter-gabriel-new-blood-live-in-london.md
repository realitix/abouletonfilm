The repertoire mixes cover versions from his Scratch My Back album with classic tracks from across his solo career in brand new orchestral arrangements. Gabriel is a renowned live performer and his onstage charisma and instantly recognizable voice combine brilliantly with the orchestral sound palette to breathe a new sense of wonder into familiar songs. As you would expect the concert is also a visual feast, with graphics, animation and imagery blending to enhance and illustrate the music. This is truly a live experience not to be missed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dmzTw74TzxdPhwfkJSQKFxt1Lpz.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Gabriel (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
