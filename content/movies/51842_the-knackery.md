All is not as it seems on the country's most watched family game-show... Reality television has taken things to the extreme and given the public, The Knackery, a show where six contestants fight for the grand prize of 'one million pounds'. To liven things up, the producers of the show release a horde of genetically modified zombies which puts a little bit more pressure on the fighters, in this Big Brother style beat-em-up. As an undercover reporter tries to scoop the story he's been waiting for, he soon comes across a kid who has entered the arena unaware of the consequences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lV3Xqqo92ck3G9XvDaC181EVXbF.jpg", "actors": ["Iain Boden ()", "Andrew Brown ()", "George Clarke ()", "Alan Crawford ()", "Graeme Livingstone ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
