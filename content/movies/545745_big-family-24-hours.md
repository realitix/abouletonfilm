The first family consists of two parents and nine children living in Nara Prefecture. The mom struggles each day to makes ends meet and put food on the table on a limited budget, and her stresses are multiplied when the family learns that they must vacate the home they\u2019ve been living in for more than 20 years. Will they be able to find an affordable home that can fit 11 people?  The second family consists of a Japanese father and American mother and their four children who recently moved to a small village in Niigata. The village population has been declining as young people move to the city for jobs. This family is doing the opposite; the father quit his job in the city to try his hand at farming. The family lives in a run-down 50-year-old farmhouse badly in need of repair and comes to rely on the kindness of older residents eager to welcome the young family to their village.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
