In taking up the well-known subject of the siren, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k wrote a bewitching score that plunges the spectator into a mysterious and disturbing universe, magnificently represented in Robert Carsen\u2019s production. Reality and the supernatural, earth and water, humans and ethereal beings are juxtaposed in this almost sublimely dreamlike opera. However, the meeting between two worlds is never without consequences: if the dreamworld nymph Rusalka sacrifices her voice, the only too human Prince loses his life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nX1JmBfKJsZdYyBSa5hlIO6ciSV.jpg", "actors": ["Camilla Nylund (Rusalka)", "Klaus Florian Vogt (The prince)", "Thomas Johannes Mayer (Vodn\u00edk)", "Karita Mattila (The foreign princess)", "Michelle DeYoung (Je\u017eibaba)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "YHeWvaIE43Q"}
