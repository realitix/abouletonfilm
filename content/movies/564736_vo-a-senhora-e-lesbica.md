In one of the traditional lunches at the house of his grandmother Clarissa, his cousin Joaquim unleashes the question that gives title to the film. The question shocks not only Clarissa, but also Joan, who, to avoid facing the question and its repercussions, detaches herself from that moment and begins to revisit her childhood memories in that house. A figure stands out among these memories: that of his aunt Carolina, a great friend of his grandmother, who was always around. Little by little, Joan understood that the constant presence of Carolina was not just by chance, and did not mean to her grandmother Clarissa just a friendship. This walk through the past awakens Joana to the possibility of sharing more with her grandmother than she had imagined.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fuoDfKTJXPPsKaLqNKEQPYVcvCR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
