The two teams are inseparable after eighty minutes. Deep into extra time, there are just two minutes left on the clock.  England rumble to within 40 yards of the posts. The ball is sent spiralling back to Jonny Wilkinson, the golden boy of English rugby, in a split second he drop kicks for goal and a chance for sporting immortality.  It is an astonishing story of pressure, expectation and courage, tracing the roots of success back to the professionalization of the game in the 90s and culminating in that glorious World Cup campaign of 2003 that turned Woodward\u2019s poisoned chalice into a golden cup.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zWKqQGKOxuGZ49kAA6VnN8BppkF.jpg", "actors": ["Jonny Wilkinson ()", "Martin Johnson ()", "Clive Woodward ()", "Matt Dawson ()", "George Gregan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "IHw95Oi51NQ"}
