At the house, they stumbled upon an illegal weapons trade that ultimately went bad. To evade the police from interrogations, the two innocent witnesses wiped away their fingerprints and left a note that stated that the crimes were committed by \"The Black Rose,\" who is known to be a fictional hero in a 1965 movie. However, a recovered fingerprint caused Kuen to be the prime suspect, and the apprentices of the Black Rose, apparently a real hero whose legacy was portrayed in the 1965 movie, attempt to seek the truth in the matter by confronting Butterfly.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sIOCg0c92cUdNASp3MpOdP365M0.jpg", "actors": ["Maggie Shiu ()", "Teresa Mo ()", "Tony Leung Ka-Fai ()", "Wong Wan-Si ()", "Petrina Fung Bo-Bo ()", "Lawrence Ah Mon ()", "Chan Fai-Hung ()", "Teddy Yip Wing-Cho ()", "Lam Lap-San ()", "Suen Ming-Chui ()", "Calvin Poon ()", "Thomas Lam ()", "Crystal Kwok ()", "Cheung Ying-Tsoi ()", "Guy Lai Ying-Chau ()", "Chan Yuen-Kai ()", "Cheung Kwok-Leung ()", "\tYip Chun ()", "Lam Sing-Ming ()", "Yue Ming ()", "Pak Man-Biu ()", "Sze-Ma Wah-Lung ()", "Tang Tai-Wo ()", "Lam Kwok-Git ()", "Fong Ping ()", "Ng Kwok-Kin ()", "Alex Yip Choi-Naam ()", "Lui Siu-Ming ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
