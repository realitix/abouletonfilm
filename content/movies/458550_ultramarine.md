The \u2018painting\u2019 that stood leaning against the window had very faint colors and regular scratches that could not be seen very well because of the light streaming in from the outside. The light changed with the time of day, and the surface of the painting also shifted. The paint on the front of the panel can only be perceived as \u2018color\u2019 by reflecting light. The fact that if the light changes what is seen also changes is quite obvious, but because it is a \u2018painting\u2019 viewers find this hard to accept.\u201d - Yo Ota", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
