Country star Dwight Yoakam makes his leading role debut as Kidder, a \"painted hero\" who's at his best - and safest - when he's taunting the meanest bulls in the business. It's only when the paint comes off that the real danger strikes on a wild Waco weekend filled with thrills, spills and more twists than an eight second bull ride.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rHQWTwvG9RcIPdCoNvHnW1ClGwC.jpg", "actors": ["Dwight Yoakam (Virgil Kidder)", "Michelle Joyner (Katelin)", "Kiersten Warren (Teresa)", "Cindy Pickett (Sadie)", "John Getz (Sheriff Acuff)", "Bo Hopkins (Brownie)", "Walton Goggins (Roddy)", "James Terry McIlvain ()", "Peter Fonda (Ray the Cook)", "Brent Anderson (Clay)", "Toby Metcalf (Luke)", "Bill Thurman (Old Man Bolen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
