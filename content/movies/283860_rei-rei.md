She comes down to Earth from her home in outer space to help solve the relationship problems of people. Her first assignment involves foiling a perfect murder and a bit of gender-bending as she tries to help Tanaka revive the life of his dream lover and get revenge on the killer, which was her ex-girlfriend. The second assignment involves pulling a sexually frustrated teenager's spirit out of a video game after the stress of being dumped forced it outside the body.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6DCnCkfR3Q8bW2qqyLKNKQPN5aS.jpg", "actors": ["Naoko Matsui (Kaguya)", "Kenichi Ogata (Pipi (voice))", "Keaton Yamada (Narrator)", "Wataru Takagi (Tanaka)", "Misa Watanabe (Tanaka (female))", "Kumiko Nishihara (Mika)", "Shin-ichiro Miki (Satoshi)", "Katsuyo Endou (Satoshi's Mother)", "Miho Yoshida (Dr. Manami)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
