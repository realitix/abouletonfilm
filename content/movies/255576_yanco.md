His overly astute hearing drives him into the woods and away from the cacophony of the town's hustle and bustle. Once in the woods, he meets a kindly old hermit who teaches him how to play the violin he made. After the old man dies, the violin ends up at a pawn shop, and each night the boy sneaks in to play it in secret. It is this haunting, nightly music that sets the town on edge -- people think an evil spirit is on the loose.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dIYDZ1Ml8dSFyBtKALn41Zq3T8d.jpg", "actors": ["Ricardo Ancona (Juanito)", "Jes\u00fas Medina (Old Man)", "Mar\u00eda Bustamante (Maria)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
