According to Dow, this project is in some ways many years in the making, stemming from his work with his frequent collaborator Marco Williams on films like Two Towns of Jasper, a project that eventually forced him to confront his own racial identity. Intersection of I combines video, data visualization, and interactivity to explore how millennials who identify as white, or partially white, process their racial identity. This can be very uncomfortable and even controversial at times but the project is creating a fascinating and important space for white people to think and talk about race during such a charged period in American history.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
