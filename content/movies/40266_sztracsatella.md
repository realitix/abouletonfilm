For sometime, Landos, a noted conductor, has suffered anxiety and a lack of confidence about his work. The problem is made worse by his wife's successful dental practice. Eventually it becomes too overwhelming and the conductor is sent to a mental hospital for rest. There he encounters clinical psychologist Andrea Novak. At first she seems colder than alpine snow, but when he sneaks out to return to work and she finds him there, things quickly turn hot. The two become engulfed in passion that they ignore their own spouses and professions, causing Novak to be formally reprimanded. Eventually Landos finds himself forced to choose between his wife and Novak. Unfortunately, he loves them both. ~ Sandra Brennan, All Movie Guide", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9OV1ZCVZOUS0Izc97HZL3b2wS3z.jpg", "actors": ["Andr\u00e1s Kern (Karmester)", "Enik\u0151 Eszenyi (Dr. Lantos Andrea)", "Dorottya Udvaros (Ildik\u00f3)", "Reviczky G\u00e1bor (Nov\u00e1k doktor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
