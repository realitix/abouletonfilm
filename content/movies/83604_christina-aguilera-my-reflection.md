Aguilera's first concert video, a repackaging of a slick special that aired on ABC-TV in 2000, shows what this \"girl\" really wants is to move beyond the bouncy R&amp;B-flavored pop she's known for. Her cheeky hits (\"Genie in a Bottle,\" \"Come On Over, Baby,\" \"What a Girl Wants\") are followed by songs from Mi Reflejo, her Spanish-language album, and My Kind of Christmas, her holiday release. She has sweet duets with R&amp;B legend Dr. John on \"Merry Christmas, Baby\" and balladeer Brian McKnight on \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,\" and shares the stage with rapper Lil' Bow Wow (weird, but it works) on \"So Emotional\" and \"Christmas Time.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6xZ1fsPOYeqkgO6jV1laeYysnhc.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
