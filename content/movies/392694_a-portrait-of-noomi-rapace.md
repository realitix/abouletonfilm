The film not only depicts an actual 3 dimensional portrait of Rapace being intricately sculpted, but also acts as a portrait of her in itself, by acting as a metaphor for the various chronological steps in the actor\u2019s process. Flying Lotus, the highly acclaimed forward thinking musician and producer provides an exclusive soundtrack of 6 different previously unreleased material, which was born out of conversations between him and Throup at the beginning of the project.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/alr5LrzpleEq5KNOcVZNkQuga4S.jpg", "actors": ["Noomi Rapace (Herself)", "Aitor Throup (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
