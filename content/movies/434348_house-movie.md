While the great majority of this material was staged, re-enacted, or otherwise planned in advance, it is documentary inasmuch as the \u2018actors\u2019 play themselves and participate in familiar events in a familiar setting which does not represent, but is, their actuality. Taking into consideration the film\u2019s musical form, it might be said that in terms of documentary, House Movie is an exaggeration of John Grierson\u2019s definition.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lcm0xnbsATEEHff3Rv729ETezkH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
