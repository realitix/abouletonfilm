This female grim reaper, considered a saint by followers but Satanic by the Catholic Church, is worshiped by people whose lives are filled with danger and/or violence- criminals, gang members, transvestites, sick people, drug addicts, and families living in rough neighborhoods. \"La Santa Muerte\" examines the origins of the cult and takes us on a tour of the altars, jails, and neighborhoods in Mexico where the saint's most devoted followers can be found.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ojZeq8l0NCqp7295X4VhVaWrVfo.jpg", "actors": ["Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal (Narrator)", "Jesus Padilla Alonso (Protagonist)", "Jesse Ortiz Pi\u00f1a (Protagonist)", "Enriqueta Romero Romero (Protagonist)", "Ernestina Ramirez Soto (Protagonist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ZgQftFWM41Q"}
