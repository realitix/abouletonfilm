Afree-form take on the current trend of cosmetic obsession and the immortal quality of painting, the film searches for \"what\u0092s on the inside\". Topical news stories (such as the US military offering free cosmetic surgery) and musical film sequences are created with paint-on-glass animation, found footage and documentary techniques. The music was commissioned for the film. Selected musicians, including New Zealand\u0092s Hip-Hop artist, \"Coco Solid\" and \"Half Japanese\" founder Jad Fair, wrote and recorded humorously cynical songs about the cosmetic craze. Also included is a rare appearance by the Dutch Ambassador of Cosmetic Surgery, Marijke Helwegen.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
