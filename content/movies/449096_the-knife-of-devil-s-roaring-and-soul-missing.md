There\u2019s a murderer who goes by the moniker Devil Swordsman gallivanting around the countryside in an outfit that looks like a ninja cloak by way of a KKK robe who\u2019s killing all of the major kung fu masters and clan leaders with a single swipe to the face. One of his first victims is the head of the White Dragon tribe, whose son, Shan, is played by Dorian Tan Tao-Liang. Shan naturally assumes the role of detective in order to avenge his father, since that\u2019s what people do in these movies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g0HfBYby06UJ3SIXFd1wB4tcgyb.jpg", "actors": ["Dorian Tan Tao-Liang ()", "Lo Lieh ()", "Doris Lung Chun-Erh ()", "Tung Li ()", "Au-Yeung Chung ()", "Shih Chung-Tien ()", "Chang Fang-Hsia ()", "Liu Ping ()", "Lee Ying ()", "Yun Fei ()", "Wan Chung-Shan ()", "Chi Ying ()", "Feng-Shan Fan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
