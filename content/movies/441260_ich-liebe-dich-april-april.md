While Caroline is afraid of annoying her mother Hella who ever since her divorce twenty years ago distrusts men in general, Tom dreads the criticism of his professor, a family law specialist who objects to the concept of marriage. By chance, Caroline gets hold of some juicy information: Her mother and the professor used to be a couple and she is their child. With almost missionary zeal she addresses herself to the task of convincing the two grown-ups to get back together. In the process, however, she steers both her academic studies and her own marriage into a crisis.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xXHQaIGWxrsTnJzcNaHLZf3CrXE.jpg", "actors": ["Cornelia Schmaus ()", "Jan Nowicki ()", "Amina Gusner ()", "Slawomir J\u00f3zwik ()", "Jaecki Schwarz ()", "Siegrid Reintsch ()", "Katrin Martin ()", "Gerd Michael Henneberg ()", "Gertraud Kreissig ()", "Hilmar Baumann ()", "Eva Sch\u00e4fer ()", "Ursula Werner ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
