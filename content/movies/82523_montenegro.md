Her behavior is bizarre, perhaps mad: she poisons the dog's milk and advises the dog not to drink it; she sets the sheets afire as her husband sleeps; she crawls under the dining table to sing. While detained at airport customs for carrying pruning shears, she meets a young Yugoslav woman and goes with her to a Gypsy enclave where she's fought over, takes a lover, helps with the sordid entertainment at a bar, and returns home more dangerous than before. The film also tells parallel stories of Marilyn's daughter becoming a junior homemaker as the young immigrant practices her striptease.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6SofG7GZRmafUBkleXCgoeIGyEJ.jpg", "actors": ["Susan Anspach (Marilyn Jordan)", "Erland Josephson (Martin Jordan)", "Marianna Jacobi (Cookie Jordan)", "Jamie Marsh (Jimmy Jordan)", "John Zacharias (Grandpa Bill)", "Per Oscarsson (Dr. Aram Pazardjian)", "Marina Lindahl (Secretary)", "Borivoje Todorovi\u0107 (Alex Rossignol)", "Lisbeth Zachrisson (Rita Rossignol)", "Svetozar Cvetkovi\u0107 (Montenegro)", "Patricia G\u00e9lin (Tirke)", "Dragan Ili\u0107 (Hassan)", "Nikola Jani\u0107 (Mustapha)", "Mile Petrovi\u0107 (Zanzi Bar Customer)", "John Parkinson (Piano Player)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
