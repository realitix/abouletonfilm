For a good run, Fleischer was Walt Disney Studios' biggest competitor, a worthy foe that was responsible for such characters as Koko the Clown, Betty Boop, Popeye and the \"strongest\" of them all, Superman. Through their many contributions to the genre, the Fleischers helped animation become what it is today.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
