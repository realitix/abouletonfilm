Outside life beckons when she meets Julia, the confident, spirited maintenance girl, inspiring a growing infatuation. But privately, Birdie can\u2019t turn away from her fascination with the gory and whimsical hallucinations that plague her. Birdie sets off on her spiritual quest to discover if the source of her visions is something saintly or a dark heresy. The convent itself holds ghosts of nuns who\u2019ve met untimely deaths. Are they calling Birdie to the same fate?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5S63ZzUAHV2LtNqUcNnc4KJsxp3.jpg", "actors": ["Ilirida Memedovski (Birdie)", "Suzan Crowley (Mother Superior)", "Kymberly Mellen (Sister Dolores)", "Kathryn Browning (Grandmother)", "Kitty Hall (Julia)", "Kati Brazda (Sister Clarence)", "Kathryn Haynes (Sister Prudy)", "Holly Stanfield (Sister Mercy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "zorU_bAZqvc"}
