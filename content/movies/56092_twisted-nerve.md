His mum babies the boy, a consequence of Martin's elder brother, a Down Syndrome sufferer (or 'Mongoloid' - or even 'mentally backward' as they say here), being in full-time care, and the doctors having warned Martin's parents not to have any more children - just to be on the safe side. Too late: troubled mummy's boy Martin, with his cuddly toys and penchant for smashing his own reflection, appears to have proved the doctors misgivings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nAbjJfShp7g9MGUoGbhtkMujlz5.jpg", "actors": ["Hayley Mills (Susan Harper)", "Hywel Bennett (Martin (Georgie) Durnley)", "Billie Whitelaw (Joan Harper)", "Frank Finlay (Henry Durnley)", "Barry Foster (Gerry Henderson)", "Phyllis Calvert (Enid Durnley)", "Salmaan Peerzada (Shashie Kadir)", "Christian Roberts (Philip Harvey)", "Gretchen Franklin (Clarkie)", "Thorley Walters (Sir John Forrester)", "Russell Napier (Professor Fuller)", "Timothy Bateson (Mr. Groom)", "Basil Dignam (Doctor)", "Marianne Stone (Store Detective (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [86979, 40343, 80382, 68133], "youtube_key": "KmqGOXMUmjY"}
