Another is about Erik, whose wife has been lobbying a Better Homes and Gardens type magazine to do a spread on their perfect home. When the editors finally relent, she makes Erik sip his red wine in the laundry room lest he stain their cream-colored couches. Svend, the last remaining Marxist in Copenhagen, is the impassioned organizer of a political mass meeting where no one shows up. Finally, Jens, a pizza and porno connoisseur, connives his way to some booty by convincing Gry the model that he lives with his mentally challenged brother. Over the course of a week, their paths cross and nothing, and nobody, is ever quite the same again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j0u9KFNP868Sce7cLACj3CHwkEz.jpg", "actors": ["Helle Dolleris (Inge)", "Louise Mieritz (Tina)", "Frank Hvam (Leader of the competition)", "Kirsten Lehfeldt (Lea)", "Claus Ryskj\u00e6r (Svend)", "Anne Sofie Espersen (Gry)", "Waage Sand\u00f8 (Erik)", "Dan Zahle ()", "Anne Sofie Byder ()", "Jens Andersen ()", "Pernille Grumme ()", "Jytte Kvinesdal ()", "Isidor Torkar ()", "Peter Belli ()", "Henrik No\u00e9l Olesen ()", "Bent Warburg ()", "Preben Harris ()", "Hanne Tvestmann ()", "Claus Flygare ()", "Peter Secher Schmidt ()", "Rudolf Brink ()", "Ikram Sarwar ()", "Simon Rosenbaum ()", "Kim Veisgaard ()", "Hans Henrik Clemensen ()", "Ane Vinther ()", "Morten L\u00fctzh\u00f8ft ()", "Henrik Larsen ()", "Tom Jensen ()", "Pernille Hansen ()", "Anna-Louise Dahl Lassen ()", "Tola Montana ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
