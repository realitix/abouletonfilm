Declared \u201ctoo fast to race\u201d at the end of the 1986 season, the Group B cars changed the face of rallying! The Lancia Delta S4 could accelerate from 0-100km/h in 2-3 seconds on a gravel road, and Nigel Mansell is reputed to have said that the Peugeot 205 T16 could out-accelerate his F1 car! All were built to reach at least 400bhp, so we pushed these super-charged beasts to their absolute limit to see what else they could do, with legendary ex-World Rally champion Stig Blomqvist behind the wheel!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1kvbXJXbjmP2rbNp0ZrJxLzLUqK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
