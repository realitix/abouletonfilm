During his sixty-year-plus career, Eisner introduced the now-traditional mode of comic book production; championed mature, sophisticated storytelling; was an early advocate for using the medium as a tool for education; pioneered the now-popular graphic novel, and served as inspiration for generations of artists. Without a doubt, Will Eisner was the godfather of the American comic book.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rpTj3AWOf39HNEykjtWOx9Smy90.jpg", "actors": ["Will Eisner ()", "Art Spiegelman ()", "Frank Miller ()", "Jerry Robinson ()", "Jules Feiffer ()", "Kurt Vonnegut Jr. ()", "Max Allan Collins ()", "Michael Chabon ()", "Neil Gaiman ()", "Stan Lee ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "gL9zI-WI0Go"}
