Each of Adam's actions - at first he can't stand up, then he barks like a dog, then he sleeps - requires God's intervention. After Adam discovers how small the planet is, how little there is to do, and God's unwillingness to let him leave the Earth, he is depressed, lonely and disconsolate. So God asks Adam's patience for a few minutes while He fashions a companion for Adam. Adam is delighted: he dons a bow tie, uses mouthwash, and finds a bouquet of flowers. Is God thinking what Adam is thinking?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vGjJg3PVUYOLYvzV22Kwr1edxIk.jpg", "actors": ["Nick Upton (The Hand of God)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [213735, 300927, 229104, 188264], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
