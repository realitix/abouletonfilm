Preceded by Luisa Miller (q.v.), there is more dramatic intensity and story line than in the earlier works. The plot centers around Stiffelio, a minister, who discovers that his wife, Mina, has been unfaithful.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ysqXGbjYHtm7M8XEuxC4SEFy9ce.jpg", "actors": ["Jos\u00e9 Carreras (Stiffelio)", "Catherine Malfitano (Lina)", "Gregory Yurisich (Stankar)", "Gwynne Howell (Jorg)", "Robin Leggate (Raffaele)", "Lynton Atkinson (Federico di Frengel)", "Adele Paxton (Dorotea)", "Edward Downes (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
