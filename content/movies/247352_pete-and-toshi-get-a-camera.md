Out on appeal, blacklisted, watched by the FBI, he buys an old camera. With his wife Toshi, they start filming their musician friends. After several years of making small films, they decide to take the family around-the-world to film musicians in the most remote corners of the earth. The historic 16mm footage is intercut with modern day interviews of the family as they lend insight into a time &amp; place that doesn't exist today. Part travelogue, part musical odyssey, part ethnocentric dream, \"Pete and Toshi Get a Camera\" will take you places you would never have imagined.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Pete Seeger ()", "Toshi Seeger ()", "Daniel Seeger ()", "Mika Seeger ()", "Tinya Seeger ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
