In comically absurd as well as tragic episodes describing small victories and major defeats, homesickness and class distinctions, the film offers - using home movies, photographs and current professional footage - deep insights into the filmmaker's family history. It is an attempt to illustrate the balancing act between \"up here\" (Austria) and \"down there\" (Yugoslavia/Croatia) that characterizes generations of guest workers. Directed by Djordje Cenic and Hermann Peseckas.  - Written by Djordje Cenic", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mTPxp5uykmBG8j2c2Pq0fjPoQ4b.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "6d2QiG2Ebi8"}
