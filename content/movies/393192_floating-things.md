That's Avram's big-time idea: he returns to Romania to start breeding watch dogs which he can later export to Italy. As it happens, he settles next to a camp of immigrants recently sent back from Rome. Thus, the Italian tension is willy-nilly reenacted on the banks of the Danube. Avram's life gets complicated. He starts having an affair with his own daughter in law, lands in conflict with his ex-immigrant neighbors and his life is literally under threat. The film ends with an unpredictable situation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uljUaXigLZtRPj9MqEQj42nXzZW.jpg", "actors": ["Magda Cernat (Iuliana)", "Toma Cuzin ()", "Claudiu Maier (Policeman)", "Olimpia Melinte (Magda)", "Liviu Pintileasa (Romeo)", "Valentin Popescu (Avram)", "Nicodim Ungureanu ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
