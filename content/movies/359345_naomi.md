The main character, J\u014dji, is a well-educated Japanese man who is an electrical engineer in the city, and comes from a wealthy landlord family. J\u014dji wishes to break away from his traditional Japanese culture, and becomes immersed in the strange new Westernized culture which was beginning to form in Japan. The physical representation of everything Western is embodied in a young girl named Naomi. J\u014dji sees Naomi for the first time in a caf\u00e9 and instantly falls for her exotic \"Eurasian\" looks, Western-sounding name, and sophisticated mannerisms. Like the story of the prepubescent Murasaki in the classic novel The Tale of Genji, J\u014dji decides he will raise Naomi, a fifteen-year-old caf\u00e9 hostess, to be his perfect woman: in this case he will forge her into a glamorous Western girl like Mary Pickford, a famous Canadian actress of the silent film era.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/knM4Y4slxDcFjL99ipv7etRs3Jc.jpg", "actors": ["Yumika Hayashi (Naomi)", "Yumi Yoshiyuki ()", "Hinako Akiyama ()", "Kazuhiro Sano ()", "Mineo Sugiura (Naomi's Husband (as Masato Kino))", "Kyoko Irohani (Tomoko)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
