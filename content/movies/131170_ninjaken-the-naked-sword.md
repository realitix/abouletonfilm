Despite overwhelming odds, Murasame nearly succeeds, but in the end is outnumbered and badly wounded. Fleeing the daimyo's Samurai, she collapses, awakening to find herself not dead, but hidden within a mysterious convent. However, the woman-loving abbess's promises of shelter are not all they seem, for already a sinister plot has taken control of Murasame's future. Now she must use all her skills, both as a Ninja and as a woman, to escape a deadly web of slavery and deception. But it is not just escape that Murasame must seek, but also revenge... for when you betray a Ninja, you must forfeit your life!
