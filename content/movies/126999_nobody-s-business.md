Ultimately this complex portrait is a meeting of the minds -- where the past meets the present, where generations collide and where the boundaries of family life are stretched, torn and surprisingly, at times, also healed. Berliner has transformed a story of a troubled man who has sealed himself off from life's pain into a work of universal resonance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/meEFVvwfDbcFeYDSDuLofUfnuar.jpg", "actors": ["Alan Berliner (Himself)", "Oscar Berliner (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
