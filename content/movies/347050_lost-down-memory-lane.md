Eight of them live together under constant supervision and care. They are all in the first phase of the disease: bouts of lucidity, forgetfulness and falling into oblivion constantly alternate. The patients live their lives, as long as they're capable. The film is a 'tranche de vie': a portrait of the daily coming and going of people in that particular and ditto state. It is also the portrait of a brutal disease that irreversible expropriates the memory from the characters. Eventually the characters will have changed. Because of their illness, they may have been disappeared completely, physically or mentally.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p8u6L0ouCDetwQGQTKF6284Sgx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
