It asks, among other questions, is the Amazonian woman a rare strong female image or is she a figure derived from male phantasy? The film explores the complexities of such questions, but does not seek any concrete answers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eAi9N8SlklbZDCYomruJuXLgg2H.jpg", "actors": ["Debra Dolnansky (Penthesilea)", "Michael Thomas ()", "Jan Creighton ()", "Jim Goode ()", "Lisa Kephart ()", "Pat Kerwin ()", "Whit MacLaughlin ()", "Kristine Nielsen ()", "Brian Reich ()", "Jerry Stropnicky ()", "Ann Woodworth ()", "Peter Wollen (Himself)", "Grace McKeaney (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
