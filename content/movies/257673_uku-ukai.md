Renowned Lithuanian documentarist Audrius Stonys took these words as a motto for his latest film, a meditative visual essay which portrays old people undertaking all kinds of activities, meditation and group laughter therapy. Without a single word of commentary, he creates from sophisticated, aesthetic images a compelling study of human corporeality which, in an ideal union with spiritual equilibrium, can sustain us with the pledge that old age doesn't have to be a painful wait for the last breath.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aq0tV0PamskeoSKksn8RAf5AFc9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
