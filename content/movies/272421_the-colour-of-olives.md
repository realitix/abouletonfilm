Through director Carolina Rivas' sensitive lens, we discover the private world of all eight members of the family. As their dramas unfold, we catch a glimpse of their constant struggles and the small, endearing details that sustain them, including olive trees, two small donkeys and their many friendships. Constructed with a combination of verit\u00e9 scenes and re-enactments, this poignant and richly crafted film offers its audience a much needed opportunity to reflect on the effects of racial segregation, the meaning of borders and the absurdity of war", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pBe4Z9pNFb0nG1baBq025KPLExy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
