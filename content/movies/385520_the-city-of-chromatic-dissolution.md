The Cantrills are well known for their 'colour separation' films. To create these works they shoot a scene three separate times on black and white film stock, using a different colour filter each time. In the lab, they combine these three films onto a single Eastmancolour print. This process creates dramatic transitions in colour that the Cantrills liken to the vibrancy of Technicolor.  Though the footage here was shot in the mid-\u201980s, it was only last year that they edited it into this fifteen-minute movie. Structurally it\u2019s simple enough: just a series of views of various parts of inner Melbourne, from panoramic wide shots to close-ups of the sides of buildings. The soundtrack blends and warps familiar urban noises \u2013 cars, buskers, the ringing bells of trams \u2013 into a kind of musique concr\u00e9te.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6tDN3RhGmAlEuO8Axs5IBHjymFS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
