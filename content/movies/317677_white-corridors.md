Told episodically, the story concentrates on the day-to-day activities in a busy hospital, where research pathologist Neil Marriner (James Donald) conducts experiments in the hopes of curing diseases impervious to penicillin. Marriner is aided in this endeavor by lady surgeon Dr. Sophie Dean (Googie Withers), who happens to be in love with him. After a tragedy occurs for which Marriner holds himself responsible, the film builds steadily to an exciting climax involving a untested -- and potentially dangerous -- serum. The top-rank British supporting cast includes Barry Jones, Moira Lister, Petula Clark, Basil Radford, Dagmar (later Dana) Wynter, Bernard Lee, and, in a minor role, future \"Dr. Who\" Patrick Troughton.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fYi782IKpqAE50WvWr6El7ClNLg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
