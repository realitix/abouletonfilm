But how can you escape your own mind? The concept of UTOPIA is inspired by Bj\u00f8rn Alexander Brem's life and nightmares - the combination of being a lawyer in daytime and GOTHMINISTER at night drives him eventually insane - it becomes impossible for him to separate reality from imagination. The other GOTHMINISTER members Chris Dead (drummer), Icarus (guitars) and Turbo Natas (guitars) also take part in this nightmarish world filled with undead walkers, witches, werewolves and monsters.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rkVmx6VH7Br8gQkOojp4k1Q6tBx.jpg", "actors": ["Fie Baro (Zombie, Dead bride)", "Unni Bendigtsen (The little girl)", "Geir Bratland (Geir Bratland)", "Bj\u00f8rn Alexander Brem (Gothminister)", "Linda Cecilie Stoea Buckholm (Lady Zombie)", "Alena Chechyk (Nurse)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "rAx5iUQOOKk"}
