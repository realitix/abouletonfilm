One night in bed, Tomas (Tomas Arana), a magician, begins telling a story to his wife Desire (Marit Nissen) about Emma (Iaia Forte) and Sal (Tommaso Ragno), a married couple whose love life has gone stale. In order to fire up their relationship, Emma and Sal begin playing an increasingly elaborate series of role-playing games, in which they assume different personas -- Sal saves Emma as she is tied to railroad tracks, or Emma must seduce another man to pull her husband out of debt. But the question soon arises -- are Emma and Sal real? And who really holds the power in their lives? Chimera also features Franco Nero as one of the participants in Emma and Sal's sexual fantasies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8E7MP8TpBhFzSLeLhKKFZ3NR05H.jpg", "actors": ["Iaia Forte ()", "Tommaso Ragno ()", "Tomas Arana ()", "Marit Nissen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
