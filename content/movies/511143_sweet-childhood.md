Based on a real-life recording, Sweet Childhood is a playful animated short with two narrators\u2014namely, the Zvianes of past and present. Guided by her own voice from 30 years ago, the celebrated author of Les deuxi\u00e8mes employs a range of techniques to evoke the na\u00efve charm of children\u2019s drawings, giving graphic form to her quirky, youthful narrative. The result is a hilarious short that questions just how \u201csweet\u201d childhood really is.
