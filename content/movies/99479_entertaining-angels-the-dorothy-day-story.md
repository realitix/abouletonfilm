However it is meant, this film captures much of the real-life drama that took place on big city streets, and of the very personal trials which eventually led her to convert to roman Catholicism, and a dedication to helping the poor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qlnRf2EW1kU8XFHhfVRDAqybrvD.jpg", "actors": ["Moira Kelly (Dorothy Day)", "Martin Sheen (Peter Maurin)", "Lenny Von Dohlen (Forster Batterham)", "Melinda Dillon (Sister Aloysius)", "Paul Lieber (Mike Gold)", "Heather Graham (Maggie Bowen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "vblgJ-8eY9o"}
