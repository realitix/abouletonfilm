Thousands of survivors comprised 10 percent of this Chicago suburb, including Jack, the father of co-producer, Eli Adler. The relationship between father and son deepens as they return to Poland, where Eli learns more about the extended family that perished during the Shoah. Together they retrace the painful and debilitating journey through two ghettos and two concentration camps. Included are poignant commentaries and archival footage of the historical events spanning 70 years and two continents.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mELcLZ5cqyk4hpE36jOiq3aZf6o.jpg", "actors": ["Eli Adler\u001d\u001d\u001d\u001d\u001d\u001d\u001d\u001d ()", "Jack Adler ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
