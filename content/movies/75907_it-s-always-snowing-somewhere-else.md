A celebration of friends, their adventures, and the spirit of East Coast Snowboarding. No sponsors, no heli-shots, no HD dollys or crazy special effects. Just a group of homies out of New York who love to shred, and snowboarding captured in its most raw form. Even if the snow is old, brown and crusty.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oZ91ID1MyXXfgptLqO5vyRJZwvg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "lhu3WsIINbU"}
