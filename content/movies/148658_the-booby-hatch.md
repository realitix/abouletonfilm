One of her friends at work, Marcello Fettucini (Rudy Ricci), is at risk of losing his job because he\u2019s having trouble getting an erection. If he can\u2019t get aroused, he can\u2019t test out the new products! Can Marcello and Cherry work out their problems and live happy, or will they continue to just \u201clay down on the job\u201d?
