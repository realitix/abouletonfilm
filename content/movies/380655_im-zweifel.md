But when a classmate of her son dies in a car accident, that's unusual. Judith begins to doubt: herself, her job - but also her family. For all at once everything seems to indicate that her own husband and son were involved in the accident and now want to cover this up. The emotionally intense drama of award-winning director Aelrun Goette raises fundamental themes without giving easy answers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e6XKb0ncy2nQ5M3AfaYatYOEbFj.jpg", "actors": ["Claudia Michelsen (Judith Ehrmann)", "Henning Baum (Christoph Ehrmann)", "Thomas Thieme (Theo Schwarzberg)", "Wilfried Hochholdinger (H\u00e4rtling)", "Thomas Loibl (Kommissar Markus Minow)", "Hendrik Arnst (Herr Daschidek)", "Matthias Bundschuh (Bestatter)", "Jordan Elliot Dwyer (Paul Ehrmann)", "Paula Kn\u00fcpling (Leonie M\u00fcller)", "Valerie Koch (Mutter M\u00fcller)", "J\u00f6rg Pose (Vater Sch\u00fctz)", "Hildegard Schroedter (Frau Westphal)", "Andreas Schr\u00f6ders (Vater M\u00fcller)", "Theo Trebs (Sailinger)", "Nina Vorbrodt (Mutter Sch\u00fctz)", "Katrin Wichmann (Pfarrerin Ines)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
