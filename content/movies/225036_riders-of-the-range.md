Dusty's good-hearted but weak-willed brother Harry, adding to his $3000 gambling debt to Willis, reluctantly agrees to pay it off by allowing the Ringo Kid, Burrows' vicious hired gun, to rustle cattle from his sister's ranch. Kansas intervenes, deters the rustlers and persuades Harry to confess his involvement to Dusty. Kansas, sent into town by Dusty to pay off Harry's debts, suddenly finds himself on the wrong side of the law, wrongly accused of murder and must rely on Dusty's belief in his innocence for his salvation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uDe1hgaKFkCJgL4tdxgSWk1vBi0.jpg", "actors": ["Tim Holt (Kansas Jones)", "Richard Martin (Chito Rafferty)", "Jacqueline White (Priscilla 'Dusty' Willis)", "Reed Hadley (Clint Burrows)", "Robert Barrat (Sheriff Cole)", "Robert Clarke (Harry Willis)", "Tom Tyler (The Ringo Kid)", "William Tannen (Trump Dixon)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
