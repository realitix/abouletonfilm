I knew next to nothing about hijras before I saw this film, but I had heard that India had made a third sex an official designation. Maybe I had only seen one depicted in the film Jodhaa Akbar.\r\n\r\nI was completely absorbed with learning about the lives of the hijras and I just wish the film was longer!! Most of the film is interviews with hijras, but the really fascinating part is a glimpse at hijras doing blessings at a wedding and of a small child. They also show part of the ceremony to become a part of the hijra community, which they describe as similar to a Hindu wedding.\r\n\r\nThe film centers on two Hirjras, and their histories in joining the hijra community, which became their family. One of the hirjas still lives with and supports her mother, but is estranged from the rest of the family.\r\n\r\nI discovered that Meera Darji, the director has created a webpage for the film with lots of background history.\r\n\r\nMust read!! She alludes to it briefly in the film, and has a scene from one of the Mahabarat serials showing a hijra in Hindu mythology:\r\n\r\nwww.transindiafilm.co.uk/?page_id=16\r\n\r\nThis film is appearing in Film Festivals, and is currently available for purchase on Vimeo."}], "recommandations_id": []}
