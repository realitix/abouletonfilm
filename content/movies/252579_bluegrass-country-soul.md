This documentary does more than just capture on of the largest bluegrass festivals of that decade, it's also an interesting mixture of live performances, interviews, impromptu jam sessions and crowd footage of live music set in a small town surrounded by the now long gone red clay and tobacco shacks of North Carolina.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tVugE6eoQjHDSzEpbG97WpmBtMQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
