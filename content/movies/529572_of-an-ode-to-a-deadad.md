It was shot up in the Faroe Islands whilst looking down onto the small village of Tjornuv\u00edk.  The voice over is an ode to Andrew K\u00f6tting's dead father, which was written and recorded earlier in the morning in one of the small Faroese crofts that the camera looks down upon.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
