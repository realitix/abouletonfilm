This period drama is set during that early 19th century war and focuses on one of its heroes, Sven Tuuava. Sven is a decent yet not too brilliant soldier, and his exploits are partly balanced here by the charms of a compatriot. With plenty of action and humor throughout, this effective drama should entertain most audiences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4JkzapA57nmmTvUDBwGMVUdrOkC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
