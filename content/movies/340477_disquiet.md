After travelling by foot through a dark, woodland forest, a figure enters into a desolate, desert-like world. Its journey is intercepted by a looming structure \u2013 representing visions of society, memory and need \u2013 which is explored, but ultimately rejected, leaving the figure to continue on its quest towards an unknown destination.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d5gCgjGjVR1lOdt7u5b8Fsslt1a.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
