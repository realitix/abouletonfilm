Attempting to locate a certain person and a certain artefact for his insistent client, he finds himself sinking in aquicksand twilight world of dead Lotharios, comatose sleeping beauties, Voodoo gangsters, masked adventurers, unlikely 1930s private eyes and violent chiaroscuro women\u2026 and this is Northampton when it\u2019s still awake.
