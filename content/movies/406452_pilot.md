As hosts, AA Bronson, Felix Partz, and Jorge Zontal describe their collective transformation from young strivers to \"famous, glamorous artists,\" and the diversification of the General Idea media empire. Using a library of clips, they recount General Idea's public performances, films, and fashion designs (such as the \"Venetian Blind Gown,\" modeled here by dancers, swimmers and snow skiers). They also discuss their print publication, FILE, and their decision to change the magazine's logo after Time-Life sued them for trademark infringement in June 1974. (\"They didn't like our lifelike format,\" says Bronson.) A witty survey of the group's early work, Pilot is punctuated throughout by a voice-over manifesto on their continuing project, the Miss General Idea Pavilion of 1984.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["AA Bronson (Himself)", "Jorge Zontal (Himself)", "Felix Partz (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
