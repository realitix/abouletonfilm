A both eerie and infinitely fascinating archive that she herself has now sorted out and reassembled. Her father's transgressive voyeurism is turned against himself, while a courageous self portrait simultaneously grows out of the almost incestuously intimate 'home movies'. The result is a family expos\u00e9 that can't be shaken off that easily, and which in an intelligent and absolutely unique way raises the question about the right to not be seen - a question that has become even more relevant in the present day.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z3KslnX2swaa6plQhwHC2abFQBf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
