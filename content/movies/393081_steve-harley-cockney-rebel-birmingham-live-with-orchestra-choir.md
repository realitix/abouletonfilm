Performing \u201cThe Human Menagerie\u201d &amp; \u201cThe Psychomodo\u201d albums.  \u201cIt's been a long time coming- something like 39 years. Now we're here, at last, with an orchestra and a choir and a big rock band, to play those first two albums pretty well the way they appeared on the original vinyl.
