But Mr. August's refusal to get mixed up in a street brawl makes him look like a coward to Ms. Pickford. Meanwhile, convict Alfred Paget has escaped from prison; and, he is \"A Beast at Bay\". While Pickford and August go for a ride in her automobile, criminal Paget ambushes one of his guards, taking the man's clothing and gun. Pickford drops off August, still arguing he is a coward, and drives off. Alone, Pickford gets out of her car to retrieve a fallen garment; then, on-the-lam Paget moves in to carjack her. From a distance, August witnesses Pickford being taken at gunpoint - can he save his girl, and prove he's not a coward?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7all82KMNGsJz2XgnG5dPVWOWyP.jpg", "actors": ["Mary Pickford (The Young Woman)", "Edwin August (The Young Woman's Ideal)", "Alfred Paget (The Convict)", "Robert Harron (A Farmer)", "Mae Marsh (The Young Woman's Friend)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
