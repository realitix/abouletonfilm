A bar, a toilet, a wasteland, a garden, a trailer. The cruising body can't, unlike the flaneur, be alone. She won't leave the world outside of her. Several eyes follow her: the women holding the cameras, the director. The director is sending her a love letter. The director needs her cruising body. They are a part of each others fantasies and share a dream about a city's possibility of providing safe sexy spaces. They travel together to look for the rooms in between, to find rooms of their desires.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uAQxBVetGRfPgleJVFfB7uEb419.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
