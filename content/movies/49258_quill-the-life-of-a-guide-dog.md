When he grows to an adult dog, he is taken to a guide dog school, by a friendly, yet firm trainer Satoru Tawada. Although Quill is a little slower than the other dogs at the school, he seems to have an unusual 'empathy' and remarkable patience with his trainers. Tawada decides that Quill would be the ideal guide dog for Mitsuru Watanabe, but Wanatabe, a lonely and ill-tempered middle aged man, isn't as enthusiastic - he would \"would rather sleep than be dragged around by a dog.\". From here, the story is narrated by Wanatabe's daughter, Mitsuko, and slowly, Wantanbe is rehabilitated, venturing into the outside world, and learning, not only to trust other humans, but the animal at his side who guides him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lPF9Xd10zyCTtgleaEIBaAv6YKR.jpg", "actors": ["Kaoru Kobayashi (Mitsuru Watanabe)", "Kippei Shiina (Satoru Tawada)", "Kazu Matsuda (Etsuo Watanabe)", "Yukika Sakuratani (Mitsuko Watanabe)", "Keiko Toda (Mrs. Watanabe)", "Teruyuki Kagawa (Isamu Nii)", "Shinobu Terajima (Mitsuko Nii)", "Hiroko Natori (Ren Mito)", "Rafie (Adult Quill)", "Kenji Mizuhashi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [21997, 59807], "youtube_key": "x5aL5UtKrHg"}
