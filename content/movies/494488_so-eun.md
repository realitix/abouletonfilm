She\u2019s skinny and quite bad at basketball, but she really likes basketball. The problem is that her school doesn\u2019t have enough players for a team, and they\u2019re trying to dismiss the basketball team. So-eun doesn\u2019t have anybody to share her frustration. Then one day, Yu-jin, a washed up movie actress, and Yong-sik, Yu-jin\u2019s fan who also goes to the same school as So-eun, appear in So-eun\u2019s life. Now, So-eun\u2019s time starts to run quite differently from before.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5Xp0v2y44MbkQjMbNuzKiVKQwn2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
