A predator who stalks streets at night looking for blood, she has lived over a century; tormented by memory, living in a run-down motel by the sea, Irina has reached the end. Her perceptions skewed, her body and mind revolting against themselves, she waits for an exit. Her private hell is echoed by the motel manager, driven by an obsession to protect Irina and keep her secrets safe, and a broken prostitute whose desperate plight may be worse than Irina's. It's the tale of three people living a life on the fringe, trapped in world of literal and figurative decay.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bj47cAm1HYthmEakcfOi2wU0G8K.jpg", "actors": ["Shauna Henry (Irina)", "Carrie Gemmell ()", "David Goodfellow ()", "Andre Becker ()", "Mark Goodfellow ()", "Jason Tannis ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
