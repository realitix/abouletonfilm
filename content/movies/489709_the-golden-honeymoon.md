Numerous 16mm films were sent to Sears, but only one film was preserved; however, as it was not complete, it could not be used. In 2003, the Munich cin\u00e9math\u00e8que museum restored the film, which  narrates a Ring Lardner short story. The missing parts were filled in from a radio play recorded in 1946.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rUZS4Sf68hkRpJ4k8DKQyC7tS9o.jpg", "actors": ["Orson Welles ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
