He is a russian Don Juan except that he himself doesn't seek to seduce; the women around him simply find him irresistibly attractive, and he is only too happy to go along. The play predates the realism of Chekhov's later works in its desjointedness, but many of its scenes show the seeds of brilliance that would eventually emerge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d4LBGUsgt9oiNlo21xm4diTMm5W.jpg", "actors": ["Rex Harrison ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
