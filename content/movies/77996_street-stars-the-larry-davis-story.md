No one was immune from Davis' savvy manipulation -- not the corrupt cops or the violent crack dealers. But keeping up such a stressful lifestyle isn't easy, and just as Davis was preparing to go straight it all fell apart. When the police forced their way into Davis' sister's apartment, the elusive criminal fled out the window. In the seventeen days that followed, Davis led authorities on a 17-day manhunt that would only end when Davis surrendered to the F.B.I. In guerilla-style, this documentary, filmmaker explores the remarkable flight of Larry Davis and the events that ultimately unfolded when he was finally apprehended by authorities and placed on trial.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
