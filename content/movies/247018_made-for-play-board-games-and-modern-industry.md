This documentary shows how a board game makes the leap from an idea to your table.  You'll see every aspect of the manufacturing process: the technology and machines, the many detailed steps, and the hundreds of people that are involved in the production of a single game.  Mostly, we hope the film gives you a greater appreciation of the time, effort and investment that goes into every quality board game that makes it to the marketplace and your home. The business of fun requires a lot of hard work!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xfV7uDB1HbAH9Ype5TYaWQmy4u2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
