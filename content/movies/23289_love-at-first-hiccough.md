She insists that she wants her first time to be with a guy, who knows what it's about. Her rich (and arrogant, pretentious and obnoxious) boyfriend Peter serves the purpose, and he's more than willing. In fact, he's pushing forward as much as he can, but Victor, a freshman who has a serious crush on Anja, has other plans. Her first time should definitely not be with this buffoon, and he's ready to take it VERY far!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wXTqJUvWeZbNamE5izjrYiXLCXY.jpg", "actors": ["Sofie Lassen-Kahlke (Anja)", "Robert Hansen (Viktor)", "Karen-Lise Mynster (Bente)", "Karl Bille (Torkild)", "Mira Wanting (Gitte)", "Sebastian Jessen (Brian)", "Thomas Bo Larsen (Historiel\u00e6rer)", "Anne-Grethe Bjarup Riis (Ekspedient i Dyreforretning)", "Helle Fagralid (Lotte)", "Rasmus Albeck (Esben)", "Jonas G\u00fclstorff (Nikolaj)", "Joachim Knop (Peter)", "Claus Bue (Kristian - Viktors far)", "Inge Sofie Skovbo (Jette, Anjas mor)", "Kristian Halken (Willy, Anjas far)", "Preben Harris (K\u00f8bmand)", "Lasse Lunderskov (Onkel Finn)", "Sonja Oppenhagen (Tante Elisabeth)", "Aksel Rasmussen (B\u00e5dudlejer)", "Gerda Gilboe (Dame)", "Maj Lervad Grasten ()", "Emily Yatman ()", "Lasse Baunkilde ()", "Per Damgaard Hansen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [23291, 54666, 15965, 23294], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
