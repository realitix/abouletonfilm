Cheated out of their pride. After loosing their horses during the night, Los Banditos set out on foot to seek revenge on their mortal enemy, \u201cThe Law\u201d, and save their enslaved companero, Paco. What follows is a spectacular visual feast of epic cinematography in which the six fight incredible odds to remain friends.  LAS NUEVE VIDAS DE PACO is the first in a trilogy encompassing the classic struggle of good vs evil (or evil vs good), with an ending that will twist your guts up. The old west extravaganza represents yet another stepping-stone in the soon to be legacy of film-making from GSF.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zAUSJZGHcnFbRXMBZIPVW1MZgo2.jpg", "actors": ["Ben Sanchez ()", "Chico Brenes ()", "Daniel Castillo ()", "Gabriel Rodriguez ()", "Keenan Milton ()", "Mike York ()", "Paulo Diaz ()", "Richard Mulder ()", "Shamil Randle ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
