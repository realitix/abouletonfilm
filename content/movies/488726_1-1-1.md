Photographed a frame at a time over three days, 1+1+1 shows us the wordless tale of unlikely lovers, the first appearing as a hovering devil in flight, excreting a vegetable life, while her's clock-spitting, bathing-besuited figure lifts weights in a frank measure of indifference. Their touch promotes a shimmering aura of light, a celestial forcefield which they lash against, finally retiring to the kitchen with a clutch of tools to fine tune desire. Could I fix you? Donning each other's clothes, they fly off together to the strains of Strauss's Blue Danube Waltz.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k9ByspcB7EXZ0Vw3XUETFpWH0Fh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
