As a favor to Richard's uncle, the warden has given the filmmakers and their crew unprecedented access to all of the prison including death row where we learn that an inmate will be put to death in seven days. At this point, Execution moves forward to the present day where we meet Mimi who is trying to sell the film that Richard and Daniel are in the process of editing. The prison footage, we find out, was confiscated by the warden ten years earlier and has just now been returned to the filmmakers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2LqTPWvT50C1XFOksbx048q8Wfq.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
