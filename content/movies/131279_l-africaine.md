Seventeen years on, they are more statuesque than sexy, but both give larger-than-life performances that contain moments of completely thrilling vocalism. The casting is very strong, with the exception of Justino Diaz's Nelusko, which has strong presence but not much vocal allure. As Inez, Vasco da Gama's fiancee and rival for Shirley Verrett, Ruth Ann Swneson sings with great beauty and has impressive stage presence, very much holding her own in the confrontation with Verrett in the last act. Domingo is refulgent of tone and dramatically convincing, and he and Verrett strike sparks. She really comes into her own in one of the most preposterous mad-scenes in all opera, where she is slowly poisoned by the scent of a giant tree, contriving to make this dramatically truthful and even moving.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m0smwkWzHzI6usPdWxSlzwRk1qV.jpg", "actors": ["Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (Vasco Da Gama)", "Shirley Verrett (S\u00e9lika)", "Ruth Ann Swenson (In\u00e8s)", "Justino D\u00edaz (N\u00e9lusko)", "Patricia Spence (Anna)", "Kevin Anderson (Don Alvaro)", "Michael Devlin (Don Pedro)", "Philip Skinner (Don Diego)", "Mark Delavan (High Priest of Brahma)", "Joseph Rouleau (Grand Inquisitor of Lisbon)", "Sigmund Seigel (A priest)", "Maurizio Arena (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
