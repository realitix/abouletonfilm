Much of the original has been re-worked: the 'found footage' has been re-shot, slowed down, tinted, and re-edited with a sound track of minimalist composition. As a result, the exotica of colonial travel and sport take on new and sinister meanings. The acts of violence, especially those of hunting, recur in patterns that suggest visually that war is a logical development. A close examination of the work, starting with the opening sequence of a railway journey, explores the centrality of questions of memory and history to this remarkable and influential film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zU8dr92BOnuYd4T0zwQnoS2xACU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
