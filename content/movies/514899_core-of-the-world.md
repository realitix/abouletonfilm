Surrounded by foxes, deer, badgers, and dogs, he lives in a small building next to the house of the facility\u2019s owner. He treats the dogs, cleans the kennels, oversees the workers, and meets with clients and their dogs. It\u2019s easier for him to get along with dogs than with people. Egor is willing to take on any job to get closer to the facility\u2019s owner and his near and dear. He wants the impossible \u2014 to become a member of that family.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eYl883iqYF3mn7kRebq72PhPFzb.jpg", "actors": ["Stepan Devonin (Egor)", "Dmitriy Podnozov (Nikolai)", "Yana Sekste ()", "Viktor Ovodkov (Ivan)", "Yevgeni Syty (Vladimir)", "Ekaterina Vasilyeva ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [527248], "youtube_key": "0_NvujVqKMI"}
