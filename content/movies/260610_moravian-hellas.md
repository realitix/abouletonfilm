The Str\u00e1\u017enice folk festival, backed by the cultural Party apparatus of the time, for years had little to commend itself to authentic folklore. In the film the event assumes the form of a bizarre stage spectacle with almost surrealistic elements that Vachek reinforces with unconventional approaches (commentary appearing as titles on screen, singing, declamations into the camera, feature etudes, the fusion of news coverage and fiction). The result is a stirring film collage depicting various characters, from crowd-pleasers, Easter egg decorators, kitsch artists and peddlers, to museologists and local residents, all of whom come up against the eccentric \"identical\u201d twin reporters Karel and Jan Saudek and a bored actress who appears as an extra. Using their special blend of irony and wit, they present us with the sad truth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k2G1P9p2aHdZEypJ9lcLeK2YJ7D.jpg", "actors": ["K\u00e1ja Saudek (Twin A)", "Jan Saudek (Twin B)", "Alena Karpilov\u00e1 ()", "Jozka Sever\u00edn ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
