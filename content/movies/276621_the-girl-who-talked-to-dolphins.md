It was carried out by visionary 1960s neuroscientist John Lilly, who had a remarkable ambition; to communicate with dolphins by teaching them to speak English. The experiment was seized upon by NASA, who were embarking on the first serious search for extra-terrestrial intelligence beyond the Earth. When they detected a signal from ET, they would need to understand how to communicate with a species other than humans. Here, without leaving the planet, was the opportunity to practice such inter-species communication. But what started with \u201860s idealism would spiral into the darkness of the decade, and end in tragedy, with rumours and scandal about drug abuse and a sexual relationship between Peter and Margaret. Fifty years on, this film tells the real story of just what happened at the Dolphin House.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wAg0V10xVLZj4swnpF0VXovhja5.jpg", "actors": ["Jeff Bridges (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
