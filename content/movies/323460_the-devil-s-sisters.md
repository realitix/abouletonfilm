When her policeman boyfriend Antonio dumps her for spurning his more physical advances, virginal Teresa decides to go to Tijuana and look for a job. She answers a newspaper ad seeking an attractive young woman to help with \"extensive domestic and social activities\" and soon finds herself locked in a bedroom cell and forced to service the paying customers of hostess Rita Alvarado. Teresa seeks solace in alcohol and cigarettes until Antonio turns up as a paying customer, calls her a \"money-hungry whore\" and refuses to help her.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2yh1jS8mtCj0Z79Qc4WZ8IqcxsK.jpg", "actors": ["Sharon Saxon (Teresa)", "Fred Pinero (Antonio Sanchez)", "Velia Martinez (Carmen Alvarado)", "Anita Crystal (Rita Alvarado)", "Ramiro G\u00f3mez Kemp (Robert Fernandez)", "William Marcos (Jos\u00e9 Rodriguez)", "Beryl Taylor (Mrs. Hernandez)", "Mildred Rodesky (Marta)", "Babette Sherrill (Ester)", "Toni Camel (Dolores)", "Joan Jacobs (Victoria)", "Nora Alonzo (Emilia)", "Tammy Simms (First Girl)", "Michael DeBeausset (Englishman)", "Mark Harris (Henchman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
