There he is teamed with a seemingly rough old sailor/trapper, Randb\u00e6k, and a scientist, Holm. Trapped in a tiny hut together as the Arctic winter sets in, a complex and intense love/hate relationship develops between Randb\u00e6k and Larsen, who are more similar than either would like to admit.
