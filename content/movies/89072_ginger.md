To break the case, they recruit Ginger, a young woman from an upper-class family to act as bait for the kidnappers and hopefully lead the police to their hideout. It may sound like a foolproof plan to the police, but Ginger's the one who has to risk it all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kEM47O1m7THN4ya9klIpHIqubiH.jpg", "actors": ["Cheri Caffaro (Ginger)", "Duane Tucker (Rex Halsey)", "Herbert Kerr (Jimmy / Jimbo)", "Casey Donovan (Rodney)", "David Ross (J.D.)", "Michele Norris (Vicki Jennings)", "Cindy Barnett (Jean Oliver)", "Lise Mauer (Elizabeth Anderson / Liz (as Lise D.
