In the story of the adulteress Jesus confronts the Pharisees with the simple phrase, \u201clet him without sin cast the first stone,\u201d and thereby teaches us of God\u2019s immense mercy and grace. Caiaphas, who unrighteously judges a blind man sinful, is contrasted against the gratitude of the blind man when Jesus freely heals him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rqhbNYwjhAmQD0ykfotXFvvY5kT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
