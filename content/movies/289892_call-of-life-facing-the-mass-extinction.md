If current trends continue, scientists warn that half or more of all plant and animal species on Earth will become extinct within the next few decades. Call of Life investigates the scope, the causes, and the predicted effects of this unprecedented loss of life, but also looks deeper, at the ways in which both culture and psychology have helped to create and perpetuate the situation. The film not only tells the story of a crisis in nature, but also in human nature, a crisis more complex and threatening than anything human beings have ever faced before.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ui3PQLAbXxexVKGJXkL4SVYuO3o.jpg", "actors": ["Steven Beissinger (Himself)", "Sally Bingham (Herself)", "Ignacio Chapela (Himself)", "Peter Coyote (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
