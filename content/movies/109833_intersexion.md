Expatriate Kiwi sexologist Dr John Money of the world renowned Johns Hopkins Medical School believed that gender was the product of \u201cnurture not nature.\u201d His studies into intersex people led to a particular surgical treatment model for babies born with ambiguous genitalia \u2013 the idea being that doctors could produce healthy and happy men and women by intervening early in an intersex child\u2019s life. Usually that meant a family secret that had to be kept at all costs.  But as the film shows, human sexual development is never that straight forward. This is a heart-warming story told with a mix of laughter and tears in the most frank and revealing way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uVQwa7QDfQQecPhjHJgkiyPr048.jpg", "actors": ["Mani Bruce Mitchell (Mani Bruce Mitchell)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
