Sara is an art critic whose obsessions exceed even his. When she lands a writing gig at a major art magazine, the pair retreats to a cabin in the woods, where Max reveals his strange new painting method. Convinced of its potential, she agrees to collaborate on a piece sure to revolutionize the art world. While both original and mesmerizing, the project reveals something dark and disturbing about their relationship. Like two digital-age Frankensteins, they manage to make a painting come alive - though the unsettling consequences of their success may be more fit for the pages of a blood-soaked tabloid than the chronicles of art history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xIZj5OBC2Aq5mDNBLAFi3ApPlHr.jpg", "actors": ["Jesse Woodrow (Maximilien Klinkau)", "Tamzin Brown (Sara Speed)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
