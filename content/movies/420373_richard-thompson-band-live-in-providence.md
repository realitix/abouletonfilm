The only flaw with the DVD is it's too short--many of Thompson's shows can go well over the two hour mark and I suspect that many songs are missing from this terrific show.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7xIWo7nEzuH1f996YmAiDl1cwUn.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Thompson (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
