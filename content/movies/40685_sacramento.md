On route he incurs the wrath of bully boy Britt Dawson, who doesn't take kindly to his Bostonian manners, however Dawson's girl Lacey Miller does, and along with newly acquired friend Kegs McKeever, Tom has the foundation to see his plans thru to fruition, but Dawson and his loose cannon younger brother are determined to get in the way.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those films that the John Wayne haters should seek out when they use the argument that he always played the same characters. Here he is far from macho, for sure he will be forced to branch out and defend what's right, but his Tom Craig here is gentile and full of grace, very much a gentleman thank you very much. Plot wise we are treated to standard fare, good guys and bad guys just don't get on, and you just know that some pretty dames are going to have a say in proceedings. Yet this piece really has much more going for it, it's sense of fun, courtesy mainly of Edgar Kennedy and Patsy Kelly's blossoming relationship, the advancement of drugs to cure the sick and it's back drop of the Sacremento gold rush, all of it comes together to totally satisfy come the final credits. 7.5/10"}], "recommandations_id": [137458, 68082, 169828, 145966]}
