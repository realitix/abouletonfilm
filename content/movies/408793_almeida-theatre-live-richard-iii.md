War-torn England is reeling after years of bitter conflict. King Edward is ailing, and as political unrest begins to stir once more, Edward\u2019s brother Richard \u2013 vicious in war, despised in peacetime \u2013 awaits the opportunity to seize his brother\u2019s crown.  Through the malevolent Richard, Shakespeare examines the all-consuming nature of the desire for power amid a society riddled by conflict.
