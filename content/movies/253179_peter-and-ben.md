Self-sufficient and alone, Peter was content. Then he met Ben. Peter found Ben, an orphaned newborn lamb, abandoned in a ditch. Now Ben has matured into a full-grown wooly sheep with ambitions to move into Peter's house with him. Peter, however, has other ideas. Peter and Ben is a touching and quirky story of how two \"black-sheep\" form an unusual and enduring bond.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cEs76CpX6fPd351AkO6GGKFrpiD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
