Dan has just recovered from a scorching New York Times review, which forced his last show out of theaters prematurely. Now he faces a wider backlash against puppetry, suggesting an eerie parallel between himself and his new puppet-subject - a portrait photographer whose stunning body of work was very nearly lost forever.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vwwsXhktVz0PdPavPdzYWnUdl4k.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
