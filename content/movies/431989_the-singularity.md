How will these technologies change what it means to be human? Director Doug Wolens speaks with leading futurists, computer scientists, artificial intelligence experts, and philosophers who turn over the question like a Rubik\u2019s Cube. Ultimately, if we become more machine-like, and machines more like us, will we sacrifice our humanity to gain something greater? Or will we engineer our own demise? THE SINGULARITY is a comprehensive and insightful documentary film that examines technology\u2019s accelerating rate, and deftly addresses the resulting moral questions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zGLNrSusjvDJsLaicq1TknLwP4p.jpg", "actors": ["Ray Kurzweil (Himself)", "Leon Panetta (Himself)", "Richard A.
