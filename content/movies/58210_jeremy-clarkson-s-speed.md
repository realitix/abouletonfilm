Clarkson sets out to explore both what compels us to pursue these limits--often at considerable risk to our own safety--and what effect the quest has on us. The result was an immensely engaging series, a few highlights of which are collected on this video. The best moments are those that find Clarkson sticking to the brief: interviewing the aristo-twit tobbogganeers of the Cresta Run; trying to understand why he, an experienced driver, will never be as fast as Michael Schumacher or Colin McRae; a musing on the qualities needed to be a fighter pilot; an examination of the extraordinary sport of speed-skiing, in which cat-suited kamikazes hit speeds of up to 150 miles an hour.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vZbG28b4gtVVfOlEQctNgACmixy.jpg", "actors": ["Jeremy Clarkson (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
