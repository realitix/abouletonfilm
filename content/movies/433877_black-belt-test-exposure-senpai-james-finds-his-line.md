Here, saturated color frames reminiscent of the earlier exposure-works are disrupted by pure black-and-white scan lines and video feedback. It is a summary work, combining techniques from several different phases of Kirby's practice, and this allows Kirby\u2019s improv strategy to achieve a new level of freedom, with certain expected formal gestures disrupted by whole new frames of reference.
