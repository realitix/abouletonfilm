Traditional mandalas have been used in Hinduism and Buddhism for hundreds of years. Non-traditional mandalas were made popular in the West by Psychiatrist Carl Jung in the early 1900s. His ground breaking work with non-traditional mandalas led to the concept of the collective unconscious and was later used to develop the Myers-Briggs type indicators. Christian Mandalas build from Jung's work as well. Because you use vision, your most powerful sense, this approach enables the Holy Spirit to act deeply in you as you engage with scripture.
