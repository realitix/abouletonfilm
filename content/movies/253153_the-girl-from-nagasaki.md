It's a modern day tale that starts with the young Madame Butterfly emerging from the ashes of the atomic bomb in Nagasaki. By a subtle meshing of reality and fantasy, Michel Comte and his team bring to the screen a visual orgy of modern ballet, opera and narrative filmmaking.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2XspnwTMavkyJwOvnVPAFQ3bAOH.jpg", "actors": ["Mariko Miyamitsu (Madame Butterfly (as Mariko Wordell))", "Edoardo Ponti (Officer Pinkerton)", "Christopher Lee (Old Officer Pinkerton)", "Michael Wincott (Goro)", "Michael Nyqvist ()", "Paulina Semionova ()", "Sasha Alexander (Adelaide)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "p4UO4-2eKS4"}
