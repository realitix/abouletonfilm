Thus to all the ignorant readers and sports-docu directors:\r\n\r\nAN ABUSIVE UPBRINGING DOES NOT MAKE A PERSON ABUSIVE!!! \r\nThe main problem is entitlement: The abuser thinks he has a RIGHT to abuse (because the girl was cheating etc.). \r\n\r\nAND he keeps continuing believing this because he almost never has any consequences for his behavior. As Lawrence Philips here, who didn't get excluded from this sports-profession, or imprisoned the first time he was caught abusing.\r\n\r\nThis documentary only excuses the abusers, by blaming their poor upbringing for their behavior, which in turn only encourages abusers to abuse some more. This kind of ignorance is damaging to society and victims of abuse and violence.\r\n\r\nMany many people have experienced high amounts of physical and psychological abuse without being abusers themselves. \r\n\r\nEducate yourself - don't be an idiot!"}], "recommandations_id": [437217]}
