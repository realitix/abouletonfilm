Using his special ghetto-jive powers, Jerome uncovers the scheme while helping himself to the luscious offerings of the widow of one of his \"customers\" - an evil, rich bastard that has been replaced by one of the agents as part of the bacteriological war. Can the shuffling Jerome keep his hands off horny white women long enough to save his country? Probably not, but you'll laugh at this fool's attempts to balance animalistic sex and patriotism! And what is the power of the OSMOMOLIMITER?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5gGIeOCBghSvhkpHZRGDr3Uej5U.jpg", "actors": ["Christopher Michael (Jerome Jackson)", "John Harwood ()", "Derek Loughran ()", "Laurel Canyon ()", "Beverly Glen (Jennifer, the Friendly Slut)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
