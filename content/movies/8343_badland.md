But when he was later deployed to Iraq, Jerry was an older man, a father of three and embittered by broken promises and unfulfilled desires. When Jerry returns from Iraq he has been transformed by horrors that cannot be forgiven. He lives a life of poverty, his children afraid of him and his wife, Nora (Vinessa Shaw), unsympathetic and unhappy. When Jerry discovers that Nora has betrayed him, his anger and despair drive him to commit an act so heinous and irreversible that nothing he had experienced in combat could have prepared him for.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qnziSm0PIWRssFSy3y4HtFC0kg5.jpg", "actors": ["Jamie Draven (Jerry)", "Grace Fulton (Celina)", "Vinessa Shaw (Nora)", "Joe Morton (Max)", "Chandra West (Oli)", "Tom Carey (Louie)", "Pete Seadon (Sheriff Thomas Pellegrino)", "Keith White (Patrol Officer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "oQ0yfNqNMoI"}
