This is my favorite werewolf by far.  I try to watch it a couple of times a year.  Takes place in the mountains in Big Bear, Calif.  Very fast pace, no guts & gore, Werewolf makeup man did a good job.  Couple of scary moments, the cave scene and the jail scene!  Watch it if you get a chance - You just may like it!! \r\nDavid N."}], "recommandations_id": [35911, 35919, 39311, 52840]}
