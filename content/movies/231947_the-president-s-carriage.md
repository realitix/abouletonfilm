The weather was all that could be desired, and the films are, therefore, very fine photographically. There are five scenes in all, as follows: 3. President Roosevelt in his carriage, with mounted escort, passing up Market Street. A good picture of the President, and a spirited subject throughout.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
