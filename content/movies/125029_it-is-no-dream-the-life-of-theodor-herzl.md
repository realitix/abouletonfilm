Narrated by Academy Award winner, Sir Ben Kingsley and starring Academy Award winner Christoph Waltz as the voice of Theodor Herzl, the film examines how Herzl, a well known journalist and playwright, an assimilated, Budapest born Jew, horrified by the Dreyfus trial in Paris and the anti-Semitism he saw spreading across Europe, took upon himself the task of attempting to create a Jewish homeland in Palestine against all odds. Over the span of 8 years, Herzl organized and led a worldwide political movement that within 50 years led to the establishment of the state of Israel. The film follows Herzl as he meets with Kings, Prime Ministers, Ambassadors, a Sultan, a Pope and government ministers from Constantinople to St. Petersburg, from Paris to Berlin, from Vienna to Vilna in his quest to build a Jewish nation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rs42Nh4yj417LG6ozC7sacNvu1E.jpg", "actors": ["Ben Kingsley (Narrator)", "Christoph Waltz (Theodor Herzl (voice))", "Matthew Asner ()", "Athena Demos ()", "Brian McArdle ()", "Tom Metcalf ()", "Steven Schub ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
