Director Mark Lewis (Cane Toads: An Unnatural History, The Natural History of the Chicken) injects his trademark irreverence and humor into the story as he follows a trail of human conflict, bizarre culture and extraordinary close encounters.Filmed with high-resolution 3D technology, Cane Toads is the first Australian digital 3D feature film.\u00a0 Custom designed equipment allows viewers to get up close and personal with these curious creatures like never before. The unique viewing experience is like being immersed in the world of the toad.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2uVI8ildQLhCxYcHLpuMTYeMBuu.jpg", "actors": ["Neil Young (Police Constable Neil Bartlett)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [38465, 59355, 53521, 58772], "youtube_key": "gYUHnf7Uy1k"}
