It's the old saw about two sisters, one good, one bad. The nice sister (Kay Morley) tries to steer the nasty one (Joy Reece) towards the straight and narrow path, but it's no use. Only when it's too late does the erring sister learn the horrible price of fast driving, hard drinking and uninhibited sex. And it's ALL HER PARENTS' FAULT!!!! Youth Aflame was reissued in 1959 as Hoodlum Girls, during Hollywood's next J.D.-movie cycle.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iPeoJoqS2CsdYBKX4IfBkO4jrSd.jpg", "actors": ["Joy Reese (Katy White)", "Warren Burr (Frank Monahan)", "Kay Morley (Laura White)", "Michael Owen (Al Simpson)", "Rod Rogers (Lester)", "Edwin Brian (Harry Ketchall)", "Julie Duncan (Peggy Baker)", "Sheila Roberts (Jitterbugger)", "Ed Cassidy (Mr. White (as Edward Cassidy))", "Mary Arden (Amy Clark - Juvenile Officer)", "Duke Johnson (Tom - Nightclub Manager)", "Johnny Duncan (Jitterbugger)", "Lindsay Bourquin (Nightclub Act (as Lindsay) (as Laverne and Betty))", "Laverne Thompson (Nightclub Act (as Lindsay) (as Laverne and Betty))", "Betty Phares (Nightclub Act (as Lindsay) (as Laverne and Betty))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
