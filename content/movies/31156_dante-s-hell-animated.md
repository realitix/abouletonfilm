It is a compelling four-quadrant film presented circle by circle in a chronological descent to the center of Hell, and to the exit into Purgatory. Dante's Hell Animated comes in two versions, one recited in primitive Italian in Dante's own words, and another narrated in English better understanding in this non-original language. Dante is guided by his hero Virgil through each circle of Hell and their subdivisions until they reach the center of the Earth and escaped to the other hemisphere into Purgatory. It features over 50 original color illustrations from the upcoming Dante's Hell comic book and magazine series, put together in a series of animation clips that will delight young and mature audiences.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p8lyS8vAQ9vpQ5gJ4tqtKneYeJR.jpg", "actors": ["Jeff Conaway (Circles Introduction (voice))", "Eric Roberts (Dante (voice))", "Vincent Spano (Virgil (voice: English version))", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cardona (Francesca (voice: English version))", "Nia Peeples (Beatrice (voice))", "Silvia Colloca (Beatrice (voice: Italian version))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
