Two of his friends, owning an airplane, gratify his desire by kidnapping him and depositing him on a moor near his birthplace. Thus, begins the adventure of the middle-aged Irish gentleman with his London-acquired manners and his full-dress suit contrasting with the humble clothes of the villagers. He forms a friendship with a pretty, young colleen, Moira Flaherty, and aids her in reforming her sweetheart, Sean Casey, who has joined a gang illegally distilling whiskey. The gang is led by an American gangster, Mike Finnegan, who has also returned to his boyhood home. The two old-sod homeboys vie for control of the hearts and minds of the villagers, with O'Connor having the distinct advantage of being able to sing the old Irish ballads.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
