Roza agrees, thinking that Samson is also cheating on her. Meanwhile, Detective Alemayehu\u2019s team investigates the case of a man found dead in a hotel room. Hirut, the man\u2019s widow, is also having an affair with Wondwossen and plans to give him her inheritance money. When the case of Roza\u2019s dead husband comes to Detective Alemayehu, he suspects a connection with the first case. Because Roza didn\u2019t use all the poison that Wondwossen gave her, Samson wakes up in his coffin before burial and secretly leaves the city. The detectives gather information that increasingly points to Hirut and Roza as the killers and to Wondwossen as the link between them. As Roza and Wondwossen celebrate their freedom and wealth, Samson plans his vengeful return.
