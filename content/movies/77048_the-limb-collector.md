A truly jolly and dedicated innkeeper who happens to have an unusual (some may say, revolting) hobby, he goes a long way to treat his guests to a delightful stay; however, whenever the urge to expand his collection flares up, the visits tend to last quite a bit longer. Bob\u2019s overzealous sons [SHAWN C. PHILLIPS &amp; M.J. KELLEY) strive to serve their father well, but their constant bungling could spoil his entire collection forever. In the meantime, Uncle Bob gets busy in the basement, generously putting one lovely lady after another in a position to have her beautiful body (parts) admired for many years to come.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
