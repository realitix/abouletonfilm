In order to make it onto the screen, they must clear all manner of obstacles, from fussy clients to obsessive regulators and restrictive rights issues. X-Rated takes a look at these outlawed pieces of advertising, revealing the most explicit, controversial and shocking ads never seen. These are ads that break all manner of taboos, from sex, violence, blasphemy, homosexuality, animal cruelty, rapping pensioners, swearing children, suicidal toys and naked athletes to Kylie in her undies on a bucking bronco. Amongst the contributors are advertising executives, producers and censors. The programme also takes a look at the embarrassing world of western celebrities in Japanese ads.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8N2XfJfXNLu3PE0QxXr5mCQlRuC.jpg", "actors": ["Doon Mackichan (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
