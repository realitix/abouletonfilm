Costas Ghoussis, an emigrant recently returned to his native country, is coming back from the fields, a shovel on his shoulder. He pushes open the garden gate in front of his house and calls his wife: Eleni! She does not answer; the reason: she is hidden behind the door of the kitchen with another man, Christos, a gamekeeper, the lover that she took during her husband's absence. Just as Costas crosses the threshold he is attacked and strangled. Despite their precautions, a relative of the victim suspects them and alerts the police. The criminals confess their crime. The reconstruction is that of the examining magistrate, whose inquiries are interspersed with sequences of the crime - although the actual murder is never shown - and with a social documentary which a TV unit (including the director himself) is making about the crime and the village.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3qUKdQCyUxBl1POVbCkYDj5sonj.jpg", "actors": ["Toula Stathopoulou (Eleni)", "Yannis Totsikas (Hristos Gikas)", "Thanos Grammenos (Eleni's Brother)", "Petros Hoedas (Investigator)", "Mihalis Fotopoulos (Kostas Gousis)", "Yannis Balaskas (Police officer)", "Nicos Alevras (Investigator's assistant)", "Theo Angelopoulos (Journalist)", "Christos Paliyannopoulos (Journalist)", "Adonis Lykouresis (Journalist)", "Giorgos Arvanitis ()", "Alekos Alexiou ()", "Mersoula Kapsali ()", "Telis Samandas ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [47792, 114645, 145147, 5282], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
