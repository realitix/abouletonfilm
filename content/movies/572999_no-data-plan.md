We do not talk about immigration on her Obama phone. For that we use the other number with no data plan.\u201d The linear train ride moving from Los Angeles to New York diverges into unruly directions of consciousness. A multiplicity of voices share thoughts, dreams and histories evoking images far away from the enclosed spaces of this trains interior.
