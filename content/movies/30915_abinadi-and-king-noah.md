Though Abinadi is killed after fulfilling this mission, his words touch Alma\u2019s heart. Alma, one of the priests, repents and soon brings many people to the waters of baptism as a missionary of the coming Christ. Will these true believers also escape persecution from King Noah?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zN6HddPNlpMQYwVXXCdqChGgi5R.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
