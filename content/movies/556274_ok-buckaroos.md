Jerry Jeff Walker's music has led him from the nation's biggest arenas to hundred-year old honky-tonks; from upstate New York to the beaches of Key West and the hustling sidewalks of New Orleans to the solace of the Texas Hill Country - and for beyond. He's been a cog in the wheel of the recording industry's star-making machinery and an involuntary pioneer on the frontier of artistic independence. He wrote one of the biggest mainstream hits of all time and still managed to help jump start a maverick musical movement.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lktswwfnAWx6tjxbCZd8VdFrSqG.jpg", "actors": ["Jerry Jeff Walker ()", "Susan Walker ()", "Ray Wylie Hubbard ()", "Todd Snider ()", "Bruce Robison ()", "Jimmy Buffett ()", "Willie Nelson ()", "Kris Kristofferson ()", "Guy Clark ()", "Joe Ely ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
