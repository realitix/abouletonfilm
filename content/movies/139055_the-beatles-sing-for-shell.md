It was screened on 1 July 1964 as an hour-long special, The Beatles Sing For Shell, named after the oil company which sponsored the broadcast.  Nine of The Beatles' Melbourne performances were included in the show (the others edited out and discarded at the insistence of Beatles manager Brian Epstein): I Saw Her Standing There, You Can't Do That, All My Loving, She Loves You, Till There Was You, Roll Over Beethoven, Can't Buy Me Love, Twist And Shout and Long Tall Sally.  The complete unedited concert (from an alternate audio feed) was also aired on Australian radio.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/esGjNxyhtRjdlVVbgumbYWutlxl.jpg", "actors": ["John Lennon (Self)", "Paul McCartney (Self)", "George Harrison (Self)", "Ringo Starr (Self)", "Jimmy Nicol (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
