His rival in love, Councillor Lindorf, claims that Hoffmann knows nothing of the heart, and so goads Hoffmann into telling the tales of his three great loves \u2013 each destroyed by a villain who bears an uncanny resemblance to Lindorf\u2026  First Hoffmann tells of his infatuation for the mechanical doll, Olympia \u2013 who is destroyed by the inventor Copp\u00e9lius. Next comes the courtesan Giulietta, who throws over his adoration in favour of jewels from the magician Dappertutto. Finally, the gentle Antonia is forced to sing to her death by the wicked Doctor Miracle. His stories finished, Hoffmann rouses from his drunken stupor to find Lindorf has made off with Stella, Hoffmann\u2019s latest love \u2013 but the Muse compels him to transform his heartache into art.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qaExCHFnRJtSqMa02yBxUhiAseu.jpg", "actors": ["Vittorio Grigolo (Hoffman)", "Thomas Hampson (Four Villans)", "Sofia Fomina (Olympia)", "Christine Rice (Giulietta)", "Sonya Yoncheva (Antonia)", "Kate Lindsey (Nicklausse)", "Christophe Mortagne (Spalanzani)", "Eric Halfvarson (Crespe)", "Eric Halfvarson (Crespel)", "Vincent Ordonneau (Four Servants)", "Catherine Carby (Spirit of Antonia's Mothe)", "Catherine Carby (Spirit of Antonia's Mothe)", "Catherine Carby (Spirit of Antonia's Mother)", "David Junghoon Kim (Nathanael)", "Charles Rice (Hermann)", "Yuriy Yurchuk (Schlemil)", "Jeremy White (Luther)", "Olga Sabadoch (Stella)", "Evelino Pid\u00f2 (Conductor)", "Sergey Levitin (Concert Master)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
