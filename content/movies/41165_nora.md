She enchants him with her frank, direct and uninhibited manner, and before long, he's convinced her to come with him to Trieste, where he has a job with Berlitz. Over time, Nora pulls him through phobias, tolerates his drinking, takes in his brother Stan, and bests Joyce at 'the writin' game' to bring him back to Italy from Dublin where he's gone to open a cinema. But his sexual jealousy threatens the relationship and sends her back to Galway with the children. Is there any way to tame Jim's green-eyed monster? And, will the lad ever get his stories published?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3G1dPq5hf9g7m98uKrksBIu1kbL.jpg", "actors": ["Ewan McGregor (James Joyce)", "Susan Lynch (Nora Barnacle)", "Andrew Scott (Michael Bodkin)", "Peter McDonald (Stanislaus Joyce)", "Roberto Citran (Roberto Prezioso)", "Vinnie McCabe (Uncle Tommy)", "Veronica Duffy (Annie Barnacle)", "Pauline McLynn (Miss Kennedy)", "Aedin Moloney (Eva Joyce)", "Paul Hickey (Curran)", "Neil\u00ed Conroy (Maid)", "Darragh Kelly (Cosgrave)", "Alan Devine (Gogarty)", "Kate O'Toole (Miss Delahunty)", "Martin Murphy (George Russell)", "Monica Scattini (Amalia Globocnik)", "Adrian McCourt (Eyers)", "Ignazio Oliva (Alessandro Francini Bruni)", "Stefania Montorsi (Clothilde Francini Bruni)", "Carla Cassola (Signora Canarutto)", "Stefania Orsola Garello (Signorina Canarutto)", "Franco Trevisi (Tullio Sylvestri)", "Eamonn Hunt (George Roberts)", "Sile Nugent (Maid 2)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "JT367gsMEvo"}
