When she wakes, she finds in her pocket a strange Polaroid of herself with a mysterious man. This brush with the unknown draws her away from home and inexorably down a rabbit hole peopled with urchins, dealers, and a host of characters that the rest of the world has forgotten. For Cassie every choice leads her closer to the strangers in the picture - not only the man whose name is whispered among vagrants, but the woman she thought she knew as well.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/znCpXSQpYn9BvdwkXof9hb0akqQ.jpg", "actors": ["Alanna Blair (Cassie)", "Robert Manning Jr. (Sid)", "Steve Berg (Dean)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
