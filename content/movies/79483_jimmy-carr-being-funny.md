Star of hit TV shows 8 Out of 10 Cats and 10 O\u2019clock Live, Jimmy is well known for his slick one liners and non-stop gags, but his acerbic wit and fast-paced comedy style are at their brilliant best when he has the stage to himself. Packed with over 100 minutes of brand new material, including too-rude-for-TV jokes, hilarious heckling, and even better put-downs, Jimmy pushes the boundaries of comedy and delivers a spectacular show.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/PBf9flyZkkWDUFnFLfMII6YQFt.jpg", "actors": ["Jimmy Carr (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [238177, 49381, 15429, 15372], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
