Richard Greene stars as the titular Scarlett, who sets about righting wrongs as he gathers supporters and catches the eyes of the babes. It\u2019s a sort of low rent Robin Hood, the Gallic version, Greene is dandy as usual, the costuming pleasing and with it running at just 75 minutes it moves along fast enough and doesn\u2019t outstay its welcome. But it\u2019s all pretty stale and way down on the list of swashbucklers to see before you die. 4/10"}], "recommandations_id": [74753, 87669, 69973, 268554]}
