Coupled with Ballard's penchant for polish, Johnny Rzeznik's introspection on \"Without You Here\" hews close to the center line before Robbie Takac's \"Listen\" gives the album a much-needed jolt of energy. The album's featured cover, a faithful, contemporary AOR-friendly take on Supertramp's \"Give a Little Bit,\" is emblematic of the Goo Goo Dolls fortunes here: They often seemed boxed in by a past that's not necessarily their own. --Jerry McCulley", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gwFrB1Upr4PLdLOIbOvpj8FXS0u.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
