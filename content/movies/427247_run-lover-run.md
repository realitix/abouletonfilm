The dilemma: Brigitte is a tomboy, and more likely to wallop a suitor than wink at him. Luckily, the neighbor's son Alan Tang is returning from obtaining his nuclear physics degree, and seems to be the perfect catch. Mom sets her trap, and Brigitte and Alan are roped in, much to their dismay! Ever the canny young girl, Brigitte does her best to pawn Alan off on her brother's girlfriend...but her heart tells her ever so slightly that she might have made a mistake! Can she win Alan back?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vcmPybgY9DPWoOGIQXZUPy9kHVG.jpg", "actors": ["Alan Tang (Yang I-fan)", "Brigitte Lin (Hsu Li Ping)", "Liu Shang-Chien ()", "Ha Ling-Ling ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
