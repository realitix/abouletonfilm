His loyal steward, Flavius, tries to warn him of the financial consequences of such reckless expenditure, while the cynical philosopher Apemantus mocks his naivety, but Timon ignores them both. When his money runs out and his creditors demand payment, Timon sends confidently to his \"friends\" for help. When all refuse him, he throws one last party - one that heralds a dramatic change in his attitude to the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b95Xx73IJLSZtaJO0qdywM6fy7x.jpg", "actors": ["Joseph Ziegler (Timon)", "Mike Nadajewski (Painter)", "Josue Laboucane (Poet)", "Rodrigo Beilfuss (Jeweller)", "Qasim Khan (Merchant)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
