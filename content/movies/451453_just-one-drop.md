Homeopathy treats the entire person, not just the disease. It\u2019s a specific form of medicine that uses minute doses of a highly diluted substance that stimulates the body to cure itself. It is these tiny doses that causes the most controversy. Researchers believe there is a release of energy in water that becomes mysteriously dynamic. Others think it\u2019s purely psychological or worse, a form of deception or quackery. Yet millions claim homeopathy cures even though there is not yet a satisfying scientific explanation. It remains a mystery.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xTjjWsL5iuAQ8kZP3ClTdCqy7wd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
