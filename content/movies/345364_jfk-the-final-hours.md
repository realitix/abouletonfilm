Kennedy. The film pretty much traces his actions from the time he landed in Texas until his arrival in Dallas where he would of course be assassinated. The film starts off to a rather shocking, to me anyway, claim and that's the fact that Paxton himself was able to see Kennedy and have a photograph taken of himself in a crowd listening to the President give a speech the day before he was killed. Perhaps this here was known to fans of the actor but I personally never knew this but as the film plays out you see how those directly linked to the President on this day will never forget what happened and probably more than most people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6i8dpdXDL52Ycjta8rZL4F2sEE.jpg", "actors": ["Ian Harris (JFK (voice))", "Clint Hill (Himself)", "Elizabeth Lambert (Jackie Kennedy (voice))", "Lisa McCubbin (Herself)", "Bill Paxton (Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
