This is a different kind of show from Cliff; a show featuring a swing band (the titular brass), a different take on old songs, and a host of songs he has never sung before.

Indeed, he tried out the formula in his 40th anniversary show (also at Royal Albert Hall) and others.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eKbuAikRxKbb7OxDrS9jht2kBjV.jpg", "actors": ["Cliff Richard (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
