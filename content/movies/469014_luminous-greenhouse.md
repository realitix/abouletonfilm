Unfamiliar color and light sweep into and literally illuminate vegetative subjects to supply visible evidence of a surreptitious conspiracy between the artist, her materials, and photochemical occurrences.  The digital video loops endlessly like events in the natural world even while they are contained in a structure designed for human dominance over Mother Nature.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3H4qsKWUCXe9mxCDMyvlvJE3JC.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
