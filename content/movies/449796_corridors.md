Paul's Super8 films, shot entirely in New York City, channel the blissed out states of color drenched psychadellia explored by Brakage as well as lovely black and white still life's that reminisce on Ozu's 'pillow shots' & Chantel Akermans monumental portrait of Pre-Giuliani New York 'Letters Home'. Jefre's music is culled from the same sessions that launched his 2007 release on Students Of Decay 'Shinning Skull Breath', (the two share a track in common). Billowy clouds of distorted guitar expand out into long passages of muffled static and fuzzed out melody.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wsFIOTb0yLjLTQTagnvOlcPT51b.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
