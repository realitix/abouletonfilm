{"tmdb_id": 553517, "title": "Berg: Wozzeck", "original_title": "Berg: Wozzeck", "slug_title": "berg-wozzeck", "date": "2017-04-24", "genre": ["Drame"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "Separated and fragmented, the scenes combine in a series of tableaux to tell the story of Wozzeck, an ordinary soldier whose only solace is the love of his companion Marie. However, the latter\u2019s fidelity is not unfailing and Wozzeck is haunted by torment. His officers and comrades in arms do little to improve the situation. The omnipresent tension in this profoundly romantic work unifies the fifteen scenes with their complex tonalities alternating between Verist notes and the force of ritualised actions. Christoph Marthaler\u2019s production provides an atmosphere of contemporaneity strongly accentuated by the choice of a single set, where the men\u2019s despair is submerged in Berg\u2019s dearly sought-after sobriety.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2Wc27K5UZ5HQrq1CkiU0HwbeTKE.jpg", "actors": ["Johannes Martin Kr\u00e4nzle (Wozzeck)", "Stefan Margita (Tambour-Major)", "Gun-Brit Barkmin (Marie)", "Mikhail Timoshenko (Erster Handwerksbursch)", "Michael Sch\u00f8nwandt (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
