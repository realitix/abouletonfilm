Well, The Insider, with the above clever formula does exist and it is definitely an earthly paradise. Russell Crowe is a tobacco industry researcher named Jeffrey Wigand who accidentally revealed a addictive substance abuse in a famous tobacco company named Big Tobacco. He appeared in a CBS program \u201c60 Minutes\u201d based on an invitation by its presenter, Mike Wallace. His fate changed drastically, he had no choice but to sacrifice his reputation, job and family. In contrast to his heroic role in Gladiator, Crowe here plays excellently as a hero who tries to fight for his freedom as it is taken away when he has to deal with corporate criminals. Al Pacino performs well as usual in his role as an investigating journalist named Lowell Bergman. Mann attractively packed this 2,5 hour long crime drama with a variety of careful analysis so that this film is away from boring."}], "recommandations_id": [1900, 4566, 231, 820], "youtube_key": "5rkvxi5hdbA"}
