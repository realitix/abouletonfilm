Carrying over their antics from RKO Radio's \"Mexican Spitfire\" series, Lupe Velez and Leon Errol star respectively as Havana nightclub entertainer Madame La Zonga and South American aristocrat Senor Alvarez. What the audience knows but La Zonga doesn't is that Alvarez is a phony, who's no more Latin than a Coney Island hot dog.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vWzYpXmQcxviwWpQJ5xsRhpgY6q.jpg", "actors": ["Lupe V\u00e9lez (Madame La Zonga)", "Leon Errol (Mike Clancy / Papa Alvarez)", "William Frawley (Chauncey Beheegan)", "Helen Parrish (Rosie Clancy / Rosita Alvarez)", "Charles Lang (Steve Morrison)", "Shemp Howard (Gabby)", "Eddie Quillan (Skat)", "Guinn Williams (Alvin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
