Before the Kuomintang forces withdrew from Peiping, they adopted a series of psychological policies for the literary and art circles, hoping that they would also leave Beiping together. The leaders of the Communist Party of China, such as Mao Zedong, who was far away from Xibaipo, also paid great attention to the people of the literary and art circles in Beijing. They sent Tian Han and other comrades to appease and sympathize. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party launched a silent war against the literary and art circles.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5OXvNLCZwqFcFG2iEd5shvjl2em.jpg", "actors": ["Tang Guoqiang (Mao Zedong)", "Zifeng Liu (Qi Baishi)", "Wang Wufu ()", "Hou Chang-Rong ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
