GENERATION RX presents \"the rest of the story\" and unveils how this era of unprecedented change in Western culture really occurred - and what price has been paid by our society. International award-winning filmmaker Kevin P. Miller (Let Truth Be The Bias, The Promised Land) \"delivers a jaw-dropping emotional ride,\" and \"weaves a terrifying tale of criminal conspiracy, the mass abandonment of medical ethics, and the routine betrayal of an entire generation.\" By employing the expertise of internationally respected professionals from the fields of medicine, ethics, journalism, and academia, GENERATION RX investigates collusion between drug companies and their regulatory watchdogs at the FDA and focuses on the powerful stories of real families who followed the advice of their doctors - and faced devastating consequences for doing so.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wSadfIiMPwToTXwddfebXRPGzXu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
