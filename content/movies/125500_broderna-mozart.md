Now, he has to deal with the violent objection from the actors, the musicians, the singing coach, the stage manager, and even the cafe bar attendants and the cleaners. The situation is further complicated as the director is such a womanizer like Don Juan... and his lovers and kids keep bugging him throughout the rehearsal...", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2DdYPzDcMhOPCx3HoeYCk0gBeqQ.jpg", "actors": ["Etienne Glaser (Walter)", "Philip Zand\u00e9n (Flemming)", "Henry Bronett (Fritz)", "Loa Falkman (Eskil / Don Juan)", "Helge Skoog (Olof / Don Ottavio)", "Lena T.
