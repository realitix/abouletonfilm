It was the longest film ever released until 2011. Composed over 36 years from 1978 until 2006, it consists of a series of over 2,821 silent vignettes (cin\u00e9matons), each 3 minutes and 25 seconds long, of various celebrities, artists, journalists and friends of the director, each doing whatever they want for the allotted time. Subjects of the film include directors Barbet Schroeder, Nagisa Oshima, Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff, Ken Loach, Benjamin Cuq, Youssef Chahine, Wim Wenders, Joseph Losey, Jean-Luc Godard, Samuel Fuller and Terry Gilliam, chess grandmaster Jo\u00ebl Lautier, and actors Roberto Benigni, St\u00e9phane Audran, Julie Delpy and Lesley Chatterley. Gilliam is featured eating a 100-franc note, while Fuller smokes a cigar. Courant's favourite subject was a 7-month-old baby. The film was screened in its then-entirety in Avignon in November 2009 and was screened in Redondo Beach, CA on April 9, 2010.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kecEf5sVHqOXIpkqRGDYaiscgT5.jpg", "actors": ["Fernando Arrabal (himself)", "Ga\u00ebl Badaud (himself)", "Roberto Benigni (himself)", "Juliet Berto (herself)", "Sandrine Bonnaire (herself)", "Nicoletta Braschi (herself)", "Raymonde Carasco (herself)", "G\u00e9rard Courant (himself)", "Patrick Poivre d'Arvor (himself)", "V\u00e9ronique Delbourg (herself)", "Julie Delpy (herself)", "Martine Elzingre (herself)", "Philippe Garrel (himself)", "Terry Gilliam (himself)", "Jean-Luc Godard (himself)", "Marcel Hanoun (himself)", "Teo Hern\u00e1ndez (himself)", "Dani\u00e8le Huillet (herself)", "Jakobois (himself)", "Robert Kramer (himself)", "Gabrielle Lazure (herself)", "Boris Lehman (himself)", "Rose Lowder (herself)", "St\u00e9phane Marti (himself)", "Pascal Martin (himself)", "Serge Merlin (himself)", "Jacques Monory (himself)", "Joseph Morder (himself)", "Michel Nedjar (himself)", "Gaspar No\u00e9 (himself)", "Dominique Noguez (himself)", "Nagisa \u014cshima (Himself)", "Sergei Parajanov (himself)", "Maurice Pialat (himself)", "Jackie Raynal (herself)", "Martine Rousset (herself)", "Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff (himself)", "Michael Snow (himself)", "Jean-Marie Straub (himself)", "Katerina Thomadaki (herself)", "Wim Wenders (himself)", "Yoshishige Yoshida (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "hDUOo60xS3M"}
