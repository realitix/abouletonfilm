Lord Mito is the sage who wanders the countryside rectifying government corruption along with his faithful attendants Suke-san and Kaku-san.  The historical Mito Komon aka Tokugawa Mitsukuni (1628-1700) was the grandson of shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu.  During the latter half of the Edo period and the Meiji period, a k\u014ddan (narrative tale) named \"Mito Mitsukuni Man'y\u016bki\" fictionalized the travels of Tokugawa Mitsukuni. This tradition of dramatizing his life continued with a novel and, in 1951, the first television series to portray him as a wanderer, masquerading as a commoner, who castigated the evil powers in every corner of the nation. In 1969, the TBS series Mito K\u014dmon began, and today continues to attract audiences.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
