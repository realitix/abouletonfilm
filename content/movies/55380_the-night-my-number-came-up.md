Amongst those listening is Air Marshal Hardie who is due to fly to Tokyo the next day. Hardie initially dismisses the dream because he is scheduled to fly out in a Liberator, but as Hardie arrives at the airport he discovers that the Liberator has developed mechanical problems and has been replaced by a Dakota. When, just before the flight is due to depart, two soldiers board the plane making a complement of eight, Hardie fears that the dream may be coming true and he is destined to die.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fhUD5SGbtAG4bX3tAsYF7rkP3VJ.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Redgrave (Air Marshal Hardie)", "Sheila Sim (Mary Campbell)", "Alexander Knox (Owen Robertson)", "Denholm Elliott (Fl.
