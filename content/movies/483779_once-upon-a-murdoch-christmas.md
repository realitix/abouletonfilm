When witnesses insist the culprit exhibited superhuman abilities, Constable Crabtree (Jonny Harris, Still Standing) realizes the robber bears a striking resemblance to the title character of his new graphic novel, Jumping Jack. As more robberies targeting gifts from Eaton's luxury department occur around Toronto, Murdoch and his team are forced to consider the possibility that Crabtree's character has come to life. As Station House No. 4 contends with the real-life Jumping Jack, Inspector Brackenreid (Thomas Craig, Coronation Street) orders the formation of a police choir, and Dr. Julia Ogden (H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Joy, Durham County) tries to help two orphans who mistake her for a fairytale heroine. Can Murdoch and his team stop Jumping Jack from stealing Christmas?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vKjjDepIQ5JGxznoAI45b4wNR9Q.jpg", "actors": ["Yannick Bisson (Detective William Murdoch)", "Helene Joy (Dr. Julia Ogden)", "Jonny Harris (Constable George Crabtree)", "Lachlan Murdoch (Constable Henry Higgins)", "Mouna Traor\u00e9 (Rebecca James)", "Kristian Bruun (Constable Jackson)", "Arwen Humphreys (Margaret Brackenreid)", "Frank Moore (Lance Henderson)", "Joel Keller (Marlin Edwards)", "Jeni Ross (Vicky Parsons)", "Thomas Craig (Inspector Thomas Brackenreid)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
