It traces the individual experience, showing the emptiness one can feel as well as the discovery of a sense of meaning in life. It is a very personal and courageous film that doesn\u2019t search for scientific explanations but instead uses documentary and fictional material to weave an intimate biography. This combination of perception and memory suggests a deep reconciliation and allows tender feelings of a mother\u2019s love to emerge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9Zhgx7S0TKtksEXO5XXBOfl3xuC.jpg", "actors": ["Heidi Diggelmann (Old Mother)", "Ilaria Flego (Child)", "Miro Svercel (Father)", "Yvonne Vonlanthen (Young Mother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
