She inspires the young generation to chase their goals and the rest of us - to be proud of Lithuania. Ruta is much more than a great athlete, she is the symbol of today's Lithuania. Currently a documentary is being produced that will allow the viewers to see Ruta's daily life from up close and hopefully understand a bit more about the amount of hard work that goes into preparing for this short distance swim.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c3MjZm1d68XVD3zWRT7xlz8ZTPq.jpg", "actors": ["R\u016bta Meilutyt\u0117 (Herself)", "Mindaugas Meilutis (Brother)", "Saulius Meilutis (Father)", "Aldona Meilutien\u0117 (Grandmother)", "Jon Rudd (Coach)", "Paris Payne (Coach)", "Marijonas Mikutavi\u010dius (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "ENu88szxI74"}
