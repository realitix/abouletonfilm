But since moving to Vila Andaru, Yudha's life changed to become very horrible. He often encountered oddities. Elisa and Dewa are two students who are looking for Elisa's missing brother (Erlita). They stayed at Cempaka Lodge, right next to Vila Andaru.  Elisa and Dewa both have the ability to see spirits. The difference is that Elisa is still afraid, especially when she sees the hanging spirit (Rasti) who often haunts him at the Inn.
