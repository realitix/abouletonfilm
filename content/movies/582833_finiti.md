First exhibited at the Centre Multimedia Gantner in 2011, then on an immersive 18 metre curved screen at Tate Britain in 2012. It explores an interplay between abstracted colour, personal imagery and war related newsreel, seeking a coherent set of linking themes. Perhaps an homage to Dziga Vertov. A single screen version was made in 2013 and shown in Millennium, New York and at Tate Britain.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5sRMGmR0a47lBcrSv6u0QR72Rad.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
