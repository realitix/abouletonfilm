I saw the amazing short that was the basis for this film a few years ago, and it packed more punch in 7 minutes than this version packs in 105 minutes.\r\n\r\nEveryone does their job well, the acting is uniformly good, the cinematography and setting are great.  The problem is, the story is too thin and lacks depth.  There are a couple of interesting ideas, the 48 hour time-line of the infection, the wrist bands counting down the 48 hours.  But the padding of the plot feels forced and ultimately unnecessary.  Everything could have been and probably should have been wrapped up in a much shorter time frame, and that is why the short film worked so well.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it was a good enough film, but considering the source it should have been amazing.\r\n\r\n6/10"}, {"pseudo": "Gimly", "content": "Had kind of hoped for more, but this is okay. _Cargo_ isn't **exactly** like any other zombie deal out there though, so if your demands are low enough, there's some value.\r\n\r\nFinal rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole."}], "recommandations_id": [429415, 433808, 475210, 424121]}
