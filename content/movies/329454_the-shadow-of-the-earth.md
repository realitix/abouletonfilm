When he sees that their sheep are threatened with a possibly devastating illness, the precarious nature of the group's existence is brought home to him and he leaves to gain a livelihood and knowledge in the city. Once he gets back, bringing money and presents, it first appears that the group will be assured of a better future because of his enterprising outreach. Yet military and governmental officials arrive on the scene to take a census and the young man is conscripted, against his will.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iq52mQ5ssYC3gfrRnO7T1kAv7o4.jpg", "actors": ["Despina Tomazani ()", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Catzaras ()", "Mouna Noureddine ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
