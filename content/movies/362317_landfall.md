Moments of geometric clarity flicker into view, showing the fa\u00e7ade of a building or the corner of an imagined site. However, as these features and forms come into view, their rearrangements and reconfigurations reinforce an ambivalent feeling toward their construction and usefulness. As the upper half of the video becomes occupied by a ceiling of stripped stalactites, the glimmers of architecture become more pronounced, playing off the features of the space that has formed around us. \"  - Nicholas O'Brien", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Aopf8VFDGzaO14u1hNOZ3qzwBCm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
