Abimelech, the Philistine satrap of Gaza, enters to mock the Hebrews' God, proclaiming the superiority of Dagon, and the Hebrews are afraid of him. But calls them to show some defiance, so Abimelech attacks Samson with his sword. Samson seizes the sword and strikes him dead. The Hebrews scatter and the High Priest of Dagon appears, cursing the Hebrews. When a messenger reports that the Hebrews are ravaging the harvest, the High Priest forms a plan to use Delilah to overcome Samson's strength. Delilah's beauty is such that Samson can't resist her for long. She begs to know the secret of his supernatural strength, but he refuses, though he says he loves her. Delilah betrays Samson by having some Philistine soldiers seize him and throw him into a prison in Gaza, where his hair is cut off.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iv2ZU8c6yti9PR8ACDq7CXvx9A7.jpg", "actors": ["Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (Samson)", "Shirley Verrett (Dalila)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
