She visits an old family flat in a remote apartment by the sea. Heavily sedated with medication and alcohol, she tries to decode her life through the pages of a journal. Walking on a deserted Norfolk beach she finds a dying mutant mermaid foetus. Initially repulsed, she becomes obsessed with it, takes it home and tries to resuscitate it. Dawn\u2019s Swedish friend Milla visits at the weekend. While out drinking with Dawn, she catches a man at an unguarded moment and they end up in bed. In the cellar, the creature can sense the vibrations from the bedroom. Feeding off the sexual energy coursing through the flat, the creature strengthens and grows. After Milla leaves, Dawn checks on the creature in the cellar; it\u2019s covered in a thin slime. Drawn to the smell, she tastes it and finds that it has hallucinogenic effects. Dawn\u2019s life is about to get even stranger.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uw5IQ6Dx6TeBGFLx7lGX4dzuYV8.jpg", "actors": ["Frida Farrell (Milla)", "Brendan Gregory (Dr. Reece)", "Jodie Jameson (Dawn)", "Bart Ruspoli (John)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
