That's because this ersatz 41-minute short subject was actually comprised of ten individual episodes from the Saturday morning TV cartoon series The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show. Each of the film's vignettes concerns affairs of the heart, with emphasis on Charlie Brown's puppy-love yearnings for The Little Red-Haired Girl. The best scene concerns a date between hoydenish Peppermint Patty and Beagle-About-Town Snoopy. She Likes You, Charlie Brown was assembled by Mendelson-Melendez productions for the home video market.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
