Instead, Blind Guardian decided to create their own festival, back in their homeland. The First Blind Guardian Festival was held in Coburg, Germany, at June 16\u201317, 2003. It lasted 2 days, with the band playing during both nights. The entire show has been professionally recorded and subsequently released on a DVD entitled Imaginations through the Looking Glass in June 14, 2004.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fPbLpEIqgJcIxhbGi8klI69FlhR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
