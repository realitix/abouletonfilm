The resilience of this Syrian community, which currently makes up one fifth of the population in Lebanon, is astoundingly clear as its members work hard to collaborate, share resources, and advocate for themselves in a new land. With the Syrian conflict continuing to push across borders, lives are becoming increasingly desperate due to the devastating consequences of new visa laws that the Lebanese government has implemented, leaving families at risk of arrest, detention, and deportation. Despite these obstacles, the film encourages us to look beyond the staggering statistics of displaced refugees and focus on the individuals themselves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/59l941HDtXxENBWJoZjbVT3abxZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
