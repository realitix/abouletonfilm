Thus entrapped, he agrees to be part of Mogambha's gang and is asked to work together with Pinky Nathani and Mike. Subsequently, Ratan is asked to kill Ajit Saxena, the Commissioner of Police, which he refuses to do. Mogambho's men then abduct his Secretary, Reddy, and his sister, Mala, and hold them for ransom until such time Ratan assassinates Ajit.
