Don't ask me why. I had previously loved the Hong Kong-made 'Infernal Affairs' trilogy on which this is based. Usually I hate when international masterpieces get remade, but this was a sterling exception. This was controversial when it took in a cartload of Oscars, particularly finally a directorial nod for Scorsese, but don't be misled--it's easily one of his finest works.\r\n\r\nThis is my Golden Rule on both remakes in general, but especially American remakes of international (particularly foreign-language) great films. When in doubt, check the label:\r\n\r\n1. Director? (check)\r\n2. Cast? (check)\r\n3. Script? (check)\r\n\r\n'The proof is in the pudding!'"}], "recommandations_id": [769, 1372, 107, 6977]}
