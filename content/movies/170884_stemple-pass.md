On the soundtrack, Benning himself reads extracts from Kaczynski\u2019s journals from the early 1970s, recording his progress at hunting and gathering, and his connection to the Montana wilderness; a hand-written folded sheet of paper detailing his acts of \u201cmonkey wrenching\u201d and first attempts at planting bombs; two notebooks written in numerical code in 1985 and decoded by Benning in 2011; two excepts from Industrial Society and Its Future by \"FC\" (aka the Unabomber Manifesto) as published in its entirety (35,000 words) in The New York Times and The Washington Post in 1995; and a 2001 interview with Kaczynski by J. Alienus Rychalski, special correspondent for the Blackfoot Valley Dispatch.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j3txR1n3VifVyQj0E5iYvKKU23c.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
