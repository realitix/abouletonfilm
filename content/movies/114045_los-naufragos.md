He asks questions, not only of those who stayed behind but also of himself, examining his relationship with his past and his own memory. The people who stayed lived through 20 years of dictatorship. They were either victims or executioners. Amidst this wreckage, Aron wonders what name his brother is using now, where his father is... Can he, in Isol's arms and through her love, find his way again ? What future awaits him? Like Mola the torturer, he has returned from an impossible journey, and Aron knows that each man is his own executioner. Shipwreck and resurrection are the two facets of a complex truth. Los Naufragios is the story of a man's journey in search of himself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xWYcdyaDjHd2FIMkyLWEAuCXhO3.jpg", "actors": ["Luis Alarc\u00f3n ()", "Basti\u00e1n Bodenh\u00f6fer ()", "Patricio Bunster ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "0lmtpy6KRrI"}
