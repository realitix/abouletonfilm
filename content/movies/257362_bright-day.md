But he has a plan \u2026 a plot to infiltrate and debunk Pyrasphere, Hollywood\u2019s fastest-growing, new-age religion!  Armed with only \u201cThe Truth\u201d, he drafts his brother-in-law (Matt Price, TV\u2019s Men of a Certain Age, Evan Almighty, Man on the Moon), a wedding/bar mitzvah videographer, and sets out to make his name.  Under the leadership of glamorous, fame-seeking guru Gossamyrhh (Maggie Rowe, Ocean\u2019s Thirteen, Fun With Dick and Jane), the duo encounters a wildly colorful collection of cultists, including his ex-wife (Amy Stiller, Tropic Thunder, Zoolander, The Cable Guy).  But is Gossamyrhh\u2019s philosophy actually genuine? Can Tripp really have it all through enlightenment \u2026 or is it a sham and part of a not-so-divine plan?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pdAddSSiLp0uwmJRjp2oZqlSMIN.jpg", "actors": ["Marc Evan Jackson (Tripp Bailey)", "Michael Cera (Himself)", "Richard Belzer (Himself)", "Bill Maher (Himself)", "Amy Stiller (Pam Bailey)", "Maggie Rowe (Gossamyrhh)", "Taylor Negron (Leicester Cohen-Blaize)", "Rick Overton (Dr. Alex Joyfrem)", "Laura Silverman (Jackie)", "Matt Price (Matt 'Buddy')", "Elaine Hendrix (Kathyrn Helen)", "Melinda Hill (Bonnie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
