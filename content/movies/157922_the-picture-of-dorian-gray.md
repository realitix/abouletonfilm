As the two enter into a close friendship, Basil crafts a remarkable piece of art that seems to capture Dorian's essence as much as it does the artist's obsession. Stricken by the remarkable beauty of the piece and lamenting his own inevitable loss of youth, the troubled Dorian makes a wish that the artistic rendering of him bear the weathers of time while he remains forever youthful. Later, as Dorian strikes up a friendship with Lord Henry, wealthy entitlement, decadence, and obsessive pleasure lead the handsome young noble down a dark path of drugs and dangerous friendships. When Basil attempts to help his old friend, the artist's nobility ends up costing him his life. Through it all, Dorian remains as hypnotically handsome as ever.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1ov76TsIgsM49GH0Xsv05cFrbMe.jpg", "actors": ["David Gallagher (Dorian Gray)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
