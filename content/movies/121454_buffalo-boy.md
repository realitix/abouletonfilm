Kim is 15; his father and step-mother have two buffalo, their lifeline as subsistence rice farmers. During the rainy season, there's no grass and the buffalo are starving. Kim volunteers to take the beasts inland to find food. On this coming-of-age journey, Kim sees men mistreat women, men fight with men, and French taxes rob the poor. He works for Lap, a buffalo herder whose past is entangled with Kim's parents, and he makes friends who will lead him to his place in the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j7aCMq6IosglJ4D6ebFeSfYyOL5.jpg", "actors": ["Kim Long Thach (Thanh)", "Thi Kieu Trinh Nguyen (Ban)", "The Lu Le (Kim)", "Huu Thanh Nguyen (Dinh, Kim's Father)", "Zan Sram Kra (Det)", "Van Be Truong (Hai Tich)", "Nguyen Anh Hoa (Ba Hai)", "Tham Nguyen Thi (Ba Tu)", "Hoang Nhan Vo (Lap)", "Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Quang Th\u1ecbnh (Quang)", "Nguyen Van Day (Xuyen)", "Thi Thu Tam Cao (Lam)", "Huu Phuoc Nguyen (Thieu)", "Chau Nguyen (Cha Ban)", "Trung Truc Thach (Kim, Age 5)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [36634, 161246, 76714, 32119], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
