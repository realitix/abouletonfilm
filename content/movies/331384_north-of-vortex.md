It unfolds almost entirely without dialogue (although with the voice of Kevin Graal as an all-seeing narrator) as the photogenic protagonists\u2019 classic convertible travels west across a timeless America of diners, pool halls and prairie landscapes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3ip5iVxZ6Ev8J6EM5A6DWzDuFNg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
