Nonetheless, Douglas is a commanding actor, and Montgomery does a good turn as the villainess. Along with the decent enough story, they give some gravitas to a TV movie generally confused in its own unrealised aesthetics. Either a touch more humour or seriousness might have done the trick. As it is, it's equal parts corny and sad, although good enough as an obscure viewing."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
