After a tragic accident, Ian Fletcher, a 15-year old Floridian, moves far north to live with his aunt and uncle. Shortly after his arrival, Ian is shipped off to Camp Manna, a backwoods Evangelical Christian camp soaked in baffling religious sub-culture. Camp Manna is centered around the God Games, a Biblically-themed Olympiad focused on turning boys into \"men of faith\". But as a \"nonbeliever\", this is the last place in the world that Ian wants to spend a week. He is bunked up with the Passover Privates, the cabin of outcasts and misfits, and their zealous, un-cool counselor Bradley Sommers. But when Ian is introduced to Clayton Vance, the savvy and chiseled counselor of the Righteous Regiment, he has one focus: Ditch Bradley and join up with Clayton.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/odqXgjozzM05RTHlyR4b0H1lSgp.jpg", "actors": ["Gary Busey (Jack Cujo Parrish)", "Jimmy Tatro (Clayton Vance)", "Joey Morgan (Gordo)", "Brett Johnson (Militant Counselor)", "Luke Kleintank (Ian Fletcher)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
