Situated 300 miles from the North Pole, where polar bears outnumber humans, and bearing the distinction of being the northernmost town in the world, Longyearbyen is a community with an unforgiving climate, dreary isolation and an uncertain economic future. Like many small towns, Longyearbyen was once a bustling industrial hub that\u2019s now struggling to find innovative ways to sustain itself. This Cold Life is filmmaker Darren Mann\u2019s visually stunning portrait that illuminates a tight-knit group of colourful and resourceful residents who are dedicated to preserving the land they call home. Through charming individual reflections, including two men who fought to change a law to establish a brewery and become the town\u2019s only export, we experience what it\u2019s like to live in unity for our neighbours\u2019 well-being.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/74ft2ouAs6RrrEI0FParSPtopah.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
