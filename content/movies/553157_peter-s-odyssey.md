But the happy days with the country house, the trees and the lake come to an abrupt end when his parents decide to emigrate to Germany. In the new, unfamiliar surroundings, Peter feels lost and he remains an outsider at school too.  The result is that he withdraws increasingly into his own private world and imagines how he could get back to his grandmother's on his own initiative.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yDPrmRhKccwCA0dinL4kRCNnvJL.jpg", "actors": ["Dmitry Gabrielyan (Petya/Peter)", "Svetlana Nemolyaeva (Grandma)", "Mariya Shashlova ()", "Alexey Yudnikov ()", "Natalya Kurepova ()", "Daniil Kamentsev ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "vmbqWQMSr7A"}
