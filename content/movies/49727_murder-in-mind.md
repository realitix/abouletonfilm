Dr. Ellis, a hypnotherapist, takes her back in time; with the police listening, a pattern of spousal abuse emerges. When each trance ends, however, the woman, Carolyn Walker, wonders if those repressed memories are true. Dr. Ellis guides her through her trial, testifies himself, and continues treatment after the verdict is in. Carolyn's memory and well-being get worse after the trial, not better. She misses some therapy sessions, and Dr. Ellis comes to see her at home. Snatches of memory come and go. Can he help her remember what really happened? Are the cops satisfied justice has been done?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7ja7EmLBmWZOf5CSXVDgnFUj1pd.jpg", "actors": ["Nigel Hawthorne (Dr. Ellis)", "Jimmy Smits (Peter Walker)", "Mary-Louise Parker (Caroline Walker)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
