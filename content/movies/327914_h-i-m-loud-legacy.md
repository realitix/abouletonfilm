Hosted by Loudwire\u2019s Graham \u2018Gruhamed\u2019 Hartmann, \u2018Loud Legacy\u2019 begins with the formation of HIM in 1991 and spans all the way into late 2014.  HIM existed for six years before the band\u2019s debut full-length, Greatest Love Songs: Vol. 666, was released. During that period, HIM struggled to find their own sound while going through a number of lineup changes. Ville famously worked at his father\u2019s sex shop to pay the rent, while bassist Mikko \u2018Mige\u2019 Paananen left HIM for a short time to complete military service.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mWt8Wz0hLRNtk9rBulEjkE83ekl.jpg", "actors": ["Ville Valo ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "PaSOTXJSLYw"}
