For many, he seems lost. Disconnected from the world around him, he is not doing well. On the days where we follow his life, he seems to undergo a fundamental transformation. Mario receives a letter from Japan with undecipherable content, since he doesn\u2019t speak Japanese. An important fact: Mario Kubo is the son of a Japanese immigrant and a Brazilian mother, daughter of Japanese immigrants. Despite considering himself Brazilian, he will always be seen as being \u201cJapanese\u201d by others. Due to a series of events, Kubo steps out of Freedom Station, in the Japanese neighborhood of S\u00e3o Paulo, after riding the last night train. Alone, he begins a journey after something that he is not quite sure what it is.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zoABlQgL4VJ9rwm5qBUn5d7KPii.jpg", "actors": ["Cau\u00ea Ito (Mario Kubo)", "Eduardo Chagas ()", "Kentaro Inoue ()", "Fabiula Nascimento ()", "Renata Sayuri ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
