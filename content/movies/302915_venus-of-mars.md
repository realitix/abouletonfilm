At home in Minneapolis with Lynette, her wife of twenty years, s/he's Steve. Born male, Venus is transgender. S/he's \"in between\" \u2014 taking female hormones, but not planning to have sexual reassignment surgery. To some, s/he's a pioneer, courageously exploring a brave new world of gender identity, free of categorization. To others, s/he's a freak. VENUS OF MARS is both the unique coming out story of Venus' gender-redefining journey, and the truly contemporary love story of a couple weathering dramatic changes in uncharted relationship territory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pu2HM1rYcfaYQC3GVxdrpxrPl11.jpg", "actors": ["Venus Demars ()", "Lynette Reini-Grandell ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
