Though the young guy is over his twenties, he still lives with his parents - spending their days watching TV. Vytas' girlfriend Ona is a bit different - she is independent, knows her likes and dislikes, has some friends - one of which she starts seeing more and more often. This leaves no sunshine in Vytas life at all and makes him wander for the truth in the maze of the blocked houses quarter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jzuoqi2ndUIxKYsP5AUCbuOxKJJ.jpg", "actors": ["Marius Rep\u0161ys (Vytas)", "Gelmin\u0117 Glem\u017eait\u0117 (Ona)", "Arvydas Dap\u0161ys (Vytas' father)", "Nel\u0117 Savi\u010denko (Vytas' mother)", "Darius \u0160il\u0117nas (Pizzeria visitor)", "Laurynas Barei\u0161a (Passer-by in the shop)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "z0ll-cC9QiE"}
