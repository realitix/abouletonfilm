Cherry Blossoms.\u201d I found this haiku to be a wonderful analogy for young love, as the fleeting nature of a spring romance should be cherished before it's gone as quickly as the cherry blossoms. The film itself is also structured like a haiku. Not counting the titles, the film is composed of 17 shots. 5 shots establish the garden, 7 depict the romance, and the final 5 focus on cherry blossoms.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4mbSN0DSXNot4iuA7nAipyicLCw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
