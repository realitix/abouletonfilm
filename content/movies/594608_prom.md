For four years, from 2006-2009, filmmaker Martin Bell and photographer Mary Ellen Mark travelled around the country and documented proms.  They went to twelve high schools in 10 cities, covering a wide range of ethnic and economic groups.  While Mary Ellen Mark made portraits of the Prom-goers with the 20x24 Polaroid camera, Martin Bell interviewed the students in an adjacent studio.  When the project finally came to a close, Bell had interviewed over three hundred students.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aCzZtjcqIES9kBKEzgG7UuGybGW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
