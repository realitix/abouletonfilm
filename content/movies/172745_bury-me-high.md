However, if a special ceremony is not performed on the grounds, then the luck will only last for 24 years. A trio of Chinese Americans decide to venture into these mountains hoping to change their luck; Anna Wong (Moon Lee) is an executive facing a corporate meltdown, Wisely (Chin Ka-Lok) is dying of brain cancer, and UCLA Prof. Chang (Tsui Siu-Ming) is an expert in feng shui. Tin can potentate General Nguen (Yuen Wah) also has designs on the grounds -- hoping to turn his third world, fourth rate country into a superpower. Along the way, the three heroes fall in with a group of local rebels, including the high-kicking Nguen Van Vong (Sibelle Hu).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5jwOI2rNP4ewIzkmhZGnB34Bk1z.jpg", "actors": ["Chin Ka-Lok (Wisely)", "Moon Lee (Anna Wong)", "Sibelle Hu (Nguen Van Vong)", "Yuen Wah (General Nguen)", "Tsui Siu-Ming (Prof. Chen Chang Ching)", "Lau Ji-Wai (Guerilla leader)", "Corey Yuen (Wei Tien Hsien)", "Kenneth Tsang (President of Carrinan)", "Paul Chun Pui (Mr Nguen)", "Cho Wing (Capt.
