In the course of an ongoing career that encompasses ground-breaking music, global gigging, award winning albums, and as many front covers &amp; critical backslaps as one lifetime can sensibly handle, Malmsteen has virtually reinvented the guitar as an instrument to be seen with. This DVD set includes 4 promo videos (\"Bedroom Eyes,\" \"Heaven Tonight,\" \"Save Our Love,\" and \"You Don't Remember\"), plus an interview with Barry Barnes conducted in 2006 at Malmsteen's studio in Miami, FL.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kqyX9DBmLRTmkoU0WwfNv5UJDwA.jpg", "actors": ["Yngwie Malmsteen ()", "Jeff Scott Soto ()", "Joe lynn Turner ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
