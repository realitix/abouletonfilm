A window front, seen through the window. Changing flower arrangements on a side table. Sounds, entering the room from outside the frame. A construction site hints at changes in the exterior. Rehearsals. Are the sound waves of the piano reaching us from downstairs or from next door? In 21.3\u00b0C Helena Wittmann reduces the filmic elements to the essentials: light, shadow, sound, direction. Out of this minimum, stories emerge that linger, atmospheres that resonate. Little by little the viewer is thrown back upon herself/himself. Through the facing window front someone seems to look back at us. Only the temperature remains the same.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/CAhuwyoITiMhBgkKgSMfnEImuJ.jpg", "actors": ["Luise Donschen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
