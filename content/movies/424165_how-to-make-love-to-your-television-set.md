You and I, in all our obstinate, unpredictable glory and complexity, are the message. The ultimate power lies on this, the other side of the TV screen, in the eye and mind of the viewer who can increasingly become the actor.\u201d This performative broadcast \u2013 which also functions somewhat as a mini-retrospective of other classic Davis pieces \u2013 features Davis\u2019s self-described \u201cinvestigation into a kind of denial of the physical reality of the medium\u2026[putting] the control over the medium\u2026back into the hands of the human imagination.\u201d Likewise, it directly contradicts VIDEODROME\u2019s association of television and sexuality with pain and control.
