When the New York Islanders first burst on the national hockey scene, the team was unstoppable. Winning four straight Stanley Cups, it became the pride of Long Island, until subsequent years of turmoil left the Islanders in dire straits. Enter John Spano, an obscure Texas millionaire with big dreams and a persuasive smile.  Director and avid Islanders fan Kevin Connolly of HBO\u2019s Entourage gets an earnest play-by-play from a man who exaggerated his social and monetary profile so vastly that he actually took control of an NHL franchise. With testimony from sports analysts and federal investigators, Connolly skillfully pieces together this unbelievable story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oQE0WcczetL3RKlOODEhXvTnhOF.jpg", "actors": ["John Spano ()", "Clark Gillies ()", "Bob Nystrom ()", "Wayne Gretzky ()", "Gary Bettman ()", "Bryan Berard ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
