Largely composed of 'actualities' of his family, Birdseye's formerly private films nonetheless demonstrate enterprising use of experimental photographic techniques, including double exposure and slow motion; as well as playful, hand-drawn/written title cards.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
