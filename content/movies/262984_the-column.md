He places a Roman centurion in his place to occupy his latest conquest. After lopping off the head of the Dacian warlord, the soldier uses his blood-stained hands to dine on cheese and bread, unable to suppress his laughter. The centurion has a change of heart when he is put in charge of the region, freely dispensing justice and forgiveness to the conquered inhabitants. When the peace is threatened by marauding barbarians in masks of fur, the locals help the Romans fend off the invasion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vUnzTO9Sbo0DXoRnKlRPZGgZcdQ.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Johnson (comandantul roman Tiberius)", "Antonella Lualdi (Andrada, nobil\u0103 dac\u0103)", "Ilarion Ciobanu (Gerula, c\u0103petenie dac\u0103)", "Stefan Ciubotarasu (Ciungu, c\u0103petenie dac\u0103)", "Amedeo Nazzari (\u00eemp\u0103ratul Traian)", "Amza Pellea (regele dac Decebal)", "Emil Botta (Marele Preot al dacilor)", "Franco Interlenghi (centurionul Optimus)", "Gheorghe Dinic\u0103 (Bastus)", "Sidonia Manolache (Zia)", "Maria Cupcea (Prisosta, mama lui Bastus)", "Florin Piersic (Sabinus)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
