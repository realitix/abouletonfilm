Instead of starring a mysterious woman, the film stars a mysterious gray cat. The film is an unconventional narrative built around an afternoon catnap and blurs the lines between reality and dreams. With a hint of horror and a tone of suspense, this film pays homage to an avant-garde masterpiece of film history and offers a whimsical take on the feline enigma. Meows of the Afternoon is an inherently humorous re-imagining of an art film classic.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
