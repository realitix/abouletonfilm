Way too often. One night, flying sperm escape and impregnate local women. The babies grow into an army of little creatures with the teen's head -- and libido. Not only do the nasty little monsters think only of chicks and jerking off, they also have a distressing tendency to die at the moment of ejaculation. The city really starts to panic when aliens accidentally turn one of the spawn into a giant.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uzeD3o0akb17jly5bVYjRxnaEN.jpg", "actors": ["Leo Putt (Sutin)", "Pimpaporn Leenutapong (Laem-Mee)", "Nattawat Srimawk (Prasert)", "Chakrapong Siririn (Surachai)", "Tanwarin Sukkhapisit (Anant)", "Somlek Sakdikul (Dr. Satifeung)", "Dollaros Dachapratumwan (Sister Doctor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Csi2AqUc9eI"}
