Can a one-sided dialouge breaks the walls and expresses the man\u2019s feelings and sentiments? Or does the lover or the country wants the wall to be broken in the first place?  This short was inspired by Amy Len\u2019s dance choreography \u201cWall\u201d and colloborated with Loh Bok Lai. The dance was originally choreographed for a performance in Japan Dance Wave Fukuoka \u201806 - Asian Contemporary Dance Now and later made into an experimental video combining elements of an actor and monologue. The video footages were also used for the dance piece itself in KL.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iQJOVK47iiZVsfwYByzphRbNao2.jpg", "actors": ["Amy Len ()", "Bok Lai Loh ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "PoJvCGhP4qk"}
