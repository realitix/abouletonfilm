The film has aesthetic shades of Mark Leckey's Turner prize-winning 'Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore' or the black sense of humour in the classic 1st series of the Chris Morris-produced 'Look Around You', but 'MisinforMation' is more subtly febrile, lucidly reflecting the effective slow infection of a nation's psyche present in the original films. A prized Hauntological document, but also a strangely alluring and oddly beautiful document of a bygone era we just cant seem to let go of.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dDZTb9Y2E1zZoNXgQCS2fprb92i.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
