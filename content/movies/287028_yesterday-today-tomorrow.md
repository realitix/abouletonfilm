From a rat infestation in the slums, a fast-spreading virus grips Hong Kong, inducing panic when the government is slow to react. Mercilessly cut down by censors for its frank portrayal of class and political conflicts at the time of its release, the film found new critical acclaim in during the SARS outbreak decades later. In 2011, it was placed on Hong Kong Film Archive\u2019s list of the 100 must-see Hong Kong films of all time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s4nMiWVCnGjuXVl05JvdVZhY12T.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Chang Chung ()", "Yang Chang ()", "Nancy Sit Ka-Yin ()", "Kenneth Tsang ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
