The disease has exaggerated Toms nervous energy and in his manic state he suddenly decides to go to Glasgow to visit the family he hasn't seen in ten years. His brother Ian is thoroughly disgusted by his lifestyle and only his mother shows any compassion for him. The visit soon develops into a nightmare as dementia sets in and Tom's health rapidly declines. Finally, events come to a head and Ira has no choice but to force Tom back to London, where he expects him to die at any time. After treatment, Tom gets a brief reprieve, having discovered that his real family is his adopted one in London.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dXjjchkahHkZFtWQHxqBMy8P4B3.jpg", "actors": ["Alfred Molina ()", "Cal Macaninch ()", "John McGlynn ()", "Siobhan Redmond ()", "Annette Crosbie ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
