Set during the Meiji period (1868-1912), Kaede (Sayuri Yoshinaga) is the former mistress of a wealthy merchant. When he dies, she is forced out on the street and forced to give up her young daughter to the merchant's family. The film opens with her working in a high-class brothel abutting Tokyo Bay. Though she has passionate affection for a drug wholesaler, whom she loves as well, Kaede is swamped with not only debts to the bordello and family obligations -- she is expected to support her parents and her sister -- but also guilt over losing her child. This pain is only increased when Kaede learns that her daughter is being abused. She does the only thing she can: She buys back her child by signing on at the brothel for a longer stint.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9D7fADE8t0pbVYUFSAZ0w73ywhu.jpg", "actors": ["Sayuri Yoshinaga (Onami)", "Kyoko Kataoka (Kaede)", "Kirin Kiki (Omatsu)", "Toshiyuki Nagashima (Odabe)", "Hiroyuki Nagato ()", "Sumie Sasaki (Osawa)", "Sh\u00f4ji Yasui ()", "Touta Tarumi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
