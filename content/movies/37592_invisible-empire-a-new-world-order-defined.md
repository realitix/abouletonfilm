The film traces the lineage of the evolution of global governance from Samuel Zane Batten\u2019s 1919 manifesto New World Order, through to Hitler\u2019s vision of a 1000 year Reich, to the modern incarnation of the conspiracy which has its roots in the evil deeds of people like George H. W. Bush, David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zz4QEeyFy7nOiZ7bs9iyDYLx3KC.jpg", "actors": ["Jason Bermas (Narrator)", "Mark Dice (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [36715, 59125, 34319, 86694], "youtube_key": "q6VyOlIcRJs"}
