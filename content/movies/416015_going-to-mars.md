Then there is Chun-hee in Seoul, 2009, living with the eyes of the missing girl. With some help (?) from her father Chun-hee\u2018s corneas were donated to her in 1991. Yet corneas donation must happen postmortem, a gift coming from somebody\u2019s death. Today Chun-hee works at a real estate agency, showing houses and lands for development. One day she is given the task of introducing lands in Hwaseong, a misfortunate place of past but being developed into a high-tech industrial city now.
