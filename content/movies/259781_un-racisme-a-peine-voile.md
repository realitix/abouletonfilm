What follows is a deafening political and media debate, justifying in most cases the exclusion of girls wearing head-scarves to school.  February 2004, a law was eventually passed by the National Assembly. \"A thinly veiled racism\" is about this controversy since the affair of Creil in 1989 (where two schoolgirls were excluded for the same reasons) and attempts to \"reveal\" that maybe what hides behind is the desire to exclude these girls. This film gives them a voice as well as others - teachers, community activists, feminists, researchers - gathered around the group \"A School for You-All\" fighting for the repeal of this law they consider sexist and racist ...  This movie was censured in Septembre 2004 in France.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/maxpvabrAabO4hwiVslxQszexAu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "FjA3PX-qmOQ"}
