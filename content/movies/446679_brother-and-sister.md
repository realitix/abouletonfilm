It was popular enough in France to be re-released after its initial run and had to be cut by 3 1/2 minutes in Australia to secure an R rating to remove 'indecency.' To date, the film has yet to receive a home video release.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p7yuOdChy0RxjWFfHovDkmAVtdh.jpg", "actors": ["Rene Bond ()", "Con Covert ()", "Sandy Dempsey ()", "Lawrence Edwards ()", "Jacqueline Giroux ((as Robyn Whitting))", "Marsha Jordan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
