This time, their collaboration sparks again as the film seamlessly brings three short stories together through three different segments of flashbacks. Yin Zhaozong (Bao Fong) is an amour fou falling in love with a girl much younger than him. Instead, Yu Baicheng (Fu Che) is a playboy trapped by his three girlfriends. The bartender (Chiao Chuang), however, tells them how he and his wife are blessed by true love. The film not only displays Li's sensitivity to narrative structure but also his ability to cast the most suited actors for their respective roles, as such Mao Mei had a chance to demonstrate her dance talent for her debut in this movie.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Fu Che ()", "Hsia Moon ()", "Bao Fong ()", "Mao Mei ()", "Chuang Chiao ()", "Betty Loh Tih ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
