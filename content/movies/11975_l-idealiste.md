Jon Voight plays the lead lawyer for the insurance company and Roy Scheider the CEO of the corporation.\r\n\r\nBeyond Coppola\u2019s renowned expertise, the cast is stellar, which also includes Mickey Rourke as a smooth legal mogul, Virginia Madsen as a witness and Dean Stockwell & Danny Glover as judges. This was Damon\u2019s break out role as a leading man, paving the way for hits like \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d (1998) and \u201cSaving Private Ryan\u201d (1998). He\u2019s affable as the principled young lawyer and I liked the way the movie discreetly shows his new home life with the elderly lady, plus other budding relationships.\r\n\r\nThis is decidedly a drama with many courtroom scenes, so don\u2019t except the thrills of other Grisham-based films, like the excellent \u201cThe Firm\u201d (1993) and action-packed \u201cThe Pelican Brief\u201d (1993), although there is an intense action sequence in the second half. While the first half confidently take its time with the drama, throwing in moments of realistic amusement, it segues into a compelling third act. Furthermore, \u201cThe Rainmaker\u201d is a must for anyone interested in the good, the bad and the ugly of the legal arena in America.\r\n\r\nThe movie made $46 million domestically from a budget of $40 million (not including revenue from other countries), but it was still considered a disappoint in comparison to \u201cThe Firm,\u201d which cost roughly the same amount and made six times as much at the box office. Coppola subsequently took a decade break from directing before reentering the fray with the inscrutable \u201cYouth Without Youth\u201d (2007).\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 15 minutes and was shot in the Memphis area of Tennessee, as well as Cleveland, Ohio and California (Alameda, Oakland, San Francisco).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"}], "recommandations_id": [9944, 37233, 10731, 10684]}
