This concert was shot in a widescreen format and recorded in 5.1 Surround to provide an electrifying home viewing experience. Next to actually attending a Fountains show, as any fan will tell you, there's No Better Place to see them. Bonus features: all-new, never-before-seen acoustic performances of songs from their 2007 album, Traffic and Weather, and more.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kBMXtxFeSldB69IQLoGcq1BRzQh.jpg", "actors": ["Adam Schlesinger (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
