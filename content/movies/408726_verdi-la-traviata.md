Her Violetta Val\u00e9ry is a vulnerable figure torn between self-indulgence and love, sacrificing personal happiness to become a victim of the social mores of mid-19th-century bourgeois France. Fleming's acting captures the complexity of the character and her vocalism is flawless. She negotiates the wild coloratura of Act One with aplomb, and is stunning in the lyric passages that pervade the opera, and touching in her scenes with her lover, Alfredo, and his father.  She's blessed with Rolando Villaz\u00f3n as Alfredo. He brings fiery passion to the role of the impetuous lover, convincing in his anger at what he thinks is her betrayal, and in his regrets in their last-act deathbed reconciliation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vbbBbSyExISujRe75mHGRu9jBjC.jpg", "actors": ["Ren\u00e9e Fleming (Violetta)", "Rolando Villaz\u00f3n (Alfredo)", "Renato Bruson (Giorgio Germont)", "Suzanna Guzm\u00e1n (Flora Bervoix)", "Daniel Montenegro (Gastone)", "Anna Alkhimova (Annina)", "Philip Kraus (Bar\u00f3n Douphol)", "James Creswell (Doctor Grenvil)", "Lee Poulis (Marqu\u00e9s D'Obigny)", "Sal Malaki (Giuseppe)", "James Conlon (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
