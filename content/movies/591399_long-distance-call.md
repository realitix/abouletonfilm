Finally, a call. His wife Claire is on the other side of the world on a beach at a luxury resort, drunk, also in the dark, but apparently with another man. An adulterous affair, or a life in danger? In the harrowing wait and frantic calls that follow, is it his marriage, his wife or his sanity that is most under threat? The telephone line is the single fragile thread that connects them. All Henry can do is to hang onto that phone.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bsbwprBAnpYQHdd0LwbeckUTWfK.jpg", "actors": ["Arno Frisch (Henry)", "Eva Bay (Claire (voice))", "Milek Knebel (Dr. Hatami (voice))", "Nikolai Kinski (Rezeptionist (voice))", "Lenio Amory Einbeck (Lenn)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
