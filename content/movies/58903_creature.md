The film did make me laugh with how the doors sound in the film, the doors sounds like blaster firing from Star Wars so I thought that was definitely funny in a good way.\r\n\r\nHowever I did find two problems with this film, the first problem I found was that the Alien creature was very under-used, it didn't really appear much until the final act of the film so that was a wasted opportunity. The second problem is that the story and some scenes were a bit ropey, and there's some things I find a bit baffling in it but not to the point of being obnoxious.\r\n\r\nEven though people have discarded this film just because it's a low budget Alien clone but I say give it a chance because it's really not that bad."}], "recommandations_id": [39195, 34094, 58803, 83329], "youtube_key": "N2ZHZyj8vrU"}
