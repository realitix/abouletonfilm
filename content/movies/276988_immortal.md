Deep in the DNA of a humble pond creature an Australian-born scientist co-discovered an 'immortalising' enzyme, a chemical catalyst that can keep cells young, forever. In 2009 this discovery was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine. But, this is no simple 'cure' for ageing. For the same enzyme that fuels endless youth, also fuels cancer. Immortal reveals the inner workings of this biological paradox and its remarkable impact on ageing, stress, disease and cancer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/20xxkxbK8OOKqnDNYlbYTXvWXm6.jpg", "actors": ["Rachael Blake (Herself - Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
