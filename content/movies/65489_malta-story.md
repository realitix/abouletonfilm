The Axis also wanted it for their own supply lines. Plenty of realistic reenactments and archival combat footage as the British are beseiged and try to fight off the Luftwaffe. Against this background, a RAF reconnaissance photographer's romance with a local girl is endangered as he tries to plot enemy movements.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wacjTVEvZrYMST5FJ7jT0of2GiI.jpg", "actors": ["Alec Guinness (Flight Lt.
