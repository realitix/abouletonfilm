All the gritty footage was recorded by prisoners in their cells using a video camera that was smuggled into the facility. The result is a bloody, often brutal insider's view of life behind bars.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
