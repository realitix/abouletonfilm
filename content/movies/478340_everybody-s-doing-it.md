He is a confirmed old bachelor and very much disturbed when he finds the cook, the maid and his typewriter all making love to his chauffeur, the policeman and the clerk. A stroll through the park brings him in contact with young lovers, who are entirely unconscious of his presence. Grace Williams, a mischievous young girl, seeing his disgust, flirts with him and he becomes very much interested in her. After several meetings with her, Cupid shoots his dart into his crusty heart.
