It was a film about American music, about three pieces of three LPs. There was a song by Van Morrison, another by Harvey Mandel, and one of Credence Clearwater Revival. It was mainly the music and some shots out of a car, landscapes out of the car window. And it had a little bit of commentary \u2013 dialogue between Peter and me about American music and about how American rock music was about emotion and images instead of sounds. That is to say, about a kind of phenomenon, that it was in a way a kind of film music, but without a moving picture. It was a 12-minute film and it was never shown. \u2013 Wim Wenders", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8iWHCRSgl3NWK3tOTo9cCoRyDqo.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Handke ()", "Wim Wenders ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
