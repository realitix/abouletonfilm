Though she was tortured and eventually executed by the Nazis, her diaries indicate that she was optimistic for the humanity of her captors and did not by any means hate them. Told with simple dignity, this film makes clear why Maruska became a national hero.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4Ud6xBcGoSmFOMc23lxrOKqvOd2.jpg", "actors": ["Magda V\u00e1\u0161\u00e1ryov\u00e1  (Maru\u0161ka Kude\u0159\u00edkov\u00e1)", "J\u00falius Va\u0161ek (Father)", "Viera Strniskov\u00e1 (Mother)", "Hana Pastej\u0159\u00edkov\u00e1 (Jarka)", "Dagmar Bl\u00e1hov\u00e1 (Julinka)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
