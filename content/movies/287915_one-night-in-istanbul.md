Hoping to use the trip as a chance to bond with their sons, big trouble awaits them in the form of a sexy hotel chambermaid, two ruthless crooks on a mission and a bag of counterfeit cash.  It is 3-0 down at half time and things could not be more desperate both on and off the pitch. Stevie G and the boys in red are trying to launch the most amazing football comeback in history, and Tommy is in deep water, being held hostage. With the clock ticking and time running out, a miracle is needed fast. In the end a bit of faith, and Gerry\u2019s lucky underpants may be the only thing that can get them and the cup back home in one piece.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jSDwGPMa7g5A4HkwXKmDnJM4RoP.jpg", "actors": ["Steven Waddington (Tommy)", "Lucien Laviscount (Joseph)", "Paul Barber (Gerry)", "Samantha Womack (Carmella Jones)", "Ingvar Eggert Sigur\u00f0sson (Altan)", "Mark Womack (Tony Fitz)", "Terry O'Neill (Old Kopite)", "Nicky Allt (Yoda)", "Erkan Kolcak Kostendil (Undercover Cop)", "\u00d6zcan \u00d6zdemir (Driver)", "Marc Hughes (Jamie)", "Ryan Muldoon (Irate Fan)", "Ay\u00e7in Inci (Female Commander)", "Mia Carragher (Blue Kid)", "Tage Herstad (Fan)", "Sarah Donovan (Undercover police woman)", "Faith Ugurlu (Policeman)", "Antonio Bustorff (Thief)", "Sedat Mert (Ismail)", "Gemze Seber (Leyla)", "Ayhan Ero\u011flu (Hakan)", "Nathan Capper (Red Kid)", "Connor Ross (Cheeky Kid 1)", "Ahmet Gencehan G\u00fcnes (Highway Police 1)", "Munk Erbil Erdenebat (Malaysian Fan)", "Cemil Ezdin (Chef)", "Yilmaz Ozt\u00fcrk (Highway Police 2)", "Ali Kemal Mutlu (Angry Man 1)", "Savas G\u00fclbahar (Toothless Guy)", "Ste Dwyer (Undercover police man)", "Karen Oliver (Barmaid)", "Ali Basar Kurtoglu (Turkish Hustler)", "Mustafa Adig\u00fczel (Tout)", "Kartal Ugur (Milan Fan)", "James Baron (Norwegian Fan)", "Joe Allt (Young Tommy)", "Omer Utkan Sencer (Barmen)", "Thomas Daniel Gokan (Chewie)", "M\u00fcmin Albayrak (Angry Man 2)", "Sadi Aymutlu (Shady Shop Owner)", "Jeff List (Jabba)", "Daniel Marquand (Cheeky Kid 2)", "Muhsun Baraner (Kebab Delivery Guy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "F8dKDs3xNSs"}
