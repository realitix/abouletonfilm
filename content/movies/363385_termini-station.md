The film stars Colleen Dewhurst and Megan Follows as Molly and Micheline Dushane, a mother and daughter living in a small Northern Ontario town.  Molly is an alcoholic, which creates tension between her and Micheline and inspires Micheline's fantasies of escaping her stifling small-town life.  The cast also includes Gordon Clapp and Debra McGrath as Molly's son and daughter-in-law.  Termini Station was the only film besides the Anne of Green Gables movies in which Follows and Dewhurst worked together.
