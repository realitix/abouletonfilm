Despite her intentions to stay alone, however, Naomi quickly makes two unexpected connections- one with a musically gifted Ultra-Orthodox young boy who lives in her building and the other, with Fabrizio, a charismatic Italian monk and organist. While these relationships allow Naomi to reconnect with her love of music and sense of meaning, they also make her a target in her new community. Faced with escalating isolation and violence, Naomi must learn to use music as a bridge to overcome towering religious barriers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1zFMsT8Z7pzqdfTjuu8tw8NXUQ5.jpg", "actors": ["Ania Bukstein (Naomi)", "Uri Gottlieb (Traffic Inspector)", "Giorgio Lupano (Fabrizio)", "Ludi Boeken ()", "Rona-Lee Shim'on ()", "Irit Kaplan ()", "Yoav Levi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
