As Paul Schrader notes, \"it is probably quite impossible (and useless) to make a distinction between the point at which the film reflects their lives, and the point at which their lives reflect the film.\" \"Brandy in the Wilderness\" remains a little-known yet key work of American indie filmmaking.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f6gMweOe7LPJypg95EgdUrjBdgU.jpg", "actors": ["Stanton Kaye ()", "Michaux Frenc ()", "Allan McCollum ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
