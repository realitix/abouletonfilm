It was not the reason for purchasing the set but surprisingly, a good film with entertainment value and historical context. Roger Kern and Linda Purl lead the cast, playing the role of a young couple who aspire to establish themselves on a plot in the Dakotas. The couple face challenges along the way but demonstrate strength and determination to overcome all odds. Don't expect academy award-winning performances or breathtaking cinematography when you watch this gem. This is a a feel good movie that is family-friendly and a pleasure to watch"}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
