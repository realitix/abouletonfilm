(This was the term used by American cinema exhibitors in the 1940s and earlier for any movie with an all-black cast, intended primarily for distribution in black neighbourhoods at a time when many American cinemas were segregated.) The song-and-dance performer here is none other than the great Bill Robinson.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hpSS6SxKZGgtps14z7s4BWsDyV4.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Robinson (HImself)", "Jeanne Bayer (Bar-room Patron)", "Deanie Gordon (Patron in Bar-room)", "Winnie Johnson (Patron)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "RRo-aC1pggg"}
