Today, the saccharine charm of these anti-modern fairy tales doesn\u2019t work any more. But undistracted by the meaning or action of the film, we can enjoy the surface of Prunella all the better, the dazzling sets and costumes, silhouettes and painted backdrops created by the great art director Ben Carr\u00e9 in a fashionable Art D\u00e9co Neo-Rococo style.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Isabel Berwin (Prin)", "Marguerite Clark (Prunella)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
