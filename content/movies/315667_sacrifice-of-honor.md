The first half of the film takes place aboard a French cruising ship, steaming through dangerous waters during WWI. Among the passengers is heroine Jeanne (Annabella), who was once in love with first-officer D'Artelles (Robert Vidalin) but he now seems strangely preoccupied. It turns out that the ship is on a secret mission, which ultimately dooms the vessel to a Lusitania-like death. After the sinking, Captain De Corlaix (Victor Francen) faces a court-martial, and it is at this point that the film clarifies several baffling plot points. Despite its complexity, the story is fairly believable, with the exception of the grafted-on romantic subplot.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u99bGtyqSnNLBkwotgqLYnE6eTp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
