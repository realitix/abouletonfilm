In this musical tour-de-funk, we meet The Beasties, a clan of humans who have recently evolved from primates, and The Blesseds, a self-righteous religious sect who descended directly from Adam and Eve. When a brutal slaying provokes the Beasties to attack the Blesseds, all hell breaks loose and an unlikely romance throws a monkey wrench into the whole musical mess.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jy66YhjJKELoULEL2QjYbR1LlkE.jpg", "actors": ["Tonya Glanz (Mary Catheter)", "Andrew Bancroft (Wog Wog)", "Jon Wolanske (Father Catheter)", "Melanie Case (Queen Bonobo)", "Shaye Troha (Mother Grizzard)", "Paco Romane (Flippy)", "Sean Hayes (Jesus H.
