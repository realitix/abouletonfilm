As the mighty Sith army spreads across the galaxy, subjugating every planet in its path, all the people of Prias can do is wait, their world protected by an energy shield held in place by ancient towers. While the people wait in fear, one Jedi trained by Master Oram Bren will be chosen to be the future leader of Prias, a title decided by a vote of the entire population of the planet. But little do they know that one Jedi's dark secret could spell their doom.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l2tNXcXJRf9A2mYQCXnjenpjQon.jpg", "actors": ["Carlos Acu\u00f1a (Eidolon)", "Maureen Isern (Alana)", "Jason Updike (Erik)", "Kevin Walsh (Orem Bren)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "K-De5s8JzJY"}
