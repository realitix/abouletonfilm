Actually, they are attempting to avoid the draft but when their plane, the Buzzard, fails miserably, they march off to war. Richard Fiske, formerly a busy supporting player in Stooges comedies, appeared in this two-reeler courtesy of stock footage from the earlier Boobs in Arms (1940). Ironically, Fiske had himself been drafted and would be killed in action in France in August of 1944.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Curly Howard (Curly Wrong)", "Larry Fine (Larry Wrong)", "Moe Howard (Moe Wrong)", "Richard Fiske (The Sargent)", "Bobby Barber (Private (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
