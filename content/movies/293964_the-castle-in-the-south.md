This may not be among Bolvary's major works, but the story of a prince (Victor de Kowa) who substitutes for an actor playing a prince in a film without anyone knowing that he's a prince, which in the following leads to a plot in which the prince pretends to be a prince until someone reveals that he isn't a prince even though he is a prince\u2026 ahm\u2026 I know it's confusing\u2026 well, this story is entertaining indeed, and of course leads to some amorous troubles.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ty6NfsWMu28r6JeEbkZIrXgDARs.jpg", "actors": ["Liane Haid (Maria Foreni)", "Viktor de Kowa (Mirano)", "Paul Kemp (Ottoni)", "Erik Ode (Tonio)", "Paul Westermeier (Deri)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
