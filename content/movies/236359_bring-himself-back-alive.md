He does his best to kill any animal he can for the sport of it, for furs, etc. Skinner is out to trap an egotistical lion, who struts along with scat-like banter. Hyde Skinner sets a trap for the lion, and corners him in a cave. He tries to force him out with a lit stick of dynamite, which the lion pushes back at Skinner. Skinner backs up, stepping into his own trap with the fuse on the dynamite burning. He grabs the turtle, and writes a message for help on his chest, then begs the turtle to hurry. The poor turtle does his best to run, but in slow motion, as the dynamite fuse continues to burn down. While still running along, the dynamite explodes off camera, and the turtle stands up and wipes the message off his chest.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
