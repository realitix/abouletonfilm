Unable to write enough to keep his publisher's royalty advances coming, he seeks out a woman he imagines is a prostitute and interviews her for material. He is also inspired to utter some poetry, which his brassy, outspoken wife identifies as coming from the famous homosexuality-advocating mystical German poet, Stefan George. This inspires Walter to take a closer look at the gay scene, and he quickly becomes a sort of celebrity there.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5qb3S94BNtnhLQQtkNR5XvoGGHM.jpg", "actors": ["Kurt Raab (Walter Kranz)", "Margit Carstensen (Andree)", "Helen Vita (Luise Kranz)", "Volker Spengler (Ernst Kranz)", "Ingrid Caven (Lisa)", "Ulli Lommel (Polizist Lauf)", "Brigitte Mira (Walters Mutter)", "Marquard Bohm (Rolf, Lillys Mann)", "Christiane Maybach (Vertreterin)", "Nino Korda (Bankangestellter)", "Adrian Hoven (Arzt)", "Armin Meier (Stricher)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [189941, 228695, 189995, 190280], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
