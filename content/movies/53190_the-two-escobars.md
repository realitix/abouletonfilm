It's very well made and is entirely narrated by the people being interviewed which gives it a very authentic feel. \r\n\r\nEven if you're not into sports, the political aspects of this documentary make for a very interesting perspective. It's more about what Columbia as a nation was going through rather than about drugs or sports.\r\n\r\nFor anyone who wants to learn more about this period of history, I highly recommend The Two Escobars."}], "recommandations_id": [54683, 54677, 54741, 67857]}
