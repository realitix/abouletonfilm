He dumps his hand into the river, which floats to a nearby spot where squash grows from the ground. The young man's blood seeps into the squash, thus bringing it to life.  Meanwhile, a man looking for Thanksgiving dinner for him and his wife encounters the sentient, murderous squash. Will the squash become his dinner? Or will the man become dinner himself?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lLAWQYmFJ3nZ6mZ4k2SXx37izwh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
