Dejected, he wanders off on a mountain trail to cry. A wolf spots him, and begins stalking but the braying, even more hideous when mixed with sobs, chases him off. The wolf spots easier prey: the same cute critters that rejected our hero earlier. He corners a baby gopher, and is closing in, when the burro arrives and brays him right into a rock and off a cliff. The creatures decide to embrace the burro and to tie his ears around his mouth to silence him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/85l1q1E7BVCNGDMkqU2eyFqC7Dr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
