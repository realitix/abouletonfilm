Being angry with the Laodicean church, the Lord reproaches: \u201cI know your deeds; you are neither cold nor hot. \u201d Cold, that is, a sinner who denies or arguing with God, is not hopeless, he can come to salvation through repentance, but a warm, spiritually smoldering person who does not believe in ritual following his heart - such a person is against God. Punk is always a choice of two extremes. Or drink till you drop - or become an invete sober person. Hot or cold. But never warm. The heroes of the film are three generations of Russian punks - from \u201cAutomatic Satisfiers\u201d to \u201cPornofilm\u201d.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bnNmugdeiljU8SYsd4EEEIN56ak.jpg", "actors": ["Vladimir Kotlyarov (himself)", "Alexey Siyatelev (himself)", "Inna Medvedun (herself)", "Dmitry Spirin (himself)", "Evgeny Yufit (himself)", "Igor Gudkov (himself)", "Liya Panova (herself)", "Ekaterina Panova (herself)", "Valery Panov (himself)", "Olga Slobodskaya (herself)", "Fedor Lavrov (himself)", "Aleksandr Ilin (himself)", "Sergey Erzhenkov (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
