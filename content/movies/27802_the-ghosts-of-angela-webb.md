Psychics Alexander Stewart and Bernadette Fieldstone are contacted to try to uncover the secrets hidden within her home. What they experience is more than a mere haunting. They come to understand that reality is far more horrifying than fiction. What makes this ghost story unique is that it is based on a true story. In 2001 the two psychics investigated an old western New Jersey farmhouse. So powerful were the images they captured on film, a British television production company met with Angela Webb to do a television special at her house! The story IS factual; the conclusion is shocking.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lC0IPqKDCpPgZgD8deX3Zgv12pb.jpg", "actors": ["Deana Enoches (Angela Webb)", "Debbie D (Ghost)", "Michael R.
