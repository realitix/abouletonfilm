The idea is that two couples come on the show and compete for cash and fabulous prizes.  So what\u2019s the thrill? Well, they compete by answering questions about sex and by demonstrating their sexual skills for the appreciative crowd.  The female contestants on this show seem to have been selected on the basis of their top-heavy figures, as each of them sports some truly enormous up-top assets. The premise is cute enough, and the flick eatures some funny moments. But what the film specializes in is white-hot action. The couples are led through their paces by a host of hot-to-trot temptresses, each one bustier than the last. And once the action get going, there\u2019s no way to stop it until it reaches its inevitable and explosive climax. Buxom beauty Candie Evans is at the peak of her considerable on-screen prowess here, while ebony stunner Ebony Ayes provides more than her fair share of jolting jiggle.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Candie Evans ()", "Regine Bardot ()", "Beverly Glen ()", "Ebony Ayes ()", "Rick Savage ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
