The mountain folk are depicted as superstitious, blood-thirsty primitives, which struck traditionally discriminated-against locals and others in their community as discriminatory. Probably as a result, the film has been seldom screened in Japan, and contrary to some speculation, it has never been officially banned.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pKtL9POXw3isIR6eUZCQeYOSCou.jpg", "actors": ["Bunta Sugawara (Masayuki Abe)", "Namiji Namiura (Azami)", "Y\u00f4ko Mihara (Mieko Suzuki)", "Y\u00f4ichi Numata ()", "Den Kunikata ()", "Ky\u00f4ko Yashiro (Kanako Oikawa)", "Torahiko Nakamura ()", "Arata Shibata ()", "Ky\u00f4ji Kokonoe ()", "Rei Ishikawa ()", "Jotaro Yuki ()", "Shinji Suzuki (Fujikura)", "Katsuya Uda (Heisaku)", "Satoshi Komori (Genzo)", "Fujie Satsuki (Old woman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "-KZRNv3SxYY"}
