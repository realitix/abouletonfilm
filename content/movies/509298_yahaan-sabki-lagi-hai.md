The film looks at the way we so casually live in a class system built on blatant economic and social disparities, the way we so want to be fooled by our belief systems. By exploring a counter-point for every point, the film subtly questions not only our material value system but also our emotional value system. The plot revolves around a road trip gone wrong. The idea was to keep the seriousness of the situation but present it in a humorous manner with characters, plots, and nuances that are realistic but at the same quirky and humorous, leaving the audience with a feel-good buzz.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5Vb4GRX8PNFgbUPsB4kvo8OWr7P.jpg", "actors": ["Varun Thakur (Bharat)", "Yoshika Verma (Anamika)", "Teeshay Shah (Shanti)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "IKBDC8SlLWc"}
