Sephora Woldu plays \"Sephora\" who, like the director, is an architecture student but also a filmmaker. She is pitching to her traditional mother a film she wants to make about a man who fled their home country and ended up in San Francisco. As a recently arrived immigrant, he is terribly homesick for his native Eritrea, but will not admit it due to unease towards speaking ill of the country; and more consciously in hesitance of admitting hard truths about his culture and himself. \"It\u2019s colorful and visually whimsical in a way that can only be described as if the Wizard of Oz went to Africa,\" said Woldu.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tfmNpQWl1IAaNnjrEmhktPzs8cu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
