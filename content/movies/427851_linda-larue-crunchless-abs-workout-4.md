However, recent research shows that standard floor crunches train only 2 of these critically important core muscles.  Developed by noted fitness expert Linda LaRue, her unique exercise method focuses on each core muscle like a laser, targeting your upper abs, those hard to reach deep lower abs, your left and right side obliques, and wrapping all the way around to your lower back.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
