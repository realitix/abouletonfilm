Each episode finds them providing hilarious commentary on a variety of B-movie horror films - some of which are terrifying! Their number one fan, a precocious 11-year-old named Jamie, never misses an episode. With her parents out for the evening, Jamie sits down in front of the tube to devour the delectable terror, but her favorite Friday night freak show is constantly interrupted by her annoying new babysitter, Tina. If they can survive each other, they may be able to survive the night!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oYwG6YPF2S4psiD6pUSvAXFvVFp.jpg", "actors": ["Ellie Church (The Widow)", "Adam Michaels (Charlie)", "Elizabeth Stenholt (Tina)", "Leigh Rose (Grandma O'Malley)", "Alaina Kramer (Jamie)", "Lia Sullivan (Kacey)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "FL0GBY6FvSo"}
