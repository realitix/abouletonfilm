This audacious cinematic collage offers both a unique snapshot of a single day in the life of Dublin and a vivid example of a bold guerrilla filmmaking model. The film is an eclectic, multi-authored impression of Dublin (within the bounds of the encircling M50 motorway) as it lived, died, breathed, made love, filled up and emptied, consumed, wept, was rained and shone upon, grew bright and then darkened again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8cAHen8c2NSczNcAujHDckDvNJn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
