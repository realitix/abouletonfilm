On the one hand through the objects in the picture - male statues, a woman approaching, on the other hand, through surface tension in the images, opposing textures, hardness ratios, convex and concave shapes, the color that keeps the film flowing, the objects related to each other, concentrates and loses, and the music is very important which comes from an old American musical and has a narrative dimension. \" (Christine Noll Brinckmann)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/74tuwI9xa6RW1X0tjWwVE1Bi2Ze.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
