After an absence from the live stage for 28 years, this headline set by Jeff Lynne's ELO was a much-anticipated and talked-about event. In front of 50,000 people, Jeff Lynne delivered a rousing and crowd-pleasing string of the Electric Light Orchestra's chart-topping hits, including Livin' Thing, Sweet Talkin' Woman, Don't Bring Me Down, Mr Blue Sky, and Roll Over Beethoven. And there was also Jeff's touching tribute to his band buddies from Traveling Wilburys, in his performance of their 1988 hit Handle With Care.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/BxsKs9jNNNIP8gdZfhUQUrdZOe.jpg", "actors": ["Jeff Lynne (Himself - Lead vocals, Guitars)", "Richard Tandy (Himself - Keyboards, Synthesisers, Backing Vocals)", "Chereene Allen (Herself - Violin)", "Marcus Byrne (Himself - Keyboards)", "Donavan Hepburn (Himself - Drums)", "Iain Hornal (Himself - Backing Vocals, Guitar)", "Melanie Lewis-McDonald (Herself - Backing Vocals)", "Danny Marsden (Himself - Trumpet)", "Milton McDonald (Himself - Guitar, Vocals)", "Lee Pomeroy (Himself - Bass)", "Bernie Smith (Himself - Keyboards)", "Mike Stevens (Himself - Guitar, Vocals)", "Mickey Wilson (Himself - Percussion, Vocals)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "LMY5xe36cfE"}
