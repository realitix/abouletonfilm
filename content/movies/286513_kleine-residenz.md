Everybody is celebrating the 600th birthday of the local hero, Otto the Ironman, who in his time saved the duchy from annexation and beat the enemy so badly, that he fled ... well, that\u2019s what it says in the history books, at least.  Local gossip asserts, however, that Otto wasn\u2019t even part of the battle and was spending his time having fun with a pretty girl.  When one day a piece is introduced at the court theatre, which tells the heroic story of Otto, the director rejects the mediocre story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hffqJwPdXoI5ARXWjOd1z5EiZDk.jpg", "actors": ["Lil Dagover (Herzogin von Lauffenburg)", "Johannes Riemann (Freiherr von Luck)", "Winnie Markus (Marianne Hartung)", "Fritz Odemar (Herzog von Lauffenburg)", "Gustav Waldau (Professor Schmittchen)", "Margarete Haagen (Tante der Herzogin)", "Ulrich Beiger (M\u00f6ller)", "Carl Wery (Dr. Werner)", "Walter Buhse (Fresco)", "Willem Holsboer (Lampe)", "Wastl Witt (Frimmel)", "Werner Nippen (Mattes)", "Josef Eichheim (Inspizient)", "Otto Br\u00fcggemann (Flemming)", "Paul Wagner (Pfundhammer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
