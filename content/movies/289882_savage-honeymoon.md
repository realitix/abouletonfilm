Mickey is filling the garage with  stolen goods - again, and pierced teenage daughter, Leesa, is an accident waiting to happen  on the family's beloved Triumph motorbike. An unconventional tough family, battling to survive  with humour and love, in a world of motor bikes, rock 'n' roll, classic cars and alcohol.
