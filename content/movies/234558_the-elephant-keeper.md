As the move to scythe down whole forests progresses, there is less and less use for these elephants: heavy machinery works more efficiently in a clear-cutting situation. In this story, a young elephant keeper (Sorapong Chatri) manages to save the life of a forest ranger, dedicated to keeping the (very few) national forest preserves safe from poaching. The elephant-keeper, on the other hand, is economically compelled to work for the poachers in order to keep his family fed, and to preserve the family lands from sale by a greedy businessman who once loaned them money.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xLFAvVFh6TcUb9fsfFoQvavpFoW.jpg", "actors": ["Sorapong Chatree (Boonsong)", "Yuenyong Opakul ()", "Ron Rittichai (Khamron)", "Ittisoontorn Vichailak (Chai)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
