The intimate moments right before heading out onto the stage as well as the feelings after a euphoric show clearly depict the band members as a family of sorts.  Right from the beginning, PMMP's line-up has remained the same as well as their self motivated way of creating and performing music; refreshing alternative in a conservative world of pop music.  All band members are interviewed in the film along with the lead singers Paula and Mira, who usually stand in the spotlight.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hefJQdas1SzLh9hoFcqZISvMfcK.jpg", "actors": ["Paula Vesala (Herself)", "Mira Luoti (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
