The Goodnews River starts in the remote Ahklun Mountains of the Togiak Wilderness, where the nearest road that leads anywhere is 350 miles away! Join us on a float from the mountains to the sea. We weren't the only ones fishing! See how a brown bear encounter turns out.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
