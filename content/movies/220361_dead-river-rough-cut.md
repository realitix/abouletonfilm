They prefer the sounds of the birds to the roar of highway traffic, and scorn the money-chasing of city life. Covering a period of four seasons in the remote backwoods of Maine, Dead River Rough Cut presents a revealing look at an individual way of life. Wagg  and Lane earn a living and accept their isolation for the independence it allows them. But not everyone would want to draw water from a hole in the ice. They share their reflections about women, politics, taxes, the lone life and death.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wGiN7iH6tcT5408qWez0oWjLyi4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "sr6B_msM1FE"}
