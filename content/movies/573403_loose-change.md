On his way, he meets up with today's best surfers as their non- surfing counterparts. The acting is hilarious and the surfing is off the scale.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/exL9ZiXN9GWIDgx4QSuiZxbBXD8.jpg", "actors": ["Kelly Slater ()", "Rob Machado ()", "Taylor Knox ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
