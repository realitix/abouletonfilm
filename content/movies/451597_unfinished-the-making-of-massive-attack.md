The documentary looks at the emergence of the 'Bristol Sound' in the 1980s culminating in the release of Massive Attack's first album. Narrated by actor Paul McGann - who was a part of Bristol's creative scene throughout this period - it traces the history of the scene. From the sound system culture that arrived in the city with the immigrants from the Caribbean, and how that mixed with the existing punk and new wave scene in Bristol, to hip-hop which arrived in Bristol from New York before any other city in Britain was aware of it. It explores how this clash of cultures and musical styles gave the city a musical identity which to that point it lacked, unlike other industrial cities in Britain such as Liverpool and Manchester.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jw8JmFooGy5ox6sb4eRFP5LmIS3.jpg", "actors": ["Paul McGann (Narrator (Voice))", "Massive Attack (Themselves)", "Roni Size (Himself)", "Andy Batten Foster (Himself)", "Sheryl Garratt (Herself)", "Milo Johnson (Himself)", "Mark Stewart (Himself)", "Neil Davidge (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
