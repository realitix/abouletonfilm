But in his hometown of Mostar, in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, this simple social obligation has the potential to get him into all kinds of trouble: with his neighbors or even with local political bigwigs. Yet if he does not go, his wife will think he's a coward, the grieving family will never forgive him - and he might have trouble forgiving himself. This is a compelling tale of everyday life in a fractured society, and a world where paranoia, comedy and drama co-exist. It is also an astute psychological portrait of a man who is forced to cross the invisible line that divides two communities. Above all, it is the story of a man who lost everything that defined him, when his country disintegrated.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/snIvBHAObMGNWjyhQiKBfqYAofI.jpg", "actors": ["Bogdan Dikli\u0107 (Slavko)", "Nada \u0110urevska (Milena)", "Ivana Ro\u0161\u010di\u0107 (Zehra)", "Rakan Rushaidat (Kre\u0161o)", "Vinko Kraljevi\u0107 (Milan)", "Selma Alispahi\u0107 ()", "Sad\u017eida \u0160eti\u0107 ()", "Sergej Trifunovi\u0107 ()", "\u0160erif Ali\u0107 ()", "Izudin Bajrovi\u0107 ()", "Mirsad Elezi ()", "Had\u017eija Had\u017eibajramovi\u0107 ()", "Nermin Kara\u010di\u0107 ()", "Slaven Knezovi\u0107 ()", "Ivo Kre\u0161i\u0107 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "3F0d-SzEZgI"}
