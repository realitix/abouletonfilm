The first disc is a compilation of the \"World of Tomorrow\", from 1939 including the City of Light, Garden, Parade, Florida Building, Japanese Building and Lightning Fountains. This disc is a fascinating look at how the people of yesterday viewed their future. The second disc shows preparation, planning and construction for the 1965 World's Fair, under the imperious direction of the legendary Robert Moses. You then get a stunning tour of the fair and its star attractions.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
