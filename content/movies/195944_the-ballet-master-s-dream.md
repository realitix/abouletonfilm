But he cannot take his mind off of his work, and instead of going to sleep he paces the floor and tries out dance steps. Finally, he goes to bed and falls asleep, but ballet dominates even his dreams. He sees two dancers who seem to come right into his room as they perform, and that's just the beginning.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eD20OEcfD8P5xUMDxZgFnfNTpxB.jpg", "actors": ["Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s ()", "Zizi Papillon ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [119971, 196061, 196611, 108262], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
