The lead characters lead boring lives during the day and, as depicted here, downright pathetic existences at night, all decked out in peacock plumes and high heels and with nowhere to go. Several of the performances -- especially Fritz Helmuth as the love-starved, aptly named Bent -- manage to reach a little beyond the stereotypes, but Bodil Kj\u00e6r, of all people, delivers a simply dreadful (and one-note) parody of a once-glamorous movie star.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k8mC0CVHmzAVaYqfIwgytRHQ00m.jpg", "actors": ["Frits Helmuth ()", "Bodil Kjer ()", "Preben Kaas ()", "Jesper Klein ()", "Peter Steen ()", "Else Petersen ()", "Ole Ernst ()", "Lone Lindorff ()", "Preben Lerdorff Rye ()", "Elin Reimer ()", "Holger Perfort ()", "Edward Fleming ()", "Torben Jensen ()", "Hardy Dr\u00e6by ()", "Torben Peter Hundahl ()", "Henning Jensen ()", "Peter Ronild ()", "Sejr Volmer-S\u00f8rensen ()", "Hanne Ribens ()", "Kirsten S\u00f8berg ()", "Bodil Steen ()", "Ove Sprog\u00f8e ()", "Preben K\u00e6ring ()", "Mogens Steen Kruse ()", "Sandra Day ()", "Bobby Lockwood ()", "Lili Lani ()", "Bob Lockwood ()", "Daniel Sander ()", "Preben Harris ()", "Leif Trier M\u00f8nsted ()", "Benny Juhlin ()", "Preben Christiansen ()", "Solveig Sundborg ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
