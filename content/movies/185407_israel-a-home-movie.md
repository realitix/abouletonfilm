Rescued from oblivion in drawers, basements and attics, this footage shows daily family life unfolding alongside events that would shape the country. \u201cThe whole idea here is there is no one Israeli narrative,\u201d said producer Arik Bernstein in an interview, \u201cThis is no official history. It\u2019s not a left-wing look at history, or a right-wing look. These are personal histories \u2014 little moments that make up a whole and show something of who we are.\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7qGIyx459VL9VXwDNyYPGh9FKwx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
