In \u2018A New Leaf\u2019 a tobacco company scientist about to give evidence in a major trial dies suddenly. Suspicions are roused and Hammer is hired to investigate the boffin\u2019s untimely end. But as the case unfolds, there\u2019s a second death - a member of a wealthy tobacco family is brutally slain - leaving the private detective up to his neck in double trouble.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fOyeyIH4jNh3K5WXWfCYvtW0hGq.jpg", "actors": ["Stacy Keach (Mike Hammer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
