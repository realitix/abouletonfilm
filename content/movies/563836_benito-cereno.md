Cereno is in very bad condition and apparently survives only thanks to the affectionate care of his faithful body-servant slave Atimbo. When Delano leaves the dilapidated ship to seek relief, Cereno jumps in the boat and explains to the Americans that he has been the victim of a revolt of the slaves. The ship is now in their hands.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
