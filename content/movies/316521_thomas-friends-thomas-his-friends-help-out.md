That's why it's so important for Thomas to race to the rescue when one of his friends needs a \"helping hand\", or in Thomas' case, a \"helping buffer\". This special collection of stories highlights your Sodor friends proving that sometimes friendship is stronger than fear as they help out those in need. Remember when Trevor was nearly scrapped? Cheer on Thomas, Harold, and Percy as they rescue villagers from a heavy snowfall, and find out what does happen at the mine. All aboard for non-stop DVD fun and excitement!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mnqdZXJLdWIEXDTLHjlqSew83NX.jpg", "actors": ["George Carlin (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
