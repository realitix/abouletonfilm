Extensive interviews and intimate performance footage provide an intense portrait of the motivations, emotions, and methods that go into this uncompromising, sometimes brutal musical form. Unwavering in its focus, the film brings to light an art form unfathomable to many, with only the words of the musicians themselves providing any explanation for the pulsating sonic chaos they create. The unflinching cinematic style defies any trend-setting or commercial representation, opting instead for a stark portrayal of a musical underground at its most genuine and vital.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qiF7pMbb1CrGIlSBjPDkvjMJouJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
