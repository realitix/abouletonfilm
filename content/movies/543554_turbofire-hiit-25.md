The weighted gloves can be purchased separately if you choose to use them with Turbo Fire but they are not necessary to get a good workout and succeed with the program. The HIIT 25 is difficult enough without the need for additional weight or resistance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rl6qTyslPk4T9rQp237QRiAMvBN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
