Their son has just gotten married, a reception has ended and all the guests have left. She chooses this moment to tell her husband that she is leaving. What follows is an endless day: the avalanche of this long-gathering decision and what it means to a decades-long relationship. Fragments of conversations, silence and chaos, as nostalgia mingles with menace and tenderness with cruelty. What will they succeed in rescuing against the landslide of memory and emotion?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f0qhS1WzbLu3ap40sxfujv61BDq.jpg", "actors": ["Neena Gupta (Rinku)", "Rajit Kapoor (Raj)", "Dhanendra Kawde (Sunil)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
