These artists are at the forefront of an expansion of the gig poster genre. MONDO's reinvigoration of \"the film poster as an art form,\" and Gallery 1988\u2019s theme based exhibits are only two ways in which this artwork is reaching a greater public. In a community with strong roots, dating back to the 1960s, this expansion is controversial- refreshing to some, sacrilegious to others.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i2UsYIW0Y5CsNQwej7IN49kXdwe.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Bk8yZoSauOU"}
