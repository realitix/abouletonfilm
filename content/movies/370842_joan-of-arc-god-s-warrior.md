Joan was an extraordinary figure - a female warrior in an age that believed women couldn't fight, let alone lead an army. But Joan was driven by faith and today, more than ever, we are acutely aware of the power of faith to drive actions for good or ill.  Since her death, Joan has become an icon for almost everyone: the left and the right, Catholics and Protestants, traditionalists and feminists. But where, in all of this, is the real Joan - the experiences of a teenage peasant girl who achieved the seemingly impossible? Through an astonishing manuscript, we can hear Joan's own words at her trial and, as Helen unpicks Joan's story and places her back in the world that she inhabited, the real human Joan emerges.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3YBM9yrMsWAX8tqq0A6pb13fwhd.jpg", "actors": ["Helen Castor (Presenter)", "Georgia Moffett (Joan of Arc)", "Michael Feast (Bishop Pierre Cauchon)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "pZhT6kUfbWs"}
