However, the few residents who remain in the secluded cottage town of Rideau Ferry don\u2019t seem to take kindly to strangers\u2026  From the moment they reach their destination, the visitors, a group of twenty-something artist types, are confronted by the ominous gaze of neighbouring cottagers, all of whom have no choice but to tough out the cold winter in this small, rural town. Over the course of their stay, the friends begin to uncover dark details about the inhabitants of the houses around them. After one of the friends is found mutilated on the front porch of a nearby cottage, the friends quickly discover that nothing is what it seems.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c9DAxucK727bWNOLpHmOvdXDsGK.jpg", "actors": ["Kelly Hurcomb (Kelly)", "Tatyana Olal (Tatyana)", "Garrett Johnson (Garrett)", "Melina Trimarchi (Melina)", "Zoe Slobodzian (Meghan)", "Bruce Watts (Bruce Kingsley)", "Brett Howie (Glenn)", "Matt Smith (Sander Node)", "Brad MacDonald (Brad)", "Joseph Simmons (Joe)", "Tracy Butler (Tracy Gellar)", "David Kuyek (Dave)", "Tara Desmond (J.C.)", "Zoe Christmas (Zoe)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
