Now I was never one to **demand** the nationality of the actor match that of the character (particularly one from so long ago that there is no way to be 100% certain exactly how said character may have looked). But it might be an idea to lock down a rough appearance to hold consistent throughout **your own franchise**.\r\n\r\n_Book of Souls_ purports to be the final entry in this very loose series of _The Mummy Returns_ spinoffs. If they had continued in the vain of the third entry, that's something I might be sad about, alas, these last two entries have decided to once again take the absurd _Scorpion King_ premise seriously (_Book of Souls_ admittedly less so, but still far too much to really get into).\r\n\r\nPretty cool ending credits animation though.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}], "recommandations_id": [514690, 484579, 324538, 460100]}
