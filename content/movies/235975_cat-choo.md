Cros didn't come any fresher than Buzzy, and when Katnip spies him ice-skating, he decides to eat him. But Buzzy has no intentions of becoming cat food and he tells the cat he has an ever better cure for colds. Buzzy brews up a concoction of pepper, tabasco sauce and mustard, which turn the cat into a fireworks display, and a blazing sun-lamp sets him on fire. The burning cat rushes out into the snow, which melts...and then freezes over him. Buzzy resumes his ice skating.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
