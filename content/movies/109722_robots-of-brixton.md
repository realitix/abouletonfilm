The mechanical population of Brixton has rocketed, resulting in unplanned, cheap and quick additions to the skyline. The film follows the trials and tribulations of young robots surviving at the sharp end of inner city life, living the predictable existence of a populous hemmed in by poverty, disillusionment and mass unemployment. When the Police invade the one space which the robots can call their own, the fierce and strained relationship between the two sides explodes into an outbreak of violence echoing that of 1981.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mG4VIx6VVteUI7zMDrOgCr6kNRm.jpg", "actors": ["Kibwe Tavares ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
