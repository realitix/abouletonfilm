In a fragmented, sometimes confused way, Juan relives the crucial moments of his life, always linked to the names of women. Moments that remind him of having missed numerous opportunities to be happy. Eulalia, her mother, a kind and loving person who dies because of the pain caused by the premature death of her daughter. Ana Mari, the companion of children's games with whom she meets again at maturity to practice other less innocent games. Margarita, the girl with whom she initiates in sex. And his two wives, Luisa, who died during the war, and Elena who attends her last sighs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ySDuMlkIiiY50KNEMOCGBK2m2z7.jpg", "actors": ["Pedro D\u00edez del Corral ()", "Jane Seymour ()", "Rafael Arcos ()", "Israel Morales (Ni\u00f1o)", "Ernesto Mart\u00edn ()", "Mar\u00eda Rubio ()", "Mar\u00eda Rubio ()", "Raquel Rodrigo ()", "Alfredo Garrido ()", "Irene Losada ()", "Diana Salcedo ()", "Esther Santana ()", "Conchita P\u00e9rez ()", "Alfonso del Real ()", "Nyree Dawn Porter ()", "Rosa de Alba ()", "Ana Gasber ()", "Manuel Rodal ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
