Another year comes to an end, it\u2019s cold and the steppe is covered in a thin layer of snow. When her husband, who makes a living from illegal fishing, asks her one night what she did during the day, she lies. She wasn\u2019t at her mother\u2019s, but at the bus stop. She thought of leaving \u2013 to find out what it might be to escape the infinite expanse of her dreary small world. But she didn\u2019t dare; instead she stays and withdraws into herself, unconcerned by who might see. One day, her husband doesn\u2019t return from a dangerous boat trip. It is said that a fisherman only returns if he has a woman waiting for him and that seagulls are the souls of the missing. At the start of a somewhat unplanned pregnancy, widowed and alone, Elza wanders ever further through the city, plotting a path between tradition and the contemporary until she\u2019s no longer on familiar ground.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nxX1QgLWOSdKodZYIaqRyNb7MLg.jpg", "actors": ["Evgeniya Mandzhieva ()", "Sergey Adianov ()", "Lyubov Ubushieva ()", "Evgeny Sangadzhiev ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
