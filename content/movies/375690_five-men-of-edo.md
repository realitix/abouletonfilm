The leader of these ruthless samruai was Mizuno Jirozaemon, who despite his high rank was in deep financial distress, thus leading to a tragedy that shook the very streets of the city.Opposing him was Banzui-in Chobei, the \u2018Protector of the Weak\u2019 who was willing to put his life on the line to save the 808 districts of Edo from the 80,000 hatamoto whose violent behavior threatened to destroy the fabric of society. Starring Bando Tsumasaburo, the first great star of the silver screen along with mega-star Ichikawa Utaemon, this is a story not to be missed. Torn from the pages of history, this true story has been told many times, but never as powerfully as this!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fripc2BTOBLfwe2Y9oYaTPP4sAH.jpg", "actors": ["Tsumasabur\u00f4 Band\u00f4 ()", "Utaemon Ichikawa ()", "Isuzu Yamada ()", "K\u00f4kichi Takada ()", "Masao Mishima ()", "Kusuo Abe ()", "Toshiko Ayukawa ()", "Band\u014d Mitsugor\u014d VIII ()", "Kawarasaki Gonzaburo ()", "Kogiku Hanayagi ()", "Kodayu Ichikawa ()", "Joji Kaida ()", "Gonjur\u00f4 Kawarazaki ()", "K\u00f4ji Mitsui ()", "Mitsuo Nagata ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
