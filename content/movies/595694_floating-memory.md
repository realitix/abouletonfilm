Before the repression by the Chinese government on 4 June, Liu was able to take photographs that have become evidence of what has remained silenced under the Chinese regime. Floating Memory contains these photographs, along with other image sequences pertaining to Chinese propaganda, the past, the present, and other symbolic scenes. Arranged using bifurcations and superimpositions, the video imitates the way memory works.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9kxmdOpktWipbAoEurfmXuXeBI1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
