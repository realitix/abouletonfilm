The footage they gathered is presented in feature film with very little editing. There are sit-ins, love-ins, animated discussions among themselves about almost everything, and encounters with adults on a bus and on the street. The film is a revealing portrait of a dissenting generation and its rationale.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zsVpjZRHbCP6tLH8pM9KZmIE6kp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
