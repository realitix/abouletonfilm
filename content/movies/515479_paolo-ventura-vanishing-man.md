He gave up a successful career as a fashion photographer because he just had to photograph the images that haunted him. Images that the artist had imagined as a child when his grandmother told him about her adventures during the war. In his studio, in a barn on top of a secluded mountain, he creates a timeless melancholic world that resonates the isolation in which he grew up. Ventura conquered the international art scene with his photography series War Souvenir and Winter Stories. His work is included in collections by renowned museums in Italy, France and the US.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i5nNjENrrUvUAOJF5WeqKWMHZif.jpg", "actors": ["Paolo Ventura (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
