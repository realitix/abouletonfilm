Thirty minutes of non-stop road-building action, from the surveyors staking out the job site to the first car traveling down the finished highway. A friendly host named George, entertains and educates kids as they watch real construction workers, the heavy machinery, blasting equipment and the tools used in every step of a road-building project. This video has become a classic, and was ranked in the top-ten best videos in Parent's Magazines' Guide To The Best Family Videos.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fwaF74FIEujL0Brr3YMk1iTyrmh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
