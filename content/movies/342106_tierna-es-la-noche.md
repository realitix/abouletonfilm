It only contains a barman, a man and a beautiful woman who lives in a bathroom. For commercial reasons, we have included two policemen, a drop of blood and a multilingual nymphomaniac. For aesthetic reasons, a tear and a negro. For both reasons, the film takes place anachronically, during the fifties and nineties in a make-believe city called Caracas. It's a story of histerics, like all stories, unfinished.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oNLUtqw2YBSpW3tIFzxRZu2hZ0M.jpg", "actors": ["Constanza Giner ()", "Diego R\u00edsquez ()", "V\u00edctor Cuica ()", "Mariang\u00e9lica Ayala ()", "Carlos Castillo ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
