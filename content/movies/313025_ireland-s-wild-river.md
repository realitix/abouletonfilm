It is both a barrier and highway, a silver ribbon holding back the rugged landscapes of the west from the gentler plains to the east. On its journey south, the Shannon passes through a huge palette of rural landscapes, where on little-known backwaters, Ireland\u2019s wild animals and plants still thrive as almost nowhere else. For a year, wildlife cameraman Colin Stafford-Johnson lives on the river, camping on its banks, exploring its countless tributaries in a traditional canoe, following the river from dawn to dusk through the four seasons, on a quest to film the natural history of the Shannon as it has never been seen or heard or experienced before.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oOXtnsn8CP1Gp8ymwInvhiJPlEF.jpg", "actors": ["Colin Stafford-Johnson (Himself / Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
