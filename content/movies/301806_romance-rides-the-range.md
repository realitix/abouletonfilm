Pretending he is only the foreman, and having his cowhands go along with it,Barry allows Carol and her whining, growing-ever-more-tiresome brother to believe that they are the actual owners in order to give him a free hand in running down the swindlers who victimized Carol who, with a brother like hers, was a victim to begin with.Barry learns that brothers Clem and Jonas Allen are the villains and,through a ruse in which they are led to believe there is a hidden treasure on the land they sold Carol, they try to buy it back bidding against Barry, who forces the price up.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ye5C3lfPfGVsdkzKoy7DXCrpIr6.jpg", "actors": ["Fred Scott (Barry Glendon)", "Cliff Nazarro ('Shorty')", "Marion Shilling (Carol Marland)", "Buzz Barton (Jimmy Marland)", "Bob Kortman (Clem Allen)", "Theodore Lorch (Jonas Allen)", "Frank Yaconelli (Tony)", "Jack Evans (Henchman Buck)", "Phil Dunham (Doctor)", "Billy Steuer (Slick)", "White King (White King - Barry's Horse)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
