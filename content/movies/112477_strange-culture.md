The work of Kurtz and other CAE members dealt with genetically modified food and other issues of science and public policy. After his wife, Hope, died of heart failure, paramedics arrived and became suspicious when they noticed petri dishes and other scientific equipment related to Kurtz's art in his home. They summoned the FBI, who detained Kurtz within hours on suspicion of bioterrorism.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Alvkt2QmaTPDMiahkn37yupH4Nm.jpg", "actors": ["Tilda Swinton (Hope Kurtz)", "Thomas Jay Ryan (Himself)", "Josh Kornbluth (Himself)", "Peter Coyote (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [102867, 46391, 40620], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
