To accomplish this, Josephine told them that she has hired actors to pose as brigands so that the boy could easily defeat them and gain confidence in his abilities. They meet Jeffrey and are disappointed to find the boy was a sorry excuse for a soldier - he is skinny, clumsy, not to mention his bad habit of blundering headstrong into any battle to show off. However, whenever Naga tries to point out his deficiencies, she is met with an angry masked Josephine who clobbers her with a huge mallet. Apparently this sort of thing happens quite often, but Jeffrey is completely oblivious to her actions, despite them being obvious to everyone else. When the three arrived at the brigands' hideout, Lina and Naga are shocked to find that the real bandits had captured the actors, but they are able to defeat them using their magic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bjGV6GjGJr4ojcgzg6km9UvArzM.jpg", "actors": ["Maria Kawamura (Naga the Serpent (voice))", "Megumi Hayashibara (Lina Inverse (voice))", "Rihoko Yoshida (Josephine (voice))", "Akira Ishida (Jeffrey-kun (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
