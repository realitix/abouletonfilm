Amy Schumer debuts her one-hour special in front of a live audience at the Historic Fillmore Theatre in San Francisco. Nothing is off limits as Schumer airs every hilarious, messed up detail of her dating and sex life, from encounters with unexpected body parts to hate-filled personal grooming appointments. In her matter-of-fact raunchy style, at odds with her self-described \"Cabbage Patch Kid\" appearance, Schumer tells stories of a boyfriend who makes dirty requests over dinner, the way she outsmarts her birth control, and a shocking ending to a seemingly innocent cab ride.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wLOmsJFSfUECLRx2XVFUyhd7lXy.jpg", "actors": ["Amy Schumer (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [355178, 211952, 44220, 75874], "youtube_key": "EmzPp33kl7o"}
