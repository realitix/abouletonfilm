It was so cold that the camera would barely turn, until the sun came up. The film is a very modest record of a moment in a place, with camera-movement making reference to the passage of days. Tholos is a film of a Mycenaean tomb at Nichoria in Messenia, Greece. Jasmine Tea unknowingly reprised a project given to students at at least one university, when they are short of ideas: make a film of a cup of tea! Garden examines an area of my garden, which can be sombre or joyful.
