Despite Ferris' political stance, Jared Whitney, a mining engineer from the East, becomes friends with the colonel's son Lance and falls in love with his daughter Serena. Family tensions deepen when the colonel's brother Ralph gives up farming to go to San Francisco to work for his wife Rosanna's father, Harrison McCooey, a leader in the mining venture. When Lance follows Ralph, the colonel, focusing his anger on Jared, forbids him to see Serena.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2l45aB3A2DypO1ehwt7WJf0JMyx.jpg", "actors": ["George Brent (Jared Whitney)", "Olivia de Havilland (Serena Ferris)", "Claude Rains (Colonel Ferris)", "Margaret Lindsay (Rosanne)", "John Litel (Ralph Ferris)", "Marcia Ralston (Molly Featherstone)", "Barton MacLane (Slag Martin)", "Tim Holt (Lance Ferris)", "Sidney Toler (Harrison McCooey)", "Henry O'Neill (Judge)", "Willie Best (Joshua)", "Robert McWade (Mr. Crouch)", "George 'Gabby' Hayes (Enoch)", "Russell Simpson (MacKenzie)", "Harry Davenport (Dr. Parsons)", "Clarence Kolb (Senator Walsh)", "Moroni Olsen (Senator Hearst)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
