The brilliant production was a huge success and ran for a couple of years. In 1959 Peter Gorski captured the performance on film in his directorial film debut. Basically it is a registration of the production, but Gorksi did manage to accentuate the details of the acting by using enough medium and close-up shots which give a view on the acting you normally would not able to see in a theater.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pt4pBEZSvFspn1oNVrorWL0n0mU.jpg", "actors": ["Will Quadflieg (Faust)", "Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens (Mephisto)", "Elisabeth Flickenschildt (Gretchens Nachbarin Marthe Schwerdtlein)", "Hermann Schomberg (Theaterdirektor)", "Eduard Marks (Wagner)", "Uwe Friedrichsen (Sch\u00fcler)", "Ella B\u00fcchi (Gretchen)", "Heinz Reincke (Frosch)", "Friedrich G.
