Too say too much about this plot would give away the secrets and surprises that gradually unfold, so what follows is the barest sketch. The story features two couples from Melbourne (both played by the same actors) whose lives and romantic troubles seem to overlap or perhaps intertwine in unexpected ways. University lecturer Christopher and his wife Sorrel comprise the main couple. A recent trip to Europe seems to have brought their marriage close to ruins. Avery and Gillian also experience marital turmoil when Avery gets involved with an older French seductress, Catherine.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/za631RCcBRb3AgKgxHyjOuMU56F.jpg", "actors": ["Martin Jacobs (Christopher Houghton / Avery)", "Gillian Jones (Frances Bourin / Catherine)", "Jacek Koman (Jeremy Fliszar)", "Angie Milliken (Sorel Atherton / Gillian)", "Margaret Cameron (Clare Murnane)", "Nick Lathouris (Claude Murnane)", "Fiona Stewart (Meredith)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
