Minimal variations in their movement can be seen. The screen gradually lightens, and a roughly hewn wooden structure becomes visible. The light-colored rectangles turn out to be window openings of a log cabin with luminous white interior walls which is swiftly rotating on its axis. Subtle changes in the light and the camera\u00b4s distance and angle transform this presumably abstract animation into a concrete setup for a filmic and architectural experiment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bZb3g2wqvW8vYUp2L4S8bow7JGa.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
