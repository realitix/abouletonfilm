The biography defines why Carson was an enduring star (his cool, his timing, his genuine laugh, his breadth of knowledge) and pursues his motivations and inner self (a loner with a drinking problem, a decent Midwesterner whose mother withheld approval, a quiet person who loved to entertain). The key to understanding him, argues the biography, is his love of magic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7P3WZEnYClQSYa5jjwa7irNK5eu.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Carson (Himself)", "David Letterman (Himself)", "Jay Leno (Himself)", "Ellen DeGeneres (Herself)", "Jimmy Fallon (Himself)", "Jerry Seinfeld (Himself)", "Joan Rivers (Herself)", "Conan O'Brien (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "D9eJfKkjT8Y"}
