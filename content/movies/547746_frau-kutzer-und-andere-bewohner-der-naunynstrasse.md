The street itself bears silent witness to the deferred good life of the laborer. If Germany is \u201ca little America,\u201d as the narrator tells us, could there have been a \u201cGerman Dream\u201d for the migrant worker? Or is Berlin-Kreuzberg rather the site of an ongoing nightmare filled with the specters of Germany\u2019s past? How do stories of place and of people converge on Naunystrasse? And how does this documentary speak to us today?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Dorothea Thiess (Frau Kutzer)", "Claus Theo G\u00e4rtner ()", "Tuncel Kurtiz ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
