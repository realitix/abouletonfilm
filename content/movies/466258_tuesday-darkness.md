I wrote this short with that thought in my mind. Mardi Darkness shows a small glance in the life of a recent graduate that resists to change, the possibility of happiness and above all the acceptance of his new life. Far away from his family, from what he once called home and his youth.  The short film was made in an experimental fashion. It was initially framed as a sequence shot but it was just evoking melancholy and the chaos went too unperceived. For this reason, I decided to use a split screen technique to tell the story in a more chaotic and voyeuristic manner. It is as though it was seen through monitors that loop the life of a man who refuses to change, remaining so until it merges with the darkness of the screen and the unexplored.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fsw1y4i2hcXpq5nRp8SPgr7v90S.jpg", "actors": ["Alexandre Pottin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
