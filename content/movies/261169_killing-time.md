She is about to watch a film when a masked man suddenly appears in the living room. She thinks it\u2019s a friend joking around. 12 June 2013, Huntsville, Texas: In Huntsville State Penitentiary, preparations are underway for execution #499. A little after 6pm, Elroy Chester will be executed by lethal injection for the rape of Erin and Claire DeLeon and the murder of their uncle, fireman Billy Ryman. Killing Time reconstructs an old murder, and shows the impact on the family members and victims during the day of execution. The family of the victims and the prisoner, the guards in the towers, the pastors, the journalists, the handful of demonstrators: everyone has his own way of killing the last few hours of Elroy Chester\u2019s life. Where one yearns for the long-anticipated closure of the case, the other faces oblivion", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/88ZrIegHoqEpDzy9qUqB3LhDwhL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
