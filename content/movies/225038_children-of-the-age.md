The couple has a cozy life; they have a baby but he is cared for by their maid so Maria can spend her time doing terrific things like going shopping. During one of these consumer afternoons Maria meets by chance an old friend, Lidia, who will introduce her to exclusive idle social circles. Soon Maria's beauty attracts the interest of Lebedev, a rich old libertine. From that point on Maria suffers continual sexual harassment (worthy of inclusion of any silent film encyclopedia article on beleaguered heroines) which she resists for a time. In the end however she falls into his bourgeois claws.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qlI3UNDuImR3UONgUMOufYRr3ml.jpg", "actors": ["Arseniy Bibikov (Lebedev)", "V.
