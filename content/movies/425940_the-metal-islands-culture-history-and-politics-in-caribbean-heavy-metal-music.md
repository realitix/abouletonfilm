It is nearly impossible to capture the entire history of metal in the region given its prolific output. Nevertheless, this documentary sheds some light on three metal scenes in the Spanish-speaking Caribbean: Cuba, Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. The documentary examines how each island's metal scene has been influenced by history, culture, and political context.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fNEQY4TLUcGgTjMuWaq10ZZBaJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
