With a squad as colorful as its owner, the Raiders captivated a large number of black and Hispanic fans in L.A. at a time when gang warfare, immigration and the real estate boom were rapidly changing the city. The L.A. Raiders morphed into a worldwide brand as the team\u2019s colors, swagger and anti-establishment ethos became linked with the hip-hop scene that was permeating South Central Los Angeles. Rapper-turned-filmmaker Ice Cube was not only witness to this evolution, he was also a part of it. As a member of the notorious rap group N.W.A, Ice Cube helped make the silver and black culturally significant to a new generation and demographic. Still a die-hard Raiders fan, Cube will explore the unlikely marriage between the NFL\u2019s rebel franchise and America\u2019s glamour city and show how pro football\u2019s outlaw team became the toast of La La Land.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ffbKWC2UnOOdA0gPrwtzHVogVQk.jpg", "actors": ["Chuck D (himself)", "Ice Cube (himself)", "Ice-T (himself)", "Snoop Dogg (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [54694, 54680, 54743, 54742], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
