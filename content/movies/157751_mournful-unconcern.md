A large group of family and friends have gathered at this country house to dance, drink, and converse. Their conversation, in particular, is adorned with erudite literary references and quotations. Despite their apparent refinement, their preoccupations are simple: sex and violence.  Disquieting images break the tranquility of the vacationers' inappropriate idyll: some of these include documentary footage of starving African children, images (both real and re-enacted) of George Bernard Shaw going about his daily life, and a corpse coming to life on an autopsy table, only to cheapen that miracle by scolding a group of women. The music used in the film ironically points to its disturbing message and is uniformly anachronistic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v7v5xSNMmiG9lZ0ruzqXkp77hxg.jpg", "actors": ["Ramaz Chkhikvadze (Shotover)", "Alla Osipenko (Ariadne)", "Tatiana Egorova (Hesione)", "Dmitry Bryantsev (Hector)", "Irina Sokolova (Guinness's nurse)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
