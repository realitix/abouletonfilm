The temple is called K\u00f4un\u2019in whose roof has a tale passed down from ancient times.  The tale is based on the myth of dragon god: Once upon a time at a brumous crack of dawn, all kinds of snakes magically flocked to a waterfall. As soon as they merged into a single huge serpent, it started to fly up heavenward. But when it incarnadined his body with the red color of the roof, it transformed itself into a rising dragon.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A4pA1IQqcPhSv8SZCYJTLDsM9kD.jpg", "actors": ["Toranosuke Aizawa ()", "Masahide Nishimura ()", "Tsuyoshi Takano ()", "Akemi Furuya ()", "Umika Araki ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
