After months of rigorous training in the north of Australia, a team of 14 men, most barely out of their teens, set sail from Cairns on board a leaky old fishing boat called 'The Krait'.  Their mission, code-named Operation Jaywick, became a tense voyage through thousands of kilometres of Japanese held territory to launch a daring attack on Singapore Harbour.  The raid is a success but within sight of safety they encounter a Japanese destroyer, and all prepare to die rather than be taken prisoner.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pEGgPlpCPg1y5MT7dPrY5BcE89I.jpg", "actors": ["John Bach (Donald Davidson)", "Briony Behets (Alice)", "John Bonney (Rear Admiral)", "John Hargreaves (Ted Carse)", "Cameron Daddo (Joe Jones)", "Christopher Morsley (Bob Page)", "Jason Donovan (Happy Huston)", "Paul Rhys (Ivan Lyon)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
