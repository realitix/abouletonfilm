By following the lives of leopard mothers and their cubs in East Africa the film investigates what it is about the natural history of these cats that makes them born survivors. Perhaps the most extraordinary revelation is that leopards are living undercover on farms and even in cities across Africa and Asia.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z9GWZTVaQpkcM96faVMDiw63ut6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
