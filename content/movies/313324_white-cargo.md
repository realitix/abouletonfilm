His character is a daydreamer but he manages to get caught up in an adventure involving the hugely underated Imogen Hassall. There is even an appearance from a pre Darth Vader Dave Prowse although his character closer resembles the one he played in 'Callan'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dTn95T2AG96zgWGJJLVfX06kABC.jpg", "actors": ["David Jason (Albert Toddey)", "Imogen Hassall (Stella)", "Hugh Lloyd (Fosdyke)", "Tim Barrett (Fosdyke)", "David Prowse (Harry)", "Raymond Cross (Dudley Fox)", "Sue Bond (Desiree)", "Sonny Caldinez (Bodyguard)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [85551], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
