Aside from usual highlights such as Pyongyang or Arirang, this unique one-man documentary brings you to areas such as Chongjin or Wonson, still virtually unknown to even google or wikipedia. There, I attempt to pierce through the ever-present 'national mythology' and as much as possible, I try to connect with people - such as the waitress mesmerized by tablet computers, or a tour guide cautiously fascinated by modern pop culture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lfXWifoMlbmmQTwTTf3i4CHNzCL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "1EtfqpEX4UQ"}
