We stop to watch men tap the trees, harvest the sap, and load the product onto small planes. At a local market, we see indigenous life much as it's been for hundreds of years: Indians mix Catholicism with traditional practice, women live a difficult but uncomplaining life. Then it's back to the coast, to the prosperous Isla de Flores, a trading island. Lovely women sing us to the twilight, concluding our glimpses of Guatamala.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Krev3c0JKitIQdQ1zy4dd3RYbI.jpg", "actors": ["James A.
