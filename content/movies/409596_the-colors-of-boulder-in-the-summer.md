During this time we attended some poetry things at Naropa and and some cinematic things at the University of Colorado. I had my bolex with me the whole time and I shot little bursts of images along the way. The film sat in its can on a shelf in my studio until the early part of 2014 when I began to experiment with the images on my optical printer.\"", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
