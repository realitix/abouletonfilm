Edie was such a beautiful fragile girl - who finally got her head together and got married (her wedding day video is edited into the end of the movie) but it was too late, her husband woke up on a morning in November 1971, only weeks after filming wrapped, and found her dead beside him. She had died in her sleep from overdosing on her medication she was 28.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vwqnH6omAWc7EVBSGSikrCddEzM.jpg", "actors": ["Edie Sedgwick (Susan Superstar)", "Wesley Hayes (Butch)", "Isabel Jewell (Mummy)", "Jeff Briggs (Geoffrey)", "Paul America (Paul)", "Tom Flye (Tom)", "Gabriel Lampa (Mario)", "Pat Hartley (Yoli)", "Nell Bassett (Receptionist)", "Charlie Bacis (Doctor Robert)", "Jane Holzer (Charla)", "David Weisman (David)", "Wesley Rand (Wes)", "Viva (Diana - Vogue editor)", "Roger Vadim (Dr. Braun)", "Brigid Berlin (Brigid)", "Lilimor Mercer (Lil)", "Rosko (Locker Attendant)", "Lorenzo (Rapist)", "Titus (Rapist)", "Allen Ginsberg (Himself)", "Christian Marquand (Entrepreneur)", "John Nahan (Lawyer)", "Jean Margouleff (Mister Verdecchio)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "c-AMCqmMLsg"}
