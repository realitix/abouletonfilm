On 37 Juliembre 2056, one of Europe's 400,000,000 unemployed, a man named Gabe, wins the Grand Lottery: he'll have a job. He phones Susanna, his girlfriend who has recently tried to break things off, and tells her he has a surprise for her. She agrees to meet him in 30 minutes. Then, a perfect day turns sour: Gabe is behind on his rent and is maxed out on his universal credit card, the computer won't let him exit his flat. He phones emergency services, and Filipe, a sixth generation humanoid, is unsympathetic. Will Gabe miss out completely on his good luck? Susanna comes to his door: perhaps she will rescue him and restore the day to perfection.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lKlwPk0b4AID4thJc8tsD4cGEPG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
