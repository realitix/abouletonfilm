Set in various locations - including a gymnasium, an abandoned hospital, and a trailer park circus - Martin and Olsen slip between a ventriloquist and his dummy, a seducer and his surrogate, a doctor and his patient, and synchronized dance partners. The film examines a complex social psychology - questioning the colonization of the human body for various political, medical and religious agendas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rWvGt3rqJIkQ5xbOFokqvfFSpyd.jpg", "actors": ["Kym Olsen ()", "Trevor Martin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
