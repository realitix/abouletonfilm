He is foiled by the mischevious Swanilda, who masquerades as Copp\u00e9lia and saves her love, Franz, from the Doctor's magic.  Recorded live at the Sydney Opera House, this acclaimed production by Dame Peggy van Praagh, the founding Artistic Director of the Australian Ballet, is a triumph.  Brilliantly directed by George Ogilvie, Copp\u00e9lia captures the imagination with its dramatic edge and visual charm.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l0HLDNqD2ATAoxQTISdqkzYMFAn.jpg", "actors": ["Lisa Bolte (Prayer)", "Adrian Burnett (Franz's Friends)", "Miranda Coney (Swanilda's Friends)", "Robyn Corby (Leading Mazurka Couple)", "David Cranson (Franz's Friends)", "Anna Di Cardi (Swanilda's Friends)", "Mich\u00e8le Goullet (Swanilda's Friends)", "Greg Horsman (Franz)", "Martin Lewis (Leading Mazurka Couple)", "Nicole Marshman (Copp\u00e9lia)", "Justine Miles (Swanilda's Friends)", "Andrew Obst (Franz's Friends)", "Lisa Pavane (Swanilda)", "Noel Smith (Himself - Condutor)", "Peter St. Clair (Franz's Friends)", "Justine Summers (Swanilda's Friends)", "Elizabeth Toohey (Dawn)", "Roy Wilson (Franz's Friends)", "Rebecca Yates (Swanilda's Friends)", "Andrew Murphy (Franz's Friends)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
