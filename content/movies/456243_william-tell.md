{"tmdb_id": 456243, "title": "William Tell", "original_title": "William Tell", "slug_title": "william-tell", "date": "2006-01-01", "genre": ["Fantastique"], "score": "5.0/10", "synopsis": "The video documents a one-man re-creation of the fabled archer\u2019s feat. In it, an armor-clad protagonist emerges from the pastoral landscape to attempt the seemingly heroic act of shooting a can off of his own head by firing a BB gun at a polished piece of marble. Much like Don Quijote\u2019s epic charge at a windmill that he believes to be a giant, the protagonist is attempting a challenge that a spectator would perceive as both inconsequential and potentially self destructive, since he is essentially shooting at himself. However, unlike Quijote, and unlike Tell, the protagonist is aware of this danger and protects himself from the ricocheting BBs with a suit of armor. The armor and the gun, which can be seen as past and present representations of masculine power, actually undermine his image as a heroic man by revealing his vulnerability. This is especially true in the case of the armor since its purpose is to protect him from his own inaccuracy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xp12PVJijtpBwgh5UkCrG0byT16.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
