All seven of these rare, vintage films stand out, and each brings a new angle of historical perspective with which we can learn from the environmental mistakes of the past; the mindset of the logging and lumber industry at this time in American history was so different than today, due to extreme general apathy and lack of public interest in environmental culture and law development. Watch how forestry preservation theories have developed over the past 50-75 years! This DVD has awesome classic videos and pictures of forestry, logging, lumber, wood, redwood trees, maple trees, pine, red oak, sawmills, lumber mills and hardwood. From the unforgettable footage and pictures of the redwoods being chopped down in Redwood Saga, to the unbelievable guest appearance by Smokey the Bear in Vision in the Forest, this forestry DVD has all the greatest and most pertinent historical footage available.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
