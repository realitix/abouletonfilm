ARBOR suggests the fragility and ephemerality of memory and its artifacts through subtle manipulations of the photographs: reframings, layerings, inversions, and the introduction of natural elements, including flowers and leaves. The photographs\u2019 subjects rarely engage the camera; they are glimpsed, rather than seen. They look elsewhere, and wait for something inevitable.  Gathering on a hillside, lounging on the grass beyond now-lost trees, the inhabitants of ARBOR cycle through their one elusive afternoon, gradually succumbing to time or dissolving into landscape, reserving for themselves what we can\u2019t know---and becoming shadows in their own stories.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hBW6YLtjspOhLMPu55P8tSK5q6T.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
