Medina is cast as female gambler Angela Medley, who is forced by circumstances to align herself with outlaw Slinger (Gerald Mohr). But Angela has never gotten over her love for honest frontier doctor Bruce Merritt (Richard Denning), and at the first opportunity she redeems herself by catching a bullet intended for the doc. Henry Hull delivers the film's most memorable performance as Angela's drunken wretch of a father. Per the title, Buckskin Lady affords the viewer ample opportunity to see Patricia Medina in form-fitting western garb.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6H8VVdeQYlse7GbEckUZY1REWqT.jpg", "actors": ["Patricia Medina (Angela Medley)", "Richard Denning (Dr. Bruce Merritt)", "Gerald Mohr (Slinger)", "Henry Hull (Dr. James Goldsboro ('Doc') Medley)", "Hank Worden (Lon)", "Dorothy Adams (Mrs. Adams)", "Byron Foulger (Latham)", "Frank Sully (Jed)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
