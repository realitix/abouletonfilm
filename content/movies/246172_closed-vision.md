Compared to that film or Maurice Lemaitre's Le film est d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9?, Closed Vision is a more literary and downright genial effort. If Isou and Lemaitre were content to \"destroy cinema\" (exposing ugly, banal images or simply splicing in scratched-up blank leader in semi-conjunction with endless soundtrack harangues), Marc'O here seems almost to save it - or at least to invest serious effort toward finding a cinematic idiom equivalent to the novel's stream-of-consciousness (the subtitle is 'Sixty Minutes in the Interior Life of a Man').  Debuted at the 1954 Cannes Film Festival with endorsements from Jean Cocteau and Luis Bu\u00f1uel.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1t870PJUrFjZVwjEdzPTsoHEJkV.jpg", "actors": ["Dani\u00e8le Maurel (The Girl)", "Robert R.
