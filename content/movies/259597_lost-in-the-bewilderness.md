This story of international parental abduction, filmed for over twenty years, chronicles Lucas\u2019s journey of growth and self-discovery, and culminates with Lucas becoming a father himself.  Lost in the Bewilderness is not only a detective story but also a lyrical meditation on childhood, lost and found, and an exploration of how the themes of ancient Greek myth and tragedy, with the family at their center, are still very much alive in the modern world.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
