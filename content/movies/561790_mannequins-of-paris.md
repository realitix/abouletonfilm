Her first partner is her husband Pierre, who has left aside a promising artist career to design the styles which make their firm a success. The trouble is that V\u00e9ronique lives only for her job and does not allow herself -and her husband for that matter - a moment's respite. In Cannes, Pierre meets Wanda, a young singer with strange, fascinating eyes. The frustrated husband falls for her but gradually realizes that the light mercurial creature cannot possibly fulfill him. V\u00e9ronique, feeling miserable, understands she is on the wrong track. She promises Pierre that she will make efforts to reconcile work and married life. V\u00e9ronique and Pierre will live and work together again, each one forgiving the other for their faults.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wsZj1vm401ZVxsOccosvg6Ebebi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
