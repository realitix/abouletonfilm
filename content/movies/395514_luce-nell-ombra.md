Within a few days, his life changes completely: his best friend, after a wild motorcycle ride to escape the police after an attempted grand theft, dies. Alessandro learns the tragic news directly from the boss of his clan who, at the same time, puts him under loyalty test: Alessandro must kill the boss of the rival clan in order to gain final control of the territory.
