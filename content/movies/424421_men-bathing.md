Sometimes if the rains have been heavy, water stays in these pans, like small lakes, all year. In this film five Ju/'hoan men visit Nama pan. /Ti!kay washes the clothes he acquired on his trip to rescue his band's wives from a farm (as shown in An Argument About a Marriage). The other men bathe. The men use the opportunity to exchange sexual jokes with pleasure and hilarity. This film provides an interesting comparison with A Group of Women.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rJp74t2ULkLYMwRMazWrIDmAAnB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
