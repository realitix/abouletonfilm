Beyond the look is the gritty, bluesy rock sound that has kept them an enduring part of the music scene for many years. When MTV was new, it aired only videos, such as ZZ Top gems \"Sharp Dressed Man\" and \"Legs.\" This collection includes 12 of the band's most popular videos.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
