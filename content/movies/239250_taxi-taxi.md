Taxi!\" is a social comedy set in the metropolitan city-state of Singapore, told through the encounters of two characters who are in what is widely perceived as the most sociable profession on the island taxi drivers. Inspired by famed blogger Dr Cai Mingjie's real life accounts as a taxi driver in his bestseller \"Diary Of A Taxi Driver: True Stories From Singapore's Most Educated Cabdriver\", the movie follows the trials and tribulations of a retrenched microbiology scientist, Professor Chua, as he turns to taxi driving after several failed job attempts. Along the way, he befriends (although they didn't quite start off as friends from the get-go) a veteran taxi driver, Ah Tau. The two men, who appear to be polar opposites of each other in every aspect from educational levels, personalities, attitudes toward life and even the languages that they speak, eventually find themselves interdependent and influencing each other in ways that they probably had never imagined", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dsw4z5dWvSHojcbUrJHMzcDWyPX.jpg", "actors": ["Gurmit Singh (Professor Chua See Kiat, a retrenched microbiologist.)", "Mark Lee (Lee Ah Tau, a veteran \"Ah Beng\" taxi driver)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Sbcxs_73ijo"}
