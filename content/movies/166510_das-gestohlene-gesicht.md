A set of peculiar circumstances force the heroine of the story to assume the identity of another woman. When a murder occurs, the wrong person is held responsible, and it is up to a methodical detective to separate fact from falsehood. Edith Edwards and Fridel Haerlin essay the female leads, doing what they can (and more) with the dialogue they're given.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Paul Henckels (Professor Wrede)", "Fritz Odemar (Hempel)", "Hermann Bla\u00df (Lewinsohn)", "Friedl Haerlin (Roselle)", "Max Adalbert (Murrjahn)", "Ernst Pr\u00f6ckl (Reporter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
