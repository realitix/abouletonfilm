A woman is in a bedroom, another wears an apron: they work with their hands, occasionally looking up. A man enters a room, a woman smiles. He sits, another man sits and smokes. The cat stretches. There are close-ups of each. The light is dim; a filter accentuates red. A bare foot stands on a satin sheet. A woman disrobes. She pets the cat.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gMLoPZAHhdnUIOAE7w3UuCjVVQA.jpg", "actors": ["Stan Brakhage (Self)", "Jane Brakhage (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [126189, 97513, 97517, 126216], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
