In July 2016, Reynolds broadcast, via Facebook Live, the moments after the murder of her partner Philando Castile by a police officer during a traffic stop in Minnesota. Reynolds' video circulated widely online and amassed over six million views. In November 2016, with the assistance of Chisenhale Gallery, artist Luke Willis Thompson established a conversation with Reynolds, and her lawyer, and invited Reynolds to work with him on the production of an artwork. Thompson proposed to make an aesthetic response that could act as a \u2018sister-image\u2019 to Reynolds\u2019 video broadcast. Thompson and Reynolds agreed to produce a film together, to be presented in London, and which would break with the well-known image of Reynolds, caught in a moment of violence and distributed within a constant flow of news.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Diamond Reynolds (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
