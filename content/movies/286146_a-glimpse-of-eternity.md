This DVD is definitely an eye opening preview of the suddenness of death, reality of hell and the mercy of God for a praying mother.  After you watch this DVD you will be compelled to share it with others.  Parents, Adults, Teenagers,  you can't afford NOT to watch this!  I have taken a high quality \"A Glimpse of Eternity\" testimony in windows media, converted and created this DVD to play in most DVD players. The DVD is approximately 1 hour long.  This is a reenactment of what had happened to Ian and a round table interview after the reenactment.  This DVD is a real-life testimonial experience of what this man endured during his real-life visit to Hell and then Heaven!  \"My sincere hope is that this testimony is the closest you will ever come to experiencing hell for yourself.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/phcgVcozHB1oAJHDXHMrorsolst.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
