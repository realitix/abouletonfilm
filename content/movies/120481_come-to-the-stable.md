It is a simple, reverent story of French nuns and their powerful faith as they push New Englanders toward funding a new hospital. Old-fashioned and tedious by the standards of today, it ought to be remembered if only for it's Oscar nominations (none of which earned a an Oscar).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6clUGTNoDaKNR2a3QNGXVWaoE5O.jpg", "actors": ["Loretta Young (Sister Margaret)", "Celeste Holm (Sister Scholastica)", "Hugh Marlowe (Robert Masen)", "Elsa Lanchester (Amelia Potts)", "Thomas Gomez (Luigi Rossi)", "Dorothy Patrick (Kitty)", "Basil Ruysdael (The Bishop)", "Dooley Wilson (Anthony James)", "Regis Toomey (Monsignor Talbot)", "Mike Mazurki (Sam)", "Henri Letondal (Father Barraud (uncredited))", "Gordon Gebert (Willie Matthews (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [94251, 43888, 151857, 87531], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
