In CAN -- The Documentary,  the remaining band members are interviewed amidst culled together archival footage from talk shows, concerts, and television appearances to paint a portrait of a band who always remained happily on the sidelines of mass appeal, mixing street music, jazz, folk, and rock into a sometimes poppy, sometimes abstract stew. The band's influence on such seminal acts as Sonic Youth and Talking Heads is also analyzed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2EM4b7yMgLbU7Um0vZ9pMC8fyaz.jpg", "actors": ["Holger Czukay ()", "Jaki Liebezeit ()", "Michael Karoli ()", "Malcolm Mooney ()", "Kris Needs ()", "Shirley Karoli ()", "Irmin Schmidt ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
