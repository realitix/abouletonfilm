The scholar is a member of the reformists - a group of scholars pressing for social reform in China towards the end of the Qing dynasty. The Emperor is actually all for reforms, and appoints this group to run the country. This doesn't suit the Empress Dowager though, as she has no intention of losing her power. She orders the reformists to be arrested, and Chen Kuan Tai hence gets drawn into politics despite having no real political views himself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c7JCayPPogXlQE7UHHX2tN7Wxqx.jpg", "actors": ["Chen Kuan-Tai (Big Blade Wang Wu)", "Lily Li Li-Li (Tong's sister)", "Chiang Tao (Commander Pei Feng)", "Elliot Ngok (Tan Si-Tong)", "Danny Lee Sau-Yin (Hu Qi)", "Lo Dik (Iron Fist Yan Feng)", "Tung Lam (General Chong)", "Chiang Nan (Commander Wen Ping)", "Betty Pei Ti (Camomile)", "Ricky Hui (Thief)", "Ku Wen-Chung (Kang You-Wei)", "Dean Shek (Liang Qi-Chao)", "Wu Chi-Chin (Dung Gu)", "Wong Ching-Ho (Reformist in prison)", "Lee Sau-Kei (Reformist in prison)", "Lee Pang-Fei (Execution official)", "Shum Lo (Tong's friend at brothel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
