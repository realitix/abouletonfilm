The fact that Michael is Irish Catholic and Rachel is Jewish is a point of conflict for just about everyone in the community.  When the two young children are made aware of their ideological differences, it begins to tear apart their friendship, and they decide to test whose God is stronger. What they discover is that at the core, their religions really aren't that different from one another: both worship a God of love, not vengeance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oBGwNQVwvMxDTsLlCDOayCVhd7E.jpg", "actors": ["Philip Needs (Michael O'Malley)", "Loretta Parry (Rachel Mathias)", "Kathleen Byron (Mrs. O'Malley)", "Finlay Currie (Mr. Pritchard)", "Arnold Diamond (Mr. Mathias)", "John Gregson (Father Timothy)", "Sybil Thorndike (Lady Caroline)", "Derek Sydney (Rabbi)", "Denis Gilmore (Tom)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
