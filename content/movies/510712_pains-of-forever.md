Hinging upon Goethe\u2019s seminal novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther, my monologue speaks of the events that transpired between my parents on their slow dance toward destruction. This monologue unfolds quietly over footage filmed mere months ago -- intimate footage of my lover\u2019s elder sister with her husband, footage I had intended to show my parents. Communication can be painfully, heart-wrenchingly difficult, especially with those we love. When will our life end? When will our love end? Adrift on a sea of the unknown in an age of stillness rocked by chaos simultaneous and scattered, perhaps the only response is to pause in place, and stand allied with those unable to fulfill their love and life. To cope is to quietly confront the \u201cimpossibility of communication.\u201d\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zVxQwmQr4c7HXWhI5G7NZpCMfQo.jpg", "actors": ["JC Lehuby ()", "Jennifer Lehuby ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
