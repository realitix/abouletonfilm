They purposelessly gang-rape random girls, beat up pedestrians, deal hard drugs, organize illegal street races, menace witnesses, murder city employees and commit violent heists even though they don't need any money as they're all the offspring of rich &amp; eminent citizens. The tough police inspector De Gregori rapidly becomes very frustrated because each time he arrests the arrogant gang leader Stefano, his daddy's attorneys arrange a release warrant the exact same day. But when the gang's aggressions gradually become viler and De Gregori's own wife becomes the target of an assault, he decides to enforce the law slightly more drastic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x7YEFT8IDQ82XpuQMt4Tto2wFoc.jpg", "actors": ["Antonio Sab\u00e0to (Inspector De Gregori)", "Pierre Marfurt (Stefano Donnini)", "Cesare Barro (Bruno)", "Franca Gonella (Marco's sister)", "Pupo De Luca ()", "Gianluca Farnese (Marco)", "Giuliana Melis ()", "Bernard Berat ()", "Fabio Polverini ()", "Gloria Piedimonte (Rape victim)", "Roberto Bianchetti ()", "Raimondo Toscano ()", "Raffaele Di Mario (Marco's father)", "Giacomo Rossi-Stuart (Stefano's father)", "Gabriella De Rosa ()", "Claudio Ruffini (Thug sent to beat Up De Gregori)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
