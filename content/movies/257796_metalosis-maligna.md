Metalosis Maligna occurs when a metal implant interacts badly with human body tissue, causing the metal to grow tendrils, which eventually puncture the skin from within and destroy it. The movie shows the development of the disease from its early stages through to the gory advanced stages, by which point entire sections of flesh have fallen away and all that is left is a skeleton of scrap metal.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yCU411XWwpIpZvEsiHTbgwTyEeN.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
