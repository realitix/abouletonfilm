They are supposed to go to a party (guys only, who only talk about wanting chicks) but Shawn takes off with some chick before they get there, and Jim gets stoned in a van with two blond guys, who notice his hard-on and can't help themselves. Later at the party, Shawn catches Chris Allen looking at his dick, and to \"punish\" him, he makes him suck it. Then a bunch of guys line up to screw someone near the pool, and some other guys have sex upstairs, and of course there's the fantasy scene (you can tell it's a fantasy, since there's a smoke machine blowing while guys are in leather gear). The theme song (\"Getting It\") totally rocks.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/257Edu0HOOb7oY482kbig4OXLGn.jpg", "actors": ["Shawn Michaels (Kurt)", "Jim Bentley (Randy)", "Rick Donovan ()", "Jon King ()", "Peter North ()", "Dane Ford ()", "Erick Stevens ()", "Chris Thompson ()", "Biff Warner ()", "Chris Burns ()", "Chris Allen ()", "Tony Garret ()", "Bart Abrams ()", "Jesse Koehler ()", "Sherri Ann Lyons ((non-sexual))", "Brett Harris ()", "Peter Mathews ()", "Doug Gentry ()", "Alec Wayne ()", "Brandon Wilde ()", "David Ashfield ()", "John Tracy ()", "Mark Webber ()", "Dirk Cannon ()", "John Hart ()", "Joe Craig ()", "Steve Josephs ()", "Michael Dey ()", "Jeff Nichols ()", "Tanas ()", "Cody Jameson ()", "Len Harding ()", "Tiege Thomas ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
