She has no luck in becoming pregnant and this leads to an estrangement from her husband. On his latest flight, Greg, a professional pilot, finds out about a bomb threat. The person carrying the bomb supposedly wants to kill another passenger, a politician with an outspoken opinion on abortion. Unknown to the killer, however, the politician has already left the plane because it had an hour and a half delay. Greg decides to make an emergency landing in Dayton, Ohio, but during the heavy weather, the plane crashes, killing almost everyone on board.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ihTtV0dzpo5zdxisMXBKOK9UHJe.jpg", "actors": ["Cheryl Ladd (Diane Halstead)", "Jeffrey DeMunn (Scott Cody)", "Frederick Coffin (Wes Goddard)", "Peter Jurasik (Bob Stanton)", "Jim Metzler (Spense Zolman)", "Jeff McCarthy (Chet Harmon)", "Moira Walley-Beckett (Pamela Hayes (as Moira Walley))", "Doug Sheehan (Greg Halstead)", "Ray Blunk (Switzer)", "Paula Preston (Dixie)", "Gregory Feith (Co-Pilot Pasco)", "Jamie Horton (Agent Bryce)", "Sheila Ivy Traister (Georgia Kimm)", "Stephen West (Nickerson)", "Michael K.
