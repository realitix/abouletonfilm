Although he puts up a front of being in favour of the idea, along with his son Inder Singh, he conspires to field wives of friends, whom he hopes he can control through their husbands and through the caste network. Vidya, wife of Bhanwar Singh who is indebted to the Thakur, is one of the newly elected women Panchayat members. Vidya, who is educated, notices that the political empowerment of women is only on paper and in reality decision-making still continues to be with the manipulative old guard. Vidya decides it is time for a change.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hNL98qnfRFOzYEjXLtUb6klExhE.jpg", "actors": ["Manoj Bajpayee (Bhanwar)", "Vanya Joshi (Vidya)", "Kishore Kadam ()", "Harish Khanna (Hariya)", "Vineet Kumar ()", "Utkarsha Naik ()", "Lalit Parimoo (Inder Singh)", "Ashutosh Rana (Clerk in VDO's office)", "Kavita Rayirath (Manju)", "Anupam Shyam (Ratan Singh)", "Aditya Srivastava ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
