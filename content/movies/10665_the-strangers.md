To be fair, both films I'd seen in the same setting - alone, the middle of the night, in the aptly named \"Suicide Flats\", and what's more, I've since re-watched _The Strangers_ a couple of times and realised that both my fear, and my enjoyment, were perhaps a bit overstated on that first viewing. Even taking that into account though, and seeing it again almost a decade after that first time, I still honestly believe that _The Strangers_ is a good movie, with some pretty genuinely creepy elements.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"}], "recommandations_id": [10294, 18405, 2082, 83899]}
