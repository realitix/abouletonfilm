Featuring Neurosis, ISIS, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Pelican, Oxbow, Evangelista, Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra, Cave In, and many others whose music and art found ideal homes in the artist-run record labels of Hydra Head, Neurot, and Constellation.  These labels combine hard-to-define, heavy music with a visual aesthetic that has enraptured worldwide fans, without the need for radio or corporate media outlets. They uphold the legacy of treating music as an art form, not as a product.  This film is an answer to those who question where the spirit of punk rock is today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wSC0za9gt6PfbgBsBIpFdyJThiu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
