Most of the houses standing there are illegal constructions, quickly erected for a life alongside the road.  Karam Ghossein, who also works as a cameraman for other video artists from Lebanon, combines pictures from a commissioned production he shot on the occasion of a friend\u2019s wedding in 2004 with street impressions from the present day. Past events can\u2019t be told apart from the observations of today: a kaleidoscope of stories that take place on this highway.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3cGBfEv8vBvnAI5Vyw94dAjeIaA.jpg", "actors": ["Mounzer Baalbaki ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
