Pursued by Sheik David and his men, Mike takes refuge in the suite of Nancy Brooks, who is in the British Intelligence. He asks her to hide a gun and escapes through a window. Reporting the affair to British Consul Herbert Forbes, the latter tries to discourage him from further investigation, as the British are aware of the plot and are planning on staging a coup. He goes with Mike to Nancy's apartment, and she denies having ever seen him before. Sheik Ibrahim, next in command of the Arab tribe to Sheik David, is plotting with Nazi agent Yussof Streyer to kill David who is friendly with the British. Mike and Nancy have gone to David's camp, escape from Ibrahim's henchmen, and get back to El Moktar before the Arabs attack the garrison.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g35UHtYvpX234iBsqh5NzzPX05U.jpg", "actors": ["Walter Woolf King (Mike Malone)", "Joan Woodbury (Nancy Brooks-Graham)", "H.B.
