Aspects of this belief system lead some Christians in the West to give uncritical support to Israeli government policies, even those that privilege Jews at the expense of Palestinians, leading to great suffering among Muslim and Christian Palestinians alike and threatening Israel's security as a whole.  This film demonstrates that there is a biblical alternative for Christians who want to love and support the people of Israel, a theology that doesn't favor one people group over another but instead promotes peace and reconciliation for both Jews and Palestinians.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/leXsrxVfulg7LSE7MlyTmoNStpD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "wMcLfA_sfqA"}
