The result is a fascinating study of American local politics and a surprising tale of a man who, in the words of one commentator, \"has a city as his mistress.\"", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Buddy Cianci (Himself)", "James Woods (Narrator)", "Rudy Cheeks (Himself)", "Bob Dole (Himself)", "Gerald Ford (Himself)", "Don Imus (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
