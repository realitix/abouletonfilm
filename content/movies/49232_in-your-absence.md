His only friend is Julia, a shameless 15-year-old girl who is more than willing to help Pablo with his transition from childhood to adolescence, and give him some advice on sex, love and life in general. On a quiet country road just outside of the village, Pablo meets Paco, an oddly calm, well dressed stranger whose car just broke down. Nevertheless, he seems more interested in the boy than fixing his problem.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9wzRDrdcwQAiYZqSoXhxzZDqqKq.jpg", "actors": ["Francisco Alfonsin (Paco)", "Pedro Salido Saborido (Adult Pablo)", "Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez Salas (Pablo)", "Anabel Azuar (Pablo's Mother)", "Ana Tutor (Julia)", "Antonio J.
