Now her rapist is out on parole, and since he's the father of the child and has shown signs of rehabilitation, he's been granted visitation rights by a judge. Slowly but predictably, Lacey realizes things just aren't right with him, but thanks to her rapists manipulation, everybody she knows, from her boss to her friends, dismisses her feelings and thinks she's crazy.
