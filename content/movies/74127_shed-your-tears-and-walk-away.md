Beginning with a personal quest for understanding, the film moves into a year-long drama of human tragedy and redemption as principal character Cass comes to terms with his own mortality and attempts to lift himself out of his cycle of self-destruction. This core narrative carves an upward arc through an intimate study of a place often described as paradise, but which harbours an undertow of lethal hedonism and disillusionment. As people continue to kill themselves during the making of the film, a maelstrom of conflicting values throws up unexpected truths about the human condition.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pe49nEyl7X535lkmXOIAfLF3kjL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
