With time spent in a metal factory and a battery farm for chickens, her harrowing tale includes stories of sexual harassment and sick birds. Against this background, there are idyllic images of bees and flowers, cows and calves, intimate caresses, dead birds. Every thing is worthy of Dani's gaze, and is transformed by the encounter, becoming more human or sacred, and we are closer to the pain and beauty of being alive.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q5Tg1cdJG3z8RVojxj3MEQRmTht.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
