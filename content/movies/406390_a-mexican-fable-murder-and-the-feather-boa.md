Four years after her murder in 1992, this study of mexican transvestite culture documents a period of fear marked by 29 brutal murders. It originally aired in '96 as part of Channel 4's Latino Nights line-up (\"a season of programmes from and about Latin America\"), and--aside from showing up at a few niche trans-festivals here and there--seems to have disappeared altogether after that.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
