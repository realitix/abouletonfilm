Requirement: they had to be one-minute artistic short films. The directors come from a whole range of different backgrounds, ranging from animated, experimental and short film to documentaries and feature films. The result is a multi-facetted sampler of diverse formal and contextual positions with regard to Mozart\u2019s person and his influence on today\u2019s society, art and culture.  The contributions run the gamut from experimental-conceptual statements through socio-critical and documentary observations to pithy short feature films.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
