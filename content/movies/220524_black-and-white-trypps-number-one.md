It\u2019s an ocean, a well, a screen, a mirror, a portal. Blackness/void cluttered by growing ephemera. Dark reaches of outer and inner space gradually sifts through shards of granite and diamonds. The mind races as the material becomes greater and more frenetic, reaching a nearly audibly grinding pitch of excitement, flurry, and instantaneous infinity that ebbs at first and then maintains. Flashes of color emerge or are imagined. Chaotic flickering of dancing peasant girls and violently twisting astronaut helmets. Layers of sea slime over undulating life forms. Bonfires and celebration. Explosions, construction. Holocausts. Primordial ooze, modern civilization. Ages and seconds. Floating heads circle kaleidoscopic bursts of shiny beads. Everything everywhere twists, forces through, transforms into, overlaps everything else.\"  - JT Rogstad, The International Exposition (TIE)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cbInv987ZWvybXmdGX68xMUFWp2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [263841, 260405, 360069, 260387], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
