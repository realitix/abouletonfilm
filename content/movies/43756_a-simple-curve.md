He loves his father Jim and understands his reverence for wood working, coriander and Soya products, but he just doesn't get Jim's determined effort to achieve economic disaster at every turn. His father is a relentlessly unsuccessful business man, and as the junior partner in their carpentry shop, Caleb is powerless to stop the fiscal self sabotage. When Matthew, an old friend of Jim's, arrives in the valley to develop a high-end fishing lodge, Caleb sees fortune looming, provided he can keep his father distracted long enough. But a small deception leads to colossal betrayal, and soon Caleb must face the fact that he's reached that treasured day when a boy becomes man enough to tell his father get lost.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4qPetDryBtC3sPwsWpMzC8cyPcD.jpg", "actors": ["Kris Lemche (Caleb)", "Michael Hogan (Jim)", "Matt Craven (Matthew)", "Pascale Hutton (Lee)", "Sarah Lind (Erika)", "Kett Turton (buck)", "Michael Robinson (Phil)", "Ben Cotton (Dave)", "Waneta Storms (Diane)", "Andrew Rhodes (Party Musician)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "pancine", "content": "Beautiful scenery highlights this lightweight story about the relationship between father and son.
