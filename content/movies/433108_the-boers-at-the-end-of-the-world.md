They are part of a 114-year-old Afrikaans Boer community - South Africans of Dutch descent who sailed across the ocean to South America after the destruction of a war with the British. Today, less than 50 still speak the language and they struggle to keep their culture alive. Patriarch \"Ty\" Dickason, 82, is a cowboy who has never flown in a plane - and yet he yearns to one day visit the country of his blood before he and his compatriots pass away. This multiple SAFTA award-winning documentary is a portrait of the last days of the community - a parallel world where Afrikaans was never linked to Apartheid - and one family's journey to reconnect with South Africa.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k3klNQEPJCeIGbNsjIdPhP2xxAF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "6h39nq0KqHs"}
