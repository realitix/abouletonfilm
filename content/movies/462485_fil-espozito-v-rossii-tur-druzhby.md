The film covers the period between 2012 and the present day and highlights the most significant visits of Phil Esposito to Russia. Phil talks about how these trips changed his attitude towards Russia - from a sharply negative one, which persisted for forty years after the end of the 1972 Super Series, to a respectful and friendly outlook.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
