His friends from the previous films and the director himself play out a riotous farce about an overgrown baby who steals his father\u2019s cigars. Everyone mugs hilariously. The movie could be taken as another example of the Romantic notion of the artist as a monstrous child or misfit, or a parody of the same rather than the personal confessional statement seen so often in these film movements.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cPRyxiQxFESoCVpluOD7T6JG6s2.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Benson ()", "Stan Brakhage ()", "Yvonne Fair ()", "Lawrence Jordan ()", "Walter Newcomb ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
