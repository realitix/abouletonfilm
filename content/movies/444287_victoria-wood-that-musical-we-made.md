Victoria Wood takes us behind the scenes of That Day We Sang, the film she wrote and directed, and also looks at the real events which inspired her story. She goes back to Manchester to find out about the original choir of the 1920s, and the children who sang on the record of Nymphs and Shepherds. And in between unpeeling the history and sharing the fun of the shoot, she tries to work out how a piece of writing can evolve. Victoria unpicks the process in an attempt to understand how what started as a straightforward account of a day in the life of a children's choir in 1929 ended up as a middle-aged love story about the power of music to reconnect lonely people and give them a second chance to fall in love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wpQ6mNfnyvlH1kllUcKwldoC6R.jpg", "actors": ["Victoria Wood ()", "Shirley Court ()", "Martin Smith ()", "Vivien Pottersman ()", "Eleanor Roberts ()", "Peter Williams ()", "Dorothy Atkinson ()", "Michael Ball ()", "Harvey Chaisty ()", "Leslie Hattersley ()", "Conleth Hill ()", "Nigel Lilley ()", "Sammy Murray ()", "Dan Reilly ()", "Daniel Rigby ()", "Tanya Robb ()", "Stanley Rose ()", "Kevin Rowland ()", "Cat Simmons ()", "Malcolm Sinclair ()", "Imelda Staunton ()", "Sophie Thompson ()", "Sebastien Torkia ()", "Gary Watson ()", "Terry Wogan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
