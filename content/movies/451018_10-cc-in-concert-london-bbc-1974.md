The Gizmotron\u00ae was an attachable device that had the ability to create \u201cauthentic sounds of such stringed instruments as violins, violas and cellos,\u201d and maintain \u201cinfinite sustain.\u201d It was a remarkable invention by any standards and should have achieved what it said on the can and made much moolah for its inventors. Sadly, it hasn\u2019t yet.
