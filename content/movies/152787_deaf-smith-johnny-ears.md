{"tmdb_id": 152787, "title": "Deaf Smith & Johnny Ears", "original_title": "Los Amigos", "slug_title": "deaf-smith-johnny-ears", "date": "1973-03-29", "genre": ["Western"], "score": "5.3/10", "synopsis": "In this unusual spaghetti western departure for exploitation filmmaker Paolo Cavara (La Tarantola dal Ventre Nero), two friends help Sam Houston work for Texas statehood. Johnny Ears (Franco Nero) and his deaf-mute sidekick Erastus \"Deaf\" Smith (Anthony Quinn) go after a Mexican general (Franco Graziosi) under orders from Germany to agitate the populace. The film looks terrific, thanks to cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli (Once Upon a Time in America), but is often lacking in the story department. Perhaps part of the blame belongs to co-screenwriter Harry Essex, fresh off the dreadful sci-fi flop Octaman (1971). Pamela Tiffin appears as a prostitute, and the film co-stars Tom Felleghy and Renato Romano.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jreXf57YZkrNjrdX5PaEC9yrlBR.jpg", "actors": ["Franco Nero (Johnny Ears)", "Anthony Quinn (Erastus 'Deaf' Smith)", "Pamela Tiffin (Susie the hooker)", "Ira von F\u00fcrstenberg (Hester McDonald Morton)", "Adolfo Lastretti (Williams)", "Franco Graziosi (General Lucius Morton)", "Antonino Fa\u00e0 di Bruno (The Senator)", "Renato Romano (J.M.
