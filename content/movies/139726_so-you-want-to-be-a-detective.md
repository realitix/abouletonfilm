Like Leonard Maltin states in his introduction to the 1948 'Warner Night at the Movies' that Warner Bros. attempts to recreate with this (as well as the cartoon 'Hot Cross Bunny'), it was a clever homage/satire of both Bogart's detective work in 'The Maltese Falcon' and the first-person point-of-view camera work prevalent in Robert Montgomery's 'Lady in the Lake' from the previous year."}], "recommandations_id": [185412, 147391, 210826, 85673]}
