Instead of fighting for \"...truth, justice, and the American Way\", Superman is described in Soviet radio broadcasts \"...as the Champion of the common worker who fights a never-ending battle for Stalin, socialism, and the international expansion of the Warsaw Pact.\" His \"secret identity\" (i.e. the name his adoptive parents gave him) is a state secret.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y0z3f3DRjuKbGOpRSzAMtLIv5Qp.jpg", "actors": ["David Lodge (Superman (Kal-L) / Bizarro)", "Jim Meskimen (Lex Luthor / Jor-L / Green Lantern (Guy Gardner) / Joseph Stalin / Perry White)", "Kirk Thornton (Jimmy Olsen / Batman / Green Lantern (Hal Jordan) / Pyotr Roslov)", "Wendee Lee (Wonder Woman (Diana) / Hippolyta / Lara-L / Lana Lazarenko)", "Cindy Robinson (Lois Lane / Brainiac (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
