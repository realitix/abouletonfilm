If they want to move away to pursue new experiences \u2014 perhaps in nearby Montreal \u2014 they risk losing credibility, or worse yet, their rights as Mohawk women. Of course, if they stay, their opportunities in the tiny community are limited. With insight, humour and heart, director Tracey Deer (who left Kahnawake to attend school and pursue filmmaking) returns to her community to follow these Mohawk girls and tell their stories. Her deeply emotional documentary reveals the complex hope, heartache and promise of growing up Indigenous in the 21st century.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wvQTRja41NBAGDmlmLQId7mw7EJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
