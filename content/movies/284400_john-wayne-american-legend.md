Examined closely, Wayne's life is a startling series of contradictions. He was a member of his high school's Shakespeare club who began his career by acting in scores of B-grade Westerns, and though he avoided military service, he was considered an American hero. Filled with well-chosen archival stills, as well as seldom-seen early clips, this video also features interviews with fellow actors Charlton Heston and Ron Howard, as well as writer and scholar Garry Wills (author of a brilliant intellectual study of Wayne's work and life, John Wayne's America).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jslFFRviLfxdVIzSj9ufioluWyU.jpg", "actors": ["John Wayne (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
