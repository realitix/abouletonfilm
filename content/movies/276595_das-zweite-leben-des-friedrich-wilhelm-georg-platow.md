He took up service at the small station of Luege 34 years ago. Now, the line is to be electrified and Platow, who cannot cope with the new technology, has to work on a secondary local line. Georg, his son, a railway worker as well, is to attend a training course, but Georg refuses to go. Then his father comes to a surprising and highly unusual decision. He pretends to be Georg Platow, making himself twenty years younger than he really is and registers for the course.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k33neOeuqGL4bwEOS6lReZzH2ee.jpg", "actors": ["Fritz Marquardt (Platow)", "Rolf Hoppe (Dr.Hoppe)", "Barbara Adolph (Rennmarks Sekret\u00e4rin)", "Fred Delmare (Platows Vater)", "Winfried Glatzeder (Clown)", "Trude Bechmann (alte Frau)", "Hermann Beyer (Zolle)", "Gisela Hess (Malvine)", "J\u00fcrgen Holtz (Dieter Schildt)", "Carmen-Maja Antoni (Kellnerin)", "Hilmar Baumann (Friedrich Wilhelm Georg Platow (jung))", "Margit Bendokat (M\u00e4dchen mit Tasse)", "Eberhard Esche (Schauspieler)", "Lothar Warneke (Platows Sohn)", "Wolfgang Pampel (Wetzel)", "Gudrun Ritter (Platows Schwiegertochter)", "Wolfgang Winkler (Dritter Ingenieur)", "Friedrich Richter ()", "Jaecki Schwarz ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
