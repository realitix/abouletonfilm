They're in the middle of their marital troubles, and at the start of the film are in a bind- will they split for falling out of love, or stay for their child? Soon though, as the child gets a little older, the father leaves, and the mother becomes the primary parent of the intelligent, eccentric, and funny (in a 'French' sort of way) pre-teen. The film is highlighted with a terrific bit of music from Gustav Mahler (the scene itself is surreal when you first see it, but thinking about it it makes sense from the point of view of a kid), and a quiet scene with the daughter and her father late in the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kZ8KuvSdAeC95klwoaI3IYIFgb2.jpg", "actors": ["Aurore Cl\u00e9ment (The Mother)", "Bruno Cremer (The Father)", "Rebecca Hampton (Marie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [149145, 93553, 200785, 55847], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
