Since the 1930s, young men have played this gritty streetball game competitively in the alleys and parking lots of Chinatown. At a time when anti-Chinese sentiment and laws like the Chinese Exclusion Act forced Chinese restaurant workers and laundrymen to socialize exclusively amongst themselves, nine-man offered both escape and fraternity for men who were separated from their families in China and facing extreme discrimination and distrust. Pivoting between oil-spotted Chinatown parking lots and jellyfish-filled banquet scenes, the film captures the spirit of nine-man as players not only battle for a championship but fight to preserve a sport that holds so much history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mvkLc73ROYsEKqBFDd3a4PvVK5g.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "D6kbvIpQxUw"}
