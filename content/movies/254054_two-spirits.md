Fred Martinez was a Navajo youth slain at the age of 16 by a man who bragged to his friends that he 'bug-smashed a fag'. But Fred was part of an honored Navajo tradition - the 'nadleeh', or 'two-spirit', who possesses a balance of masculine and feminine traits. Through telling Fred's story, Nibley reminds us of the values that America's indigenous peoples have long embraced.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7bzK7UkoHysek36UkZDg8JBqtoL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "L6NtUGQwQIM"}
