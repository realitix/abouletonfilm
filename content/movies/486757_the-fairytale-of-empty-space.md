In the \u201cFairytale\u201d the accomplished European stage designer and educator paints a self-portrait by shaping the stage for an imaginary production titled Andris Freibergs. He transforms himself into a space that contains close to eighty years worth of stunning success, tragic loss, birth and death. It is an attempt to create the perfect empty space \u2013 one that would simultaneously encompass everything and nothing, the beginning and the end. The film is produced by the Riga-based VFS FILMS.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tg9emWeHCPrjZHiSrHIGASiphZn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
