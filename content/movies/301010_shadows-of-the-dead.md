The assumption is wrong and John and his girlfriend Jennifer are infected with a deadly disease that will soon ravage their bodies. With no place to go, and no one to turn to, they are forced to find shelter in a deserted cabin. This is where they'll find safety, but this is also where they'll experience a slow and torturous death. They must come to terms with their inevitable deaths, the temptation to kill others to sustain their own lives, and the consequences of murder. They will cling to one another's love and support, but in the end.... all great love stories end tragically.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vzVubi7qhxJuTWpuadyBWKrlqaF.jpg", "actors": ["Jonathan Flanigan (John)", "Beverly Hynds (Jennifer)", "Fred Dekom (Hitch Hiker)", "Jason Schwartz (Pizza Delivery Guy)", "Nick Schirmer (Michael)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "B0WgDg1qJPY"}
