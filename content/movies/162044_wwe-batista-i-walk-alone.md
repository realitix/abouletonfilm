For the first time ever, fans of The Animal can relive his storied career with this 3-DVD set that includes a biography of Batista s life both inside the ring and out. In addition to this revealing look at The Animal, this 3-DVD set will feature dozens of the greatest matches and moments from Batista s career.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nTFwcyRnLgx1v0JBbXv3oxEzNDG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
