Sequel to \"Boetie gaan border toe\". Boetie (Translated into  English as 'Buddy' or \"Brother\") wants to win his girlfriend Liza back, who just dumped him. With the help of some money, he engineers that she is assigned as reporter to the planned manoeuvres, where he would love to impress her. However, things turn out different as Buddy and his comrades are assigned to do the manual labour during the manoeuvres, and the arrogant Captain humiliating them turns out to be Liza's new boyfriend. But when a bunch of criminal madmen disturb the manoeuvre and take a hostage, it is up to Buddy and his comrades to rescue the hostage, their honour - and the girl's love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hhl3h0JEl0A4Y3PdGUB1ZKTn0wx.jpg", "actors": ["Arnold Vosloo (Boetie van Tonder)", "Janie du Plessis (Elize)", "Ian Roberts (Corp.
