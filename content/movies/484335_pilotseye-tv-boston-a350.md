The latest episode of PilotsEYE.tv introduces the new Airbus A350, made using the most modern construction methods yet for a commercial aircraft. The most important man in the film is the head of the fleet, Captain Martin Hoell, who allowed PilotsEYE to accompany him on his visits to factories in Hamburg and Bremen and even to the final assembly line (FAL) in Toulouse. Aboard the maiden flight from Munich to Boston, he describes the individual stages of manufacturing needed to make this, the first of 25 aircraft for whose phasing in he is responsible.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4k9jdkqFjRSeOnmJozu5k0v9Hr6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "xOifSK8hQcI"}
