The work sparkles with harmonies and expression, developing a whole story from just a few short stanzas. The Holberg Suite, loved for its beauty and feared for its challenges, is a fusion of European musical tradition and a genuine Norwegian sound palette. The Trondheim Soloists follow up with two brilliant soloists, Emilia Amper on nyckelharpa and Gjermund Larsen on fiddle, in newly commissioned music characterized by the same energy and tenderness. Wild nature and Nordic light are essential elements of the folk style. This lies at the core of the Trondheim Soloist's soul, a meeting between the musical playfulness and passion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/67upjI2WWNYHZQIsUjFlLSdTJQb.jpg", "actors": ["Emilia Amper (Artist)", "Gjermund Larsen (Artist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
