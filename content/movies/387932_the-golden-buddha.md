The friend turns up dead, and Paul discovers a small Golden Buddha inside the briefcase that contains a set of instructions. The instructions are only one of three parts, the other two being held in similar Golden Buddhas by Lo Wei (doing double duty as actor and director) and Lin Cui. When combined, the three Buddhas will lead the bearers to a buried treasure. But the nefarious Skeleton Gang is after the Buddhas, along with a buxom femme fatale (Fannie Fan) who isn't above showing a little skin to get her way. Luckily, Paul knows kung-fu, so the bad guys had better watch out!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aCRLx1IxvVgnG4UkBa36v8Dpkpv.jpg", "actors": ["Jeanette Lin Tsui (Chan Mei-nan)", "Paul Chang Chung (Paul Cheung)", "Lo Wei (Chan Chung Tai)", "Fanny Fan Lai (No.4 of Skeleton Gang)", "Fung Ngai (No.1 of Skeleton Gang)", "Chang Pei-Shan (Chan Chung Cheung)", "Tien Shun (Detective)", "Wu Ma (Policeman)", "Yam Ho (Tai's servant)", "Cheung Hei (Tattoo artist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
