Probably the best contemporary soprano-tenor combination (a couple in real life, too) Daniela Dess\u00ec and Fabio Armiliato are ranged against a worthy opponent in the form of Claudio Sgura as police chief Baron Scarpia.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/olYKHzl8YJu0rtst4wwr8639j0X.jpg", "actors": ["Daniela Dess\u00ec (Floria Tosca)", "Fabio Armiliato (Mario Cavaradossi)", "Claudio Sgura (Baron Scarpia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
