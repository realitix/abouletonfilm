Appearing on the show Sept. 9, 1956, Elvis sent shock waves through a repressed nation with his soulful singing, wild hip gyrations and raw energy, attracting a record-breaking TV audience of more than 60 million people. Presley returned on Oct. 28, 1956, continuing to provoke ecstatic screams with hits such as \"Don't Be Cruel,\" \"Love Me Tender\" and \"Hound Dog.\" In fact, these exhilarating performances were so explosive that Elvis was filmed above the waist during his final Sullivan show appearance on January 6, 1957.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vxF22FQSVpyMuouEfCvQAVRRUWz.jpg", "actors": ["Elvis Presley (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
