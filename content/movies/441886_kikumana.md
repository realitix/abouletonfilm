The primal aim is to get the audience feeling a strange atmosphere spread from this work. The image has a pictorial atmosphere and a documentary touch at the same time. Unrealistic phenomena take place there.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uIfFD3AUGtXl5wgIyn1IuY21N97.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
