She likes hanging out with her friends, brushing her teeth and doting over her Marronnier doll. The doll, however, has been created by an evil genius that kidnaps women, uses a machine to turn them into wax and sculpts the wax into dolls in the deceased's likeness. But it doesn't end there. The mad doll-maker's assistant, Numai, is even freakier. He stalks Marino, kidnaps her (and her friends), fails to seduce her, gets rebuffed, laughs like a maniac and tries to melt them into wax!  But that's before his other doll 'creations' come to life and attack him\u2026", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7RciBpZMUndWp4SCa8dlWI3a8yi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
