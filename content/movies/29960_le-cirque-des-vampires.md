It\u2019s technically not as good as the contemporaneous \u201cCountess Dracula\u201d or the earlier \u201cThe Vampire Lovers\u201d (1970), although it arguably contains more sensationalist thrills. Along with the slightly subpar vibe, it seems more dated than Hammer\u2019s earlier Dracula flicks, like \u201cDracula, Prince of Darkness\u201d (1966), \u201cDracula has Risen from the Grave\u201d (1968) and \u201cTaste the Blood of Dracula\u201d (1970).\r\n\r\nIf you can handle the low-rent, kitschy air there\u2019s enough to appreciate here for fans of Gothic Hammer flicks. As usual, the colors are bright and the women are a highlight. This one features Domini Blythe as Anna, the vampire\u2019s aide in the long prologue; Adrienne Corri as the Gypsy ringmaster; Christine Paul as Rosa, who has the hots for the Count\u2019s cousin; Lynne Frederick as the winsomely youthful Dora; and Lalla Ward as the acrobat twin, Helga.\r\n\r\nNo doubt superior later films \u201cSomething Wicked this Way Comes\u201d (1983) and \u201cCirque Du Freak: The Vampire\u2019s Assistant\u201d (2009) were influenced by \u201cVampire Circus.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 23 minutes and was shot at Pinewood Studios, Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, England.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+/B-"}], "recommandations_id": [39043, 3104, 28801, 29049]}
