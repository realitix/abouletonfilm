The film - using a blend of cinema verit\u00e9 and characters' voice over - offers a raw, intimate, and even uplifting look at how patients, executive staff and caregivers each cope with disease, bureaucracy and hard choices. It is a film about fighting for survival when the odds are stacked against you.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dJIHhLVPaSJohwytzfMx90Baw77.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [128140, 53263, 40428, 54299], "youtube_key": "NWIAjsf9Xq0"}
