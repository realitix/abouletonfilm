Liborio's artwork features religious imagery from the Catholic Church alongside paintings that represent traditional customs of the Solomon Islands. The film reveals both the strength and vulnerability of Solomon Islanders and celebrates the traditional customs that have endured through the collateral damage wrought by the Second World War, black-birding ships and indentured labor, natural disasters, and more recently, rising sea levels.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1XQ9BxKfgbO3VffYidST5o67KYa.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
