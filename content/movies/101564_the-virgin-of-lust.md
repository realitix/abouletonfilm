He falls for Lola, an opium-addicted, alcoholic whore who's hopelessly in love with Gardenia Wilson, a masked wrestler who slept with her once but knows she's unbalanced. Don L\u00e1zaro warns Nacho about Lola, and Nacho knows his love will be unrequited, but he'll do anything, regardless of how degrading, to be near her. Lola, for her part, can be sadistic. Republican exiles who are regulars at the caf\u00e9 encourage Lola's desire to assassinate Franco. Nacho in turn mixes this political mirage with his fascination with the plot of \"The Mikado.\" Where do fantasies and obsessions lead?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AuMpVoScqrVVOi69Jl2tanH8p4L.jpg", "actors": ["Luis Felipe Tovar (Nacho)", "Ariadna Gil (Lola)", "Patricia Reyes Sp\u00edndola (Raquel)", "Juan Diego (Gimeno-Mikado)", "Juli\u00e1n Pastor (Don L\u00e1zaro)", "Alberto Estrella (Gardenia)", "Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho (Toledano)", "Carmen Madrid (Imelda)", "Carlos Ch\u00e1vez (Ezequiel)", "Gon\u00e7alo Diniz (Fabregats)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
