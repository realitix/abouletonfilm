After a very good response, MTV Asia commissioned his company to produce a short film on the back of it. \u201cAs I was creating concepts drawings,\u201d explains Ben Hibon, \u201cMTV Asia was starting to plan their annual Music Awards. They then came up with the idea of \u2018launching\u2019 our project by using it to brand the show; posters, banners, trophy design and intro/bumper animations. So the brief changed from \u2018short film\u2019 to \u2018branding package\u2019 for the MTV Awards show.\u201d It formed into a seven-minute prologue / intro animation to the world of \u2018Codehunters\u2019, an on-going MTV/BLINKINK project launched around the MTV Asia Awards 2006 in Bangkok.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bXZ51AP6OQNdap5Ii595cXuof5l.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
