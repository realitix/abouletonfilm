The film takes place both ashore and at sea, and sketches an image of the fishing district through a poetic glance at Marnix\u2019 life. The East Shore in Ostend is the neighbourhood in which fishermen dwell: they weave nets, play cards and kill time. Now, this district is being demolished: high, white residential blocks are rising up instead. East Shore, the film, reflects this fragmented composition in its form: ashore, Marnix\u2019 life is enacted in scenes impersonated by him and his fellows; at sea we look more indirectly, through shadows, silhouettes and reflections, at how life goes on.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
