Naked City is John Zorn (alto), Bill Frisell (guitar), Wayne Horvitz (keyboards), Fred Frith (bass), Joey Baron (drums), and Yamatsuka Eye (vocals). Taking the band\u2019s name and first album cover as a clue, I drew heavily on themes in WeeGee\u2019s photographs (his major collection, Naked City, inspired the title of Jules Dassin\u2019s great 50\u2019s film noir classic which inspired the TV show of the same name, of which I obtained and employed a portion of an episode), recreating many of his pictures in their actual Lower East Side/Little Italy locations (a rare home movie shot of WeeGee--smoking a cigar--is also included.)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oFdcWMQ30vJraCF2GjhQJDtSjb3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
