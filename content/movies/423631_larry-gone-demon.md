When three twenty-somethings must deal with the incorrigible and incredibly demonic Larry, they risk life and limb in an attempt to save the soul of their once-kind-and-unassuming friend while also procuring his five-hundred dollars in back rent. Black metal, excrement, Russian gangs, bowling priests, and aborted fetuses collide in this riotous horror-comedy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wBykzKDMeG91N5KeMUlxKwhYXfy.jpg", "actors": ["Kristina Berger ()", "Tjasa Ferme ()", "Ryan Conrath (Larry)", "Charles Parker Newton ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
