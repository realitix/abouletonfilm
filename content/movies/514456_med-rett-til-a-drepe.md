In the far future a law is passed enabling citizens to serve out sentences for crimes they intend to commit, serving the full term, but with a 50% pre-criminal discount. Post-criminals and pre-criminals alike are sent to carry out hard-labour on hellishly perilous, far-flung Convict Planets. Few return. Those pre-criminals who are not killed, drop out before their terms are up, with nothing but scars and nightmares to show for their troubles. Two pre-criminals however manage against all the odds to serve out two full terms for murder, and return to Earth as minor celebrities, with the right to kill one person each.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xsCM1q91Q8CBnJvbEXVjgy9USgV.jpg", "actors": ["Rolf S\u00f8der ()", "Rolf Sand ()", "William Nyr\u00e9n ()", "Mona Levin ()", "Michaela Spandow ()", "Tor Stokke ()", "Kjell Stormoen ()", "Elna Hallenberg N\u00e6ss ()", "Ole-J\u00f8rgen Nilsen ()", "Jon Heggedal ()", "Per Tofte ()", "Torill \u00d8yen ()", "Jon Berle ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
