The film opens on Claire's birthday, she's 89; Max, a tiny cheerful man, is her close friend. Rachel is lonesome, missing her son, complaining he rarely visits. Ida relies on memory for her solace. Helen has no memory and doesn't recognize her daughter; her moods swing. Murray keeps his cap on and likes women. Staff members bring medication, provide care, and offer small talk. Memory is fleeting: Claire re-experiences the death of a close companion several times, each time without remembering her previous grieving. Lives are circumscribed", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9PtV0MVLzJD2wzqvgQyCw2yYV09.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
