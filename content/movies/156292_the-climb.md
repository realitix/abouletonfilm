Danny's dad is the only man in the neighborhood who didn't fight in World War II. Danny, who's 12, gets teased and folks make nasty cracks about cowards. An old radio tower on a nearby hill is about to be torn down, and Danny decides to climb it to prove his courage. Help comes from an aging neighbor, Old Man Langer, a former construction foreman who's dying of cancer and wants Danny to help him commit suicide. Langer rigs pulleys and weights to help the lad make the climb. Meanwhile, an aggressive and angry neighbor (an army vet) regularly gets drunk and shoots off his rifle, and Danny's dad must confront him. It all comes to a head one stormy night.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7rXhnd7EU7blRPg8JChwKWtwnIk.jpg", "actors": ["John Hurt (Chuck Langer)", "Gregory Smith (Danny Himes)", "David Strathairn (Earl Himes)", "Stephen McHattie (Jack McLaskin)", "Seth Smith (Andy Sweeney)", "Sarah Buxton (Ruth Langer)", "Marla Sokoloff (Leslie Himes)", "Matthew Ness (Wayne Barto)", "Michael Saccente (Ed Langer)", "Tina Regtien (Eileen Barto)", "Oliver Hodges (Tommy Sweeney)", "Michael Galvin (Father Cronin)", "Nigel Godfrey (Langer's Doctor)", "Dave Perrett (Joe Grace)", "Peter Rowley (Rules Rhodes)", "Richard Cox (Storeman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
