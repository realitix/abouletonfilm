Nienke's mission: to pluck Liz Burch from obscurity and give her a starring role in her debut film! This coming-of-age-story deals with the appeal of a character in a TV drama to a young lesbian and the excitement of meeting your childhood idol. But it's also about the pain of growing up, and what happens when fantasy and reality coincide. With animation, blue-screen, archive material and clever editing between Flying Doctors episodes and real life, the film pushes the boundaries of reality and fiction. Fan is a cheerful, poignant and fascinating self-portrait full of self-depreciating humor.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wbYVFtd2ayFIUTsQsz4NllArfly.jpg", "actors": ["Liz Burch (herself)", "Nienke Eijsink (herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
