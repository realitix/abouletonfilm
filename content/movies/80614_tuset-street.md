The pop culture revolution. Jordi (Patrick Bauchau) is a rich playboy who runs around with a bunch of high-end hippies, smoking, drinking, dancing and daydreaming about Tuset Street, an effort to develop a popular street in the newer section of Barcelona after the models of Haight Ashbury Street in San Francisco and Carnaby Street in London. Jordi and his gang represent the new Barcelona, wealthy, artificial and striving for imported sophistication. On the older side of the city is El Paralelo, the theater district. At El Molino, one of its many music halls, performs Violeta (Sara Montiel), a showgirl in the old style tradition who supplements her singing income with prostitution. Somehow Violeta represents the old values, the \"real world\" living along side an artificial creation such as Tuset.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wzqFfJlhjgcorPbRDCK9zlkWTQL.jpg", "actors": ["Sara Montiel ()", "Patrick Bauchau ()", "Teresa Gimpera ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "NYiJGdijkZE"}
