What happens when we set aside our individuality to act collectively? This documentary observes the passions that draw thousands of people close in order to join in a choral character. It discovers the crowd while it transgresses and experiences catharsis, while it seeks miracles and hopes; in continuous movement it splits and rejoins... until they dissipate and individuals re-emerge in their own solitude.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Pablo Riera (Director)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
