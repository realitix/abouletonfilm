But it was her best friend, Carla that she leaves a most special gift, a box full of her diaries through the years.  Carla has been Mariel\u2019s friend since their high school years; they have practically shared everything in their lives together.  Their two other girl friends, Sandra and Olive formed the quartet who would get together ever so often and served as a mutual support system.  Despite warnings from Sandra and Olive not to read the diaries left behind by Mariel, Carla could not help herself  to find out what was written on those volumes of handwritten materials.  True enough, what she discovered completely shattered all her perceptions and beliefs of the friendship shared by the four women through the years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kh2gKh4HcT4KB0p8h1RdpIZJP55.jpg", "actors": ["Judy Ann Santos ()", "Janice de Belen ()", "Iza Calzado ()", "Agot Isidro ()", "Lui Manansala ()", "Madeleine Nicolas ()", "Roeder ()", "Gino Dela Pena ()", "Kim Rodriguez ()", "Mikylla Ramirez ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
