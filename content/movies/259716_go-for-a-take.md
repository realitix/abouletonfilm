The Americans can keep The Godfather - give me Go For A Take any day of the week. Two gamblers hide in a film studio LOL. The jokes fly thick and fast as they avoid actors dressed as Dracula and swing on ropes and other things on the movie set to escape.\r\n\r\n\r\nSadly underrated over the years the film is now gaining a cult following and is slowly being recognised as a classic - receiving the respect it deserves at last."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
