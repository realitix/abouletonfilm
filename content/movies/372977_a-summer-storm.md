The dance form is thought to have been founded by Tatsumi Hijikata, who both created and performed in butoh pieces from the late 1950\u2019s - through the early 1970\u2019s. In butoh, the style of movement is extremely stylized and deliberate, vacillating between slow and sharp, expressing feelings of dread, sexualization, violence, calmness, birth and \u201ccreatureness\u201d among other things. This 1973 performance of Summer Storm at Kyoto University was Hijikata\u2019s last public performance before his death in 1986.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1N6ePHwLtLgMRl9xPjyg3PmIjG1.jpg", "actors": ["Tatsumi Hijikata ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
