It is the first film revealing the native pop culture scene in China, filling in a gap in Chinese filmmaking. The cast was sourced almost entirely from the Beijing music scene. The wandering storyline focuses more on creating a certain mood than it does on climaxes and denouements. The director is a pioneer of Chinese pop culture with a practice encompassing music, film and art, who became iconic by his unique aesthetic style. He is best known as the front-man of Beijing's most famous band New Pants.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
