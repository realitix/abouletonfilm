The story, told in flashbacks, as the two men travel through the night on a motorcycle, is loaded with highly charged eroticism. Sex and violence are juxtaposed against the drabness of the men's everyday lives, effectively blurring the line between what is real and what is fantasy. Founded on the well-known myth of furtive sexual gropers on the rush-hour Tokyo commuter trains, Tandem is a low-key masterpiece of Japanese Pink Cinema.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/MrhQcToB5iVq1RSDy6ozsje4MU.jpg", "actors": ["Daikei Shimizu ()", "Mineo Sugiura ()", "Takeshi It\u00f4 ()", "Hotaru Hazuki ()", "Maya \u00d4gi ()", "Yuri Ishihara ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
