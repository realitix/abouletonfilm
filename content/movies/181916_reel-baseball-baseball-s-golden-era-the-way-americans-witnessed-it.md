Witness Babe Ruth at bat; Lou Gehrig's \"\"luckiest man\"\" speech; Roger Maris breaking the Babe's home-run record; Pete Gray, the St. Louis Brown's one-armed outfielder; Ted William's final at-bat when he went out in grand style, ending his career with a home run, and other classic moments in baseball history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j2hCE5ZPrVVAXFYMTsnsminyD6Y.jpg", "actors": ["Stan Musial (Himself)", "Babe Ruth (Himself)", "Joe DiMaggio (Himself)", "Lou Gehrig (Himself)", "Ted Williams (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
