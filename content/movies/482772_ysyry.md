The child plays innocently in the stream when he suddenly shows respiratory failure after ingesting some water. It happens what is least expected, all the people dress in mourning for the tragic death of this child, thinking that he died drowned when in fact it was something else. The child's sister and the local doctor begin an investigation and that's when they'll wish they'd never started it by learning everything that's going on behind it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u3Fy3ZRl8qgTP4dGeq41hVH76fg.jpg", "actors": ["Alberto S\u00e1nchez Pastor ()", "Alicia S\u00e1nchez Noe ()", "Yannina Saut\u00fa ()", "Matias Maldonado ()", "Rodrigo Recalde ()", "Santiago Dominguez ()", "Alider Olmedo ()", "Alberto Blanco ()", "Ren\u00e9 Medina ()", "Ra\u00fal Medina ()", "Ra\u00fal Aponte ()", "Charles Z\u00e1rate ()", "Carlos Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez ()", "Juan Alberto C\u00e1ceres ()", "Pamela Maldonado ()", "Matias Mayeregger ()", "Cristhian Gonz\u00e1lez ()", "Ariel Mieres ()", "Humberto Leguizamon ()", "Domiciano Figueredo ()", "Heriberto Garay ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
