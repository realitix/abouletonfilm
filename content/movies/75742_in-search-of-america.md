Carl Betz and Vera Miles play the parents of shaggy-haired college dropout Jeff Bridges. At the boy's suggestion, Betz and Miles pack their family--including grandma Ruth McDevitt--into a 1928 Greyhound bus and hit the road, in search of you-know-where. The picaresque plotline brings the family in contact with a variety of colorful characters. Written by Lewis John Carlino, a name that would mean a lot more to filmgoers after The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea (1976), In Search of America was first telecast March 23, 1971.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xDAwrw836pvpbOOOSDQKP0g6cfl.jpg", "actors": ["Carl Betz (Ben Olson)", "Jeff Bridges (Mike Olson)", "Renne Jarrett (Kathy)", "Howard Duff (Ray Chandler)", "Kim Hunter (Cora Chandler)", "Michael Anderson Jr. (J.J.)", "Sal Mineo (Nick)", "Tyne Daly (Anne)", "Mary Gail Hobbs (Claire)", "Jeff Siggins (Announcer)", "Ken Sylk (Skipper)", "Vera Miles (Jenny Olson)", "George Wallace (Clarence)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
