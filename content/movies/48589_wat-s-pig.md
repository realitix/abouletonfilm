He makes off with only one, whom he drops about a mile away. A pig rescues this baby, so one brother grows up high on the hog, the other down with the swine; one is lazy, his lost brother is industrious. Years later, when a neighboring prince declares war, the brother in the castle is too soft to fight. Through happenstance, the twins are united just before the final battle. Will the upper-class brother let his humble sibling lead the troops to certain defeat and death?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AinBibneSQLKDhKxan19MJznoO7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
