The film's two stars, Jane Asher and John Moulder-Brown, 23 and 17 years of age at the time respectively, meet for the first time in 40 years and discuss their on-screen and off-screen relationship in candid detail, while director/writer Skolimowski chronicles the production history from the writing of the script to the film's acclaimed first showing at the Venice Film Festival. Director of photography Charly Steinberger revisits some of the original locations and explains how he managed to shoot almost the entire film with a hand-held camera. Also on board are production designer Anthony Pratt, editor Barrie Vince, and actor Christopher Sandford, each of whom contributes his own version of how DEEP END was part of the sixties' \"swinging London\"; and at the same time tilted it on its head.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jane Asher (Herself)", "John Moulder-Brown (Himself)", "Jerzy Skolimowski (Himself)", "Christopher Sandford (Himself)", "Anthony Pratt (Himself)", "Charly Steinberger (Himself)", "Barrie Vince (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
