Childhood memories of her father, a doctor, and her mother, an artist, are warmly rendered in scenes of the Jewish family amiably accommodating itself to the Christmas season, and of the obligatory communal vacations joined by colorful relatives. The abrupt transition to a flamboyant denizen of \"downtowns,\" Los Angeles or New York, to an existence as a character in the lives of marginal people, is evoked in sharply satirical terms, in a melange of humorous fact and fiction, monologues akin to those that make Bernhard an icon of pop culture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qy84UIX6bBQxnNI91uY8ezOUBwm.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
