It was not the low ratings or the bad reviews, I believed in the director, mainly because of her previous film 'The Guilt Trip' that I heartily loved. In fact, it was a short movie and I surprised how nice it was.\r\n\r\nIt was the same old story, an honest cop is framed into a shootout disaster during the witness protection program. She must bring all the strength and courage to fight back to clear her name. So the story is actually a road trip and all the actions are in the form of humour.\r\n\r\nIt was a good one for me, at least it should be a decent one as a collection of the everyone's thought, but leaning too much on the bad side that it won't deserve. Its very very sad a cute little movie like this and 'Tammy' are thrashed badly. Don't expect it to be the year's best, just watch it for the entertainment, or the time pass which might bring a better result.\r\n\r\nThe dialogues were fun, some scenes were good and I felt some were overused. The last year (2014) was one of the best years for Reese Witherspoon. Both the film of hers 'The Good Lie' and 'Wild' are the career's best ones. With this she's back to the commercial films. It might not be a great as those, but satisfies at least for the first time view.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd/10"}], "recommandations_id": [238713, 187596, 226486, 257091], "youtube_key": "eeMlkBkigIA"}
