Bodies, objects and natural features are shown from different perspectives and angles, proposing a sort of visual harmony within the silent film. Through geometry, texture, movement and stasis, Patella animates, creating a sense of communion with nature on a similar wavelength to Ana Mendieta\u2019s actions, and with a stark difference to the comparative coldness and objectivity that the work of land artists of the contemporary era would reflect.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iwMXO8N9ikqJIGM5QiIGuuZRG2h.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
