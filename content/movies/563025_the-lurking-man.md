Brikisak's anguishing and tormented character, Cailean, is beautifully juxtaposed by the people around her who love and support her, even as she falls into darkness. \r\n\r\nStand out performances by Dorian Gregory, Frank Krueger and Daniel Lench, drive home the powerful message of the cost of self-inflicted torment and how the power of love can conquer all.\" Casey Ruggieri - Actors Awards."}], "recommandations_id": []}
