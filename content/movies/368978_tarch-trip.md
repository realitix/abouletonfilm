The film is largely set in the film-maker's home and the street in the provincial town of Aichi where he lives. Minor everyday incidents are observed poetically; the melancholy mood of the images is boosted by serene electronic music. There is no dialogue; the sound track only comprisesstreets sounds as well as the music. Loose, almost nonchalant impressions of the street or of cloudy skies are juxtaposed with posed, almost photographic mildly homo-erotic portraits of friends of the film-maker.Tarch Trip is made up of fragments of a cinematographic diary, which are however not edited chronologically. Two periods alternate. One is characterised rain and dark cloudy skies. The other is sunny and repeatedly accompanied by three friends", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u5GoNTMqrX3GJgqKhGSb1Jo1EUT.jpg", "actors": ["Masashi Mori ()", "Masashi Mori ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
