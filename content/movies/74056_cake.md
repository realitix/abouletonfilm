Everything seems to be going well for life-long friends-turned-petty pot peddlers Kash (Archie Howard II), Shane (Chung), and Bones (Ben Baller) until their trusted drive is busted during a routine run to Ohio, and when the na\u00efve dealers try to recoup their losses by selling cocaine, they quickly realize that they've gotten in over their heads. With no one to trust and the Mexican mafia hot on their trail, Kash is soon thrown in jail and Shane and Bones left to fend for themselves as the hired guns close in. When survival instinct pits friend against friend, loyalties are tested and bonds broken for three friends who thought they had it all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3L0MNIEzD02EVQLfgBzm2cmT9Bo.jpg", "actors": ["Ben Baller (Bones)", "Dewey Canton (Baywatch)", "Shawn Harris (Clyde)", "Archie Howard (Kash)", "Taylor Humphries (Tracy)", "Rolando Molina (Benzito)", "Mas Mor (Whiteboy)", "Andre 'Doc' Newman (Plan B)", "Christian Redd (Martell)", "Jade T.
