The event was photographed, and the photos were later used for a fictionalised film on the failed coup. From then on, cinema in this South American country has been inextricably linked to its violent history. Moving images have been used for historiography, propaganda, disinformation and to instil unity in a nation that refuses to come together. Falsos positivos, murdered youths disguised as guerrillas by the army to simulate military success, are a common element.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/joagkOFtorl8XgEMaypSGQbQM3M.jpg", "actors": ["Aracelly Arteaga (Mam\u00e1)", "Carlos Atehort\u00faa (Pap\u00e1)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
