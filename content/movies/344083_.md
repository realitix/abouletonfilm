The imagery in the film is dense, wearying and beautiful, but ultimately hard to decipher, for, in contrast to his earlier, and more famous film Chelsea Girls, made in 1966, Warhol directed that two reels be screened simultaneously on top of each other on a single screen, rather than side-by-side.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iiNOQaPPAW6ckfzybEqk9GUlGQ9.jpg", "actors": ["Brigid Berlin (Ondines Frau)", "Tally Brown ()", "David Croland ()", "Joe Dallesandro (College Wrestler)", "Angelina 'Pepper' Davis (M\u00e4dchen im Liebessessel)", "Juan Downey ()", "Eric Emerson ()", "Andrea Feldman ()", "Gerard Malanga ()", "Taylor Mead ()", "Allen Midgette ()", "Ivy Nicholson (M\u00e4dchen auf dem Stuhl)", "Nico ()", "Ondine ()", "Orion ()", "Rolando Pe\u00f1a ()", "Edie Sedgwick ()", "Ingrid Superstar ()", "Katrina Toland ()", "International Velvet ()", "Ultra Violet ()", "Viva ()", "Mary Woronov ()", "John Cale ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
