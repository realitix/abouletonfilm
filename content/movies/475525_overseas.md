The town, geographically situated by the river, is the site of many factories and has the highest number of Burmese workers outside of Burma. It is estimated that as many as 300,000 Burmese reside in Mahachai. Most of the Burmese are working, both legally and illegally, in these factories. Just like any other day in Mahachai, Wawa Kai, a Burmese immigrant worker wakes up. She brushes her teeth and takes a cold shower. She goes to work at a factory where she grades squids and shrimps according to their sizes. But today she is not feeling well, and has to take the afternoon off.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/daLzfZ9PQFAMaoEqlKyLbadHTba.jpg", "actors": ["Wawa Ween ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
