The film follows the Ditidaht First Nation over a seven-year period, after a respected elder is found guilty of sexual assault. Award-winning filmmaker Maurice Bulbulian records the community's stories, becoming a part of their healing process. With the hope and courage of participants, the powerful interviews in this film play a key role in helping the community overcome the cycle of abuse. The continuing, devastating effects of the residential school system are also revealed; in this system, physical, emotional and sexual abuse were all too often routine.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zp1fVZ6s1f2YyCIh4iCzZLZLWE1.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
