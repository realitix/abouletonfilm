Complicated Drumming Technique is a first for us; an educational DVD teaching the craft of drum work (aka drumming) to beginners and experts alike. Respected comedian and television personality Fred Armisen brought percussionist Jens Hanneman to our attention with an ingenious DVD that opened our eyes to the responsibilities an million little victories that drummers everywhere experience behind the kit, unbeknownst to us. If we knew so little about it, then the rest of you are probably completely in the dark! Don't worry; Jens Hannemann's Complicated Drumming Technique can easily be yours as well.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8Wzy8QHcC75MjIIZkD81wjDBgZS.jpg", "actors": ["Fred Armisen (Jens Hannemann)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
