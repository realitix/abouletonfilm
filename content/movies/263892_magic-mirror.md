In Surrealist kaleidoscopic fashion the film creates a weave between image and word, exploring the links between Cahun\u2019s photographs and writing as well as between those of the films of Sarah Pucill, as both artists share similar iconography and concerns.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hrzIwmSypUHnyiwwfH9UnapcGuD.jpg", "actors": ["Andro Andrex ()", "Rowina Lennon ()", "Kate Hart ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
