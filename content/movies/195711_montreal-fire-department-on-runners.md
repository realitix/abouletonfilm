Next comes a chemical engine mounted on a stout double runner sled, which is followed closely by hose carriage apparatus mounted also on double runner sleds. Next comes a water tower mounted on a set of double runners and drawn by four beautiful horses. This is followed very closely by an engine drawn by a four-horse string team. This is followed by another engine on double runners, drawn by a four-horse tandem team. A second hose carriage and a Protective Insurance outfit brings up the rear. The breath leaves the horses' nostrils in great white puffs as they gallop through the snow-covered streets.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
