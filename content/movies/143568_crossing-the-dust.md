Two Kurds are looking for the parents of a five-year-old boy who has been found in the street in tears. His name is Saddam too. At the same time the boy's parents are looking for him everywhere, worried because of the boy's name which is now taboo. All the attempts of the two Kurds to get rid of the child fail: neither the Americans nor the men of religion at the mosque want him. Little Saddam begins to become a real problem. In the streets and all around them, they are surrounded by the chaos and crazy atmosphere of those days, with violence always on the verge of exploding.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fdsPxebokOJ7udFjjHi8q5jxOBW.jpg", "actors": ["Adil Abdolrahman ()", "Ayam Akram ()", "Hossein Hasan ()", "Ahlam Najat ()", "Aba Rash ()", "Rizgar Sedi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
