Giovanna, a servant girl, Lillian, a serious girlfriend in Rome, a hostess at a post-war party, Paolo makes love to them all. He also feels dissatisfied with a life only of the body, compared to his journalist friend Vincenzo and his own father, a sober and serious thinker. When his father is on his deathbed, Paolo learns of syphilis in the family and something of the curse of dissolution. Some years later, he resolves to marry Katrina, the pure daughter of the woman he should have married. He wants her purity to redeem him so he can make something of his life. But is it too late?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/795mrcGKD8cNNXsGG7htYBdZ3qD.jpg", "actors": ["Giancarlo Giannini (Paolo Castorini)", "Rossana Podest\u00e0 (Lilia)", "Riccardo Cucciolla (Paolo's Father)", "Lionel Stander (Baron Castorini)", "Gastone Moschin (Uncle Edmondo)", "Adriana Asti (Beatrice)", "Marianne Comtell (Paolo's Mother)", "Vittorio Caprioli (Salvatore)", "Ornella Muti (Giovanna)", "Umberto D'Orsi (Il cavaliere Carmelo)", "Barbara Bach (Anna, nipote del farmacista)", "Neda Arneri\u0107 (Caterina, moglie di Paolo)", "Dori Dorika (la suora)", "Oreste Lionello (pittore)", "Mario Pisu (Principe Lorenzo Banchieri)", "Ugo Fangareggi (Luigi Castorini, fratello di Paolo)", "Femi Benussi (una prostituta)", "Bruno Scipioni (Vincenzo Torrisi)", "Orchidea De Santis (una prostituta)", "Enrica Bonaccorti (Mariella, amante di Vincenzo Torrisi)", "Roberta Paladini (la pantalonaia)", "Andrea Aureli ()", "Carla Mancini ()", "Pilar Vel\u00e1zquez (Ester (as  Pilar Velasquez))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
