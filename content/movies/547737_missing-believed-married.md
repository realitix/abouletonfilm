But the plot plays second fiddle to the comedic performances of stalwarts Wally Patch (one of Britain\u2019s most prolific character actors) and the much-loved Margaret Rutherford. Patch and Vedey make a dynamic double-act whose clowning keeps the film zipping along, while Rutherford\u2019s imperious proclamations on etiquette are priceless. Irene Handl adds some ooh-la-la to the role of a French maid, and director Carstairs ably keeps them all under control.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Hazel Terry (Hermione Blakiston)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
