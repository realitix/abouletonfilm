The most effective workout is the one you actually DO! So motivation is the key, and music is one of the best motivators. Great music makes your workout more fun and keeps you exercising because you LOOK FORWARD to it. That's why Leslie created WALK TO THE HITS.  Walk to the Hits features hit music and High Intensity Interval Training (aka HIIT) it's the perfect combination! Hit music pumps up your pace, and HIIT training alternates between bursts of all out effort and periods of recovery, allowing you to walk a shorter session and blast away as many calories as you would in a longer one.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rBckuaoBFZt3gjGXKG8FEUfWnL8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
