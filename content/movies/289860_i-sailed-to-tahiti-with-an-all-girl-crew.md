The fun begins when one bets the other $20,000 that he, with an all girl crew, be the first to Tahiti in a sailboat race. The other, not to be outdone, has a few monkeyshines up his sleeve and actually wins the race. The beaten bettor then makes the claim, that he can beat the victor to the mainland using a crew comprised of baboons. That is too much to resist for the other and the race is on.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nw16xwstsPi07D3jLlqfqcUYfZx.jpg", "actors": ["Gardner McKay (Terry O'Brien)", "Fred Clark ('Generous' Josh)", "Diane McBain (Liz Clark)", "Pat Buttram (Blodgett)", "Richard Denning (Commodore)", "Edy Williams (Marilyn)", "Mary O'Brien (Jimsy)", "Jeanne Rainer (Monique)", "Bebe Louie (Tomaya)", "Arlene Charles (Janet)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [89998], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
