This short experimental film focuses on a kinetic sculpture by Zdenek Pe\u0161\u00e1nek. For a period of eight years it issued beams of light from the outside wall of a transformer station at Prague\u2019s power utility before its destruction in 1939. Though genuine, these shots seem abstract to us. They are a rhythmically assembled ode to the light-creating devices and phenomena of electricity. Light arcs, coils, bulbs and various luminous elements support the alternation of positive and negative film images, creating an impressive universe of light and shade. In the 1920s, Pe\u0161\u00e1nek had obtained financial support for his work with electric kinetic light art. In the 1930s, he was the first sculptor to use neon lights. He built several kinetic light pianos, and published a book titled \u201cKinetismus\u201d in 1941.  \u2014http://www.centerforvisualmusic.org", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jyrjgWS9VBT2E5V5G5mPcHnmKYi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [266089, 162746, 45976], "youtube_key": "SOAcNXnbEIo"}
