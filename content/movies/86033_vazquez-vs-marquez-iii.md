Like the second match between the two (in 2007), this one won the title of \u201cFight of the Year\u201d (by Ring Magazine), even if for example we have preferred the fight between Casamayor and Katsidis or other 5-star fights of 2008. Rafael Marquez knocked down Vazquez in the fourth round but at the end of this balanced and spectacular fight the winner is \u201cMagnifico\u201d Vazquez.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b1qLrEesv23lToB7udxv4onkhvT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
