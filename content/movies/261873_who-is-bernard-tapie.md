Politicians, athletes, friends, companions, and journalists comment on Bernard's charm, his rise to prominence in sports and politics, and his subsequent trouble with the law. Zenovich becomes fixated on her need to interview Tapie, becoming virtually a stalker in her quest.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Marina Zenovich (Herself)", "Bernard Tapie (Himself)", "Claude Lelouch (Himself)", "Anne-Laure Plante (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
