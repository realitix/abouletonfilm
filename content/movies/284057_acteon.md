Based on the myth from Ovid's Metamorphoses in which Acte\u00f3n accidentally catches a glimpse of Diana, the goddess of love, and is subsequently turned into a deer for his dogs to devour, Jorge Grau's modernist retelling resets the story to contemporary Spain, where a fisherman \u2013 played by Martin LaSalle, star of Bresson's Pickpocket \u2013 follows an enchanting, flirtatious stranger into the city.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dEVay88S3sV9W05TPSRS5B5bmyA.jpg", "actors": ["Martin LaSalle ()", "Pilar Clemens ()", "Juan Luis Galiardo ()", "Claudia Gravy ()", "Iv\u00e1n Tubau ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
