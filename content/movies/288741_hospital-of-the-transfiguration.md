But this is an unusual hospital: there are several incurable schizophrenic cases, staff is bit strange and a writer has voluntarily entered the clinic because he is \"peculiar\" and a drug addict. Then the German Gestapo arrives. The commandant asks for the list of patients, sorts out the \"Aryan\" doctors from the others on a return trip, and herds everyone into trucks for evacuation to the extermination camps. A young doctor momentarily escapes by covering himself under a pile of laundry in the basement, and then escapes to the woods just as the Nazi soldiers appear.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2LHTaROaHC4cPpqvKCqubXbWmmX.jpg", "actors": ["Piotr Dejmek ()", "Jerzy Bi\u0144czycki ()", "Henryk Bista ()", "Ewa Dalkowska (Dr. Nosilewska)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
