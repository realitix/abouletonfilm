Its location in present-day China is roughly at Hongmenbao Village, Xinfeng Town, Lintong District, Xi'an, Shaanxi province. The main parties involved in the banquet were Liu Bang and Xiang Yu, two prominent leaders of insurgent forces who rebelled against the Qin dynasty from 209\u2013206 BC. The event was one of the highlights of the Chu\u2013Han Contention, a power struggle for supremacy over China between Liu Bang and Xiang Yu which concluded with Xiang Yu's defeat and the establishment of the Han dynasty with Liu Bang as its first emperor. The Feast at Hong Gate is often memorialised in Chinese history, fiction and popular culture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kzFtwrT34TItv8lPBSf5MdPplAI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
