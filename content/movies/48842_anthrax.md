A reporter encourages the angry ranchers - led by the Mountie's mother-in-law - to stage a sit-in at the research center. When an eccentric old rancher dies after being exposed to a deadly strain of anthrax, the protesters are quarantined. No one notices that the reporter has disappeared - along with several vials of the deadly bacteria. The RCMP officer begins his own investigation, gleaning information from a U.S. government agent. He finds himself racing against time to recover the stolen anthrax.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kktOrI03FGRxX2OB7IacU8LicEw.jpg", "actors": ["Cameron Daddo (Sgt.
