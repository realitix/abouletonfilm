The workshop covered the earthworks for building a pond without a liner, a swale, and a hugelkultur bed on a terrace. Then we added more footage by doing the same workshop over again in a colder climate.  A year later, we returned to the first workshop site and added even more footage! We even had an evaluation by the Crown Prince of Permaculture, Geoff Lawton.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ecxRiRzU01wUHeeqWJczqxKLWD3.jpg", "actors": ["Paul Wheaton (Himself)", "Geoff Lawton (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
