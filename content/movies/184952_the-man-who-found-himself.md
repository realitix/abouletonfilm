When it is discovered that a passenger killed in a plane that Jim crashes was a married woman, the resulting scandal prompts the hospital to put Jim on probation. His pride wounded, Jim takes to the open road and enjoys the simpler life of a vagabond. In Los Angeles--where he is arrested for vagrancy and put to work on a road crew--Jim runs into old pal Dick Miller, who gets him a job as a mechanic for Roberts Aviation. But maintaining his anonymity becomes more difficult, particularly when a pretty nurse, Doris King, decides to make Jim's redemption her personal crusade.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sBNvtF88SiMpZ57GxqBCfbg5MV8.jpg", "actors": ["John Beal (Dr. James Stanton Jr.)", "Joan Fontaine (Doris King)", "Phillip Huston (Richard Miller)", "Jane Walsh (Barbara Reed)", "George Irving (Dr. James Stanton Sr.)", "Jimmy Conlin (Nosey Watson)", "Frank M.
