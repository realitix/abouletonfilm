New York hadn't seen anything like this since the Nova Convention in 1978 which saw Frank Zappa, Patti Smith and others anoint William Burroughs as king of the counterculture. A quarter century later Disinformation's keynote speakers Richard Metzger and Douglas Rushkoff ushered in a dizzying, day-long array of performances ranging from sword-swallowing to sanskrit chanting, interspersed with lectures and conversations with counterculture luminaries like Mondo 2000 founder R.U. Sirius, industrial music progenitor Genesis P-Orridge, Grant Morrison, Robert Anton Wilson, theorists, performance artists and others from the extremes of popular culture. Nothing beats actually experiencing an event like this in the flesh, but this DVD comes pretty close to capturing the spirit of the counterculture as we lurch into the 21st century.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v6wdoxq52H9YhrFshZRaCNPRlpH.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Metzger (Himself)", "Douglas Rushkoff (Himself)", "Grant Morrison (Himself)", "Robert Anton Wilson (Himself)", "Mark Pesce (Himself)", "Marilyn Manson (Himself)", "Joe Coleman (Himself)", "Kenneth Anger (Himself)", "Adam Parfrey (Himself)", "Kembra Pfahler (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
