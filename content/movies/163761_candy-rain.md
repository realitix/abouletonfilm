They sleep together and bask in each other's company, but minor differences get in the way of a smooth ride to happily ever after, leading to an inevitable break up and a possible make up. Story two centers on an OCD-suffering introvert (Sandrine Pinna) who works as a chef and meets possible partners online. Her new girl is a forward older woman (Waa, doing her best Bai Ling impression), and the two manage some semblance of relationship progression before clashing personalities - and one partner's irrational need for loneliness - gets in the way of extended bliss.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/RqZjaHUTPwJez5eRs43XO7JI01.jpg", "actors": ["Mok Chi-Yee (Summer's Husband)", "Karena Lam (Ricky)", "Sandrine Pinna (U)", "Yang-kun Chen (Pon)", "Belle Hsin (Jessie)", "An-an Hsu (Ricky's Ex-Girlfriend)", "Iling Kao (Summer)", "Xinling Wang (Ricky's Ex-Girlfriend)", "Waa Wei (Lin)", "Niki Wu (Spancer)", "Jozie Lu (Ricky's Ex-Girlfriend)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
