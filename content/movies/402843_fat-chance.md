Child therapist by day and blues singer by night, Rick's charisma and talent are undeniable, yet he remains fixed within the definition of a narrow label. The film takes on appearance-based oppression and fat-shaming by examining the ways in which society treats people whose bodies don\u2019t necessarily match a narrow, unrealistic ideal of attractiveness. Instead of losing weight, Rick gains valuable insight, transformative new friendships, and a profound sense of self-confidence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zMaSX5AIIYTk1VY6arOenlzaQiB.jpg", "actors": ["Rick Zakowich ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
