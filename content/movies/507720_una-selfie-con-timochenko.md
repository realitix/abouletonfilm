The problem is that Juan Pablo is not even invited to the big event, so he decides to dismantle it by taking it to Rwanda to learn more about the process of reconciliation between Hutus and Tutsis and return to the country in time for the signing and thus achieve, not only in the official photo but \"lag\" a selfie with Timochenko. That will surely make Natalia fall exhausted to the wheels of her chair.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4jOgbzfWQyeuI9izRhHSr8ZGRAQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
