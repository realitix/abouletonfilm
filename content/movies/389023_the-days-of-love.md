Rebellions and revolutions had followed one after the other for decades. Though things were beginning to settle down some, it was still a time when one had the feeling that anything could happen. This film tells the story of one boy's sexual coming-of-age during that time, punctuated by a peasant rebellion sparked by religious concerns (Catholicism had been officially suppressed). The lad has a crush on the wife of the Army man sent to put down the rebellion. He also has an affair with a local woman and briefly runs away with a pretty young prostitute.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7ZH3CG5zhDMxVIzMaRWPB5y0jSK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
