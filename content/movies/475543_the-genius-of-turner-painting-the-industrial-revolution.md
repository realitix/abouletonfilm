There is more to Turner than his sublime landscapes - he also painted machines, science, technology and industry. Turner's life spans the Industrial Revolution, he witnessed it as it unfolded and he painted it. In the process he created a whole new kind of art. The programme examines nine key Turner paintings and shows how we should re-think them in the light of the scientific and Industrial Revolution. Includes interviews with historian Simon Schama and artist Tracey Emin.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hwE22dR2rFNpLJbotiXsQ6SLWjU.jpg", "actors": ["Simon Schama (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
