Using an intriguing mixture of statistics, humor, insight and outrage, Jean Kilbourne questions how far the use and abuse of women in advertising is connected to the sexual exploitation of women at large and the increasing incidence of child abuse.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oY0AoZExiRkJoz0bsg3dFjy6InQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
