Sidney Poitier stars as Jack Parks, a trucking executive who runs an illegal travelling casino out of one of his vehicles. Abbey Lincoln co-stars as Ivy Moore, the much-valued maid of the white Austin household. To make sure that Ivy won't quit her job, Frank Austin (Carroll O'Connor) blackmails Poitier into romancing her. He eventually falls in love with Ivy for real, but not before she's discovered that he's little more than a \"hired hand\" in affairs of the heart. Beau Bridges costars as amiable hippie Tim Austin, the only truly likeable member of his snooty, upper-crust clan. Robert Alan Aurthur based his screenplay on an original story by star Sidney Poiter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fUZ0xO8Sqw9kR2NpfXBXbTRP5bb.jpg", "actors": ["Sidney Poitier (Jack Parks)", "Abbey Lincoln (Ivy Moore)", "Beau Bridges (Tim Austin)", "Nan Martin (Doris Austin)", "Lauri Peters (Gena Austin)", "Carroll O'Connor (Frank Austin)", "Leon Bibb (Billy Talbot)", "Hugh Hurd (Jerry)", "Lon Satton (Harry)", "Stanley Greene (Eddie)", "Paul Harris (Dealer)", "Tony Major (Dealer)", "Clark Morgan (Dealer)", "Christopher St. John (Dealer)", "Bob Carey (Dealer)", "Marlene Clark (Radio Phone Girl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
