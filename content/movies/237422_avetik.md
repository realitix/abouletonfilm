In sensuous, lyric styling, Askarian employs dreamlike images to reflect the history of his homeland, tranquil childhood memories, images inspired by erotic medieval poetry, and autobiographical shades of his own exile in Germany.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cyc8sQev5snP1IrqbsmYylGhQss.jpg", "actors": ["Alik Asatryan (Avetik)", "Mikhail Stepanyan (Young Avetik)", "Karen Dzhanibekyan (Refugee)", "Eduard Saribekyan (Kuchak)", "Samvel Ovazaryan (Armenian King)", "Geno Lechner (Journalist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
