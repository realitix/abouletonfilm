Even more painful is that the love of his life, one of his ex-students, reveals herself to be a gifted artist. To some she\u2019s even considered to be the true successor to Benavidez\u2019s father. It\u2019s no wonder that this creates tensions and after a devastating lovers quarrel, Benavidez puts all his artworks into a big case and, having nowhere else to go, drags it to his shrink. The man specializes in treating creative spirits and even has an artist\u2019s colony in the basement of his huge mansion. As part of their therapy, his patients produce artworks that get sold for lucrative prizes at auctions organized by the psychiatrist himself. When he looks at what\u2019s inside the case of Benavidez, he realizes that the son has finally surpassed his father.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4obyOERYjtJNRSnEtxRy9AORitf.jpg", "actors": ["Guillermo Pfening ()", "Jorge Marrale ()", "Norma Aleandro ()", "Paula Brasca ()", "Pablo Guisa Koestinger ()", "Valent\u00edn Javier Diment ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
