Upon the release from an insane asylum, the sisters embark on a relentless search for the guys that raped and strangled their sister. Obsessed with revenge and fueled by a hatred of all men, they kill any man that crosses their path, retaining his severed genitals as a trophy. Co-director Jacelone liked the story so much that he also directed a higher-budgeted remake, which was filmed in 1996-97 and released in 1998.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vqaOpRZtQxqrtJQDEZE9GI7LNBE.jpg", "actors": ["Pamela Sutch (Jackie Sicole)", "Christine Taylor (Jane Sicole)", "Tina Krause (Janice Sicole)", "Peter Kerr (Jack the Rapist)", "Chris Monroe (Jack's Buddy #1)", "Joe Isabella (Jack's Buddy #2)", "Laura Giglio (The Newscaster)", "Clancey McCauley (Girl on TV #1)", "Terri Lewandowski (Girl on TV #2 (as Launa Kane))", "Gary Whitson (The Guy Next Door)", "Dave Castiglione (Fraternity Boy)", "Pete Jacelone (Dr. Lawrence)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
