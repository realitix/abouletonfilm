Beauty returns to her home town of Beaufort West, deep in the heart of the surreal landscape of the Karoo semi-desert and quickly learns that this case is not as simple as she thought. The real culprit of this accidental murder is a painfully shy young woman named Natalie who flees her small, rural town on horseback and teams up with her now pregnant childhood friend Poppie to outrun the law. Flatland is a journey of self-discovery for these three different but equally desperate women, painting a vivid and unique portrait of femininity against a hostile frontier-land and questions what it means to be a women in contemporary South Africa and the world at large.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fNnnh4MvtWQqFTSWJlQczCDgNwS.jpg", "actors": ["Nicole Fortuin (Natalie Jonkers)", "De Klerk Oelofse (Bakkies Bezhuidenhout)", "S\u00e1rk\u00f6zi Oliv\u00e9r (Arnoux)", "Unikitty (Diani)", "Mahon Andoniaina (Kevin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
