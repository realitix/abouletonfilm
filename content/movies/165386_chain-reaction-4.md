With this installment of the Chain Reaction series, we feature the usual cast of characters as well as introduce a few new names that will blow your mind. There is nothing outside the limits of what is rideable! Chain Reaction 4 features the most in depth event coverage you will find of the Red Bull Rampage, the NORBA race series, the Rye Airfield Big Wheels skatepark comp and the Boston Bike Battle. You will also shred streets, parks and jumps with Aaron Chase, Jeff Lenosky, Lars Tribus, Kyle Ebbett, Shaums March, Todd Bosch and new comer Eric Porter. The DH Productions crew and three time Emmy Award winning producer director Don Hampton, will throw you in the saddle for one killer ride!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6z9WYjHESfzGr86PdDuR7vZroX5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
