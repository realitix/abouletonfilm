Carey is cast as Jack Marian, a gambler with an unsavory past. Suspected of being an outlaw, Carey plays along with this misconception, the better to infiltrate a gang of smugglers. Along the way, he clears the name of the brother of Texas ranger Mike Donovan, and helps patch up the romance between Donovan and heroine Mary Jane Irving. Among the supporting players are Gibson Gowland, previously the star of Erich Von Stroheim's silent classic Greed, and the \"ever popular\" Mae Busch, taking a break from her usual duties in the Laurel and Hardy comedies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ytlzssmr2DCwFJBiuacWUSofalE.jpg", "actors": ["Harry Carey (Pete Marlan)", "Mae Busch (Mary Ryan)", "Gibson Gowland (Mike Donovan)", "Mary Jane Irving (Bernice Donovan)", "Ed Brady (Lopez Venero)", "Jack Richardson (Steve Henderson)", "Tom London ('Sholt' Fletcher)", "Lafe McKee (Ranger Captain Frank Henderson)", "Lee Sage (Jack Marlan, Texas Ranger)", "Ed Jones (Mac McLain - Texas Ranger)", "Maston Williams (Jim Bowman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
