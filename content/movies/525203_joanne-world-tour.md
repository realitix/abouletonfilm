It began on August 1, 2017, in Vancouver, Canada and ended on February 1, 2018, in Birmingham, England.  After tickets went on sale, various shows in Europe and North America quickly sold out, prompting additional dates in both continents. The concert series was deemed \"more minimalist\" in comparison to the singer's previous tours, but received praise for the visuals, Gaga's singing abilities and her connection with the audience.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x42TO9Ps50TnNplQUgeypNOH2iE.jpg", "actors": ["Lady Gaga (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [283830, 63513, 472424, 376570], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
