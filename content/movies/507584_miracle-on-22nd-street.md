In 2010, what had been a trickle turned into a tide, with Glaub and Parker receiving more than 400 letters\u2014many from children who pleaded with Santa to give them the Christmas their parents couldn\u2019t afford. Filmmaker Sarah Klein (co-founder of the production house Redglass Pictures with Tom Mason) found out about the letters, and followed Glaub and Parker\u2019s efforts to turn a freak occurrence into an opportunity to spread holiday cheer.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
