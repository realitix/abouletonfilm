Since 2002 the international community has injected more than a trillion dollars into Afghanistan. What went wrong? This film examines the counter insurgency/ culture campaign that the US government [and others] waged. Told through the eyes of Afghan youth, who start the country's first ever heavy metal band and an adventurous Australian, who created a Western style music scene in the capital - Kabul. Will head banging, disenchanted Afghans win the hearts and minds of their peers or will the Taliban come back from the grave?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/an2uGY3A7sgb5fOVnTs7fPIQM4q.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "251125741"}
