Rare archival material and interviews reveal the emotional pain and harmful effects of a closeted life, the relief of coming out and the triumph of love through the Congressman's historic same-sex marriage. Frank's journey is our country's journey, a classic American story about a dedicated public servant who never loses hope.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/v6djWxpSfJbxB2adGjLdopIi8V0.jpg", "actors": ["Barney Frank (Himself)", "Spencer Bachus (Himself)", "Mike Barnicle (Himself)", "Neil Barofsky (Himself)", "Dustin Lance Black (Himself)", "Steve Elmendorf (Himself)", "Charles Halpern (Himself)", "Susan Halpern (Herself)", "Bethany McLean (Herself)", "Norman Ornstein (Himself)", "Michael Oxley (Himself)", "Henry Paulson (Himself)", "Nancy Pelosi (Herself)", "Bill Press (Himself)", "Jim Ready (Himself)", "Jim Segel (Himself)", "Eliot Spitzer (Himself)", "Andrew Tobias (Himself)", "Maxine Waters (Herself)", "Chuck Wolfe (Himself)", "Hastings Wyman (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [41475], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
