In this program, Barney, Guggenheim curator Nancy Spector, and others deconstruct the Cycle\u2019s filming and subsequent translation into sculptural installations. The locations, characters, and symbols that organize the Cycle films; the Cycle installations as spatial content carriers and extensions of the performances; and objectification of the body and undifferentiated sexuality are addressed, as are the intricacies of costuming, makeup, and sculpting with Barney\u2019s signature materials: plastic, metal, and Vaseline.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fA6tvlNtOJ4c8ds6ouGEgLs5pdl.jpg", "actors": ["Matthew Barney (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
