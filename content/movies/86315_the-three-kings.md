Dressed as the Three Wise Men for a Christmas pageant, the trio is suddenly struck with the delusion that they are really their Biblical counterparts. As TV cameras grind away, the three ersatz Kings ride out of the Pageant--on camels--and into the mean streets of LA. As the story draws to its conclusion, the three escapees find themselves providing Christmas cheer for a group of homeless people on the outskirts of the city. Aaron Spelling's original story veers dangerously close to being devoured by its own cuteness at times, but Stirling Silliphant's script for Three Kings keeps the whimsy in check and the sillier events reasonably credible.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1PMnS9iTs0tU7chn0VoNMnYi2n7.jpg", "actors": ["Tiana Alexandra (Jan DuLong)", "Jane Kaczmarek (Dr. Paula Bolet)", "Richard Partlow (Police Officer)", "Lou Diamond Phillips (Tag)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
