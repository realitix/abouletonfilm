The house is historic and apparently haunted; at least, Sarah is disturbed during the night by a woman's crying but initially supposes someone else has double-booked. But next morning there is no sign of her. Tom, meanwhile, is haunted by his memories from a year before. Eventually, they both leave for an empty flat on the coast nearby, where Tom's relationship ended. Sarah begins to fall for Tom, but Tom has now - belatedly - fallen for his ex, and finally makes up for his fatal infidelity with her.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
