He has no choice. It's his living. With what he earns selling his body and by working in a restaurant and in subway tunnels, he just about makes ends meet. Coming home to his wife Marie and his infant child, he\u2019s an impotent wreck -- and definitely unable to afford the earrings he sees Marie wearing one day. She\u2019s frustrated and the jewelry is a gift from the local pimp. Woyzeck wasn't supposed to find out. But he has. Plagued by voices, he loses his already weak grip on reality. He retreats into the tunnels with Marie and the baby. There Woyzeck is the master of life and death.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ooFmrahcE9L3YCguQGapDfgPp0D.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Schilling (Woyzeck)", "Nora von Waldst\u00e4tten (Marie)", "Simon Kirsch (Tambourmajor)", "Julischka Eichel (Margreth)", "Christoph Franken (Andres)", "Markus Tomczyk (Louis)", "Gunnar Teuber (Doktor)", "Georgios Tsivanoglou (Hauptmann)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
