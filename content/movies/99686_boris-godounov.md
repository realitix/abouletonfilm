With a score conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich, Zulawski adds extra layers of devilish meta-textual embellishment by composing the film\u2019s imagery as though we are watching a theater piece of a film crew making a movie about the opera of \u201cBoris Godounov\u201d! As well, the picture is full of delightful anachronisms that mock the then-contemporary Russian government, alongside jabs at other 20th-century dictatorships. So incensed was Rostropovich by Zulawski\u2019s juiced final product \u2014 one that took liberties with the narrative\u2019s sexual thrust, amongst other things \u2014 that he (unsucessfully) took Zulawski to court for \u201cthe violation of the Russian soul\u201d! \u201cImpressive in its use of whirling camera movements as well as mega close-ups of the contracted faces of its singers, \u2018Boris Godounov\u2019 is one of the most original opera movies ever made\u201d", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xtwZEGU8rUj0rdUHwddzfTRXXl2.jpg", "actors": ["Ruggero Raimondi (Boris Godounov)", "Kenneth Riegel (Le prince Chouisky)", "Pavel Slab\u00fd (Le moine Grigori (le faux Dimitri) / L'innocent)", "Wyatscheslaw Polozov (Grigory (voice))", "Bernard Lefort (Pim\u00e8ne)", "Paul Plishka (Pim\u00e8ne (voice))", "Delphine Forest (Marina Mnichek)", "Galina Vishnevskaya (Marina Mnichek / L'aubergiste (voice))", "Anne-Marie Pisani (L'aubergiste)", "Nikita Storojew (Rangoni (voice))", "Romuald Tesarowicz (Varlaam)", "Nicolai Gedda (L'innocent (voice))", "Kaline Carr (Xenia (as Caroline Carr))", "Catherine Dubosc (Xenia (voice))", "Mahew Adam Fish (Fyodor (voice))", "Lajos Miller (Andrej Scelkalov (voice))", "Richard Cowan ()", "Zoran Cvijanovi\u0107 ()", "Vladan Dujovi\u0107 ()", "Dragomir Felba ()", "Vuka\u0161in Savi\u0107 (Andrej Scelkalov)", "Branislav Zeremski ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
