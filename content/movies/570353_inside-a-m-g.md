Questions arise as to where these young men come from, how they are recruited, what it is like to work for A.M.G., and if all the young men who apply and are accepted are, indeed, gay.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1ftD8JGEDRRhh0bJRx4t5c6t3gR.jpg", "actors": ["Rick Cassidy (Himself)", "Bob Mizer (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
