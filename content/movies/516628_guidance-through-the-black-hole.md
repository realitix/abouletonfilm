Drinking and gambling with his eastern european friends has left him estranged from his family and, even though he is surrounded with people, he feels utterly alone. His one consolation is his dream of one day returning to his beloved place of birth. But when his best friend dies, Sule is thrown into crisis. Suddenly confronted with his own mortality, Sule gets one last chance to turn things around when the Bosnian embassy invites him to exhibit a series of paintings entitled Guidance Through the Black Hole. The date for the exhibition is set, but the paintings are still not finished and Sule knows that if he is to succeed he must first overcome his vices. The question is: can Sule escape his dark past and find a way out of the black hole that he is creating on his canvases?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fgdzHoD9mTrWV5uA04JIaRJ8TqB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
