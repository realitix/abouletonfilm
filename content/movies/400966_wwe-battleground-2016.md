Sasha and Charlotte were a little ragged but I enjoyed the match. Another classic from KO & Zayn while i'm getting tired of seeing this match it's always good. Zayn nearly falls on his head doing that flip off the ropes. He recovers suplexing Owens on the apron. Lots of big spots bullfrog, a cannonball, double modified exploder suplexs, pop up powerbomb, double regular exploders and double helluva kicks. Fantastic Match!\r\nEnzo & Cass are absolutely on fire right now. They don't even need Cena. Parts of this match are really good and others not so good. The triple threat had it's moments not bad."}], "recommandations_id": [401727], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
