That's not Brittany Snow in the lead?**\r\n\r\nI watched the film today and the whole time I saw it I thought it was Brittany Snow with dyed hair... But it turns out it was someone named Shantel VanShanten.\r\n\r\nAnyhow the movie is a little all over the place quite often, the main story could have made for a pretty good flick but it wasn't executed as good as it could have been. That said it did manage to keep the mystery going rather well, there was a couple ways it could have ended up and wasn't really sure what was what until the end. So yeah kudos on that at least.\r\n\r\nAnd despite the flaws I was never bored or anything and it was visually pleasing and probably will watch it again at some point so yeah, definitly not a complete disaster."}], "recommandations_id": [207271, 34734, 306307, 384216]}
