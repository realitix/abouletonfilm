The president of the Japanese railroads is found dead during a period in which train service is plagued by numerous layoffs, strikes and shutdowns. The government says that the president was murdered; the police claim it was a suicide. A quizzical reporter follows the case for years, but the basic question remains unanswered: was the victim killed by members of the burgeoning Communist movement in Japan, or was the death stage-managed by the authorities in hopes of discrediting the Communists?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qqCdqENWZ4xKWeYHKd7BcdFsZHF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
