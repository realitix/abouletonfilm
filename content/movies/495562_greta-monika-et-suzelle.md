A rich man asks them to stay at his mansion and performs in a play he has written. This turns out to be hard core and they leave, but their bus breaks down. After Jacques sends his daughter to seduce a mechanic from the next village to repair it and two other girls lead the mechanic off into the woods for a threesome to avoid paying, they return to the mansion and do the play. Jacques' daughter marries the rich man and there is a wedding party orgy on the bus.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1CbuvmLpA9215nDDomodMYnu3qb.jpg", "actors": ["Dominique Saint Claire (Mado)", "Mika Barthel (Mika Barthel)", "Catherine Ringer (Une partouzeuse)", "Jack Gatteau (Le directeur)", "Carmelo Petix (Le comte)", "Guy B\u00e9rardant (Un partouzeur)", "Flore Sollier (Une com\u00e9dienne de la troupe)", "Brigitte Lelaurain (Une com\u00e9dienne de la troupe)", "Thierry de Brem (Nicolas, le r\u00e9gisseur)", "Cyril Val (Matamore Percecul, le garagiste)", "Christine Lodes (Une com\u00e9dienne de la troupe)", "Patrick Couter (Un com\u00e9dien de la troupe)", "Jo\u00ebl Charvier (Un partouzeur)", "Marc Lebel (Un spectateur)", "Jacques Marbeuf (Jacques Marbeuf)", "Gilbert Servien (Un spectateur)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
