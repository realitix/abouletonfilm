Aging Tony Cammarano (Italo Celoro) is the patriarch of an organized crime family, but his son Amerigo (Toni Servillo) runs most of his operations. Amerigo is a killer who invites his mistress, Rita (Lucia Ragni), to live in the family house. Meanwhile, his wife, Irene (Licia Maglietta), has an affair with mob henchman Egidio (Antonino Iuorio), who fancies the Cammarano's teenage daughter, Orsola (Antonia Truppo). This leaves Irene to eye her own son, Oreste (Domenico Balsamo), who has taken to self-mutilation. Luna Rossa won the Wella Prize at the 2001 Venice Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7nzg9q8ZOgJBesvrOalreYDW1r0.jpg", "actors": ["Toni Servillo (Amerigo)", "Carlo Cecchi (Antonino)", "Domenico Balsamo (Oreste)", "Licia Maglietta (Irene)", "Antonino Juorio (Egidio)", "Angela Pagano (Mariella)", "Italo Celoro ()", "Antonio Pennarella (Libero)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
