She's also got a thriving neighborhood business: for 50 cents, she'll keep your secret. Her mother is very pregnant, and her parents seem more concerned about the new baby than anything Emily cares about. A new family moves in next door; their son, Philip, 12, becomes Emily's friend. Eventually, the weight of Emily's secrets - her own, the ones she's keeping professionally, and a secret Philip tells her, send her life temporarily crashing down.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/we3yhDjvjFTqTkraF8poaJhugKa.jpg", "actors": ["Evan Rachel Wood (Emily Lindstrom)", "Michael Angarano (Philip)", "David Gallagher (David)", "Danielle C.
