After the war, Florian's reimbursement is challenged, and he must also pay taxes on his destroyed mill. He resists the tax collectors and takes off to Vienna, where he intends to defend his rights. On the way, he rescues the Duchess of Guastalla from assault. She also wants to go to Vienna, as His Majesty Franz II is trying to contest an heir in her favor. With cunning, luck, and dagger, Florian fights his way through a slew of nobility and their secret police.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4HEya8TSYIDKYSYTOUh41gHrd9I.jpg", "actors": ["Manfred Krug (Hauptmann Florian)", "Regina Beyer (Duchessa von Guastalla)", "Rolf Herricht (Amadeus)", "Rolf Hoppe (Polizeidirektor)", "Doris Abe\u00dfer (Nanderl)", "Eberhard Cohrs (Dorfgendarm)", "Herbert K\u00f6fer (Medicus)", "Maximilian Larsen (Zuckerb\u00e4cker)", "Gisela Bestehorn ()", "Jutta Kl\u00f6ppel ()", "Hans Hardt-Hardtloff ()", "Werner Lierck ()", "Wolf Sabo ()", "Carmen-Maja Antoni ()", "Peter Biele ()", "Karl-Ernst Sasse ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
