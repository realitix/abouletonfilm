Could he do it without Bill Gaither? Find out in Mark Lowry Goes to Hollywood. With a little help from a tremendous line-up of musical guests, Mark Lowry delivers a healthy dose of side-splitting comedy and a power-packed line-up of great music in this live video event. Mark forms his own \"Mark Lowry Vocal Band\" just for the occasion with Michael English, Reggie Smith, and Bill Gaither. Great performances by The Isaacs, LordSong, Stan Whitmire, and Karen Harding and the \"reMarkable Choir\" cap off the evening perfectly in this video event of a lifetime!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1W3gXO6zSeuMSQtCXkVzLj9PHDw.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Lowry ()", "Reggie Smith ()", "Michael English ()", "Bill Gaither ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "uQ2l-rnN_ms"}
