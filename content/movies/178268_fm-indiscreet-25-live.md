For the first time ever we played Indiscreet live in its entirety at shows which were unashamed nostalgia-fests.  It gives us great pleasure to now bring you the DVD - INDISCREET 25 LIVE. Filmed live at Manchester Academy 2 and London O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire on 9th and 10th March 2012, this DVD also features a documentary section in which we reflect on Indiscreet's place in FM history.  INDISCREET 25 LIVE is released via Riff City Records 01 April 2013 in PAL Region Free (0) format.
