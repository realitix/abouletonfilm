Each monster represents a letter of the alphabet, but should any of the monsters go missing for longer than a day, all the letters will be wiped clean from every book in Capital Town, so it's very important to make sure that all the ABC Monsters are safely back in Alphabet Gardens before the sun goes down. However, this isn't as easy as it sounds. The ABC Monsters are always curious and happy creatures so they tend to wander off from Alphabet Gardens and get lost in the process. In each adventure Alice and her good friends Brian and Cherry Berry, must search high and low for one of the missing monsters. In this DVD, embark on adventures to find the letters E, F, G, and H!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jAS4ZROn70WcwfhdhaRNQGCET8s.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
