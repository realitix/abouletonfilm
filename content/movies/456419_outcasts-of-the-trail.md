Hale stars as legendary lawman Pat Garrett, here winning the Fourth of July buckboard race in a small Nevada town against the unscrupulous Fred Smith (Ted Mapes) and pretty Lavinia White (Jeff Donnell). Lavinia blames Garrett for sending her pa, Ivory White (John Gallaudet), to jail for robbing 100,000 dollars. White, who has stashed the loot away someplace, is about to be released and plans to return the money to the express office for the sake of his children, Lavinia and Chad (Tommy Ivo). Nasty Jim Judd (Roy Barcroft), however, forces Lavinia to help him rob the coach carrying Ivory and the money, counting on the fact that White will keep quiet for his daughter's sake.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sENb8TwfYUnVFKtEzKVqMImG88Y.jpg", "actors": ["Monte Hale (Pat Garrett)", "Paul Hurst (Doc Meadowlark)", "Jeff Donnell (Vinnie White)", "Roy Barcroft (Jim Judd)", "John Gallaudet (Ivory White)", "Milton Parsons (Elias Dunkenscold)", "Tommy Ivo (Chad White)", "Minerva Urecal (Abbie Rysen)", "Ted Mapes (Fred Smith)", "George Lloyd (Horace Rysen (as George H.
