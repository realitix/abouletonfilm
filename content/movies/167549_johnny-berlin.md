Passengers on the Seattle to L.A. trip know him as \"Johnny Berlin\" - the man responsible for making their beds and cleaning their toilets. We get to know him differently - as a middle-aged, struggling writer with a workaday job and as many dreams as he has beds to clean. Boyishly charming and with many stories to tell, Johnny takes us on a trip through his life. He's a true wanderer, a man without a home base, whose only plan is to spend his savings on a trip to Cambodia to write his long-gestating novel. The film is ultimately an intimate, offbeat, and humorous portrait of mid-life crisis presented as a traveling monologue.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/foccbWSukudO1FAjxHPOhrh7CKi.jpg", "actors": ["Jon Hyrns ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
