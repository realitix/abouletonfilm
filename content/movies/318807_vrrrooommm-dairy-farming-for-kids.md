Later, children meet a newborn calf and visit a plant to see how cheese is made. Aimed at youngsters ages 2 to 10, the video teaches them about the realities of modern farming and the effort required to get food to market.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
