HAHAHAHAH. This takes you further, deeper and darker than that with officially licensed footage from Paris-Roubaix, Criterium du Dauphine and Liege-Bastogne-Liege. You\u2019ll be up against pro cyclists like Philippe Gilbert, Fabian Cancellara, Thor Hushovd and Bradley Wiggins. A Very Dark Place is about maximum effort for shorter durations: in this case, 4:00 intervals that take you to the limit.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
