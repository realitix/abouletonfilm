This gore-scarred, creature-fueled whodunnit culminates in one of the most rewarding slasher reveals in camcorder history, but the journey is every bit as powerful. Especially when the singer of coal-hearted gothpunk combo The Nuns stares directly into the camera and croons: \u201cYou SLIT your WRISTS. You fuckin\u2019 BITCH.\u201d A staggering celebration of drugs, fear and new wave rage, Night Feeder was completed at the tail end of San Francisco\u2019s robust post-punk era and was only ever released on PAL-format VHS in Poland. Featuring effects that rival Hollywood\u2019s best gore-monsterwork, it\u2019s a nasal, vicious battle cry and one of the best homemade horror films you\u2019ll ever see, hands down.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jRurA0EhCg8te6mArOaDiwMhBza.jpg", "actors": ["Kate Alexander (Jean Michaelson)", "Jonathan Zeichner (Inspector Alonzo Bernardo)", "Caleb Dreneaux (Bryan Soulfield)", "Cintra (Victoria)", "Robert Duncanson (Creeper)", "Lissa Zapardino (Marcia Hollingsworth)", "Jack Trask (Zac)", "Ginger Seeberg (Debbie)", "Robert Hogan (Coroner)", "Easy Willingham (David Michaelson)", "Al Millan (Monty)", "Howard Freiberg (Nick)", "Edward Hazzard (Jerry)", "Erik Swanson (Ted Hollingsworth)", "Michael Cawelti (Reporter)", "Roger J.
