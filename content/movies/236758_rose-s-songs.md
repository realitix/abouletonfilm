Yellow star, ghettos, Arrow Cross terror. The inhabitants of Hungary's capital, Budapest, await the tragic fulfilment of their fate with helpless resignation. However, above one of the city's villas, once a week in the evening the stars of hope sparkle, if only for a few minutes. This short time gives fresh heart to those hiding here and kindles hope in their tortured souls to live for another day. This mysterious power is none other than a beautiful song that can be heard at such times from the villa's tower room.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mDuBD3mKCkhQknJ2wDwn9m8EcIb.jpg", "actors": ["Franco Castellano (II) (G\u00e9za Hal\u00e1sz)", "David Zum (Tomi)", "Ildik\u00f3 B\u00e1ns\u00e1gi (Lili)", "\u0110oko Rosi\u0107 (Grandpa)", "Kati Patocskai (Julo)", "Petra V\u00e1radi (Zsuzso)", "\u00c9va T\u00edm\u00e1r (Vera)", "Maia Morgenstern (Olga)", "Zolt\u00e1n Gera (Mr. Waltz)", "\u00c1gi Margitai (Mrs. Waltz)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
