Their widowed father runs the family sake shop -- but is running into financial trouble (causing him to make some bad decisions). Meanwhile, his long-time mistress's little business is also on the rocks. Amidst this, the older sister is introduced to a well-off suitor (a university boy who is much more intrigued by the less traditional \"little sister\"). Add a dotty grandfather, an officious uncle and busy body neighbors.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pekCPUc8PPz5LIth2GYWR5E10zp.jpg", "actors": ["Sachiko Chiba (Kunie)", "Kamatari Fujiwara (Uncle)", "Toshiko It\u00f4 (Oyo)", "K\u00f4 Mihashi (Kenkichi)", "Heihachir\u00f4 \u00d4kawa (Shintaro)", "Y\u00f4 Shiomi (Keisaku)", "Ryuko Umezono (Kimiko)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
