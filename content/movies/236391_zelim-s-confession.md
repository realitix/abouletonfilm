This is precisely what happened to a young Chechen named Zelim. One early morning, he was arrested in his mother's house and held for five days at the police station for a crime he never committed. Despite being subjected to the most brutal forms of torture, he maintained his innocence, much to the cops' dismay. Zelim denied any wrongdoing until he was near death, and finally he can tell his story to director Natalia Mikhaylova. She accompanies him as he wanders around Oslo recalling these painful memories.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
