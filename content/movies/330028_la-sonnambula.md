It is a combination of tender and melancholic sentiments and of tragic and moving passion, in a natural uncontaminated and innocent atmosphere and humanity which clearly represent the artistic experience of the composer. The charming staging by Hugo de Ana, at the Teatro Lirico di Cagliari goes back to January 2007. Through fascinating tableaux vivants, references to 17th century Romantic painting and refined visual projections, it is a tribute to Luchino Visconti. Visconti produced the memorabile performance of Sonnambula in March at the Scala di Milano with the magnificant Maria Callas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s03cYwRqrIVhdPczDIQTF0wf4Fc.jpg", "actors": ["Eglise Gutierrez (Amina)", "Simone Alaimo (Il Conte Rodolfo)", "Gabriella Colecchia (Teresa)", "Antonino Siragusa (Elvino)", "Sandra Pastrana (Lisa)", "Gabriele Nani (Alessio)", "Max Ren\u00e9 Cosotti (Un notaio)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
