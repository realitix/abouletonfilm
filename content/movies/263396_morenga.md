Gottschalk (Jacques Breuer) and Wenstrup (Edwin Noel) are two German veterinarians who have settled in German Southwest Africa to tend to the needs of cattle ranchers. When a rebellion by a local dissident named Morenga (Ken Gampu) is brutally crushed by the Germans, the two vets get involved, at great risk to themselves, and offer help to the native revolutionaries. What follows is a sequence of battles and skirmishes that ultimately lead to Morenga seeking asylum in South Africa, where the ruling Brits are about as trustworthy as their German counterparts. Morenga was nominated for a Golden Bear award at the 1985 Berlin Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q7YOWDUYxzJfEMt554112JfiKd8.jpg", "actors": ["Jacques Breuer (Oberveterin\u00e4r Gottschalk)", "Edwin No\u00ebl (Unterveterin\u00e4r Wenstrup)", "Manfred Seipold (Hauptmann Hans von Koppy)", "Herbert Wei\u00dfbach (Oberst Berthold Deimling)", "Vernon Dobtcheff (Lohmann)", "Harry Riebauer (v.
