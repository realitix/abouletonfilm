The protagonist looks almost like Charlie Chaplain. He is given a chance to make films for the emperor. There are many scenes of people running on and off of movie screens, and in and out of old kinetiscope projectors. Some people might find this erratic, and tedious, but it helps project an idea of fantasy, or forgetting about ones problems, becoming engrossed in a film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nR3uNVfA1XEYvmCK1CnLEDKzVQK.jpg", "actors": ["Akbar Abdi (Malijak)", "Dariush Arjmand (Amir Kabir)", "Ezzatolah Entezami (Nassereddin Shah)", "Mehdi Hashemi (Akkas bashi)", "Mohamad Ali Keshavarz (Farrash bashi)", "Fatemah Motamed-Aria (Golnaar)", "Mahaya Petrossian (Soboli)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
