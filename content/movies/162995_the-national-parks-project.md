If the Group of Seven were an introduction to the landscape\u2019s majesty, National Parks Project is the next logical chapter. Fifty-two contemporary artists from across the country, whose talents are as diverse as the parks they set out to explore, used their surroundings as a source of inspiration to blend musical and cinematic skills into collaboratively crafted vignettes. Epic in its ambition to celebrate these locales during Parks Canada\u2019s centennial year, this omnibus film resonates with the knowledge that our unprotected land is more vulnerable than ever. Including films by Zacharius Kunuk, Peter Lynch, Sturla Gunnarsson and John Walker, and music by Sarah Harmer, Sam Roberts, Cadence Weapon and The Besnard Lakes, among many others, National Parks Project is a one-of-a-kind documentary experience.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6efhBxy13IPJYXvPpagCq0tzDOF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "QjLTBj1bVYc"}
