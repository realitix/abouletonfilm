The building is located in a middle-class area and has residents from many age groups and walks of life. Many of the tenants are much older, but there are also a few children about. In one apartment lives a large group of Polish construction workers, while a Yugoslavian woman and her huge family attempt to survive in their tiny flat. The episodic story of the lives of these and other tenants is framed by a visit from a civil servant from the Office of Statistics.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kR2ZJ0aseFExzZh2IOgKRX29OFD.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Meyer (Alfred Navratil)", "Bibiana Zeller (Frau Gerhartl)", "Nikolaus Paryla (Roland Wanecek)", "Wolfgang B\u00f6ck (Ernstl Freitag)", "Wolf Bachofner (Ferdinand Haslinger)", "Brigitte Kren (Rosi Freitag)", "Branko Samarovski (Herr Halbgebauer)", "Maresa H\u00f6rbiger (Frau Halbgebauer)", "Elisabeth Stiepl (Frau Morgenwind)", "Dunja Sowinetz (Fr\u00e4ulein Dorli)", "Josef Hendrichs (Onkel Wanecek)", "Rudi Schippel (Antal Zwokic)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
