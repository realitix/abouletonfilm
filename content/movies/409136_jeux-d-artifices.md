They change their apartment on the outskirts of the city into a photo-studio to make a living, and they are very devoted to it. The two seem to live like heavenly beings without connecting to the outside world. Their only contact with the exterior is through Jacques, a loyal friend, but he also cuts himself out of any social life. The sister and the brother then take to get in touch with the world by Mrs Jean, a friend of their deceased mother with whom Elisa takes courses of singing. They live in harmony until a young man, whom Elisa falls for, eventually leaves with Eric for the USA and left her brokenhearted alone in France.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lHUTX2xSERoxUvleLwmArFybvBq.jpg", "actors": ["Myriam David (Elisa)", "Ga\u00ebl Seguin (Eric)", "Ludovic Henry (Jacques)", "Andr\u00e9e Putman (Mme Jean)", "Claude Chabrol (Le p\u00e8re de Jacques)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
