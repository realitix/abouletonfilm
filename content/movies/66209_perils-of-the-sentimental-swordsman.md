The titanic team of director Chu Yuan and novelist Ku Lung wisely choose to give their hero a whole new, non-stop, cliffhanger-fraught adventure featuring a mystery swordsman, a sensual swordswoman, an imperial assassin, a Ghost Mansion, the Bat Island, a booby-trapped tunnel, double crosses, and secret missions. And there are no fewer than three martial arts choreographers on hand to guide the amazing mayhem.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kkxtHIf7NuAYCsj6jLc4Q8bF6lm.jpg", "actors": ["Ti Lung (General Chu Liu Hsiang)", "Dang Wai-Ho (Teacher Long Wu)", "Ku Kuan-Chung (Liu Chang Chieh)", "Lo Lieh (Xuanyuan Fourth Light)", "Choh Seung-Wan (The General)", "Tai Liang-Chun (Zhong Ling)", "Ku Feng (Old Hawk)", "Lau Siu-Kwan (Cousin)", "Yuen Tak (Chou Pai Lung)", "Cheng Miu (8th Prince)", "Kwan Fung (Lan Meng)", "Yeung Chi-Hing (Dugu Mei)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
