But when they meet again in present-day London things are definitely not the same. Karl is now Kim, a transsexual, and she has no desire to stir up the past while she's busy forging a neat and orderly new life. Prentice, on the other hand, has charm but is a social disaster stuck in a dead-end job. His main talent is for getting them both into trouble. Amid the squabbles, they start to fall in love. One night, Kim invites Prentice to a romantic dinner at her flat. Prentice, finding the seduction unexpectedly effective, freaks out. He proceeds to make a public display of both of them and winds up in court. Humiliated and angry, Kim runs away. Only she can save Prentice now, but will true love triumph for a new made woman and an aging punk?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fPbbhgKLq1CL6B9PMjzO99cRZJ3.jpg", "actors": ["Rupert Graves (Paul Prentice)", "Steven Mackintosh (Karl / Kim Foyle)", "Miriam Margolyes (Pamela)", "Charlotte Coleman (Alison)", "Saskia Reeves (Jean)", "Nisha Nayar (Angela)", "Neil Dudgeon (Neil Payne)", "Adrian Rawlins (Mike)", "Robert Pugh (CID Detective)", "Kevin Allen (Policeman)", "Gerard Horan (Police Sergeant)", "Phil Davis (Cabbie)", "Ian Dury (Bailiff)", "Robert Pugh (DS Cole)", "Kevin Allen (PC Alan)", "Rick Warden (PC Ken)", "Edward Tudor-Pole (Prosecuting Solicitor)", "Lia Williams (Defending Solicitor)", "Blake Ritson (Young Prentice)", "Stephen Walker (Young Karl)", "Graham Fellows (Dispatch Manager)", "Peter-Hugo Daly (Barry)", "Shend (Jim)", "Ruth Sheen (Nosy neighbour)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [47889, 31903, 16659, 27215], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
