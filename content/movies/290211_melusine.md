Stefan ends up saving the life of young Christine and becomes her fianc\u00e9e.  Christine, however, is Nora\u2019s daughter  (can\u2019t see where this is heading, huh?).  When Christine finds out that mom and her hubby-to-be had a rather intimate history, she takes a boat ride on a stormy lake.  But the prophecy of disaster associated with the bronze figure \u201cMelusine\u201d does not come to pass:  Stefan looks for Christine, finds her in one piece and stays with her.  Nora, for her part, decides incest might be a bad thing and gives up Stefan forever to go back to the man she divorced (hey, way to feel wanted!).  For some reason, the Nazis didn\u2019t like the plot\u2019s moral message and banned it after its completion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m0c70kQkqGcZvbSm3huyT3VKQcL.jpg", "actors": ["Olga Tschechowa (Nora)", "Siegfried Breuer (Stefan Brock)", "Angelika Hauff (Christine von Hardegg)", "Friedrich Domin (Professor von Hardegg)", "Klaus Pohl ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
