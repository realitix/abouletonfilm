Without the luxury of social media or even email, the women hand-wrote letters to all their past guests, inviting them to come enjoy the beautiful autumn scenery\u2014with a clambake and some local entertainment thrown in. Director Andrea Meyerson takes viewers on a fascinating 30-year journey, through archival footage and photos, interviews with celebrities and founders, and current events and performances, offering a historical\u2014and hysterical\u2014look at what a handful of innovative women can accomplish.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zt61h9OZiCopDdOOTq2mrGLm6a.jpg", "actors": ["Kate Clinton ()", "Suzanne Westenhoefer ()", "Jessica Kirson ()", "Karen Williams ()", "Vickie Shaw ()", "Mimi Gonzalez ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
