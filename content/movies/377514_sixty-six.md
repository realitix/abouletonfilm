With its complex superimpositions of imagery and music, and its range of tones and textures at once alluringly erotic and forebodingly sinister, the film is a hypnotic dream of 1960 and 1970s Pop. Elliptical tales of sunshine noir and classic Greek mythology are inhabited by comic book super heroes and characters from Portuguese foto romans who wander through midcentury modernist Los Angeles architectural photographs and landscapes from period magazines.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1VTSLQG3aUMWu9Pkm9w6HJ0h851.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
