The first Truckin' Havoc on DVD! Features over 220 heavyweight prangs from an extensive worldwide archive of 'big truck' track and desert racing, over 90% of which have not featured in any other crash programme.  Menu options take the viewer to his or her favourite category whilst every crash can be examined frame-by-frame using DVD technology.  Starring skilled drivers like the ex-Abba drummer, F1 driver Slim Borgudd and multi-European Champion Steve Parrish.  Great impulse buy for the 'let's-check-it-out-when-we-get-back-from-the-pub' brigade and kids of all ages.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hoVOAzYZ9MHpCpCIYYNUdl3iKHw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
