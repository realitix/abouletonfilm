Shots are presented in their original order and length. Sound comes from picture locations. This is part of a filmmaking and film curating project to make films of the 50 US states using 16mm. I've invited artists to make other states. The Utah film is a part of this body of work.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2eblmhAuzG6SXzwRhOY7JznGfsI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
