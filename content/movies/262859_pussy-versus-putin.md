{"tmdb_id": 262859, "title": "Pussy Versus Putin", "original_title": "Pussy Versus Putin", "slug_title": "pussy-versus-putin", "date": "2013-08-30", "genre": ["Documentaire / Musique"], "score": "5.0/10", "synopsis": "In 2012 two members of anarchistic female band Pussy Riot were sentenced to two years in a Mordovian labor camp for \"hooliganism motivated by religious hatred\". Russian film collective Gogol\u2019s Wives follow each step of the feminist punk band\u2019s battle against Putin including their first disruptive performances on a trolley bus, shooting a video about transparent elections, a controversial performance in a Red Square cathedral, and footage shot in a jail cell. Support comes from many corners including Madonna who painted the words \"Pussy Riot\" on her back and wore a balaclava during her Moscow show. The documentary portrays the grim state of present-day Russia, a country starkly divided between conservatism and anarchy. Pussy Riot believes that art has to be free and they're willing to take it to extremes. \"Pussycat made a mess in the house,\" they say, and the house is Russia. The filmmakers do not seek to moralize, they simply edit events and leave viewers to draw their own conclusions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bjGGvC6tWOoEucloIrY03t0zkhp.jpg", "actors": ["Mariya Alyokhina (Mariya Alyokhina)", "Nadezhda Tolokonnikova (Nadezhda Tolokonnikova)", "Pussy Riot ()", "Yekaterina Samutsevich ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
