Leonard Bernstein and Isaac Stern join the Yoi Yisrael Philharmonic Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, and the Tel Aviv Philharmonic Choir for stirring classical renditions by Mahler and Mendelssohn. The concert was recorded by Columbia records for release at a later date and accurately captured the live music in all its classic splendor. Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion sits proudly in the front row as the symphonies play to a capacity crowd. Scenes of the war, the Wailing Wall, schools and hospitals are also included as Bernstein and Stern tour the country and meet the people of Israel.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/99g0maoCH6qXD9TzPbbzE9JYva8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
