Gidal's short film was assembled round a recording of the voice of Mary Pat Leece, who worked at the London Filmmakers' Co-op in the mid-1970s, and later became a much loved lecturer at St Martins School of Art. She died suddenly in 1997. The film's rapid-fire montage of images and sounds encapsulates her politics, her Catholicism and her intellectual passion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8dzO1MGYUFBLZTLhW07eY9TgUSf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
