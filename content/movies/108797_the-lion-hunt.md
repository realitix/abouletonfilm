They observe zebras, ostrich and a hippopotamus, and catch a small monkey for a pet. During the night they are awakened by a lion which kills a small goat and then the hunters' horse. The hunters shoot the lion as it stands by the water on a beach. They discover another lion and shoot it also. The lions are gutted and skinned. The happy hunters sit and smoke cigarettes afterward.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iYqB4iiKWJm171UgfSFim1lkNCY.jpg", "actors": ["Viggo Larsen (Lion Hunter)", "Knud Lumbye (Lion Hunter)", "William Thomsen (African Guide)", "Axel Graatkj\u00e6r ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
