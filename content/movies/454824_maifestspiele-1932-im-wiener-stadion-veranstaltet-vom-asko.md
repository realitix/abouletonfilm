After the historical revue, numerous delegation marched into the stadium to demonstrate the power and unity of Austrian Social Democracy. This is often wrongly attributed to P\u00e1l Fej\u00f6s. Rather, it was directed by Stephan Hock. The confusion seems to arise from the film being included as a special feature of the \u00d6-Film / Edition Der Standard DVD release of Fej\u00f6s' Sonnenstrahl.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jDWfWeqtiNEB9c1dwC2tALj2RUB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
