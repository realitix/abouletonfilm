The silence of solstice holds them together. Before a ritualized meal they each tell a story. Their stories are ominous, yet, as in the first OOBIELAND film (INTRODUCTION TO OOBIELAND), they are incomplete. Earlier, the titular mother has passed on her powers to a young woman. At the close of the film, this young woman enters the farmhouse and, with final simplicity, restores the old order.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y9LGJSfUOBYBjG1jpUC0GUhqjWw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
