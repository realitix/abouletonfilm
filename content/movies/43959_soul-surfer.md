That and too many tanned brain-dead surf-douche supporting actors makes it very corny (And you want to bite your own arm off in frustration after 1 hr).\r\nBut the main actress makes a solid effort, which is worth it. Shoot the rest, and feed them to the sharks."}], "recommandations_id": [9266, 13374, 13499, 10115]}
