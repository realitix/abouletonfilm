The text is Paul McCartney\u2019s own. Its story draws on the events of his early life in Liverpool, the large port in the north of England which, with the emergence of The Beatles in the 1960\u2019s, attracted world-wide attention as a centre of pop culture. McCartney\u2019s birth in the city during wartime, his schooldays at the Liverpool Institute and youthful aspirations \u2013 these are the starting points for a work that poignantly and vividly articulates the hopes and joys and crises of life in the modern world. Liverpool Oratorio was commissioned by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society to celebrate its 150th anniversary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vWfO0kLBDLvrYgTKXNAHepUVtt8.jpg", "actors": ["Paul McCartney ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
