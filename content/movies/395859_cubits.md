The film is as much the making of animation as it is a paper model of a computer. The cube sheet, upon which the film is based, is so constructed that a horizontal cubic rotation and a diagonal pan yields a diagonal rotation. Combinations of these primary moves result in more complex rotations throughout this awe inspiring film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jp17SLem3s43epqzMBCRV2ZoFhW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
