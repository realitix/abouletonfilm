A glamorous 81-year-old, Doris Payne is as unapologetic today about the nearly $2 million in jewels shes stolen over a 60-year career as she was the day she stole her first carat. With Payne now on trial for the theft of a department store diamond ring, filmmakers Kirk Marcolina and Matthew Pond probe beneath her consummate smile to uncover the secrets of her trade and what drove her to a life of crime. Stylish recreations, an extensive archive and candid interviews reveal how Payne managed to jet-set her way into any Cartier or Tiffanys from Monte Carlo to Japan and walk out with small fortunes. This sensational portrait exposes a rebel who defies societys prejudices and pinches her own version of the American Dream while she steals your heart.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9q4dEsseVwmK0idJqdP9898fILw.jpg", "actors": ["Doris Payne (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "yhnlcEhKZ-k"}
