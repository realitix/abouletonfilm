How is she so qualified? Because she\u2019s has never been depressed herself. Really! She even says that any autobiographical reference she makes to having been depressed is totally fictional. After all, what Chinese American family isn\u2019t perfect? Certainly not the Wongs! Irreverent, clever, and insanely meta-theatrical, Wong\u2019s attempts at playing savior unravel faster than the nest of yarn she\u2019s perched on. She descends quickly into the divide between Asian porn stars and the impossibly perfect. Along the way she becomes a hysterical living commentary on the cultural and societal pressures that may be creating depression in the first place.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
