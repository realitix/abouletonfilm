He has neither money, nor family, no constant job. He wanders about cities in search of a sole and unique girl, whom he would marry, make a family with, but in vain. And in all his free-will wanderings everywhere his fate casts him, he builds fountains not for money, but to bring people happiness. Once he happens to visit a steppe collective farm, where he is trying to build a fountain and where he meets the sole and unique. But a girl already has a boy-friend, and he has to do his best to conquer her love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b1C50kVhQhaGvhrW3G14oPWT1R0.jpg", "actors": ["Vladimir Smirnov ()", "Valentina Telichkina ()", "Aleksandr Movchan ()", "Yelena Kozlitina ()", "Adolf Ilin ()", "Rais Galyamov ()", "Genrikh Bill ()", "Yuriy Sorokin ()", "Pyotr Lyubeshkin ()", "Tatyana Klyuyeva ()", "Serafim Zaytsev ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
