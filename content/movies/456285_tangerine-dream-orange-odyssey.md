You'll see TD full of passion, strength and lady power. The very interesting merging of music, generic lights and full laser program has made this performance to a quite outstanding experience for those who could attend the concert. Especially for TD's diehard brigade it's a meal deluxe and hardly comparable to other moving pics from orange dreamland. Did you ever hear about the effectiveness of acoustic amphetamines -- here you have it!\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rGohkQqooA4rSv1fGomwxfFNXoR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
