Dramatic Exchange describes it as \"Widely considered to be the most important Hungarian play of the last 20 years\".  The odd title of the play refers in the first instance to the chicken heads that an old woman feeds to her cat. However, it can also be taken to refer more broadly to the obtuse behaviour of the main characters in the play. The play is an odd mixture of pathos and nihilism, written against the bleak background of Stalinist totalitarianism from which Hungary was emerging. As with much modern drama, there is no hero in the play. The only noble behaviour that one can find belongs to one of the characters in the past, when he was a child, but he is no longer as he was. The hint that what once existed might be achieved again is the only faint ray of hope in a very bleak view of the human condition.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sjmRd75GKHtVNmBCyjgByaChwGR.jpg", "actors": ["Hilda Gobbi (V\u00e9nasszony)", "Zolt\u00e1n Papp (Tan\u00e1r)", "Erika Bodn\u00e1r (N\u0151)", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Vajda (Apa)", "Zolt\u00e1n Varga (Sr\u00e1c)", "Vilmos Vajdai (Haver)", "D\u00e9nes Ujlaky (T\u00f6rzs)", "K\u00e1roly Eperjes (K\u00f6zeg)", "M\u00e1ria Ronyecz (El\u0151ad\u00f3n\u0151)", "\u00c1gnes Zs\u00edros (Csitri)", "Mari Csom\u00f3s (Anya)", "Krisztina, Szalai (Bakfis)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
