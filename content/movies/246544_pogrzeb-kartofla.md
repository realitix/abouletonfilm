Mateusz is an old-timer, a saddler, who finds nothing but hostility when he makes it home after years away. He is not a Jew, though the villagers brand him one and give him a hard time. They feel guilty about the death of his son at the end of the war, and don't want the father around. In the background: beginnings of the Communist regime in Poland.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wdgcsHAcZgQ5mqoMLgo9UbUkw63.jpg", "actors": ["Franciszek Pieczka ()", "Adam Ferency ()", "Mariusz Saniternik ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
