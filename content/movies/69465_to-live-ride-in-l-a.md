From the neon glow of Hollywood to the sun-drenched boardwalk of Venice Beach, fixed-gear has evolved into a vibrant street culture that is uniquely L.A. From director David Rowe (Fast Friday) comes a new documentary feature that explores a side of L.A. few outsiders have seen. From races through rush-hour traffic to midnight loft parties, To Live &amp; Ride in L.A. is a fast paced-trip through the busy streets and back-alleys of one of the world's largest cities. To Live &amp; Ride in L.A. features talented local riders tearing up the streets with first-time visitor Keo Curry (Fast Friday, Macaframa) - one of the living legends of the sport. Bike to hidden spots off the map, race a midnight alley-cat, keep pace with the riders from Wolfpack, and hang with the local crews, graffiti artists and other L.A. personalities burning up the fixed-gear scene.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2YgKjSWSxSoutJmjY7LU6MTqDGF.jpg", "actors": ["Keo Curry (Keo)", "George Gregor (George)", "Hernan Montenegro (Lil' Hern)", "Mr. Quick (Mr. Quick)", "Kyle Kelley (Trackosaurus Rex (as Tracko))", "Ace Carretero (Ace Boogie)", "Efrem Yohannes (Efrem)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
