Derek Jacobi delivers an electrifying award-winning portrayal of Rostand's legendary log-nosed swordsman in this highly acclaimed production from the world's premier theatre troupe, The Royal Shakespeare Company. The bold Cyrano boasts he can defeat a hundred men in a swordfight, but because of his grotesque nose lacks the confidence to court the woman he loves. Yet so entranced with Roxanne is Cyrano that he uses the eloquence of his poetry to woo her for a rival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5bh69qf61Bxs7SloxQxCwJShncK.jpg", "actors": ["Derek Jacobi (Cyrano de Bergerac)", "John Carlisle (Le Comte de Guiche)", "John Bowe (Le Bret)", "Pete Postlethwaite (Ragueneau)", "Tom Mannion (Christian de Neuvillette)", "Sin\u00e9ad Cusack (Roxanne)", "Jimmy Gardner (Doorkeeper / Capuchin)", "Richard Clifford (Cavalryman / Gascony Cadet)", "Robert Clare (D'Artagnan / Gascony Cadet)", "Philip Dennis (Flunkey / Gascony Cadet)", "John Tramper (Flunkey / Gascony Cadet)", "Geoffrey Freshwater (Musketeer)", "Alexandra Brook (Flowergirl / Sister Claire)", "Phillip Walsh (Drinker / Gascony Cadet)", "Simon Clark (Citizen / Gascony Cadet)", "Jayne Tottman (Citizen's Son)", "Paul Basson (Page)", "Stephen Kennedy (Page)", "Raymond Llewellyn (Pickpocket)", "Jeffery Dench (Marquis 1)", "David Glover (Marquis 2)", "Dennis Clinton (Cuigy)", "Edward Jewesbury (Brisaille)", "George Parsons (Ligni\u00e8re the Poet)", "Penelope Beaumont (Precieuse / Mother Marguerite / Lise)", "Clare Byam-Shaw (Precieuse)", "Cathy Finlay (Food Seller / Sister Marthe)", "Jennie Goossens (Roxane's Duenna)", "Christopher Bowen (Le Vicomte de Valvert / Gascony Cadet)", "Christopher Benjamin (Montfleury)", "David Shaw-Parker (Bellerose / Gascony Cadet)", "Raymond Bowers (Jodelet)", "Ken Bones (Carbon de Castel Jaloux)", "Niall Padden (Eater / Gascony Cadet)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
