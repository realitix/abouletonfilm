The music starts accompanied only by black leader: then there is a sudden flare of pure white which begins to flicker with negative-colored ephemeral shapes, until finally the music and a fulsome mass of scratched images are accompanying each other. At times a distinctly different quality of colored image appears and continues for awhile (non-orange negative photography of painted film as well as picture images).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1rr9izT7Q92FFl5iFPBSH8Q3S3w.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [383841, 285768, 262854, 152973], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
