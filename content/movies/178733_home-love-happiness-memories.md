The two talk about their experiences, relationships and plans for the future, but have to part as morning comes.  The second segment tells the story of widow Buajan (Penpak Sirikul), who continues to find notes left by her late husband (Witoon Jaiprom), which keep her bonded to his memory but also prevents her from moving on.  The last segment centres on the wedding of Chiang Mai native Preeya (Siraphan Wattanajinda) and Leng (Ruangsak Loychusak), a businessman from Phuket. Problems arise on the wedding day after Preeya has an encounter with her ex-boyfriend Pek (Supoj Chancharoen), although she is supported by her aunt (Puttachat Pongsuchat) and brother (Witwisit Hiranyawongkul).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aQWVa5tAFOAVNbo7KJfMfqm8XzY.jpg", "actors": ["Chutavuth Pattarakampol (Nay)", "Kittisak Patomburana (Beam)", "Witoon Jaiprom (Late Husband)", "Siraphan Wattanajinda (Preeya)", "Ruangsak Loychusak (Leng)", "Supoj Chancharoen (Pek)", "Puttachat Pongsuchat (Pek's Aunt)", "Witwisit Hiranyawongkul (Pek's Brother)", "Penpak Sirikul (Buajan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
