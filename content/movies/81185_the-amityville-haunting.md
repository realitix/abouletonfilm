This terrible catastrophe of a movie is just another one of these damn low budget, soulless Found Footage atrocities, that should have wandered off right into the trash bin before someone had to see this. Thanks but no thanks, never ever again! One extra point for some titties, but that's the only good thing in this entire crap flick..."}], "recommandations_id": [406582, 42942, 147879, 356482], "youtube_key": "J9bcgmZ-ZPM"}
