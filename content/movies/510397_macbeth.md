Starring Mark Rowley, (The Last Kingdom, Luther). Monkman\u2019s unique adaptation successfully bridges the gap between theatre and film to create a wholly new type of imaginative space. This radical new adaptation puts the audience\u2019s engagement with the story centre-stage, amplifying the theatrical context of the original and creating truly innovative and thrilling cinematic vistas, whilst maintaining the language and themes of Shakespeare\u2019s original play. Using background matte painting and computer modelling to generate the world in which the action plays out, the green screen allows Monkman to create his vision of a multi-tiered globe in which the characters play out their various fates.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pHWfFhwG2sTKFQBSx9z8lwDMsPV.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Rowley (Macbeth)", "Al Weaver (Banquo)", "Akiya Henry (Lady Macbeth)", "Charles Mnene (Macduff)", "David Bark-Jones (Duncan)", "David Bradley (Porter)", "Wunmi Mosaku (Mother)", "Kelly Burke (Lady Macduff)", "Phillipe Spall (Seyton)", "Valentine Pelka (Siward)", "Wil Johnson (Captain)", "Charlie Hamblett (Malcolm)", "Kian Hurst-Conroy (Fleance)", "Emily Carding (Lady Ross)", "Alan McKenna (Ross)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "s4oWXb1m3fU"}
