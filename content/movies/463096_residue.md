Residue began as a trip from Beirut to Izmir on Turkey\u2019s Aegean coast. From there, Samaha headed northward to Ayvalik, an old seaport village in the country\u2019s northwest region, where he caught a ferryboat that took him to Greece\u2019s ancient city of Mytilene. The artist retraces the journey of successive waves of migration, following the route of people moving from the Aegean, Anatolian and southern European regions to the Eastern Mediterranean and Egypt. Based on Samaha\u2019s journey, Residue is a moving image diary comprised of over 85 GIFs that explore the recurring movement of waters, peoples and cultures.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
