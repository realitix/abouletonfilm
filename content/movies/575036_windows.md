The first section begins at an El train stop, capturing the station itself and the views of people playing tennis as seen from the moving train. A switch approximately halfway through the runtime moves the action to downtown Chicago\u2019s Buckingham Fountain and then Logan Square as filmed through Elam\u2019s window screen. The shapes of the buildings finally abstract into geometric forms on film.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
