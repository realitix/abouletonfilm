Jones\u2019s highly acclaimed dance, Still/Here. At workshops around the country, people facing life-threatening illnesses are asked to remember the highs and lows of their lives, and even imagine their own deaths. They then transform their feelings into expressive movement, which Jones incorporates into the dance performed later in the program. Jones demonstrates for Moyers the movements of his own life story \u2014 his first encounter with white people, confusion over his sexuality, his partner Arnie Zane\u2019s untimely death from AIDS, and Jones\u2019s own HIV status.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kPjSEDMwBCej5Ni65nT5fXzibPY.jpg", "actors": ["Bill T.
