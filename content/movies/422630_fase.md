Reich allows his tones to gradually shift in rhythm and melody and between the instruments. The choreography applies the same phase-shifting principle. The purely abstract movements are executed so perfectly that they seem almost mechanical and yet affect us in a strange way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uxk2JXWuAoCJ4S8xMG0q876k0sA.jpg", "actors": ["Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker (Herself (Dancer))", "Mich\u00e8le-Anne De Mey (Herself (Dancer))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
