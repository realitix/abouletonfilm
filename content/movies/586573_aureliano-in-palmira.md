Soon afterwards the work was played in different theatres all over Europe. Nevertheless Rossini's piece fell into oblivion more and more compared to the great competitors like \"Tancredi\" or the \"Barber of Seville\" for which Rossini recycled musical parts of \"Aureliano\".  But since a few years there are ambitions to play this work about love, war, jealousy, loyalty and magnanimity more frequently. The direction in Pesaro was in the proven hands of the famous lm director Mario Martone. Conductor Will Crutcheld contributes to the successful performance of the newly edited \"Aureliano in Palmira\" and masterfully directs the Orchestra Sinfonica G. Rossini.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qshgVElYuHAqYcCXmvs6WF1ghyd.jpg", "actors": ["Jessica Pratt ()", "Michael Spyres ()", "Lena Belkina ()", "Raffaella Lupinacci ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
