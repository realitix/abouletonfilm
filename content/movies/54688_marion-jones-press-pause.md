After starring at the University of North Carolina and winning gold at the 1997 and '99 World Track and Field Championships, her rise to the top culminated at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. There, she captivated the world with her beauty, style and athletic dominance, sprinting and jumping to three gold medals and two bronze. Eventually, though, her accomplishments and her reputation would be tarnished. For years, Jones denied the increasing speculation that she used performance-enhancing drugs. But in October 2007, she finally admitted what so many had long suspected -- that she had indeed used steroids. Jones was sentenced to six months in prison for lying to federal investigators and soon saw her Olympic achievements disqualified. Now a free woman, Jones is running in a new direction in life and taking time to reflect.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ui9lAwAmc5IxYnxvqm8iwYVMO0F.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [54680, 54740, 54685, 54672], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
