Given the very tough topic of social deprivation, extreme poverty and shockingly appalling living conditions, I expected \"Cageman\" to be very tough to watch. This turns out not to be the case. Instead, \"Cageman\" is a warm, positive and loving film about friendship. People in the caged housing live as harmonious as possible, supporting each other by their limited means.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kQZaaMJOdrXe4MGd9L5BqUURu5j.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Lee Ming-Yeung (7-11)", "Roy Chiao (Fatso)", "Ku Feng (Luk Tung)", "Dick Liu (Prince Sam)", "Wu Fung (Officer Lam)", "Teddy Robin (Tong San)", "Victor Wong (Sissy)", "Wong Ka-Kui (Mao)", "Lau Shun (Taoist)", "Tats Lau (Brother Sang)", "Dennis Chan (Councillor Tsui)", "Joe Junior (Charlie)", "Chow Chung (Councillor Chow)", "Teddy Chan (The man executing the possession order)", "Sze Kai-Keung (TV interviewer)", "Tang Cheung (Dai Lap Hing)", "Quinton Wong Liu-Che (Junkie A)", "Cho Sai (Old man behind the bed)", "Herman Yau (TV crew member)", "Andrew Kam (Fireman)", "Man Chai (Postman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
