He's musical, playing the top of the castle like a piano, but that doesn't make him nice or her happy. She sends a letter to her father the king, with the help of a musical bird. The king calls for a volunteer, and the smallest knight steps forth. He traps the giant's guard dragon under the castle gate, then ties the dragon's tail around the giant's ankle and has the dragon haul him into the sea. Just in time, because he was preparing to saute the princess. The knight saves her and returns in triumph.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
