Clever editing is used for the scene where her two characters meet. La Badie, however, does appear twice within a scene via superimposition, but that's in a flashback-within-a-mirror scene. There are a couple such scenes where La Badie's reflection in the mirror reflects her reflective melancholy mood.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hGB3ZTZgXrzSQx1fPahLdQtgNLw.jpg", "actors": ["Florence La Badie ()", "Richard Neill ()", "Gertrude Dallas ()", "Arthur Bauer ()", "Wayne Arey ()", "J.H.
