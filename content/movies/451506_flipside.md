The film unveils the story of the legendary medium for records, very popular in the USSR, undeservedly forgotten in the years of the perestroika and raised from the ashes nowadays. What is the place of the wax record in the world of digital technologies? Who are the people that collect, sell and buy wax records today, and why do they do this? Who are those that try their best to impede them? Why do disk jockeys and musicians continue to idolize wax records? How did the wax record players make it back from garbage cans to the luxury HI-END shops? You will find answers to all these questions in a unique film for music fans, a trip through the world of music in the 20th century, at high speed, to the most sincere and humane format of the music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eZ6XNwUeFNioSKuXwStYKHZXWb8.jpg", "actors": ["Roman Litvinov (himself)", "Ivan Alekseev (himself)", "The Beat Junkies (himself)", "Dmitry Spirin (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
