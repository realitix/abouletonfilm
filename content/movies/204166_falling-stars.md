Once there, he muses about his childhood and a little girl he had loved - someone who could easily have grown up to be the nurse that is attending to him now. As he recuperates, he and the nurse fall in love and he very much wants to marry her. At this point, the nurse's mother comes for a visit and advises him against such an action because if they were to marry and he were subsequently killed or maimed in action - the fighting is still close to the hospital - the nurse would suffer much more than if he just left her alone. Now it is up to the soldier to make a decision one way or the other.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/31RjZN00iqNCPvuk700YH7gha3P.jpg", "actors": ["Dariya Mikhaylova (Lida)", "Pyotr Fyodorov (Misha Yerofeyev)", "Alla Demidova (Lida's Mother)", "Vera Glagoleva (Zhenka)", "Pyotr Yurchenkov St. (Sashka)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
