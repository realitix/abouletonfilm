Hydrofoiling has revolutionized the sport, now boats are designed to instantly propel themselves from the surface of the water and into the air, relegating the drag barrier to next to nothing, defying logic and the imagination. The engineering behind foiling has literally transformed sailing to one of the fastest, most dangerous competitions on earth by pushing to the extreme limits of design. And it is because of these revolutionary designs, that teams employ recon masters determined to spy and steal coveted engineering secrets from their competitors. The film travels to Bermuda, where we meet Artemis Racing, challenger to the 35th America's Cup.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zmJpVN4bQIDKKIHxzuH6EtpcM20.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
