Then one day he gets married, but the wife is frustrated by his aimless lifestyle &amp; irresponsible attitude (even after she gets pregnant). So she goes back to her parents. Meanwhile, his sister who is now living with her lover, can no longer provide for him, and a kind widow who used to care for him passes away. He has nowhere &amp; nobody to fall back on, and from this point on, as he starts a job as assistant to a lorry driver, he starts looking at life in a whole new way and begins to mature as well.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iQ4o6WuoUX2GkEDGYwrlQYqVtii.jpg", "actors": ["Gopi (Sankaran Kutty)", "KPAC Lalitha (Shanthamma)", "Thikkurissy Sukumaran Nair ()", "Aranmula Ponnamma ()", "Vilasini (Sankarankutty's sister)", "Kaviyoor Ponnamma (Kamalamma)", "Adoor Bhavani (Santhamma's mother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "bWLlYQpSOdQ"}
