Silently the words \u201cred,\u201d \u201cblue,\u201d \u201cgreen\u201d are slowly and repeatedly articulated. The color of the screen switches from red to blue to green at a quickened rate. Utilizing the same rate, the spoken words, \u201cred,\u201d \u201cblue,\u201d and \u201cgreen,\u201d are cut together into syllabic combinations of the three words making up the asynchronous sound track. The individual words, barely intelligible as spoken, are more easily \u201cread\u201d on the uniformly moving lips. (Quasha, George and Charles Stein.
