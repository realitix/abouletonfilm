Restoration was a complex process involving algorithmic computer programming deployed to synchronise sound with images originally recorded (on monochrome Super 8mm film!) at the unusually slow rate of 18 frames per second. The result is cinema as a miraculous time-travel machine, a city-poem which transports us to hidden corners that only a true Coney-Islander would know: a native like writer, director, producer and editor Paula Gladstone. She also arranged the soundtrack, featuring music that ranges from Duke Ellington to the Drifters (\"under the board-walk, down by sea...\") and, most stirringly, LaBelle.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
