A young rabbit, lost in the snow, comes in, and the wolf eyes him hungrily. The rabbit is amazingly polite, and just before the wolf is about to cook him, asks the wolf to be his daddy. The wolf can't bring himself to eat him, and sends him away. But the hunger will not stop, so he sets out in search of the rabbit.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
