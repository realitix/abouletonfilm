Decades later, the echoes of John McNaughton\u2019s film sound in El Tila: Fragmentos de un psic\u00f3pata, a story about a homicide with a troubled past. Security cameras record his last days: he lives in discomfort with himself and others, almost like a death rattle. His past filters through his writings and a journalist will try to reveal them. Repellent and brutal, El Tila avoids overstressing and loud elements while building a dry yet very uncomfortable story. Going against classic storytelling, the view that guides the story here is not the victim\u2019s, but the killer\u2019s. In a nutshell: psycho killers in real life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/85j4jFqWCbYK7LVbA4ejgrX7PQF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
