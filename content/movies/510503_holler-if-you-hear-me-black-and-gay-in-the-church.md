The stories in the documentary are varied, passionate and inspiring. Clay Cane, who created and produced the film, traveled to Atlanta, where church and LGBT culture cross paths like nowhere else, to dive into one of the most taboo topics in the Black community. With extraordinary access and without judgment, Cane and BET.com tackle this controversial but important issue through the journeys of those who are living it everyday and whose stories prove we all deserve to be heard and loved.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gSFqIOmHG9DrbG2i3DvEeVciGeV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
