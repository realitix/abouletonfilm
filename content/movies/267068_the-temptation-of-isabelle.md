Since Isabelle had been in love with Alain (Xavier Deluc) in the past, Bruno invites Alain to a surprise birthday party for her at a hotel -- what better way to judge her feelings than to get them together? Alain arrives with his current girlfriend Lio (Fanny Bastien) to find that the \"party\" is only a foursome. Soon after the two couples start the evening off, their polite exteriors deteriorate as they bicker on, and on, and on.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jIXlltbbGhBhGMAZKaOfDwGCtUo.jpg", "actors": ["Ann-Gisel Glass ()", "Jacques Bonnaff\u00e9 ()", "Fanny Bastien ()", "Xavier Deluc ()", "Fran\u00e7oise Brion ()", "Henri Virlojeux ()", "Anne-Marie Maill\u00e9 ()", "Charlotte Gainsbourg ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
