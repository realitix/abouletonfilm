Not long after her arrival, Bobo witnesses a gang fight dominated by a man she was friends with as a child. Now known as Jaguar, he works as a bodyguard for mob boss Kam, who is having a row with one of his partners. Jaguar makes trouble at one of the man's casinos as a part of a plan to smooth over the situation. Ace gunman Ko Tang is also in town and the two strike up an alliance to take over Kam's empire. Jaguar's lust for power soon alienates Bobo, who realizes that she was simply a pawn in his plan to gain control of the Shanghai underworld. Held a virtual prisoner, Bobo's one hope for revenge is Luo Lie, another friend from childhood and now her fiancee, currently imprisoned in Germany.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xo1xlmX28Bx8805TaHlXPQzM03s.jpg", "actors": ["Hua Chung (Jaguar)", "Tony Liu (He Lie)", "Nora Miao (Bobo Kam)", "Ling Yun (Ko Tang)", "Wai Wang (Mr. Kam)", "Fan Mei-Sheng (Cheung Sam)", "Chan Shen (Tin Pa)", "Hao Li-Jen (Fan Lo)", "Shaw Yin Yin (Sum Chun-tsui)", "Johnny Wang Lung-Wei (Wu Bui)", "Lam Fai-Wong (Shek Lung)", "Keung Hon (Cheung-chin)", "Lee Hang (Nokawa)", "Jamie Luk Kim-Ming (Araki)", "Gam Lau (Mrs Mui)", "Mak Wa-Mei (Mrs Mui's daughter)", "Alan Chan Kwok-Kuen (Da-tzang/Daizo)", "Wong Ching-Ho (Blind Chan)", "Sai Gwa-Pau (Mr Kam's servant)", "Yuen Biao (Mr Kam's thug/Lau Wing's double)", "Corey Yuen (Sam's thug)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
