She meets the newcomer Pierre, who disturbs the peace of the small village and teaches the locals how to enjoy life. The film is full of fireworks of lovely colours, and a warm feeling. It is like a carousel of humour and human situations that carry us away, from the very first frame to the unexpected ending, making the viewer laugh gaily. Using a mosaic approach to the traditional narrative line, the film director creates a picture of fairly anarchic glee. \u201cCelebration in the Botanical Garden\u201d is a world of fantasy, full of summer fun, good humour and delight. E. Havetta\u00b4s debut was inspired by na\u00efve art, French impressionism, and silent slap-stick as well as Western Slovakian folk traditions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/r3hwL9gh2FzDYHPoW1uIvyfEvPm.jpg", "actors": ["Slavoj Urban (Pierre)", "Jir\u00ed S\u00fdkora (Gaspar)", "Nina Div\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (Katar\u00edna)", "Hana Slivkov\u00e1 (M\u00e1ria)", "Zuzana Cig\u00e1nov\u00e1 (Margita)", "Marta Raslov\u00e1 (Mi)", "Du\u0161an Bla\u0161kovi\u010d (Kov\u00e1c)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
