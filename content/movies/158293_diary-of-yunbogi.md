The voiceover comprises diary entries from a six-year-old Korean boy, and Oshima\u2019s own reflections on Japanese-Korean relations, a controversial subject that he revisited in his later films Sing a Song of Sex and Death by Hanging.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/NOsN5Ir1v7Ekx4j3MdXtApMUpB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
