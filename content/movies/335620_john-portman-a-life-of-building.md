Over 45 years, Portman's iconic urban statements and eye-popping interiors have risen in 60 cities on four continents to redefine cityscapes in America, and skylines in China and the rest of Asia. The film captures Portman's approach in an intimate portrait that, by turn, assesses and appreciates Portman's work. Dramatic time-lapse footage shows off Portman's buildings at their best- often in moving sunlight that washes over his facades and spaces.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lz1iZijqYxl5oebKc2P7Irqaf6E.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
