When Mark dies of AIDS, Simon gets on with his life rather quickly, too quickly to suit the ghost of Mark, who reappears to disrupt Simon's cruising and then moves back into their flat to prompt Simon to experience and express feelings. Simon is adamant that feelings, especially love, are not for him. Subplots develop as Mark and Simon observe their neighbor Siobhan's love life and as Simon spends his days as a satellite-TV installer partnered with Dogger, a homophobe ignorant that Simon is gay. Is there any key that can unlock Simon's feelings and allow Mark to rest in peace?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rmSjncEkpYyRh9tGyGaf8mzg5Z3.jpg", "actors": ["Ian Williams (Mark)", "Thomas Arklie (Simon)", "Gordon Alexander (Drop Dead Gorgeous (as Gordon Milne))", "Dillie Keane (Siobban)", "Nicholas Harrison (Siobhan's First Lover)", "Ian McKellen (Quilt Documentary Narrator (voice))", "Sinitta Renet Malone (Quilt Documentary Narrator (voice) (as Sinitta))", "Caroline Munro (Mrs. Pignon)", "Paul Cottingham (1st Poxy Shirt Lifter)", "Lloyd T.
