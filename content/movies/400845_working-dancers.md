This is the story of four talented dancers, Ernesto, Bettina, Victoria and Pablo, along six years of their journey. We follow their lives, we attend their rehearsals and performances in the emblematic building of the National Library, along with their premiere and backstage in the historical National Theatre of Cervantes. They expose their dreams as dancers, individuals and members of our society, as we observe the fulfilment of their biggest dream: the demand of a National Dance Law. Amazing choreographies, beautiful folklore songs and original Latin-American contemporary music reveal the beauty of dance becoming life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uotbk7CQ2CyimKujEYvxH7Srb34.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
