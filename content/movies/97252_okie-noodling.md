Today, the tradition of \"noodling\" still has Okie anglers hooked. This documentary by Bradley Beesley features interviews with hardcore handfishing veterans as well as footage of real noodlers in action. Set against an original musical score by rock band The Flaming Lips, Okie Noodling offers an anecdotal look at a most unusual piece of Midwest American culture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ylvDSDRFPRiz44BuQBraFuBsVeX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
