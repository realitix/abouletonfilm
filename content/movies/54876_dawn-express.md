Two U.S. chemical companies are developing the formula, with each working on half for security purposes. The spies get half the formula and know that either of two chemists, Robert Norton or Tom Fielding, knows the rest. They capture Fielding, through a ruse by gang member Linda Pavlo, and threaten the life of his sister Nancy and his mother if he does not give them the formula. To protect his friend Fielding, who does know the formula and is engaged to Nancy, Tom pretends to know the secret and boards the Dawn Express plane with the spy leader and his gang.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p0lqazPG7vizz2ipttthpj94aPW.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Whalen (Robert Norton)", "Anne Nagel (Nancy Fielding)", "William Bakewell (Tom Fielding)", "Constance Worth (Linda Pavlo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
