It is also perhaps the first effort to privilege the voices of the Iraqi people, from all walks of life as well as social, economic and ethnic backgrounds. While many have talked about and for the Iraqi people, few media outlets have sought to probe beyond the simplistic binary of pro-US/pro-Saddam perspective so often found in Western and Arab media portrayals of Iraq. About Baghdad presents Iraqis who describe the pain, complexity and suffering of living under decades of tyranny, oppression, wars, sanctions and now occupation.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jIWIr3twgnX65VNMKguDFdVdxB5.jpg", "actors": ["Sinan Antoon ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
