She loses it on the way and a bulldog prevents her from reacquiring it, but she outwits him and proceeds to the show. There she breaks the stalk when she uses her bean-shooter at a hummingbird. She tosses the flower in a barrel of Vigaro and the flower suddenly bursts into bloom again.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jackson Beck (Lulu's Father (voice))", "Cecil Roy (Little Lulu (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
