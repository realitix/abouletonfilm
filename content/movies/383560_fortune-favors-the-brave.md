When her mother, who\u2019s raising her kids on her own, has to return unexpectedly to Vietnam, Linh looks after her little sister Tien and the family restaurant on her own. Of course, no one is supposed to find out, not the school, not the neighbours, and definitely not child protective services. But Linh\u2019s biggest problem has red hair, a telescope and a sly grin: Pauline. The daredevil from across the street has the whole neighbourhood under surveillance and can\u2019t imagine anything cooler than a life without parents. When Pauline blackmails the Vietnamese sisters into starting a gang with her, the three girls set off on a daring adventure.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d07Bv2I7r0Ek1IPk0A3oQ0y1qBx.jpg", "actors": ["Andreas Schmidt (Frank Weiss)", "Lena Stolze (Frau Trost)", "Janina Elkin (Frau Schneider)", "Ulrike Bliefert (Frau Rose)", "Ulrich Brandhoff (Polizist)", "Linda Anh Dang (Tien)", "Lynn Dortschack (Linh)", "Petra Kleinert ()", "Steffi K\u00fchnert ()", "\u0110inh Y Nhung (Thao)", "Anna Schumacher (Frau Lorenz)", "Manh Cuong Tran (Mr. Duong)", "Florian Wihstutz ()", "Lisa Wihstutz (Pauline)", "Nguyen Thi Cieu Xuan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
