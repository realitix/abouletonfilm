At the luncheon is Khrushchov, a passionate environmentalist, called \"the Wood Demon\" by all, in love with Sonya and she with him, but neither will say it. Two weeks later there's a family meeting at the professor's estate; two weeks after that, a supper at the cabin of Dyadin, who's cheerful to all. George, Helen, Sonya, and Khrushchov are each suffocating. Can any of them take action?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d4LBGUsgt9oiNlo21xm4diTMm5W.jpg", "actors": ["Ian Holm ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
