Big-dicked French schoolboy Pierre Buisson regales a photographer during a photo-shoot with sizzling tales of his rape by two straight co-workers at a bakery, and his steamy afternoon tryst on the stairs of an apartment building - all the while playing with his massive endowment in and out of a well-worn jockstrap. This is all-male eroticism at its best, shot entirely on film and in French. Lots and lots of oozy pre-cum loaded young cocks help fortify All of Me (aka Aime Comme Minet) into a pre-condom masterpiece.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m2oEqLrCKhc7d7LAcFgxgOXexfd.jpg", "actors": ["Pierre Buisson ()", "Lo\u00efc le Gallec ()", "Luigi di Como ()", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lemaire ()", "Ducko Vuckovic ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
