Fanci's not sure her parents will come, and that upsets her; this focus on her parents, in turn, upsets Loretta. Sam, Fanci's ex-boyfriend and now the boyfriend of Fanci's house-mate, Sophia, has accidentally torn Fanci's wedding dress. Plus, all over San Francisco are mysterious power outages. That night, strange adventures befall the principals: Fanci has a terrifying vision that sends her running naked into the streets; her father visits a cross-dressing dominant; her mother follows him into the night and has her own misadventures; Sam, looking for a tailor, calls on Loretta.
