{"tmdb_id": 450458, "title": "Salome", "original_title": "Salome", "slug_title": "salome", "date": "1974-04-10", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "This filmed version of Strauss' shocker features Teresa Stratas as opera's most depraved teenager, and she's as perfect a Salome as one would ever hope to see or hear. Stratas inhabits the role, exploring the character's sensuousness as she vainly woos Jochanaan, her venomous hatred when she's rejected, the crazed look in her eyes when she demands his head--on a silver platter, no less. Such complete identification with a role, especially of a character so malignant helps make this 1974 Salome stand out among the many fine DVDs of the opera.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gq0dXBsSsH0eB9oWxK7SOaxbHAp.jpg", "actors": ["Teresa Stratas (Salome)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
