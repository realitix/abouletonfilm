Moisture, natural light and leafy green make the fabrics glow, and the discarded and broken tend to be quiet abstractions, but at the same time they are disturbing because of the aura of domestic life\" (Christine Noll Brinckmann)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/izBtgXhNBhJsw9D7ixN3xcYRlW2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
