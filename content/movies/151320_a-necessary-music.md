A musically conceived piece, referencing the video operas of Robert Ashley, the film explores the social imaginary of a utopian landscape through directed attention to the voices that inhabit it.Treating the medium of film as both a musical proposition and a proposal for collective production, A Necessary Music employs the resident of New York\u2019s Roosevelt Island as its authors and actors, gathering together texts written by them and using them to construct a script for the film. Framed by a fictional narration taken from Adolfo Bioy Casares\u2019 1941 science fiction novel \u2018The invention of Morel\u2019, the film self-consciously dissolves from attempted realism to imagined narrative; what begins as a enthnographic study becomes instead an imagined fiction and an investigation into the mechanics of representation itself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gGwi1DmmDVi05HL1gQt7mj54Yx5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
