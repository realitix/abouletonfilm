His greatest journeys were through the world's largest sand desert: the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Peninsula. Inspired by their hero, adventurers Alastair Humphreys and Leon McCarron attempt a journey of their own into the Empty Quarter. Their trip is hastily-planned and low budget: unable to afford camels they instead hope to drag a homemade steel cart (filled with 300kg of supplies) through the ferocious desert heat. This film is their story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/osbrNmx012iEQJ4u5JViUNdNmFa.jpg", "actors": ["Alastair Humphreys (Himself)", "Leon McCarron (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
