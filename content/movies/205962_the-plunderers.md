The \"killing,\" however, is merely a ruse set up to allow army agent Johnny Drum (Cameron) to infiltrate a gang of highway robbers. The gang is led by Whit Lacey (Forrest Tucker), and although Johnny is determined to bring Whit and his men to justice, he cannot help befriending the charming rascal. It all comes to a head when the Sioux attack the local fort and both Johnny and Whit prove that they at least have something in common -- bravery and loyalty. Ilona Massey, as Cameron's love interest, performs \"Walking Down Broadway,\" by William H. Lingard and Charles E. Pratt, and \"I'll Sing a Love Song,\" with lyrics by Jack Elliott and Aaron Gonzales.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4eh7MddUMmH7QSIH1HTQburLh8l.jpg", "actors": ["Rod Cameron (John Drum)", "Ilona Massey (Lin Connor)", "Lorna Gray (Julie Ann McCabe (as Adrian Booth))", "Forrest Tucker (Whit Lacey)", "George Cleveland (Sheriff Sam Borden)", "Grant Withers (Deputy Tap Lawrence)", "Taylor Holmes (Eben Martin)", "Paul Fix (Calico)", "Francis Ford (Barnaby)", "James Flavin (Sergeant Major)", "Russell Hicks (Cavalry Colonel)", "Maude Eburne (Old Dame at Wedding)", "Mary Ruth Wade (Pioneer Girl)", "Louis Faust (Fort Sentry (as Louis R.
