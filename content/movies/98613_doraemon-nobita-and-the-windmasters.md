Nobita names it Fuuko. Eventually, he, Doraemon and their friends take it to a vast countryside through the Anywhere Door. There, they learn about the Wind and Storm Villages, and Fuuko\u2019s real identity. Soon, Nobita and his friends have to protect Fuuko from the Storm Village and a now-possessed Nobuo, who is being controlled by the spirit of the Storm Village\u2019s former leader.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tw7dMhADid8TTKnUS2ZKFQtAAFh.jpg", "actors": ["Michiko Nomura (Shizuka Minamoto (voice))", " Nobuyo Oyama (Doraemon (voice))", "Noriko Ohara  (Nobita Nobi (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [192904], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
