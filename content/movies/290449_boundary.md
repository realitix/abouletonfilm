A guilt-ridden and disheveled taxi driver named LIMUEL ALCANTARA picks up a mild-mannered businessman named EMMANUEL LAZARO as his last passenger for the night. Limuel's conspiracy to bring Emmanuel to the hideout of robbery gang leader DIEGO GAWARAN takes a wrong turn. Their journey together from Manila to the foothills of Antipolo becomes a tension-filled and claustrophobic experience. The only way out of this seemingly eternal ride is to face their damnation.  - Written by the Producers", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7ANjXMwBXgdrYdxSDfatuBn5znK.jpg", "actors": ["Ronnie Lazaro ()", "Raymond Bagatsing ()", "Edwin Pamanian ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
