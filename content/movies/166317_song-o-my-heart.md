Sean is a great tenor, in semi-retirement, living in a village close to Mary, the woman he\u2019s always loved. Mary\u2019s aunt convinced her to marry a man for his money; he has recently deserted her, leaving her penniless. She and her two children, Eileen and Tad, move in with the selfish and austere aunt. Eileen is falling in love with Fergus, a young man who\u2019s off to Dublin to seek his fortune. Sean is drawn out of retirement and goes on tour in America. At his first concert, he\u2019s nervous and out of sorts until the last song, when peace descends on him like a gift. What has happened, and can family life be set right?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ePpWlrZog0ViyqBsBz259Sm0UOR.jpg", "actors": ["John McCormack (Sean)", "Alice Joyce (Mary)", "Maureen O'Sullivan (Eileen)", "John Garrick (Fergus)", "J.
