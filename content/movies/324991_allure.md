Each one struggles to overcome her personal conflict, set against the Occupy Wall Street movements of 2011. These stories touch and inform each other, and create a larger narrative about gender, emigration, power, class, and personal politics.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rvmaQ61PIC6Mtn9LBeMNH80oQgo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
