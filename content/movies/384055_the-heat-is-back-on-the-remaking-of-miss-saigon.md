Last seen in the West End 15 years ago, Miss Saigon has become one of the most successful musicals in history and the greatest success ever to play the Theatre Royal Drury Lane.  Miss Saigon has been seen by over 40 million people worldwide. From the process of casting 40 actors from 18 different countries, to the reinvention of the staging, including the famous helicopter scene, The Heat is Back On takes us on a journey through rehearsals right up to the star-studded opening night.  Featuring interviews with legendary producer Cameron Mackintosh, authors Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Sch\u00f6nberg and many of the award-winning cast and creative team, this documentary is one of the most revealing documentaries ever about how a major musical production comes to life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sbeNz2U0tMZC2DL8h1YcIRjLCLH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
