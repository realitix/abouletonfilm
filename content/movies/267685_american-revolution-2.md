Investigating the lack of an African American presence at the protests, the filmmakers follow members of the Chicago chapter of the Black Panther Party as they search for common ground with a variety of white activist groups.  In one scene, Panther Bobby Lee and members of the Young Patriots, a community of white Appalachian activists living in the Uptown neighborhood of Chicago, organize to protest police brutality. The seemingly disparate groups find shared social and political objectives that overcome racial differences \u2013 police violence, poverty, lack of employment, and poor living conditions. This potential for a cross-racial and interethnic political movement is the movie\u2019s beautiful but unrealized dream.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y03qyZJhg3XaTBuK6TDoQEswupJ.jpg", "actors": ["Richard J.
