The conversation went on for two weeks. The results were aired on German TV in 1992 and debuted on U.S. television when it was shown on Turner Classic Movies in 2006. We are presented with a generous smattering of film clips, rare photographs and artwork, but mostly Wilder just sits in his office and talks with the off screen Schlondorff, moving easily between English and German.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jf4VRWK7crlJJjiNFO6GIWbBVJ3.jpg", "actors": ["Jean Arthur ()", "Humphrey Bogart ()", "James Cagney ()", "Gary Cooper ()", "Tony Curtis ()", "Marlene Dietrich ()", "Melvyn Douglas ()", "Tom Ewell ()", "Arlene Francis ()", "Greta Garbo ()", "Audrey Hepburn ()", "Alfred Hitchcock ()", "William Holden ()", "Jack Lemmon ()", "Ernst Lubitsch ()", "Shirley MacLaine ()", "Fred MacMurray ()", "Walter Matthau ()", "Ray Milland ()", "Marilyn Monroe ()", "Alma Reville ()", "Ginger Rogers ()", "Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff ()", "Barbara Stanwyck ()", "Gloria Swanson ()", "Erich von Stroheim ()", "Billy Wilder ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
