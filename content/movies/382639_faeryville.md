They decide that there is no reason in trying to fit-in, trying like \u2018everybody\u2019 to be \u2018somebody\u2019, choosing instead to mock the establishment, as pranksters \u2013 calling themselves The Nobodies. Now, what\u2019s their plan? Frankly, they have no idea, until Laer, a transfer student, joins them and takes them on a warpath of self-discovery and no return.  Faeryville is a dystopian teen movie, a stylish coming of age film about youth making sense of their idealistic dreams in our increasingly surreal world - a fictional manifestation of very real issues prevalent in the Post 9-11 world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i4JSIIZA4ShWVLw0JidOtP4njUd.jpg", "actors": ["Lyon Sim (Poe)", "Aaron Samuel Yong (Laer)", "Tanya Graham (Belle)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
