What better way to tell the story of man's connection to nature and the ocean than sea turtles, given our long-time fascination with them. The film explores the amazing world of turtles and man through thousands of years and how our futures are intertwined.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
