This forces Yank Justice and Bigfoot, Red &amp; Redder and Black Gold, and Professor D. &amp; Dilly and the Orange Blossom Special, into a cross-country trek to rendezvous with Ravenscroft at the Fountain and stop him. Ravenscroft is so powerful he can impose his will onto county sheriff's offices and get the group arrested. They are saved by Close McCall and his souped-up stunt car War Lord, so he joins the team after initial resistance the first time he tried.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9UTxWzF87Iww7UZVSAVdNbJDXYG.jpg", "actors": ["Susan Blu (Jennifer, Red, Redder)", "Wally Burr (Close McCall)", "Peter Cullen (Arthur Ravencroft)", "Lance LeGault (Yank Justice)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "vuf9zMqWp2U"}
