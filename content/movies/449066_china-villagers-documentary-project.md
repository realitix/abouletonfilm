Villages can never be so real if filmed by an outsider.  This video is a collection of ten short documentary films, each of ten minutes in length. They are ten funny films made by ten amateur villager filmmakers (age ranging from 24 to 59) selected from around China who are eager to discover their home villages through the DV lens.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
