Newlywed husband Abner Poodlebean faces the turkey his wife has prepared: she wants him to carve it at the table in front of her scowling family, and Abner has no idea how to proceed. The film's narrator has us cut away to the kitchen of chef M.O. Cullen who demonstrates the proper way to carve the bird, spoon out the stuffing, and lay out the platter. Back to Abner, who's missed Cullen's lesson, so he makes a fine mess. Can this marriage survive?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8XNWp3AnJv8Iich4CBwEALRUC78.jpg", "actors": ["Max O.
