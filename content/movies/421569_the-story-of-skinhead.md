Beginning in the late 1960s, Don fondly recalls a time of multiracial harmony as youngsters bonded over a love of ska, reggae and smart clothes as white working-class kids were attracted to Jamaican culture and adopted its music and fashions. But when far-right politics targeted skinheads in the 1970s and 1980s, an ugly intolerance emerged, and Don reveals how the once-harmonious subgroup has since struggled to shake this stigma.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/okIf3M7MYzp9kM2XCRJNMXrjrZc.jpg", "actors": ["Don Letts (Himself, Presenter)", "Pauline Black (Herself, Contributor)", "Kevin Rowland (Himself, Contributor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
