I found a film already conceived in the 1914 design; it was enough to follow the trajectories traced by Gaudi, imagine them as a labyrinth, reproduce the bursting of the mosaics through an analogous fracture of linear temporality. In the editing I tried to avoid showing passers-by. No human figure should get in the way of the appearance of that fantastic architecture. The stop-motion technique applied to the position and parameters of the camera still seems suitable for representing the undulating space of the park.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9DO5X1kXqyFgMuyAKWyLEOTpDLw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
