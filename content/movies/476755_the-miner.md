For 30 years, Alija, the miner, has been one of the many Bosnian immigrant workers. Due to the crisis, miners are losing jobs. Alija is sent to check an abandoned mine. His task is to quickly make sure the mine is empty before management sells the company. But in the mine, Alija finds hidden proof of executions after WWII. He is told to stop digging and report the mine empty. He decides to continue, although he is risking his job. Alija discovers thousands of executed people. He informs the police. He found women among the dead. Some of them were civilians, missing persons, just like his sister that was lost in the 1995 genocide in Bosnia. Alija is convinced the victims need to be brought out, identified and buried. But there is no interest in doing that. The mine is proclaimed a WWII military grave and walled in. The dead will stay unburied. Alija loses his job and struggles to preserve his dignity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nAwKEFWbOa6dVXGwyoERgEWvEDu.jpg", "actors": ["Boris Cavazza (Alija)", "Jure Henigman ()", "Leon Lu\u010dev ()", "Tin Marn ()", "Marina Redzepovic ()", "Zala \u0110uri\u0107-Ribi\u010d ()", "Nikolaj Burger ()", "Boris Petkovi\u010d ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
