The title character is a tall, leather-clad secret agent from the nation of Monica, skilled in assassination and acrobatics. Her mission is to infiltrate the strongholds of the neighboring country of Bregna, which is led by her sometimes-nemesis and sometimes-lover Trevor Goodchild. Monica represents a dynamic anarchist society, while Bregna embodies a police state[4]\u2014referred to on one occasion as a republic by Goodchild.[5] Although Bregna is shown to be repressive, in the first full-length episode, \"Utopia or Deuteranopia?\", Clavius, the president deposed by Goodchild, is described by a questioning journalist as having been democratically elected. In the same episode, an upper house of parliament is also mentioned by the character Gildemere.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1GABnkSOzHtRqd2BevFsq9qUXCM.jpg", "actors": ["Denise Poirier (\u00c6on Flux)", "John Rafter Lee (Trevor Goodchild)", "Julia Fletcher (Benzenhurst)", "Steffan Chirazi (Bambra)", "Alex Fernandez (Aemon)", "Paul Raci (Onan)", "Susan Turner-Cray (Hostess Judy)", "Japhet Asher (Clavius)", "Andrea Carvajal (Una)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
