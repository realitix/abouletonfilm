In spite of that, we still go out of our way at times to avoid the truth. Men avoid doctors and women deny evidence of adultery. While the truth often hurts, deceiving ourselves will ultimately only worsen the situation. In this nine-part DVD and eight-part companion study guide, we listen in as Jesus introduces some rather perplexing truth to seven individuals who had grown comfortable with their misinformed lifestyles and belief systems. Readers will discover firsthand that the truth can set you free. And for those who have the courage to embrace it, their lives will be changed forever.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7ktDKAeHizPnJe5sBR9TfQSo57h.jpg", "actors": ["Andy Stanley (Andy Stanley)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
