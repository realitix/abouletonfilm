Their focus was just about what you\u2019d expect from any 12-year-old: hit the ball, throw strikes, cross your fingers and then maybe \u2013 maybe \u2013 you\u2019ll win. Adults in the stands and watching from home saw a much broader field of play. The memories of American hostages and a crippling oil crisis were still fresh; the economic malaise of the late 1970s still lingered; and the new President was recovering from an assassination attempt even while confronting new threats from the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, back on that tiny baseball field in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, no American team had won a true international Little League World Series Championship in more than a decade. When the Kirkland players rushed from their dugout that day, they stepped onto a much bigger field than the one they saw.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iufHJciU76W76noUuYHfnUPVu3u.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [54737, 54683, 54742, 54672], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
