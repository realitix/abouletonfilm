Instead of truly tackling the fascinating topics of the time, it comes up to the edge and merely skirts around them. The skinheads are a problem, but they are never **our** problem, they're a mere periphery. The unemployment rate is sky high, but the lead stumbles into two jobs by the end of the first act.\r\n\r\nPerhaps these problems wouldn't be so stark, if the kid who is our eyes for this punk-journey, wasn't so much of an... unlikeable twat.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"}], "recommandations_id": [198318, 211085, 43334, 410311]}
