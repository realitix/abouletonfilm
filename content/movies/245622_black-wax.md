Interspliced between performance footage of Scott-Heron and his Midnight Band are vignettes of him walking around Washington D.C., spouting his views on then-President Reagan (dubbed \"Ray-Gun\") and generally dropping knowledge. The live performance features many of Scott-Heron's best-known hits, including \"Johannesburg,\" \"Winter in America,\" and \"Angel Dust,\" among others. Warm, intelligent, and insightful throughout, Scott-Heron is clearly enjoying himself and the opportunity to espouse his views. A must for any fan of Scott-Heron's, and definitely worth a look for fans of the funkier jazz music of the mid to late 1970's.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3WMQvonr6MmKhlXm09raGRBVkhf.jpg", "actors": ["Gil Scott-Heron (Himself)", "Glen 'Astro' Turner ()", "Gia Scott-Heron (Herself)", "Ed Brady (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
