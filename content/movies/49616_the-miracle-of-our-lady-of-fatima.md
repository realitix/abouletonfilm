The anticlerical government wishes to squelch the Church; reports of religious experiences are cause for serious concern. Yet the children stand by their story, and the message of peace and hope the Lady brings. In the last vision, attended by thousands of people, the Lady proves her reality with a spectacular miracle that is seen by everyone present. Based on actual events at Fatima in the summer of 1917.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lH7RycUGFnIlIpxfU4fuaJ6tHgi.jpg", "actors": ["Gilbert Roland (Hugo da Silva)", "Angela Clarke (Maria Rosa Ab\u00f3bora dos Santos)", "Frank Silvera (Council Administrator Arturo dos Santos)", "Jay Novello (Ant\u00f3nio Ab\u00f3bora dos Santos)", "Richard Hale (Father Ferreira)", "Norman Rice (Manuel Marto)", "Frances Morris (Ol\u00edmpia Marto (as Francis Morris))", "Carl Milletaire (District Magistrate (as Carl Millitaire))", "Susan Whitney (L\u00facia Ab\u00f3bora dos Santos)", "Sherry Jackson (Jacinta Marto)", "Sammy Ogg (Francisco Marto)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "5mJlZzQr298"}
