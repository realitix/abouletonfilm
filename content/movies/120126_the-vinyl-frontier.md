Joe status quo, boldly remixed and reassembled the toys of their parent's generation. Birthing a new format of toy and medium of artistic expression, these artists were the first to explore The Vinyl Frontier. A world where Art is Fun! By exploring a landscape inhabited by a wide range of artists, their creations, and obsessive collectors, the documentary examines the hybrid objects' artistic and commercial value, as well as the creative process of art-toy making. The Vinyl Frontier is a comprehensive look at a fresh and exciting art movement that anyone young at heart and imaginative can enjoy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uRkqTttDEGFMGhqcny27JsW2KXd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "BwsQ9fV11-Q"}
