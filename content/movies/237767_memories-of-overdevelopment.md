A stranger in a strange land struggling with old age, sexual desire and ultimately the impossibility for the individual to belong in any society. The film's narrative is a collage of flashbacks, daydreams, and hallucinations comprising live-action, animation, and newsreel footage assembled to suggest the way personal memory works, subjectively and emotionally.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7xMnr8VCjXDhfCvGc64wRiSAueq.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Clinton ()", "Fidel Castro ()", "Anna Gurji ()", "Jorge Molina ()", "Trent Harris ()", "Abraham Amkpa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
