Desperate for money, he takes his teammate Kevin\u2019s offer to deliver some cocaine. It is a set-up to take the business away from drug lord, Henry. Jack ends up in prison with Axel who was caught in the same deal.  Corrupt fight promoter, Parker, agrees to set up a fight between now blood rivals Kevin and Jack, and bets heavily on Jack. In order to ensure his success, he pumps Jack full of the experimental drug which brings out Jack\u2019s ultimate fighting power while making Kevin appear as a fearsome robot to Jack. Crazed by the drug, Jack does win the fight, and is finally able to give up the ring and seek a peaceful life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cAOIoAYSsNZtyrFPCt77yAjkxNT.jpg", "actors": ["Steve Brettingham ()", "Nick Brandon ()", "Frank Wheatley ()", "Clive Sayers ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
