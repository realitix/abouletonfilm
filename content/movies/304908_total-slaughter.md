Eight contestants face off live in front of a panel of celebrity judges at New York's Hammerstein Ballroom. Eminem is doing for battle rapping what UFC did for MMA. Despite hundreds of millions of online video views, rap battling is a fragmented space without a dominant leader. Total Slaughter takes a page from boxing and the UFC by combining well-promoted fights (battles), world class venues, TV production value, and top-level talent in this first of its kind event.
