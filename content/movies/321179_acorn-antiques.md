Viewers were gripped with the everyday dramas that beset Miss Babs (Celia Imrie), Berta (Victoria Wood) and the glamorous Mrs Overall (Julie Walters).  Now each thrilling episode is available together for the first time on DVD, including \"Babs and the Cup of Coffee\", \"Mrs Overall and her Apron\" and the memorable classic \"Berta coming through the Doorway\".  Re-live the drama as Mrs Overall serves up another batch of macaroons and Babs discusses the future of the shop. What will be this week's riveting cliff hanger? Will the set survive? Written by Victoria Wood, Acorn Antiques was Produced and Directed by Geoff Posner and first transmitted as part of Victoria Wood as Seen on TV\u2026 in January 1985.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vZYQYvDqUZAQ7NzF6gd0EwiO982.jpg", "actors": ["Victoria Wood (Berta)", "Celia Imrie (Babs)", "Julie Walters (Mrs. Overall)", "Susie Blake (Announcer)", "Duncan Preston (Clifford)", "Sam Kelly (Director)", "Maggie Steed (Marion Clune - Executive Producer)", "Deborah Grant (Crew Member)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
