In bootcamp their sergeant turns out to be the same man, whom they constantly vex and bewilder. When the boys are sent to the front lines and the sergeant is captured they must rescue him, which they do after doping themselves with laughing gas. At the end they get shot off into the sunset on a cannon shell.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/48D0Ea2BR2jzf85envoChhLUaUB.jpg", "actors": ["Curly Howard (Curly)", "Larry Fine (Larry)", "Moe Howard (Moe)", "Richard Fiske (The Sergeant)", "Evelyn Young (Sergeant's Wife)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [115934, 115992, 115924, 115993], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
