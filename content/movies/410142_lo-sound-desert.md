What basically started by revolving punk rock kids - hidden from narrow-minded authorities of suburban desert communities in the early 80s, became a vibe over the years. The film provides a unique insight into the history of the Coachella Valley music scene: From never-ending jams in the middle of the desert to headlining huge European stages - Desert Rock, often misinterpreted as musical genre continued its underground spread and became international treasure. Lo Sound Desert is narrated by Josh Homme, Brant Bjork, Mario Lalli and many others from bands like Queens Of The Stone Age, Kyuss, Fatso Jetson, Dalis Llama, Hornss, Fu Manchu etc.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pecGmdYP6JKsUFRCNClxlJlAJ7A.jpg", "actors": ["Joshua Homme (Himself)", "Brant Bjork (Himself)", "Nick Oliveri (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
