His one-night stand from last night has more information, but something is amiss.  Next is \"The Neighbor\", where a young widow is woken up with a late night call from her neighbor Ken. A light on in Renee's cottage sends her out in the storm to investigate.  \"Planet of the Monkeys\" finds four survivors of the ape-pocalypse struggling to cope with the inherent cuteness of their simian overlords.  Finally, in \"Number Nine\" a downtrodden security guard has taken an interest in the exploits of infamous serial killer, and struggles to stay sane as his murderous daydreaming brings him to attempt to live out his dark fantasies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8U9xxGo6B1lKnv00MU109HwmoFH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "jAIhsGkn5p4"}
