Then, peplums take root at Cinecitt\u00e0 studios, in Rome, where cheap cinema is produced with bodybuilders as heroes. The genre decays in the late 1960s, but rises again decades later, when a modern classic is released in 2000.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vN2e6BqUA7ZauWY6dhlnIWRahV0.jpg", "actors": ["Julien Bocher (Himself - Narrator (voice))", "Herv\u00e9 Lacroix (Himself - Narrator (voice))", "Romain Debord (Himself - Narrator (voice))", "Douglas Wick (Himself - Producer)", "David Franzoni (Himself - Screenwriter)", "Laurent Aknin (Himself - Historian)", "Pierre Baron (Himself - Historian)", "Claude Aziza (Himself - Historian)", "Floren Fourcart (Himself - Historian)", "Lou Ferrigno (Himself - Actor)", "John Milius (Himself - Director)", "Oliver Stone (Himself - Director)", "Michael Douglas (Himself (archive footage))", "Russell Crowe (Himself (archive footage))", "Ridley Scott (Himself (archive footage))", "Charlton Heston (Himself (archive footage))", "Cecil B.
