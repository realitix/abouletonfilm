You know, instead of just giving Robin the week off, and because it\u2019s impossible for two people to have a broken arm at the same time. The whole event comes together when Batman bewilders the world by wearing a costume that\u2019s made up of straight-up rainbow stripes. Batman\u2019s plan works, and all is right in the Silver Age world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/AhzUst82dsqO4ZU1alDY9o0S9E7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
