Kailash, a 22,000-foot-tall holy mountain so deep in the Himalayas of Tibet that only a few thousand devoted souls make the pilgrimage to it each year. Following ordinary Tibetans who undertake the sacred trek, this program examines why those faithful few who circumambulate the peak believe that the journey helps them attain spiritual enlightenment.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
