Challenging the meaning of freedom, love, patriotism and ultimately the human condition, it tries to understand, on their own terms, the psychology and popular imaginary of the North Korean people and the political ideology of absolute love which continues to drive the nation towards its uncertain future.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nS8gWS9E46sx8QMihVaHDmhP0m4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
