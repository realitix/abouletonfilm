From D+1 through to attacking back into the Falaise Pocket, this unique division constantly thwarted Montgomery's plans and exacted a terrible price on the Allies for every mile gained. Formed from 'volunteers' from the Hitler Youth Movement in the aftermath of Stalingrad, this division of boys, aged 17 on recruitment into the SS, came of age and were declared fully operational just before D Day. Coming from a fully militarized society they made exceptional and highly committed soldiers but with officers and non-commissioned officers from the Leibstandarte commanding them, they were to become a ruthless and brutal arm of the Nazi fighting machine that battled towards the Eastern Front. Both Hitlerjugend's alleged atrocities and their remarkable doggedness in battle made them a loathed but grudgingly respected opponent to all who fought them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pCQ6Qg7IpjAlEiZ1S25H7IZEuEp.jpg", "actors": ["Andrew Duff (Presenter)", "Tim Saunders (Presenter)", "Richard Hone (Presenter)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "VMCk9zzeh78"}
