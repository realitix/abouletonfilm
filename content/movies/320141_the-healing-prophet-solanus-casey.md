He was a beloved Capuchin Friar who many believe had the ability to heal the sick and prophesize the future. Stories abound of how Solanus' prayers made miracles happen. He was a role model for his time and continues to be so for people today, which is why he has become a candidate for Sainthood. Solanus Casey was born in 1870 on a Wisconsin farm to Irish immigrant parents. He had a very religious upbringing, along with 15 brothers and sisters, two of whom died during the Diphtheria Epidemic.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
