Immediately the head increases in size and continues to enlarge until it becomes truly colossal while making faces. The chemist, fearing to burst it, opens a cock in the tube. The head immediately contracts and resumes its original size. He then calls his assistant and informs him of his discovery. The assistant, wishing to experiment for himself, seizes the bellows and blows into the head with all his might. The head swells until it bursts with a crash, knocking over the two experimenters.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9oqTGZcQf0UwsbA8mKPeJzPRJ5e.jpg", "actors": ["Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [49273, 49296, 49280, 49275], "youtube_key": "Yb3uYXXB4wY"}
