However, this painterly film is so filled with striking and surreal imagery that it would be misleading to say that the story is of any great importance in relation to that.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aU6GrcGGbIUSZNDpgU9usD5Xq0z.jpg", "actors": ["Jeanne Moreau (Woman)", "Yelena Solovey (Silent Film Star)", "Natalya Leble (Natasha)", "Victor Sibilyov (Young Man)", "Gregory Hlady ((as Grigoriy Gladiy))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
