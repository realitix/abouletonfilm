This darkly funny documentary checks in with former punks Eddie and Mitch, who detail their late-'80s Lower Haight surroundings, and surveys the tapes' influence on an array of underground artists.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dZhG1xwvBua9GJFTazk9OKP0zxi.jpg", "actors": ["Ivan Brunetti (Himself)", "Daniel Clowes (Himself)", "Mitch Deprey (Mitch D)", "Peter Haskett (Pete)", "Raymond Huffman (Ray)", "Mike Mitchell (Himself)", "Henry S.
