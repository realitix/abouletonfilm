The Great European Disaster Movie  Authored documentary by Italian director Annalisa Piras and former editor of The Economist Bill Emmott, which explores the crisis facing Europe. Through case studies of citizens in different countries, the film explores a range of factors that have led to the present crisis, economic and identity challenges across Europe. High-level experts analyse how and why things are going so wrong.  The film includes fictional scenes, set in a post-EU future, which feature archaeologist Charles Granda (played by Angus Deayton) travelling on a flight through a menacing storm, explaining to a child passenger what the EU was. Sombre, thought-provoking and witty, the film frames Europe through the eyes of those who have most at stake - the Europeans themselves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4uhosf9hhxfTcDwVvavfZqDCC7K.jpg", "actors": ["Angus Deayton (Charles Granda)", "Flavia Piras Trow (Jane Monetti)", "John Arthur (Adam Smith)", "Neerja Naik (Hostess)", "Peter Salmon (Air Marshal)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [161545, 42433, 320316, 11010], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
