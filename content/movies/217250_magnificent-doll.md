In a flashback in 1814, while packing her belongings in preparation of evacuating the White House because of the impending British invasion of Washington D.C., she thinks back on her childhood, her first marriage, and later romances with two very different politicians, Aaron Burr and his good friend James Madison, her future second husband.  She plays each against the other, not only for romantic reasons, but also to influence the shaping of the young country. By manipulating Burr's affections, she helps Thomas Jefferson win the presidency, and eventually she becomes First Lady of the land herself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iLOSo11Dmt4KxGyiruyVTLctWle.jpg", "actors": ["Ginger Rogers (Dolly Madison)", "David Niven (Aaron Burr)", "Burgess Meredith (James Madison)", "Grandon Rhodes (Thomas Jefferson)", "Peggy Wood (Mrs. Payne)", "Stephen McNally (John Todd)", "Robert Barrat (Mr. Payne)", "Frances E.
