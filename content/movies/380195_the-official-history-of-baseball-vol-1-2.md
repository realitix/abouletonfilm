We may recall great moments from other sports, but rarely are they remembered as an integral part of our lives as is baseball. Ask a Pittsburgh fan where he was for Bill Mazeroski's home run. Mention Bucky Dent to a New Yorker - or Bill Buckner to a resident of Boston. Is there a Toronto fan alive who wasn't jumping just as high as Joe Carter in 1993? Baseball is passed down from one generation to another in a patient process that, in some ways, never ends. It's been this way for more than a century and will undoubtedly continue for generations to come. Contained herein, are the most memorable moments from baseball's first 125 years, each moment guaranteed to kindle a reminder of a special time - a special place. That's what baseball is all about.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6AWDxXuiV5wRLe6hwD85fWIMzET.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
