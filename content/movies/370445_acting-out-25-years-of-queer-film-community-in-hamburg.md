The filmmakers have filmed, interviewed, gleaned the archives, watched hours of footage and edited reams of material into a small masterpiece. With its gorgeous shots and sublime soundtrack, the documentary entertainingly brings across both the unique atmosphere and 25-year history, and above all, illuminates the complex mesh that both forms and carries the festival. On another note, the film tries to detect the ways a queer film festival like this has functioned as a platform for unheard voices - and continues to do so in the present. For some people, its sole existence has been a life changing momentum.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sSl14uDO4LJa2zdfyHW46X7omQL.jpg", "actors": ["Angelina Maccarone (Angelina Maccarone)", "Alice Nkom (Alice Nkom)", "Axel Ranisch (Axel Ranisch)", "Texas Starr (Texas Starr)", "Wieland Speck (Wieland Speck)", "Monika Treut (Monika Treut)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
