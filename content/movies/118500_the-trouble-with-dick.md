His work seems to be missing one key ingredient: half-nude chicks. In an effort to cure his writer's block (and get some much needed inspiration), Dick rents a room from a couple of women who waste no time hitting on him. Talk about invoking the muse! This lighthearted romp won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iyBCqLVrT01N0Xu5lydtZFZ8b8x.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Villard (Dick Kendred)", "Susan Dey (Diane)", "Elaine Giftos (Sheila Dibble)", "Elizabeth Gorcey (Haley Dibble)", "David Clennon (Lars)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
