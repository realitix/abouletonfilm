Lenny Babbitt has his identity and manhood challenged when his wife Tracy leaves him for a female doctor named Iris who has been treating their autistic son Isaac. After losing his job, and wife to a woman no less -- Lenny's dad Jack offers him a job at his pawn shop where he must re-examine his identity, manhood and sense of self after meeting Chelsea, a young, free-spirited pistol that lives life on two wheels. In the end, Lenny realizes that there are no absolutes... only one's faith, sense of self and family -- no matter how it's constituted or defined by society.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/128hMjyopvlewYIpmOcNXQOMvNV.jpg", "actors": ["Chris Bruno (Lenny)", "Marie Avgeropoulos (Chelsea)", "Daphne Zuniga (Tracy)", "Mark Margolis (Landon)", "Dylan Bruno (Max)", "John O'Hurley (Father David)", "Helen Slater (Iris)", "Jack Horan (Isaac)", "Eric Roberts (Jack)", "Sean McNabb (Fang)", "Marina Voruz (Girl with Watches)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
