The result of this formal method is an abstract digital artwork that not only manages to convince thanks to its mathematical precision, but primarily also due to its incredible beauty and surprising narrative structure. Comparison to the classic abstract films from the 1920s by, for instance, Ruttmann, seems justified.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1lam2SCrQIrAGaU7y7IicUzIK7f.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
