They made it back but the coal fell on the tlacuache's tale, making him run scared around the mountain leaving traces of fire everywhere.Thanks to these animals we now have fire and the Tlacuache's tale looks the way we now know.That's how the Yoremes tell it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ukOdqUaWmOoRThCOezgZek7qixu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
