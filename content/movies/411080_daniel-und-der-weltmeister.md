He constantly drives around on his three-wheeler, knowing that he wants to become a famous racing cyclist \u2013 just as fast and famous as the world champion T\u00e4ve Schur. But until then he has to struggle with the difficulties of growing up. His mother, for example, wants him to drink milk \u2013 even though Daniel does not find this very suitable for world champions. To get affirmation, Daniel starts searching for his role model T\u00e4ve. On the way, he has some interesting encounters and experiences many adventures. When he finally meets T\u00e4ve at a race, Daniel is astonished to watch him pleasurably drink a bottle of milk after an outstanding victory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jNs5P1LA9VQf6R9Jkt6lr2Gc15b.jpg", "actors": ["Rolf Schmidt (Daniel)", "Gustav-Adolf Schur (T\u00e4ve)", "Karla Runkehl (Daniels Mutter)", "Fred Delmare (ein Schweizer)", "Alexander Papendiek ()", "Fred Mahr ()", "Hans-Joachim Hegewald ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
