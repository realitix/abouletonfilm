A man stretches out his arm and grasps the night view of a distant city NEW TOKYO. He and his female companion rush down the length of his arm toward the city lights. The work is defined by a speedy style and comical pictures that express the sense of omnipotence derived from coming into a large sum of money and the folly of letting happiness slip through your hands.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lQPR5R0Q2jSz27X8yrVzGhzUF7b.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
