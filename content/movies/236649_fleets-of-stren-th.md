Just then, the enemy attacks. He remains at attention, even as a bomb throws him to the top of the mast, where his commander finally notices and orders him to get the planes. Popeye fires on them, but this only draws return fire. He eats his spinach, then turns into a plane himself and attacks.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9SBp14SiFXJSvwQUMMrkjr9VaXT.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Mercer (Popeye (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
