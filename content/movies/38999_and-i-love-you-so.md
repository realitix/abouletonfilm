Now, seven months later, Lara is still in mourning. Every time a loved one died, someone else was there to cushion the blow. When her mother followed six years later, there was the rest of the family. But when her husband died, no one could offer any consolation - not her siblings, not her in-laws, not her friends. Not only was he the love of her life, he had also become her life. It would have been better if she died with him. In the meantime, her business -has taken a nosedive. She's also deep in debt with her unpaid condo and car mortgages. With all her predicament, how would Oliver and Chris figure in her life? Will she finally move on?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3Ke0PdOhdRtk4LpHUQWwYLNw2R8.jpg", "actors": ["Bea Alonzo (Lara)", "Sam Milby (Chris)", "Derek Ramsay (Oliver)", "Nikki Gil (Audrey Cruz)", "Maricar Reyes (Rachel)", "Candy Pangilinan (Teacher Paula)", "Dick Israel (Jun Panlilio)", "Angel Jacob (Jane)", "Cacai Bautista (Teacher Lani)", "Janna Dominguez (Teacher Teresa)", "Coney Reyes (Kate Cruz)", "Rj Ledesma (Mike Panlilio)", "Cai Cortez (Teacher Grace)", "Gilleth Sandico (Margie)", "Mike Austria (Fred)", "George Lim (Mr. Chua)", "Hyubs Azarcon (Store Owner)", "Ricky Rivero (Ricky)", "Ni\u00f1a Dolino (Sexy Girl 1)", "Kristel Moreno (Sexy Girl 3)", "Savanah Lamsen (Sexy Girl 2)", "Gail Nicolas (Sexy Girl 4)", "Gemma Fitzgerald (Sexy Girl 5)", "Madeleine Nicolas (Widow 1)", "Erlinda Villalobos (Widow 2)", "Cha-Cha Ca\u00f1ete (Pre-school Student)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "B1o0FAf-qAw"}
