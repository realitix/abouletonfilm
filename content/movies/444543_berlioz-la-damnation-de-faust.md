Sylvain Cambreling sensitively conducts the Staatskapelle Berlin, and two excellent choirs' vocal contributions should not go unnoticed. (However, condolences to those choir members stuck in that ludicrous cylinder.) Both visual presentation and sound are, as usual for Arthaus Musik discs, first-rate; only the staging itself comes off as less than worthwhile.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sBCF7ybz6Lqt0c0BMaoVeXcDy9J.jpg", "actors": ["Vesselina Kasarova (Marguerite)", "Paul Groves (Faust)", "Willard White (M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s)", "Andreas Macco (Brander)", "Sylvain Cambreling (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
