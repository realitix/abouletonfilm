The title refers to the fact that the band were touring inside the Iron Curtain (countries within the Eastern Bloc of the Soviet Union); unusual given the area's separation from the West due to the then-ongoing Cold War. Aside from two promotional videos from the album Powerslave, the video also contains live tracks and interviews with band members.  Originally issued on VHS/Beta/LaserDisc/VHD in 1984, this was long out of print until being reissued in its expanded format as a bonus feature of the Live After Death DVD release in 2008", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mPEWlcWmJwfxA2MfpH1U7k3st5T.jpg", "actors": ["Steve Harris (Self (Bassist))", "Bruce Dickinson (Self (Vocalist))", "Dave Murray (Self (Guitarist))", "Adrian Smith (Self (Guitarist))", "Nicko McBrain (Self (Drummer))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
