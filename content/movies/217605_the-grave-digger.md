So the story ignites the imagination only to be slowed down by the images and stops the viewer from taking a flight of fantasy. I have always been searching for an intrinsically different tool in filmmaking. One that could record space in its temporal progression. I would never have thought it existed!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mkKPOkcUVgCrGgjxsfTsspmiVgr.jpg", "actors": ["Zolt\u00e1n Mucsi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
