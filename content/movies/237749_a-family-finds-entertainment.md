Starring Trecartin\u2019s family and friends, and the artist himself in a plethora of outrageous roles, A Family Finds Entertainment chronicles the story of mixed up teenager Skippy and his adventures in \u2018coming out\u2019. In this over the top celebration of queerness, Trecartin\u2019s film mines the bizarre and endearing in an unabashed pastiche of \u2018bad tv\u2019 tropes. Cheesy video special effects, dress-up chess costumes, desperate scripts, and \u2018after school special\u2019 melodrama combine in the fluency of youth-culture lingo, reflecting a generation both damaged and affirmed by media consumption.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/25TUrBScZCZHq8FtX8gj7s6m709.jpg", "actors": ["Ryan Trecartin (Shin / Skippy / Closet Monster / Booty Girl / Snowy White Girl / Video Face)", "Lizzie Fitch (Cosmos Bitch / Linda / Fisher Woman / Orange Tamber)", "Alison Powell (Phalangena)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
