Sporting the latest fashions and trendy hairdos, they na\u00efvely observe and criticise the modern consumer society, advertising, fancy boats and summer cottages, country dances, barbecues, and any other phenomena that were supposed to bother angry young intellectuals in those days. The plot and the political agenda are delivered with a cheerful, tongue-in-cheek mixture of documentary observations, fake TV commercials, fake interviews, philosophical voiceovers and titles, and a jazzy soundtrack by the progressive rock group Wigwam.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d1DjNbDMYEx4WDmPqVrjuGJ6ls3.jpg", "actors": ["Titta Karakorpi (Susanna, photo model)", "Hannu Oravisto (Veli, Susannas brother)", "Veikko Honkanen (marketing chief Jarmo Nieminen)", "Petra Frey (insurance clerk Katri Pellinen)", "Eero Melasniemi (Eki, Katris boyfriend)", "Ritva Arvelo (Mrs. Hein\u00e4)", "Topi Reinikka (Mr. Hein\u00e4, advertiser)", "Iris-Lilja Lassila (Lady of the House)", "Lauri-Juhani Ruuskanen (vicar of Hirvensalmi)", "Matti Ruohola (Pekka, manager)", "Jaakko Talaskivi (interviewer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
