His father Cenzo (Luigi Maria Burruano) lost his job after a local chemical plant closed; shortly afterward, Cenzo's wife Paola (Anita Zagaria) dumped him for a politician. Fed up, Vince travels to the beach town of Pescara and lands a job as a junior cook at a tourist resort. While there, he falls in love with Genny (Nicole Grimaudo), a waitress plagued by a phobia of traveling. Just as the romance begins to take off, Cenzo appears at Vince's doorstep demanding that his son help him get Paola back. ~ Tracie Cooper, Rovi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cmc9OqPhwJe8esYalP4EfvDZSAE.jpg", "actors": ["Nicole Grimaudo (Genny)", "Elio Germano (Vince)", "Luigi Maria Burruano (Cenzo)", "Anita Zagaria (Paola)", "Myriam Catania (Elena)", "Luigi Ciavarelli (Titta)", "Rosa Pianeta (Anita)", "Viviana Strambelli ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
