That's not it, so far he had failed to take the right project to work with. His films are either having no story or a silly concept and his roles among the worst. I could have liked this film if it was done by some other young actor. It looked a decent storyline on how an aspiring DJ is fighting to make progress. Living with his friends, then suddenly an opportunity knocks and followed by some issues surround it that should be solved to see the success in his passion in the music. So the remaining is to reveal how the things go on for him.\r\n\r\nToo slow narration, and it is being a music genre, a little soulless. Yeah, there's no rhythm. All we have seen a DJ while performing, but what his life would be like is what this film was focused on. Directional debute for a documentary filmmaker and he should make a couple of things right for his next film, including casting right actors and preparing an engaging screenplay. Some people might like the film, but not for me. This is completely an ignorable film.\r\n\r\n_4/10_"}], "recommandations_id": [225565, 77877, 37950, 286565], "youtube_key": "gZzAeYWXFpk"}
