When the blinding sun coming through the window suddenly forces him back into life with Mitzi and Teresita\u2014but without Teresa\u2014he asks what good it is if she\u2019s reincarnated into a flower or a butterfly if what the girls need is a mother. Can God be so cruel so as to deprive a young girl of her mother\u2019s touch? And so reality turns into dream\u2014or is it the other way around? And she is back again. Could Teresa still be alive?
