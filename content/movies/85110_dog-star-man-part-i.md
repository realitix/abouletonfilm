We watch the sun. We see a bearded man climbing up the mountain through the snow. He carries an ax, and he's accompanied by a dog. His labors continue. There is no soundtrack. Images rush past - water, trees, and surfaces too close up to distinguish. He struggles. A fire burns. Nature, in long shots and magnified, is formidable and silent. It's tough going; he carries on. In a capillary, blood flows.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xCEUsoTIGR5jP5vkgRIFLZA3ZbU.jpg", "actors": ["Stan Brakhage ()", "Jane Brakhage ()"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "talisencrw", "content": "I adored this, quite reasonably regarded as one of the finest post-silent short experimental works. Confused why it's regarded as five separate films, though.\r\n\r\nSeen on my university library's Criterion Collection DVD of Brakhage's anthology, Volume 1.
