{"tmdb_id": 405512, "title": "The Peter Sellers Story", "original_title": "The Peter Sellers Story", "slug_title": "the-peter-sellers-story", "date": "1995-07-09", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "Told in his own words, and including many well-known personalities from Stanley Kubrick, Sophia Loren and Robert Wagner to members of the Royal Family, in particular Princess Margaret and Prince Charles, this revealing film builds a fascinating and definitive record of a unique genius. Using a unique collection of his own home movies shot between 1948 and 1977 and discovered years after his death, this film presents an intriguing and intimate portrait of Peter Sellers.  A DVD was issued entitled \"Peter Sellers - As He Filmed It\" which is a 97 minute edit of this original broadcast. Not long after the 3 part documentary series was broadcast it was pulled due to \"licencing\" issues over home-movie footage used that the Sellers estate had not agreed to. The BBC lost the case I believe and thus the reason for the 97mins DVD that was then later released excising the vast majority of the rare illuminating footage.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
