Scandalous exposes which have even more shocking repercussions for the paper's sales manager, Okomoto, and his elegant wife Shizuyo. Ensnared in the escalating war of wits and chains between the sadistic cult master and Kumiko, his former sex slave, Shizuyo finds herself strung in the rope bonds of a ruthless game that mixes sensuality with humiliation. Could it be that Shizuyo's only hope of release may come in the form of her own husband's mistress? Or is that exactly what the Devil has been planning on all along?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dmvfVQYBMoqmY3IcWxTmuXCH391.jpg", "actors": ["Chihiro Koganezaki ()", "Arisa Matsumoto ()", "Hitoshi Kajiki ()", "Jir\u00f4 Miyaji ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
