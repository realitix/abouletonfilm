In a radical dismissal of todays so called post-political era, he mobilizes the paradox of universal truth urging us to dare to enact the impossible. It is a characteristic virtuoso performance, moving promiscuously from subject to subject but keeping the larger argument in view.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gko0OCDK3JL45chkpBlg4aEUmlx.jpg", "actors": ["Slavoj \u017di\u017eek (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [24234, 73241, 67857], "youtube_key": "KdpudWL5i68"}
