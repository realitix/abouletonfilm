Astonished by the exotic flavor of the meat, the three men decide to buy Igor, a donkey, in order to eat him. Takeo, Hiroshi and Jun rejoice in their gastronomic project as they are passing though streets filled with wreaths, candles and other Christmas decorations in the Komoro City shopping area.
