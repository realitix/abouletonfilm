For the first time they see how their 'successful' marriage is far away for a marriage truly fitting. This film includes everything. Humor, emotion, hyperbole, a murder and a rich cast of popular Greek actors. Focus on the original sin of Adam and Eve, this movie is 'trying' to make a commentary especially on the problematic marriage, but also on bad relationships. Does not succeed, precisely because it does not actually saying anything new. However, while remaining on the surface, there is a sincere disposition towards the situations presented.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ybpTltHWnQRb0BQn7XJN8N11uTS.jpg", "actors": ["Krateros Katsoulis ()", "Vladimiros Kiriakidis ()", "Dafni Lambrogianni ()", "Katerina Papoutsaki ()", "Yannis Zouganelis ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [80645, 64672, 47702], "youtube_key": "d5DQ6MI6BX4"}
