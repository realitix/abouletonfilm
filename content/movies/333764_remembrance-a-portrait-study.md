My mother is sitting in a wicker chair with an ostrich feather boa, a grey worsted wool skirt, a silk belt. For her portrait, I used \u2018All Cried Out\u2019 by Dusty Springfield...I was advised by Gregory Markopoulos not to play the music. Because Gregory didn\u2019t think it was proper.\u201d - Edward Owens", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7g1JXwii12OMp58Vy3qfbizdN8j.jpg", "actors": ["Mildered Owens ()", "Irene Collins ()", "Nettie Thomas ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
