But the real breakthrough is slow in coming.  Jeanette especially desperately needs a big success, since her friend, the journalist Stephan, is about to lose his job.  When the two have their chance to take a ride in a posh car during a shooting, Jeanette slams on the throttle and the two friends take off.  Their aimless journey takes them to a fashionable winter sports\u2019 hotel, where Jeanette reserves a name under \u201cThe Countess of Monte Christo\u201d.  Everything\u2019s going dandy; no one suspects a thing.  That is, until two impostors, Rumowski and \u201cThe Baron\u201d take residence in the same hotel.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zqCHkYxrW7xPnJsEtyp9i7hD03J.jpg", "actors": ["Brigitte Helm (Jeanette Heider, Filmkomparsin)", "Rudolf Forster (Rumowski, Hochstapler)", "Lucie Englisch (Mimi, Filmkomparsin)", "Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens (Der 'Baron' Hochstapler)", "Oskar Sima (Aufnahmeleiter Spitzkopf)", "Mathias Wieman (Stephan Riehl, Journalist)", "Theo Lingen (Etagenkellner)", "Flockina von Platen (Filmdiva)", "Hans Junkermann (Hoteldirektor)", "Max G\u00fclstorff (Zeitungsverleger)", "Ludwig St\u00f6ssel ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
