In this process he goes missing. Marjan, a middle-aged, middle-class Tehran resident and Amir's daughter, is distraught when her father goes missing. She goes to see her estranged husband, Aman, who reluctantly agrees to look for Amir, while Marjan watches over Aman's house, which is being renovated. Aman enlists the aid of his old friend, Atta, and the two drive off in search of Amir, who presumably took off to find an old friend whom he seems to have forgotten died years earlier.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Ehsan Amani (Aman)", "Farzaneh Arastoo ()", "Dariush Asadzade ()", "Habib Dehghan Nasab ()", "Shahrokh Foroutanian ()", "Jamshid Mashayekhi ()", "Fatemah Motamed-Aria ()", "Hediyeh Tehrani ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
