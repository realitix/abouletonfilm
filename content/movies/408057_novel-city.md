Thornton shoots from her window of the Jin Jiang Hotel in Shanghai, the site of Mao's 1972 meeting with Nixon, and projects images from the earlier movie, creating a layered landscape of alienation and dislocation.\r - Description from EAI", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3VG0eg5zFP9pZH9vBB7HbB8a4Fa.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
