For the most part, it's a city where kids have defined what hardcore is for themselves instead of trying to fit in with what's popular elsewhere. NO DELUSIONS doesn't attempt to cover the entirety of Chicago hardcore, but touches on a few of the various styles and sounds from the late '80s through the late '00s with an emphasis on how it has evolved into the scene it is today.  Featuring: Plan of Attack, The Killer, Harms Way, Weekend Nachos, Punch in the Face, The Repos, Sin Orden, Extinction, Racetraitor, Charles Bronson, Los Crudos, MK-Ultra, Billingsgate, Even Score, and more!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tD5EW3c6mswhc4men4X8fXLKJ9D.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
