Many of the team from King Kong reteam to make this film, and undoubtedly it's pretty much the same plotting only with a different resolution.\r\n\r\nHowever, the effects work is still magical, harking back to a time when geniuses like Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen sweated buckets to make the magic move on the screen. Mighty Joe, the huge Gorilla of the title, is beautifully realised, full of expressions and emotions, he even has time for some sense of humour traits.\r\n\r\nAction is never far away, with models and sets destroyed with brute force, while plenty of beings get flung about to emphasise the madness of it all. Narratively like Kong there's still themes of greed and ignorance, the tampering with Mother Nature a big mistake, which all leads to a thrilling finale that in turn leads to something to savour.\r\n\r\nKiddie Kong? Who cares! A wonderful film of skill and guile, of charm and brains. Go Joe Go! 8/10"}], "recommandations_id": [115972, 43440, 41787, 27629], "youtube_key": "foWMDiVLaqo"}
