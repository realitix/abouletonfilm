She begins to tell the story of how her parents discovered their son Randall was autistic and how each reacted to that. Her mother had three more kids, all daughters, \"the perfect children.\" The controversy over that and Randall's treatment pulls the parents apart. It also forces Nina and her older brother Mack to re-evaluate their relationship with each other and each parent.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6Kd3sYS4NPza98Zi4dY496t7du3.jpg", "actors": ["Anjelica Huston (Lainey Eberlin)", "Sam Neill (David Eberlin)", "Kyra Sedgwick (Nina Eberlin)", "Dermot Mulroney (Mack)", "Jamie Harrold (Randall)", "Sarah Campbell (Liddie (9))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
