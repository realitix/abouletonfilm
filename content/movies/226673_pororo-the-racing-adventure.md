On the airplane are some turtles being shipped to Northpia to deliver ice sleds, or racing ice cars. Nevertheless, Pororo and his friends believe that the turtles are racers, and the turtles end up giving the gang at Pororo Village some lessons and passing on the championship spirit. In the end, Pororo and his friends follow the turtles to Northpia to participate in the race. Upon arriving at icily beautiful Northpia's race, Pororo and his friends wind up unlikely front-runners, ahead of the polar bears, and make it to the finals. However, a more complicated course awaits Pororo and his friends- as does their strongest adversary yet.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d0lq51Mfv4Hs3lQnnbr9zTWIps3.jpg", "actors": ["Chris Jai Alex (Pobo)", "Anthony Anderson (Fufu)", "Zhang Anqi (Eddy)", "Drake Bell (White Tiger)", "Wu Di (Crong)", "Ham Su-jung (Eddy)", "Jon Heder (Mango)", "Zhan Jia (Pororo)", "Hwan Chin Kim (Poby)", "Lee Mi-ja (Crong)", "Lee Sun (Pororo)", "Dallas Lovato (Gucci Bear)", "Walter Masterson (The Wolf)", "Jay Mohr (Chip Quackers)", "Patrick M\u00f6lleken (Eddy)", "Andy Lau (Sam (Voice))", "Nick Cheung (Lilin (Voice))", "Jay Mohr (Chip Quackers (voice))", "Rob Schneider (USA Manager)", "Mychal Simka (Tor the Walrus / Various Roles (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "yX7J1C4K7R0"}
