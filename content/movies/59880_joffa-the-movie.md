From his iconic gold jacket to the famous winners circle, Joffa displays a truly unrivaled level of passion for his club, the mighty Magpies. JOFFA THE MOVIE explores his world and finds it is not all black and white. From revving up his team in Melbourne\u2019s Reclink homeless football league to being unceremoniously ushered out of Father Bob\u2019s church and marching towards Joffa\u2019s holy grail \u2013 \u2018Celtic Park \u2013 Glasgow\u2019, Joffa's is quite a journey. Outside football Joffa and his mate Shane efforts at small business with \u2018J&amp;S Labor Workforce\u2019 make you think he should just stick to supporting! This is a story that explores mateship, trust and human spirit, told with a tongue firmly in its cheek.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ow3TtFztQL1l0fo1JWHcqNYUN84.jpg", "actors": ["Jeff Corfe (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
