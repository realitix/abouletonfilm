Based on a violent and erotic biblical story, Saint-Sa\u00ebns\u2019s opera \u2013 composed in 1877, much to Liszt\u2019s insistence \u2013 would not be performed at the Palais Garnier until fifteen years later. This first Parisian performance in 1892 included the hitherto unperformed \u201cDance Of The Priestesses\u201d. Nevertheless, it became one of the most performed French operas in the world, together with Faust and Carmen. Conducted by Philippe Jordan, this new production brings back a repertoire masterpiece that has not been performed at the Paris Opera for twenty-five years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7Opx8Oj8nPV89Y6qS8UhKCio6gt.jpg", "actors": ["Anita Rachvelishvili (Dalila)", "Aleksandrs Antonenko (Samson)", "Egils Silins (The Great Priest of Dagon)", "Nicolas Test\u00e9 (Abim\u00e9lech)", "Nicolas Cavallier (Old Hebrew)", "Philippe Jordan (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "tRqA05CNyuo"}
