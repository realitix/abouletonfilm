But unfortunately the acting, or rather the dialogue are unnatural and lack spontaneity. I've read the book and liked it, but the film was quite different. Also, it takes some time until the pieces fall into place and the beginning, despite being \"spiced\" with eerie dream sequences, is rather boring. In conclusion, this is a very decent movie and, particularly, a beautifully shot one. For those who like handsome movies, it is a must. The fact it was made before the fall of the Communist regime doesn't necessarily means it's aesthetically subdued. Even to modern standard, it's very convincing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1B3DwdmWja3KfnLyRkUFDvJ3tdc.jpg", "actors": ["Stefan Iordache (The Doctor)", "Gheorghe Cozorici (Senator Faranga)", "Ion Ritiu (Puiu Faranga)", "Anca Nicola (Madalina)", "Corneliu G\u00eerbea (Andrei)", "Gilda Marinescu (mama Madalinei)", "Alexandru Dobrescu (Prefectul)", "Ulrike Blome ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
