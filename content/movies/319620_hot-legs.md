The longer this goes on, the more it feels like someone's excuse to have two men get naked and wrestle each other for his pleasure. It has the quality of a student production. Nothing is as good as it needs to be--not the script, not the cinematography, not the acting--but the general idea is enough to keep  your interest. The above's all understandable considering that it was shot with no budget and over a weekend, in what amounts to one long take. However, that's not an excuse."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "GOXlXEagpb0"}
