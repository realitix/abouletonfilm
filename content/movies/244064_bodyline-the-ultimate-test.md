Self-confessed cricket tragic and comedian Adam Zwar will try to discover what happened at the crease and chart the wider social and cultural implications of the controversy by enlisting historians, sports scientists, and cricket stars to simulate the actual events.  Is there more to the legend of Bodyline than we think?  Adam is going back in time to live out a childhood fantasy or two. He is going to use machines, fancy cameras, and the latest in computer graphics. Modern day players will help him prepare. Adam will witness the real damage a high speed cricket ball can do. In the end, Adam will be on his own - with no helmet, no modern padding, and just a bat for protection. How will he handle this ultimate test?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oDXmtB6hSWHQQr1NKGxHpRxdzfE.jpg", "actors": ["Adam Zwar (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
