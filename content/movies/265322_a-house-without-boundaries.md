It is never quite clear whether The Organization is part of the government, a secret society, or something else. Whatever it is, it is powerful, and does not take disobedience lightly. He is sent on an assignment to Bilbao to determine what has become of a lad his age, a former member. He takes over the boy's room in an odd rooming house. When he is given the photo of the boy's girlfriend (Geraldine Chaplin), he is so taken with it that he puts off his quest. The Organization requires him to continue, however, so he tracks her down to a remote fishing village. The two fall in love and attempt to escape.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sTJ3wYELTaCpCyO8OacJXQTJYdF.jpg", "actors": ["Geraldine Chaplin ()", "Tony Isbert (Daniel M\u00e1rquez)", "Viveca Lindfors (Se\u00f1orita Elvira)", "Jos\u00e9 Orjas (Anciano)", "Patty Shepard (Chica del Boheme)", "Julio Pe\u00f1a (Decano del coro)", "Luis Ciges (Due\u00f1o de la fonda)", "Mar\u00eda Arias (Due\u00f1a de la pensi\u00f3n)", "Eusebio Poncela (\u00d3scar Fuentes)", "Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez (Hermano de Daniel)", "Margarita Robles (Viuda de Ar\u00e9valo)", "Charly Bravo (Camarero)", "Jos\u00e9 Franco (Marmolista)", "William Layton (L\u00edder de la casa)", "Mar\u00eda S\u00e1nchez Aroca (Se\u00f1ora cementerio)", "Valent\u00edn Tornos (Eugenio Alonso)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
