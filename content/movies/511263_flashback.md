Sastry, with his ever-surprising style, turns this \u2018history of\u2019 film into a joyous mix, bringing archival film footage, documentation of Films Division\u2019s infrastructure, and the musings of John Grierson, Ezra Mir, S Sukhdev and himself together,  to tussle with the role of documentary cinema.
