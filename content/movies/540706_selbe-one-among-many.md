Shot in Senegal, Selbe focuses on the social role and economic responsibility of women in African society. Because men often leave their communities to earn money in the city, women are left with sole responsibility for their families. Through the character of Selbe we observe how one woman's personal struggle reflects the broader issues faced by many women in developing countries.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kRUzevAOPPpUlNLYMltuBmVB7st.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
