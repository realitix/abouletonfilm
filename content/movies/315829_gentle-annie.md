When the train is robbed, everyone thinks that Cotton and Violet were the ones that did the job, but no one has any proof. US Marshal Lloyd Richland comes into town in disguise to find the truth and he finds that the sheriff is corrupt and that the Goss family is gosh darn nice. They take in Richland and a stranded woman named Mary without any questions. Cotton believes that Sheriff Tatum shot their pa in the back, and the sheriff is now trying to plug the boys. Richland is looking for the train robbers, and at the same time is keeping an eye on Tatum and the lovely young Mary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qYjGLYmiu8tDveecnHQlbGuqk9y.jpg", "actors": ["James Craig (Lloyd Richland aka Rich Williams)", "Donna Reed (Mary Lingen)", "Harry Morgan (Cottonwood Goss)", "Marjorie Main (Annie Goss)", "Paul Langton (Violet Goss)", "Barton MacLane (Sheriff Tatum)", "John Philliber (Barrow)", "Morris Ankrum (Deputy Gansby)", "Noah Beery (Hansen)", "Frank Darien (Jake)", "Robert Emmett O'Connor (Childers the Bartender)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "wNdwiJz4fSQ"}
