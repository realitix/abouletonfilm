With nothing more than a fixed camera, a bit of cardboard and a lot of duct tape, he creates rooms and objects out of nothing. In a surprising and amusing way he thus reminds us of the possibilities in the most basic filmic and artistic means.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
