Manipulation and creating illusions is their profession. For them, the visual aspect of theater making is of great importance. These theater makers all have a special relationship with fine arts, they often use theater as a complement to express themselves. This form of theater has a great variety: from traditional to contemporary visual art events and everything in between. However, the starting point is always the same: bringing objects to life. By following theater makers with the camera - before, during and after the performance - we get to see things that otherwise we would never get to see: improvisations, dilemmas, the carpentry and construction. The film confronts the audience with the ingenuity of the performers and explores the genre through observation and dialogue.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/muKJjColajhUuAAu7STKx2di75k.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
