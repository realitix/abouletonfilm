Grande Otelo, the bungling \"king of the deck\", and Marta Anderson, the blond and provocative star of the show, recite in the historical scenario of the chanchadas, the abandoned studios of Cin\u00e9dia. \"The photography is splendid, it is a sort of parallel song, of critique, of parody, of understanding of a certain light typical of Brazilian cinema of the times, already re-created, already stylized. And with the older actors, Otelo, Lewgoy and the others, something very important happened in the artistic perception, seeing again, doing again, it was already a concrete metalanguage\" (J. Bressane).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9SibbIjvdJfMqA1oTHeUzifQSpk.jpg", "actors": ["Grande Otelo (Rei do Baralho)", "Marta Anderson (Loira)", "Wilson Grey (Gambler)", "Fininho (Gambler)", "Cahu\u00ea Filho (Gambler)", "Elisa (Segunda Loira)", "Guar\u00e1 Rodrigues ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
