The music in Night and Day by Gianni Castaglioni is in the repetitive rhythm of the images, usually very rapid (with some suddenly slowed down, figements, yet with a fiery intensity). And as each shot, (brief like those of Mekas or Brakhage), moves,; as the camera moves to the nervous rhythm of a wrist, the music becomes a sort of Free Jazz \u2014 and not only visually, since the soundtrack is composed of piano frenzies \u00e0 la Elton John. The extreme close-ups that sprinkle this sort of intimate journal and which are among the most admirable - as well as the most rapid - ever made in cinema, don\u2019t float adrift like the film\u2019s music through a hundred flowing veins.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rX5vkOX3nBGog0u403ApYq5aLCX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
