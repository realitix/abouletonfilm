There was only one who wasn\u2019t invited to the celebration \u2013 the frog. In his rage about the injustice, he committed suicide.\u201d Something Romani and frogs have in common is that they will never be unseen, or stay unnoticed. In her film, young director Leonor Teles weaves the life circumstance of Romani in Portugal today with the recollections of a yesterday. Anything but a passive observer, Teles consciously decides to participate and take up position. As a third pillar, she establishes an active applied performance art that becomes integrated in the cinematic narrative. Thereby transforming \u201conce upon a time\u201d into \u201cthere is\u201d. \u201cAfterwards, nothing will be as it was and the melody of life will have changed\u201d, explains a voice off-camera.
