He is sick of life and doesn\u2019t care about his parents (just as Ren\u00e9\u2019s parents never cared about him when he was a child); he doesn\u2019t even know how many more children they had. After the general amnesty, Ren\u00e9 just hangs around, not satisfied in any job, and with his younger brother he starts stealing. In no time he is back in prison, this time joined by his brother who is still a youth. History repeats itself and Ren\u00e9\u2019s life philosophy seems to be confirmed: You enjoy your freedom for a while, then go to prison and the same thing happens all over again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lRRzGPAqeiMnD62SV2FqvsNcoRD.jpg", "actors": ["Ren\u00e9 (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
