Prior to his Sexie tour in 2003 and under extreme pressure to write, he delved into his own life for inspiration. So began an accidental voyage into his past that paralleled his world tour and culminated in a moment of revelation about the source of his relentless drive. Film contains exclusive never-before-seen footage including the famous 'wolves' material, his first student sketches and unicycle-riding as a street performer in Covent Garden. Hilarious and moving by turns, an inspiring tale of how tragedy can be turned to laughter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/50SOhEtIyKqq3ZatcGELPDNKIdF.jpg", "actors": ["Eddie Izzard (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [30172, 49925, 29046, 13592], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
