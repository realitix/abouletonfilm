Rebels, led by Diego De Costa, the trusted \"Minister of the Marines and the Customs\" and Lieutenant Enricquo, the gunnery officer of the small republic's one battleship, have taken over the battleship, and the town. Most of the British citizens have taken refuge at the Consulate or have been evacuated to the small cruiser in Bianco's port, the \"H. M. S. Audacious.\" But there are two major issues; the Consul's daughter, Pamela, and Canadian Lieutenant Bill Armstrong have been kidnapped by the rebels and now held hostage on the battleship \"El Mirante,\" and El Presidente was visiting the consulate when the war broke out and is now under the protective custody of the British Empire.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Robert Douglas (Capt.
