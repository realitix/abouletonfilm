Sixty years later, six college students armed with cameras and recording equipment venture into the asylum to prove the existence of the paranormal. Thrills turn into nightmares as members of the group go missing without a sound, cell phones mysteriously vanish, corridors turn into mazes, walls appear where doors once stood, flashlights fail and something or someone begins toying with the group. Days later, when five of the six friends turn up missing, the lone survivor must go through the recovered footage in order to clear his name and find out what happened to his friends", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p9dCLAcUFBlUZ6UBKyHDJW1iQEG.jpg", "actors": ["Amanda Barton (Rebecca)", "Thomas Downey (Agent Watts)", "Katrina Kemp (Female Mental Patient)", "Oliver Rayon (John)", "Ashley Seivwright (kayden)", "Nadia Underwood (Blake)", "Derrick Scott (Daniel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [370664, 280552, 133535, 16445], "youtube_key": "f7cne5taluU"}
