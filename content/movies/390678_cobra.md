Film does have twist conclusion and some good kung fu action but also funky discotheque muzak (elevator versions of 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' and 'C.H.I.P.S.' Theme!!!) and a trite 'Death Wish' plot.  Dashes of Lee's 'Chinese Connection' & 'Fists Of Fury' with the classic style of the first ten minutes are the best thing about this bland actioner.
