Their popularity in Japan lasted from 1976 to 1979 before their attempt to break into the American market with the ill-fated TV show, \"Pink Lady and Jeff\" (1980), which wound up setting back the cause of J-pop in America by nearly 30 years. Pink Lady they gained a certain amount of attention from the sexy disco-inspired outfits they wore in concert, generally featuring shiny scanty tops, tight hot pants and gold or silver boots, seen to good advantage in some segments of the movie. This musical features the Pink Ladies as circus performers who show kindness toward a captured \"monster,\" a sad, furry being (played by a man in a bulky, over-sized pink acrylic costume) who suffers acts of unusual cruelty by the keeper and ringmaster before the girls escape with the creature in a circus trailer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rCn6yStSfkjvv9gGvIkY9yRFufA.jpg", "actors": ["Keiko Masuda (Kei)", "Mie (Mie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
