The girl in his reverie is stunningly beautiful, a blithe spirit who taunts him with her smile, her shapely figure, her sensual persona - all that a man would want as a companion for life. The real world, however, offers him someone entirely different. Anna is sweet, attentive, down to earth - all that a man could wish for in a normal marriage. The right decision, it appears, is made. And then it happens: Yannis's dream comes true - on his wedding day.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u8Ih9ptnOLXdAVlkybR9246JgYR.jpg", "actors": ["Lazaros Andreou (Yanni)", "Vivi Koka (Anna)", "Kristieanne Travers (Roxanne)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
