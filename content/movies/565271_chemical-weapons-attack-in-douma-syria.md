At that time, the city and its surrounding areas had been under siege by the Syrian military since 2013. At least 70 people died in the attacks, according to reports. Two distinctive yellow canisters, similar to those previously linked to chlorine gas attacks across Syria, were found following the strikes. Days later, following the negotiated surrender of the remaining rebel forces in Douma, Russian media were the first to be allowed access to the attack sites. Reporters from RT and TV Zvezda quickly claimed that the attacks had been staged. Commissioned by and working closely with the New York Times, Forensic Architecture searched for physical evidence concerning how the canisters had arrived at each scene, providing analysis that supports the assessment that the canisters were dropped from the air.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4aTtyq2LbsXbrknSR9JGIQIDe6j.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
