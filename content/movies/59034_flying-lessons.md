While the ruse works wonderfully on the parents of both students, the impromptu journey of self-discovery takes an unexpected detour when \"Curry\" locates his sister and becomes captivated by the country he first despised, and \"Chicken\" falls for an older medic working for Doctors Without Borders after entering a synagogue for the first time in his life. ~ Jason Buchanan,", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ef57npKq6ZG9YUmeaSx2T5hlLEU.jpg", "actors": ["Giovanna Mezzogiorno (Chiara)", "Andrea Miglio Risi (Pollo)", "Tom Angel Kharumaty (Curry)", "Flavio Bucci (Padre di Pollo)", "Anna Galiena (Madre di Pollo)", "Angela Finocchiaro (Madre di Curry)", "Roberto Citran (Padre di Curry)", "Archie Panjabi (Sharmila)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [161973, 57015, 48933, 139504], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
