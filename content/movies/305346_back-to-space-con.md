It was called \"The Red Hour Festival.\" A huge success with the fans of the original TV series (1966-69), the smash event led to much larger conventions in San Francisco, Oakland and Los Angeles. These \"Space-Con\" conventions left an indelible mark on the science-fiction fans and \"Trekkers\" who attended. In the end, conventions like Space-Con helped awaken Paramount from hibernation and led to the creation of the first installment of the major motion picture series \"Star Trek\" in 1979. This full-length documentary film is the story of how fandom revolutionized an industry.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nkok23Sbvk9df9Yx4stZ1d7pNg3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
