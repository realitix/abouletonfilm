Not surprisingly, Chuck has made more than a few enemies, from outraged viewers trying to ban his show, to families of losing contestants looking for revenge. A hitman hired by one such family has shown up at Chuck's office, and he'll need to enlist the help of his most outspoken critic to keep from ending up like most of his contestants.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p7944iQqgowLOGKAVgEtnSiHoOH.jpg", "actors": ["John McCafferty (Chuck Toedan)", "Robyn Blythe (Gloria Sternvirgin)", "Beano (Luigi Pappalardo)", "Darwyn Carson (Trudy)", "Mark Lasky (Mama Pappalardo / Spumoni)", "Bill Whitehead (Don Stuart)", "Kent Butler (Stage Manager)", "Debra Lamb (Shanna Shallow)", "Paul Farbman (Dinko)", "David Martinson (Page)", "Felicia Cavazos (Page)", "David Robinson (Guard)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [67392, 218650, 68964, 32100], "youtube_key": "ajLKE8BEoz0"}
