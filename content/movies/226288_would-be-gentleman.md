The title is meant as an oxymoron: in Moli\u00e8re's France, a \"gentleman\" was by definition nobly born, and thus there could be no such thing as a bourgeois gentleman.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nGahZ5LqL2gtAvpbKtwuw6irMZy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
