All this is a roundabout way of saying that Rockpile wasn't hurting for material: they drew heavily upon Edmunds' solo records in particular -- 13 of the songs on this 17-song setlist appeared on one of Dave's LPs -- interspersing a few rock & roll oldies along with songs from Nick, plus a showcase for Billy Bremner", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y3EyP8HfnXFk8vKYWvdLEDJOmeA.jpg", "actors": ["Nick Lowe (Performer)", "Dave Edmunds (Performer)", "Billy Bremner (Performer)", "Terry Williams (Performer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
