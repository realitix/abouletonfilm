Charismatic and sexy, Rhodes acting and singing are magnificent. His misused servant, Leporello, is played by Conal Coad, who skilfully promotes the opera's comic elements whilst delivering a thumping bass full of drama.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cM991zmZPhiJnx6DSYmMZpC4prw.jpg", "actors": ["Teddy Tahu Rhodes ()", "Conal Coad ()", "Rachelle Durkin ()", "Daniel Sumegi ()", "Henry Choo ()", "Jacqueline Dark ()", "Taryn Fiebig ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
