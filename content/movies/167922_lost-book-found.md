The piece revolves around a mysterious notebook filled with obsessive listings of places, objects, and incidents. These listings serve as the key to a hidden city: a city of unconsidered geographies and layered artifacts\u2014the relics of low-level capitalism and the debris of countless forgotten narratives. The project stems from the filmmaker's first job in New York\u2014working as a pushcart vendor on Canal Street. As usual, Cohen shot in hundreds of locations using unobtrusive equipment and generally without any crew. Influenced by the work of Walter Benjamin.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wSeBDQJiwhpi5ZDv9CZ5tn1jMDe.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
