Five parallel coming-of-age stories dramatize the stages of grief. A youthful mother in a custody battle over her children, finds tranquility with the bottle. The abuse of her ex-husband still haunts the children; a nineteen year old drug addict, and his younger brother, a bullied closet homosexual.There's the story of the dog; a teen who offers sexual favors to gain acceptance, the challenged classmate who would do anything for her love, and the redhead beauty, haunted by a secret, tragic past. These lives and others will change forever on this final evening before their hangout, The Toy Soldiers Roller Rink, closes its doors for the final time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nUkv1Fvf1Q8iDbu2GpDcV3TjIQW.jpg", "actors": ["Najarra Townsend (Angel)", "Constance Brenneman (Mary Harris)", "Chandler Rylko (Elliot Harris)", "Jeanette May Steiner (Layla)", "Samuel Nolan (Jack Harris)", "Nick Frangione (Steve)", "Amelia Haberman (Sue Harris)", "Matt Harrelson (The Stud)", "Megan Hensley (Cricket)", "Andre Darnell Myers (Wilson)", "Kevin Pinassi (Clyde Harris)", "Izzy Pollak (Harold Beaver)", "Thatcher Robinson (Jason)", "Marco Tazioli (Freddie)", "Danno White (Sean)", "William C.
