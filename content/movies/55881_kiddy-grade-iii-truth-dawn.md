Unsurprisingly, crime has grown alongside technology, and thus the GOTT, Galactic Organization of Trade and Tariffs, is formed as a sort of universal police force. Within this organization, there is a special (and secret) branch known as the ES Force (ES standing for \"Encounter of Shadow-work\"), consisting of twelve young people that possess amazing superpowers. Each ES member operates with another as a team, and the series' focus is a team of two low-level members, \u00c9clair and Lumi\u00e8re. As the series progresses, they start to see the darker side of GOTT and its secrets.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bL7LKjnaAc83itZU5tRumDlvW9l.jpg", "actors": ["Aya Hirano (Lumi\u00e8re)", "Ryouko Nagata (\u00c9clair)", "Ai Tokunaga (Viola)", "Akira Ishida (Un-oh)", "Gou Aoba (Armbrust)", "Hirotaka Suzuoki (Dextera)", "\u6728\u6751\u90c1\u7ed8 (Liquide \"Liquiy\" Cole)", "Jun Fukuyama (Tweedledum)", "Kaori Mizuhashi (Mercredi)", "Kikuko Inoue (Alv)", "Mami Kosuge (Bonita Gerard)", "Mika Doi (Eclipse)", "Natsuko Kuwatani (Tweedledee)", "Norio Wakamoto (Chevalier d'Autriche)", "Omi Minami (Dvergr)", "Tetsu Inada (A-ou)", "Toshiyuki Morikawa (Cesario)", "Akemi Kanda (Twinkle)", "Mayumi Asano (Lightning)", "Nobuo Tobita (Sinistra)", "Sumi Shimamoto (Padushka)", "Tomohisa Asou (Buchholz)", "Y\u014dsuke Akimoto (Deuxiem)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
