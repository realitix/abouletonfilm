As in his other films (Very Nice, Very Nice; 21-87), Fluxes has a disconnected flow of images that, in their erratic way, build up into a cutting indictment of the world the way it is. The film's only commentary consists of unrelated snatches of words and sounds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qHa8zBip58p2kgScTMceoX0Aopd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
