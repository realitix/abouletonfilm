The main goal of shooting the movie was to show what the german mountainbike community is up to these days.  We managed to get (nearly) every german rider involved and the team killed it on every shooting day.  \"All In One\" premiered at the \"Riff\" in Bochum on 24.06.2014. After various screenings all over Germany it\u00b4s time for the web release.
