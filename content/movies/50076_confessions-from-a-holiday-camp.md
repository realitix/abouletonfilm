The staff are lazy and inefficient, preferring to laze by the pool rather than organise activities for the holiday campers. A new owner, Mr. Whitemonk, an ex-prison officer, takes over the camp and is determined to install discipline into the staff. He is on the verge of dismissing Timmy and Sidney; however, Sidney's suggestion of organising a beauty contest changes his mind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vY4NeFiyyyV9tX48YVSQuk34MPI.jpg", "actors": ["Robin Askwith (Timmy Lea)", "Tony Booth (Sidney Noggett)", "Liz Fraser (Mrs. Antonia Whitemonk)", "Lance Percival (Lionel)", "Bill Maynard (Mr. Lea)", "Linda Hayden (Brigitte)", "Sheila White (Rosie Noggett)", "Doris Hare (Mrs. Lea)", "Miriam Margolyes (Blackbird)", "Caroline Ellis (Glad)", "Marianne Stone (Waitress)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [33301, 34905, 68656, 33303], "youtube_key": "_c9KptXNN-s"}
