With one more sighting - the elusive sociable plover - he will have 'twitched' the entire British List. Tunt has his shortwave radio, packed-lunch and a portrait of his ex-wife Sandra for company. Suddenly, in the midst of a conversation with Sandra's portrait, the hide door blows open and a bedraggled stranger - unshaven, edgy and bloodied introduces himself as Dave John, a fugitive from the storm. After a tense introduction, the two men discover that they have a good deal in common, sharing sandwiches, tea and personal exchanges which are frank, poignant and often funny. As the two men begin to form a close bond news of a police manhunt sets them both on edge driving their fragile relationship to a tragic conclusion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5r1HMf6e221VcbYMJhXUMKNQKR7.jpg", "actors": ["Alex MacQueen (Roy Tunt)", "Phil Campbell (Dave John)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [130677, 17173, 182484], "youtube_key": "_SdsXVyDT6w"}
