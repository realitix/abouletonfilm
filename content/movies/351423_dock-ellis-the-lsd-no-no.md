Using their original radio documentary as the audio and inspiration, Isenberg commissioned an original animation from James Blagden whose incredible black and white illustrations, lo-fi animation and comic timing perfectly complemented Ellis\u2019s masterful storytelling.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qSluYHPfwl6DoRsFQmKHJ81hBR4.jpg", "actors": ["Dock P.
