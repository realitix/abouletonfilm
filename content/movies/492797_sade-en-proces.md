Sade was born in 1755 and already in 1778 he was sentenced to a years-long prison, which was renewed by himself because of the writing of \"scandalous\" texts. This saved his life after the French revolution, but he soon came into conflict with Robespierre.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Andr\u00e9 Wilms ()", "Evelyne Didi (Marie-Constance Quesnet)", "Anne De Broca (Delphine de Girardin)", "Bernard Verley ()", "Fran\u00e7ois Chattot ()", "Judith Henry ()", "Alexia Str\u00e9si ()", "Maud Rayer ()", "Gilles Arbona ()", "Lemmy Constantine ()", "Andr\u00e9 Dussollier (Le Marquis de Sade (voice))", "Jean Dautremay ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
