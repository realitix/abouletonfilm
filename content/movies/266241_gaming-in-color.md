The GaymerX convention that took place in 2013 was a huge step forward for the queer geek community being recognized on a worldwide industry scale. In the same year, more popular mainstream and indie games featured a greater amount of gay and lesbian characters than ever before, helping with visibility and acceptance. The video games universe will only continue to improve and diversify both in its community and industry if we elevate the conversation about inclusion and respecting one another - not in spite of our gay geekiness, but because of it!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i59I888XIWTbSlkHh1fVkdmsiUz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [290858, 180886, 62128, 28867], "youtube_key": "BGmnWC1yCvQ"}
