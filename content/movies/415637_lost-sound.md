The work explores the potential of chance, creating portraits of particular places by building formal, narrative and musical connections between images and sounds linked by the random discovery of the tape samples.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lm1yQSxwqTkxAGI4TBOiAnyVE5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
