Although they work long hours as maids or street vendors and share a tiny room no bigger than a closet, they savor these years\u2014 between living as a daughter at home and returning to the village to marry \u2014as probably the freest time of their lives. Documenting both her deepening relationship with these women and the gulf of experiences and opportunity that separate them, Hong carefully charts their hopes for a better future and dreams of self-determination.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bkakgcvL5cKnxODSpXYumVv97yS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
