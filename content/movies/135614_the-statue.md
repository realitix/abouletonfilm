An ambitious diplomat, capitalizing on Bolt's celebrity, arranges for the U.S. to commission a statue for a London square to honor Bolt's achievement. Bolt's Italian wife, a renowned artist, sculpts an 18-foot nude of Bolt. In a pique, because he's neglected her for years to do his work, she gives the statue a spectacular phallus, telling Bolt that he wasn't its model. Thinking he's a cuckold, Bolt goes on a jealous search for a man matching the statue. The diplomat, too, wants changes in the statue to protect his conservative image. Can art and love reconcile?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/un9O0ewjQZ3iOAIxIbhbTV85ya2.jpg", "actors": ["David Niven (Alex Bolt)", "Virna Lisi (Rhonda Bolt)", "Robert Vaughn (Ray Whiteley)", "Ann Bell (Pat Demarest)", "John Cleese (Harry)", "Tim Brooke-Taylor (Hillcrest)", "Hugh Burden (Sir Geoffrey)", "Erik Chitty (Mouser)", "Derek Francis (Sanders)", "Susan Travers (Mrs. Southwick)", "Desmond Walter-Ellis (Mr. Southwick)", "David Allister (Mr. Westbury)", "Maureen Lane (Mrs. Westbury)", "Zoe Sallis (Mrs. Euston)", "Graham Chapman (News reader)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [148948, 104360], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
