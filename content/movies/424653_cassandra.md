These unsolved questions pursue Cassandra during her trip through the impenetrable Chaco as chronicler of a means of communication, her first job after graduating from literature school. The unknown reality of native peoples who live in the Chaco communities, their beautiful and uncomprehensive languages and their dilemmas facing an economy which excludes them, are part of a trip in which Cassandra finds an inhabitable world within her status as foreigner. Her visions start merging with the cosmovision of ancient inhabitants until she becomes part of the enigma herself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sHztiMWb33jkiKiFgnT3B6Q577F.jpg", "actors": ["Edgardo Cozarinsky ()", "Agustina Mu\u00f1oz ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
