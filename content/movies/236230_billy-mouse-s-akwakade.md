The soap bubbles float downstairs to where the dog and cat are sleeping, who blame each other for the disturbance, and have a fight about it. When they learn the mice are the bubble producers, they go after them with a vacuum cleaner.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wodXkk5IoHbwtzXEG9LvwCKhBpt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
