His father had hung a painting of Jesus above his bed. Every evening before closing his eyes, he would beg the man on the cross to look after his family. When his family collapsed and his father left their home, in spite of all his prayers, young Jon blinded his father's gift, burning Jesus' eyes with a glowing poker. Since then the director has travelled the world with his camera to find ways of making up for the damage. His film tells of this journey, mirroring his own life's story in images and clips from his more than forty films made in a variety of genres.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jHueMdfXnokKXvNfKZ7IuSUXhzL.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
