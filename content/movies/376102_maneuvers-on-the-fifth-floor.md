Every morning when they come to work they lock the door of the office and, armed with binoculars and great interest, they begin watching the aerobics exercises of a young girl in the nearby building. Suddenly, their tranquil daily round is disturbed - a new director takes over the Institute and decides to develop close scientific partnerships with similar institutes in Japan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s1slbGrjPy8BamFomj9VV02qrrJ.jpg", "actors": ["Velko Kanev (Petar Petkin)", "Stefan Danailov (Danton Tahov)", "Anton Radichev (Andrey Granitski)", "Iskra Radeva (Tahova)", "Ivan Grigorov (Sotirov)", "Maria Stefanova (Michona)", "Ventsislav Valchev (Rusev)", "Maria Statulova (Petkin's wife)", "Vasil Stoychev (Kostadinov)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
