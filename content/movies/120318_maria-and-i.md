Sometimes Miguel and Mar\u00eda go on holiday together, spending a week at a resort in southern Gran Canaria, a rather unusual setting where the guests don't normally include a single father and his fourteen year-old autistic daughter. This is the story of one of their journeys, but above all it's an original tale, full of humor, irony and sincerity, about how to live with a disability.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/48rgQbiq0Awbxl10EV4XQZGEiq5.jpg", "actors": ["Miguel Gallardo ()", "Mar\u00eda Gallardo ()", "May Su\u00e1rez ()", "Pepe Su\u00e1rez ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "aviGMwGRsr0"}
