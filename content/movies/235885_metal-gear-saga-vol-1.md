Spanning five games and just as many decades of fictional history, Metal Gear Saga ties together the game's complex narrative in chronological order, from the 1960's-with the heroic origins of Big Boss in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater-to the cliffhanger conclusion of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, set in the early 21st century. Metal Gear series creator Hideo Kojima also appears in a series of candid interviews, recounting the origins of the series and sharing its secrets, such as the original setting of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, his thoughts on the infamous NES game Snake's Revenge, and what gamers can look forward to in the forthcoming Metal Gear Solid 4.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uKj8DQAhVYQFeJVK12Ud6vmnPb9.jpg", "actors": ["Hideo Kojima (Himself)", "David Hayter (Solid Snake)", "Christopher Randolph (Hal \"Otacon\" Emmerich)", "Paul Eiding (Col.
