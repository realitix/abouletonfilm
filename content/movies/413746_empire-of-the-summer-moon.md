In 1836, Cynthia Ann Parker, a lovely nine-year-old girl with cornflower-blue eyes, gets kidnapped by Comanches from the far Texas frontier. She then grows to love her captors and becomes infamous as the \"White Squaw\", a pioneer woman who refused to return until her tragic capture by Texas Rangers in 1860. Her mixed-blood son, Quanah, succeeds her and becomes the last and greatest chief of the Comanches. Their legacy is wrapped around the rise, and ultimately, the fall of the most powerful Indian tribe in American history, battling a war spanning four decades, holding up the development of the new American nation. In a beautiful tale encompassing Spanish colonialism, the Civil War, the destruction of the buffalo herds, and the arrival of the railroads, is the war of the Comanches.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
