{"tmdb_id": 307302, "title": "Dixie Ray Hollywood Star", "original_title": "Dixie Ray Hollywood Star", "slug_title": "dixie-ray-hollywood-star", "date": "1983-01-01", "genre": [""], "score": "4.0/10", "synopsis": "Lisa De Leeuw is Dixie Ray, a beautiful but bad starlet who finds herself the target of a vicious blackmailer - and in desperate need of Nick's services in more ways than one. If Nick can stop the extortionist, he'll receive his usual fee, plus the carnal pleasures that only a Hollywood star can provide.  The flick is masterfully shot in a facsimile of the film noir style -- all moody shadows and lurid angles. All of the atmosphere adds an extra layer of sizzle to what's already a great sex film. 'Dixie Ray Hollywood Star' in many ways represents the ultimate Golden Age expression of the porn P.I. flick -- crafty plot, luscious women and plenty of sweaty sensuality.  Award Winner for \"Best Film\" at the 1984 Adult Film Association of America Awards. Winner of 4 AVN Awards in 1985 for \"Best Director\", \"Best Art Direction\", \"Best Screenplay\" and \"Best Supporting Actress (Lisa DeLeeuw).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/deQ0kJYJlvWLJ1gxYkivBTvfnKb.jpg", "actors": ["Lisa De Leeuw (Dixie Ray)", "John Leslie (Nick Popodopolis)", "Juliet Anderson (Adrian)", "Veronica Hart (Sherry)", "Kelly Nichols (Leslie)", "Samantha Fox (Lisa)", "Cameron Mitchell (The Lieutenant)", "John F.
