Oscar and Jose, two friends and former classmates, tell about the tragic ghost apparitions and their constant bickering with an albino boy. A friend from the same classroom could only see the ghost, because in Equatorial Guinea they say that albinos have four eyes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ov3aeTBq0tkDI3MMO9OqHYD9Qum.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
