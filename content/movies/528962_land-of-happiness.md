Gladly welcomed by her family, he stares fixedly at the prepared memorial table in the living room. The table was for her son, Jin-woo, who died 8 years ago saving Min-soo's life when he tried to kill himself. Hui-ja greets Min-soo with warmth thinking about her dead son, but he regards everything as a discomfort and a pain.
