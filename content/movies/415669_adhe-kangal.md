The icing on the cake is she brilliantly & ruthlessly performed it. She deserves compliments, accolades & credits for it. Sshivada already proved her acting talent in \"Nedunchaalai\" & \"Zero\", thus this is easily another feather in her cap. As audience, we hardly come across Tamil actress who carried significant role on their shoulders. Sshivada has all the potential to grab the special place as a good actress soon if she consistently acting in this type of vital roles.\r\n\r\n\"Thandhiraa\" song need special mention here, S.N. Anuradha's lyrics beautifully summarize the Vasundara character.\r\n\r\nLyrics excerpts:\r\n\"Adiye nee kalavaani kutti kaattaeri\r\nkannaadi dhegathil kaattaaru nee\r\n\r\nAmul baby makeup-il Anakonda nee\r\n\r\nAzhagaana sadhigaari adangaa pidaari\r\nSidharaamal pandhaadum siru marmam nee\r\n\r\nBarbie doll getup-il pachchondhi nee\r\n\r\nAzhagaana abaththae ival thaane vilagu\"\r\n\r\nAbishek Joseph George - I like his body language, expressions, performance as a blind man. It's totally apt, good & brilliant.\r\n\r\nSshivada & Abishek Joseph George easily stole the limelight with their performances. Outshines better than the two lead roles (Kalaiyarasan & Janani Iyer).\r\n\r\nBala Saravanan's entry initially makes me feel like this film lost it's track since comical episodes seems appear nowhere in a serious subject. I need to admit that the comical portions was relief and it's not spoil the core subject of this film & it's good too.\r\n\r\nIf you like C. V. Kumar's productions (Thirukumaran Entertainment) or looking for a different taste of thriller then update your watchlist & do watch.\r\n\r\nI believe this film worth your time & money...!\r\n\r\nAt least watch it for the hero of the film Sshivada. Wait hmmm I said hero..? Yes it is, she is hero of this subject.\r\n\r\nDo watch it since we hardly come across female oriented subjects, last was \"Irudhi Suttru & now maybe \"Adhe Kangal\".\r\n\r\nCheckout full review on link below:\r\n\r\nhttps://letterboxd.com/stevenrajz/film/adhey-kangal/"}], "recommandations_id": [363178, 504231, 415193, 414523], "youtube_key": "uav82NHzGRM"}
