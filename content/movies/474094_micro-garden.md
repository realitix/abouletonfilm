A flush of watery blues (in this hand-painted step-printed film) brightens the plant-skein into a veriety (sic) of greens mixed into all other colors-all darkening into smeared mud-blacks with microscopic beseeming black \"splatters\" (where mud-like cracks used to be.) The turquoise blues, red and tans resolve into a flare of red at end.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1JtaxwLmK1J0LAZBRt2EZnX1raR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
