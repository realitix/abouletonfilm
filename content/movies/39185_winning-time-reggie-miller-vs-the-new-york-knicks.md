But it was the 1995 Eastern Conference Semifinals that solidified Miller as Public Enemy #1 in New York City. With moments to go in Game 1, and facing a seemingly insurmountable deficit of 105-99, Miller scored eight points in 8.9 seconds to give his Indiana Pacers an astonishing victory. This career-defining performance, combined with his give-and-take with Knicks fan Spike Lee, made Miller and the Knicks a highlight of the 1995 NBA playoffs. Peabody Award-winning director Dan Klores will explore how Miller proudly built his legend as \"The Garden's Greatest Villain\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bkoVQECftQMCKjGfQCSyoASZpOW.jpg", "actors": ["Reggie Miller (Himself)", "Cheryl Miller (Herself)", "Spike Lee (Himself)", "Patrick Ewing (Himself)", "Donnie Walsh (Himself)", "Marv Albert (Himself)", "Greg Anthony (Himself)", "Bill Benner (Himself)", "Ira Berkow (Himself)", "Mark Boyle (Himself)", "Larry Brown (Himself)", "Mel Daniels (Himself)", "Antonio Davis (Himself)", "Mike Francesa (Himself)", "Ernie Grunfeld (Himself)", "Mark Jackson (Himself)", "Anthony Mason (Himself)", "Ahmad Rashad (Himself)", "Pat Riley (Himself)", "Byron Scott (Himself)", "Rik Smits (Himself)", "Charles Smith (Himself)", "Jeff Van Gundy (Himself)", "Peter Vecsey (Himself)", "Herb Williams (Himself)", "John Starks (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [54694, 54684, 54734, 54747], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
