The Old Man lands near a Caribbean island where a poor family gives him shelter in a chicken coop. Father Gonzaga is the skeptical priest who rushes to damn the creature. Soon the Old Man is the subject of curiosity seekers as Elisinda and Pelayo start charging admission. A traveling carnival of human oddities camps near the Old Man as people flock to see the show. The Old Man is reduced to being an unwanted pet, and after six years, he mends his wings and flies away. Nudity, simulated sex with a spider woman, and the ugliness of human exploitation definitely put this fantasy in a category not for children.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/saAL7yJEB8CANGs4xLs4kT8aQP.jpg", "actors": ["Daisy Granados ()", "Fernando Birri ()", "Adolfo Llaurad\u00f3 ()", "Asdr\u00fabal Mel\u00e9ndez ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
