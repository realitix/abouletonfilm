But even as detective Jack Spade encounters ancient French Quarter jewelers, shifty bayou drunks, rich uptown socialites, mysterious street prostitutes, exotic voodoo fortune tellers, corrupt police lieutenants, and homicidal Mardi Gras jesters - none of whom he can trust individually - he can't continue to ignore the mounting evidence that his father may have been involved in both crimes.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
