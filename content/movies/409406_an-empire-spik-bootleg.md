Since there was no audio, %20 added fourteen fan commentary or ESB 30th anniversary podcasts which were sync'd up at the starting point of the crawl. Since a DVD can only have eight audio tracks, each of the commentaries were mono'd and shifted to the left or right channel. Use this disc to practice your audio shifting and commentary channel switching abilities, while you get an in-depth listen to the public's continued fascination with this movie sequel.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rhfZMmRHEkNlVRjGErq1m7AfvW3.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
