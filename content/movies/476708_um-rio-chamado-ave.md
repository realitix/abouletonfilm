In the sense of change, like the natural condition of a river and of man. In low flight across the water, from the source in the mountains to its mouth, we witness the consequences of the indifference of man towards nature. But the river resists. Because everything that runs deep is revealed at the surface.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
