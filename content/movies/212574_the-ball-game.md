Our camera is stationed about twenty feet from the bag, and the satisfied grin of the runner is great as he touches first and gets up on his toes for second. Next man cracks first ball pitched for a two-bagger, and races for the base with a wonderful burst of speed. First baseman just misses a put out. Very exciting. Man on the coaching line yells, and umpire runs up and makes decision. Small boy runs past back of the catcher close to the grand stand, where there is great commotion. A most excellent subject, treated brilliantly.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zw2eDmGjLF7ELrZ5axK8eX3QqTs.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
