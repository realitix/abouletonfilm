The programme follows a specialist pathology team as they conduct a post-mortem on the body of a 17-stone woman whose body was donated to medical science. Their findings, as they dissect the body and its organs, are startling, exposing the devastating impact of obesity with stunning visuals and fascinating medical facts.  Morbid obesity reduces life expectancy by an average of nine years and is blamed for over 30,000 deaths in the UK every year. With 65 per cent of people already overweight or obese, this extraordinary film is a powerful contribution to the debate about fat, food, lifestyle and how the health service will cope with the growing obesity crisis.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ythG2RwuyJUMN4sNZ0CWQZ3N4Sq.jpg", "actors": ["Vinette Robinson (Narrator)", "Mike Osborn (Dr Mike Osborn)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [460167], "youtube_key": "LW9WmnNrfQ8"}
