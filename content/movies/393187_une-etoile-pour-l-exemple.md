Her 1972 farewell performance at the Paris Opera concluded her dancing career. Famed composer Henri Suageut tells the visiting Yvette \"I hear my music in your movements.\" Curiously, an interview with Rudolf Nureyev gives little insight or interest on the dancers or their performance art.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sOuh0buRXJRMpkMEnT45PA48uuH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
