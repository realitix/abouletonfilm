A movie. It felt like watching an episode of a TV show that I'm too young to have ever seen. \r\n\r\nSo I did some research and turns out there's a reason for that! It was originally the pilot for a 2013 Roger Moore produced throwback TV show that never got off the ground, which they attempted to re-tool into a VOD movie in 2015, but was never actually released until it could capitalise on the death of Roger Moore earlier this year. Regardless of the reasoning, this remake relegates cult-favourite Eliza Dushku to deskjockey for 99% of the movie, because that's just the kind of bad decisions _The Saint_ likes to make.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"}], "recommandations_id": [97938, 324276, 297621, 454349]}
