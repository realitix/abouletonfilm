(Bugliosi is the L.A. prosecutor that put Charles Manson away.) On December 11, 1966, a murder occurs in a small neighborhood of El Sereno, CA. In the middle of the night, Henry Stockton is shot three times in the head and twice in the chest and then his house is set on fire. The murderer left no clues, baffling the police, until a year later when a young pregnant woman is found bludgeoned to death in a Jaguar. Strangely, these two murders are related. As the mystery unfolds a horrific tale of greed, lust and ambition are revealed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/axUCMwbMGQmClaUBQi0Wn3a7S48.jpg", "actors": ["Treat Williams (Alan Palliko)", "Arliss Howard (Vincent Bugliosi)", "Rebecca Jenkins (Sandra Stockton)", "Pruitt Taylor Vince (Michael Brockington)", "Dean Norris (Matt Hobert)", "Ashley Judd (Gwen Fox)", "Richard Schiff (Jack Wells)", "J.E.
