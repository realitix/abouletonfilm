The calf is frightened by a shadow, until it's revealed to be a jackrabbit. He follows the rabbit deep into the woods, but neither of them notices the wolf following until it's too late for the calf. The calf is trapped in a niche under some rocks, which the wolf quickly digs out. The wolf is closing in on the calf when the rabbit tries to distract him, to no avail.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pzLRIVgPez0QZeiEyqxsjHWdWqS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
