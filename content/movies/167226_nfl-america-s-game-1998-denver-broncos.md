At the age of 38, quarterback John Elway was still playing like he was in his prime, and Terrell Davis was on his way to breaking the 2,000-rushing-yards barrier (the 4th in NFL history). The '98 Broncos didn't break the '72 Dolphins' monopoly on perfect NFL seasons -- they were upset by the New York Giants in Week 15 -- but they did repeat as Super Bowl Champions. Elway threw for 336 yards and won MVP honors", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yOje94FxErMdbOSdUkg2U2XM0zf.jpg", "actors": ["John Elway ()", "Terrell Davis ()", "Shannon Sharpe ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
