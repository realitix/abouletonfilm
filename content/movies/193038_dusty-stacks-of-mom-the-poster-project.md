Using alternate lyrics as voice over narration, the piece adopts the form of a popular rock album reinterpreted as a cine-performance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6xnVA7oKxQiecthYgiZ0kq4Pb56.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
