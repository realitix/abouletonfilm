This film tells the story of their difficult relationship, seen from the perspective of the younger brother, who is not afraid to dish up a good share of self-mockery. \u201cMy brother thinks that once in a lifetime, everyone should take apart an engine block,\u201d we hear him say in the voiceover. Next, we see Wout grapple with a towel and a pile of engine parts, while his older brother irritably lectures him from a distance. When Wout scales the slopes of the Himalayas with his camera, he comes to the point of making an important decision about his life.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Joost Conijn (himself)", "Wout Conijn (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
