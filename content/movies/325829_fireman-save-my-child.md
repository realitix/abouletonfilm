Mutt believes where there's smoke, there's fire, which gets them into an early scrape. But they are called to an actual fire of a several storied residential building. A frantic woman asks them to save her baby who is located on the top floor of the burning building. Their first problem is how to get up to the top floor, which Jeff inadvertently figures out how to do. But other distractions plus trying to find the baby through the thick smoke may be obstacles in achieving their mission. But something that the woman doesn't tell them may be the biggest hurdle.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
