She read his every book, so when she hears of the opportunity of delivering a gift to his house she does everything in her power to become the tansporter (and succeeds). Manea is a handsome man, not only a successful writer , women of the elite of Bucharest's society swarm around him all the time.He has just broken up with one of them... It's New Year's Eve,he invites her to spend some time with him...a dream built on snowflakes and champagne. In her naivety and pureness , Dorulet-as Manea caresses her,touches the unseen strings of his heart and soul , which he taught to be long dead,she awoke adolescence (like) emotions in the sleeping lion.
