The show came on the back of the band's No.1 album Velociraptor! and the setlist combines tracks from that album with hits and classic album tracks from across their career so far. The concert was part of a sold out arena tour that covered the UK and Ireland at the end of last year. Kasabian are the recipients of numerous awards for Best Live Band and Best British Band in recent years and this new show with its spectacular and innovative staging will be a must have for their huge and dedicated fanbase.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2yE3sXWaIScTAyMTAggrBzK5g48.jpg", "actors": ["Sergio Pizzorno (Sergio Pizzorno)", "Tom Meighan (Tom Meighan)", "Tom Meighan (Chris Edwards.)", "Ian Matthews (Ian Matthews)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
