Nellie Lovett adds something extra to the meat pies she peddles on Fleet Street. The secret ingredient: freshly murdered victims of her partner in crime, barber Sweeney Todd. Composer/lyricist Stephen Sondheim refashions a macabre tale into a musical masterwork in this dazzling performance of the 1979 Broadway hit originally staged by Harold Prince. In her Tony-winning role, Angela Lansbury plays Nellie. George Hearn turns his stage role of twisted Sweeney into an Emmy-winning triumph. The score coils around itself in every-tightening spirals. The lines ripple with black humor and madness. Enter Sweeney's tonsorial parlor. Attend the tale.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/loUOqb5fyEeGqfzmUiWiN1rLYG4.jpg", "actors": ["Angela Lansbury (Nellie Lovett)", "George Hearn (Sweeney Todd)", "Edmund Lyndeck (Judge Turpin)", "Cris Groenendaal (Anthony Hope)", "Calvin Remsberg (The Beadle)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [287983, 44349, 76468, 42088], "youtube_key": "RXj-nQDmgnw"}
