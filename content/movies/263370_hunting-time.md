{"tmdb_id": 263370, "title": "Hunting Time", "original_title": "Av Zamani", "slug_title": "hunting-time", "date": "1988-01-01", "genre": [""], "score": "5.0/10", "synopsis": "During the year of the repressive military regime, a Turkish writer gets disillusioned by the loss of a dear friend and retires to his hometown on a remote island where he feels safe from the political turmoil. There he escapes to the world of memories, having imaginary conversations with his dead friend. However, the news of a new murder alerts him to the dangers lying ahead. Shot in Turkey following the years of military regime, Av Zamani carries autobiographical elements as the director Erden Kiral also had to flee the repressive regime of his country to be an exile in Germany. The weakness of the film is that the director is not able to take enough distance from the events to give the story a more universal appeal. Av Zamani was screened at the Montreal World Film Festival 1988.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iYIlT0Za8UEJJFN2otaLMpH8lLx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
