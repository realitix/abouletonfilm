His father just happens to be the officer in charge and is a senior police general. He and other cops go on a raid to catch some relatively small amphetamine dealers. During the raid the dealers shoot at the police while fleeing. They are shot dead on the spot. However he sees what appears to be a \"pregnant woman\" who runs off and Boon gives chase. When he catches up, he corners \"her\" but as \"she\" is pregnant he cannot bring himself to pull the trigger and \"she\" escapes.  He is sent undercover and told to pose as a gay while finding out if any drug dealing is going on in a nightclub where it is suspected the kingpins are based. He falls in love with a singer there who is the daughter of the boss he is supposed to be watching.  When he eventually finds out they are indeed major dealers can he do his duty or will he fail due to his new love and whose side will she be on when she finds out everything?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xPynMAmJW5oRr2Ju1gfLGXXkdIx.jpg", "actors": ["Sara Malakul Lane ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
