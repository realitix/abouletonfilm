Marilyn Sewell is successful and beloved in the pulpit, but behind the scenes she is lonely and yearning for change. As she considers leaving the ministry, she realizes she will be leaving her only social network. Yet when she falls in love for the first time, she realizes she does not trust intimacy. A study in contrasts, Marilyn must rely on raw faith as she questions her future, her difficult past, her God, and most importantly... her ability to love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u2DvoNxWex1NaGFWBYlqIEgXbDl.jpg", "actors": ["Marilyn Sewell (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
