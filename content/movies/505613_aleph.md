Superimpositions at fever pitch falling apart and compressing into new molecular lattices. Peripheral fantasies imagine forth collusioned destinies. A yin/yang interchange makes light's transparency into density, while the darkness metamorphoses into thin lucidity. Hands in peristaltic motion grasp and release, conjuring interstitial embroideries. Landscapes yield their own maps in topographical patterns.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/49Sz9rDJkxEN67aCEcepm1q7lBK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
