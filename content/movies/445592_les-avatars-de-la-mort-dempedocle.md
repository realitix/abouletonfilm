Assistant cameraman Jean-Paul Toraille toyed around, so to speak, with his first video camera, filming the daily work on the set. Now, 24 years later, he was joined by Jean-Marie Straub in editing the material into a film. Anyone who expected the shooting of Les Avatars de la mort d\u2019Emp\u00e9docle to be an austere affair, an exercise entirely devoid of humour or a Straubian tour de force is proven wrong: so much lightness, joy, concentration, spells of waiting for the sun to come out \u2013 and even proper slapstick in between \u2013 is hard to find.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jean-Marie Straub ()", "Vladimir Baratta ()", "William Berger ()", "Martina Baratta ()", "Renato Berta ()", "Louis Hochet ()", "Dani\u00e8le Huillet ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
