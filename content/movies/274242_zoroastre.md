True to the form of the tragedie lyrique, choreographer Amir Hosseinpour's dances perfectly match the weight and meaning of both plot and music. The ensemble, Les Talens Lyriques, reinforced with musicians from the Drottningholm Court Theatre Orchestra and Chorus, is expertly and passionately led into the musical stratosphere by musical director Christophe Rousset. This intensely dramatic production is captured live in vibrant High Definition video and true surround sound. -  Anders J. Dahlin, Evgueniy Alexiev, Sine Bundgaard", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pN8aHNAILUqTDwMSlPZ2Lim0zXT.jpg", "actors": ["Anders J.
