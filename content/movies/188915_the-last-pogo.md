THE LAST POGO documents the raucous 1978 punk concert held in Toronto's legendary Horseshoe Tavern-a night of unhinged music and unbridled mayhem. On December 1, 1978, legendary Toronto concert promoters Gary Topp and Gary Cormier-better known as The Garys-presented The Last Pogo, a rollicking, riotous concert at the venerable Horseshoe Tavern. On the bill were seminal bands from Toronto's punk rock scene: The Scenics, The Cardboard Brains, The Secrets, The Mods, The Ugly, The Viletones and Teenage Head. During the concert, the frenetic energy of 800+ thrashing fans in the club boiled over and a near-riot ensued. Filmmaker Colin Brunton was there with a camera crew to capture it all, from the irreverent punk musicians and the slam-dancing audience to the police who tried to stop the show and the firefighters called in to escort people from the premises.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vMuN4t4yNsJFzwD7xi1oVdRFD3B.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
