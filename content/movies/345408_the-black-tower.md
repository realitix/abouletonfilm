While the character of the central protagonist is indicated only by a narrative voice-over which takes us from unease to breakdown to mysterious death, the images, meticulously controlled and articulated, deliver a series of colour coded puzzles, jokes and puns which pull the viewer into a mind-teasing engagement.  Smith\u2019s assurance and skill as a filmmaker undercuts the notion of the avant-garde as dry, unprofessional and dull and in The Black Tower we have an example of a film which plays with the emotions as well as the language of film.\u201d Nik Houghton, Independent Media 1987", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/twbjvyNMjLNRXSThkOHu7HYzJqi.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
