Fleeting visions and voices erupt out of the ominous abstraction in unusual juxtapositions, suggesting a cinematic free-association marked by anxiety, pleasure and shame. Best appreciated in the immediate; the 7200 painted frames fly by at an average of 12 per second.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pgINQt8fQYAL6FSqFV4meag4yCt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
