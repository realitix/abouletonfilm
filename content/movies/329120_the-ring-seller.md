One day the mayor (Nasri Shamseddine) tells the villagers that Rajeh is heading to the village itself and they better be careful. Two smart men notice that the mayor was lying and that it is all his imagination. So they go on making good on the fictitious person and steal money and assault the mayor in the dark saying that they were Rajeh. Eventually, an old man with the name of Rajeh arrives in the village, amid public fears. Then it became obvious that Rajeh was merely a seller of rings for weddings and he wanted to marry his son to Fairuz the nephew of the mayor. The two bad guys willingly go to jail for making use of the mayor's joke.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/esqtTM0J8emJRjrUFBc7wSp2MIm.jpg", "actors": ["Fairuz (Rima)", "Nasri Shamseddine (El Moukhtar)", "Joseph Azar (Rajeh)", "Phelemone Wehbe (Sabeh)", "Joseph Nassif (Fadlo)", "Elie Choueiri (Eid)", "Mansour Rahbani (Makhoul)", "Salwa Haddad (Zbayda)", "William Hasswani (Al Shaweesh)", "Huda (Layla)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
