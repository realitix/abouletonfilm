The mystery proves too much for a pretty young student who decides to investigate for her senior class project. Unfortunately, she does not find ghosts. She, instead, finds Stanley... serial rapist, murderer, and psychopath. As the young girl becomes Stanley's new pet, a team of young investigators descend on the hospital to \"hunt some ghosts.\" Stanley sees nothing but fun and games in his future. But, what Stanley does not know is that the hospital truly is haunted and the restless spirits there are not happy with what he has been doing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sH9y7OTF6jAmTWnRuMyHgUy3KYr.jpg", "actors": ["Jim O'Rear (Alan)", "Daniel Emery Taylor (Stanley Creech)", "John Dugan (Officer Chapman)", "April Monique Burril (Mallory)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [133535, 273519, 119175, 254126], "youtube_key": "0jJRcnf6Czg"}
