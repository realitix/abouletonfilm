One evening, he decides to win the heart of his beloved, who until now has been cruel and deaf to his fiery declarations, and if necessary, he'll kidnap her. Hidden at the edge of the woods, when Alphonsine goes by, Sosth\u00e8ne rolls through the grass until he lands at the beauty's feet, proclaiming his love in a deranged voice: \"Be mine, or die!\", \"You idiot!\". Blood rushes to Sosth\u00e8ne's head. His breath becomes so ragged that it can be heard a mile away, catching the attention of the famous detective Zigoto who was walking Bouboule, his no less famous police dog.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hioNHokZfwTfOjP3nR6T8etcyRP.jpg", "actors": ["Lucien Bataille (Zigoto)", "Berthe Dagmar (Alphonsine, la blanchisseuse)", "\u00c9douard Grisollet ()", "Gaston Modot ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
