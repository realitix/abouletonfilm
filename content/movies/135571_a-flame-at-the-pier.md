The rebel works as an errand boy for a shipping company and vents his frustrations by plucking on the guitar. His interpretations of popular trends in music are sometimes right-on, and sometimes not exactly. Bereft of his guitar, the rebel's modes of expression are not as effective in generating interest as the Yokohama docks themselves, a fascinating world in their own right.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k61kMfMVD3OK0HAmJhdDSCfHfq.jpg", "actors": ["Takashi Fujiki (Saburo Minakami)", "Mariko Kaga (Yuki)", "Ky\u00f4ko Kishida (Reiko)", "Tamotsu Hayakawa (Kaga)", "K\u00f4ji Nanbara ()", "Yasushi Nagata ()", "Asao Koike ()", "Shinji Tanaka ()", "Shigeru K\u00f4yama ()", "Takamaru Sasaki ()", "Jun Hamamura ()", "Hisao Toake ()", "Toshio Hosokawa ()", "Koji Kiyomura ()", "S\u00f4 Yamamura ()", "Tetsur\u014d Tamba ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
