He slowly begins to realize that be may be there for a reason, but the arrogant nature of his personality is always at conflict.  As someone with long term sobriety, I always tell people that this is close to the real thing that Hollywood has to offer.  Nobody is a model citizen in this world, most are flawed, lonely, angry characters, however there is some redemption in the masses.  Strong supporting roles including M. Emmet Walsh, Kathy Bates and a young Morgan Freeman.  Worth a look if you can find it."}], "recommandations_id": [69007, 16814, 75531, 53922]}
