They start off where they always do, old rivalries in place, extreme vanity covering great insecurities, but with a true love for each other underneath the bickering, sniping and sassing. A number of drinks into night one and a dark secret is revealed. The house they rented is the site of a mass murder of teenage girls 15 years earlier. Blood still stains the floors under replacement carpets. The killer still runs free. The girls take it for what it seems - a fun story for a rainy night by a roaring fire. But after one of them disappears and is discovered dead, the story doesn't seem so fun anymore. 1 by 1, they die, killed by their own vanity. The fun-filled week turns into a race against death. Who will make it out alive?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aAG7PLyV3gqvbUPr42pAjl9a79.jpg", "actors": ["Samantha Colburn (Taylor)", "Cathy DeBuono (Cassie)", "Andy Gala (Bj)", "Liz McGeever (Minnie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [254634, 214328, 133535, 48660], "youtube_key": "WOGaj5lP7DI"}
