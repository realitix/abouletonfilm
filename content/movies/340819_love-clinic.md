Sin-seol is a virgin female urologist. Her main job is to give medical treatment to men who have lost confidence in sex. Seong-ki is a male obstetrician who suffers from a traumatic memory. After failing to deliver a baby in a Cesarean operation, he becomes impotent even with the sexiest girls. When the two become neighbors, they conflict with each other on everything. One night Seong-ki finds a blind drunk Sin-seol on the street, and carries her home. When she accidentally touches his thing, strangely enough, IT responds. Can the competent urologist Sin-seol finally help him to get IT up?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hdMA8T5xpchbdUF3K2gkz8lwq5.jpg", "actors": ["Oh Ji-ho (Wang Seong-ki)", "Kang Ye-won (Gil Sin-seol)", "Ha Ju-hee (Maeng In-young)", "Hong Yi-joo (Ahn Gong-joo)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
