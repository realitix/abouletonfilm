This was the contest which saw an over-confident Leonard lose his crown to Duran. Hearns had lost out to Hagler in 1985, and it was the latter that Leonard selected to take on in his comeback for the World Middleweight Championship.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
