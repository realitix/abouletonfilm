Andr\u00e9 returns to Maastricht bringing with him two wonderful guest choirs \u2013 the Harlem Gospel Choir and the Soweto Gospel Choir \u2013 and a very special guest: Oscar-winning actor Sir Anthony Hopkins! The Hollywood-based star is a great admirer of Andr\u00e9 Rieu and wrote a piece called \u201cAnd The Waltz Goes On\u201d specially with Rieu in mind.
