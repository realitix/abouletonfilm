Seemingly all at once, western consumerism arrived in Russia along with the hope that western prosperity would soon follow.'3OHA' examines the explosive changes in the cultural landscape of the region, from the last days of the Soviet Union to the modern feudalism of now. Via interviews with cultural luminaries like Artemy Troitsky, Igor Shulinsky, the recently incarcerated rapper, Husky, and 4 current day portraits of youth in Russia and Ukraine, a variety of refracted angles come into focus through fake nikes, clubs, drugs, instagram live, and the ghost-like echo of Swan Lake.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mpypOpW75cItrlAxJ85ckzQXUcG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
