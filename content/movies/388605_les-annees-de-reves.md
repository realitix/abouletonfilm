At that time, supporters of an independent Quebec began to consolidate their power under the Parti Qu\u00e9becois -- and the story of Louis and his wife Claudette are meant to illustrate this watershed in Quebec's history. As the film begins, Claudette and Louis are about to get married -- and their wedding day significantly coincides with preparations for the visit of Queen Elizabeth II. Years later, they are well-established in Montreal and are enjoying visits from their family -- and then their lives start to deteriorate. Louis is suddenly out of work, and as he faces the difficulties of finding another job -- and of living precariously -- he becomes more radical, less accepting of the status quo.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rbpkiSmVDBIiKyrsf9mC4TdUG7e.jpg", "actors": ["Gilbert Sicotte ()", "Anne-Marie Provencher ()", "Monique Mercure ()", "Amulette Garneau ()", "Guillaume Lemay-Thivierge ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
