An initially reserved Albert Hall crowd quickly responds to the uptempo excitement the band create, cast aside their inhibitions and make this a real party - some even joining the band on stage at one point. Originally formed in Miami in 1989 The Mavericks were the premier alternative country /tex-mex band of the 90's, with no fewer than 14 Billboard chart singles and 6 albums to their credit. The band finally split up in 2003, and this 59 minute DVD displays them at their best with all their hits.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zTer8NW2sV01scwlDnJK2d09jNE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
