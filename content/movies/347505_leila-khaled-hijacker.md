In 1969, she showed her grenades to the terrified passengers by order of the Che Guevara commando unit of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Through the ensuing media bombardment, she put the Palestinian nation on the global map. The pretty 24-year-old Leila became a hero to many Palestinians, including the Swedish/Palestinian teenager Lina Makboul, who is now a filmmaker. At least Leila dared to do something, Lina thought at the time. She visits Leila 35 years later with a camera, and finds a woman who does not regret anything.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/evHwSwuYpyl1cyLA9nYxUvk5PF8.jpg", "actors": ["Leila Khaled ()", "Uri Bar Lev ()", "Moshe Dayan ()", "Golda Meir ()", "Shimon Peres ()", "Lina Makboul ()", "Gamal Abdel Nasser ()", "Yitzhak Rabin ()", "Margareta Johnson (Air Hostess  TWA Flight 840)", "Robert Schaller (Passenger TWA Flight 840)", "Harry Oakley (Pilot TWA Flight 840)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
