Female dancers in mod clothes dance on the Eiffel Tower in comparison to the primitive dances of native Africans. A lone runner trains for a marathon, and a few animals are shown in their natural habitat. Commentary and modern jazz and pop music help to make this seem much longer than 66 minutes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ddURidUhRj7b6kn1o6Yb8wwmCv5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
