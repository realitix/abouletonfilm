After Andy removes a frog from under his wig, he begins. All is well until his shirt gets stuck on a nail; while he's fighting it, the orchestra breaks into a swinging tune. Back under control, a talkative squirrel in the audience annoys the pig sitting next to him; the pig zips the squirrel's mouth shut. A bird lands on Andy's baton; he waves it, and 2, 3, 4, and 5 birds appear (apparently, his baton's become a magic wand). He waves some more, and the birds disappear one by one, finally replaced with a very happy cat. Two ducks dance as ballerinas; then one fox and one duck, but the second duck is not as easily captured.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ze2cwNrbKi0FZqLF34M1vvkHAur.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
