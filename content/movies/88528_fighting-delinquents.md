Lean, mean, and stylish as always, this tale of youth-gone-wild is both vibrant and touching. Suzuki contrasts tranquil glimpses of traditional regional life with the emergence of the new rock 'n' roll youth culture and the greed and seething cynicism of encroaching Westernism.  Also released under the title \"Go To Hell, Hoodlums!\", this is a melodrama as colorful, shocking, and exhilarating as one would come to expect from Japan's master filmmaker.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qH1YkfKWgpuWbfJMhHsgXqGF8yN.jpg", "actors": ["K\u00f4ji Wada (Sadao Matsudaira)", "Mayumi Shimizu (Kazuko Izeki)", "Eitar\u00f4 Ozawa (Kanjuro Mizoguchi)", "Yoshiko Nezu (Miyo)", "Emiko Azuma (Yuki Maehara - Nanjo's Secretary)", "Chikako Hosokawa (Ikuyo Matsudaira)", "Toppa Utsumi (Uchiyama)", "Hiroshi Hijikata (The Person in Charge of the Accident)", "Kaku Takashina (Sanshiro Izeki, clan retainer)", "Saburo Hiromatsu (Kodaira)", "Hiroshi Kond\u00f4 (Nanjo - Kyokuto Kanko CEO)", "Yasuhiro Kameyama (Sanpei)", "Hajime Sugiyama (Shige)", "Naoyoshi Ozawa (Chikunen (as Naoyoshi Ozawa))", "Ryusei Ito ()", "Akira Hisamatsu ()", "Hatsuko Wakahara ()", "Dok\u00f4 Kihara ()", "Ei Shirai ()", "Teruaki Toki ()", "Koichiro Sakai ()", "Ayako Fukuda ()", "Yoshigi \u00d4ba ()", "Hiroshi Takao ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
