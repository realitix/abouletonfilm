Like a silly little girl. You're as cold as one already dead.\r\n\r\nPopcorn bonanza as the Underworld series passes by in a whirl of effects driven action. Kate Beckinsale returns as super sexy - latex wearing - vampire Selene, after having skipped the third movie, here added into the mix is that Selene is searching for her hybrid daughter, while the pesky humans are intent on wiping out all vampires and lycans.\r\n\r\nCue carnage. The story is very slight, the script equally so, where pretty much all roads lead to another action scene. So Selene leaps about a lot amongst blood, brains and beasties, the later of which fronted by a new giganticus hulkus werewolf. No actor in the film is asked to stretch their acting chops, but for fans of the series and action junkies in general, this is undeniably a good fun movie. 6/10"}], "recommandations_id": [12437, 834, 277, 71679]}
