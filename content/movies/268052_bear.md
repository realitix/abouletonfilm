Although not an overtly political work, for many viewers it raises sensitive issues about race, homoeroticism and violence. It depicts two naked men-one of whom is the artist-tussling and teasing one another in an encounter which shifts between tenderness and aggression. The film is silent but a series of stares, glances and winks between the protagonists creates an optical language of flirtation and threat.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Steve McQueen ()", "Vernon Douglas ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
