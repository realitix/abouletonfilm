His scathing comedy tackled tough topics no other comedian dared to touch. Fed up and disenfranchised with his career as a Pentacostal preacher, Sam left the ministry to try his hand at comedy. Almost immediately, and thanks in part to the foresight of Rodney Dangerfield who showcased Sam on an HBO special, his piercing scream, extreme humor and irreverent take on life attracted attention. Containing rare, early footage of Sam preaching and performing stand up at the world famous Comedy Store, the Award Winning \"Why Did We Laugh\" tells the story of a comedic genius who touched a deeper chord in people than most entertainers. Sadly, Sam was taken from us far too early, yet leaving us with a lasting and unique legacy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jttSRLXQZgoDkAhjNjcHO8Lu57t.jpg", "actors": ["Beverly D'Angelo (Herself)", "Rodney Dangerfield (Himself)", "Larry King (Himself)", "Bill Kinison (Himself)", "Sam Kinison (Himself (archive footage))", "Carl LaBove (Himself)", "Jay Leno (Himself)", "Tim Matheson (Himself)", "Dennis Miller (Himself)", "Richard Pryor (Himself)", "Judy Tenuta (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
