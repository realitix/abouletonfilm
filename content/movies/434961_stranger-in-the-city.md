See what was showing at La Continentale cinema on Tottenham Court Road, slip into a seedy strip club, cut a rug to some cool jazz, and pay a virtual visit to the birthplace of British rock 'n' roll, legendary Soho music venue The 2i\u2019s Coffee Bar.  The 2i's Coffee Bar, established in 1956, was run by two Australian ex-wrestlers, Ray Hunter and Paul Lincoln (aka Doctor Death).
