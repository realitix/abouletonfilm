Heidi has a gift of three carved wooden figures made by a craftsman neighbour: Caspar, Melchior and Balthazar. However, rather than gold, frankincense, and myrrh, her grandfather and the village doctor gradually teach Heidi the idea that the gifts they bring are faith, charity and hope.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nAFuBUAuvAim0AGahEgHn1rGbms.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
