The Circuit Carole of the title refers to a motorbike racetrack. Jeanne and her 20-year old daughter Marie share a small apartment in a working-class Parisian neighborhood; the two live harmoniously, but the daughter is restless and anxious to set out on her own. Marie then takes a job in a northern suburb and their lives are forever changed. The racetrack is near her work; Marie is enthralled by the racers and their fast machines. Along with her new boyfriend, a racer, Marie begins riding herself. She then moves out of her mother's flat, leaving Jeanne bereft of companionship and a purpose in her life. Her silent, deeply internalized grief eventually drives her completely mad.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9m3mrbnosbwJVlfMwbOji6wOtOO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
