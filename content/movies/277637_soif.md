Alcohol is the essence of her being. She imbibes her youth and becomes completely absorbed by the desire to satisfy her thirst. Moving from parties to binge drinking, pleasure to distress, joy to delirium, she lets herself be lulled by the undulating waves of bottles. She floats in the intoxicating liquid, sees her childhood re-emerge, and feels as if she is a tiny fish lost in an ocean of madness. Her craving for alcohol engenders a burning passion. Drinking becomes a fatal embrace... On the verge of drowning in the torrent of this insane obsession, will she find the strength to rise to the surface?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/diDLrujqYdIM3XjjixrjjNZlV5n.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
