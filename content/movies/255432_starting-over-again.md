In the five years that they were together, they brought out the best in each other, which included Marco\u2019s unrealized dream of becoming a chef. Together, they worked towards their dream of opening up a restaurant, but when Ginny realized her own pursuits were different from his, she rejected his wedding proposal and left the country for a Masters degree in Architecture. At present, Ginny co-owns a one-stop Architecture and Interior Design firm specializing in Restoration. She receives an email from Marco, which was written and sent after their break-up, meant to be read four years later. It makes her feel even more regretful of leaving the love of her life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c5qtYwbXV2KjD56C5mOZA4BmR76.jpg", "actors": ["Toni Gonzaga (Patty)", "Piolo Pascual (Marco Villanueva)", "Iza Calzado (Genina 'Ginny' Gonzales)", "Lito Pimentel (Mang Ben)", "Joross Gamboa (Ali)", "Edgar Allan Guzman (Baba)", "Cai Cortez (Beb)", "Beauty Gonzalez (Wella)", "Bryan Santos (Barry Maniego)", "Ryan Yllana (Peewee)", "Ni\u00f1a Dolino (Ms. Lala)", "Cecil Paz (Professor)", "Liza Lorena (Lola Alicia)", "Yayo Aguila (Dina)", "Rolando Inocencio (Dean Dimalanta)", "Winnie Mate (Marco's Mother)", "Gonzalo Gonzales (Marco's Father)", "Bella Mercado (Manang Suping)", "Me-Anne Flores (Receptionist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [333660, 99460, 298257, 134380], "youtube_key": "TYKGY2NrBYY"}
