On the market, food, potteries, salt, cotton, and flocks are exchanged... a Mossi magician prepares in his hut, from mille and tree barks that he collected in the bush, a magical spell to make bigger the women too thin. He practices divination with \"cauries\" and by tracing a geomantic theme on the ground. He sacrifices animals to the genie that guides him. During his collective celebration to protect the village against evil, a magician, representing the entire magician community, dances on the drum rhythms up to ecstasy. The leader of the village, the magicians, and the young boys attend the sacrifice yearly offered to the genie of the mountain, protector of the village.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
