It left its audience hovering between hushed reverence and deafening\r exultation. The Golden Hall of Vienna's Musikverein was the dazzling venue for the\r live recording of this concert celebrating the 100th birthday of Herbert von Karajan.\r And there Karajan s Berliner never sounded better, evoking a time which selfconfidently\r sought the private and subjective in music, and believed it could find\r them in the mirror of the works (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung). It is a concert\r that commemorates Herbert von Karajan for the ages in a supremely moving manner.  Beethoven: Violin Concerto, Tchaikovsky: Symphony No. 6, Bach: Sarabande,br.
