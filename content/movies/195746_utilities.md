She is assisted by contributions, and the bill is paid entirely in pennies, though the clerk is belatedly told that payment is not accepted in such a large quantity of coins. Unfortunately, the electric company fails to reconnect the power due to a communications snafu, and the elderly woman is taken to hospital suffering hypothermia. Hunt sets off on a vendetta of revenge, sabotaging assorted support systems.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tYCaesjH2jySQDoQWxn0HtDfYr4.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Hays (Bob Hunt)", "Brooke Adams (Marion Edwards)", "John Marley (Roy Blue)", "James Blendick (Kenneth Knight)", "Helen Burns (Ruby Blue)", "Benjamin Gordan (Eddie)", "Jane Mallett (Dr. Martha)", "John Corbett (Reporter #1)", "Don Lamont (Ted)", "Steve Pernie (Walt)", "Shelby Gregory (Tom Walker)", "Margaret Pacsu (Miss Beaton)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Id80lZGyMso"}
