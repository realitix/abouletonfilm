This is the terrifying reality Alaina finds herself in when she moves in to the house her mother died in. At first she thinks it's the loss of her mother that is haunting her, but she is soon shown it is something far more malicious and unrelenting. The spirit taunts her as it invades her body, mind, and soul, completely trapping her. Alaina has to fight for answers on what really happened to her mother if she has any hopes of survival.
