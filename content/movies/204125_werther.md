The setting is changed to Spain, and Werther (Eusebio Poncela) has taken a job tutoring the son of an estranged husband and wife. The boy's mother is a surgeon and therefore a rather uncommon woman for her society. She and Werther gradually become romantically involved, and his feelings for her begin to run much deeper than is apparent on the surface.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qcx8GnbQkC7wFI7WaWbpuywMJO.jpg", "actors": ["Eusebio Poncela ()", "Mercedes Sampietro ()", "F\u00e9odor Atkine ()", "Vicky Pe\u00f1a ()", "Luis Hostalot ()", "Emilio Guti\u00e9rrez Caba ()", "Miguel Arribas ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
