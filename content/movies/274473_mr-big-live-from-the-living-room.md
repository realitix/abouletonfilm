What If... had gone gold in Japan and the band lined up 11 Japanese dates in support of the release. At the end of January 2011, during a weeklong promotional trip to promote the album and tour, they were invited to the WOWOW TV Studios in Tokyo to perform a special acoustic show. When the talk of a broadcast first came up, Mr. Big wanted to present something different than they've ever done before, thus the idea of an acoustic show came about and a string quintet was brought in to enhance the project even more. The result from that magic night in Tokyo is now here: 10 Mr. Big classics in a completely new and fresh setting and a unique portrait of the band during their very first acoustic show.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a1Dp0HkVoLNQLQq7G8X67M8uzgH.jpg", "actors": ["Eric Martin (Vocals)", "Paul Gilbert (Guitar)", "Billy Sheehan (Bass)", "Pat Torpey (Drums/Percussion)", "Mr. Big ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
