Starting with the familiar premise of the absent woman, so popular with Downtown filmmakers, Vogl drains his storytelling of any hints of noir stylization. Instead of nighttime scenes, slick streets, and dark alleys, he shoots documentary-style on the nondescript, sunlit streets of Brooklyn, Manhattan, and City Island in a manner that casually references the art-film angst of Michelangelo Antonioni.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Patti Astor ()", "Eric Mitchell ()", "Diego Cortez ()", "Earl Garrett Jr. ()", "Jim Jarmusch ()", "Gary Indiana ()", "Raoul Mignuchi ()", "Massimo Audiello ()", "Susan Enslin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
