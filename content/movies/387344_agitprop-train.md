Poets like Mayakovsky and the film maker Dziga Vertov were on that train. Vertov appears at the end of this clip wearing a funny furry hat ushering a bunch of kids onto the train. Look out for him as he went on to make Man With A Movie Camera.  The Agitprop (Department for agitation and propaganda) at the time of the USSR, had spread the ideas of Marxism-Leninism, the propaganda organ used various means to convince the recalcitrant regime, including a train decorated with colors in which many Soviet revolutionary intellectuals circulated (as the poet Mayakovsky or director Dziga Vertov).
