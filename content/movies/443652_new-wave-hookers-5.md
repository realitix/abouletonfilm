Wielding his now familiar formula of flashy special effects, MTV-style camera work, and brooding art direction, Ninn throws in a bit of uncharacteristic slapstick and cartoon-style humor to create a whole new chapter in one of the most popular adult series ever made. With a plot too weird to describe here, NWH5 is a surreal saga populated by clowns and Japanese businessmen, talking televisions and mad scientists, monks and pimps, and other additions of the Ninn psyche.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x2iCM6zhUGos5wEEZVruNP89xRB.jpg", "actors": ["Asia Carrera (Elevator Operator #1)", "Ron Jeremy (Silky Smooth)", "Sindee Coxx (Megatron Girl)", "Anna Malle (Nurse Lacyunderall)", "Jeanna Fine (Nurse Goodbody)", "Stacy Valentine (New Wave Hooker #2)", "Juli Ashton (Miss Webster)", "Felecia (Elevator Operator #2)", "Kim Kitaine (Megatron Girl)", "Ashley Renee (Megatron Girl)", "Roxanne Hall (Megatron Girl)", "Sunset Thomas (New Wave Hooker #1)", "Sharon Kane (Loretta)", "Nikita Gross ()", "Lea Martini (Future N.W.
