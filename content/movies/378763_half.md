When her colleague is assaulted by a male customer, she steps in to help, only to accidentally kill the assaulter. At the court, Min-a insists that she had no choice ? she had to protect her colleague - but the situation is not favorable to her. Taking advantage of her sexual identity, the prosecutor drives the case as if the murder were a result out of jealousy, and Min-a\u2019s own lawyer does not pay attention to her situation. Not until Min-a is placed in a men\u2019s jail and is seized with terror do the human rights issues for transgender people emerge. Min-a is finally transferred to a prison for females, but still she suffers from misunderstanding. Presenting the transgender human rights issues as a court drama, this film tries to correct the myriad misunderstandings toward transgender people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7rYWvgMw7u7Jz8sjFmNd9Jv4Fpf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
