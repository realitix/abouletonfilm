The opening scene as a mysterious figure enters a building and almost steps on a pool of blood left by a murder victim is handled with some style but is one of the few visual treats in a very static film.  \r\n\r\nLugosi is very engaged in his part, talking much faster and with greater passion than his lugubrious Dracula performance, indicating the latter was very much an interpretation of his original stage part.  His dramatic confrontation with the suspects is full of passion and a certain intensity.\r\n\r\nOf the remaining cast John Davidson as Edward Wales is the sole standout, bringing a creepy intensity and mystery to his role, which is portrayed as one of mystery.\r\n\r\nExisting prints of this film are fairly washed out and damaged which reduces the ability of the modern viewer to identify clearly what is going on.  A full restoration might be of benefit if quality elements exist but this is far from being the forgotten masterpiece of early sound horror that a viewer might have hoped for."}], "recommandations_id": [53523, 53528], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
