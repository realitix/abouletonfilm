He is Japanese foreign diplomat, Kosaku Kuroda, and he\u2019s here under orders of his supervisor at the Foreign Ministry, Hiroshi Kataoka (Kiichi Nakai), to aid in the safeguarding of Japanese citizens. Kuroda\u2019s main contacts at the Japanese embassy consist of Ambassador Kikuhara, Counselor Nishino, and fellow diplomatic envoys Haba and Tanimoto. All are busy preparing for the visit of Japanese Foreign Minister Kawagoe due to arrive for the high-profile G8 foreign minister\u2019s meeting. Meanwhile, somewhere on the festively-lit streets of the city, a young Japanese girl has suddenly gone missing. Is it an abduction simply for ransom? Or could it be a prelude to terror?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ewLznFIUgCyYDhmmeHME3lhs332.jpg", "actors": ["Yuji Oda (Kosaku Kuroda)", "Erika Toda (Kanae Adachi)", "Koichi Sato (Masaki Fujii)", "Nene Otsuka (Yoshimi Haba)", "Atsushi Ito (Mikiyasu Taniki)", "Akira Onodera (Kiyofumi Kikuhara)", "Mitsuru Hirata (Wataru Kawagoe)", "Shir\u00f4 Sano (Michio Nishino)", "Ayane Omori (Madoka Yagami)", "Sarah Brightman (Herself)", "Masaharu Fukuyama (Shogo Saeki)", "Yuki Amami (Saeko Yakami)", "Kiichi Nakai (Hiroshi Kataoka (voice))", "Nico Toffoli (Street Fighter)", "Ugo De Cesare ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
