Having retreated to Florida, they live a simple horticultural life. But white plantation owners, angry at the increasing numbers of black slaves fleeing to Seminole protection, want to take their land. Plantation owner Raynes, in particular, has convinced the military to wipe out the Seminoles. His rival Moore, a sawmill owner from the North who has a Seminole wife, is against slavery and considers it unprofitable. Chief Osceola sees the coming danger; he tries to avoid provoking the whites, but cannot prevent the war that breaks out in 1835.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3SDfO3ML9YqjN3o7VfeUMXLf3ky.jpg", "actors": ["Gojko Miti\u0107 (Osceola)", "Horst Schulze (William Raynes)", "Iurie Darie (Richard Moore)", "Karin Ugowski (Gladis Raynes)", "Kati Bus (Rhea)", "Pepa Nikolova (Rhea)", "Iskra Radewa (Che-Cho-Ter)", "Audrey Pankey (Benjamin)", "William Aniche (Robin)", "Boubacar Tour\u00e9 (Black Panther)", "Josef Quartey (Tom)", "Almamy Soumar\u00e9 (Joshua)", "Gerry Wolff (Gouverneur)", "Monika Woytowicz (Peggy Kerry)", "Kurt Kachlicki (Captain Stock)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
