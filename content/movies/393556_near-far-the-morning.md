She meets Vic at the market where she works. They fall in love, they marry and as they start a new life in the city, Vic is wanted by the police. When the police closes on him, he tries to escape, but did not. He pretends that he found work somewhere far while he is in jail, so Amy waits for him. After nine years he does not show up, so she starts to work at a large store where he meets Mr. Yap. Mr. Yap is the rich Chinese who owns the grocery store, and he immediately falls in love with Amy. Amy hesitates, but finally gives in and marries the wealthy man. When Vic returns, conflict ensues. Amy must choose between the two men, but could not: she loves Vic, but Yap provides for her. She is torn, until the situation is decided for her.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Dante Rivero (Vic)", "Elizabeth Oropesa (Amy)", "George Estregan (Yap)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
