Praying to and fondling a priapic mushroom, she is unaware of the evil rapist shadowing her. When the rape occurs, it is in long shot, hidden from view, under a huge tree. Articles of clothes and her cross sail through the air; the tree - entirely dominating the screen - sways rhythmically and repeatedly. A few minutes later it stops; then another tree, a few feet away, begins to sway in identical fashion. The rapist finally emerges, exhausted.\" (Amos Vogel, Film as a Subversive Art)", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/li7sZmjE4dilyfeHOkZmvZ3YAfl.jpg", "actors": ["Laura Klein (Sister Petrunkinsky)", "Henk Kort (The Rapist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [162672, 130838, 148626, 441812], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
