Jess Kilroy - musician, climber and conservationist - travels to wilderness areas around the West creating music from the natural sounds she finds there, with the goal of sparking people's love for these wild lands. The Creek Sessions follows Jess on a sensory journey to create music in Utah's Indian Creek, wooing us with the splendor of the desert, and reminding us that wild places are worth protecting not simply for their landscapes, but for their soundscapes too.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Jessica Kilroy (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "FJcZdW7IYG0"}
