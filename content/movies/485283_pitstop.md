Maggie escapes her loneliness and the chaos of her family by entering the strangely beautiful world she discovers through the viewfinder of her snap-n-shoot camera. Yet, unable to trust that what she sees is worth capturing, she never takes a picture. When the family makes a pit stop in the middle of nowhere, Maggie's feelings of being invisible are intensified after she is accidentally left behind. There at the gas station she meets June, the desert-worn, reclusive proprietor who proves more than just a passing influence on this little girl's journey to find her own voice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iyF648gSZZ6GpJu09GNhZGcYvMJ.jpg", "actors": ["Shawnna Youngquist (Maggie)", "Andrea Helene (June)", "Gretchen Koerner (Connie)", "Blake Oswald (Joe)", "Mary Day (Sister / mary)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
