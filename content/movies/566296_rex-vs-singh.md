Their story becomes a fascinating case study of Vancouver power relations: how police corruption, racism, homophobia, and a covert \"whites-only\" immigration policy, conspired to maintain the status quo of this colonial port city. Told in four parts, by three separate directors, the film is a hybrid of film forms including drama, documentary and musical.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
