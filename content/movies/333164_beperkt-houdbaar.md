Sunny Bergman asks in whose interest it is for her and other women to have these concerns, what's at stake, what's to gain and what's to lose. In this film, Bergman looks for the cause, the effects, and possible solutions for the Western preoccupation with our image.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iB8Sku2Q2JTi1l0ijow8Sp17NLz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
