Bizarrely, we then go on to see the lead actress kidnap, torture, starve, take out her frustrations with a set of knuckledusters on, and yes, even rape and murder, a man, to absolutely zero repercussions. Which renders the \"violence specifically against women\" disclaimer, a bit of an odd choice. Odd, but not what actually bothered me about _SheChotic_. What bothered me was the acting, dialogue, soundtrack, camerawork (one conversation done entirely in rotating perimeter made me physically ill), editing (plays out like it was done by someone who thought that a bad episode of _Angel_ was the highest level of quality one can aspire to), effects, the plethora of dropped plot threads, and the **absolute nonsense** ending.\r\n\r\nThis movie was an enormous struggle to get through, normally something this bad I will turn off part way through, but I guess the fact that I didn't means it's better than the ones that I did.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
