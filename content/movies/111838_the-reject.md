On was once a reporter, but now makes his living working as a public relations man for a banking firm. On is in his forties and has started to sink into a mid-life depression. On's wife has left him and while he tries to keep in touch with her and his daughter, he feels they're drifting away from him. On often finds himself retreating into a world of daydreams, which becomes all the more common after he loses his job. On struggles to drown in ennui with alcohol, gambling and meaningless sex, but matters only get worse as he learns that his elderly mother's health is failing, and he can no longer keep up with the bills for her medical care. When On discovers some forgotten savings, he sets out on a vacation in hopes of recapturing his muse, with his beautiful and loyal secretary in tow. Film received its American premiere at the 2008 Palm Springs Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3e0NmlrV3RKyz668iJzP75Kqw8g.jpg", "actors": ["Svetozar Cvetkovi\u0107 (On)", "Aleksandra Jankovi\u0107 (\u0160efica)", "Ljiljana Me\u0111e\u0161i (Lepa)", "Renata Ulmanski (Angelina)", "Ana Maljevi\u0107 (Gala)", "Milica Spasojevi\u0107 (\u0106erka)", "Sne\u017eana Nik\u0161i\u0107 (Gospo\u0111a Petrija)", "Nenad \u0106iri\u0107 (Diler Zoki)", "Ana Frani\u0107 (D\u017eeki)", "Tihomir Stani\u0107 (Mu\u0161ka persona)", "Svetislav Gonci\u0107 (Mu\u0161ka persona)", "Sonja Vuki\u0107evi\u0107 (\u017denska persona)", "Vanja Andri\u0107 (De\u010dak)", "Miodrag Krstovi\u0107 (Spodoba)", "Danica Maksimovi\u0107 (Prostitutka)", "Du\u0161anka Stojanovi\u0107 (Upravnica doma)", "Nada Vuk\u010devi\u0107 (\u017dena)", "Ratiborka \u0106eramilac (Taksistkinja)", "Milica Gutovi\u0107 (Konobarica)", "Goran Bukili\u0107 (Pokera\u0161)", "Jovan Osmajli\u0107 (Pokera\u0161)", "Jelena Mr\u0111a ()", "Ivana \u0110oki\u0107 ()", "Na\u0111a Sekuli\u0107 ()", "Slobodan Golubovi\u0107-Leman ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
