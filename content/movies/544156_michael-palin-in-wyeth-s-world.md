Fascinated by his iconic painting Christina's World, Palin goes in search of the real life stories that inspired this and Wyeth's other depictions of the American landscape and its hard grafting inhabitants. Tracking down the farmers, friends and family featured in Wyeth's magically real work, Palin builds a picture of an eccentric, enigmatic and driven painter. He also gets a rare interview with Helga, the woman who put Wyeth back in the headlines when the press discovered he had been painting her nude, compulsively but secretly for 15 years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hXPa0eI0hGUiC1c3bf5grQH6b6P.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Palin (Himself)", "Andrew Wyeth (Himself)", "Helga Testorf (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
