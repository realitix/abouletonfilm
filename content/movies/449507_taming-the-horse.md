Dong has remained a dreamer besotted with rock, an incensed body struggling to find money (he comes up with a jade business which does not work out), love, sex and, above all, to live following his own conceptions of liberty, under the ambiguous gaze of his parents and his \u201csuccessful\u201d brother.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uXdEkin1z36FqUb8XIjy6dY8kYK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
