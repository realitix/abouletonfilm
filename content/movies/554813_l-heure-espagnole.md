The title's literal translation is \"The Spanish Hour\", but here the word \"heure\" refers more generally to \"time\", reminiscent of the clich\u00e9, \"How They Keep Time in Spain\". The work's Latin atmosphere is reinforced through Ravel's incorporation of dance music like the malague\u00f1a, the jota, and the haba\u00f1era.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xqxpAWynDcowEdknENgJj0EtmMn.jpg", "actors": ["Elliot Madore ()", "Fran\u00e7ois Piolino ()", "St\u00e9phanie d\u2019Oustrac ()", "Alek Shrader ()", "Paul Gay ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
