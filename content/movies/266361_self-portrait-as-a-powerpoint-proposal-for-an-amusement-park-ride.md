It includes ideas for a 'Make Your Own Sandwich Shop' and a secret password for having sex in the supply closet. The proposal, which is created entirely in PowerPoint, takes the viewer through the very basic planning stages for the ride but then transitions to actually becoming the ride itself.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
