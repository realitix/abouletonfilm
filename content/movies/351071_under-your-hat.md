Together with his wife (Cicely Courtneidge) he attempts to recover a secret carburretor stolen by enemy agents.\r\n\r\nAt first his wife suspects that Jack is having an affair with his glamorous co-star as he is behaving suspiciously. Jack eventually reveals he been asked to go undercover.\r\n\r\nThis is a rather heavy handed musical-dance caper. It moves briskly enough with some silliness but is not that funny. Hulbert is amiable enough but Courtneidge overpowers the film by being over the top."}], "recommandations_id": [338013, 219838], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
