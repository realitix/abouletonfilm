The Jail Superintendent sends a helicopter to pick him to hang Billa, a man found guilty of killing 23 persons, and Shiva accordingly prepares his rope to carry out his unpleasant task. He returns home, ensures Ganesh finishes his school with honors, and then sends him to live with the Jail Superintendent and his daughter, Gauri, to study in college in order to become a police inspector. Shiva is informed that Ganesh has done well in his college examinations. Hoping to see his son back home, Shiva and Parvati will soon be devastated when they will be told that Ganesh has been arrested by the police.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bRcvDUAxrAWkw4Jh3vC9EdEA0Ky.jpg", "actors": ["Om Puri (Shiva Sathe)", "Gulshan Grover ()", "Tom Alter ()", "Shreyas Talpade ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
