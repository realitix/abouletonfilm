About 10,000 Zanskaris live in the isolated valley. In winter, mountain passes are blocked, the summer Jeep road closes and buses stop. Two decades ago, three friends founded a ski school - to enable winter travel in the valley, improve quality of life, and to encourage young people to stay in Zanskar by helping establish a culture of mountain sports. The film tells the story of this friendship, the ski school and the development of skiing in the area. Along the way a bigger question is raised. Most recently, the federal government announced a major road building project that will provide year round access to Zanskar. How can Zanskar's wilderness be preserved? It is only a matter of time before the winter road is completed, and the \"Big India\" rushes in.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mxx8dt6py0sM0s28RCPzMdo2etF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
