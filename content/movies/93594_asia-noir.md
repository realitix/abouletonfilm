Director David Aaron Clark says, The sex is the best I've ever shot. I was allowed to cast whomever I wanted, and the actresses are all favorites - working with Sabrine Maui for the first time was a blast, and I had just shot a great scene with Nyomi and Lyla, so they just hit the next level for me. And working with Marcus for the first time was an incredible pleasure - I can't think of a male performer more capable of being smart, funny and a force of nature like that all at the same time. Darren James also starts proving himself here as an essential performer. A film crew from 60 MINUTES was present to document one day of the shoot for an upcoming segment on the adult industry.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9fiwcShOAnic1Qlirlk0sHfJtTL.jpg", "actors": ["Darren James ()", "Guy DiSilva ()", "Kimmy Kahn ()", "Kohl Mynah ()", "Lucy Lee ()", "Lyla Lei ()", "Mr. Marcus ()", "Nyomi Marcela ()", "Sabrine Maui ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
