Good idea though. It was interesting to see the poor deal with the night of terror this time. The acting wasn't great nor was it great the first time though. The first film did have a few good actors though. And the jump scares failed most of the time.\r\n\r\nThe last thirty minutes reminded me of the satirical class dividing futures of 'Black Mirror', ' Hostel' and 'The Hunger Games' but it lacked the interesting writing.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u00bd"}, {"pseudo": "inaneswine", "content": "A total mess of a film. It clearly tries to expand on the bigger picture that we missed out on last time - but the fact is that past the initial frightening idea, _The Purge: Anarchy_ is an exercise in mindless bloodshed (as is the eponymous Purge itself), and lacks emotional depth or a coherent story."}], "recommandations_id": [158015, 316727, 91586, 250546], "youtube_key": "XzFCDqKE4yA"}
