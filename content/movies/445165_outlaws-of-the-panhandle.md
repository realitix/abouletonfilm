For the moment, however, the star is cast as Jim Endicott, bound and determined to put an end to the underhanded activities of gin-mill operator Faro Jack Vaughn (Norman Willis). The villain's strategy is to get the local cowpunchers tanked up on rotgut that they'll prove to be easy pickings for a gang of rustlers-and will be unable to complete work on a railroad spur which will bypass the outlaws' hideaway.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9ZFl5yi6fHZW8IyqI0Gw8lF66Si.jpg", "actors": ["Charles Starrett (Jim Endicott)", "Frances Robinson (Doris Burnett)", "Stanley Brown (Neil Vaughn)", "Norman Willis ('Faro Jack' Vaughn)", "Ray Teal (Walt Burnett)", "Lee Prather (Banker Elihu Potter)", "Bob Nolan (Bob)", "Steve Clark (Lon Hewitt)", "Bud Osborne (Mart Monahan)", "Eddie Laughton (Henchman Chad)", "Richard Fiske (Henchman Britt)", "Jack Low (Henchman Dogger)", "Sons of the Pioneers (Musicians, Cow Hands)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
