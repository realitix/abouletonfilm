He is led astray by his friend Ramanathan (Balaiah). Drink and women lead to degradation and ignoble living. Poor gentle, loving Leelavathi bears the brunt of his drunken cruelty. In an enebriated condition, he fires his pistol at his friend Parasuraman and runs away from the police. He comes across a corpse and, after exchanging clothes with it, he flees to Ceylon where he obtains work at a tea estate. He finds a treasure and returns to India a wealthy man, but forced to remain in disguise. He is soon discovered, arrested, tried for murder, and sentenced to death. When the hangman is about to pull the lever, police inspector Rangaiah Naidu (Ramachandran) shows up with Parasuraman. The murdered man was someone else, not Parasuraman, and the killer was Ramanathan. Radhakrishnan is acquitted; he and Leelavathi re-unite.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rixTYanLoUUCpZxk9GLDmxMtFNh.jpg", "actors": ["M. K. Radha (Radhakrishnan)", "M. S.
