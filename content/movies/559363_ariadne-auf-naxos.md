At the centre of this production from Katharina Thoma is the noble, tragic figure of the abandoned Ariadne herself, in a haunting performance from Soile Isokoski, 'with brilliant support from the pit' (The Independent).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3aASpko31OalAtOWBGlwF7Gzlxz.jpg", "actors": ["Ana Maria Labin ()", "Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke ()", "Adriana Di Paola ()", "Gabriela I\u015ftoc ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
