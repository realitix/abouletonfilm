Though most of the songs are not holiday ones, they come from Bush\u2019s first three albums (Never for Ever her third album would be released in 1980 after this 1979 TV special was taped).  The performances include costumes, choreographed dances and a wind machine, creating an eclectic music TV special to say the least.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fJvCqaewxJNZadVnrltWfPDVNC5.jpg", "actors": ["Kate Bush (Herself)", "Peter Gabriel (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "0ymxgS4XHRA"}
