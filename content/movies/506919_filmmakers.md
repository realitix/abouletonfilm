In each portrait, Iimura attempts to copy the styles and traits of each artist (Vanderbeek's constantly moving camera; Mekas' experiments with film speed; Warhol's use of flashes of white against a black background), while briefly commenting on the images being shown. The film serves effectively as an introduction to the film styles of these artists.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7v7HQUW8KQrOMfdVgIvc5ipH7lG.jpg", "actors": ["Stan Brakhage (Himself)", "Stan Vanderbeek (Himself)", "Jack Smith (Himself)", "Jonas Mekas (Himself)", "Takahiko Iimura (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
