When German artist Bernd Hoffmann (Michael K\u00f6nig) arrives in Lisbon to oversee the installation of his paintings in a joint exhibition with another Berlin artist, Hanna Brauer (Charlotte Schwab), Hanna never shows up. Hoffmann is puzzled because he is certain he saw a video sequence with Hanna at the exhibition, and he begins to look for her. Another Lisbon cultural center, a theater, is also having problems that may or may not be related -- and the mystery deepens when Hanna is found dead, either by her own hand, or murdered.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h1xUjxlt2ZWHf7n1bbMdsldcQJQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
