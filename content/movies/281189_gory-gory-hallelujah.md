When all four are rejected, they hit the road on bad-ass motorcycles, bound for glory in New York City. But when a run-in with a gang of Elvises ends in murder, they find themselves taken prisoner in a little town called Jackville - where folk don't take kindly to blasphemers. The Jesuses fall prey to an evil conspiracy that can only lead to the Apocalypse.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hshvQD8TbxYEr3RaMvnAKVKABH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
