He hears from an older student a \"welcome party ghost story\" about a ghost which appears once every four years at the welcome party for new students. He sees a girl who bears a striking likeness to the ghost in the story: long black hair, large eyes, and almost transparent white skin. Impulsively, Iwakiri asks her to be in his film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/be7m6yrSuam5efQB2UHheLrMA4m.jpg", "actors": ["Minami Mio (Minami)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
