Before, their problems were oppression and poverty. Now, their problem is mostly poverty - and plenty of it. In this grim comedy (to call it a black comedy would be to paint too perky a picture of it), Vasile (Gheorghe Dinica)has a wife whom he's fond of, and a mistress, whom he's fonder of. He manages a nearly abandoned movie theater, and makes just about nothing doing it. When his wife announces she's pregnant, he nearly goes frantic trying to find money to get her an abortion. However, what truly sends him over the edge is when his mistress decides to become a prostitute because, after all, the money is good. These two situations send him straight to the loony bin, and when he gets out, he discovers that his wife has rented their apartment to pornographic filmmakers, and guess who's starring in them?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9h2xly07XJ8J29boY6eF4jIdadB.jpg", "actors": ["Gheorghe Dinic\u0103 (Vasile Potop)", "Coca Bloos (Carolina Potop)", "Valentin Teodosiu (Politistul Misu)", "Lia Bugnar (Stela)", "Valentin Uritescu ()", "Geo Costiniu ()", "Jana Corea ()", "Flavius Constantinescu ()", "Nicolae Praida ()", "Paul Chiributa ()", "Eugen Cristian Motriuc ()", "Bujor Macrin ()", "Dumitru Palade ()", "Camelia Zorlescu ()", "Ion Popa ()", "Eugen Racoti ()", "Mihail Vasile Boghita ()", "Ion Sima ()", "Dan Cristescu ()", "Milica Militaru ()", "Marinel Feraru ()", "Catalin Stan ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
