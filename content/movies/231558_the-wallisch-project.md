This new style of project allowed Wallisch to focus all of his efforts on one film and be fully involved with the entire process from start to finish.  The result is roughly eight minutes of non-stop, jaw-dropping action that viewers are sure to eat up, and Wallisch is proud to call his own.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x5GmNpVyJyBSpor5UqOMAyg1KgV.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Wallisch ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
