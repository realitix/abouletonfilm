The fake doctor gives Charley a package to deliver to Mr. Henderson, the \"Supreme Crown of the Knights of the Brown Derby.\" At the hotel, hosting a convention of \"Brown Derbies,\" Charley suffers a dizzy spell and the only place he can find to sit down is in Mr. Henderson's lap, where he recites \"Mary Had a Little Lamb.\" Mr. Henderson, it is revealed, also suffers from \"Tetra-Ethyl.\" Seized by an attack, Henderson sits down and tries to recite \"Who Killed Cock Robin,\" but forgets the lines, which Charley and Henderson's daughter, Betty, sing in a song together. That, coming at the end of the second reel,is all it takes for Charley and Betty to decide to get married.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Charley Chase (Charley)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
