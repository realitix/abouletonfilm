Shot by prolific amateur filmmaker Harold Street, the abrupt ending and the placement of an end title card in the middle suggests this isn't his finished version - but the film nonetheless shows off a cinematic eye for framing and a sophisticated sense of narrative.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rA1rmC6lZJHltuTf7H7Zqfft5A6.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
