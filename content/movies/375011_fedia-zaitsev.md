The school has been freshly painted and cleaned. In his  excitement he draws a \u2018little man\u2019 with an umbrella on the wall inside  his classroom. In class, the teacher notices the drawing and asks the  children to admit to the wrongdoing. Fedia rubs his hands together  so that they appear clean, but his friend, with whom he has shaken  hands earlier, has dirty hands and is blamed for the drawing. Fedia  goes home without saying anything, but he is unable to sleep peacefully  because of his guilty conscience. In his dreams his toys begin to  taunt him. It is the Little Man himself who decides that the truth must  be known. He goes to Fedia\u2019s home and on the way he meets other  children\u2019s drawings including an animal of unknown breed that agrees  to give him a ride to Fedia\u2019s home. With the Little Man\u2019s encouragement  Fedia agrees to admit his guilt the next day at school.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
