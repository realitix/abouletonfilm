Equally, Gallagher combines aspects of different cinemas \u2013 documentary, structural, poetic, narrative, and personal \u2013 skillfully interweaving all the elements into a complex yet coherent and surprisingly moving statement on the human condition. The most brilliant film on its subject I\u2019ve ever seen, Time Being is cool and non-academic yet deeply engaged, and beautifully shot. An educational film in the best sense.  \u2014Tony Reif", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
