This is neither future nor past, but rather somewhere lost. Somewhere other. The film uses a mix of 2D and CG animation to explore what happens to a lonely figure when a mysterious anomaly appears on the fringes of the landscape. It aims to capture the strange sense of ennui, loss and anxiety that feels appropriate for our times.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hNZque5nFPXiWNHy1aMSOztEYVs.jpg", "actors": ["Phill Hosking ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
