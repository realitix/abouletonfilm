Reggie's best friend is dead, and the pain of his loss leads the hardened player on a quest to ensure that the killer pays for his crime. Upon tracking the killer to a gym, Reggie enters, gun in hand and ready to avenge his friend's death. As the other players declare that no one will die on their court without a fair trial, they listen to both sides of the story to determine if justice will be served with a bullet, or whether the suspected killer will live to play another game.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8fwJLxXKZfaPTWBgMAcHRtY9UkG.jpg", "actors": ["Charles Robinson ()", "Alexandria Hee ()", "Stanley Malveaux ()", "Lorenzo Rayburn ()", "Ajai Sanders (Yolanda)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
