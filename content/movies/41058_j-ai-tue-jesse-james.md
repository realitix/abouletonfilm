All the quirks and peccadilloes of the human condition are explored (the detail of Ford's torments and troubles superbly told), which is something of a rarity for a late 1940s \"B\" standard Western. The use of close-ups are to purposely highlight the psychological discord on show, marking this out as a good pointer to the later work of its maverick director.

Edward Bromberg. 7/10"}], "recommandations_id": [37329, 77123, 63143, 42261]}
