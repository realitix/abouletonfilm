AFTER THE WAVE tells the untold story of this epic forensic operation in Thailand to identify and return home the bodies of over 5,000 victims, both locals and holidaymakers from around the world. Led by a crack Australian team, the best forensic specialists from around the world were in a race against time to give back every victim their identity. Creating forensic history, the international team\u2019s mantra from the outset was \u2018we will take them home\u2019, a seemingly impossible ambition but one that almost succeeded. In this film forensic science intersects with powerful stories of survival and loss, attempting to make some sense out of a tragedy so bewilderingly complete that nearly a decade out it still seems far-fetched to most of us.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xTSsGEqK9CRMxytq0maCXBaP8d0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
