By the side of this tomb, lies the abandoned grave of American soldier Edmond William Quer. The inscription in his grave says that he died at the age of 22, in1946, just one year after the end of World War II. Mrs. Bertha was very intrigued by this and she used to leave a flower for the soldier every time she visited the cemetery.
