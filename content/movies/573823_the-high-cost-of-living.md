At the trial he pleads in opposition to his own lawyers. He explains that he is now too old to be of any assistance to his widowed daughter and his grand-children who are dependent on him for support. He says he prefers death to a life of poverty and wretchedness. In telling the judge and jury his pathetic story (which is shown on the screen) old Joel betrays a love for his grandchildren and his fellow laborers that is poignant with pathos.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tLx7Ww175uoyaPtV0gTPhKigO0b.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
