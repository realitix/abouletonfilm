Many of his achievements are still attributed to contemporaries Thomas Edison and Guglielmo Marconi. Tesla's surprising inventions are revealed in his autobiographical and scientific writings, supplemented by rare photographs and re-creations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j84cx1SbUjpkaWHOQqphemE1soy.jpg", "actors": ["Stacy Keach (Nikola Tesla (Voice))", "Elisabeth Noone (Narrator)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "pancine", "content": "Great documentary about a true genius, whose theories & inventions weren't profit motivated but for the betterment of mankind. Hugely ripped off by Marconi and Edison (he who denied that alternating current was the future or would even work) and also had US government backing. Many Tesla inventions are taken for granted today and wrongfully attributed to Ed. or Mar. That is shameful."}], "recommandations_id": [83006], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
