Bush and John Kerry alternate singing verses and choruses of a partisan political version of Woody Guthrie's \"This Land Is Your Land.\" Bush and Kerry trade insults (\"you're a liberal weenie,\" \"you're dumb as a doorknob\") and bragging rights (one's for tax cuts, the other has three Purple Hearts), as the animated backgrounds undercut the egos of both. Cheney, Rumsfeld, Edwards and Dean join their leaders in the choruses, and an American Indian provides counterpoint. Whose land wins out in November?
