He is being accommodated in the house of a respected family. He is working slowly because of his love for the daughter of his hosts. They resist in every possible way and pay a high price: Their daughter dies. Though in despair, the master completes the iconostasis: a masterpiece the locals perceive as a heresy. And he leaves once again without any destination.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1XmuIZ3L4Ji5JuaaL5BEqkSxjpx.jpg", "actors": ["Dimitar Tashev (Raphe Klinche)", "\u0415\u043c\u0438\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0430 (Sultana Glaoushev)", "Violeta Gindeva (Katerina Glaoushev)", "Dobrinka Stankova (Bozhanka)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
