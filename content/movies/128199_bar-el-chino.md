In Buenos Aires, a big city with a present-day lifestyle, there is a neighborhood where time has come to a standstill: Pompeya, one of the places where tango was born. Here there is a bar, a unique bar: El Chino. A group of veteran artists has kept their friendship alive throughout the years. With their songs they express a particular way of seeing and enjoying life. Solidarity and loyalty are present in the magic environment of El Chino. This special feeling is transmitted by the artists through tango, and the audience can perceive it.
