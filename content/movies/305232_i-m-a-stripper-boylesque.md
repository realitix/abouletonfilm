He's the ringmaster and snake charmer of Boylesque T.O., Canada's first all-male burlesque troupe. This talented group of dancers, actors, and performance artists has been busting their buns to put male nudity and sexuality back center-stage where it belongs. Their diversity and openness to different expressions of sexuality and body types is well renowned. A Boylesque show is guaranteed to leave you hot under the collar, howling with laughter, and screaming for more! Though his troupe is a mosaic of gay, bisexual and tri-anything - James is decidedly and (surprisingly!) straight. So just what lures a straight man into this world of wigs, sequins, and bawdy delights? Perhaps this Queen Bee likes having his own gay honey hive.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
