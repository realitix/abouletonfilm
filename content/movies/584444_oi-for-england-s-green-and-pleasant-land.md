It was then staged at The Royal Court Theatre Upstairs, directed by the late, then resident director Antonia Bird and featured Paul McGann, Robin Hayter, Dorian Healy, Peter Lovstrom, Paul Moriarty, and Beverley Martin in the cast. The play toured youth clubs and community centres across London in a bid to engage young people in the social and political issues of the day and to unite them against racism and fascism. This film replete with exclusive interviews from Griffiths, musical director Andy Roberts and guests Alan Gilbey (east end writer) and Micky Geggus (Cockney Rejects) looks back at the tour by way of a reunion of the play's original cast and crew almost 30 years later.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rG77WLAHPAA4a7uwQxggq45Wlwf.jpg", "actors": ["Robin Hayter (Himself)", "Peter Lovstrom (Himself)", "Paul McGann (Himself)", "Dorian Healy (Himself)", "Paul Moriarty (Himself)", "Trevor Griffiths (Himself)", "Micky Geggus (Himself)", "Beverly Martin (Herself)", "Andy Roberts (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
