Turner already had the following on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9: founder of a television network, owner of the Atlanta Hawks and Braves, and, most appropriate here, winner of the 1977 America\u2019s Cup. Still, he loved to sail and loved to race with his crew of carefully selected mates. This race would prove to be like no other Turner had ever entered when a freak storm turned the Celtic Sea into chaos. When the winds stopped and the race was over, many of the 303 entrants hadn\u2019t even finished and, tragically, 15 sailors had lost their lives. The victorious crew of the Tenacious relive the voyage, of which Turner famously said: \u201cI was more afraid of losing than I was of dying.\u201d", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
