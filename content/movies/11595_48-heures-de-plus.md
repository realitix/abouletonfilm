Et Iceman a mis sa t\u00eate \u00e0 prix. Pour preuve, l'autobus qui l'\u00e9loigne du p\u00e9nitencier est attaqu\u00e9 et fait dix-sept tonneaux avant de s'arr\u00eater.

That's what every convict says!\r\n\r\nThe theme tune says it all really, the boys are back in town. Nolte and Murphy are back together as cop and convict wading through a plot as lazy as it gets. Walter Hill directs once again and it's only his action scenes that stop this from being an outright stinker. \r\n\r\nEvery thing about it comes off as a cheap cash in lacking originality, with scenes even reproduced from the first film here. A strong supporting cast of character actors file in to make some easy money, with the likes of Brion James, Ed O'Ross, Brent Jennings and Kevin Tighe at least proving to be reassuring presences.\r\n\r\nMurphy and Nolte jostle, fight each other and swear a lot, which would be OK were it not already done so much better in the first film. All things considered, it's a no brainer really to suggest you watch the first film instead. 5/10"}], "recommandations_id": [150, 10136, 11066, 9085]}
