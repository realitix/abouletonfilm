However, during recent years a fresh rainbow wind has been blowing over the Chinese mainland: a pioneer generation of Chinese parents has been stepping up and speaking out on their love for their gay kids. This documentary features 6 mothers from all over China, who talk openly and freely about their experiences with their homosexual children. With their love, they are giving a whole new definition to Chinese-style family bonds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3Uih2Jmyn8iA4PtMwRXcSYAQFHP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "jFaKcCQCxKE"}
