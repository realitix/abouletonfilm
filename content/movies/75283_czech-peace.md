The players in this story are everyone from villagers to George W. Bush,  Condoleezza Rice, Barack Obama, peace activists and lobbyists representing American  arms manufacturers. Can the Mayor of Trokavec (population 80) take the US on? CZECH PEACE shows the workings of geopolitics and the way they affect the little people.  The personal clashes with the impersonal, the specifc with the universal, and an individual  with the so-called great history.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tyCgu936lzOgOyBgAOQhLnIG4Ih.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [75287], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
