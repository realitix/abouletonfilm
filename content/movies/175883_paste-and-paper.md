James Parrott, brother of Charley Chase, was an equally skilled man behind the camera, later writing and directing some of Roach's best two-reelers, before he died too young, but while the gags here are well done, he never really developed much of a personality in these pieces and they are not, somehow, quite as sharp as the stuff he was co-starring in with Sid Saylor two or three years before. The extended gag with the plank of wood seesawing is typical.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["James Parrott ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
