Santa lands on the roof, comes down the chimney, and opens his bag. The toys march out and decorate the tree, with the toy soldiers shooting balls from their cannon, a toy airplane stringing a garland like skywriting, and the toy firemen applying snow. A blimp delivers the star to the top. Meanwhile, Santa fills the stockings. His laughter awakens the children, who sneak out. The toys rush to their places, and Santa escapes up the chimney just in time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gIletohgaKWTkKxselEvdjoGfYG.jpg", "actors": ["Donald Novis (Singer)", "Kenny Baker (Singing narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [66826, 68498, 67573, 68497], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
