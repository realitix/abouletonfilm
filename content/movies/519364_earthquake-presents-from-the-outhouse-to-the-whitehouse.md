Amazing! And so is this must-have stand-up comedy show featuring a six-pack of comedians who hilariously reflect on President Barack Obamas historic election and what it means for America. Taking us from the outhouse to the White House are host Earthquake (Everybody Hates Chris), Sheryl Underwood (BETs Comic View), Joe Clair (longtime host of BETs Rap City), Don DC Curry (Next Friday), Dominique and Dez White.
