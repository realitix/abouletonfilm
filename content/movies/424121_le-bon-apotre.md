Look at the inverted cross in the name itself. It has an agenda - it's not just a movie. Do not watch it, do not let your close ones watch it either.\r\n\r\nThere are many more other good horror flicks out there who can do it without demonising religion (and not any or all religion, it specifically targets Christians)."}, {"pseudo": "Gimly", "content": "I think far too many movies that go for a similar vibe to _Apostle_ aren't willing to take that very important step into actually embracing your supernatural/fantasy/gothic elements. _Apostle_ on the other hand, goes full hog saying \"fuck that\", and in turn I'm saying \"Please sir, may I have some more.\"\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it.
