Emily Carr began painting in an era when women didn't, at an age when most people shouldn't, traveling to remote locations that few professional adventurers chose to go. Not only did she adopt the painting techniques of modernism, when such ideas were considered dangerous, Carr chronicled the extraordinary art and culture of native peoples, who were invisible to the dominant culture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iW9d6jHAleZvDpdnfl5o73QByLj.jpg", "actors": ["Emily Carr (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
