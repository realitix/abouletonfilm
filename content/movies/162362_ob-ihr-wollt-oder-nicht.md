The worried parents call the other three adult daughters into the house and they arrive one by one. For the first time in 6 years the entire family is united again. The characters are drawn as tensions rise from old conflicts and as the situation sinks in that Laura might be terminally ill. The movie eventually shifts from a lively sometimes comical beginning into the serious theme of dying and does handle this quite tactfully and moving. While the film touches on many areas surrounding death (including religion, graveyard, care, eutanasia) the main focus is on the transformation of the characters that are thrown out of their busy lifes into this situation, eventually accepting it and dealing with it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wNhEDO0MKuLJKWegcKKuKSRaWEl.jpg", "actors": ["Christiane Paul (Susa)", "Senta Berger (Dorothea)", "Katharina M.
