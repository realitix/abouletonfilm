Popeye wants to dance a waltz, pull taffy, play pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey and croquet, and bob for apples, but Olive turns up her nose at all these as Bluto sabotages them. Finally, Bluto pours quick-drying cement in the apple water and drives off with Olive. Popeye, encased in cement, rolls downhill into a vegetable shop, right next to a bin of spinach. Good thing, because Bluto's getting fresh in a very old-fashioned way. A zoot-suited Popeye stops him, and gets the girl.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
