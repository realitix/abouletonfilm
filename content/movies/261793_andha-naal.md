His neighbor Chinnaiah Pillai hears the gunshot and complains to the police.A local police inspector named Naidu and a C.I.D. officer Sivanandam (Jawar Seetharaman) investigate the case by questioning five characters: Rajan's wife Usha (Pandari Bai), Chinnaiah Pillai, Rajan's brother Pattabi, Rajan's sister-in-law Hema, and dancer Ambujam (also Rajan's Mistress). Each one recounts an incident which points to a new suspect.
