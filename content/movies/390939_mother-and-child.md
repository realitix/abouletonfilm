At the same time, the maid Anna is expecting a child, whose father, Jurgen, works in a sawmill.  When both of them lose their jobs, they fear they won\u2019t be able to feed the newborn.  Thus, they strike a deal with the Petersens, which works for both couples:  Anna and Jurgen will receive a farm from the Petersens, free and clear; and the two will allow the Petersens to adopt the child.  Anna and Jurgen marry and are quite happy; but when the child is finally born, Anna doesn\u2019t wish to surrender him and flees with the child into the Wattenmeer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tZSH9cV7XteWW2xGJ2ve6kIbaJT.jpg", "actors": ["Henny Porten (Anna)", "Hansi Arnstaedt (Frau Kr\u00f6ger)", "Fita Benkhoff (Frau Hellinger)", "Paul Westermeier (Larsen, Tischlermeister)", "Hermann Picha (Rippe)", "Peter Vo\u00df (J\u00fcrgen)", "Wolfgang Keppler (Herr Petersen)", "Elisabeth Wendt (Frau Petersen)", "Werner Pledath (Dr.Fiedler)", "Paul Westermeier (Larsen)", "Luise Morland (Frau Larsen)", "Walter Steinbeck (Herr Hellinger)", "Bruno Ziener (Diener)", "Gustav P\u00fcttjer ()", "Ernst Rotmund ()", "Marina von Ditmar ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
