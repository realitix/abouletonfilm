A local politician, William Poyner, is desperate for cash and thinks marriage to Dorothea will save him. Dorothea hires Lawrence Hayes, a rough but handsome Argonaut, to bribe Fraser with jewels and to marry Rose; Hayes desperately loves Dorothea and may marry Rose to stay close to her. But Dorothea has a lover, the ravishing Anne Cooper, who encourages the match with Poyser to give the lovers cover. Are these remedies, each desperate in its turn, going to make anyone happy?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5FttznBzzFOls5SRdYfqQXrzEx.jpg", "actors": ["Jennifer Ward-Lealand (Dorothea Brook)", "Kevin Smith (Lawrence Hayes)", "Lisa Chappell (Anne Cooper)", "Cliff Curtis (Fraser)", "Michael Hurst (Willam Poyser)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "BNYpNg66Hz8"}
