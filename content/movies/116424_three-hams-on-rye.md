They quickly get on the bad side of the producer. First they fail to prevent a famous critic from sneaking into the audience. Then Shemp accidentally adds a pot holder into a cake they bake as a prop. During the play the stooges (as southern gentlemen) and the rest of the cast spit up feathers during what was supposed to be a serious scene. The critic thinks it's a hilarious satire and the boys are redeemed.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1YXgbcSvHa03N0QVA6GODvCjfUc.jpg", "actors": ["Shemp Howard (Shemp)", "Larry Fine (Larry)", "Moe Howard (Moe)", "Nanette Bordeaux (Lulabelle)", "Christine McIntyre (Janiebelle)", "Emil Sitka (B.K.
