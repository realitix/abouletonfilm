The story centers on a talented young fighter, a logger that Abel Ginoux and his Italian partner Zipolino, a crooked doctor, discover during a fight in a woodland town. The logger, Passe Partout, is in a fight with Ginoux's best fighter and ends up accidentally killing the pugilist. Ever the opportunist, Ginoux lures Partout into the ring to replace the late fighter. Partout proves to be the classic provincial innocent with high, rugged ideals and little knowledge about the modern world. Ginoux takes him to town for the first time and the logger is delighted to discover amenities such as electricity and silent films. He soon falls in love with the beauteous Camille who works in her late father's cafe with her mother. Her father made many of the films, most of which are boxing matches, because he believed that the presence of a camera rendered a fight unfixable.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jM4XWOP05MkXMexDPTpizvbgZJ3.jpg", "actors": ["Karl Makinen ()", "Riccardo Cucciolla ()", "C\u00e9cile Bois ()", "Andr\u00e9a Ferr\u00e9ol ()", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Vincent ()", "Alexandra Vandernoot ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
