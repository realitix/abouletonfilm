Every song is inspired, in a class of its own, whether the real version of \"I Shot the Sheriff,\" the hymnlike \"No Woman, No Cry,\" or the sheer joy of \"Jamming.\" Even allowing that Marley never wrote any bad material, then Legend is still the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me, the heart and soul of the Jamaican people packed into one five-inch compact disc. He was unique, and the message of this record, more than any other, is that he died far too soon.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fuJX83GaAFKo6E8TJo0M42fcfFR.jpg", "actors": ["Bob Marley (Bob Marley)", "Peter Tosh (S\u00e4nger)", "Bunny Wailer (Schlagzeuger)", "Junior Braithwaite (S\u00e4nger)", "Beverley Kelso (Background Vocal)", "Cherry Smith (Background Vocal)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
