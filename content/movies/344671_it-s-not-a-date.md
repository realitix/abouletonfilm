Although \"It's not a date\" but more of a casual meet at a local club; it begins as a classic girl meets boy saga with casual conversation that escalates to a night of passion. It evolves, NOT into a romantic partnership or a parting nod, to \"bad chemistry\" but instead with Carly. Frustrated with a life full of bad dates and believing that Milo is the worse of them she takes Milo on a detour into insanity so extreme he wishes \"It's not a date.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z97DS80onSDWTFdNzppcklTmCxi.jpg", "actors": ["Leah Huebner (Carly Sagat)", "Mischa Pollack (Milo Dailey)", "Eric Roberts (Bill Sagat)", "Eliza Roberts (Laurie Sagat)", "Nina Hartley (Aunt Cindy)", "Mari Cielo Pajares (Sofia)", "Cortney Palm (Tammy)", "Heather Sims (Hillary)", "Raymond Morris (Detrick)", "Elaine Partnow (Nana)", "Alison Korman (Ruth)", "Sheila Hart (Mindy)", "Mai Linh (Dream Girl #1)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
