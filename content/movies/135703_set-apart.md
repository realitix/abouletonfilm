Korina, Rey, Anthony, and Marcus all grew up on the streets. Every decision they make in that volatile environment could affect the rest of their lives. Pastor John Gunn (John Schneider) runs the Power Company Kids' ministry, an organization dedicated to giving at-risk kids the tools they need to build brighter futures. He's convinced that the four teens would benefit from going back to the basics and experiencing the cowboy lifestyle, and with a little help from ranch owners Randy and Heidi Gunn, Pastor Gunn shows the kids that there's much more to life than hustling on the streets. Though reluctant to participate at first, the kids quickly adjust to their new surroundings as their eyes are opened to a whole new world of opportunity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x6HTaYOKhMFH19MmciFPh0EbAD5.jpg", "actors": ["Ary Katz (Marcus Brown)", "Richard Roundtree (J.T.)", "John Schneider (Pastor John Gunn)", "Raymond J.
