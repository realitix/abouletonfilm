Saving up for classes while she works part time in a manga store, she lives with her older, gambler brother (Ryuhei Matsuda) after her father's death. When the mother (Kimiko Yo) she never knew turns up out of nowhere and moves in, it only causes irritation for the aspiring otaku. But when her mother just as quickly disappears, it leaves Mugiko (or \"Sweet Pea\") searching for answers, bringing her back to her mother's hometown to discover what happened to her mother's own dream.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pj1DPTQioxn6LJuSGqqYbo1Tjdi.jpg", "actors": ["Maki Horikita (Mugiko Koiwa)", "Ryuhei Matsuda (Norio Koiwa)", "Kimiko Yo (Ayako Akaike)", "Youichi Nukumizu (Manabu Inomoto)", "Yumi Asou (Michiru)", "Taka Guadalcanal (Haruo Aso)", "Eri Fuse (Natsue Aso)", "Amane Okayama (Senzo Aso)", "Sayaka Tashiro (Co-worker)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [378114, 88797, 459592, 25746], "youtube_key": "G8SEHCf9YNQ"}
