Our normal paths and expectations come to a halt. Suffering forces us to take a new path, to create new expectations. In Drops Like Stars, Bell shows us how art does the same thing; it disrupts us, forces us to see the world differently and to forge new expectations. How will we re-imagine suffering when we realize that God sees our lives as works of art?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Rob Bell ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
