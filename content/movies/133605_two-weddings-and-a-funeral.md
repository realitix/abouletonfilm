This is his feature debut as a director and producer. A queer movie that delivers the goods\u2014humorous and touching\u2014and fulfills the director\u2019s wish for a more \u201copen\u201d society. A story of two people that masquerade as a couple to hide their homosexuality and keep their real loves intact. Minsoo, who is gay and wants to escape from his meddling parents, and Hyojin, who is a lesbian and wants to adopt a baby, are both doctors working at the same hospital. To fulfill their wishes, they decide to fake their nuptials. Their marriage is surrounded by episodes, some are humorous and others full of pathos. Unlike other films dealing with similar subject matter, focusing on the darker side of the spectrum, the director\u2019s choice to keep things lighter and brighter is also a virtue.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/21R7T1ToTbF501D2Y0LoyQGsSZt.jpg", "actors": ["Choi Il-hwa (Min-soo's father)", "Ryu Hyun-kyung (Hyo-jin)", "Jung Ae-yeon (Seo-young)", "Lee Seung-joon (Kyeong-nam)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [303680], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
