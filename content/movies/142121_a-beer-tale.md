Orphaned at the age of five, the brothers inherited their family brewery and were left in the care of their uncle, a well-meaning but less than ideal paternal figure. Raised on beer, with the assumption they're all grown up, Luke and Corey decide it's time to finish their family beer; a beer their parents started but were never able to finish twenty years ago. But when the idealistic Luke meets a girl whose family shows him the home life he's always wanted, he abandons Corey and their family beer in pursuit of this budding relationship. Corey, however, refuses to go down without a fight, and the ensuing mayhem that follows pits brother against brother and forces the Colorado wild boys to finally grow up and decide what kind of men they really want to be.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sW55PYNr0nnpMo8xRRoWijRuEK5.jpg", "actors": ["Lee Roy Kunz (Corey Frankenstein)", "Cru Ennis (Luke Frankenstein)", "Scott Patterson (George)", "Alexandra Paul (Laurie)", "Todd Leigh (Derek)", "Zelda Williams (Kelly)", "Taryn Southern (Joy)", "Max Barsness (Ray)", "Ben Begley (Sitcom Character #1)", "Luba Bocian (Russian Girl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
