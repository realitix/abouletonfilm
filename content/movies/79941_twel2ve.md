In a time where technology and the energy of our planet are accelerating off the charts and Mother Nature's confusion can no longer be explained away by experts. The Kootenay, Purcell, Selkirk, Monashee, Pacific Coast, Cascade, Wasatch, Uinta, Cache, Gros Ventre, Strandafjellet and Ka\u00e7kar mountain ranges were on the winning end of the spectrum, and you might guess where the Absinthe crew spent their winter. Twelve riders having a blast, redefining the limits of what is possible. Absinthe brings you the next wintry shred classic: Twel2ve.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hH3zHK8Zy3eK7JapexooFAMKdnM.jpg", "actors": ["Bode Merrill (Himself)", "Gigi R\u00fcf (Himself)", "Sylvain Bourbousson (Himself)", "Dan Brisse (Himself)", "Johnnie Paxson (Himself)", "JP Solberg (Himself)", "Mat Schaer (Himself)", "Annie Boulanger (Herself)", "Lucas Debari (Himself)", "Wolfgang Nyvelt (Himself)", "Romain deMarchi (Himself)", "Nicolas M\u00fcller (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "M0FfwOupElA"}
