However, a new kid comes to town determined to force him back into racing so he can take his title--and he's already taken his girlfriend.When his younger brother, Steve, is killed racing a hot-rod, Jeff Northup blames himself for the accident since he had built the car for his brother and had encouraged him to race it, with other boys on a special course provided by police detective Ben Merrill, who is working to reduce the city's hot-rod fatalities by providing supervision for the dangerous hobby. Jeff withdraws from participating in races on Merrill's course and, without his leadership, reverts to racing on the streets. \"Bronc\" Talbott, a newcomer, makes a play for Jeff's girlfriend, Lisa Vernon. Eventually, the taunting-Talbott forces Jeff into a race which results in the death of a bicycling child, and evidence seems to indicate Jeff was at fault.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zQG8RZtbpdxJiS0vLcvt9eBOmgg.jpg", "actors": ["Lori Nelson (Lisa Vernon)", "Chuck Connors (Detective Ben Merrill)", "John Smith (Jeff Northrup)", "Mark Andrews (Bronc Talbott)", "Roxanne Arlen (L.P.)", "Frank Gorshin (Flat Top)", "Fred Essler (Yo-Yo)", "Eddie Ryder (Two Tanks)", "Carolyn Kearney (Judy)", "Del Erickson (Steve Northrup)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
