It stars Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, Louis Jordan, Rod Taylor, Maggie Smith, Orson Welles, Elsda Martinelli and Margaret Rutherford. Filmed in Panavision and Metrocolor, music is by Miklos Rozsa and cinematography by Jack Hildyard.\r\n\r\nTerminal 2, London Heathrow Airport, and fog has grounded the flights of some very important people. Time, then, for truths to out and futures resolved...\r\n\r\nCheque book generosity.\r\n\r\nDisliked by critics upon release but a hit at the box office, The V.I.P.s is a throwback to the days when ensemble star power could carry a melodrama through to its conclusion. The performances of the actors, playing well to do characters facing up to some tribulations in life, are most enjoyable (nice to see Rod Taylor actually being Australian, Smith owning the film and Rutherford being Rutherford) and even though there's some silly moments within Rattigan's screenplay, there's enough quality drama and warmth to make the near two hour running time bearable. Besisdes, I never thought the sight of Richard Burton signing a cheque could make me feel so happy! 7/10"}], "recommandations_id": [118915, 94917, 151307, 106224]}
