The film is about the singing and acting career of Tally Brown, a classically trained opera and blues singer who was a star of underground films in New York City and a denizen of its underworld in the late 1960s.  In this documentary, Praunheim relies on extensive interviews with Brown, as she recounts her collaboration with Andy Warhol, Taylor Mead and others, as well as her friendships with Holly Woodlawn, and Divine. Brown opens the film with a cover of David Bowie's \"Heroes\" and concludes with \"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide.\" The film captures not only Tally Brown\u2019s career but also a particular New York milieu in the 1970s.
