Protests, began in England and soon spread to the rest of the Islamic world, culminating in February 1989 with Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini issuing a fatwa - a death sentence on the writer.  Now, 30 years on, Mobeen Azhar embarks on a journey to examine the lasting effect the book has had on the Muslim community, and continue to have an impact today. Mobeen hears from a range of people affected by the so called 'Rushdie Affair' - from the men who took an early stand against the book; to a writer who wrestled with the book's publication, complex questions of free speech, and her own religious beliefs; and a former member of the National Front who claims that the furor over the book became a recruiting tool for them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uHGzKHgVCmGGkUpSZv5gyKHqRgb.jpg", "actors": ["Mobeen Azhar (Himself - Reporter)", "Sadia Hameed (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Ten-OKwBHEM"}
