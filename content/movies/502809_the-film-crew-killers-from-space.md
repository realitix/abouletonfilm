It isn\u2019t a very good plan, but they\u2019re not very competent aliens, hobbled by having to wear hooded onesies and ping pong ball-halves over their eyes. Will he save the world? Of course he will, we\u2019re still here, aren\u2019t we?  And thanks to the Film Crew, we learn all about that legendary film acting technique called the Robechet - a \u201csudden, expressionless, dead-eyed closeup\u201d used lavishly in Killers From Space. It\u2019s so fun and easy to do, soon you\u2019ll be pulling Robechets on all your friends, who in turn will despise you! Try one today!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ePTtOZGbpjgBoNfAvZNNVW5z28B.jpg", "actors": ["Michael J.
