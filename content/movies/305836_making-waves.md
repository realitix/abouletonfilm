Life smiles upon Cella. Happily divorced, having two children and a successful job as a presenter at a local station, for which she interviews people every morning who take the ferry across the IJ river. In her enthusiasm, Cella resembles her mother, once a celebrated violinist, but the similarity also causes friction between the two women. Just when Cella meets a new love, her father's sudden death puts her life on a different track. Johanna increasingly muddles past and present and brings back fragments of memories that point to a painful secret she carries on her back. Cella tries to dig up the truth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eiurxYMyhAYEJqqCxqZbvNJpSq9.jpg", "actors": ["Jacqueline Blom ()", "Kitty Courbois ()", "Jaap Maarleveld ()", "Isis Cabolet ()", "Koen Wouterse ()", "Ruben L\u00fcrsen ()", "Lottie Hellingman ()", "Hayo Bruins ()", "Rick David ()", "Arjan Seykens ()", "Leny Breederveld ()", "Filip Bolluyt ()", "Marisa Van Eyle ()", "Urmie Plein ()", "Anouk van Schaik ()", "Sophie Hoebrechts ()", "Wouter Severijn ()", "Ottolien Boeschoten ()", "Marjan Lammers ()", "Huub van der Lubbe ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
