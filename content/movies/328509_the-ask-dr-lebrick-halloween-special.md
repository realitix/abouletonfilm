We already know the risk we are taking in this hilarious puppet comedy, because the only people who would bother to watch are cool people with the same sense of humor as us. And in truth, isn't that scary to the conforming majority society, we think so and that's why it's fun and funny.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
