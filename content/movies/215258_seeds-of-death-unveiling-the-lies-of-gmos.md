Genetic Engineering of plants has been shown through scientific study disruptive to  entire cellular mechanisms of plants, animals and humans, along with severe negative  impact on the environment.  The Big Ag companies; Monsanto, DuPont, Syngenta--are dead set that the world's  populations remain in the dark, ignorant about the devastating health and environmental  risks, and argue their manipulation of genes is safe, yet increasing study shows the opposite.  To counter the lies, another award winning documentary hits back with the truth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sdDQoWmjg0HZ7eukjt8UWj7n4Ap.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
