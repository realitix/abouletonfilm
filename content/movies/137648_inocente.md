At 15, Inocente refuses to let her dream of becoming an artist be caged by being an undocumented immigrant forced to live homeless for the last nine years. Color is her personal revolution and its sweep on her canvases creates a world that looks nothing like her own dark past. INOCENTE is both a timeless story about the transformative power of art and a timely snapshot of the new face of homelessness in America: children. The challenges are staggering, but the hope in her story proves that the hand she has been dealt does not define her, her dreams do.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uvmMAw20vkiym554LAf2sU2PyXF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
