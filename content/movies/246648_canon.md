The first sequence is a simple demonstration of the canon \"Frere Jacques\" where four cubes dance and combine with one another on a checkerboard. The second sequence show four little human-like figures dancing in space. The third and most elaborate sequence shows a human going through several strange gesticulations. Through multiple printing we realize that the man, as in the previous sequences, is part of a visual canon and is making the gestures to himself. As we hear variations on the canonic theme so too do we witness visual variations: a woman and cat enters the canon. To show the musical technique of inversion, the image of the man is printed upside down.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tVak6LU9iBSl3v0B1mcPYAtjQoQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [256581, 90040, 234467, 162755], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
