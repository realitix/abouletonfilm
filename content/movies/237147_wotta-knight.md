Of course, Bluto plays dirty, squirting grease on the field in front of Popeye's horse, and using an extra-long lance. But Popeye wins anyhow, and climbs SB's tower with Bluto right behind him. They fight over her, playing tug-of-war with her pigtails.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7AimzTnHSQ4e1mVYJuAHsI1GVWx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
