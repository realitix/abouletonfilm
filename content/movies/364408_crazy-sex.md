He combined these two loves in this two-part examination of lust. The first story features an elderly jeweler's adventures with his unsatisfied wife, a handsome neighbor, and the neighborhood bordello. The second is a more modern tale of sex, lies, and videotape.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xV3bAhrO1IGroIlGPkYXP0MPSAl.jpg", "actors": ["Shirley Yu Sha-Li (Louise Li)", "Lily Li Li-Li (Ling Ling)", "Chen Ping (Big Brother's Wife)", "Wang Hsieh (Big Boss)", "Chan Shen (One of Big Boss' men)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
