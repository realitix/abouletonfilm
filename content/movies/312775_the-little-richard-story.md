Richard was then lured back to secular music in the 1960s and 70s, but the excesses of stardom led him to a second retreat from the stage. For years he struggled to reconcile his religious calling with his flamboyant rock-and-roll persona, and at the time of filming, Klein finds Little Richard selling \u2018Black Heritage Bibles\u2019 for a Nashville couple. Sensing that his image is being exploited, Richard quits his sales position and deserts the film. But Klein turns this into an opportunity to reconstruct Richard\u2019s personality through the words of his family and friends in his native Macon, Georgia, and to celebrate his status as a cultural icon by filming scores of Little Richard impersonators and adoring fans in Hollywood.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3nhthmtFCgJUJI93n0PdK6jkOX1.jpg", "actors": ["Little Richard (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
