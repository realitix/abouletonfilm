In his small pub in the northern English town of Oldham, Harry (David Morrissey \u2013 The Walking Dead, State of Play) is something of a local celebrity. But what's the second-best hangman in England to do on the day they've abolished hanging?  Amongst the cub reporters and pub regulars dying to hear Harry\u2019s reaction to the news, his old assistant Syd (Andy Nyman \u2013 Peaky Blinders, Death at a Funeral) and the peculiar Mooney (Johnny Flynn \u2013 Clouds of Sils Maria) lurk with very different motives for their visit.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l60KlZocJrDtZ9pcHRRgvjnHxeb.jpg", "actors": ["David Morrissey (Harry)", "Johnny Flynn (Mooney)", "Andy Nyman (Syd)", "Bronwyn James (Shirley)", "Sally Rogers (Alice)", "Craig Parkinson (Inspector Fry)", "Ryan Pope (Charlie)", "Simon Rouse (Arthur)", "Tony Hirst (Bill)", "James Dryden (Clegg)", "John Hodgkinson (Albert)", "Josef Davies (Hennessy)", "Mark Rose (Guard)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
