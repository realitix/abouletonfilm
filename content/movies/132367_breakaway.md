A prototype for the best (but still, lesser) contemporary formalist music videos, like Peter Care\u2019s \u201cWhat\u2019s the Frequency, Kenneth?\u201d and \u201cDrive\u201d (both for REM), Conner\u2019s movie is an experiment in the visual language of film. But no matter how powerful a formal analysis of his filmmaking process may be in suggesting how Conner\u2019s rhythms affect us, there is much in Breakaway \u2013 in Basilotta\u2019s brash and unbridled self-assertiveness, in Conner\u2019s feverish camera style, and even in the uncomplicated honesty of Cobb\u2019s catchy lyrics and tune \u2013 that defies verbalisation\u2026 and must simply be loved! -- Senses of Cinema", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a9N4PeVW8FrdLnkKQ0pLNa4UVV9.jpg", "actors": ["Toni Basil (Dancer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [130851, 253541, 151085, 143521], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
