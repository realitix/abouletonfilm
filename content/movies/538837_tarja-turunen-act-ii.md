The theatrical rock adventure 'Act II' combines two incredible, yet slightly different live performances on video: The first chapter, 'Metropolis Alive', has been filmed two months prior to the release of Tarja's 2016 success The Shadow Self . 20 winners from all over Europe were lucky to witness Tarja's intimate, yet rocking 75 minute set at renowned Metropolis Studios in London, UK where the singer performed songs from her then unreleased album for the first time in front of an audience.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ddk2ofz174g1WvpcAJdJdvVQp1F.jpg", "actors": ["Tarja Turunen (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "xqcpUm5wuB4"}
