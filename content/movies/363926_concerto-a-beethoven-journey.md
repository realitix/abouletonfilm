Considered one of the top pianists of the age, Leif Ove Andsnes offers rare insights into the mind of a world-class pianist and access to his personal and professional life. Against the wonderful background of Leif Ove Andsnes playing these five pieces, we also peel back the many myths of Beethoven's life. Perhaps above all it is the fresh new biography of Beethoven that is most revealing.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gzrg01eNeJpjbLA9ZHYDa1tKC9B.jpg", "actors": ["Leif Ove Andsnes (Self/Performer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "6u4hdY3ATRk"}
