Grey (Chloe Sevigny) is married and living in a home that is bathed in beauty and warmth. But, she is imprisoned by her own isolation. Los Angeles reinforces and adds to her stagnation, but the inability to connect lives inside of her. Her isolation is such that she can only open up to her husband when they are separated by a telephone. The reveal of this short vignette is that her husband has been right outside, on the other side of the wall, the whole time and she knows it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6LGFiC4V3MjzWFgjYSBRyXWYH4Y.jpg", "actors": ["Chlo\u00eb Sevigny ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
