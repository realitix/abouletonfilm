This video deals with Carri\u00f3n's attempt to put together the film festival: Lilia Prado Superstar Film Festival; his search for films in Mexico and his efforts to convince Lilia Prado to attend. Whilst this video has the appearance of a documentary, the apparent \"truthfulness\" of this genre is turned on its head: Carri\u00f3n has substituted all his Mexican contacts for his Dutch friends and nearly all the conversations take place in English.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
