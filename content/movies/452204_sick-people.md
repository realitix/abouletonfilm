The zany antics include the misadventures of a voyeuristic nurse, an exhibitionistic patient, a doctor and nurse who engage in S&M, a hypochondriac, and a lesbian nurse who sleeps with the patients.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zHx5a4nJAEQdgkaGO54aDTpK460.jpg", "actors": ["Yuri Ishihara ()", "Setsuhiko Kobayashi ()", "Kyoko Irohani ()", "K\u00f4ichi Imaizumi ()", "Makoto Sugimoto ()", "Ky\u00f4ko Nakamura ()", "Ken'ichi Kanbe ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
