With his spiky yellow hair, wrap-around shades and pale mask of a face, Richio would seem to be an icy moon circling the distant planet of his own regard.  But as Okuhara shows us from the first scene, Richio has been traumatized by a boyhood horror - and still bears the physical scars on one eye, the emotional scars in dreams and visions he can neither escape nor explain away. The sunglasses and mask are there for a reason, the pain and rage are real. At the same time, he has a straightforwardness that verges on the cruel - but this is also one of his most appealing qualities.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a5VUpPwLpJtOwkme8Tnbzm7FtQx.jpg", "actors": ["Arata Iura (Richio)", "Aoi Miyazaki (Konomi Saeki)", "Kumiko Aso (Akemi Saeki)", "Tomoro Taguchi ()", "Tomono Kuga ()", "Ryouhei Kunieda ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
