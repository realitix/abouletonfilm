Here the comic book noir characters and L.A. landscape of Ichor re-emerge. In the film's final section, as representation is replaced by the abstraction of silence and pure color flicker, Saturn disappears, and the film transforms into a color diary.\" --Lewis Klahr", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
