Set in the backyard of a blue collar South Philadelphia neighborhood early in the summer of 1973, the comedy-drama focuses on the 21st birthday celebration of Harvard student Francis Geminiani. In attendance are his divorced blue collar father Fran and Fran's widowed girlfriend Lucille, next-door neighbor Bunny Weinberger and her overweight son Herschel, and Francis' classmates, the wealthy WASP Hastings siblings; Judith (who seeks romance with Francis) and Randy (the object of Francis' unexpressed affection), who have arrived unexpectedly, much to their friend's dismay. All are dysfunctional to varying degrees, and the interactions among them provide the play with its comic and dramatic moments.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Danny Aiello (Fran Geminiani)", "Scott Baio (Francis Geminiani)", "Anne De Salvo (Lucille Pompi)", "John Cassisi (Herschel Weinberger)", "Sheree North (Bunny Weinberger)", "Eve Gordon (Judith Hastings)", "Eric Schiff (Randy Hastings)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
