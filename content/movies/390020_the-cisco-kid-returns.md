Duncan Renaldo, actually Rumanian, starred as the Mexican \"Robin Hood of the Old West\", with Martin Garralaga as his corpulent sidekick Pancho. In the tradition of 20th Century-Fox's earlier \"Cisco\" efforts, our hero comes to the aid of an orphaned child, clears himself of a kidnapping charge, and proves that a \"solid citizen\" is in fact a criminal mastermind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cSO3FpenXuhpeP2kURMfCA3udCM.jpg", "actors": ["Duncan Renaldo (Cisco Kid)", "Mart\u00edn Garralaga (Pancho Gonzales)", "Roger Pryor (John Harris)", "Cecilia Callejo (Rosita Gonzales)", "Fritz Leiber (The Padre)", "Jan Wiley (Jeanette)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
