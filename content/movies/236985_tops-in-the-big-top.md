Bluto covets Popeye's assistant Olive. Popeye sticks his head in a lion's mouth, but Bluto has put a steak on Popeye's head. When he gets out of that, he does his high wire act: carrying a piano, and Olive, blindfolded. Bluto sabotages this with a banana peel and tosses Popeye to the monkey cage, while he has his way with Olive - until Popeye eats his spinach.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qReliuNatuErrSJYcWlKkZtqI4y.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
