After the factory goes bankrupt and closes, the filmmaker accompanies some of its employees as they continue to make their way, questioning them about their daily routines, the circumstances in which they live, about looking for work or the new jobs they find. One woman\u2019s situation is precarious, but that doesn\u2019t prevent her from bringing up her grandchildren. Another woman works here and there, flexible and resourceful. One man blossoms visibly in his newly unemployed state. Bit by bit, different aspects of their private lives and personal misfortunes emerge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/97ZTemyxDiTAP8naqZfmtFfPFFk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
