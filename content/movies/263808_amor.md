The recurring sounds of cutting cloth, hands clapping, hammering, and tapping underline the associations of the montage of short camera movements, which bring together the making of a suit, the restoration of a building, and details of a figure, presumably Beavers himself, standing in the natural theatre in a new suit, making a series of hand movements and gestures. A handsomely designed Italian banknote suggests the aesthetic economy of the film: the tailoring, trimming, and chiseling point to the editing of the film itself.\u201d (P. Adams Sitney).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eRzSkhJfFmRkYK5q1zVM170GZql.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
