Alicia, a culture instructor, is sent to a small town \"Maravillas\", which is itself an exaggerated, but very ingenious reflection of the real Cuba. The adventures that she has there are almost as crazy and senseless as the ones lived by the other Alice (in Wonderland), reflecting the indoctrination, coercion, absolutims, and many other everyday problems in Cuban society.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2g5G9AEGPOXVoWynRykvibmsHBy.jpg", "actors": ["Thais Vald\u00e9s (Alicia Diaz)", "Carlos Cruz  (Perez)", "Vanessa Carballido (A little girl)", "Idalmis Del Risco (The Woman in Red)", "Ulises Toirac (El Maestro)", "Judith Rodr\u00edguez (A little girl)", "Jeny Valdes (A little girl)", "Yaima Vego (A little girl)", "Jorge Losada ()", "Argentina Estevez ()", "Jorge Mart\u00ednez ()", "Pedro Mart\u00ednez ()", "Reynaldo Miravalles ()", "Enrique Molina ()", "Ra\u00fal Pomares ()", "Alberto Pujol ()", "Nieves Riovalles ()", "Alina Rodr\u00edguez ()", "Parmenia Silva ()", "Jorge Luis S\u00e1nchez ()", "Elvira Valdes ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
