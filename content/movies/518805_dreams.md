Should he stick with his small time gangster friends and make some cash, or listen to Zeko in the fast food stall who thinks you should go to school forever? Right now he is satisfied drinking beer and hitting on girls. But when his mom gets really sick and has to go to the hospital he has to make a choice. She wants to go back to her homeland Croatia one last time. She has even saved up the money. It's waiting for Goran in a plastic bag under her pillow. It's time to make the decision that will change his life forever.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3sTrPBTBugq9GVpd75Od59w6wYa.jpg", "actors": ["Filip Benko (Goran)", "Jelena Mila (Marija)", "Georgi Staykov (Zeko)", "Nick Wolf (Nick)", "My Lestander (Linnea)", "Hanna Alstr\u00f6m (Nurse)", "Peter Eggers (Markus)", "Thomas Oredsson (Doctor)", "Bahar Pars (Nurse)", "Fyr Thorvald Str\u00f6mberg (Tomas)", "Ivica Zubak (Pizza boss)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "YaV-FFdVciw"}
