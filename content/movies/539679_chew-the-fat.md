In the film project 'Chew The Fat', the artist Rirkrit Tiravanija, living in New York portraits a group of 12 artists (Douglas Gordon, Angela Bulloch, Pierre Huyghe, Philippe Parreno, Dominique Gonzalez - Foerster, Elizabeth Peyton, Tobias Rehberger, Carsten Hoeller, Liam Gillick, Jorge Pardo, Andrea Zittel, Maurizio Cattelan). The artists, all chosen by Tiravanija, belong to the same generation as himself and, like him, have advanced during the nineties to achieve international success. Most importantly, all are good friends of Tiravanija. This creates a particularly relaxed situation in which conversation can flow naturally between the two with personal issues coming up as easily and often as those to do with work or career.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3j6ToNExJDHZSnOl2dwaZOK8os.jpg", "actors": ["Angela Bulloch ()", "Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster ()", "Philippe Parreno ()", "Liam Gillick ()", "Carsten H\u00f6ller ()", "Douglas Gordon ()", "Pierre Huyghe ()", "Jorge Pardo ()", "Tobias Rehberger ()", "Andrea Zittel ()", "Elizabeth Peyton ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
