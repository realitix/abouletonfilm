The film is based on 'the life and dreams' of Nini Sardlishvili, a sixteen-year-old Georgian girl. Nini tells about her life and dreams, speaks with two elderly women about past and future and walks among the ruins of a huge, burnt-out Soviet archive. She plays herself in the film, just like the other protagonist, Domestic Intelligence agent Gocha Ovashvili. He travels across the country in response to a remarkable appeal by a Georgian minister (appearing in a newscast), to ask people if they are criminals. During this futile and absurd quest, he meets mainly aged Georgians, including a shepherd and two monks, and admires the scenery.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Nini Sardlishvili ()", "Gocha Ovashvili ()", "Vako Karchkadze ()", "Dodo Chichinadze ()", "Lara Kokaeva ()", "David Khumsishvili ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
