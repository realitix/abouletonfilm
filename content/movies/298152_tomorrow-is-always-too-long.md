Through musical numbers, animation and a uniquely Glaswegian cable TV station, the film conjures up a distinctive vision of a city. Collins met people in maternity hospitals, schools, community groups and social clubs for the elderly, asking them to sing songs, make predictions for the future, debate the status of freedom in today\u2019s society, guide us through the city\u2019s most famous prison and dance like there\u2019s no tomorrow. With animation by Matthew Robins, stellar songs from Welsh singer-songwriter Cate Le Bon, soundtrack contributions from Mogwai\u2019s Barry Burns, local voodoo ravers Golden Teacher and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, Tomorrow Is Always Too Long will take you on a trip deep into the heart of the city and beyond.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cxkb7RDi1zSyiz0BkO6t3jmN9iW.jpg", "actors": ["Mick Harden ()", "Kate Dickie ()", "Molly Christie ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
