The two films made for Biograph were A Natural Born Gambler (1916) and Fish (1916).  Bert lives in a rustic-looking cottage with his parents and two much younger brothers. The three sons have been ordered to chop wood, but Bert would rather shirk his chores and go fishing. When his father orders him to take kindling to the stove, Bert sighs and wearily totes a couple of tiny sticks while his kid brothers carry large stumps. As soon as he can manage to escape Bert does so, and happily fishes at a nearby stream. Almost immediately he catches a large fish, and decides to head for a more affluent neighborhood to sell his catch to anyone willing to buy it.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Bert Williams ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
