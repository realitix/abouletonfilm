This engaging, optimistic documentary tracks a unique development project: a shiny new beauty school, funded in part by beauty-industry mainstays, which sets out to teach the latest cutting, coloring, and perming techniques to practicing and aspiring Afghan hairdressers and beauticians. The American teachers, all volunteers, include three Afghan-Americans returning home for the first time in over twenty years. The Beauty Academy of Kabul offers a rare glimpse into Afghan women\u2019s lives, and documents the poignant and often humorous process through which women with very different experiences of life come to learn about one another.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/exhtGmDvVLf7rxeIKyhlRhdnIpv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
