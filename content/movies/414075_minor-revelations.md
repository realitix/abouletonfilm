This emotion reflects what is around me, not everyone is able to recognise it -- that is the risk I take. I think that this is good enough reason to make a film that will make visible small yet revealing things in differeent ways. I believe in tropisms and that is what interests me in this film.\" -- Marie Vermillard [taken from London Film Festival 2006 catalogue]", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8MLr05VSh7T3VlzPJG7m4cepOyO.jpg", "actors": ["Maryline Canto ()", "Antoine Chappey ()", "Simon Abkarian ()", "Hiam Abass ()", "Genevi\u00e8ve Tenne ()", "Zinedine Soualem ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
