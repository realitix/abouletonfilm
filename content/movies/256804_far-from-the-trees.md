Like that earlier film, it is a kind of impressionistic travelogue that shows a Spain far from the beaten paths of the tourist resorts; not only poverty but the persistence of superstitions and occult beliefs captured by the film rebuke the image of a forward-looking, modern Spain that by the 60s was being promoted by the Franco regime. Esteva Grewe largely allows the images and juxtapositions to speak for themselves, giving the film a lyrical feeling that somewhat softens its social criticism - though obviously not enough for the censors.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fB76fnbtq28vSNy7ljtJHIZQ31S.jpg", "actors": ["Antonio Borrero 'Chamaco' ()", "Antonio Gades ()", "Manuel Ca\u00f1o ((voice))", "Marta Mej\u00edas ((voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
