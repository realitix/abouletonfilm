Incorporating footage from John and Yoko's original film Imagine (clips of which were previously included in the 1988 documentary Imagine: John Lennon), Gimme Some Truth presents Lennon, Ono, coproducer Phil Spector, and a host of gifted musicians in a fluid context of conflict, community, and craftsmanship. Bearing witness to every stage of the recording process, this 63-minute documentary succeeds as a visual diary, a study of familiar music in its infancy, and a revealing portrait of the then-30-year-old Lennon--from witty clown to confrontational perfectionist--at the peak of his post-Fab Four inspiration.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5kiJUXJFxc9aGxP58nga4z5htx3.jpg", "actors": ["John Lennon (Himself)", "Yoko Ono (Herself)", "George Harrison (Himself)", "Phil Spector (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
