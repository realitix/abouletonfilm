Very quickly the unerring ability of ropes to loop themselves around tree roots, stopping Al from plummeting to his death or an explosion to drop him on a bull came to make me goggle again.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Al St. John ()", "Jim Kelley ()", "Lucille Hutton ()", "Glen Cavender ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
