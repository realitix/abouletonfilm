One of them is called home for dinner and the gang decides to let the creepy neighborhood fat kid join in. The first pitch is slammed over the fence, into the road, and the fat kid excitedly chases the ball. As the group taunts him and his efforts, they don't notice a truck speeding toward him. He is killed on impact. PRESENT DAY- The members of the old gang all receive mysterious invitations to reunite at an old lodge. Thinking one of the group must have some \"big announcement\", they all arrive at the lodge. What the group learns about the lodge and the real reason why they were \"invited\", leaves them fighting for their lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1bEMS1Atm7p7ECN1UzjmR23JMcP.jpg", "actors": ["Rick Kunzi (Dan Reese)", "Johanna Lixey (Lexy Carpenter)", "Bill Vincent (Henry Chambers)", "Ryann Davey (Melina Duchovny)", "Tommy Strasz (Tom Locane)", "Tricia Lyn Scott (Violet Beauregard)", "Katrina Novak (Jenny Hatcher)", "Nathaniel Nose (Keith Meyers)", "Brad Etheridge (Lee Hagen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
