Unfortunately, she can't afford to marry her new beau because her father has racked up numerous debts due to his uncontrollable gambling addiction. And to make matters even more complicated, there's a rival suitor who promises to pay off all of her no-good father's debts on the condition that he is given Hsiu Hsiu's hand in marriage. She initially declines his offer, but starts to get jealous when she sees Ta Lung getting a little too close for comfort with another woman. In retaliation, she starts flirting with her possible benefactor/husband-to-be. But what Hsiu Hsiu doesn't know is that her jealousy isn't based on any actual unfaithfulness, but on an unfortunate misunderstanding!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mnBF8X12stPFR5NvSKt93tY6IHD.jpg", "actors": ["Julie Yeh Feng (Gu Xiu Xiu)", "Guan Shan (Liu Da Long)", "Lee Ting (Xiao Cui)", "Ou-Yang Sha-Fei (Widow Zhu)", "Chu Mu (Tiger Zeng)", "Yeung Chi-Hing (Old Man Gu)", "Cheung Kwong-Chiu (Master Yao)", "Lam Fung (Scabby Wei)", "Ku Feng (Village youth serenading Xiu)", "Tsang Choh-Lam (Village youth's accomplice)", "Ha Yee-Chau (Village girl at campfire)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
