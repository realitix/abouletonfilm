The big movie moguls, fed up with Parson's power over their stars, decide to de-claw her by setting up gossip Hopper as a competitor in the rumour industry. What they couldn't forsee was that Hopper would become as big as Parsons -- and every bit as much of a pain. Based on the true life stories of two of the most powerful (and arguably dangerous) women of Hollywood's hay-day.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rXH84JOx3CJCS15UalJ2v3PVIOV.jpg", "actors": ["Elizabeth Taylor (Louella Parsons)", "Jane Alexander (Hedda Hopper)", "Richard Dysart (Louis B.
