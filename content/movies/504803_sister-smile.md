From the little that is known of the ill-fated nun's life, Italy-based American writer-director Roger Deutsch has made the boldly speculative yet persuasive Italian-language film \"Suor Sorriso\" in which the nun (Ginevra Colonna) emerges as a tormented, unstable woman who abruptly left the convent after her recording triumph before taking her final vows. Running a shelter for wayward girls, she and another ex-nun (Simona Caparrini) enter a passionate, tumultuous and destructive affair. Colonna's volcanic Deckers craves spiritual redemption as well as the other woman's love but is so beset by demons that she embarks on a flamboyant, drug-fueled downward spiral that ultimately engulfs her lover as well as herself.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Ginevra Colonna (Janine)", "Simona Caparrini (Clara)", "Antonio Salines (Vitale)", "Francesca Bianco (Madre Superiora)", "Alberto Buccolini ()", "Fabrizio Bordignon ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
