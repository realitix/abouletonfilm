What's more, the story line is actually interesting, and the two elements come together nicely in a few key places.\r Basically, the movie follows five older men, played by Clarke, producers Barry Knight and Russell Moore, with Ron Aron and Derrick Stanton, as they hold court in a luxury house filled with pretty party boys. Watching the young studs frolic in the backyard pool, the older generation reminisces about their own glory days as young gay men. While that could be a bittersweet scenario, Clarke's script finds more than a little fun in the concept, with an admirable sense of self-deprecating humor that manages to avoid being mean-spirited.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f4pTjeHxNY5rsqKcdfpRvlCRoyY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
