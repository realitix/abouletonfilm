Some changes are good - they send him a nanny, the enterprising Irena; some are bad - his phone number to Heaven no longer works nor do his special powers; and some dismay him - he grows a penis. His closest friend tells him to get a woman, and Irena advises him on hygiene. He visits a therapist, Roma, and falls in love with her. She tells him its transference. Meanwhile, Giordano's celestial friends conspire to rid Roma of her boyfriend, clearing the way for Giordano to be his naive and engaging self.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fgiUtPtRqabEvGiWxefx2RU6Fb2.jpg", "actors": ["Krzysztof Globisz (Angel Giordano)", "Anna Radwan (Psychotherapist Roma)", "Jerzy Trela (Kloszard \"Szajbusek\")", "Janusz Gajos (Kloszard warszawski \"Lupin\")", "Mieczys\u0142aw Gr\u0105bka (W\u0119glarz w Bieszczadach)", "Marta Bizo\u0144 (Irenka Rajska)", "Kamil Bera (Karol)", "Bart\u0142omiej \u015awiderski (Pawe\u0142, partner Romy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
