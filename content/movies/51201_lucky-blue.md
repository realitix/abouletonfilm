A sort of tradition that ends in a karaoke party. Then one summer, a family friend brings her reticent 'city boy' nephew, Kevin, and his pet budgerigar. Olle accidentally releases the bird and what follows is a discovery of friendship and love between the guy who has grown up in a loving environment and simply accepts love for what it is and the guy who's apparently been burned too many times in his own circle to feel comfortable with it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cizTZPDGgiI08dJKyEJeHWUEXtS.jpg", "actors": ["Tobias Bengtsson (Olle)", "Tom Lofterud (Kevin)", "Britta Andersson (Barbro)", "Johan Friberg (Kjelle)", "Michaela Berner (Amanda)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [200048, 49113, 122329, 419390], "youtube_key": "mq41ZqLbl8U"}
