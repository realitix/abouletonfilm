A delicate psychological allegory on 'a day in the life of' anchors the displacement of (filmic) reality and the alienation of the (players) self. Devices such as incongruity between the image and the soundtrack, odd camera angles, and plays on objective focus are integral and explicit components of the narrative. Altered to Suit diverges from preceding films in that the dialogue is not solely related to the work; rather the work serves as a central frame of reference from which the story unfolds. This is also the first time that narrative dominates the structure of the film. It is shot in black and white with very sensual, very seductive photography.\" \u2014 Alice Weiner", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/arosAi3MW137uR8QSwvMccDubfO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
