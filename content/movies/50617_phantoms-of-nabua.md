Nearby a flash of light is projected on a makeshift screen. This outdoor movie is a portrait of a village repeatedly struck by lightning. As night falls, the silhouette figures of young men emerge, they are playing with a football raging with fire. They take turns kicking the ball which leaves illuminated trails in the grass. The lightning on the screen flickers amid the fire and the smoke rising from the ground. The game intensifies with each kick that sends the fireball soaring into the air. Finally the teens burn the screen and crowd around it to witness the blazing canvas, behind which is revealed the ghostly white beam of a projector. Phantoms of Nabua is part of the multi-platform Primitive project which focuses on a concept of remembrance and extinction and is set in the northeast of Thailand.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/e5ps0cSNnVraebWMvXNZ08mxHUS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [130922, 206796, 297248, 130159], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
