The film also serves as a biography, chronicling English's evolution from a simple painter to an activist-instigator who skewers just about everything -- from Ronald McDonald to the war in Iraq.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l8bMJ3EbmWqUsTFccUoB2SvNz4s.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
