By day, they're \"Sunny & Share,\" injecting their twisted tunes about pedophilia, lung cancer and homemade bombs into the curriculum. By night, they walk on the dark side, dabbling in drugs, amateur porn and prostitution. Finally, a rock 'n' roll movie musical for the unattractive, unloved, unarmed inner child in each of us. -  Michele Mulroney, Micah Schraft, Chris Parnell", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4DpbZHPb6YU7Zs4X6y6rojF98e4.jpg", "actors": ["Michele Mulroney (Anneka)", "Micah Schraft (Clay)", "Chris Parnell (Kevin Keith Baker)", "Diedrich Bader (Mr. Jami)", "Martin Klebba (Jasper Johnson)", "Colin Fickes (Jason Trumble)", "Makenna Marks (Gyneth)", "Arabella Field (Mrs. Magoo)", "Matt Malloy (Principal Snark)", "Mink Stole (School Secretary Stole)", "Joel Michaely (Nicky)", "Briana Baesa (Jennie)", "Zak Boggan (Takwon)", "Robert John Brewer (The Cowboy (as Robert Brewer))", "Yahnique Brogan (Ya Ya)", "Sally Ann Brooks (Scooter Girl)", "Jennifer April Brown (Camilla's Mom)", "Brady Corbet (Guy on the Street)", "Nolan Gould (Jason)", "Shannon Woodward (Girl on the Street)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
