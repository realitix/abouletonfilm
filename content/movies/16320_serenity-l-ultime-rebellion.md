In may ways it felt like they took the major events that would have spanned the next 2 or 3 seasons and crammed it all into a 2 hour movie.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, it provides a decent sense of closure to the series."}, {"pseudo": "Matthew Sanders", "content": "This was an extremely poor movie. The weakest character during the TV series, River Tam, confusingly became the story focus in this movie.\r\n\r\nDespite never exercising and having a small frame, River fought and K.O.ed a room full of bar patrons.\r\n\r\nThe crew, mysteriously, were devoted to going to the planet River wanted to visit to help her discover her past despite showing various degrees of hostility toward her during the series ranging from open contempt to advocating her murder.\r\n\r\nThe main villains do not make sense. They are, supposedly, so wild that they regularly sack planets and cannibalize its inhabitants, but can still work together well enough to fly space ships. The entire population of these wild people came from the planet River wants to visit and from a single research facility. I'd guess about 1,000 research and support personnel were initially infected. They have no way of infecting further individuals, the facility was shut down, and yet their current population is many times the original amount. How?\r\n\r\nThe plot does not make sense. It is not engaging. None of the characters are interesting. The characters die without emotional impact. Pass on this movie. Like the TV series, this is a waste of time."}], "recommandations_id": [926, 2666, 1272, 2787]}
