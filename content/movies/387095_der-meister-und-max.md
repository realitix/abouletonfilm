In truth, Max is fictitious \u2013 born out of the fantasy of the filmmaker Clemens Klopfenstein, who created him as his alter ego. Max falls in love with the impassioned Christine, but she jilts him within a short time because of his reluctant disposition. He thus takes a decision: to call upon the \u201cmaster\u201d in the hopes that he can liberate him from the interminably same role. Based on works by Clemens Klopfenstein, the compilation film emerges as a new, self-contained story, while rendering palpable the very essence of the filmmaker.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
