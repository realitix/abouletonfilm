He has been forced to take care of his two younger siblings following the sudden death of their parents, and his soccer dreams have been halted. But when the same soccer hero sends him a VIP ticket to the big game in Johannesburg, Joe becomes determined to get himself to the stadium and prove to his idol that he still has what it takes.
