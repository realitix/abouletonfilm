Juha doesn't have the first intention of changing his way of life - just the opposite. He really enjoys sundry sexual relationships, adrenalin-inducing violence and, of course, alcohol for which he gets money even if by collecting bottles. But the hilarity in a drunken haze soon gets a run for its money as the passionate Juha falls in love with his AA group leader. The relationship with Tiina progresses quickly to dating and Juha has to make pivotal decisions.  Juha has to begin balancing between maintaining a functional intimate relationship and his old lifestyle. Juha's best friend Kristian does his best to sabotage the relationship, and Juha's shaky decision to stay sober is further hindered by Mikael, an expert on German erotica.  But how far can you go before there is only one solution left?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4n5LF0CVUpdaM16w7DmwKDF7fCB.jpg", "actors": ["Joonas Saartamo (Juha Berg)", "Krista Kosonen (Tiina)", "Santtu Karvonen (Kristian)", "Johannes Holopainen (Mikael)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [108762, 73099, 51190, 85988], "youtube_key": "Tswotl4F06k"}
