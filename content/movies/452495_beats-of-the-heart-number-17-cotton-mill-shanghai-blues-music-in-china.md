Cautiously, musicians, singers, composers and conductors re-emerged, returning from exile and reviving the ancient music of a vast and ethnically diverse country.  This film takes us to that very moment of regeneration, when director Jeremy Marre wove his way across China \u2013 from Shanghai to the Gobi desert \u2013 battling to avoid the \u2018official\u2019 ensembles and discover China\u2019s real musical soul. In Beijing, he was able to film Want Wen Guang, master of the ancient ququin instrument, in a passionate performance any blues guitarist would be proud of; and later we encounter drummer and Taoist priest Mo Zhong, whose hands were broken during the Cultural Revolution in order to keep him from playing. Today, DJs pipe muzak to the workers and the Shanghai music halls echo to the rhythms of the Chinese Tango as China looks to combine past and future.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aY8exIbohRRLptCEqEhMOz4L9AO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
