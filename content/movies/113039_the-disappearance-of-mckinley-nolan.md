Some say he was captured, some say he was a traitor, some even say he was an American operative. The US Army officially claims he was radicalized and went native, joining the Viet Cong and later encountering the Khmer Rouge. In 2006, retired US Army Lt.

So began a journey into the heart of darkness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/guYmfeQiCF00j4UDJGj6dtNgG5n.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Nolan (McKinley Nolan's brother)", "Richard Linnett (Journalist researching McKinley's story)", "Roger Nolan (McKinley Nolan's son)", "R.L.
