AMERICAN HARMONY journeys deep into the ultra-obsessive, zany, and heartfelt world of competitive barbershop singing, where passion is equaled only by raw talent, and the reward is not fame or fortune, but simply victory. The film focuses on four quartets vying to win the International Championships of Barbershop Singing, in what turns out to be the closest and most controversial victory in its 70 year history. Max Q is the heavy favorite - a superstar quartet comprised of former Champions. Looking to upset them is OC Times (The Heart-Throbs), Vocal Spectrum (The Rookies) and Reveille, an aging foursome who that has been together for 30 years. In total, fifty quartets duke it out for the coveted gold medal, while facing the pressures of quartet life - from big egos to brain cancer and everything in between.\r - Written by Colin King Miller", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/etMKqArqhZZ0SuTkf6UMRF8co7y.jpg", "actors": ["Greg Clancy (Himself)", "Patrick Claypool (Himself)", "Eric Dalbey (Himself)", "Tony DeRosa (Himself)", "Sean Devine (Himself)", "Mark Hale (Himself)", "Chris Hallam (Himself)", "Jim Henry (Himself)", "Cory Hunt (Himself)", "Joe Hunter (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
