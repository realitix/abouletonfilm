Meanwhile, seven locals die: the conservative and Catholic matriarch and very powerful lady, Quit\u00e9ria Campolargo; the corrupt lawyer C\u00edcero Branco; the Spanish anarchist shoemaker Barcelona; the drunkard Pudim de Cacha\u00e7a; the prostitute Erotildes; the student Jo\u00e3o da Paz; and the pianist Menandro Olinda. Once their bodies remain unburied due to the general strike, they decide to claim to the local authorities the right of being buried. The Major Vivaldino Braz\u00e3o, the judge Quintiliano do Vale, the \"Colonel\" Tib\u00e9rio Vacariano and the local sheriff are not able to force the workers to return to their normal activities, so the dead citizens disclose dark secrets about corruption of the leaders and the dwellers. Once they are corpses, they are not subject to the laws of the living and they can freely speak about the sordid hidden secrets.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lWKbrSeaZiyhs2ickDVPiuFw7pH.jpg", "actors": ["Luciana Migliaccio (Actress)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
