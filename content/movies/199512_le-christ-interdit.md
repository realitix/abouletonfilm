Freshly released from a Russian POW camp, Italian soldier Raf Vallone tries to discover who betrayed his brother to the Nazis. Alain Cuny is an enigmatic carpenter who has confessed to causing the brother's death. Cuny is slain by Vallone, whereupon it is revealed that the carpenter sacrificed himself on behalf of the real culprit, Phillipe Lemaire. Vallone catches up with Lemaire, but is unable to kill him, thanks to the Christlike example of Cuny. Originally titled Il Cristo Proibito (The Forbidden Christ, just so we don't miss the point), this film represented the movie directorial debut of novelist Curzio Malaparte, who also wrote the musical score.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/liOGXXPh6bchY176HIHFsZsWQf1.jpg", "actors": ["Raf Vallone (Bruno Baldi)", "Alain Cuny (Antonio)", "Gino Cervi (K\u00fcster)", "Rina Morelli (Mother Baldi)", "Anna Maria Ferrero (Maria)", "Elena Varzi (Nella)", "Ernesta Rosmino (Assunta)", "Philippe Lemaire (Pinin)", "Luigi Tosi (Andrea)", "Gualtiero Tumiati (Bruno's Father)", "Lianella Carell ()", "Gabriele Ferzetti ()", "Giulia Sabatini ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
