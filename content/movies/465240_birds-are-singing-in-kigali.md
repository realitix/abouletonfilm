Anna manages to save the daughter of a colleague whose family has been murdered, and she takes her to Poland. But the woman returns to Rwanda to visit the graves of her loved ones. The director originally worked on the movie with her husband Krzysztof Krauze (My Nikifor \u2013 Crystal Globe, KVIFF 2005), but after his death in 2014 she eventually finished this challenging picture alone.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zTUfkVqprwP4me7afom1vCCJ0zD.jpg", "actors": ["Jowita Budnik (Anna)", "Eliane Umuhire (Claudine)", "Witold Wielinski ()", "Ciza Remy Muhirwa (Jean Paul)", "Herve Kimenyi Rutaremara (Sebastian)", "Anna Ilczuk (Falska)", "Aleksander Miko\u0142ajczak (Pu\u0142kownik)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "o4T3yNsQgRs"}
