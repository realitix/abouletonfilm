Greed and lust lead him down a path of orgasmic highs and painful, unimaginable lows. Directed by the master of porn, Pierre Woodman, \"That's Life\", is a compelling classic and a perfect example of retro-hardcore, driven by a dynamic script full of knee trembling sex scenes including up close anal and double penetrations and featuring among other beauties, the delectable Katja Kean who has the body of a tanned goddess. What would you do if you came into more than 10 million dollars and then lost it again? \"C'est la vie\" as the French say.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8GgOdBhmPiJG7MTCSjwCYsdJ8ZO.jpg", "actors": ["Sophie (Femme de Marcel)", "Anita Gissiger (La Bourgeoise)", "Bagheera (La Postiere)", "Suzan Nielsen (Fille TV)", "Brenda Logan (La Directrice)", "Wanda Curtis (La Cliente)", "Mira Janik (Pute Fiesta)", "Isabella Gray (Pute Fiesta)", "Jean-Yves Le Castel (Marcel Dupont)", "Tony Toscany (Le Postier)", "Andrew Youngman (Homme TV)", "Richard Langin (Henri Golard)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
