The film is somewhat formulaic with some stereotypical portrayals, like that of the love interest Nicky, or the crew of California firm that wants to hire Dean. But there's just enough heart to be an enjoyable story.  Casting was good.  Martin feels like Dean. Jacobs feels like Nicky.  And, Kline is himself playing Robert (father)."}], "recommandations_id": [468320, 455847, 414454, 410144]}
