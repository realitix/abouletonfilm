This daring new video insightfully analyzes Disney's cultural pedagogy, examines its corporate power, and explores its vast influence on our global culture. Including interviews with cultural critics, media scholars, child psychologists, kindergarten teachers, multicultural educators, college students and children, Mickey Mouse Monopoly will provoke audiences to confront comfortable assumptions about an American institution that is virtually synonymous with childhood pleasure.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cPoTeoBqLXpfmOKmpPDYN5Wsyqw.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
