Three poor wandering musicians come by the tree and create instruments from it. Walking around the country instead of happiness they bring death everywhere with their cursed instruments. However they cannot get rid of them, unless they bury the wooden instruments at the place of the tree. The three are anything but harmonious, each taking in their disputes various stances.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z5OZh2rselM53i5dWU9AX7wiS7d.jpg", "actors": ["Martin Huba (Musician)", "Juraj Kukura (Musician)", "Gust\u00e1v Valach (Musician)", "Beata Znakova (Juliana)", "Peter Gazo (Young Man)", "Margita Mazalova (Mother)", "Elena Volkova (Mother)", "Em\u00edlia Dosekov\u00e1  (Mother)", "Maria Markovicova (Mother)", "Hana Kovacikova (Miller)", "Zuzana Koc\u00farikov\u00e1 (Anicka)", "Darina Janecova (Anicka)", "Anna Blazkova (Hanicka)", "Ivan Pal\u00fach (Janicko)", "J\u00falius Va\u0161ek (Soldier)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
