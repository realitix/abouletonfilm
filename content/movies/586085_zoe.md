It shows the daily life of a woman trying to find herself in a city that is itself in transition. ZOE was shot in 1992, not long after the reunification of Berlin. The poetic 16mm black and white imagery shows Eastern districts such as Mitte and Prenzlauer Berg before many buildings there were demolished or remodeled.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/939Qr2hZOB12jE2WH9UxqjObnF0.jpg", "actors": ["Irene Holzfurtner (Zoe)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
