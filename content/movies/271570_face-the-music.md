Of course, everybody knows that nothing rockets a band to the big time better than the death of a lead singer, and when the band agrees to fake Dan's death in exchange for some well-timed publicity, the plan pays off better than they ever might have expected. The trouble is, a beautiful female reporter has been assigned to investigate the mysterious death, and now, as her reporter's instincts lead her ever closer to the truth, the \"dead man\" realizes that the girl of his dreams is also the girl who could destroy his career if news breaks of the band's elaborate ruse.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tOKpG4vKKEVgjXfPFLg3rsmGmrx.jpg", "actors": ["Tyler Christopher (Dan)", "Elena Lyons (Claire)", "Sharon Leal (Tracie)", "Harry Van Gorkum (Puzzles Levy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
