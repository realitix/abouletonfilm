Thus, Jim asks the boy, whom he protects like a brother, to speak for him. When he is spurned by Ronnie, Harvey decides to join Red Slade's gang, who are plotting a raid on the Wind River herd. As Jim forcibly attempts to separate him from the gang, Harvey is killed; and through the aid of his horse, Tarzan, Jim foils Slade's attempt to stampede the herd. Slade takes refuge in a wagon where Ronnie is hiding; Jim rescues Ronnie from the wagon just before the runaway team plunges over a cliff with Slade riding to his doom.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vcDEYglfG6vlX5aqPUlaBUTuhqi.jpg", "actors": ["Ken Maynard (Jim Brandon)", "Doris Hill (Veronica 'Ronnie' Stavnow)", "Joseph W.
