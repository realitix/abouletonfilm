Hans is baking his seven-layer Chocolate Cherry Truffle Cake with Double Butter-cream Frosting. Violet is putting the finishing touches on her mountainous bouquet. Lucia is warming up for her solo, featuring the amazing Dr. Marvel and his Marvelaphony-organoni. And Punchinello is just baffled. He has nothing that would even compare to their fabulous creations, and especially nothing wonderful enough to honor Eli on Maker Day. Yet, in the midst of the celebration, something goes terribly awry and Punchinello comes to the rescue with the most precious gift of all-a gift from the hearts of all Wemmicks to honor the Maker on His special day.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yrfc5FkYLS7xQxTrPyOE5hV9rHc.jpg", "actors": ["Chana Keefer (Lucia (voice))", "Mark Keefer (Punchinello (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
