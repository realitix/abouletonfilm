In it he compares meat eating to child abuse; attacks the Royal Family and Tony Blair; responds to the accusations of racism; and we hear about his depression. There\u2019s also some great concert footage, and a mixed selection of celebrity fans who explain their fervor for the Mozz: J K Rowling identifies with Morrissey in a darkened room, though still won\u2019t give up bacon; former neighbor, playwright Alan Bennett couldn\u2019t say his name, but thinks he has an interesting face with a story to tell; Will Self likes his muscular intellect; Noel Gallagher thinks he is the greatest ever lyricist; Chrissie Hynde thinks people who don\u2019t get him can go fuck themselves; Bono thinks he\u2019s funny; and Nancy Sinatra says he\u2019s a great hugger.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xqtXcDA5O7i3MnnpHRGKjRDsV9.jpg", "actors": ["Morrissey (Himself)", "Bono (Himself)", "Johnny Marr (Himself (archival footage))", "Nancy Sinatra (Herself)", "Christopher Eccleston (Narrator)", "J.K.
