The social realism is replaced by colourful, convivial and dancing shots of the \u201cPabieda\u201d (Victory) kolkhoz, where peasant women sing in the fields, and boys march with banners glorifying revolution. Against this backdrop, intense romantic feelings have reached a climactic stage; tailor Sidor Sidorovich, farmer Jushka and soldier Danila Petrovich all dote on the fair-haired Odarka. It is Jushka and Danila who engage in overt hostility; the initial \u201cgentlemen\u2019s\u201d contest turns into an outright confrontation, resulting in miserable Jushka being increasingly more desperate and scorned by the villagers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1Ooz3JJG8PLnlF5uiotKhlWZ9LF.jpg", "actors": ["Lyudmila Sosyura ()", "Yuri Satarov ()", "Grigori Karpov ()", "Varvara Chayka ()", "Nikolay Shutko ()", "Boris Matveyev ()", "Nikolay Yakovchenko ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
