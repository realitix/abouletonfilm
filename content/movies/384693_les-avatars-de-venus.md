Finally, I collected a giant image\u2013bank of different incarnations of Venus spreading across time and space, coming from all continents, all civilizations, all epochs, respecting the logic of each one of them, regardless of the arbitrary ideological hierarchy established by academicians between High Art and Low Art. I chose to mix art history and popular imagery, Renaissance iconography and commercial advertisements, religious propaganda and common pornographic icons, movie stars and classical as well as non-occidental sculpture, all fetishes being complementary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bgSdDyxjRm9bAfd3H1y4Nh5uFO2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
