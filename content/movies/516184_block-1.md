The large camera was OK, but it was too big to carry along on walks. It didn't have legs so that I could lead it around on a leash like a dog. The little camera, on the other hand, was like a baby which could be stowed in my bag. The salesman was surprised when I kissed the baby camera after he handed it to me. I immediately set off on my first stroll with camera. I thought it was great because I could immediately film everything my eyes stumbled upon. The baby camera was like a gun and ready to go after visual prey.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2qhArEKOmgTuAzgWXdhYhflK4AG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
