Born in Poland but fortunate enough to escape the country before the Nazi occupation and the Holocaust wiped out her family, she is stunned to learn her older sister somehow survived the horror and is coming to America. The sisters' reunion is complicated by Lusia's (Amanda Plummer) memories of her struggles to survive and the revelation of past family secrets.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oy6VFWtB46ltdKInoRshJEsIaUk.jpg", "actors": ["Kyra Sedgwick (Reyzel Weiss/Rose White)", "Maureen Stapleton (Tanta Perla)", "Maximilian Schell (Mordecai Weiss)", "Amanda Plummer (Lusia)", "Penny Fuller (Miss Kate Ryan)", "Gina Gershon (Angie)", "D.
