'Leaving Traces,' a feature documentary, follows the artists - including renowned photographers Alec Soth, Hiroshi Watanabe, Hank Willis Thomas, Kate Joyce, Frank Hunter, and Alex Harris, and writer Adam Sobsey - as they confront the challenges of finding something new in a baseball park. While techniques and output vary widely, this diverse group is united by baseball's (and photography's) unique experience with time. The slow, repetitive movements often hide the roiling drama beneath. By interweaving stories about process and craft, 'Leaving Traces' evokes baseball's atmosphere and captures the struggle to make the unseen visible.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
