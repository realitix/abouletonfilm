In todays world, it became practice to give kids (and sometimes for women) their own version of what meant for only grownups. So there's no use whining about that. Because those who does might not be the target audience. This is I think purely for kids, otherwise it would have not got bold PG, but like usual for any film, I gave it a try. Even though it's not original, somewhat I enjoyed watching it.\r\n\r\nThe story was in usual pattern that opened with an intro, then moving to unleash the long trapped ancient creatures into the human society. One becomes friend with it and a few starting to hunt it with the rest are as the neutral or unaware of it. There's nothing unpredictable in it. And so the tale comes to halt with a finale where maximum push was given, but overall it fails to impress on the average expectation.\r\n\r\nGood title, good idea, even the graphics were not bad, but not good enough stunts with okay performances. I feel it could have become a good television series than the film. So they should scrap the idea if they have one for a sequel and instead make a shift to television. Other than what I thought, this is a good entertainer for little kids. So it should be watched by them more than their counterparts.\r\n\r\n_5\u00bd/10_"}, {"pseudo": "Gimly", "content": "Did I enjoy _Monster Trucks_?
