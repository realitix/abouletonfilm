Against their proper sensibilities, many of the Brits don't much like the brash Yanks, especially when it comes to the G.I.s making advances on the lonely British girls. One relationship that develops is between married John, an Army Captain, and the aristocratic Helen, whose naval husband is away at war. Helen loves her husband, but Helen and John are looking for some comfort during the difficult times.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1J5vzYsYlB6BmUOsrDfAu86359d.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Gere (Matt Dyson)", "Lisa Eichhorn (Jean Moreton)", "Vanessa Redgrave (Helen)", "William Devane (John)", "Chick Vennera (Danny Ruffelo)", "Wendy Morgan (Mollie)", "Martin Smith (Geoff)", "Derek Thompson (Ken)", "Joan Hickson (Mrs. Moody)", "Arlen Dean Snyder (Henry)", "Annie Ross (Red Cross lady)", "Rachel Roberts (Mrs Clarrie Moreton)", "Tony Melody (Mr Jim Moreton)", "John Ratzenberger (Cpl Cook)", "Tom Nolan (Tom)", "Andy Pantelidou (Cook)", "Francis Napier (Cook)", "Antony Sher (GI at Cinema)", "John Cassidy (2nd GI at Cinema)", "George Harris (Black driver)", "Lynne Carol (Annie)", "June Ellis (Mrs Shenton)", "Everett McGill (Racist GI at Dance)", "Al Matthews (Black GI at dance)", "Eugene Lipinski (Barman)", "Paul Luty (Landlord)", "Paula Tilbrook (Neighbour)", "Anne Dyson (Ivy)", "Pearl Hackney (Aunt Maud)", "Gertie Almond (Neighbour)", "Joe Gladwin (Plumber)", "Jackie Shinn (Chip Shop Owner)", "Rachel Davies (Girl in Club)", "Angela Curran (Second Girl in Club)", "Ken Drury (Jock)", "Nat Jackley (Postman)", "Patrick Durkin (Dance MC)", "Sue Robinson (Girl at Dance)", "Caroline Blakiston (Golfing friend)", "Donald Pickering (Golfing friend)", "Lynne Perrie (Woman at Railway Station)", "Nick Brimble (Merchant Seaman)", "Ken Jones ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [42599, 70259, 43912, 195435], "youtube_key": "Z-JrGhAoXM4"}
