Writer-director Mbongeni Ngema cautions his cast that their opinions could bring trouble from the government once they return to South Africa. The cast later meets exiled singer Mariam Makeba, who in a moving, sentimental gesture expresses her gratitude for the company bringing the story to the rest of the world. The performance combines singing and dancing, combining ancient folk songs with modern music from Hugh Masakela and others from South Africa.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cwFQXu10AczYlBZeMl8kL7xjYhB.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
