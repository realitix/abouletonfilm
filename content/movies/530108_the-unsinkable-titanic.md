One of the largest and most luxurious passenger liners at the time, the Titanic was also equipped with watertight compartments, which led many to consider the ship unsinkable; an anonymous deckhand famously claimed that \u201cGod himself could not sink this ship.\u201d On April 14, however, the ship struck an iceberg, and early the next day it sank. Some 1,500 people perished.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m3py1JoOPM3s3RTRv965tMC8Fqy.jpg", "actors": ["Sean Pertwee (Narrator)", "Malcolm Tierney (Captain Edward Smith)", "Mark Tandy (Bruce Ismay)", "Darrell D'Silva (Charles Lightoller)", "Dominic Jephcott (Attorney General Sir Rufus Isaacs)", "Jason Maza (Harold Bride)", "Karl Davies (Jack Phillips)", "Ciaran Kellgren (Frederick Fleet)", "Gary Cargill (Frederick Barrett)", "Shaughan Seymour (Alexander Carlisle)", "Noel Burton (William Murdoch)", "Jennifer Jo Hooper (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
