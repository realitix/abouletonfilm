An imaginary journey throughout Europe tracing\r cartography of the ruin, a melancholic voyage through time, a look at fingerprints and trace, absence, stone and dust. To experience the silver film as wall experiences the passing of men and time, in search of fracture, a breach where only it survives, among the ashes and the debris, a blind light wave travels a wasted land.\r There is no bond that time does not erase.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Aa6HzNBGdBi39m47PGgwZ3ojxrV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
