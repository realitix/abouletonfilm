They conclude that our need for self-realization through consumption leaves us with a sense of meaninglessness. An experiment is initiated and they gather a group of young people in an isolated house in the countryside. During the stay in the house, Simon gradually becomes a sovereign leader. What started out as a field study gradually turns into something more similar to a cult.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b65U6fFMsE6Gr686L8wOJaIqzVQ.jpg", "actors": ["Jonathan Sil\u00e9n (Simon)", "Ylva Olaison (Sara)", "Karin Bengtsson (Rakel)", "Sigmund Hovind (Stian)", "Sally Palmquist Procop\u00e9 (Johanna)", "Eric Stern (Arvid)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
