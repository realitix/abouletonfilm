Recharge my energy storage units, baby! Oops! Hi there. See that female human lifeform in the picture? That's Amber, and I'm Woody, the non-human semi-lifeform. Boy, does Amber like to have her biological procreation urges stimulated! My boss inventor, Harvey Woodman, hired her as a domestic, but before we knew it she was blowing everyone's fuses. First, it was Harvey and his wife Mag, then the kinky next door neighbor... and then me! Wow, was I turned on! Amber is gone now, but I'll tell you I really overloaded my circuits, the last time I saw Amber Aroused.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dpWaFmqd7rAba2VAolmPP9Tueg7.jpg", "actors": ["Amber Lynn (Terry Schaffer)", "Crystal Breeze (Mag Woodman)", "Mindy Rae ()", "Pamela Jennings ()", "Renee Tiffany ()", "Shaun Michelle ()", "Kathlyn Moore ((as Denise Kelly))", "Tracy Duzit ((as Tracy Does It))", "Billy Dee ()", "Buck Adams ((uncredited))", "Craig Roberts ()", "Herschel Savage ()", "Jay Serling (Harvey Woodman)", "Ron Jeremy (Dom)", "Sasha Gabor (The Bandit)", "Shone Taylor ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
