Zbigniew Cybulski and Sonja Ziemann play a married couple who fall through the cracks of Red bureaucracy in Warsaw. The film does not endeavor to preach, merely to present a matter-of-fact glance at how little the individual matters when confronted with mountains of red tape. Upon its completion in 1958, the government refused to allow Eighth Day of the Week to be shown in Poland; it would not been seen anywhere until its European release one year later.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5ENnQudiRO1217fsa9AQ5Fz110L.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
