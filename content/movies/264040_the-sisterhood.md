Hope aspires to winning the local drag beauty pageant, Rollie is the raining queen of the pageant and dreams of finding a husband, and Pietie struggles with his religious upbringing while obsessing over his roses, chickens, and pigeons. These three trans-gender wine workers confront prejudice at every turn from their farming community, city trans-genders and the world at large. Roger Horn's film manages to find the fabulous in the fraught and offers a portrait of triumph in togetherness rather than loneliness in victimization", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
