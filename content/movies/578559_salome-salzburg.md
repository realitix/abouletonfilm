Also hewn into the M\u00f6nchsberg rock a stone's throw south is the Felsenreitschule \u2013 literally Rock Riding School \u2013 the former cavalry stables, now festival theatre. In Romeo Castellucci's production of Strauss' Salome there, Te saxa loquuntur is emblazoned across the frontcloth. Before the curtain rises, Salome takes a sword and slices through this inscription. What secrets would these stones impart?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9AuCOO5WUZvG6rpwWknfmFPrH5B.jpg", "actors": ["John Daszak ()", "Anna Maria Chiuri ()", "Julian Pregardien ()", "Asmik Grigorian ()", "J\u00f6rg Schneider ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
