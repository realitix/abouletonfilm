As a first step, he forces Metin to live alone for a month, away from his mother, with whom he has a relationship that borders on too close. Kars wonders to what degree we can mold peoples' lives. The twentysomething Metin doesn\u2019t really know what to do with himself\u2014his friends consider him smart and creative, but he never applies these traits to actions. It\u2019s striking to see the contrast between Metin and the cheerful youth leaders from his boyhood scouting troop. He's also very different from his climbing instructor, who teaches him that you have think about where you\u2019re going\u2014to plan out your steps on your way up the rock wall. But planning isn\u2019t Metin\u2019s thing. Instead, he wants to make people think about what a successful life entails. Millennials will recognize a lot in Independent Boy, as will anyone who has ever been in their twenties.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iIUSiOaFUYibN8y7fJvRcKpTECM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
