This film serves as a reminder of that first festival in 1972, and captures the spirit of Sunbury's ethos - \"to have a good time\". So join your host Molly Meldrum - dressed in the style of the times - and sit back, relax, crank up the volume, and stroll down memory lane to Sunbury.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fnW7e2SyBtcFTyzUpW4zT8sxGnd.jpg", "actors": ["Ian 'Molly' Meldrum (Self)", "Billy Thorpe (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
