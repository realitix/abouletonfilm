Funnily enough forgotten until now, she was the woman behind Solomon Guggenheim, Frank Lloyd Wright and Wassily Kandinsky, just to name a few. She promoted the avant-garde who eventually became the most famous artists of their time.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
