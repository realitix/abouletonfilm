The film\u2019s concept adheres to formalist cinema, where the filmmaker\u2019s thesis is to make a semblance of a vintage film seemingly produced sometime in the late 1920s to early 1930s in the Philippines. The thesis is to conjure up a film from a period that did not really exist in Philippine cinema\u2019s historical cultural heritage as we know it, such as a pseudo-expressionist / experimental Filipino cinema of the silent film era. It is a film within a film. The narrative plays with the idea of a retro-futurist world where a prisoner locked away in a dark chamber for over two decades only sees the reality of the world outside through the small hole in his cell, which projects an image of the city on his wall, the phenomenon of the \u201ccamera obscura\u201d.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pKtYl6OZ3cFNerOfORtaieFBcjj.jpg", "actors": ["Pen Medina ()", "Ping Medina ()", "Lou Veloso ()", "Joel Torre ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
