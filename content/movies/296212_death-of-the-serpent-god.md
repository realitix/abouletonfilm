The reality of migration bears its teeth: Following a scuffle, 20-year-old Koumba from France is sent back to the place where she was raised \u2013 Senegal. She returns to the lost village of her ancestors hysterical, argumentative and unproductively rebellious. Now the mother of a toddler, she continues to come to terms with the two cultures; the outcome is unforeseeable, as is the outcome of this cinematic long-term observation. The risk of its failure due to its protagonist is palpable. But Koumba\u2019s fascinating metamorphosis is also obvious, her body and character have taken on a more harmonious nature. All hope is not lost.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uJvhFPbrNlSeHcFDctZAdGhlE7v.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
