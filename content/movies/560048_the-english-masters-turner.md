Turner, by the end of his life, was the best known artists in England during the Romantic period and one of the forerunners of Impressionism.  A life-long lover of landscape and seascape painting, he traveled widely in search of inspiration. No artist had ever painted light and color as Turner did in his astonishing later works. These paintings such as Rain, Steam, Speed and The Fighting Temerair were the conclusion to the long evolution of the art of J. M. W. Turner.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uB7i7YUgVVxg6MSBkCB9gxTPuRD.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
