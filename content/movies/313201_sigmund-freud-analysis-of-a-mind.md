Yet, fears and obsessions wracked the father of psychoanalysis. His theories continue to inspire debate, even as the discipline he invented drifts farther from his work. Through personal letters, diaries and interviews with biographers, psychiatrists and Freud's grandchildren, this documentary explores the life of the man who was once derided as the doctor of love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xNsvPajcOYXPVzCy93gCYLVfH4i.jpg", "actors": ["Sigmund Freud (Himself (archive footage))", "Joe Aguayo (Himself - Psychologist, Historian)", "Harold P.
