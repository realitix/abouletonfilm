The crew travels from town to town filming bands performing in houses that're about to be demolished or burned to the ground. In one day they document the house, the bands, and the demolition, then put it together in a 50-minute movie and move on to the next town. Extras include an extended slide show of stills of the day's bands as well as stills of the destruction and film production.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6kRPtiyAeknGGnCQXgqQxXVXggt.jpg", "actors": ["Carrie Brownstein (Herself)", "Corin Tucker (Herself)", "Janet Weiss (Herself)", "Colin Meloy (Himself)", "Chris Funk (Himself)", "Jenny Conlee (Herself)", "Nate Query (Himself)", "John Moen (Himself)", "Beth Ditto (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
