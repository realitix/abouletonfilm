This most American form of entertainment can be found in films from other countries, but it's the American vast landscape, which gives films of this genre the appeal and the significance that translates so well in movies made by some of the best creators in the business. \"Wanderlust\" succeeds in the interviews with some of the best creators of this particular style of movie making. We hear from Dennis Hopper, whose \"Easy Rider\", and others, typify the restlessness of the people taking the road. Allison Anders, another director that has set her stories that way, speaks intelligently about what is behind it all. Callie Khouri, Chris Eyre, Alexander Payne, Wim Wenders, Sam Shepard, Gus Van Sant and all the others contribute to make clear as to why we are all attracted to the road and what it all means to them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yEznkMjKme4ttyfjfiX6W5mYcfL.jpg", "actors": ["Allison Anders (Herself)", "Jeanine Basinger (Herself)", "Robert Benton (Himself)", "Karen Black (Herself)", "Peter Bogdanovich (Himself)", "Jeff Brouws (Himself)", "William S.
