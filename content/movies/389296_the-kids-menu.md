In THE KIDS MENU, Joe meets with experts, parents, teachers and kids, coming to the realization that childhood obesity isn't the real issue, but rather a symptom of a bigger problem. The lack of knowledge of what healthy foods are. Lack of access to healthy and affordable options. And the influence of negative role models, whether a parent, teacher or even a celebrity. All of this together seems to be a lot to overcome, but when empowered, kids often make the surprising choice of the healthier path.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6EMYplN1XK50BlVGpKGwpnKJ4XK.jpg", "actors": ["Joe Cross (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [336992, 411918, 403581, 409564], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
