Behind-the-scenes it's just for fun. Erotic encounters on the sets of fashion shoots! Seventeen boys... no clothes... you do the math. When the photoshoots finish, the real fun begins. Join the Bel Ami boys as they blur the line between work and play. The Bel Ami cameras record every steamy second: two-ways, three-ways and a sixteen-boy orgy make this one video you must add to your collection. This Director's Cut contains a bonus episode with Gilles Marais and Roman Chaykin not seen in the original version. A \"behind the scenes\" fact: Bel Ami saved a lot of money on costumes on this project!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7164hFRit2WYFqjS5itrO5mKz8B.jpg", "actors": ["Mark Aubrey (Himself)", "Sebastian Bonnet (Himself)", "Chris Cameron (Himself)", "Roman Chaykin (Himself)", "Claude Cocteau (Himself)", "Jeff Daniels (Himself)", "Tim Hamilton (Himself)", "Gilles Marais (Himself)", "Jason Paradis (Himself)", "Ryan Pawlowski (Himself)", "Julian Armanis (Himself)", "Yves Carradine (Himself)", "Sascha Chaykin (Himself)", "Alan Connery (Himself)", "Tony Davis (Himself)", "Martin Eden (Himself)", "Alex Orioli (Himself)", "Johnny Ritts (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
