When the three men run into a former professor of the architect and designer, they are inspired by his fanfare and expansive nature. Still in search of solutions to their particular problems, the men head out to visit the professor and get to the bottom of their own issues. Unfortunately, the professor turns out to be more \"loco\" than otherwise, and the three men watch their hopes burst like a popped balloon -- it seems like their ability to assess human character should now be added to their list of problem spots.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/62I9m4zXQQceDnBEQ8wGm8pD5BV.jpg", "actors": ["Jean-Marc Bory (Bruno)", "Pierre Cl\u00e9menti (Philippe)", "Heinz Bennent (Manfred)", "Jean-Pierre Malo (Paul)", "Aurore Cl\u00e9ment (Zo\u00e9)", "S\u00e9verine Bujard (Sonia)", "Anne Lonnberg (H\u00e9l\u00e8ne)", "Hilde Ziegler (Inge)", "Anne Bennent (La fausse italienne)", "B\u00e9rang\u00e8re Mastrangelo ()", "Armand Deladoey ()", "Nicole Die ()", "Marie-Luce Felber ()", "William Jacques ()", "Dominique Stehl\u00e9 ()", "Simon Soutter ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
