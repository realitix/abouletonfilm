These children had been wandering the country as street performers for four years and are virtual \"untouchables\" to most Chinese. The camera follows them in their daily rounds through the streets, performing acrobatic tricks and begging. It captures their daily struggles for survival and their dream to return home and go to school, and looks at how these children face the challenges of a harsh environment with inner strength.  Through this program we have a window on a little known aspect of Chinese society today and the realities facing so many of the world's children.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9wtNHK1ZsO06j1FNdx7gGk07N05.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
