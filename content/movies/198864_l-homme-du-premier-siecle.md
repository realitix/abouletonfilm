He discovers that in his long absence, the world has literally cleaned up well, solved its problems, and is rife with a multitude of technical toys to make life easier. All of these conveniences, however, have not had much effect on the basic foibles that have plagued humanity since cave-dwelling days. Of significance are the names of two of the main characters -- Adam and Eve.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3oxfpa6rXhW8S2LQFJCHLW5qwGK.jpg", "actors": ["Milo\u0161 Kopeck\u00fd (Josef, caloun\u00edk)", "Anita Kajlichova (Eve)", "V\u00edt Olmer (Adam)", "Lubom\u00edr Lipsk\u00fd ()", "Vladim\u00edr Hlavat\u00fd ()", "Josef Hlinomaz (Foreman)", "Anna Pita\u0161ov\u00e1 ()", "Zden\u011bk \u0158eho\u0159 ()", "Otomar Krej\u010da ()", "Radovan Lukavsk\u00fd (Peter)", "Ji\u0159\u00ed R\u016f\u017ei\u010dka ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
