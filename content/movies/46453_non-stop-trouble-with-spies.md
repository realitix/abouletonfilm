Herbie the cabbie is recruited by the KGB and East German Intelligence to help them discover who murdered the man in his back seat. After arriving on the West German side of the divide, Herbie is then recruited by the CIA and West German Intelligence to become a counterspy, for double what the other side is paying him. As Herbie seems to have no viable way out of this mess, he goes to a therapist for help. Reaching into her bag of tricks, she gives Herbie a small bottle he can sniff when in need of self-confidence, an act guaranteed to put him on top of any situation. Now Herbie is a cabbie, a KGB agent, a CIA agent, and a bottle sniffer -- and he is falling in love with his gorgeous therapist.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wzOOuSUPfVeTfaCkwDyI1WFhKuK.jpg", "actors": ["Dieter Hallervorden (Herbert B\u00f6ckmann, Herbie Melbourne)", "Catherine Alric (Anna)", "Tilo Pr\u00fcckner (Fred)", "Anton Diffring (Colonel Henderson)", "Siegfried Wischnewski (Oberst Protopopov)", "Peter Kuiper (Dimitri)", "Charles Regnier (Mr. X)", "Siegfried Kernen (Professor Pr\u00e4torius)", "Gustl Bayrhammer (Herr Huber)", "Eddie Constantine (Gregori Ustinov)", "Gerd Vespermann (Restaurant-Chef)", "Carsta L\u00f6ck (Frau Prietschke)", "Manfred Lehmann (Amerikaner)", "Horst Poenichen (Antiquit\u00e4tenh\u00e4ndler)", "Utz Richter (Major Mahlke)", "Hans Schellbach (Boris Stravinski)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
