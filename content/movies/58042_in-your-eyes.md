The story was nice. But then it could've been presented better. Anne Curtis was amazing. I can't help but notice how her acting was so much better that Claudine's. And that says a lot knowing that Claudine is an A-list actress here. I was disappointed with her acting. Tears couldn't even go down from her eyes. Richard was the same just like all of his other movies. I think, with a better actor, the movie could've made more sense. Richard's love for Anne was not that deep enough to cause a major drama like this one. It was like all about lust for him. You couldn't feel the love. And the editing was bad and even the lines were very corny. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"I think I'll like it here in America after all.\" I mean who says that?????\r\n\r\n\r\nMy rate for this movie is C."}], "recommandations_id": []}
