The plot, two women and their love for one another, is of secondary importance. An ingenious combination of stereoscopic images and montage of individual pictures make new qualities of perception accessible to the viewer. In the final part of the love scenes pictorial sequences and music build up to a delirious rhythm.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lsrBTur03y21qwEccEPWgww8IWO.jpg", "actors": ["Dore O.
