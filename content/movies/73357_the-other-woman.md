She and her boy friend, Ronnie, devise a plan to lure Darman to her apartment, where she gives him a drugged drink. She tells Darman they had been intimate and blackmails him for $50,000. More than a little distracted by his situation, his wife senses something is wrong and he gets into a violent argument with his father-in-law who owns the producing company Darman works for, and discontinues the picture. Sherry informs Darman she is going to tell his wife all about them. Darman tells his secretary that he is going to work late and is not to be disturbed, sets the moviola runnings, and exits by the back door and hot-foots it to Sherry's apartment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gWFot2mfb5T2jhCLEy5fV66X1we.jpg", "actors": ["Hugo Haas (Walter Darman)", "Cleo Moore (Sherry Steward)", "Lance Fuller (Ronnie)", "Lucille Barkley (Mrs. Lucille Darman)", "Jack Macy (Charles Lester)", "John Qualen (Papasha)", "Jan Arvan (Police Inspector Collins)", "Karolee Kelly (Marion)", "Steve Mitchell (1st Assistant Director)", "Mark Lowell (2nd Assistant Director)", "Melinda Markey (Actress)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
