Stafford Dickens, Command Performance is also beholden to The Prisoner of Zenda and other Ruritanian romances of that ilk. Neil Hamilton stars as Peter Fedor, a stage actor who bears a striking resemblance to Prince Alexis of Kordovia (also Neil Hamilton). Getting into a fight with the hotheaded Alexis, Peter gives the prince a royal shiner. Impressed by his courage, the Queen Mother (Vera Lewis) orders Peter to impersonate Alexis, who has announced that he will give up his throne if he is forced to marry the contentious Princess Katerina (Una Merkel). Peter and the Princess fall in love, whereupon the petulant Alexis is told to take a hike. Command Performance was one of several interesting films produced by James Cruze for low-budget Tiffany Pictures.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wWj0VEFtl74xzJPCkBKGbRWVoId.jpg", "actors": ["Neil Hamilton (Peter Fedor / Prince Alexis)", "Una Merkel (Princess Katerina)", "Helen Ware (Queen Elinor)", "Albert Gran (King Nicholas)", "Lawrence Grant (Count Vellenburg)", "Thelma Todd (Lydia)", "Vera Lewis (Queen Elizabeth)", "Mischa Auer (Duke Charles)", "Burr McIntosh (Masoch)", "Wilhelm von Brincken (Capt.
