Piglet brings acorns, Pooh brings honey, Owl brings biscuits, Gopher brings lemonade, and Tigger brings ice cream. But then, Rabbit walks in and tells them their Thanksgiving dinner was unacceptable and informs them that a real Thanksgiving dinner includes turkey, cranberry sauce, and pumpkin pie, so Pooh and his friends set out to find those very items.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wdODlaDigA9JIFhbJHSFYTsaaKy.jpg", "actors": ["Brady Bluhm (Christopher Robin (voice))", "Peter Cullen (Eeyore (voice))", "Jim Cummings (Winnie the Pooh / Tigger - singing \n  \n  \n  (voice))", "John Fiedler (Piglet (voice))", "Frankie J.
