In considering soil quality, lack of space and a short growing season challenges rather than obstacles, she offers a wealth of practical growing tips for urban gardeners. By heeding Bowlby's advice, bountiful organic gardens work equally well on apartment balconies, in small or large city lots or in a rural setting.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bIWcn438k4rEkxHhfi8OdsmTZke.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
