She is a wild and free spirit and unconventional for any small and closed communities dominated by old rules. Cain\u00e0 yearns to escape from such a closed atmosphere and the isolated island, so, as an old tune says: \"Somewhere beyond the sea, somewhere, waiting for me\u2026\"; When a boat arrives to the island, she will do her best to flee away from her little oppressing village and experience new adventures in the continent with the help of the boat captain.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y37XadjDKwBIyTaBntVzZ609UV4.jpg", "actors": ["Maria Jacobini (Cain\u00e0)", "Carlo Benetti (Pietro)", "Ida Carloni Talli (La madre)", "Eugenio Duse ()", "Sig.
