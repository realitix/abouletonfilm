He and his wife, Dorothy, live on a farm in the rural mid-west. For some reason, during the season before autumn, things start happening. The first victims are family pets, then wild animals. But it's not until people are injured that the police get involved. The attacker is not human, that's for sure and it needs to be stopped. Then they discover that the wounds have a deadly bacteria and the clock is ticking for those infected. Enter Hanklin's neighbor, Francis Wellman, a Native American who believes she has discovered an ancient antidote. And will they ever find the perpetrator of these horrifying attacks? They do.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/enHJDWMsLIjuoXdieO2r6ea98Ji.jpg", "actors": ["Larry Joe Campbell (Hanklin Purvis)", "Mariann Mayberry (Dorothy Purvis)", "Kimberly Guerrero (Francis Wellman)", "Stacie Hadgikosti (Deputy Samels)", "Tom Cilluffo (Jeshen Purvis)", "Luke Bonczyk (Sam Reynolds)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
