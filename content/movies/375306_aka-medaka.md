Danshun himself was inspired as a little boy to become a rakugoka after seeing the legendary Danshi. He had found his calling. After his resistant parents relented to their son\u2019s pleas, Danshun at age 17 became an apprentice of Danshi, the man dubbed a \u201cwunderkind\u201d and \u201cgenius\u201d of the rakugo world. He soon realized however how hard the training was, and embarked upon a rigorous existence in which he had to deliver newspapers to earn a living. Living with hardship and joys, Danshun and his fellow apprentices would eventually rise in the rakugo world. A resplendent cast comes together to depict the rough and tumble world of a man who loved rakugo above all else and was destined to fulfill a dream.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jRdICR2CmNziDrQ2UljmA5AXFH8.jpg", "actors": ["Kazunari Ninomiya (\u4e8c\u5bab\u548c\u4e5f)", "Takeshi Kitano (\u5317\u91ce\u6b66)", "Gaku Hamada (\u7acb\u5ddd\u5fd7\u3089\u304f)", "Hiroko Yakushimaru (\u836f\u5e08\u4e38\u535a\u5b50)", "Tsurube Sh\u00f4fukutei (\u30ca\u30d3\u30b2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc)", "Tsurube Sh\u00f4fukutei (\u7acb\u5ddd\u95a2\u897f)", "Teruyuki Kagawa (\u7acb\u5ddd\u5fd7\u306e\u8f14)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
