Settling into this interstitial expanse of Shirin Neshat\u2019s Soliloquy (1999), viewers become mediators, with the series of scenes on each screen flowing not past, but through this audience \u2013 asking them, perhaps, to act as witnesses to the ensuing visual dialogue. The titles begin, in English and Persian; then, the sole character appears, clad in black robes and played by Neshat herself. She is looking out of two different windows: one in Albany, New York; the other in Mardin, Turkey, not far from the artist\u2019s native Iran.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
