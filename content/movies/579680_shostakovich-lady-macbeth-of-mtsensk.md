Although one of the mainsprings of the work, the Shakespearean parallel is here bitterly ironic: unlike Lady Macbeth, Katerina Isma\u00eflova who, in the remote reaches of rural 19th century Russia, falls in love with one of her husband\u2019s employees and is finally forced to commit suicide, is less a manipulator than a victim of a violent and patriarchal society. Krzysztof Warlikowski liberates all the subversive power of this scorching and scandalous work, which marked the early years of the Op\u00e9ra Bastille.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/omIVvWVCbzwhZ3gGQq17ZUkhPCA.jpg", "actors": ["Au\u0161rin\u0117 Stundyt\u0117 (Katerina Lvovna Ismailova)", "Pavel Cernoch (Serguei)", "Dmitry Ulyanov (Boris Timofeevich Ismailov)", "Sofija Petrovic (Aksinya)", "John Daszak (Zinovy Borisovich Ismailov)", "Krzysztof Baczyk (A priest)", "Oksana Volkova (Sonyetka)", "Ingo Metzmacher (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
