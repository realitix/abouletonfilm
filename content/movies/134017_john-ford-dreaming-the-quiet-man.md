There is mesmeric archive and rare photographs of the making of the film. The main location of the documentary is Ford\u2019s ancestral homeland of Connemara, on the west coat of Ireland, where his parents were born. We meet Ford\u2019s cousins, the Feeney\u2019s who  tell the story of Ford\u2019s parent\u2019s departure from Ireland after the Great Famine and the young Ford\u2019s return to Ireland in 1922 to visit his cousins the Thornton\u2019s and saw their house being burned down by the infamous Black and Tans. Ford,  under the pretense of scouting locations for a movie,  gave money to the IRA.  We travel to Portland Maine where Ford grew up and went on to become a director in the first bloom of Hollywood. The boy made it good but Ireland was always on his mind.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iRmAp7PgPXN79cfvUXW0HHctbtM.jpg", "actors": ["Gabriel Byrne (Narrator)", "Maureen O'Hara (Herself)", "Peter Bogdanovich (Himself)", "Martin Scorsese (Himself)", "Jim Sheridan (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "B60lTf7LrK8"}
