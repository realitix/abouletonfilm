While peddling naked female flesh was considered indecent in the past, we can see by the examples of today\u00b4s star athletes that skin full of advertising sells better. The same applies to politicians, of course, though in a more subtle way. Advertising on skin as the new indecency!  I consider this film to be a continuation of my previous work with the body as a vehicle for social codes. While in the past it was religion that dictated male and female behaviour, which was also expressed in their physical appearance, business has now assumed this role. Business dictates physical behaviour, physical pressure in its most direct form, and even sets standards for how our bodies are to be represented. Religion no longer prescribes morality, that is now done by the global power of business, with its products and codes. Morality has found a new patron.\u201d \u2013 VALIE EXPORT", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kACB1CLC3mS518GRkxm4wVLPCt8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
