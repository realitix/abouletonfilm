Filmmaker/stonemason. A tower or ruin of remembrance. With each swing of the hammer I cut into the image and the sound rises from the chisel. A rhythm, marked by repetition, and animated by variation; strokes of hammer and fist, resounding in dialogue. In this space which the film creates, emptiness gains a contour strong enough for the spectator to see more than the image \u2013 a space permitting vision in addition to sight.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/11SIXXEPCp6prjkJgnC3uIxLu1V.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [299203, 250320, 315736, 199177], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
