Beloved, sassy Golden Girl Rue McClanahan stars as an unbeloved, depressive stripper who wants to become a movie star but can\u2019t get any roles better than, say \u201cStripper #3\u201d in Mondo Topless. But love is in the air, mingling with LA smog, as Rue falls for assistant junkyard attendee Tony, played by Anthony Vorno (Sweet trash, Jailbait Babysitter).  Surprisingly, things go wrong and one of them turns up dead. There\u2019s plenty of dimly-lit Burlesque dancing on a bare, presumable filthy stage, plus pale, hairy men in tight swimsuits, and drug-laced creepy sex! HOORAY FOR HOLLYWOOD! It\u2019s up to the Film Crew to turn this bleak cautionary tale into a hilarious, um, cautionary tale. Lunch is provided.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kco16DbPMx0g09J99FCAkj2fucG.jpg", "actors": ["Bill Corbett (Himself)", "Michael J.
