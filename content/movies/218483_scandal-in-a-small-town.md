She is not too well thought of as she is nothing of a blushing virgin. But she is far from a whore and brings up her daughter Julie, a high school student, as a loving responsible mother. So, when she becomes aware that Julie's very popular history teacher, Mr Baker, spreads antisemitic ideas among his pupils, Leda Beth decides to ask Mr Baker for an explanation. But she comes up against a wall. Nobody in town - Julie less than all others - wants to support her and it looks as if she will have to bring the Board of Education to court. The trouble is that a school dropout and a tramp of her kind does not count for much compared to the holders of knowledge and of morality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6KhSqlHG8cscgTDtwuuoFNJfkmS.jpg", "actors": ["Raquel Welch (Leda Beth Vincent)", "Ronny Cox (George Baker)", "Frances Lee McCain (Gwendolyn)", "Peter Van Norden (Paul Martin)", "Mickey Jones (Glenn)", "Ernie Lively (Jeremy Travis)", "Christa Denton (Julie Vincent)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
