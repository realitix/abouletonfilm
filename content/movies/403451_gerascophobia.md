Mo does many ridiculous things to avoid growing up. The animation describes his mundane life moments, shows his fears of separation, mortality, taking responsibility and standing out as an independent individual. The ideas were mainly from personal life experience and childhood memories. I focus on childhood anxieties as a means of gaining insight to the anxieties of adults. As we mature, rationality and social pressures inhibit our instinctive responses as we learn to conceal our fears.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kPHmryKWNU2UpgTbg5rS6BWClq0.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
