He just crashed and burned on a simulated flight test, and his friendly examiner has been replaced with the tough-as-nails Harada (Tokito Saburo). On the same plane is cabin attendant Etsuko (Ayase Haruka) who's flying her first international flight and trying hard to not mess up. Elsewhere in the Happy Flight universe, staff are bustling back and forth with various problems and gripes - all to make this ordinary yet fateful flight a safe and happy one.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j6xntDFHLFJqJB0oN0vmDhumX4L.jpg", "actors": ["Seiichi Tanabe (Kazuhiro Suzuki)", "Haruka Ayase (Etsuko Saito)", "Kazue Fukiishi (Mari Tanaka)", "Shinobu Terajima (Reiko Yamazaki)", "Ittoku Kishibe (Shoji Takahashi)", "Noriko Eguchi (Air-traffic Controller)", "Saburo Tokito (Noriyoshi Harada)", "Kumiko Itou (Kaori Matsumoto)", "Tomoko Tabata (Natsumi Kimura)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [113997, 55384, 55382, 130023], "youtube_key": "aoBS1qemBZI"}
