This question is now getting serious attention from scientists who study animal senses. Humans rely on smell, sight, taste, touch and sound; other animals have super-powered versions of these senses, and a few have extra senses we don't have at all. From a dog that seems to use smell to tell time to a dolphin that can \"see\" with its ears, discover how animals use their senses in ways we humans can barely imagine. But it's not just the senses that are remarkable -- it's the brains that process them. NOVA goes into the minds of animals to \"see\" the world in an entirely new way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lvVYAMpScBQeseTVi6THyup5JqX.jpg", "actors": ["Lance Lewman (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
