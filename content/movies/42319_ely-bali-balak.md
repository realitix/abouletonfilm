The movie is about a guy called \"el lembi\" who repeatedly robes his uncle and was put in jail. He then tries to escape and the prison warden (Mohammad Saad too) tries to catch him then an unfortunate accident takes place and a brain transplant surgery takes place the con's brain given to the policeman and a lot of awkward situations arise. The movie has a lot of funny moments, plenty of laughs.the story line is lacking or almost not there , and of course no real plot.If you were looking for a 'no brainer' funny movie i would recommend watching this movie.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bKaYBqaXjcdkwtlbKdiXgu16NoV.jpg", "actors": ["Abla Kamel (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0631\u0629)", "Hassan Hosny (\u0627\u062f\u0647\u0645)", "Mohamed Saad (\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0645\u0628\u064a / \u0631\u064a\u0627\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0641\u0644\u0648\u0637\u064a)", "\u0646\u064a\u0641\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0631 (\u0641\u064a\u062d\u0627\u0621)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [52169, 57004, 57468, 181923], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
