From the outside looking in, they see the single-family home as the locus of the exclusion of the other. It is also unaffordable. They both feel as if they are invisible citizens. They witness how the architectural landscape imposed on the California desert appears as a reversal of nature, where exclusive living, gated communities and segregation go hand in hand. They dream of escape.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m0WzarsvrIVuAcifVbI8orRBVz9.jpg", "actors": ["Archer Martin ()", "Christine Berry ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
