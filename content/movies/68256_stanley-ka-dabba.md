While his class-mates bring their own tiffin-boxes, Stanley does not do so on the pretext that his mother is away. His friends share their food with him, much to the chagrin of the Hindi Teacher: Babubhai Verma, who not only cajoles fellow-teachers, but also virtually forces the children to share their food with him. With extra classes being imposed on both students and teachers, and the recess-breaks being doubled, parents are also forced to pack more food in their children's lunch-boxes. The students continue to share their food with Stanley. Babubhai then warns Stanley that he must get a lunch box if he wants to attend school.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6ivNFQZCg7ZeDtPK900DD4iwPSc.jpg", "actors": ["Partho A.
