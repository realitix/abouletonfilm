A vigorous comment by Jean Cocteau tells us of the sick souls and the sorrows of literary characters and musicians who lived the dream of this city. It is the Venice of Lord Byron, Alfred de Musset, George Sand, d'Annunzio; a Venice made of precious images, palaces reflected in the water, mysterious moonlights, little squares where unhappy lovers wander under the music of Richard Wagner.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Gino Cervi (Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
