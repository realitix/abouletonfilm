A Blutengel-concert is like an audiovisual experience in cinemascope. It was, thus, rather obvious that a documentation of Blutengel\u0092s \u0093Labyrinth\u0094-tour would have to be on DVD.\r Moments of Our LIVEs\u0094 not only makes you relive a show from that tour\u0085 it also documents the \u0093tour feeling\u0094 in conveying the atmosphere of the places where the songs were recorded.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oP7s93rz7WVSPct8hxys3W2gbO0.jpg", "actors": ["Chris Pohl (Chris Pohl)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
