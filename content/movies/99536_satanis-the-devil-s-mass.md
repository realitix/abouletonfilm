He and his Church of Satan are shown performing a black mass, in which a nude woman serves as an altar and a boa constrictor wraps itself around a naked witch. Newsreel footage is included in which LaVey's neighbors are interviewed about the lion which he kept in his house until complaints resulted in the animal's removal to a zoo. The ideology of the Church of Satan is discussed--guilt rejection, sexual freedom, and self-indulgence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nte1sPwit49STy5TdJMopML4gwo.jpg", "actors": ["Isaac Bonewits (Himself)", "Anton LaVey (Himself)", "Diane LaVey (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
