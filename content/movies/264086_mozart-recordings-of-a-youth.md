The film covers Mozart's creative output from ages seven to 20. Compositions written after the film's time frame are also heard on the omnipresent soundtrack. As a bonus to music purists, the original orchestrations -- and original instruments -- are utilized.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g4Xg2kEJuAbtl4mhWaaNqIIOBOQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
