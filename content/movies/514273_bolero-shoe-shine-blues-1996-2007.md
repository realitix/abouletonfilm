The animation consists solely of a shoe shine: hands move a length of cloth around and across a shoe, syncopated with a minimalistic melody and lyrics written by the artist. Its swaying, repetitive quality draws the audience into a simple and elegant comparison of artistic labor, in the form of drawing, to the marginalized service economy of a global city.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c4N38nTprbEcM3PtYbmto3na3kh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
