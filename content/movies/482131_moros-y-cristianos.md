This one through the blackmail puts the name of the young woman in question. The festival of Moros y cristianos, in which both are captains, will serve to unmask the young man, save the girl's name and redo the happiness of his marriage.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Clara Artells ()", "J\u00falio del Cerro ()", "Anita Giner ()", "Concha Gorg\u00e9 ()", "Leopoldo Pitarch ()", "Luisa Pla ()", "Fernando Priego ()", "Ram\u00f3n Serneguet ()", "Arturo Terol ()", "Francisco Villasante ()", "Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngeles ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
