It is based on the successful theatrical play (rhyming pastoral romance) by Dimitrios Koromilas, who draws his inspiration from a poem by Giannis Zalokostas \"I fell in love with a shepherdess\". The setting is Greece, a rural country in the middle of the 19th century. A landlord, Mitros, gives Kroustallo a golden cross as a gift to show her his tender feelings. He doesn't know, however, that she is already in love with Liakos, a destitute young shepherd to whom Mitros owes his life - in the past he had saved him from drowning in the river. The cross around the neck of the shepherdess causes fights between the two men, while Mitros asks Kroustallo's hand from her mother, Mrs. Stathaina, who had been his childhood love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xUbmVwC4lHH11jD5eKJfn4QwGes.jpg", "actors": ["Dimitris Tsakiris (Mitros)", "Nina Afentaki (Kroustallo)", "Manos Katrakis (Liakos)", "Sofia Dorival (Stathaina)", "Giorgos Batis ()", "Dimitris Kotzias ()", "Aimilia Marikou ()", "Meropi Rozan ()", "Panagis Svoronos ()", "Michalis Vlahopoulos ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
