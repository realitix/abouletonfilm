The young new French Canadian teacher faces various challenges and interesting characters, and finds herself in a controversial relationship with a Metis teenage student. This is one of my favorite movies, and it should have gotten a lot more exposure than it did (the fate of many good Canadian movies).  It should appeal to those who enjoy romantic historical dramas."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
