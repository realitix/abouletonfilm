After failing even at that, his 34-year-old English teacher Akemi convinces him that he should instead move to Tokyo with her and become a lawyer on her dime. Unfortunately, Akemi doesn\u2019t have quite as much money as she leads Norio to believe, and has to secretly get a job at a karaoke bar under the guise of \u201cgoing to the salon\u201d. Meanwhile, she continuously prods her somewhat dimwitted student to work harder toward her manufactured goal of him becoming a lawyer. Although Norio is falling in love with Akemi, he\u2019s not all that interested in studying, and matters only get worse when he discovers his benefactor\u2019s secret source of income.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3EoAhoUhZOzll88UwWR9FleBrkm.jpg", "actors": ["Toshiki Fujikawa ()", "Sachiko Katsumata ()", "Tomoya Maeno ()", "Maki Meguro ()", "Ryu Morioka ()", "Hiroshi Sakuma ()", "Shunta Watanabe ()", "Ayako Yoshitani ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
