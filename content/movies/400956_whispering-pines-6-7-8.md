The combination of these activities helps Cynthia to solve the puzzle of self-discovery. Cynthia is confronted with a distorted mirror image that slips between the grotesque and the exotic, depending on her posture. While Cynthia performs her nose-pore cleaning routine in front of the mirror, a sphinx appears and sings a song from the animated movie \"The Last Unicorn,\" which laments becoming a woman. Fuelled by the sugar-free drink Crystal Light, Cynthia methodically fills a vase with alchemical home decorating items. Once her project is completed, Cynthia is again left to dwell in her thoughts. Suddenly a ladder grows out of the vase. Cynthia climbs the ladder and, through a trap door, enters an ecstatic rave complete with a techno remix of the Crystal Light commercial music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ndMj2wMpXRUNukvLl3u5Kiv9Ujd.jpg", "actors": ["Shana Moulton (Cynthia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
