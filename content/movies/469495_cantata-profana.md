It takes the form of an amphitheatre of video projections presenting a new musical composition, created in partnership with British composer Orlando Gough, artist and musician Tim Kerr and six grindcore vocalists. It interweaves extreme metal music culture with classical choral traditions; the intense sounds and body movements of the vocalists, together with the backdrop of the out-dated German Democratic Republic radio studio in which the piece was \ufb01lmed, all contribute to the atmosphere of this unique and enveloping work.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
