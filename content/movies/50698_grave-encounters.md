In fact the only reason I saw it at all was because of a recommendation I got online when I posed the question \"Where there any good movies in 2011\"?\r\n\r\nI didn't love _Grave Encounters_. But I am, to my surprise, super glad that I watched it. If more Found Footage Horror films were like this one, maybe I wouldn't detest the genre. Seriously, although I had a number of problems with the movie, I'd still put this one up closer to _The Last Exorcism_ and _The Blair Witch Project_ than to the usual dreck the genre offers.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"}], "recommandations_id": [134366, 84348, 72571, 38358], "youtube_key": "Qn3fDvUXFps"}
