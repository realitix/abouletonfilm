He then discovers a piano that washed ashore, and begins playing it. The animals come around; a gorilla, after playing a 4-hands piece with his feet, destroys the piano. Mickey runs away and accidentally wakes a lion. The lion chases Mickey to a stream, where he jumps onto a rock that turns out to be right next to a crocodile.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c3x3s5rTbnUspujM31sI8LTArBo.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [174303, 174508, 161614, 156461], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
