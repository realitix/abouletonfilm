Here the camera is not a passive observer, nor is it used as a surveillance device. Rather, the camera in Park Film, like the passers by who trigger its shutter, is an active participant in the interaction between a park and the city which surrounds it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m4HpHcsBHmdY5ikSWPMD82qepPn.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
