Cowboy and Maria have independently landed in Port Moresby, negotiating ways to survive urban life in a city ranked as one of the most dangerous in the world. Cowboy is an ex-raskol (urban bandit) and Maria an inhabitant of a squatter settlement. Unemployed and with a jail record, Cowboy has constructed an electric guitar out of scrap materials and plays on street corners. Maria lives an equally precarious existence, cultivating a seasonal garden in an urban settlement inflamed by frustration and intertribal conflicts. Far from being third world victims, they go about their daily lives with humour and imagination, rising to the challenge of enormous cultural upheaval.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dfm5ivWG88mEBdOXKwuWkeUgYyl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
