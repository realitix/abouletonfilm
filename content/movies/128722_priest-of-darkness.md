Through a series of intrigues, Kochiyama, Naojiro (who becomes Hirotaro for the film), Ichinijo, and Hirotaro's sister Onami (played by a young Hara Setsuko) all pretty much have the worst day or two of their lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oW6HcXfRYSaeB5Ajptktv5BwIKn.jpg", "actors": ["Ch\u00f4j\u00fbr\u00f4 Kawarasaki (Kochiyama Soshun)", "Kan'emon Nakamura (Kaneko Ichinojo)", "Shizue Kawarazaki (Oshizu)", "Setsuko Hara (Onami)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [72479], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
