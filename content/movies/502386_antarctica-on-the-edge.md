It is a huge land covered with ice as thick as three miles, seemingly invulnerable, cold and dark for eight months of the year. Yet Antarctica is also a fragile place, home to an incredible variety of life along its edges, arguably the most stunning, breathtaking and still-pristine place on earth. The one constant is that it is constantly changing, every season, every day, every hour. I've been fortunate to travel to Antarctica many times; most recently with 3D cameras, a first for the continent. The result is our new film, Antarctica: On the Edge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8FPap12NOMDP15isJ03XOt0GdE6.jpg", "actors": ["Tilda Swinton (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
