He dominated the 2008 season, proving his skills in all conditions and on every terrain. Loeb wasn't the only record-breaker: Title rival Mikko Hirvonen, who headed the Championship battle early in the season. Ford team-mate Jari-Matti Latvala also claimed his place in history when he became the youngest person ever to win a WRC event.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hm35dtAfQVQn45KZ553X9O4vO4r.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
