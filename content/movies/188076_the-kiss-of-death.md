Mike Leigh directed 'this whimsical, made-for-television tale about Trevor, an unusually bashful mortician's assistant', whose moods and personality really make up the subject of the film.  Trevor is an extremely shy undertaker's assistant. He always tags along with his good friend Ronnie, when he goes to the pub with his girlfriend Sandra. Sandra introduces Trevor to her more forward friend Linda. Linda has a difficult time getting Trevor to go out with her, but she finally gets him to go to a disco; he won't dance, so Linda dances with Ronnie.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3KNRYvhvhEoiky08Bs0tadYQwgO.jpg", "actors": ["David Threlfall (Trevor)", "Kay Adshead (Linda)", "Angela Curran (Sandra)", "John Wheatley (Ronnie)", "Clifford Kershaw (Mr Gartside)", "Marlene Sidaway (Christine)", "Eileen Denison (Mrs Ball)", "Brian Pollitt (Doctor)", "Christine Moore (Mrs Bodger)", "Frank McDermott (Mr Bodger)", "Phillip Ryland (Froggy)", "Karen Petrie (WPC)", "Elizabeth Ann Ogden (Bridesmaid)", "Elizabath Hauck (Shoe Shop Customer)", "Pamela Austin (Trevor's Mum)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [265640], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
