The movie is an adaption from a Norwegian children's novel by Kari Vinje, and is the first feature film of renowned Norwegian actor Dennis Storh\u00f8i and also stars 80's pop idol Morten Harket in a minor role. Kamilla and the Thief was a huge success in Norway, selling half a million tickets (in a country of 4.5 million people). It was so popular that a sequel was made, Kamilla and the Thief II, which was released the year after. In 2005 both movies were digitally restored and released on DVD.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yLpsH2RFhdCW1rotDHird1URM31.jpg", "actors": ["Veronika Flaat (Kamilla)", "Dennis Storh\u00f8i (Sebastian)", "Agnete G.
