The short contact with family brings Mort back to what are left of his senses and he returns to the last home he remembers in Chicago. His sister Eileen lives in their family home now with her sixteen year old son, Abe. Her older son Moo, the now missing nephew, helped spark Mort's return to his family. Three, four, five weeks pass as Mort waits outside his home and makes a tenuous re-entry into family life. Abe dreams of a sailboat and distant horizons. He saves money and sees an advertisement for the Kathy II. He and his friend calculate a way to buy the vessel from two unscrupulous rogues who make ends meet wholesaling liquor and operating a sometime boatyard.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aMXZxlO2ZQoDRfGGvPUxGHpW3QR.jpg", "actors": ["Dana Delany (Eileen)", "John Malkovich (Mort)", "John Goodman (Mr. Fletcher)", "Jacob Zachar (Abe)", "Jim Ortlieb (Morley)", "Brian Deneen (David)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "kV9J0ZLSdHk"}
