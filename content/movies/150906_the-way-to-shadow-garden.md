A solitary man in coat and tie enters an apartment that may be a converted garage. It's midnight. He appears agitated and distraught. He throws a glass of water in his face and laughs. He takes off the coat and tie. His moods swing. He stares at a light bulb. He removes his shirt. He lights a cigarette. He looks at a book. He does something drastic and self-destructive. He opens doors to a garden that we see as a film's negative. We see his face as if peering around a plant. The garden doors close behind him.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4V1uAmH3ig2o4od5zRoRmqwepGR.jpg", "actors": ["Walter Newcomb ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [283491, 268617, 189591, 189941], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
