The remarkable counter-tenor Cencic, who dedicates himself to the revival and performance of the music of the 18th century, demonstrates once more that Baroque singing can be both technically brilliant and at the same time modern and emotionally engaging. His enchanting staging of Arminio is the revival of the heroic story. When premiered in 1737 at Londons Covent Garden Arminio strangely received only six performances, despite being praised as a miracle and in every respect excellent and vastly pleasing by contemporaries.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9aAyMA6YNwu9w1lMQCWwgTR4DO3.jpg", "actors": ["Gaia Petrone ()", "Lauren Snouffer ()", "Juan Sancho ()", "Pavel Kudinov ()", "Max Emanuel Cencic ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
