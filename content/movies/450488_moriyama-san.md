Introduced in the intimacy of this experimental microcosm which redefines completely the common sense of domestic life, Ila B\u00eaka recounts in a very spontaneous and personal way the unique personality of the owner: a urban hermit living in a small archipelago of peace and contemplation in the heart of Tokyo.

Moriyama-San, the first film about noise music, acrobatic reading, silent movies, fireworks and Japanese architecture!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/doQsaQD25bzsYE6Xzrta7nbyyID.jpg", "actors": ["Yasuo Moriyama ()", "Ila B\u00eaka ()", "Satoshi Takae ()", "Nao Taniguchi ()", "Kazuto Kimura ()", "Mayumi Yamamoto ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
