The film features some very creative imagery, a groovy 70's jazz score, and very little spoken dialogue. It's a story about a dog named Joe that falls in love with a rose and protects it from a mean spirited crow. There's some energetic Fritz Freeling style action. There's also some unexpectedly grim tragedy, not including the anticipated outcome, which does occur as expected.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gnJ7vpo2zURzl1b2qHNp8AgcLQE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
