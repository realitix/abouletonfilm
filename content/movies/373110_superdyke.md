They march through City Hall, usurp the bus lines, demythologiz the consumer mentality at Macy's (to the recorded astonishment of casual shoppers), and wander through the erotic art museum. Barbara's frenetic handheld lens catches the startled reactions and the glee of the participants. SUPERDYKE has a home-movie quality to it, but its committed and loose moments in the playground confirm its comic rationale.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eaeMz2qT3DKVNaYwjUS4SSUGegK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
