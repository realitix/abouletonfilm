Rod Cameron stars as frontier scout Tim Clay, assigned to guide a wagon train through Indian territory. Clay knows that he's in for a lot of trouble because of the treaty-violating activities of white criminals Pickett (Morris Ankrum) and Keane (Douglas Kennedy). Fortunately for the hero, Pickett and Keane double-cross each other somewhere along the line, weakening their ability to foment an all-out Indian attack. Jane Nigh co-stars as the in-the-dark daughter of one of the villains. Fort Osage was produced by Walter Mirisch, who later graduated to such big-budgeters as West Side Story and The Great Escape.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ugFDL5KslmKDfsxYUGPTs0kW9D1.jpg", "actors": ["Rod Cameron (Tom Clay)", "Jane Nigh (Ann Pickett)", "Morris Ankrum (Arthur Pickett)", "Douglas Kennedy (George Keane)", "John Ridgely (Henry Travers)", "William Phipps (Nathan Goodspeed)", "Myron Healey (Martin Christensen)", "I.
