His large family, particularly his scheming Uncle Jonas, would rather dance and romance than earn a living. When Jonas loses the family plantation in a cockfight, Chester saves the day by towing in a large ship abandoned at sea and claiming the salvage. But opening a joint bank account in the name of the Tuttle clan may not have been a wise decision.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ouczZxA1oKGR8uDKrmyYwneTJ4r.jpg", "actors": ["Charles Laughton (Jonas)", "Jon Hall (Chester)", "Peggy Drake (Tamara)", "Victor Francen (Dr. Blondin)", "Gene Reynolds (Ru)", "Florence Bates (Emily)", "Curt Bois (Jensen)", "Adeline De Walt Reynolds (Mama Ruau)", "Mala (Nat)", "Grace Lem (Woman in Dress Shop)", "Jack Carr (Rapoti)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
