Giselle Pascal stars as Boucher, who is first seen in 1930, leaving her millinery shop behind in favor of the wild blue yonder. Though the world of aviation was still essentially an all-male one (despite England's Amy Johnson and America's Amelia Earhart), Boucher perseveres, eventually breaking all existing male and female speed and height records. A bit slow on the uptake in the dramatic scenes, the film soars (no pun intended) during the aerial sequences. Horizons san Fin was the winner of the Catholic Award at the 1953 Cannes Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5MvnAAgB7T46JFwg3EEknQdNFcR.jpg", "actors": ["Giselle Pascal ()", "Jean Chevrier ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
