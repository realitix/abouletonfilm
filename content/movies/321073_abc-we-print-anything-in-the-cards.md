In ABC - We print anything - In the cards (1977) Schneemann documented dreams, advice and conversations relating to her shifting relationships. She collated 315 numbered cards, containing both text and photographic imagery, which she photographed from her domestic life. Schneemann (the \u2018C\u2019 in ABC) analyses her complex set of experiences separating from \u2018A\u2019 (artist Anthony McCall) while drawing closer to \u2018B\u2019 (publisher Bruce McPherson).
