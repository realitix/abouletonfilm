A family of villagers moves up in the world - to the county seat. Dad works as a butcher at a meatpacking plant, mom is a checker at a supermarket. The daughter is at odds with her homeroom teacher, while the son - a vegetarian, anarchist, and avid pothead - is apprenticing as a butcher to please his father. The kid's in hot water with both his forewoman and the police. But dad isn't much of an example, letting himself be tempted by the charms of a lovely young butcher. However much mom tries - visiting the beauty parlor, her psychologist, or even the confessional - her husband shows his interest by moving out. Mom plots revenge. And somehow an imp gets mixed up in it all", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vxm9azVoSI9MB0dfOyZq4UJcHNY.jpg", "actors": ["Bolek Pol\u00edvka (Father)", "Eva Holubov\u00e1 (Mother)", "Tom\u00e1\u0161 Vorel ml.
