An insightful account of a reserved man who paradoxically created rapturous, expressive cinema. Colleagues and historians, including Claudia Cardinale, describe the complicated way that Kalatozov made such radical works within the restrictions of film-making in the Soviet state.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9iK6JHBI8BHobLfs6JGjTLMf2Ms.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
