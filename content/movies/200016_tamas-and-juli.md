Tamas a young coal miner has an eye for the girls but is too bashful to ask for a date. Juli is a teacher in charge of a kindergarten. She too has yearnings for love but fears showing the feelings bubbling within her. The quiet and tender moments the lovers spend together are contrasted with the overpowering gigantic and noisy coal mine with its dirty metal trucks and endless rubber conveyor belts. There is an atmosphere of impending danger within the mine.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/svY8Q0pmnj7irKAIjWkJr2Pcic9.jpg", "actors": ["M\u00e1rta Angyal (Juli)", "D\u00e1vid J\u00e1nosi (Tam\u00e1s)", "Gloria Ormandlaky (Panni)", "Gy\u00f6rgy Bark\u00f3 ()", "Csaba Czene ()", "Ferenc Elek ()", "Jozsef Pongracz ()", "Andr\u00e1s T\u00f3th ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
