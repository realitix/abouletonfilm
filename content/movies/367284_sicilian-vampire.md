Instead, what he got was a night he will never forget. Once there, Sonny is bitten by a bat released from a container of bananas they brought up to the lodge. The bat takes a vicious bite of Sonny's neck and then flies off into the night. From that moment on Sonny is entrusted with powers beyond that of any mortal - supersonic hearing, enhanced sight, and superhuman strength - even the ability to speak to the dead. Because of these heightened senses Sonny now feels a responsibility to right the wrongs in his life, and protect those he loves. At first, he resists these new found powers but in the end he welcomes his fate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b0GOtcxHfL8Ys6G1dGettLQuo7n.jpg", "actors": ["James Caan (Professor Bernard Issaacs)", "Daryl Hannah (Carmelina Trafficante)", "Paul Sorvino (Jimmy Scambino)", "Robert Loggia (Santino Trafficante Sr.)", "Armand Assante (Vince)", "Robert Davi (Big Sal - The Don)", "Michael Par\u00e9 (Sammy)", "Eric Roberts (Detective Louis Marshall)", "Daniel Baldwin (Vito)", "Tony Nardi (Little Anthony (Sonny's wise guy))", "Frank D'Angelo (Santino Trafficante Jr. (Santo))", "Phil Esposito (Philly (friend of Santo's at Don Giovanni's))", "Art Hindle (Detective Domenic Durpray)", "Ellen Dubin (Vince's Mistress)", "Tony Rosato (Tony Rosato \t... \t Maitre D' at Don Giovanni's)", "George Chuvalo (The Don's Bodyguard)", "Spider Jones (The Don's Bodyguard)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "32QqR4TwZk8"}
