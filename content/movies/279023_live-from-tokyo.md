The documentary looks at Tokyo's music culture as a reflection of Japanese society and in relation to international music culture. Tokyo's reputation for an overwhelming variety of global information, media-saturated urban environment and cutting edge innovation, makes it the perfect sample for addressing a new outlook on music culture as it explores this eccentric music culture set within a modern Japanese megalopolis.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z9QjUqgBHWHbJ3IeYyCRw4LLzdR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
