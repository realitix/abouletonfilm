To complicate matters, a blackmailer on board apparently knows she is not who she claims to be - and he has his sights set on other passengers with secrets of their own. In the meantime an escaped killer has stowed away under someone else's identity, and is killing again to cover his tracks; five international police detectives on board are heading the investigation to find him. When evidence points to the princess and bandleader, they must find the killer themselves - before he finds them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f9uOZcH5hSlQGPTERkPjSlCVxhZ.jpg", "actors": ["Carole Lombard (Princess Olga / Wanda Nash)", "Fred MacMurray (King Mantell)", "Douglass Dumbrille (Lorel)", "Alison Skipworth (Lady Gertrude)", "George Barbier (Captain Nicholls)", "William Frawley (Benton)", "Porter Hall (Darcy)", "Lumsden Hare (Cragg)", "Sig Ruman (Steindorf)", "Mischa Auer (Morevitch)", "Bradley Page (The Stranger)", "Tetsu Komai (Kawati)", "George Chandler (Film Man (uncredited))", "Jean De Briac (French Baggage Official (uncredited))", "Eddie Dunn (Reporter (uncredited))", "Harry Hayden (Master of Ceremonies (uncredited))", "Gladden James (Ship's Official (uncredited))", "Edward Keane (Chief Purser (uncredited))", "Milburn Stone (American Reporter (uncredited))", "Ellinor Vanderveer (Ship's Passenger at Concert (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [106826], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
