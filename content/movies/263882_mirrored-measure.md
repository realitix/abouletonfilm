The older woman ceremoniously lays a table \u2013 she repeatedly spreads a cloth and smoothes it out. The table is set and glasses and jug filled with water. A balanced and controlled ritual follows in which the jug is passed round and water is repeatedly sipped. Water becomes the lens through which we see and the medium through which the protagonists connect. The sense of connectivity is abruptly severed when the first glass tumbles.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fW52JKJBHu25gnokvdcnTt9yAwW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
