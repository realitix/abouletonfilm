I think I was 9 or 10 years old.\r\n\r\nI have been thinking about this film for a very looong time, not knowing what the title was. Like I would just randomly think of this movie sometimes. This film made an impact when I was a child, I don\u2019t know why but I\u2019ve never forgotten this!\r\n\r\nSome of the things that I remembered and stood out:\r\n\r\n* Island of Sardinia - of course as a child, it was weird that they lived in a town that sounded like sardines\r\n\r\n* The food they ate - I always thought it was chocolate with fish! (sardines? lol)\r\n\r\n* Name of the kid Tottoi - sounded like tutoy which meant breast in Bisaya language (my mother\u2019s from Davao :)\r\n\r\nSeals! children friends with animals - of course i loved it as a kid!Don\u2019t even remember the story that much but now I can watch it again, after 15-20 years? haha i want to know why this movie made such an impact in my early years.  I guess it was also because I remember watching this with my family ^_^"}], "recommandations_id": []}
