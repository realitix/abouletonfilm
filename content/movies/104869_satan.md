In the Russian film \"Satan,\" the devil is a delicately handsome young man whose murderous opportunism is too easy to understand. While the film registers shock at its protagonist's absolute amorality, it also presents him as part of a bitterly divided and pessimistic culture. The world of \"Satan\" is one in which nothing really works, and therefore anything goes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6TbSoLImMpL2qBFFJwflQogKU5P.jpg", "actors": ["Sergey Kupriyanov (Vitaliy)", "Svetlana Bragarnik (Alyona Pavlovna)", "Veniamin Malochevskiy (Andrey Korshunov)", "Anatoliy Aristov (Vitaliy's grandfather)", "Armenak Nazikyan (Ruben)", "Mikhail Starodubov (Genrikh)", "Maria Averbach (Vera)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
