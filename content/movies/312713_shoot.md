No\u00e9\u2019s experimental camera placement puts us in the 360\u00b0 point of view of the soccer ball. We roll and fly, the ground and the sky whirling in an unanchored sphere of vision, our only points of reference being the kids who will happily kick us again.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sQwV04aPctsvshE15uVZaRfCrzM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
