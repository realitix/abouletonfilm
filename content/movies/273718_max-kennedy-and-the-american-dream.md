Hunting down illegal immigrants, the Minutemen live a gritty existence in the desert. They do it from a belief that they are at the frontline of a war to save their country. Yet within Max lies a great conflict: a sympathy for the Mexicans. Casting a penetrating light on the US-Mexico border issue, Max's story is a telling insight into human trafficking, first-world poverty and right- wing hate politics. -  Li'l Dog, Gadget, Max Kennedy", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wsAk5MNHkLxjMt8jUTwpUMlvkC2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
