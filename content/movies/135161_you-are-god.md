The fact-based film directed by Leszek Dawid charts the relentless struggle for success of Paktofonika, against the backdrop of crumbling traditional values in dreary 90s Silesia. The contradictory ideals of hiphop - the rebellious, edgy lyrics against the \u2018system\u2019 juxtaposed with the money and  fame sought by the artists - are superbly captured in this dark, unforgettable drama.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h8ryaAYqeENW1oN8eJ9sxhNIwkM.jpg", "actors": ["Marcin Kowalczyk (Magik)", "Dawid Ogrodnik (Rahim)", "Tomasz Schuchardt (Fokus)", "Arkadiusz Jakubik (Gustaw Zarzycki)", "Marcin Doroci\u0144ski (Manager)", "Przemys\u0142aw Bluszcz (Magik's father)", "Halina Bednarz (Magik's mother)", "Magdalena Kacprzak (Magda)", "El\u017cbieta Karkoszka (Fokus's grandma)", "Miroslaw Neinert (Justyna's father)", "Piotr Nowak (Kozak)", "Katarzyna Wajda (Justyna Luszcz)", "Malgorzata Zajaczkowska (Gra\u017cyna)", "Jacek Beler (Ada\u015b)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [36415, 284717, 18575, 24769], "youtube_key": "BkMDaVh3kOQ"}
