It comprised a huge crew to bring its story to life. Saschka commented; 'I wanted to create something that visually felt unique and different to most of the other stuff that\u2019s out there. This had 2 sides \u2013 the first was to really be true to original designs in CG - because so often the final result is nowhere near the beauty of an original design. The second thing was to be bold with our light, colour and shading.'", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bbZKMAlZpjt1aNFU95jBHu24OPy.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
