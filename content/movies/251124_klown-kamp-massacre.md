Humiliated on graduation night, Edwin viciously murdered the entire camp before vanishing into legend. Now, despite the warnings of the town drunk, old man Bonzo has reopened the ranch and a new class of clowns have unwittingly signed up. When their die-hard instructor Sgt. Funnybone (Miguel Martinez, The Donor Conspiracy) is found dead in a puddle of cream pie and blood, the curriculum changes from comedy to survival! Edwin slashes, stabs, strangles, and disembowels the clowns while laughing insanely at his own bad jokes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mSIKSiGEBkQkdCiPsiHsPxseLIs.jpg", "actors": ["Jared Herholtz (Edwin)", "Ross Kelly (Philbert)", "Lloyd Kaufman ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
