This 10-minute music video follows the parallel journeys of the Dorothy character in each adaptation as they both get whisked away in the same tornado, land in their respective versions of Oz, and follow their own yellow brick road. Their stories are interwoven as the two classic versions are combined through their well-loved scores, and sung by some of the greatest voices on Broadway.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/avo3zx8U1auJYDJE4d8WBOwwslY.jpg", "actors": ["Kate Rockwell (Dorothy)", "Brynn Williams (Dorothy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
