You loved Arabesque, but with Lebanon you get the real thing - and one of the most amazing movies of the year. Collin O'Neal and his film crew hired superstar Fran\u00e7ois Sagat to go on a trip to Lebanon to film this stunning movie just weeks before war broke out. Other than Fran\u00e7ois and Collin, the cast consists of guys from Lebanon and other countries of the region. None of them have ever made movies before, and most will never be seen in film again. This is the real deal - hot Arabian studs performing amazing sex. The fucking in this movie is over-the-top, and Collin O'Neal demonstrates again that he is a fantastic director of gay erotica.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vfjHNKelZzFupJGxjRfgrK1gYsh.jpg", "actors": ["Fran\u00e7ois Sagat ()", "Youssef Assad ()", "Martin Mazza ()", "Collin O'Neal ()", "Sayid ()", "Jacko ()", "Marco ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
