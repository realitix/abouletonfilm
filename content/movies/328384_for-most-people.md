The original idea was to get Motorpsycho to Olavsfestdagene, and the result was a powerful and spectacular music experience. In the centre of events there was St\u00e5le Storl\u00f8kken\u2019s handling the Steinmeyer organ in Nidaros Cathedral, together with Pekka Stokke\u2019s visual art. When rock meets classical music, it often turns into a clich\u00e9, but this has turned into a grand and spectacular music experience, due to the band and choir.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dNBCqWWJClfpWRQRrXjEVzgOcz4.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
