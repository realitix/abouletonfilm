Helene Alving (Lesley Manville) leads an outwardly contented life. It is the eve of the 10th anniversary of her husband's death, and she is about to open an orphanage as a memorial to him. To mark this occasion, her bohemian painter son Oswald (Jack Lowden) has returned from Paris. Helene plans to take the opportunity to reveal the truth to Oswald about his father. But the ghosts of the past erupt during an eventful evening, bringing the facade of civilised family life crashing down. Richard Eyre's production of Henrik Ibsen's coruscating masterpiece exploring the malign consequences of buried secrets and lies was universally acclaimed by the critics. It was also nominated for five Olivier Awards. This HD recording was captured at Trafalgar Studios during the play's strictly limited West End season.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7eET216aepQ7IvuMvemkGUWSzLI.jpg", "actors": ["Lesley Manville (Helene Alving)", "Jack Lowden (Oswald Alving)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
