A professor that talked about anything but literature, Cacaso fulfilled notebooks not only with poems but also reflections, drawings and collages, immersed in the purest multimedia expression, long before the internet. He also approached to music and became a lyricist and partner of songwriters such as Elton Medeiros, Edu Lobo, Francis Hime, Sueli Costa and Joyce.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1Bzhm1eE472AwroPNvZCHp3IP2f.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
