Their post-bop music is generally funky (although \"Freefall\" is an uptempo cooker) and sometimes a bit bombastic yet is never predictable. Trumpeter Randy Brecker and tenor saxophonist Michael Brecker take many fiery solos while also sounding warm on ballads. They are supported by a particularly strong rhythm section. In addition, the WDR Big Band contributes 14 horns and a guitar to accompany the core group.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1U8woLPqsvUpisIzT9E1VTG3dbX.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Brecker ()", "Randy Brecker ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
