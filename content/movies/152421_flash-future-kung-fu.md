Eddy Ko is the maverick star pupil of an honorable school who secretly engages in underground \"Black Boxing\" bouts, a black market sport off limits to the school. The ambitious X-Gang, a bloodthirsty neo-Nazi-like organization, plots to take care of Ko and his friends and take over the city with their army of mind-controlled zombie soldiers. In true Hong Kong fashion, it boils down to a showdown of champions, and this one takes place in a boxing ring in an eerily empty warehouse with video coverage broadcasting the event all over.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bPtcwwjBI6PPSZb0YkN4AqH1Dwv.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Wang Lung-Wei (Ah Wei)", "Eddy Ko (Master Lau)", "Ray Lui (Student)", "Lam Hoi-Ling (Nazi woman)", "Yuen Tin-Wan (Nazi woman)", "San Kuai (Doctor)", "Mak Wai-Cheung (Student)", "Steve Mak Fei-Hung (Assassin)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
