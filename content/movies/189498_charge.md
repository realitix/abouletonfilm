The movie follows several teams to the world's first zero-emissions grand prix on the Isle of Man \u2013 the most demanding and deadly circuit on the planet \u2013 in 2009 and on their return in 2010, 2011, and 2012.  For the visionaries, it's history. For the petrol-heads it's blasphemy. What's racing without the sound and fury of internal combustion engines? CHARGE is about the future. It's about change. It's about the dream of a clean, green world. It's about the dream of winning.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6ubEhBvsdDr8wWIYrzoqI23kFhy.jpg", "actors": ["Ewan McGregor (Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "s-8dFbvh_lY"}
