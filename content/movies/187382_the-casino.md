He informs beautiful proprietress Miss Cui (Lily Ho Li-li) that he actually came there for her and reveals himself as her betrothed, Luo Tianguang. The couple wed, but their bliss is interrupted when Luo agrees to help old friend Lun Liu (Chin Feng) defeat crooked gambler Hao Lishan (Shih Kien), who uses rigged dice. Anxious to avenge his humiliation, Hao tries various means to get revenge and enlists the aid of Captain Fan (Fan Mui-sang), who gets kickbacks from the various gambling outlets in the area. However, Luo\u2019s incredible skill with dice and superior martial arts abilities allow him to dodge these threats. On top of this, Luo decides to permanently close his and Miss Cui\u2019s casino and \"use gambling to stop gambling,\" a pledge that makes him even more of a threat to Hao and the corrupt officials who benefit from the status quo.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3RawSgGRVExsJCNXaNSsITfEUgE.jpg", "actors": ["Lily Ho Li-Li ()", "Elliot Ngok ()", "Chin Feng ()", "Chiang Nan ()", "Fan Mei-Sheng ()", "Tang Ti ()", "Lee Pang-Fei ()", "Sek Kin ()", "Wu Ma ()", "Gam Tin-Chue (Gambler)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
