For a chance to study with the charismatic Jacques d'Amboise at the National Dance Institute. His philosophy--that creativity exists within everyone and that trying one's best ensures success--forms the foundation of a unique dance program. This documentary chronicles one school-year-long program including initial auditions, rehearsals, and the creation of an exclusive \"SWAT\" team, and culminates in an amazing, year-end performance at New York's Felt Forum. D'Amboise's enthusiasm is infectious--children, parents, teachers, professional dancers and musicians, and even local law enforcement officers find themselves involved in his productions. This Academy Award-winning documentary details the inspiring story of how one talented dancer's vision flourished into a coveted New York City dance program.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/a1tj8QW1A8br6pgd6C3Al7ppete.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
