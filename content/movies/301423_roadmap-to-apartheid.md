Narrated by Alice Walker (author of The Color Purple), Roadmap to Apartheid is as much a historical document of the rise and fall of apartheid in South Africa, as it is a film about why many Palestinians feel they are living in an apartheid system today, and why an increasing number of people around the world agree with them. While not perfect, the apartheid analogy is a useful framework by which to educate people on the complex issues facing Israelis and Palestinians.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yx2UtXt4wYPzgH1Hd7b6NQy63sb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
