He's a battle-scarred undercover cop, working in a universe where nothing seems to add up. It\u2018s Seattle\u2018s notorious Chinatown corridor, where women look like men, everyone has a hidden agenda, and anything that looks like salvation will probably pump you full of lead. When his partner is gunned down in a drug bust gone awry, Johnson is suspended for insubordination. But his thirst for the killer\u2018s trail remains at a lever pitch, especially when he meets Mai Lei (Gina Lim), the sexy assistant to an enigmatic preacher connected with murder. She's everything that Johnson wants; a pleasure-seeking jaguar who gets hotter near the smell of a Harley. Too bad she's a former hooker/assassin with a classified file at Army intelligence. Before he uncovers her deadly past, he'll undergo a major ATTITUDE adjustment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qyHSiOok20vCNpaqVQ8Hdj1wsYV.jpg", "actors": ["Leon (Eddie Johnson)", "Gina Lim (Mai Lei)", "Nathaniel DeVeaux (Zeke)", "Susan Finque (Mendez)", "Nancy Griffiths (Panama)", "Demene E.
