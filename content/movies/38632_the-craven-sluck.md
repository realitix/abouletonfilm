Adele (Floraine Connors) loathes her husband and fantasizes about starring in a movie called \"The Craven Sluck.\" Bumping into a dashing suitor while out walking her dog, Adele thinks she may have finally found a way out. After all, Morton (George Kuchar) himself is stuck in a bum marriage with the irritating Florence (Bob Cowan). As it turns out, though, it's a flying saucer rather than a new boyfriend that will provide Adele with her escape route.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bDCVJeYlcQ3PYvdjOkAMChE1s3x.jpg", "actors": ["Floraine Connors (Adele)", "George Kuchar (Morton)", "Bob Cowan (Florence)", "Donna Kerness (Marilyn Marmoset)", "Bocko (Adele's Dog)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
