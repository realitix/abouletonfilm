Our narrative follows Peter \u2014 an average guy struggling with his weight \u2014 over the course of 24 hours, offering a realistic insight into a strangely unrepresented story: that of a man fighting to hide his unhealthy relationship with his body. From home, to work, to simply walking down the street, we watch as Peter battles an all-consuming illness, one bent on isolating him from every part of his waking life.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
