Mere Hote! relies on the age-old tricks that made masala films so popular with viewers in 1970s and 1980s. The movie throws logic out of the window [the obsessed girl is blessed with super-natural powers], unwanted songs keep popping up every 10 minutes [at times, every 5 minutes], there's a comedy track running parallel, with no connection whatsoever with the main plot.  Simply put, Kaash... Mere Hote! is archaic, outdated!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kU8YY9rOa7v3C1wtvBFI9ubQ3CS.jpg", "actors": ["Kumar Saahil (Krish)", "Sneha Ullal (Radhika)", "Sana Khaan (Piya)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
