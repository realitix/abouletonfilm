Lamour stars as Ann Castle, a former burlesque queen who heads westward to claim her father's silver mine. Powell plays mining engineer Steve Baird, who like Ann has a vested interest in the worked-out mine. With the help of genial counterfeiter Mortimer J. Slocum (Victor Moore), Steve and Ann are able to peddle mining stock, thus saving her from bankruptcy. The stockholders are in a lynching mood when it appears that they've been flim-flammed, but a last minute \"miracle\" saves the day. Featured in the cast are Paramount stalwarts Cass Daley and Gil Lamb, the former doing her quasi-Martha Raye act and the latter swallowing his harmonica for the millionth time. Production values are excellent and the songs are exuberantly performed; it's only in its hackneyed plot that Riding High slows to a clip-clop.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sXySLUMMdmu77fb0yNxvnyOlOdz.jpg", "actors": ["Dorothy Lamour (Ann Castle)", "Dick Powell (Steve Baird)", "Victor Moore (Mortimer J.
