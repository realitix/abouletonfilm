It is characterized by its rich orchestral sounds, beautifully punctuated with lyrical passages and choral interludes. Robert Calsen's staging sublimes that work with a post-modern production, both theatrically stunning and profundly decadent.  The performance has been unanimously acclaimed in San Francisco and Paris, and Samuel Ramey, the title role, has won both critical and popular approval.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vt8FvokK7OogMNY3zaXKTajX89d.jpg", "actors": ["Samuel Ramey ()", "Gabriela Benackova ()", "Dennis O'Neill ()", "Judith Christin ()", "Emily Manhart ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
