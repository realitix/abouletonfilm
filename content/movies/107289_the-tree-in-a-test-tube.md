Stan and Ollie then begin to open their pockets and briefcase, pulling out a variety of things that derive from the tree. The narrator talks all the way through this short film (about 7 minutes long). The idea is that scientists can put everything that comes from the tree into one test tube.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gRe6Ojsdit9jbeWK3gil6W1LQrP.jpg", "actors": ["Stan Laurel (Stan)", "Oliver Hardy (Oliver)", "Lee Vickers (Narrator (voice))", "Pete Smith (as Interlocutor (voice))"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "talisencrw", "content": "Interesting aside, an educational short guest-starring Laurel and Hardy and narrated by fellow comedian Pete Smith. Decent but not essential.
