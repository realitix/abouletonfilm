He expresses his wish at the family gathering, after his Roma coeval Xeni shows at the door, with his stray dog friend Aaj. This brings up a fired up discussion among the grown ups. After a quick disapproval, discussion changes its path into a clash of generations, conflict between traditional beliefs and new contemporary way of life. Ignored by grownups and despite his mother's disapproval, Genti joins Xeni and Aja on the street, continuing to find his new puppy-friend.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dwaXD8YBZdK665N8hx246osFcWP.jpg", "actors": ["Arti Lokaj (Genti)", "Ilire Vinca Celaj (Elmaze)", "Rozafa Celaj (Rozi)", "Timur Urcan (Xeni)", "Adriana Matoshi (Lirija)", "Alketa Sylay (Laura)", "Arta Selimi (Dija)", "Xhejlane Godanci (Fata)", "Edita Dula (Hatixha)", "Kumrije Hoxha (Sebi)", "Melihate Qena (Grandmother)", "Nina (Aya)", "Norik Xhemajli (Baby)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
