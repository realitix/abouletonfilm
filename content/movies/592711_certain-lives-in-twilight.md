He is accompanied by his former student and biographer in this journey, with whom he shares a complex relationship. As the disease continues to corrode his body and mind, the professor has to grapple with a memory that eludes him, regrets that haunt him and questions that he is yet to find answers to. Much like the veil of mist shrouding the valley, a great existential crisis envelops him. With the ghosts of his past resurfacing and the present turning into a nightmare, is it too late for him to seek redemption?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xTRTCS8lOrKZSJ17aaehFdxvD3J.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "itx9Lnyiy-U"}
