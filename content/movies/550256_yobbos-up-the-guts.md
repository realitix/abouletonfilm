YOBBOS! UP THE GUTS  A YOBBOMENTARY  Billy T (Bill Hunter), a stand-up promoter assembles a roughshod gang of Yobbos for one last comedy tour 'Up The Guts'. A 'Yobbomentary' crew accompany the tour to film an outback roadtrip, shot over a week with no script, no props, and no rest-stops. Russian Director Krem Noscj abandons the project mid-shoot after a punch up with Slapper (Warwick Capper) in Woomera, leaving Billy T and Wacko (Mark 'Jacko' Jackson) to pick up the pieces and finish the film. Tempers run high as the crew endure a forced-march under tough circumstances. Will they survive through to the last show in Darwin?  This film is a quirky no-budget / no-frills portrayal of fair-dinkum Aussies having a go against the odds.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Warwick Capper (Slapper)", "Bill Hunter (Billy T)", "Mark \"Jacko\" Jackson (Wacko)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "lNbHSFVAov0"}
