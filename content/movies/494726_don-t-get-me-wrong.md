Woods and Reginald Purdell and starring Max Miller and George E. Stone. It was made at Teddington Studios with sets designed by Peter Proud.  Unlike several of Miller's Teddington films which are now lost, this still survives.  Miller plays a fairground performer who meets a professor who claims to have invented a cheap substitute for petrol. They team up and persuade a millionaire to finance them to develop and market the product, while unsavoury elements are keen to steal the formula and try all means to get their hands on it, involving slapstick chases and double-crosses. It then turns out that the miracle fluid is diluted coconut oil, and the genius professor is an escaped lunatic. The millionaire finds himself taking the brunt of the disappointment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n53Av72oXmL042wD6oR27SxdfZQ.jpg", "actors": ["Max Miller (Wellington Lincoln)", "George E.
