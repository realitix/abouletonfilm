The film is divided in two parts, with the protagonist, a young woman \u2013 Jagoda \u2013 connecting them as a ghostly presence, bringing hope and reconciliation within the two narratives. She is a student visiting family in the summer, living in the declining villages of former Yugoslavia, overlooking the Adriatic coast. In the first story she bonds with a cousin in his mid-thirties, who is building a house in the village, but has no one to marry and live with him. In the second, she helps a teenage cousin understand that his nation is no better than others, and that they all have to learn to live together on the recently established borders.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cIXgtQHdSWkz07LaHZt4Tkchkrv.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Budak ()", "Dubravka Draki\u0107 ()", "\u017deljko Milo\u0161evi\u0107 ()", "Marta Pi\u0107uri\u0107 ()", "Momo Pi\u0107uri\u0107 ()", "Vahidin Preli\u0107 ()", "Kristina Stevovi\u0107 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
