However, he accidentally chops down the wrong tree, felling the tree that sustains life itself. When the latter tree falls, all life disappears. The nomad then finds himself in the middle of a desert that he does not recognize, and he tries to work his way out of it. During this particular quest, he comes across a small tree that is in the process of dying and opts instead to save this one.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oH6FfPM7Tl1Qs5LEow02ykz9RaX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
