Americans consume nearly twenty billion new items of clothing each year, and at least one billion of them are made in China. Cotton Road uncovers the transnational movement of cotton and tells the stories of workers lives in a conventional cotton supply chain. From rural farms in South Carolina to factory cities in China, we span the globe to encounter the industrial processes behind our rapacious consumption of cheap clothing and textile products. Are we connected to one another through the things we consume? Cotton Road explores a contemporary landscape of globalized labor through human stories and provides an opportunity to reflect on the ways our consumption impacts others and drives a global economy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/anawMQcLJG99o7WT33py27rNM7c.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
