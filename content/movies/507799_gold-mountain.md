Jorge, a poor Mexican peasant, and his son Fernando believe they have struck it rich when they find an enormous gold rock. Upon entering the nearest town to cash in, they quickly become entangled with a dangerous outlaw who has eyes on their fortune. After the rock and child go missing, Jorge teams up with a conniving Chinese immigrant to find his son and get back what is his, but not before running into a surplus of outrageous characters including an unsavory hunting party...or killing each other first in this wacky adventure!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h7hTwozRuZMwHD3bNviLp8QYccY.jpg", "actors": ["Michael Nos\u00e9 (Chan)", "Michael A.
