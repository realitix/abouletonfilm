In turn, the IRA has sent two members after Riley because he shot an IRA soldier and must pay the consequences. The two IRA operatives looking for Riley come across a really nasty biker who wants vengeance on Eve for setting his car on fire -- and the three men finally track her and Chrissie to the wine-growing country of Barossa Valley. The final denouement is about to explode, as Riley also arrives on the scene. With under-par acting and a patchy plot, this film was never released theatrically.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wmUzpgwbNwPg5VXdFAHEfhGh4Pj.jpg", "actors": ["Carmen Duncan (Eve)", "Michael Aitkens (Riley)", "Shane Briant (Terrier)", "Red Symons (Pitt (as Redmond Symons))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "O4G8QlVNXsU"}
