They could have been some of Jack Kerouac\u2019s Dharma bums or Ken Kesey's freaks or militants like Jerry Rubin. They probably have been all these things. Like so many others from their generation, they wanted and tried to change the world. The world, though, went the other way. So, Kate and Kemp chose to live their lives in a way that was consistent with their vision and ideas. Retreating in a place that was once a mercury mine, they go on their daily routines in what seems to be a celebration of Gary Snider\u2019s values. Still fervent radicals, they follow with growing concern and anxiety the Trump campaign, not believing their eyes and fearing the worst.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b6XYcUF9GvWcO2EI3GERazn9Ify.jpg", "actors": ["Kate Woods (herself)", "Kemp Woods (himself)", "Tom Chargin (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "uyBbB_m-DnE"}
