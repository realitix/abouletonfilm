In the 2010 revival, he made history by taking on the baritone title role, one of Verdi\u2019s most fascinating characters, and thrilling audiences with his multifaceted and gripping portrayal. Boccanegra is beset on all sides, juggling political adversaries bent on murder with his love for his long-lost daughter Amelia (Adrianne Pieczonka). James Levine\u2019s conducting brings out all the color and surging emotion of Verdi\u2019s magnificent score.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rRaUMD1bvhbBUiFlmUGZDJXV2nC.jpg", "actors": ["Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (Simon Boccanegra)", "James Morris (Jacopo Fiesco)", "Adrianne Pieczonka (Amelia)", "Marcello Giordani (Gabriele Adorno)", "Stephen Gaertner (Paolo Albini)", "James Levine (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "SEWsrUIc6kI"}
