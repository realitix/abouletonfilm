It deals with the reactions of an older man and a young woman to the news stories that occur in 1968: the May student protests, Vietnam, Biafra. It is scattered, apparently disconnected. The characters find themselves in illogical situations: in a train cemetery, in a ruined house where some young people edit a journal. There is no sound of steps, and doors, when opened or closed, make no sound.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A7ZHqjhH26FG0fwuJnxEg5PN2sP.jpg", "actors": ["Antonio Betancourt ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
