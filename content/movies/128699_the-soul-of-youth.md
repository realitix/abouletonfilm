His character, known merely as \"the boy,\" has been raised in an orphanage where he has caused as much trouble as possible. He finally can't stand living there anymore and runs away. On the streets he finds a friend in Mike (Ernest Butterworth), a newsboy. Mike teaches him how to survive but inevitably the boy gets hauled into court. However, the judge sees potential in him and hands him over to be adopted by a young politician. The judge, incidentally, is played by Judge Ben Lindsey, who was famous in his day for his efforts to give delinquent boys a decent chance in life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/spEP93lxqz45KCfOHARQjWzLGyX.jpg", "actors": ["Lewis Sargent (Ed Simpson)", "Lila Lee (Vera Hamilton)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
