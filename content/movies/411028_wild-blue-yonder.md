Weiner recontextualizes the everyday, leveling gestures, conversations, actions and interactions into a system of codes that blur the boundaries between what is choreographed and what is improvised. Weiner's visual grammar (arrows, horizons, frames) suggests motion and borders; the relationships of the animations, aphoristic text, and conversations activate questions of intimacy within the conventions of physical and personal space.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lrbFaor76S6rUjhEG0LqHcUvfsu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
