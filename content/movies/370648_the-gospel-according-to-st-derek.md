The Gospel\u2026 also promotes Derek Jarman\u2019s importance as one of Britain's finest film-makers and acts, therefore, as a rally call to all would-be independent film-makers. This is the \u201910 commandments of St. Derek \u2018(who was indeed canonised by the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence) on low-budget film-making.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "bFIfpSyTttE"}
