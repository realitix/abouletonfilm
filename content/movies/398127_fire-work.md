The room is inhabited by an unreliable narrator, who explores facts, fiction and his personal memories whilst telling the story. The connections made are sometimes obvious, sometimes obscure, all of them originating from the psychogeographical surroundings of the main protagonist.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/idyqhgEim55DdQcvME9t2bnoovC.jpg", "actors": ["Sam Samuel ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
