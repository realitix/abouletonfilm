This is a favorite work, where everything is arranged for life. Book racks, a selection of music gourmet discs: Tom Waits, The Rolling Stones, etc. On the walls of the picture are oil paintings with views of the morgue. No cynicism - professionalism, humor and the realized dream of a man who, since childhood, dreams of understanding why a person actually dies.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
