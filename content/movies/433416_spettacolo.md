Every summer, their piazza became their stage and residents of all ages played a part \u2013 the role of themselves. Monticchiello\u2019s annual tradition has attracted worldwide attention and kept the town together for 50 years, but with an aging population and a future generation more interested in Facebook than farming, the town\u2019s 50th\u2013anniversary performance just might be its last. SPETTACOLO tells the story of Teatro Povero di Monticchiello, interweaving episodes from its past with its modern-day process as the villagers turn a series of devastating blows into a new play about the end of their world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cOjgsL6AiQhPhzCXvQag9OcHIhp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
