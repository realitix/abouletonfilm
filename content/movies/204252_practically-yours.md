Instead of his dog Piggy he is thought to be in love with Peggy, a girl he worked with. The usual farce ensues after he returns home alive and tries to play along with the mistake to save embarrassment for all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7VVI0gLwa14UaKB9nkX9QzDZn0z.jpg", "actors": ["Fred MacMurray (Daniel Bellamy)", "Claudette Colbert (Peggy Martin)", "Gil Lamb (Albert W.
