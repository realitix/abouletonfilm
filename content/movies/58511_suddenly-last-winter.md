Nothing to get worked up about in a western European country, you would think \u2013 and you\u2019d be wrong. Even in Euroland there are places where the acknowledgment of the basic civil rights of same-sex couples is a hot issue. Suddenly, Gustav\u2019s and Luca\u2019s quiet private life has been turned upside down.

In a matter of days it turns into the hottest political and cultural issue on the national agenda while intolerant homophobic attacks increase dramatically.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3gioURQJdtZxPqhAlbMblvvA54r.jpg", "actors": ["Gustav Hofer ()", "Luca Ragazzi ()", "Veronica Pivetti (Voce narrante)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
