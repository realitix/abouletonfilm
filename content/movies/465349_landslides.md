It is about 'the body' in all of the senses of that word - the body of woman, of man, a body of past work, the body of earth, celestial bodies. It reveals and questions the assumed dichotomies of mind and body, body and soul, past and future, inside and outside, life and death, earth and space.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
