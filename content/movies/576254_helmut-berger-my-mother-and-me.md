She is shocked: only an addicted shadow of the former icon seems to be left. She decides to halt the obvious catastrophic decline of the once \u201cmost handsome man in the world\u201d. As a consequence, this one-time god of the screen is suddenly sitting on my mother\u2019s sofa in Nordsehl in Lower Saxony. And he stays put - for several months. While he trustingly rolls out his whole life before us, the dividing lines between film team, world star and family intermingle. This is a film about ageing, rising and falling - and about the fact that it is sometimes possible to regain an element of dignity in life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u958XyXoElNzOYogmWFLLaJop1f.jpg", "actors": ["Helmut Berger (Himself)", "Bettina Vorndamme ()", "Karla Vorndamme ()", "Ophelia Gassmann ()", "Samia Tahanouti ()", "Dr. Dietmar Peikert ()", "Richard Maschke ()", "Birgit Insinger ()", "Ernst Stahlhut ()", "Matthias Harder ()", "Ren\u00e9 Fietzek ()", "Christophe Monten\u00e9z ()", "Albert Serra ()", "Doris Kohn ()", "Christin Bahro ()", "Valesca Peters (Voiceover)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
