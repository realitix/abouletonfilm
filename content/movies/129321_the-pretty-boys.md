Writer-director Everett Lewis' 1973-set period piece concerns Pagan, a shirtless, pansexual, drug-addled singer-songwriter. He's smitten with hunky Donovan, probed by an ambitious journalist and drugged by an evil groupie. Unfolding as a double LP, Pretty Boys meanders from seductive and weird to wild and tender. -Gary Kramer, Instinct Magazine", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2PWR12ZRvyXnCwggV4nZlJVmZky.jpg", "actors": ["Josh Beren ()", "Dale Dymkoski (Pagan)", "Erin Muir (Vangela)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
