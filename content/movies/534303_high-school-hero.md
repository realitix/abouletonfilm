But with the class roster on this Monogram campus made up of Freddie Stewart, June Preisser, Anne Rooney et al, it's only a matter of about 45 more minutes before the team wins, the paper gets a large circulation boost and all hands are on stage performing with the Freddie Slack and Jan Savitt orchestras.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/w83uO7ZkASOcOar5LZxLlFErYaI.jpg", "actors": ["Freddie Stewart (Frederick \"Freddie\" Trimball)", "June Preisser (Dodie Rogers)", "Anne Rooney (Addie Rogers)", "Noel Neill (Betty Rogers)", "Warren Mills (Lee Watson)", "Jackie Moran (Jimmy Forrest)", "Frankie Darro (Roy Donne)", "Milton Kibbee (Principal Owen Townley)", "Belle Mitchell (Miss Hinklefink)", "Lita Baron (Chi-Chi)", "Douglas Fowley (Coach Carter)", "Edythe Elliott (Mrs. Rogers)", "Leonard Penn (Prof. Farrell)", "Pierre Watkin (Gov.
