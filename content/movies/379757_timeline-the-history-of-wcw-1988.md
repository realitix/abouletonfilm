The time the year is 1988 in WCW and Ted Turner is about to step in and buy the company from the Crockett family. They're beginning to feel the battle wounds as WWE and WCW begin running big events against each other. The war is in high gear.  J.J. Dillon takes us inside the company and also inside the office, as he was working for the Crocketts there as well.

But did he ever really 'have it?'", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jWOpiLRf4qTrTxHUo8Rvp7Ng1cF.jpg", "actors": ["J.J.
