Genevieve, MO and its descendants of German immigrants from the Black Forest who founded three little villages called Zell, Weingarten and New Offenburg. This is the last generation of people who grew up as foreigners in the US, learning the Badisch dialect as a first language. Now they are Americans, but still keep their second identity, hidden and unknown even for their own children and grandchildren and the generations to come.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9uKOsoE9hrqnNvbffC49PSsXohp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "HTnPiIf5iD4"}
