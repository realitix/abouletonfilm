Their names: MONSTERS OF DEATH. Their character: vicious. MONSTERS OF DEATH doesn't waste your time with lullabies, instead it\u2019s packed with the most deadly metal stuff conceivable: 55 video clips, cautiously compiled by Skandinavian-European and American style Death Metal, plus six live recordings and an ample audio section with new and unreleased stuff.
