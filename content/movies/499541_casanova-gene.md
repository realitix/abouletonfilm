In a dressing room, John Malkovich sheds the costume of Casanova. A young woman's skirt is just as orange as the beak of a zebra finch singing in a cage. White lilies stand at the foot of a statue of the Virgin Mary, red roses in front of the window of an SM studio. There the quiet game of submission in exchange for money, in a museum an embrace, a poem whispered in the ear. Children playing in a forest in autumn. A forest in summer, framed by light. An orgasm and a dance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gSqiMnMUNhi9z9AzrenehzdTQCN.jpg", "actors": ["Wolfgang Forstmeier ()", "John Malkovich ()", "Elija Pott ()", "Undine de Rivi\u00e8re ()", "Lumi Lausas ()", "Luise Donschen ()", "Zacharias Zitouni ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
