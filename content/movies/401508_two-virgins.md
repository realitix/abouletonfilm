I haven't played my copy in a few years, so I can't tell you which side it is. For the first ten minutes or so, we see Lennon's and Ono's faces superimposed upon each other's (much like the record label on SOMETIME IN NEW YORK CITY a few years later). Then we see John and Yoko touching each other, hugging, and kissing for about ten minutes. They are clothed, unlike on the TWO VIRGINS album cover. The film is in color and seems to be have been shot in a lovely outdoor area in the midst of woods and gardens, with a lovely blue sky. Like the album the music came from , this probably meant more to the people involved in making it than it will to anyone watching it. Lennon does smile a lot, and I'm glad he was happy. Collectors will want to see this, but you might want to see it and then pass it along to another fan as it isn't the sort of thing you'll watch very often.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bEJfJx2Z6a4IO2BUlJ3dvVsgLXD.jpg", "actors": ["John Lennon ()", "Yoko Ono ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
