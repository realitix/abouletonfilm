In Last Safari, Capstick tracks his own personal \"crown jewel\" -- the leopard. Could Capstick have met his match with this elusive, wary and deadly animal? Could it be a case of the hunter becoming the hunted? More pulse-pounding adventure from one of the world's most intrepid explorers.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
