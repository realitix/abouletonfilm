The movie, which runs for just more than an hour, includes music videos for each song on the album and is supposed to represent a visual interpretation of the record. Lead singer Tunde Adebimpe not only directed the Nine Types of Light film, but also storybooked it and helmed the video for \"Forgotten.\" Additionally, the rest of the band worked with friends and filmmakers to help conceptualize and direct the rest of the music videos.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iylWCkc1RSvquU9l2w5EN5UhNaz.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
