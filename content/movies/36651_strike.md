In oppression, she found courage. In solidarity, she found a reason to believe again. Acclaimed German actress Katharina Thalbach (THE TIN DRUM, SOPHIE\u0092S CHOICE) stars in this hard-hitting historical drama set during the rise of Poland\u0092s Solidarity movement. An illiterate single mother, Agnieszka Kowalska is a Socialist \"heroine of labor\" for working long hours as a shipyard welder\u0085 until her superiors deny compensation to the widows of 21 workers killed in an industrial disaster. Risking her job, her life, and the love of her son to defy the bureacracy, Agnieszka inspires the largest labor strike in world history\u0085 and becomes a national hero. Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff adapted this \"ballad based on historical events\" from the biography of Anna Walentynowicz, the free trade activist who mobilized a million Poles for Solidarity and helped hasten the fall of Communism.  Filmed entirely on location at Poland\u0092s Lenin Shipyard, where history was made.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/Ak5f6CRf29skgL5uZ2Zg8gCVLNF.jpg", "actors": ["Katharina Thalbach (Agnieszka Kowalska)", "Andrzej Chyra (Lech Walesa)", "Dominique Horwitz (Kazimierz)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
