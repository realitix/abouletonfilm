Her deliberate rhyming of color and light contrasts wondrously with the incidental nature of the scenes depicted. Rockets are fired off in the backyard, mussels collected on a rocky shore and plates passed down a long picnic table. Keller\u2019s montage grazes the sublime mystery of feeling at home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3z7EMqINmgjRcqZDa6j41Dk0MQS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
