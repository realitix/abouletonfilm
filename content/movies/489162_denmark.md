He\u2019s lost his welfare, can\u2019t hold a job, can\u2019t talk to his son, has a neighbour who won\u2019t shut up and a diet that consists mainly of cheap beer and mushy peas. It\u2019s no way to live and he knows it.\r Then he learns from a TV news report that Danish prisoners have it way better than he does: a job, accessible healthcare, the quiet of the countryside, even an HDTV. They\u2019re practically living in hotels.\r He says goodbye (and good riddance) to his dingy flat and smuggles himself to Denmark aboard a cargo ship, landing in a quaint town with everything he needs -- including a bank to rob. But when he meets a friendly local barmaid and a lovable stray dog that won\u2019t leave his side, he begins to wonder if prison really is his only chance of a fulfilling life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lQEqqzqFcfOS7NZtbIXvnGfteGN.jpg", "actors": ["Rafe Spall (Herb)", "Steve Speirs (Harry the Horse)", "Martin Frislev Ammitsb\u00f8l (Bossman)", "Thomas W.
