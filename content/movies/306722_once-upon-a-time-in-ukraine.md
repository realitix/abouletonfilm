She was raped by a corrupt policeman, her friend was killed, and now she seeks refuge with the protesters on Maidan Square. Revolutionary chaos prevails, and it\u2018s not at all clear who remains loyal to whom and which means can be regarded as legitimate in the struggle for freedom. Ultimately Nina and her tormentors come face to face again and the spiral of violence is stepped up a further notch. The film was shot to a genuine backdrop, the result of which is a multifaceted allegory on the tragedy currently playing out in the Ukraine.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uuB8wmciMIj66NUmhk0Gihd5xoR.jpg", "actors": ["Ellen Sliusarchi ()", "Igor Parfenov ()", "Alexsandr Yachno ()", "Alexsandr Zygulya ()", "Artem Ragra ()", "Roman Zhirov ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
