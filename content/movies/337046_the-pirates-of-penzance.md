Sullivan regarded this operetta - a hit ever since its first production in New York in 1879 - as the best comedy he composed. He even said of his collaborator, \"The libretto is ingenious, clever, wonderfully fun in parts and sometimes brilliant in dialogue - beautifully written for music, as is all Gilbert does.\" Indeed, audiences will find the music every bit a match for the lyrics, with the genius of the score lying in its parody of grand opera. Filmed in 1985 at the world-famous Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hnrgniWe3KT40QlLvTxwqWmO6vK.jpg", "actors": ["Jeff Hyslop (Frederic)", "Brent Carver (The Pirate King)", "Caralyn Tomlin (Mabel)", "Douglas Chamberlain (Maj.
