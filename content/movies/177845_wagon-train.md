A certain Matt Gardner (Cliff Clark) wants to corner the freight business to Pecos and persuades young Zack Sibley's wagon master (Wade Crosby) to switch sides. Zack also earns the enmity of Gardner's son Coe (Malcolm McTaggart), who takes umbrage to the youngster's flirtation with pretty Helen Lee (Martha O'Driscoll). It all comes to a head during a food shortage in Pecos, a near-disaster that persuades the wagon master to switch sides once again. When the dust settles, Zack learns that old man Gardner is actually Carl Anderson, the man who murdered his father.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tDyQtQvXwBrwcXFhDjKYPbs4iA0.jpg", "actors": ["Tim Holt (Zack Sibley)", "Martha O'Driscoll (Helen Lee)", "Ray Whitley (Ned)", "Emmett Lynn (Whopper)", "Glenn Strange (Stagecoach driver)", "Malcolm 'Bud' McTaggart (Coe Gardner)", "Cliff Clark (Matt Gardner)", "Ellen Lowe (Amanthy)", "Wade Crosby (O'Follard)", "Ethan Laidlaw (Henchman Pat Hays)", "Monte Montague (Henchman Kurt)", "Carl Stockdale (Luke Wilkes)", "Bruce Dane (McKenzie)", "Chuck Baldra (Wagon Train Cook and Musician)", "Ed Brady (Sam - Storekeeper)", "Eddie Dew (Peter O'Conner)", "Duke (Zack's Horse)", "Mart\u00edn Garralaga (Buyer of Beans)", "Harry Harvey (Stage Passenger)", "Lloyd Ingraham (Mayor of Pecos)", "Tom London (Henchman Charlie)", "Cactus Mack (Freighter)", "Robert McKenzie (Howard - Horse Trader)", "Bud Osborne (Henchman)", "Julian Rivero (Vaquero)", "Jim Toney (Pipestem Station Agent)", "Bess Wade (Bacon Buyer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
