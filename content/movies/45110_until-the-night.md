Robert (Norman Reedus) is a writer who hasn't done much writing lately; instead, he's busy pushing the envelope with his toxic mix of boredom, drugs and a dalliance with a married woman, Elizabeth (Kathleen Robertson). In spite of Elizabeth's marital status, Robert falls for her completely -- a commitment that just may blow up in his face, along with the rest of his life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9BgS6lBfwahNKiHM4K4J5stLkD.jpg", "actors": ["Norman Reedus (Robert)", "Michael T.
