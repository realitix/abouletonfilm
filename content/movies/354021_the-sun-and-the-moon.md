All are caught in their own isolation and are fearful of the menace that has to be met. The film, as a personal interpretation of Beauty and the Beast, enciphers concerns, beliefs and desires in seductive images that are themselves a form of camouflage, making it possible to utter harsh truths.'", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A6saSL3k8z65eDoTKOiSyQTGfbM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
