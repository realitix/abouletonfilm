It was basically made for me and even I'm pretty mixed on it. But what I don't get is the number of people throwing out half star reviews. That's literally the lowest possible rating, I just don't see how _Terminal_ is a tie for world's worst movie. My expectations were pretty middling, and they were just more or less reached.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"}], "recommandations_id": [396806, 340022, 459258, 438689], "youtube_key": "0le19v80S80"}
