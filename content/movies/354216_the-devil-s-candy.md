Here the devil makes one character kill and another paint dark disturbing pictures of which they have no memory of painting. But rather than clich\u00e9 us or bore us with the same old \"call a priest\" which we have seen a million times, the story plays out as a very human drama of one man dealing with what doctors would call a mental illness, and another dealing with an obsession that is costing him his family.\r\n\r\nYet do not think the film is without chills. Indeed it has some extremely disturbing and violent scenes! However these are done with a modicum of gore and blood so they are not gross out horrors; rather than true horrors as they let you in on what is happening just enough to worry your mind.\r\n\r\nThe film also makes a subtle statement about how we as a society fail to treat mental patients with violent pasts.\r\n\r\nActing all around is top notch. Ethan Embry, Shiri Appleby (nice to see after not having seen her in a while), Kiara Glasco, and Pruitt Taylor Vince never once drop the ball; bringing us fully into their worlds."}, {"pseudo": "Gimly", "content": "Goes largely unresolved, but still has a good grasp of the technical aspects and some small amount of originality.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I personally recommend you give it a go._"}], "recommandations_id": [378018, 409297, 397981, 291272]}
