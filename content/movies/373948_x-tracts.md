For the image we created a gridded score of movements, both within the frame ('subject moves right to left') and between the camera and the subject (zooms, pans, tilts...,) using this as a shooting script. The sound was derived from an old journal, read out loud and then cut-up into the same units of time as the image, ranging from 3 seconds to 1/4 second. Assembling the material was largely mechanical, following the predetermined score. That a tonal portrait of a person emerges was an after effect; we thought of the film as a structural or indexical system of sound/image relations, and viewed the soundtrack as a linguistic experiment, working with the building blocks of speech. - LT", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dwsJn4j6djmQI4Trt7dpVEfYWJk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
