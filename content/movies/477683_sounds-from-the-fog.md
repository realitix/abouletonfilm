Director Klaus Stanjek's cheerful Uncle Willi lived with his family, except when he was touring as a musician across Germany. Only when Willi turned 90 did his nephew Klaus Stanjek detect what his whole family had hidden: that Uncle Willi has spent eight years in Nazi camps and that he was gay. In a radical personal approach, veteran filmmaker Stanjek follows the complex turns that his family takes when they confront his Uncle Willi's secret. The result is a personal and political portrait of his beloved uncle, a talented singer and accordion player, that is one part historical inquiry and one part fascinating detective story.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/HCwh6UBO9HDpoAeKQdBaZqCXh2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
