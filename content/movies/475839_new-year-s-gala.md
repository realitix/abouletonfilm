So it\u2019s wise not to squander those affections. When everyone else just puckers up to the nearest set of lips, Robin has always kept her wits \u2014 and her mouth \u2014 to herself. An established photographer at a lifestyle website, she\u2019s assigned to work on a New Year\u2019s Eve story with a new hire, Todd. When she confides in Todd that she has never kissed anyone as the clock strikes midnight, he sets about to correct this, by finding someone for Robin to kiss at the magic hour. His theory is a kiss is just a kiss, and she should enjoy the moment. Ultimately, they are both right. Todd finds a man for her to smooch, and Robin does find the right man. And guess who fits the bill?", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
