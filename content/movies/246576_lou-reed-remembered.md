With contributions from Bob Ezrin, Mick Rock, Lenny Kaye, Paul Auster, Moe Tucker, Boy George, Thurston Moore, Andrew Wylie, Victor Bockris, Holly Woodlawn, Mary Woronov and Steve Hunter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6YrT5eCEkjsZAqz9Jmx7CJm1x55.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
