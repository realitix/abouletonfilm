A British diplomat had been kidnapped, a Qu\u00e9bec cabinet minister murdered. The troops were brought in as a safeguard. This film is a vigorous reflection of the discussions and analyses of the situation that went on wherever people gathered, voicing attitudes and fears, sympathies and concerns.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/94OVBkeE9N7U1XAzArnkDW0UYqG.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
