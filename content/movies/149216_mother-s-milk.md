{"tmdb_id": 149216, "title": "Mother's Milk", "original_title": "Mother's Milk", "slug_title": "mother-s-milk", "date": "", "genre": [""], "score": "7.0/10", "synopsis": "A coruscating drama, based on an award winning novel, which explores the troubled relationships between the various members of an English family over a long summer when Eleanor, the stroke-afflicted old mother decides to give away her beautiful house in Provence to a New Age Foundation run by an Irish charlatan rather than to her own son and his young family. The story is told from the point-of-view firstly of Robert, an eight year old boy, then his increasingly drunken father, Patrick and also finally Mary, his long-suffering mother as they all struggle to come to terms with the loss of something they love desperately but increasingly realize will soon be gone forever. It is both a funny and moving tale of family discord.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
