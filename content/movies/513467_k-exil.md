{"tmdb_id": 513467, "title": "K Exil", "original_title": "K Exil", "slug_title": "k-exil", "date": "2008-01-01", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "Two-thirds of K (Exil) consists of images of the women and children who remain at home, alone, while the men leave for a life of exile. These images, always fragmentary (either cut-up or inserted piece by piece within the image as a whole), alternating between negative and positive, complementing or contradicting each other - give an insight into the wrenching separation experienced by those members of the population who remain at home, left to their fate in an inhospitable landscape.  Over what we call the 'joints', we will engrave words in French or Kabyle (Berber), echoing the masculine voices of Rachid Adel and Michel Amarger. An original composition by Mr. Djamel Tareb will form the musical sound-track for the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2oE3ozF2lMDaI2l4XyOPVa79kmF.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
