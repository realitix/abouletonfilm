Recorded in 2009 (Baltimore, MD) and 2010 (Cleveland, OH), two almost completely different set lists combine for some heavy duty rock and roll, no doubt. The perfect mix of Black Flag and Black Sabbath in ragged, live glory. 25 plus years of blues based ugly rock boiled down into one DVD.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7OijKmiP809Br6EGf8SB9eQGjqr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "M95gssxvnyY"}
