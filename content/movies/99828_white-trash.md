In all senses of the word. The opening is a sure-fire nominee for Best Oral Scene of the year. In it, we are treated to the gloriously crotch-bulging sight of cousin Luther (Trent Cougar) bitch-slapping, spitting on and literally gagging his cockpig nephew Bret Wolfe. And then hocking a mouthful of beer on him. We ain't got no shame here: we've watched it twice already. Rod Barry is a hoot as a \"fuckin' cousin,\" and Sharon Kane's cameo as a trashy neighbor is a scream. Break out the mac-n-cheese: Tony Alizzi's in the house!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mLhBKUARaLodcd8PXwB4gxeY1f4.jpg", "actors": ["Rod Barry (Cousin Amos)", "Jake Christian (Cousin Jeremiah)", "Trent Cougar (Uncle Luther)", "Clay Maverick ()", "Chad Johnson ()", "Anthony Shaw ()", "Luke Pearson ()", "Rowdy Carson ()", "Frieda Lay Brown ()", "Sharon Kane ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
