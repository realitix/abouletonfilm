Noise, located on the tape as a constituent part of the film, becomes the aim of Makino\u2019s quest \u2013 Noise-Image. This quest for a new film experience intensifies with additional effects \u2013 a smoke curtain reveals the fullness of the light beams\u2019 rainbow spectrum, while a neutral single-eye ND filter creates a three-dimensional illusion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5zFYSdn2JZ8GnGKUy4Kt4ZtAWkV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
