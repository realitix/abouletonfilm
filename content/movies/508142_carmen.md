The Australian director is one of the world\u2019s most sought-after opera directors, whose Royal Opera debut with Shostakovich\u2019s The Nose in 2016 was greeted with delight. For Carmen he has devised a far-from-traditional version, incorporating music written by Bizet for the score but not usually heard, and giving a new voice to the opera\u2019s endlessly fascinating central character.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nFxJGYcV2JKuWnylOBuRqzRRukD.jpg", "actors": ["Anna Goryachova (Carmen)", "Francesco Meli (Don Jos\u00e9)", "Kostas Smoriginas (Escamillo)", "Gyula Nagy (Moral\u00e8s)", "Kristina Mkhitaryan (Mica\u00ebla)", "David Soar (Zuniga)", "Jacquelyn Stucker (Frasquita)", "Aigul Akhmetshina (Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s)", "Pierre Doyen (Danca\u00efro)", "Jean-Paul Fouch\u00e9court (Remendado)", "Claude De Demo (Voice of Carmen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "JqJmpB0x0gI"}
