They manage to find themselves by chance in a State-level tournament, expected to be knocked out in the very first round. But the bunch of young men who share different thoughts and ideas, with the help of a professional kabbadi coach, emerge as winners. As they proceed, many difficulties are encountered such as Suri having a shoulder dislocation during a match. However, they win all their remaining games and progress to the final.
