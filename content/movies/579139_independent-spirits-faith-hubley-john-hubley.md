Coming from a background of traditional animation, artist and activist John was transformed as a filmmaker when he married sound and music editor Faith. Together they changed the face of animation, producing films that explored serious issues such as overpopulation and nuclear annihilation, always based on their personal beliefs, and winning many awards, including two Oscars. Since John\u00b9s death in 1977, Faith continued to make one film a year, cherishing, as she and John always did, independent thinking and filmmaking. Here is the story of two remarkable people, their lives together and alone, the great musicians with whom they worked, their children, whose voices are heard on many Hubley films, and clips from more than a dozen Hubley Studio titles.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
