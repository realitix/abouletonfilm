From the richness of the Cape of Good Hope to blizzards in the high Atlas Mountains, from the brooding jungles of the Congo to the steaming swamps and misty savannahs, Africa explores the whole continent. An astonishing array of previously unknown places are revealed along with bizarre new creatures and extraordinary behaviours.Using the latest in filming technology including remote HD cameras, BBC One takes an animal's eye view of the action. The journey begins in the Kalahari, Africa's ancient southwest corner, where two extraordinary deserts sit side by side and even the most familiar of its creatures have developed ingenious survival techniques.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rS1ugfrybAwUmixtaGOW0vmTmL7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
