He is suffering, he is apathetic and is mentioning suicide constantly, he simply doesn't want to accept that the relationship is over. He has self-pitying sessions with his friend Bane (Milos Samolov) everyday. Despite Bane's advice, Alek keeps calling Teodora who has fallen in love with Nemanja (Branislav Trifunovic) in the meantime. However decisive and tough Teodora is when she is with Alek, she is as indulgent and helpless when she is spending time with Nemanja. The problem is that Nemanja is not in love with her but with Marina (Vanja Ejdus), a girl by a few years younger. Unfortunately, Marina is not in love with him, she is very attracted to Alek's \"Slavic depression\". She doesn't know that reason for his \"charm of a desperate\" is his failure with Teodora, she thinks Alek was born like that.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eDmvpY7CTCjn9HxfbLGe3uyW5Ms.jpg", "actors": ["Milo\u0161 Samolov (Bane)", "Mirjana Karanovi\u0107 (Andja)", "Gordan Ki\u010di\u0107 (Alek)", "Milica Mihajlovi\u0107 (Teodora)", "Branislav Trifunovi\u0107 (Nemanja)", "Predrag Ejdus (Marina)", "Petar Bo\u017eovi\u0107 (Milenko)", "Jelena \u0110oki\u0107 (Dejana)", "Danica Maksimovi\u0107 ()", "Ljubomir Bandovi\u0107 ()", "Tanja Pjevac ()", "Vanja Ejdus (Marina)", "Danica Maksimovi\u0107 (Razredna)", "Tanja Pjevac (Slavica)", "Josif Tati\u0107 (Govornik na sahrani)", "Radoslav Milenkovi\u0107 (Konobar)", "Neboj\u0161a Radosavljevi\u0107 (Svestenik)", "Ana Saki\u0107 (Maturantkinja 1)", "Radoslav Petrovic (Crkvenjak)", "Branislav Kicic (Filmski radnik)", "Miro Barnjak (Kondukter)", "Maja Gardinovacki (Zena u crnini)", "Marija Stojanovic (Prodavacica karata)", "Dubravka Kovjani\u0107 (Maturantkinja 2)", "Branislav Toma\u0161evi\u0107 (Maturant)", "Sergej Trifunovi\u0107 (Profesor fizickog)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [49602], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
