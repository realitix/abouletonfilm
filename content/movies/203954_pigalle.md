The seediest side of urban life is examined in this tragedy. The film follows the complex, interwoven lives of four characters as they live their harsh and gritty nocturnal lives on the city streets. The main characters are Fifi a pickpocket who is simultaneously involved with Divine, a transvestite hooker and Vera a peep show dancer who refuses to be a hooker. Vera lives with her would-be pimp Jesus le Gitan, a small-scale drug dealer. When the area riff-raff become embroiled in hostilities, two of main characters are slowly killed in horrible ways. Fifi is then left to avenge their deaths.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/t7cCIJ4l7juOlm3wI3i3etnI3jd.jpg", "actors": ["V\u00e9ra Briole (V\u00e9ra)", "Francis Renaud (Fifi)", "Raymond Gil (Fernande)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
