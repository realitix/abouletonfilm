During the making of this film, filmmakers uncovered new evidence of White's innocence and brought the case back to Federal Court. Holy Man offers a rare glimpse into the mysterious world of Lakota religion, their intimate connection to the land, and a provocative expose of the systemic injustice that Native Americans face in the criminal justice system.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8wlbAS2HkVVtAIhZL2XaneplLKc.jpg", "actors": ["Martin Sheen (Narrator)", "Russell Means ()", "Floyd Red Crow Westerman ()", "Fred Alan Wolf ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
