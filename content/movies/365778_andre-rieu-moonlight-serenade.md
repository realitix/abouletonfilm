You\u2019ve seen him on Dancing On Ice, you\u2019ve heard him on Forever Vienna but you\u2019ve never known Andr\u00e9 like this before. Be swept away by \"Emperor\u2019s Waltz\", romanced by the Theme from Romeo and Juliet and let Andr\u00e9 serenade you from a Venetian gondola with Offenbach\u2019s \"Barcarolle\". This fantastic new album continues with a beautiful arrangement of \"O Mio Babbino Caro\", a delicious Mozart Medley with all of your favourites from \"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik\" to \"Elvira Madigan\", and even ends with \"Auld Lang Syne\" (bagpipes and all!).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/13YGEE8rNn3zUdBJByaiwXTz047.jpg", "actors": ["Andr\u00e9 Rieu ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
