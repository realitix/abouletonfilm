Their unlikely journey parallels the dramatic transformation of school lunch from a patchwork of local anti-hunger efforts to a robust national feeding program. The film tracks the behind-the-scenes details of school lunch and childhood hunger from key moments in the 1940s, 1960s, and 1980s to the present.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kusAQwrqjJPl6WqHB5qJ8AzWRyX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
