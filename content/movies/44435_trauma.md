Teaming up with a hero in waiting, she is drawn into the hunt for a serial killer known as \"The Headhunter\", a hooded killer who has a penchant for decapitation.\r\n\r\nBacked by American dollars for the first time, Dario Argento is in a mischievous mood here. Pumped by Pino Donaggio's chipper musical compositions, Trauma struggles to get the audience to take it seriously as a horror film. Conversely, it's still a bunch of fun, intentionally or otherwise, with the director blending gore and suspense with his playful peccadilloes.\r\n\r\nThe murder scenes are handled with the customary Argento skill, where we even get introduced to what can only be described as Garrote-O-Vision! His camera work quite often borders on the brilliant, but elsewhere the acting is poor across the board and the uneven tone destabilises the pic as a \"horror\" film of substance.\r\n\r\nRoll the dice and take your chance here really. It's fun not scary, bloody yet playful, classy yet amateurish, gotta love those red berries though. 6.5/10"}], "recommandations_id": [39434, 39436, 20115, 27431], "youtube_key": "L4bMdRZ9mUE"}
