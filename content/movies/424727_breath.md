There is less to worry about. But it does not mean the things that are important to us as children have less significance. You see, for Scruffy, despite that she is from a poor family of the countryside, it is very important to study well, because she will become an asthma doctor. The doctor said her dad will die but she has decided - she will grow up and cure her father. Equally important is to run away from her grandmother, who almost always is lurking around in the dark corners of the house with a comb to fix her messy hair. Death is too abstract to understand, war is a word one hears on the radio that grownups sometimes listen to. Yet, as Scruffy lives through her days full of happiness and misery at full steam, the most tumultuous years of Iran become unveiled on the background, as we are introduced to the Revolution and the Iran-Iraqi war through the eyes of a child.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/10aTVccV3OzCvjQs1JmWV7ORZ6n.jpg", "actors": ["Shabnam Moghadami (-)", "Gelare Abasi ()", "Mehran Ahmadi ()", "Jamshid Hashempour ()", "Sareh Nour Mousavi ()", "Pantea Panahiha ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [479067, 436340], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
