On the way, we meet an extraordinary family, a father who trains his son and the most passionate fans in boxing. The film is set against the backdrop of one city; Leeds. Half aspirational professionals and students, half austerity ravaged estates, Leeds is a schizophrenic metaphor for England in 2016. Our boxer bridges the two because this is a city in need of a hero. Can he match and fulfil their hopes and dreams?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6PudtmdQBn2GoBSfkuQEZe9hIdU.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [534011, 561262, 475380, 513360], "youtube_key": "m9JOh4fOyQk"}
