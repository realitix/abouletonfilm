It is an extraordinary place where snow-capped mountains drain into massive rivers and 250 languages are spoken. For centuries, the world has jostled for control of this rugged, isolated region, with its abundant natural resources and strategic position. Through eyewitness accounts and rare archival film, this fascinating documentary paints a picture that is intimate in detail but epic in scope. It is a sweeping saga of colonial ambitions, cold war sellouts and fervent nationalism, which highlights the role of players such as Australia and the UN at crucial points.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bjuQPCllqHFlLMaHoASFlB8mvbY.jpg", "actors": ["Rachel Griffiths (Narrator (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
