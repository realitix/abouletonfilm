Kickstarting with the first Queen performance ever caught on video (1973 in a London rehearsal studio), the concert captures Queen at shows spanning every stage of their carreer, in every corner of the globe they've played, performing songs they seldom played live. And when the band launch into more familiar mainstays of their live repertoire, the versions are taken from never-before seen footage, in some cases their first ever performance of anthems-to-be.
