Aldo pulled out of the bout and a interim championship bout between Chad Mendes and McGregor took place at this event.  The UFC received official medical confirmation from several doctors that Aldo did not have a broken rib as he claimed and the biggest problem was the weight cutting process being complicated by the injury. This was confirmed when a release of an Xray tied to an old injury was released by Aldo's camp.  The co-main event featured a 170 lbs UFC Welterweight Championship bout between current champion Robbie Lawler and top contender Rory MacDonald.  145 lbs: Dennis Bermudez vs. Jeremy Stephens | 170 lbs: Gunnar Nelson vs. Brandon Thatch | 135 lbs.: Thomas Almeida vs. Brad Pickett", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nxTaVjJ8mlU8QskCZqoZaWeUK21.jpg", "actors": ["Conor McGregor (Himself)", "Chad Mendes (Himself)", "Robbie Lawler (Himself)", "Rory MacDonald (Himself)", "Brad Pickett (Himself)", "Thomas Almeida (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
