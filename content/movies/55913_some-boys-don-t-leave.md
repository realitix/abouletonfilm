'Boy' is forced to come to terms with the fact that 'Girl' no longer wants him around. The only problem is he just can't seem to leave their once shared apartment. 'Girl' decides to keep living her life around him; while he remains, watching at a distance. In time, each decides to go in his or her own distinctly different directions. 'Boy' soon finds that sometimes the greatest distance we are asked to travel is one within ourselves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9cWqtlN56Avz7TsZpMfZP9Illlp.jpg", "actors": ["Jesse Eisenberg (The Boy)", "Eloise Mumford (The Girl)", "Jennifer Rau (The Phone Friend)", "Keith Stone (The Braugh)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
