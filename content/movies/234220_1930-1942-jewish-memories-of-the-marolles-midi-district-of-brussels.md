These six adopted \u201cMarollians\u201d are Joseph Berman, David Blum, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Gangarska, Baron Maurice Goldstein, Henri Kichka and Maurice Pioro.  We follow them as they settle into the district. They go on to recount the fateful period from the entry into force of the first anti-Jewish measures in Belgium to the roundups which from 1942 onwards led to their deportation to Auschwitz, where most of the Jews were murdered.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
