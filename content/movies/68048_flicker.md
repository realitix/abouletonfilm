It looks simple enough; a 100-watt light bulb, a motor, and a rotating cylinder with cutouts. Just sit in front of it, close your eyes, and wait for the visions to come. The Dream Machine enthralled mystics and freethinkers everywhere; Kurt Cobain had a dream machine, and William S. Burroughs thought it could be used to \u201cstorm the citadels of enlightenment.\u201d With a custom-made Dream Machine in tow, director Nik Sheehan takes us on a journey into the life of Brion Gysin; his art, his complex ideas, and his friendships with some of the most eccentric counter-cultural icons. Taking the Dream Machine as the basis of its explorations, FLicKeR asks crucial questions about the nature of art and consciousness, and imagines a humanity liberated to explore its creativity in complete freedom.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/VMlgFVyCtqEkQ2xwI9WUAClfi6.jpg", "actors": ["Richard Metzger (Himself)", "Brion Gysin (Himself)", "William S.
