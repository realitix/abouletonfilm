It actually begins at Wolverton with a brief look at the class 319 EMUs\u2019 metamorphosis. Then to Brighton for the start of the 50 minute journey, seen virtually in real time.  At the time of filming in 1998, Connex Expresses ran between the south coast and the capital with just one intermediate stop at East Croydon. The trains then ran non-stop through Haywards Heath, Gatwick Airport and even Clapham Junction! There is a great deal of history crammed into our journey such as the tragic accident in Clayton Tunnel, the tunnel with a house above the castellated portal.  In 1998, Connex held two of the former Southern region franchises but today they have none.
