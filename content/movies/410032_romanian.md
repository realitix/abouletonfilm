The premise of the film - that people are bored and need something to do or perform is beside the point - there are people in Romania who will move an entire orchestra into a cave in the forest and thousands of people will arrive to watch a classical performance there.  Breathtaking and fun at the same time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xowG5diyQG0Sj4aQGX0srC7MPmx.jpg", "actors": ["Constantin Lupu (Dr. Constantin Lupu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "SlPqe8ATGVk"}
