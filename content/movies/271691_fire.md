In the story, a young forest ranger who sees that his work holds the key to the future of his country (through reforestation) is disgusted at the short-sighted, money-grubbing ways of his superiors. He has a much better relationship with local villagers than with his agency's bosses. As the movie opens, the villagers are preparing to hold a hunting ceremony but are not sure whether they will do it the old fashioned way, with a bonfire, or will obey a government decree that open fires are too dangerous. There is a lot of sexual teasing between the villagers, including some harmless horseplay. For instance, when a man whispers another woman's name in his sleep, his wife pours water into his ear in revenge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/om1hKtVnLUNaAKQImouIrGxcKiz.jpg", "actors": ["Djeneba Diawara (Koro)", "Mamadou Fomba ()", "Balla Moussa Keita (Fakoro)", "Diarrah Sanogo (Gnedjougou)", "Fily Traor\u00e9 (Sidy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
