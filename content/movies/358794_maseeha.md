Surajbhan (Mukesh Rishi) is the name of one such despot and Shantinagar is the base of his illegal activities. D.C.P. Shrivastav (Mohan Joshi) and Inspector Thapar (Shiva) are hand-in-glove with him. Krishna (Sunil Shetty) is a victim of Surajbhan's atrocities and has returned from jail after serving a sentence. He learns of Surajbhan's renewed reign of terror and the growth of his illegal activities. How Krishna frees Shantinagar from the clutches of Surajbhan, forms the crux of the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ieQTEN3PBnZa1qLtIV2IwMilP8f.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
