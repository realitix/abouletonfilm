Across six panels, we follow the two men and their fictional counterparts as they race and rescue one another over and over again on a last ride that, thanks to cinema, can extend into infinity. Vin sings a Rihanna ballad to his now fallen friend, who exists within movies but is no longer with us in reality.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8TBVs4nw7w8iyV9poy1YWd5cdW8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
