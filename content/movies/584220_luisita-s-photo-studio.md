Luisita, the youngest, set up there a photo studio where the most renowned artists of the time used to go to take their picture. Today Luisita is far from the recognition she deserves. The discovery of 25,000 never-before-seen negatives brings a new opportunity to get acquainted with the photographer's work and opens a window to a very important period in Argentine popular culture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wI5tZVHDsVIUPbYzRqT1Vf8zYHX.jpg", "actors": ["Luisa Escarria (herself)", "Graciela Escarria (herself)", "Rosa Escarria (herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "tK1b5KjfoI4"}
