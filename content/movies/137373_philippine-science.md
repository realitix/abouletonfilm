They were the top two hundred students from all over the Philippines who passed the examination for the Philippine Science High School, which was created for the purpose of giving an education highly enriched in the Sciences to exceptionally gifted Filipino children. Selected from the best and brightest from all over the country, they endure college-level courses in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics from their sophomore year onwards. Those who can make it are hailed as the future science and technology leaders of the New Republic, those who don't are deemed unfortunate victims of natural selection. They all learn however that they are neither isolated from the real world, nor are they exempted from living real lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qtt3MQ7JcWJZbaf7toIvdp15igM.jpg", "actors": ["Eugene Domingo ()", "Gammy Lopez ()", "Annicka Dolonius ()", "Carl John Barrameda ()", "Elijah Castillo ()", "Shayne Fajutagana ()", "Jonathan Neri ()", "EJ Jallorina ()", "Alfred Labatos ()", "Arnold Reyes ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
