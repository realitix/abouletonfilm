It reveals the vibrant Afro-Cuban culture of the city. In addition, the film unravels the African and Andalusian origins of rumba and follows ordinary people and famous musicians through the dances, drums, and clave rhythm of the genre. The film is a poem of color and music, bringing to the surface the symbolic religious cosmogonies of Bantu, Abakua, Yoruba and Arara traditions that have nourished it. By paying homage to the grand masters of the genre, such as Chano Pozo and his collaborations with Dizzy Gillespie, Rumba Blen Blen Blen is a historical journey that traces the history of rumba in New York through the words and music of scholars, producers, artists and renowned musicians who continue to practice it today.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
