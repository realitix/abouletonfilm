He rarely smiles. His wife Catherine is on the rise as well, as the social engine of his success. They have a son, about eight. Will hits a bump when he meets Kate, a designer of smaller spaces whose work Will has seen (at his son's school). He recommends her for a project, neglects to tell her he's married, and sort of seems available. She falls hard, then meets Catherine and gets a job offer in L.A. Should Will sign with the big firm, go with Catherine on a dream vacation in the Caribbean, and wonder about Kate in L.A.? A flock of birds may hold the answer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sPzLTx5Bn2gbiIgON2u42KsVXSp.jpg", "actors": ["Patrick Wilson (Will)", "Amy Smart (Catherine)", "David Ilku (Pete)", "Susie Stewart Rubio (Meg (as Susan Stewart))", "Stephanie Szostak (Alex)", "Mark Setlock (Sam)", "Lynn Collins (Kate)", "Monique Gabriela Curnen (Janey)", "Frederick Weller (Kit (as Fred Weller))", "Zak Orth (Josh)", "Rashida Jones (Nina)", "Janet Zarish (Pamela)", "Cassidy Hinkle (Gabriella)", "Conor Carroll (Aaron)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
