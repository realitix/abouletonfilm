Challenging social stigmas and featuring an award-winning cast, The Turning is a lesbian horror story filled with powerful performances and some of the most intense girl-on-girl sex ever filmed.  Halle White has never fit in, especially not with her religious foster family. After being pressured to organize a bachelorette for her ungrateful foster sister, she is pushed to the edge of an emotional breakdown and turns to an unusual support counselor for guidance. What happens next will take Halle on a journey of transformation that will ultimately bring her the one thing she has always desired: a family that truly loves and accepts her.  The Turning is a completely new experience in lesbian adult filmmaking and a must-have for any Girlsway fan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tjagbsruKzBRpaYW6MIfOLmtYJL.jpg", "actors": ["Adriana Chechik ()", "Anikka Albrite ()", "Carter Cruise ()", "Dana Vespoli ()", "Jelena Jensen ()", "Lola Foxx ()", "Mercedes Carrera ()", "Sara Luvv ()", "Tara Morgan ()", "Maggie Renault ()", "Bree Mills ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
