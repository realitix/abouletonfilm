In the Fabero coal mine, northern Spain, you can see a 520-tonne Hitachi EX5500 hydraulic excavator making light work of overburden. This beast feeds 200-tonne capacity Cat 789C trucks in just three or four passes. Nearby, a Komatsu D475A dozer \u2013 the biggest in Europe \u2013 is ripping through rock. In footage from mines associated with Fabero you will see other immense hydraulic excavators at work: Komatsu PC3000 and Hitachi EX3600. Among the many supporting machines on view are Komatsu WA800 and WA600 wheeled loaders.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3C4n2574xbZXjZjeFGjtMQbRWLg.jpg", "actors": ["Steven Vale (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
