He pulls out a few to show real-life events caught on camera. He pulls out spools of film that include clips of the effects of heavy rain, of early attempts to fly, of an auto race with a spectacular series of crashes, and, last, of the destruction of a suspension bridge newly-built near Tacoma, buffeted and then ruptured by wind. None of these events were staged, and the camera caught them.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Pete Smith (Narrator)", "Jeff York ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
