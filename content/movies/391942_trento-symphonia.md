An orchestra and a choir, along with a large group of adolescents who act as \"living-music-stands\", are filmed as they play the first part of Mahler\u2019s 8th Symphony. The musicians gradually begin to move in a precise choreography, led by their living-music-stands. As these movements are executed, disparate groups of musicians, singers, and living-music-stands begin to disappear along with the sounds that they emit. The music progressively becomes a sound object captured in the course of its own erosion, which corresponds to the slow dissolution of the landscape\u2019s visibility due to the setting sun. Ultimately, the music as a sound object and the landscape as a visual object become identical, all while being completely transformed in regard to the starting configuration. Thus, in TRENTO SYMPHONIA, the landscape becomes a point of convergence between contemplation, correspondence, and imagination.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vIGk4lZ0GvnKDqQdTdxy93uANFd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
