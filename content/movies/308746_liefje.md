Liefje explores the boundary between reality and fantasy. In a therapeutic session, the 18-year-old Esther reconstructs the murder of her father that she committed with her boyfriend Erik. Flashbacks reveal the facts of the matter. The schoolgirl grows up between quarrelling parents, opposes her mother's uninhibited sexual education and despises her father Robert after he has fathered a twin with his new wife, who is much younger. She tells Erik about a vague memory of her father, allegedly abusing her sexually. Notwithstanding the difference between the gaps in Esther's memory and the facts, the outraged Erik offers her to be her avenger.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7iIUfync87N9OUTxpi1BHFJ4hQP.jpg", "actors": ["Ren\u00e9e Fokker ()", "Ramsey Nasr ()", "Erik van der Horst ()", "Jelka van Houten ()", "Will van Kralingen ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
