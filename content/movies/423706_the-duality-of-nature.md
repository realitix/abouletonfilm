Nature is always a construction, whether in dynamic processes, dis-analog systems or physical, technical signals. 'Nature' formulates the organizational forms of representational strategies - symbolic structures, both in reality and in fiction. Where are the borders, the interfaces, the de-bordering and the analogies for \u2018natural\u2019 nature and \u2018technical\u2019 nature? These considerations provided the basis for the video.\u201d \u2013 VALIE EXPORT", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cDqsOA7NKZzA0FJQqZ7uzMpCIX8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
