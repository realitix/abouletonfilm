Workaholic accountant Peter Andrews (Jason Gedrick) has overlooked Christmas, friends and even his fiance for far too long. As a result, his life begins to fall apart. But a chance encounter with a homeless man named Bob (Tyrone Benskin) changes everything and inspires Peter to start a choir that eventually goes on to enormous success. With the help of the unconventional Sister Agatha (Rhea Perlman) and his new found friends at the shelter, Peter learns that Christmas is not a season but a state of mind and that everyone deserves a second chance at life and love.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5RLjSlhHL4ApTkW8bNHW34Lx3YR.jpg", "actors": ["Jason Gedrick ()", "Tyrone Benskin (Bob)", "Michael Sarrazin (Henry Brockman)", "Marianne Farley (Marilyn)", "Roc LaFortune (Hector)", "John Dunn-Hill (Fred)", "Luis Oliva (Juan)", "Claudia Ferri (Rita)", "Cindy Sampson (Jill Crosby)", "Rhea Perlman (Sister Agatha)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
