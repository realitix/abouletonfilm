When her boyfriend leaves her, she becomes quite hysterical, conjuring up schemes for revenge, contemplating suicide, and so on. These dramatics eventually exasperate her best friend Sophie (Clementine Celarie) so much that she contemplates killing Penelope, her ex-boyfriend, or the two of them together, just to stop the whining.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pUi3oES3jy28YWRvxKKwYpras6g.jpg", "actors": ["Isabelle Adjani ()", "Hippolyte Girardot ()", "Cl\u00e9mentine C\u00e9lari\u00e9 ()", "Fabrice Luchini ()", "Sergio Castellitto ()", "Michel Blanc ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
