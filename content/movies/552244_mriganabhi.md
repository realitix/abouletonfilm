After crossing over her childhood, she is married off to a man who thought wealthy, is crude and egoistic. It is during this phase of womanhood does she realise how restricted she is for being a woman. However, her husband is killed for taking the virginity of a girl from the tea community. She returns to her maternal house with her son and sees herself in a similar situation as her grandmother. Her every action from here on is to create a significant identity for herself and withstand all the hurdles that blow her way.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/94buGiaeWLnGSfVEmbEZ9nc6ViP.jpg", "actors": ["Nipon Goswami ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "jyQOHWJTrRg"}
