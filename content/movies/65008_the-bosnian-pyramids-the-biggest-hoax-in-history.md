They've heard of a man called Semir 'Sam' Osmanagich. He claims to have discovered huge old pyramids, a vast network of underground tunnels and an ancient tumulus. For four and a half days he guided our team around, in search of proof of his claims. The Bosnian Indiana Jones, as Osmanagich is nicknamed, promised to show our camera crew the best places. So it would be definitive once and for all that there really are pyramids in the Bosnian Visoko valley. But are there? Or is it the biggest hoax in history?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p1o5UBGXwzj6CKzYzCFQ3vEN7FT.jpg", "actors": ["Dr. Semir Osmanagich (Himself)", "Dr. Robert M.
