Among other things, Deni told me the story of the foundation of the house, during the slavery period. Among the slaves, there was a priestess from Dahomey, where she used to be a queen, and worshiped African voodoos. Lacking authorization to practice their worship, the slaves hid in a shed, which has become over the years the House of Minas.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f5cG3uH79OqeW6cDweLU3ky21mG.jpg", "actors": ["Deni Prata Jardim (Deni Prata Jardim)", "Hippolyte Brice Sogbossi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
