Then one day Arun brings home a helpful young man named Rajiv Mathur, who has to work in a nearby village as a Welfare Officer. Rajiv is not impressed with Lali's rudeness and chastises her publicly. Subsequently, Rajiv and Lali fall in love with each other and decide to get married, much to the delight of the Chowdhury family, who approve of Rajiv. On the day of the engagement, Lali insults Rajiv, and tells everyone that she only gave her consent to marry him because she wanted to avenge her humiliation at his hands when he had chastised her.
