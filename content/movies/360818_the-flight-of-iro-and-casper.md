He soon learns from expert Dr Luoma, a physicist struggling to win back her reputation due to her wayward theories, that there is more to Iro than meets the eye and that she is arguably a real person, not just a figment of Casper's imagination mimicking his movements and facial expressions. This leads Casper to a journey into the realms of an inverted world that exists behind the mirror to find out who this feminine impostor really is, and to learn about the curious world in which Iro lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/b9682XuYwuhtKdSTiWcGYDmdaLk.jpg", "actors": ["Liam Nooney (Casper)", "Dimitra Barla (Iro)", "Karina Knapinska (Dr. Hannah Luoma)", "Leah Lawry-Johns (Dawn)", "Laila Rose Bouromane (Sandy)", "John Gannon (Mr. Blithe)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
