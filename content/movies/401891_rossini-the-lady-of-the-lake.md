Joyce DiDonato is Elena, the title heroine, who is being pursued by not one, but two tenors\u2014setting off sensational vocal fireworks. Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez is King James V of Scotland, disguised as the humble Uberto, and John Osborn sings his political enemy, and rival in love, Rodrigo Di Dhu. Complicating matters is the fact that Elena herself loves Malcolm, a trouser role sung by mezzo-soprano Daniela Barcellona, and that she is the daughter of Duglas (Oren Gradus), another of the king\u2019s political adversaries. Paul Curran\u2019s atmospheric production is conducted by Michele Mariotti.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jLe47dVaiiM0jh9NLOblzNfjHVu.jpg", "actors": ["Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez (Giacomo V)", "Joyce DiDonato (Elena)", "John Osborn (Rodrigo di Dhu)", "Daniela Barcellona (Malcolm Groeme)", "Oren Gradus (Douglas d'Angus)", "Olga Makarina (Albina)", "Eduardo Valdes (Serano)", "Gregory Schmidt (Bertram)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "HpMWJVPWOTQ"}
