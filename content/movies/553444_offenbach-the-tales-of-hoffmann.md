Hoffmann, with a sprinkling of Goethe\u2019s Faust, portrays the German poet as both narrator and hero recounting his love affairs with Olympia, Antonia and Giuletta. Robert Carsen\u2019s spectacular production highlights the melancholy genius of a man marked by life, with a coherence and dramatic sense remarkable for a work that leaves numerous questions unanswered. Under the baton of Philippe Jordan, St\u00e9phanie d\u2019Oustrac, Ermonela Jaho, Kate Aldrich, Yann Beuron and Ram\u00f3n Vargas and Stefano Secco in the main role, interpret the legendary airs of this work whose brilliant mystery will continue to dazzle opera houses for countless years to come.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k1CcWaHJADVcHBpG7k4tlvdRGYJ.jpg", "actors": ["Ram\u00f3n Vargas (Hoffmann)", "Nadine Koutcher (Olympia)", "Kate Aldrich (Giulietta)", "Ermonela Jaho (Antonia)", "Philippe Jordan (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "0fVgERIrM6Q"}
