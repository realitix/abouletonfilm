In his search for funds, Buck meets Patricia Harper, the fourth-richest girl in the world, but he isn't aware of that and thinks she is penniless. Patricia joins his troupe as a lark, and her father, James Harper, also pretends he is broke. Through some chicanery, Buck gets jobs for the girls as models at the Palace of Feminine Arts at the Paris International Exposition. James Harper borrows the priceless Napoleaon necklace to have a copy made for his daughter, but Buck thinks he stole it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f6GvwOqI0arT6TbmBqjCpEUEe0x.jpg", "actors": ["Jack Benny (Buck Boswell)", "Joan Bennett (Patricia Harper)", "Mary Boland (Mrs. Isabel Channing)", "Charley Grapewin (James Harper)", "Fritz Feld (Dubois)", "Phyllis Kennedy (Marie)", "Monty Woolley (Gantvoort)", "G.P.
