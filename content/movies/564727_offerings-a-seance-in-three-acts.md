Non-narrative and highly textured, the film functions as a distillation of folk horror imagery and expressionist filmmaking techniques. Largely inspired by underground album artwork and xeroxed gig posters, the costumed creatures found in Offerings function largely as black metal album illustration brought to hulking, lumbering life. A visual and aural assault, Offerings seeks to hypnotize and indoctrinate its audience into its fever dream nightmarescape.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4uIg1Bp54bRwk6tzNbl1bIlQsUO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
