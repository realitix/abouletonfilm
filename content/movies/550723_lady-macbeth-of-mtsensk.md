The heroine is the daughter-in-law of Boris, a greedy, lecherous merchant, and the frustrated wife of his impotent son. Katerina poisons Boris and when her husband returns she and her lover, Sergei, kill him too, burying him in the cellar. The body is discovered during their wedding party. Haunted by guilt, Katerina confesses and the newlyweds are consigned to Siberia. When Sergei takes up with another woman, Katerina pushes her into the river and then jumps in herself.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ce8UkfUTLkqFViEQvBNToO6DEJR.jpg", "actors": ["Berczelly Istv\u00e1n ()", "Rudolf P\u00e9ter Kiss ()", "Luk\u00e1cs Gy\u00f6ngyi ()", "Vadim Zapletchni ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
