They don't have millions of dollars to waste on padding or special effects, but they still manage to pull off their stunt, with little or NO BUDGET! Two crazy brothers, a pro BMX rider, pro skateboarder, pro wrestler, gymnast with balls of steel, blonde bombshell model, and a NO-LEGGED amputee recreate their favorite stunt scenes step-by-step. First you watch the stunt straight from the film, and then the Hollywood Stunt Dummy re-enactment and see how similar they actually are. Props, wardrobe, camera-angles. They even imitate the acting... well, at least try!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/akH2EIsE6kRrHIlZOgS5L4A0QsR.jpg", "actors": ["Mike Gaboff (Crazy Mike)", "Ryan Gaboff (Flyin' Ryan)", "Sean Logan (Himself)", "Zac Gordon (The Horse)", "Leroy Patterson (Himself)", "Ryan Simonetti (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
