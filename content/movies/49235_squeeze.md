A small gang of older tough guys, led by Marcus and Tommy, menace them, and when the PG-13s fight back and rob one of the gang, Marcus and Tommy vow to kill them. They seek protection from Derick, a drug dealer, who agrees to help if they'll sell drugs. Meanwhile, Ty is recruited to work at a community center by J.J., its quiet leader. Ty and his friends are in a squeeze: surrounded by violence, drugs, and no opportunities, is there any way out?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/iifSS4xn1rnkYhICYXUwbF3BF5h.jpg", "actors": ["Tyrone Burton (Tyson)", "Eddie Cutanda (Hector)", "Phuong Duong (Bao)", "Geoffrey Rhue (JJ)", "Russell G.
