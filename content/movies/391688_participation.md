It is a sort of summary of Steina and Woody Vasulka's first creative period, a period of fascination with the more bizarre aspects of \"new American decadence\". Thanks to the video camera and its revolutionary implications, the creators were able to penetrate into spheres where the documentarists of more classical media were neither allowed nor interested to enter thereby helping to expand the ideas of documentary possibilities.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
