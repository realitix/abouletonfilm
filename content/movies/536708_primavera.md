In the midst of her meagre existence she suddenly receives the news that she has been chosen to be Queen of the Spring. She is going to wear a magnificent white dress and her hair gets decorated. A flurry of excitement accompanies the outlandish coronation ceremony. Dayana is enthroned on a stage, surrounded by a bevy of similarly clad princesses of the same age. Afterwards, she dances with Walter, her Spring Groom in a suit and tie. The couple do not look particularly happy. Told in a series of long takes, the film provides a close and intense glimpse of another world far away. No explanation is provided and so the proceedings remain a mystery.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wTitqZM4UTEwZnZhhn87laIAUr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
