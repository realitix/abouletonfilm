Jackie McKenzie (Candi Evens) and Lt. Doug 'Zapper' Curtis (Steve Drake) square off at the prestigious First Team Fighter School. Their aerial stunts heat up the heavens, but on the ground, everything Zapper does rubs Jackie the wrong way? Like when he gets caught watching her rub herself the right way, or devouring a piece of Candy (her sexy stripper roommate).
