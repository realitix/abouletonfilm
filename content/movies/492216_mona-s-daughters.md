It's been years since Brigitte has seen her sister Candide or their recently-deceased mother, though when she is called on to sing at the funeral her since of duty supercedes any lingering family conflicts. But it's obvious that Candide harbors a lingering grudge, and as the alienated sisters come together in grief at their mother's country home unspoken hostilities gradually simmer to the surface. Both siblings are noted singer songwriters; Candide specializing in a more delicate brand of acoustic ballads and Brigitte using her talents to exorcise a lingering inner rage. The history of their relationship is written in Candide's lyrics, providing remarkable insight into the sibling's stormy relationship. Eventually, Brigitte discovers a tape of her mother's old music, leading the two sisters to collaborate on a song that could finally help to begin the healing process.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/p4oe8v1K3bT1NVmTXAsuX9g9fYz.jpg", "actors": ["Viviane Audet ()", "Marie Neige Chatelain ()", "Joanie Allard ()", "St\u00e9phane Michaud ()", "Gilles-Vincent Martel ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
