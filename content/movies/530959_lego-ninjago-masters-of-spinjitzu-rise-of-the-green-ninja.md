The four Ninja must train Lloyd for his confrontation with his father, but with limited powers and without a home, it proves more difficult than they could have imagined. And Lloyd is not exactly an A-student either. Garmadon is bent on preventing Lloyd meeting his full potential. He unleashes a series of devious plots including the ultimate Mega weapon, enemy pirates, dark replicas of the four ninjas and a dangerous race across Ninjago.
