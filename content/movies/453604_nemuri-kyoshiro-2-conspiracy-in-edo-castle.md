Kyoshiro, who has come back in Edo after 3 years is involved in it against his will. It's because he gets to know Lady Mihoyo who is a spy for Sakai and looks exactly like his late mother.  As she couldn't complete her mission she has nowhere to go. Kyoshiro shelters her from both parties that seek her life. The original story is from \"Nemuri Kyoshiro Burai Hikae\" written by Shibata Renzaburo. Not only is one of Japan's greatest legends kept alive, but some secrets of Kyoshiro's past are finally revealed for the first time.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s945SdW5XQmSqvcKJ8pcNHAJZ8q.jpg", "actors": ["Katsuhiko Watabiki ()", "Masahiko Tsugawa ()", "Masakazu Tamura (Nemuri Kyoshiro)", "Keiko Takeshita ()", "Shinobu Sakagami ()", "Tokuma Nishioka ()", "Kaori Koshiba ()", "Takao Ito ()", "Renji Ishibashi ()", "Kimiko Ikegami ()", "Hirotaro Honda ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
