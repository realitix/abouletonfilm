Of course, this means Tom will spend most of the picture chasing Jerry around the house, causing extensive damage. Among the sequences: Jerry shoves Tom into a VCR, then shelves the resulting cassette-sized cat; Tom traps Jerry in a coffeemaker; Jerry traps Tom in a refrigerator, and he comes out again in ice cubes; Jerry sucks Tom and half the living room into a vacuum cleaner; Tom chases Jerry through the yard and into the house on a riding lawn mower. At the end, he crashes the mower into his owner's returning car, and is told he makes a better hood ornament than a house cat.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sM3X2e4RNVKgRm6VcJKuI8Owylf.jpg", "actors": ["Joseph Barbera (Homeowner)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [224059, 223032], "youtube_key": "DXbexlBP5QI"}
