It's not long after the 'summer of love', early 70's, the Age of Aquarius, social growth, political awareness and unrest. Freedom is the byword of existence and Chris, Liam, & Manny are floating aimlessly in this youth-fueled counter culture.

Through the trials and tribulations of their journey, they come to discover who they are as individuals and what they really want in life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tG8NUJGWhVI3LlTa8MRug3c4WrJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "284255847"}
