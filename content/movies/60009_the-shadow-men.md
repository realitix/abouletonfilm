That's not to say the film is bad -- it isn't. It's not great either. It's just... *Meh*\r\n\r\nThere were opportunities in the script for curve balls to be thrown at the audience, but the filmmakers declined. They stuck to the formula, never veered off the path of familiarity, and gave us the plot completely by the numbers. This is the type of movie that you can flip on at any time and not really pay attention, never having to worry if you'll miss any key plot points.\r\n\r\nI'm a fan of Eric Roberts and find him enjoyable in even the worst of movies, so having him in the cast definitely helped.\r\n\r\nAnd kudos to the filmmakers for playing off the ridiculously awful alien costumes for realism. They looked awful, but worked in that \"so cheesy it's fun\" sort of way."}], "recommandations_id": [112328]}
