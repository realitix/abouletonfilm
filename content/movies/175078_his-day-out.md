In this film, West escapes a couple of cops, and fights for the Mabel Normand imitation with Oliver Hardy (who in this film is an Eric Campbell imitation). The dynamic between West in Hardy is more Popeye and Bluto (without the funny gags). The only original jokes involve our heroine's romantic assaults on Hardy's mustache.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Billy West (Billy)", "Leatrice Joy (Joy)", "Oliver Hardy (Ollie)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
