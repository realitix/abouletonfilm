These include the Marikana massacre in August 2012, whereby 34 striking miners were gunned down by the ANC government's police force. Rehad Desai documented this historic event in his 2013 film MINERS SHOT DOWN. He refers to the incident once again in his latest film and shows how the ANC is undermining its close connections to the trade unions it set up as a freedom movement under Nelson Mandela, and how students have also turned on the party to protest against tuition fees under the motto #FeesMustFall. The film's compelling footage unmasks the cynical despotism of corrupt president Jacob Zuma, who is chiefly responsible for the ANC's demise and its catastrophic losses at the most recent elections. It also introduces opposition movements that are challenging his now-untenable position.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cfZweVuYoF36oqhZtzZUcapKp3a.jpg", "actors": ["Jacob Zuma (himself)", "Julius Malema (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
