In a kind of homage to Kurosawa's 7 Samurai, the  townspeople have been unable to defend themselves and Inaba sets out to teach  them how to stand up for themselves.  Meanwhile the vile Lord Yasumasa has sent  the 4 finest swordsmen in the clan out to hunt Inaba down and kill him.  Led by the  magnificent Ichibei (Konoe), a master of weaponry in his own right, everything points  to an ultimate showdown between the former friends in a battle to the death.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/26U1rSgtsmpkj7RssSalqF96Lwd.jpg", "actors": ["Ryutaro Otomo (Yajuro Inaba)", "Miyuki Sasa ()", "Ch\u00f4j\u00fbr\u00f4 Kawarasaki (Sasuke)", "Satomi Oka (Nana)", "J\u00fbshir\u00f4 Konoe (Ichibei)", "Kei Sat\u014d (Katsumaki)", "Masao Mishima ()", "Kamatari Fujiwara (Miyuki Sasa)", "Jotaro Togami ()", "Yoshiko Yashioji ()", "K\u00f4ji Kiyomura ()", "Hideo Hongo (Kankichi)", "Toyo Takahashi ()", "Kinji Nakamura ()", "Shunya Wazaki ()", "Shinnosuke Ogata ()", "Keiko Ogasawara ()", "Akira Shioji ()", "Kenji Kusumoto ()", "Masataka Iwao ()", "Haruko Izumi ()", "Masako Nakane ()", "Kentaro Ozato ()", "Kensaku Haruji ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
