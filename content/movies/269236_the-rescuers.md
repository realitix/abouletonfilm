While Nyombayire embarks upon this quest in an effort to uncover potential solutions for the ongoing genocide in Darfur and elsewhere, what emerges from their journey is more a testament to the ways in which the inherent good in the human spirit can trump institutional evil no matter what the circumstance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yOpslIYDQ7fqMh0dqyy5FXM9b9v.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
