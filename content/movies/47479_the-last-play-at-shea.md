Shea Stadium was closed (in part to create more parking space for a new stadium, Citi Field), and on July 16 and 18, 2008, Billy Joel headlined the final concerts held at the stadium. Filmmaker Paul Crowder and a camera crew were on hand for Joel's shows, and the documentary THE LAST PLAY AT SHEA chronicles his historic two-night stand, as well as exploring Joel's career, his ties to working-class New York, and how his life and career paralleled the growth of suburban Long Island and the beloved ballpark.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jXML1KnswYnSHTs7w4XNFc3GCPD.jpg", "actors": ["Alec Baldwin ()", "Tony Bennett ()", "Garth Brooks ()", "Roger Daltrey ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
