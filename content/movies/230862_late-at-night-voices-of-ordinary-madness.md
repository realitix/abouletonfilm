Herself an immigrant to the area, Guo\u2019s sensitive character studies hint at an affinity with the push and pull of feelings of alienation, a theme she has previously explored as a filmmaker (She a Chinese, LFF 2009) and novelist (A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary for Lovers). This empathy is also apparent in her playful stylistic approach that layers Warhol-esque news reports, archival material and a soundtrack including Linton Kwesi Johnson and Fela Kuti, to comment on the human cost of capitalism. The resulting film is both a penetrating portrait of a frenetic place that feels deeply authentic, and a powerful piece of protest film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wmthVSzgs8bOrbhcCwGnIIqgg1h.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "tiBrbkUWZuE"}
