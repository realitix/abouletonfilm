Each chapter has a topic of its own and develops a unique visual style.  All parts are connected by a certain theme: the conjunctive concept of the film is the idea of universal transformation and movement, which is represented in the animals. The artists follow the surrealist credo that everything is linked with everything else in a hidden way. The only way to uncover these links is art. With its irresistible synthetic dynamics, the film reveals these secret connections.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/S2zxMY7ecqnhP403xW4GByHShI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "R7EQiHl5V0g"}
