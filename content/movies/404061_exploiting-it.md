Through these women\u2019s perspectives we see an unexpected form of oppression that contradicts and challenges the misinformed view that these women are in fact oppressed by their faith. Furthermore, this short film offers an insight into how governmental legislation, such as Prevent and the Counter Terrorism and Security Bill, is seeping into different areas of life and institutionalising racist stereotypes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5JibRX7PE8XYyaiYTvO4coCyRlZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
