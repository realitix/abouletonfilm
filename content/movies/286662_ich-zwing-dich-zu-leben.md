At school, the dutiful Gr\u00fcbler, a member of the NSDAP, teaches his pupils to volunteer for military service, but when his own son volunteers for the Waffen SS, he is nevertheless shocked and fears for his boy\u2032s life. But Wolfgang starts to hate his father for his doubts: He thinks his father is a coward. In his desperation, Gr\u00fcbler chains and kidnaps his son to hide him in a dugout in the forest until the end of the war. In their shelter, father and son are fighting bitterly but when the Nazis who still believe in the \"Endsieg\" discover their hideout, Gr\u00fcbler sacrifices his life to save Wolfgang.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tEAw58qfrquvDnC1mGA2hCVwfuj.jpg", "actors": ["Rolf Ludwig (Lehrer Gr\u00fcbler)", "Peter Welz (Sohn Wolfgang)", "Robert Pfeiffer (Direktor Heschke)", "Horst Kotterba (F\u00e4hnleinf\u00fchrer Wulf)", "Dieter Bellmann (Fl\u00fcchtiger Landser)", "Anne-Else Paetzold ()", "Eberhard Kirchberg ()", "Erich Mirek ()", "Elsa Grube-Deister ()", "Dorothea Garlin ()", "K\u00e4te Koch ()", "Doris Schmude ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
