Shot by the legendary Henri Alekan (WINGS OF DESIRE, BELLE ET LA BETE), the film revisits JOHNNY GUITAR\u2019S query as to whether or not relationships once interrupted can be revived under the right circumstances. In rather reflexive fashion, de Kuper casts Howard Hensel as Michael, a 40-something film professor, who falls in love with one of his students. When the two take off to London for a weekend, Michael uncovers that his student\u2019s father is in fact his former lover from 15 years prior. With its deliberate dialogue and restrained camerawork, A STRANGE LOVE AFFAIR captures the reticence and taboos surrounding not only gay love affairs, but also those hampered by the passage of time.\" - Spectacle Theater", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Howard Hensel (Michael)", "Lieke Leo (Linda)", "Ben van Os (Ben)", "Ann Petersen (Caf\u00e9bezitster)", "Pascale Petit (Ann)", "Karl Scheydt (Jim)", "Sep Van Kampen (Chris)", "Jacqueline Veuve (Maria)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
