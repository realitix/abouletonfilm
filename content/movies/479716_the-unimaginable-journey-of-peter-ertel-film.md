This film combines re-creation storytelling with Ertel\u2019s own brave recounting of his harrowing years in the Nazi army, meeting his wife\u2019s family (also members of the German resistance), surviving the Russian Winter, and then being accepted into a Jewish company in Ohio. Ertel grew up with a poet\u2019s mind and an artist\u2019s curiosity, and this film conveys these sensibilities\u2014the very traits that saved his life on so many occasions\u2014with a tale so bold, brave, and beautiful it will restore your faith that humanity can survive even the darkest of days.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
