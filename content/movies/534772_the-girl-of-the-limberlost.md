This time out, Elnora Comstock (Dorinda Clifton) lives on the edge of a great swamp and collects butterflies to sell in order to go to high school and pay for violin lessons. Her mother, Kate Comstock (Ruth Nelson), hates her as she blames the girl for the father's death as he drowned in a quagmire on the way home the night the girl was born. The years-late revelation that the husband had been off courting a neighbor woman that night brings an attitude adjustment to the mother.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gz2dOtEDFP3UOlhgiB94gKPr57w.jpg", "actors": ["Ruth Nelson (Kate Comstock)", "Dorinda Clifton (Elnora Comstock)", "Loren Tindall (Pete Reed)", "Gloria Holden (Miss Nelson)", "Ernest Cossart (Roger Henley)", "Vanessa Brown (Helen Brownlee)", "James Bell (Wesley Sinton)", "Joyce Arling (Margaret Sinton)", "Charles Arnt (Hodges)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
