Halfway through this 70-minute film, the camera pans down to reveal the back of another man's head. Zooms and more pans follow, yet each blocky, high-contrast composition has an assertive power characteristic of Warhol.\" - Fred Camper", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Gregory Battcock (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
