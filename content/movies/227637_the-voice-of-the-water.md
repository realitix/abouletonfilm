Water in its soothing form, as a place of work and pleasure and as a source of threat and misery. Bert Haanstra thought it a great subject for a big cinema documentary and made The Voice of the Water. At the start, while the credits are still running, it is already apparent how remarkable and original he portrays the beauty of the landscape of the Dutch coastline. In the following ninety minutes we see numerous people that live, work and recreate on, by and in the water. Often they are being observed in a gentle humorous way that reminds us of The Human Dutch. Some people prefer to stay far away from all the wetness: the little boy having a swimming lesson, but who doesn\u2019t dare to put his head under water, is forever imprinted on the memory of many of the viewers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/PBq3fJXrPCZghEZ4vludeyzXN9.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
