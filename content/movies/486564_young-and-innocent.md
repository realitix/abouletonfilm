Alone and friendless, she holes up in a nowhere motel, ignoring the nagging calls from her sister and indulging in utter anonymity. There Marion meets Norman, and each is haunted by the feeling that they\u2019ve met the other before. Like a garage band covering a string quartet, freshman director Jesse Robinson rebuilds Psycho from a looser, warmer material. Young and Innocent throws a haze across Hitchcock\u2019s spartan menace, replacing autumnal chill with summer swelter, and adult frailty with the languageless longings of adolescence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dH6uLakOA1X8c8z3vpmUcUE1Pyr.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
