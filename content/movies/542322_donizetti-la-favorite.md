This maestro, a bel canto specialist, captured the fire and intensity of the passions from the get-go, making the overture a superbly eloquent transition to a musical world based on beautiful lines and colors that elaborate distress and make it compellingly elegant. Allemandi demonstrated a full authority over the stage for the musically complex scenes, and in the arias and duets he demonstrated his confidence in the artistry of distraught singers by establishing ample tempos to support their soaring vocal lines while he concentrated on pulling every possible nuance from the pit players.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/audiWhmdSV5q6C6256PJe9gBs6R.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
