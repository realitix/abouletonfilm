And to make things more difficult, the horny minister can't remember which room he left it in.  After several incidents in different hotel rooms, neither secretary has found a thing.  There's not a trace of the portfolio; but Clemens is more interested in Annette, the young lady in one of the hotel beds, than in the portfolio.  He forgets his mission and can think only of her.  Boni, in the meantime, has found his way into a room, where Olivia is staying and sees a red, leather folder there.  But the woman throws him out in short order.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Johannes Heesters (Clemens Vern\u00e9)", "Theo Lingen (Bonifatius 'Boni' Zeck)", "Christl Mardayn (Olivia)", "Inge List (Annette)", "Will Dohm (Alexander Pilat Ravestyn)", "Max G\u00fclstorff (Hotelarzt)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
