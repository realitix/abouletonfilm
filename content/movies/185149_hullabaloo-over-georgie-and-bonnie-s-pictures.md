Peggy Ashcroft and Larry Pine star as two rapacious art collectors who come to the decaying Art Deco palace of a young Maharaja (Victor Banerjee) to examine a legendary collection of Indian miniature paintings. While vying with each other to get the pictures away from the royal couple\u2014nicknamed Georgie and Bonnie as children by their Scottish governess\u2014they must also divine the true motives of the Indian curator of the collection (Saeed Jaffrey), who, in league with the Maharaja\u2019s beautiful sister (Aparna Sen), may be working against them. Amidst the backdrop of lavish tourist entertainments, Christmas parties, fireworks, and even an English ghost, a desperate game of palace intrigue will determine the ultimate resting place of the priceless paintings.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ss3OX4PIgDJfYcO0YzpFqvVMgRn.jpg", "actors": ["Peggy Ashcroft (Lady Gee)", "Larry Pine (Clark Haven)", "Saeed Jaffrey (Sri Narain)", "Victor Banerjee (Georgie)", "Aparna Sen (Bonnie)", "Jane Booker (Lynn)", "Jins Shamsudin (Deaf Mute)", "Jenny Beavan (Governess)", "Aladdin Langa (Servant)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
