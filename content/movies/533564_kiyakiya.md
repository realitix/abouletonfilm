When I was a child, there was a book I always used to read when I went to the hospital. One day as I was reading it as I always did, suddenly the ending had changed. Sometime later, when I read it again, it had returned to normal.\r \u2014  In our everyday routine, there are moments when suddenly we feel like something is different; this unexpected change, like in my memory, feels like it has a kind of reality. This impression is at the core of \u201cKiyaKiya\u201d and the related painting and drawing series.\r \u2014", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rEmCg9pgN2PPSsLkAADrrP3Kl35.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
