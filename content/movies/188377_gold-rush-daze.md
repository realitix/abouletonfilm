The man at the station tells him what it was like back in 1849 in San Francisco, which we see. A sucker is hauled off the street and sat down at a card game; he dashes off as soon as someone shouts \"they found gold in the hills\" but others stake claims before he can. He ends up chopping off a cliff, falling down, and landing in the hospital. The doctor gives him news of another gold strike and he rushes out to begin panning. After some more mining gags and a song, we see a montage of more failed gold strikes. Back to the present day, where the storyteller claims to have sworn off gold, until a rider passes through with news of another strike, when he trades the station for the car and sets out after the gold.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2GNj7Ge3yG3ZT7f286qYfRMcMTY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
