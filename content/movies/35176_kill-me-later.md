Before she can leap, she's taken hostage by Charlie Anders, a fleeing bank robber. He and his partners have stolen a million in cash and plan to escape to Venezuela. Shawn agrees to cooperate if Charlie promises to kill her once he's in the clear. Parts of the plan go awry, so Charlie has time to try to pierce her bleak manner and self pity, and she has time for reflection. As night falls, their interlude ends: they're each alone, Charlie facing prison as the police close in, and Shawn staring down at a river from atop a high bridge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jWd0LUXsJ2DkgJWbJRnDk3ZZ0G8.jpg", "actors": ["Selma Blair (Shawn Holloway)", "Max Beesley (Charlie Anders)", "O'Neal Compton (Agent McGinley)", "Lochlyn Munro (Agent Reed)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [45069, 35004, 33582, 70877], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
