The hero Pali (Zoltan Bezeredi) arrives back in Budapest from the U.S. and meanders among the intellectual and social elite before he leaves for a brief stay in England. There he has an even briefer affair with a happy-go-lucky aspiring actress (Anna Kubik), and after a few other encounters with movie mavens, he heads back to Budapest -- quite inexplicably. The rest of the film deteriorates into a dark realm of hatred and violence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eDZeaspQmo2P0RPe2Dwf624xigk.jpg", "actors": ["Zolt\u00e1n Bezer\u00e9di ()", "Dezs\u0151 Garas ()", "Anna Kubik ()", "T\u00f6r\u0151csik Mari ()", "Major Tam\u00e1s ()", "Gyula Benk\u00f6 ()", "J\u00e1nos G\u00e1lv\u00f6lgyi ()", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 M\u00e1rkus ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
