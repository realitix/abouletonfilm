Taking cues from Blade Runner, utilizing a similar soundtrack and dark theme, this movie is well worth watching if you are into sci-fi and time travel movies in particular.\r\n\r\nIs the beautiful woman good or bad? Are the time travel rules what everyone believes them to be? You may think you have everything pretty well figured out by mid movie, but the ending will leave you with some unanswered questions that have you scouring discussion boards."}], "recommandations_id": [376292, 137333, 301729, 410199]}
