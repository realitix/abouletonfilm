A \"Storm P. Invention\" is how Danes would describe a highly complicated technical design. The design of these apparatuses reflects an original satirical view on a society obsessed by efficiency and technocratization. The fun is derived from the lack of proportion between the diminutive scale of the problem and incomprehensible complexity of Storm P.'s solution.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kFUYI6QMZkvOGCjZlEfDE51KSj7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
