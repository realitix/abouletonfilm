Diagnosed with the disease in 1991, Said struggled with his leukemia throughout the 1990s before refraining from interviews due to his increasingly fragile physical state. This interview was the one sole exception to his staunch \"no interview\" policy, and provides fascinating insight into the mind of the man who became Western society's most prominent spokesman for the Palestinian cause.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5nsPX2IkF0vxkwYj6q4xS72DBUx.jpg", "actors": ["Edward Said ()", "Charles Glass (narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
