I felt like his character is how he is in real life a little. Pierce Brosnan. Handsome as always. Although I really didn't like his character at first, I have to say, paid off in the end. Robert's sister in the movie was great. You just gotta love her character. How can you not? \r\n\r\nThis is not a heavy drama movie. It's just right. Of course I didn't really like the love interest of Robert in this movie. I mean she kissed him, made love to him (even if it's fake but still!!!), she's a lucky girl and I don't like it. I don't like the ending. It's not really what we call a very happy ending. But even if it's a not-so-happy ending, it still turned out to be a good ending with the things that happened to the characters in the end.\r\n\r\nMy grade for this movie, B. I recommend it to all Robert Pattinson fans (which I think you've all seen this movie already), people who like love stories, family stories, not-so-heavy-drama movie."}], "recommandations_id": [22971, 77877, 35690, 55787]}
