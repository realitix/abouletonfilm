Set in the Dakotas during the days of the Great Gold Boom, the story finds brothers Jim and Bob Holliday (Stack and Broderick Crawford) dukeing it out over the affections of pretty Anne Grayson (Ann Rutherford). While all this is going on, Wild Bill Hickok (Richard Dix) does his best to neutralize the local criminal element-and to fend off the romantic overtures of boisterous Calamity Jane (Frances Farmer).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rCTZCqe7mFFN3Dsrd8J7Y8o8rbC.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Stack (Jim Holliday)", "Ann Rutherford (Anne Grayson)", "Richard Dix (James Butler \"Wild Bill\" Hickok)", "Frances Farmer (Calamity Jane)", "Broderick Crawford (Bob Holliday)", "Hugh Herbert (Rocky Plummer)", "Andy Devine (Spearfish)", "Lon Chaney Jr. (Jack McCall)", "Fuzzy Knight (Hurricane Harry)", "Addison Richards (Gen.
