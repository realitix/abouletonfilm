Unfortunately, that gift is a coffin with an embalmed body inside that happens to be a mummy that also happens to turn into a vampire during the next full moon. If you're wondering why then the Thai title translates to 'The Zombie' when this features a mummy vampire, you may want to ask Google Translate. Otherwise, this is a horror comedy with bad gay jokes and a soundtrack of stolen Culture Club music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kJD0a1RdxqFO2mC29atNaalfVYM.jpg", "actors": ["Lor Tok ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
