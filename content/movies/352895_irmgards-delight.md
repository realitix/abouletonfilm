He must get over that buck in front of him. And there's yet another obstacle right behind that: a basketball net. Who misses the net, gets to clean up. Van Vloten fails miserably. But when the gym teacher leaves, Han grabs the ball, acts like a professional basketball player and... fails again. A girl takes notice of him, she seems interested.
