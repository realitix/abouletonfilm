Robert Preston (William Haines) is a high powered publicity agent for Superba Pictures. He is determined in making his sweetheart June Dale (Judith Allen) a star by pulling all manner of publicity stunts. However in doing so he fails to fulfil her romantic needs and becomes enamoured with the older and wealthier John Miljan. Preston has to pull out the stunts to win her back.\r\n\r\nThe film has some silly jokes, song and dance number with  appearances by the Wampas girls. Each year a group of up and coming actresses were hailed as stars of the future. There is a segment where the Wampas girls were accompanied by guys wearing masks of then famous film stars such as Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
