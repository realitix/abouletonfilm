Played by Rock Stevens (we'll just bet) that's his real name, Goliath comes to the aid of one King Selim. The villains have appropriated Selim's throne, and the Big One endeavors to get it back. Mario Petri costars in this Eastmancolor extravaganza. Goliath at the Conquest of Damascus was issued to television as part of the \"Sons of Hercules\" package.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aqQA3AaEQpVNcZPI6mNdYuNt7uI.jpg", "actors": ["Peter Lupus (Goliath (as Rock Stevens))", "Mario Petri (Yssour)", "Helga Lin\u00e9 (Fatma)", "Arturo Dominici (Kaichev)", "Piero Lulli (Thor)", "Anna Maria Polani (Myriam)", "Marino Mas\u00e9 (Phir)", "Daniele Vargas (Saud)", "Mino Doro (King Selim)", "Andrea Aureli (Bhalek)", "Nello Pazzafini (Horval)", "Dario Michaelis (Safawidi)", "Fedele Gentile (Selim's Officer)", "Ignazio Balsamo (Messenger)", "Bernardina Sarrocco ((as Berna Rock))", "Mirko Valentin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
