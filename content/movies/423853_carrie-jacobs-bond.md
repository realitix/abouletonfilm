Hill narrates the story of one of America's most successful woman composers, Carrie Jacobs-Bond, who is seen in silent film footage. Mrs. Bond is shown, at age 71, playing with her two dogs, walking with friends and practicing the piano at home. Her songs, which were phenomenally popular in the early 20th century, are sung off screen by 34-year-old radio baritone Ralph Kirbery, known in the early 1930s as \"The Dream Singer.\" The songs are \"A Perfect Day\" (1910), \"Just a Wearyin' for You\" (1901) and \"I Love You Truly\" (1906).", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Edwin C.
