After four years, they return for the last time to find out about their system's failures, repair it and hand it over at last. The film follows them through chaotic days as well as pitch black nights and provides a fresh insight into the pitfalls of humanitarian development projects.\r Short circuits of all sorts, blending and dissolving of different worlds, rituals of gratitude and concepts of solutions. With no attempts to declare or evaluate anything, Solar Eclipse becomes a situation probe examining various forms of light and darkness. Will the two Czech linkboys succeed in lighting up the Zambian bushland?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/48fFtp2ebxcLXwq5iP6GaCPJaKH.jpg", "actors": ["Tom\u00e1\u0161 To\u017ei\u010dka (Himself)", "Milan Smr\u017e (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "31522835"}
