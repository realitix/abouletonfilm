These were the originals who lit the flame 50 years ago, and set fire to the world of folk music.  For the filming of this DVD, hundreds of old photographs were assembled; audio and video clips were retrieved from the archives to capture the spirit of the group down through the decades. Projected performances from the past played an integral role in this celebration concert. The atmosphere was electric, with music, stories and poetry flowing from reservoirs of memory \u2014 a unique collaboration between the original group and the current line-up, a perfect party to celebrate 50 years.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wz59WvCHxQwWtcrSbuwfIERVMqN.jpg", "actors": ["Ci\u00e1ran Bourke (Himself - The Dubliners)", "Eamonn Campbell (Himself - The Dubliners)", "Se\u00e1n Cannon (Himself - The Dubliners)", "Ronnie Drew (Himself - The Dubliners)", "Luke Kelly (Himself - The Dubliners)", "Jim McCann (Himself - The Dubliners)", "Barney McKenna (Himself - The Dubliners)", "John Sheahan (Himself - The Dubliners)", "Patsy Watchorn (Himself - The Dubliners)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
