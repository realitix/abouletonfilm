Based on eye-witness accounts, this film reveals what went on below decks in the hours before the Titanic sank, telling the previously relatively unheralded stories of engineers who fought courageously to hold back the power of the sea and keep the power systems running, even when they learned that all was lost.  Most of these men died but their actions bought enough time to save many lives.  This drama-documentary tells a poignant story of self-sacrifice by the Titanic's engineers, stokers and firemen in the face of impending death.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sAVXxt25jEHILAI3s9EGXWmY889.jpg", "actors": ["Liam Cunningham (Narrator (voice))", "David Wilmot (Joseph Bell)", "Ciar\u00e1n McMenamin (Fred Barrett)", "Owen McDonnell (Trimmer Thomas Dillon)", "Hugh O'Conor (Assistant Engineer Jonathan Shepherd)", "Andrew Simpson (Electrician Albert Ervine)", "Jonathan Byrne (Electrician Alfred Middleton)", "Chris Newman (Assistant Electrician William Kelly)", "Douglas Rankine (Greaser Alfred White)", "Stephen Hogan (Thomas Andrews)", "Conor MacNeill (Frank Bell)", "Paul Kennedy (Assistant Engineer Herbert Harvey)", "Ciaran O'Grady (Leading Fireman)", "Owen Roe (White Star Lawyer)", "David Heap (White Star Official)", "Dermot Magennis (Tailor)", "Johnny Eveson (2nd Officer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
