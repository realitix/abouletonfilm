A bogatyr is an epic warrior from ancient Kievan Rus. Most are directed in the traditional bylinas, traditional Russian epic poems, as being endowed with enormous strength and cunning, although often not completely immune to human weaknesses. Here, our three heroes gather together once more to rescue the ruler of the land from the attempts of an evil foreign queen. She plans to make him fall in love with her so her youth and beauty can be renewed, but in exchange will destroy his kingdom.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sSQizNjb4DlMtMW0zdVojrpQq3j.jpg", "actors": ["Valeri Solovyev (Dobrynya (voice))", "Anna Geller (Queen (voice))", "Oleg Kulikovich (Alesha Popovich / Dragon (voice))", "Liya Medvedeva (Lyubava (voice))", "Sergei Makovetsky (Prince of Kiev (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [33534, 154922, 451172, 33065], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
