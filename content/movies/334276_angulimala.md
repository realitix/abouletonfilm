Despite his noble birth, his horoscope showed to be born under the sign of thieves, and thus was preordained for a wicked life. On his 16th birthday his father sent him to complete his education and Arhingsaka became the teacher's favorite; the other jealous students told the master that Arhingsaka was flirting with the teachers wife. Deciding to punish his former star pupil, he told Arhingsaka : \"You have almost completed your training; there is just one thing left to do. Once you finish your life of suffering will be over, and you will become a Bodhisattva. You must single-handedly kill 1,000 people\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/il0MZcDMogwGb970Ua1SUyRghvk.jpg", "actors": ["Nopachai Chaiyanam (Arhingsaka / Angulimala)", "Stella Malucchi (Nantha)", "John Rattanaveroj (Vikul)", "Kamron Gunatilaka (Sati)", "Alisa Kajornchaiyakul (Mantanee)", "Caterina Grosse ()", "Varin Sachdev ()", "Anant Sammarsup (Kakkapakawa)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "XkmIvD9Hl1M"}
