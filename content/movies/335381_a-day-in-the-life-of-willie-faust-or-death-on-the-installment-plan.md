Often out of focus with an overactive camera, the film immediately exudes nervous energy, but unlike Priest\u2019s elegant cocaine consumption in Super Fly, Willie\u2019s arm gushes blood as he injects heroin. A morality tale in two reels.  \u2014Jan-Christopher Horak", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/idOO5m9VikklrhZygaXScjKABRS.jpg", "actors": ["Jamaa Fanaka ()", "Carmen Gordon ()", "Boots ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
