These sweetly melancholic songs are what make Norah Jones's unique blend of country, folk, rock, soul and jazz so outstanding. She first shot to fame in 2002 with \u00abCome Away With Me\u00bb. This was followed by four more albums in which the New Yorker showcased her expanding repertoire. At the BALOISE SESSION, Norah Jones will be presenting a new album, \u00abDay Breaks\u00bb, in which she returns to her piano roots. The evening kicks off with young songwriter Damian Lynn from Lucerne (Switzerland), expertly accompanying himself with the aid of loop instruments.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lV7dyi14B30ZsTgZhhbJJ9b4tG6.jpg", "actors": ["Norah Jones ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
