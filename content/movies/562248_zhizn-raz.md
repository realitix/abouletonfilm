Resigned to the nostalgic impulse, she flies from Europe to Novustoinovsk - a district city in the middle of the country, which has long ceased to exist. There, in the provincial hinterland of the past, her memories and old friends live, all of them ephemeral as television programs from another life. This is a life story about fate of ordinary people, about quarrels, spiritual growth and decline, about hope and changeable memory.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lUdHXQvQ965za9NqlmJ4H2jXgu0.jpg", "actors": ["Ingeborga Dapk\u016bnait\u0117 (\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
