It was the first in a series of successful Lagerl\u00f6f adaptions by Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, made possible by a deal between Lagerl\u00f6f and A-B Svenska Biografteatern (later AB Svensk Filmindustri) to adapt at least one Lagerl\u00f6f novel each year. Lagerl\u00f6f had for many years denied any proposal to let her novels be adapted for film, but after seeing Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m's Terje Vigen she finally decided to give her allowance.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z11urU1BjpDgvXPr1sKHj05ll5C.jpg", "actors": ["Greta Almroth (Helga)", "Nils Ar\u00e9hn (Judge)", "Josua Bengtson (Constable)", "Georg Blomstedt (Hildur's Father)", "Thekla Borgh (Helga's Mother)", "G\u00f6sta Cederlund (Per M\u00e5nsson)", "Lars Hanson (Gudmund Erlandsson)", "William Larsson (Helga's Father)", "Karin Molander (Hildur)", "Edla Rothgardt (Per M\u00e5nsson's Wife)", "Concordia Selander (Gudmund's Mother)", "Hjalmar Selander (Gudmund's Father)", "Jenny Tschernichin-Larsson (Hildur's Mother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
