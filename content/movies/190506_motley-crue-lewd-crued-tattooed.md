Even without trouble-plagued drummer Tommy Lee (in his place, Hole's Samantha Maloney powerfully beats the skins), the Cr\u00fce sizzles through a 95-minute set of headbanging anthems like \"Kickstart My Heart,\" \"Dr. Feelgood,\" and \"Shout at the Devil.\" Even a raucous cover version of \"White Punk on Dope\" fits snugly into the Cr\u00fce's sound, with Vince Neil's vocals, Mick Mars's guitar, and Nikki Sixx's bass playing all in fine fettle.  Track Listing:  01. Kickstart My Heart,  02. Same Ol\u2019 Situation  03. Primal Scream  04. Punched in the Teeth By Love  05. Dr. Feelgood  06. Home Sweet Home  07.
