Rediscovered at the 1924 G\u00f6ttingen Handel Festival, the work soon became one of the composer's most popular operas, surpassed only by Giulio Cesare. Its popularity might in part be due to the incredibly popular aria it contains, Ombra mai fu.  Recordings of the complete opera are rare and this one first presented in Dresden combines a visually strong staging with exceptional cast and ensemble of Baroque specialists.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gpjNb0W32O9qLXXwUbDWNeM8EYp.jpg", "actors": ["Paula Rasmussen ()", "Ann Hallenberg ()", "Sandrine Piau ()", "Patricia Bardon ()", "Marcello Lippi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
