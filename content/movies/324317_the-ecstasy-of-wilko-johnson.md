It tells the extraordinary, yet universal story of legendary musician Wilko Johnson who, diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and given a few months to live, accepted his fate with uplifting positivity and embarked on a farewell tour, capturing the imagination of the world as he went. But like every good story Wilko's has a damn fine twist in its tail. Two years later and confounding the odds, Wilko wakes up in a hospital bed, unexpectedly sentenced to live, having now to integrate those enlightened lessons learnt under sentence of death into the unexpected and ongoing future of his life.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oAlYKhwAngpR8MFtxFaJch25Bu4.jpg", "actors": ["Wilko Johnson (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
