The Quartet as captured in this 1987 35th Anniversary concert consists of the following: John Lewis on piano, Milt Jackson on vibraphone, Percy Heath on bass, and Connie Kay on drums. Taped as a live performance at the Zelt-Musik-Festival in Freiburg, Germany, it's a great capture of seasoned musiciains.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dFB304HywEMltl44UslIfyYDngb.jpg", "actors": ["John Lewis (Himself)", "Milt Jackson (Himself)", "Percy Heat (Himself)", "Connie Kay (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
