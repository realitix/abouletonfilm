They were only trying to help when they answered the desperate calls of a stranger in need, but by the time they realized the trap had been set it was already too late. As the night goes on, the blood begins to flow, and a murderous ghost rises from the grave to deal out death to any living soul who dares to turn their heads and face that darkness that lurks in the shadows.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gQExDSHWmvYpAOhQYFUjh7FsQso.jpg", "actors": ["Travis Asbill ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
