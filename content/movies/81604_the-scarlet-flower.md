The eldest asks for a shining tiara, the middle asks for a frame through which her face would always appear young, and the youngest (Nastenka) asks her father to bring her a beautiful scarlet flower like one which she saw in her dreams. Her elder sisters laugh at this simple wish.  The father's trip is successful and he finds everything that he came for, with the exception of Nastenka's scarlet flower. Nevertheless, the ship heaves off and they begin to head back while the father scans the lands around him for a scarlet flower.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ja030oWJ0A7iTIBMiV4uSMYb3ON.jpg", "actors": ["Mariya Babanova (Lyubava (voice))", "Nikolai Bogolyubov (Stepan Emelyanovich (voice))", "Vladimir Gribkov (Kondrat (voice))", "Nina Krachkovskaya (Nastenka (voice))", "Olga Chepurova (Gordeya (voice))", "Aleksei Konsovsky (Beast / Prince (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [72212, 79853, 273961, 20899], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
