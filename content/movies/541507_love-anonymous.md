Emily believes it came from her head baker, a hot young man who mistakenly believes Emily wrote the poem to him! This leads to a whirlwind affair until she learns he had nothing to do with the poem at all... And now it's gone, stolen by a delivery boy out to impress the girl of his dreams. The poem makes the rounds and affects the love and sex lives of everyone in town: The Chief of Police, college students, a tenured professor and an art history major back home from studies abroad. It's a life-changer for some, an awakening for others, and an aphrodisiac for them all.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lC6qlYrY9Z2qRQMwQUoiDjU89N9.jpg", "actors": ["Julia Ann (Emily)", "Jade Nile (Jessica)", "Britney Amber (Shannon)", "Bianca Breeze (Prof. Lockwood)", "Charlotte Stokely (Emily's Sister)", "Tyler Nixon (Randy)", "Ryan McLane (Link)", "Van Wylde (Doug)", "Alex Chance (Prof. Lockwood's Student)", "Mo Reese (Prof. Lockwood's Student)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
