The 19th Century myth of Miasma, the bad air, related epidemic diseases with air, environment and race, which later helped to consolidate the vertical segregation on Hong Kong island. Acclimatization efforts were made in pace with expansion of the British Botanic Empire, a global network of scentific researches of plants, which circulated not only botanic specimens but also images created for the purpose of study. In the particular case of Canton in South China, local commercial artists were commissioned to make plant paintings. This work examines the peculiar dynamics between imperialism, scientific research, race and the right to look in 19th Century Canton.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hnnpL6qBhJPtGAAacOoURHZNcVZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
