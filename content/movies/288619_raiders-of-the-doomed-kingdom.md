Posing as Chinese Red Guard, they infiltrate a compound and regain the general only to be given chase. Racing to the shore, while picking up several female soldiers, they escape on a fishing boat with their pursuers in toe. The jungle island both parties reach happens to be a leper colony, and while the horribly disfigured inhabitants are friendly, they become pawns in the ensuing battle. Now the mercs must dig in for their lives against a Red Guard commander who just doesn't relent.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Sorapong Chatree ()", "Manny Aswatep ()", "Peter Ramwa ()", "Payak Ramnate ()", "Krao Spartacus ()", "Chaiyan Sorakrai ()", "Luck Apichart ()", "Somchin Theumatat ()", "Manop Aswathep ()", "Ratana Maongolan ()", "Peter Chumpon ()", "Surmian Suryoog ()", "Kavid Watanakul ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
