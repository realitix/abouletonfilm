The changes of the past half century have created a deep communications gap between generations and he is unable to communicate with his troubled son. Nor is the old man able to do much to help his grandson who is making his first forays into criminal life, blaming it all on his mother who admits she is incapable of loving him. The grandfather tires of life with the bleak family and so goes to an old folks home. But that proves repressive, so he and a couple of friends leave to enact a money-making scheme. When that fails, the old man finds himself alone and destitute on the rough streets of Sofia where his despairing eyes witness the further ruination of his homeland.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5Aa2Pxq3HWu8d2wLNw2txdLet7t.jpg", "actors": ["Itzhak Finzi (Staretza)", "Nikolai Urumov (Sinat Ivan)", "Virginija Kelmelyte (Snahata Tamara)", "Valeri Drennikov (Vnukat Emil)", "Vancha Doycheva (Meditzinskata sestra)", "Georgi Cherkelov (Priyatel)", "Georgi Rusev (Priyatel na Staretza)", "Sotir Maynolovski (Staretzat s nasledstvoto)", "Ivana Karayordanova (Zhana)", "Ivan Nestorov (Priyatelyat ot Amerika Moni)", "Anton Radichev (Priyatelyat na Ivan)", "Neli Topalova (Priyatelkata na Tamara)", "Velizar Binev (Psihologat)", "Stoyan Gudev (Zliyat)", "Elena Lafazanova ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
