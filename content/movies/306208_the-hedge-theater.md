It is an intimate film inspired by the Baroque architecture and stone carvings of Francesco Borromini and St. Martin and the Beggar, a painting by the Sienese painter Il Sassetta. Beavers\u2019 montage contrasts the sensuous softness of winter light with the lush green growth brought by spring rains. Each shot and each source of sound is steeped in meaning and placed within the film\u2019s structure with exacting skill to build a poetic relationship between image and sound.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6ctGEiplQgQA22mDZPwMVEpd6ef.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Beavers (Himself)", "Gregory J.
