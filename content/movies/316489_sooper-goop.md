(Not to mention a here-today, gone-tomorrow one; by the end, Sooper Goop is already being outsold by Eatum Sweetum, made from a different grain, but with the same drawbacks.) Kid-friendly, with a lesson easy to understand, and impossible to forget.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
