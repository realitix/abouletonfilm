Travelling more than 1,000 miles from the tip of the North Island down to the South, the actor finds out more about the place he has called home, visiting areas of natural beauty and learning about the nation's history and traditions. Along the way, he meets former All Blacks player Jonah Lomu, takes a trip around film star Sam Neill's vineyards in Queenstown, catches up with Jackson and goes Base-jumping from the tallest building in Auckland.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f8IqUNOD2VQVVRm6D5dsE5nKKNY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
