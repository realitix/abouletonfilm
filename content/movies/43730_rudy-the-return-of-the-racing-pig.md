Then Nickel goes on a school excursion and brings the little piglet Rudy back with him in his rucksack. Once he\u00b4s home, he makes a terrifying discovery: dad has a girlfriend! Worse yet, she\u00b4s moved in with him and brought her daughter Felicitas (12) along! Nickel makes a deal with Thomas: if those two stay, then so can Rudy.  When life becomes unbearable for Nickel, he flees with Rudy to \u2018Porkland\u2019, followed by Feli and pursued by two dumb crooks. It\u2019s the beginning of an adventure that ends in the swamps of the Oder Valley, where Rudi saves the lives of the two children and finds a new home.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kAKOJpHfF8BzcuZnMHywvneu2uo.jpg", "actors": ["Sebastian Koch (Thomas)", "Maurice Teichert (Nickel)", "Sophie von Kessel (Anja)", "Sina Richardt (Feli)", "Dominique Horwitz (Bomber)", "Ludger Burmann (Einsatzleiter)", "Maria Ehrich (Marie)", "Tom Hinterthan (Junge)", "Waldemar Kobus (Polizist)", "Sybille J.
