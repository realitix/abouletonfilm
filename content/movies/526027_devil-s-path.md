Two hikers have gone missing recently and with no leads or bodies and the area is now considered high risk and mostly closed off. The two strangers, Noah (Stephen Twardokus) and Patrick (JD Scalzo), are suddenly forced off the main trail after a confrontation with some suspicious hikers and soon find themselves running for their lives with nowhere to hide but in the trees.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sXCYlHeEM49Kd65RjzY4qBTTdpK.jpg", "actors": ["Stephen Twardokus (Noah)", "JD Scalzo (Patrick)", "Jon Gale (Gerry)", "Michael Hampton (Gerry)", "Steve Callahan (Park Ranger Tom)", "Spencer Kelly (Michael)", "Michael van Why (Stan)", "Brandy Elliott (Walkie Ranger (voice))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "r-0ykTzlqdo"}
