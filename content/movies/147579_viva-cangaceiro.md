The sadistic colonel Minas massacres the hometown of a famous cangaceiro (a kind of revolutionary bandit). The only survivor is a young farmer called Espedito; he is nursed back to health by a (crazy?) hermit who thinks he has been sent (= espedito) by God and therefore baptizes him the Redeemer. Espedito/The Redeemer forms his own gang of cangaceiros but doesn\u2019t really understand what he\u2019s doing until he befriends the proverbial European intellectual, a Dutch Oil prospector, who introduces him to important people. Espedito is hired (and of course double-crossed) by the Dutchman and a corrupt local governor, but then the Dutchman changes sides \u2026", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5OokggzhMoBejBskOdxAa1H2gCe.jpg", "actors": ["Tom\u00e1s Mili\u00e1n (Espedito/Miguein \"The Redeemer\")", "Ugo Pagliai (Vicenzo)", "Renato Rossini (Vincent Helfer/Hoffman)", "Eduardo Fajardo (Governor Branco)", "Howard Ross (Hoffmann)", "Leo Anch\u00f3riz (Colonel Minas)", "M\u00e1rio Gusm\u00e3o (Black Devil)", "Alfredo Santacruz ()", "Jes\u00fas Guzm\u00e1n ()", "Claudio Scarchilli ()", "Jos\u00e9 Carlos Farias ()", "Bernardete Dinor\u00e1 de Carvalho ()", "M. de Moura ()", "Irio Fantini ()", "Quinto Gambi (Pedro)", "Aldo Gasparri ()", "Bob Leo ()", "Goffredo Unger ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
