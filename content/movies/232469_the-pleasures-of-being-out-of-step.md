The film is about an idea as well as a man - the idea of free expression as the defining characteristic of the individual. Hentoff is a pioneering journalist who raised jazz as an art form and was present at the creation of 'alternative' journalism. 'Pleasures' wraps the themes of liberty and identity around a historical narrative that stretches from the Great Depression to the Patriot Act. With a mix of interviews, archival footage and music, it employs a complex non-linear structure to engage the audience in a life of independent ideas and the creation of an enduring voice.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gGKsM7bA3eHJUFlIiHTT6QGLveT.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
