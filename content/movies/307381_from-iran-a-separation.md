For the Iranian people this was more than a cinematic award. When sanctions and threats of war with Iran covered the world headlines, Farhadi talked about Iran's love for peace and the rich culture of the Iranians on the stage when receiving his award. This time the Iranians voice was heard through someone other than the government officials. This documentary shows the reaction of the Iranians to this Oscar award and has a general view on Iran's society of today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2IlLSazoPaowtGQdtakRCyYm7Ct.jpg", "actors": ["Payman Maadi (Nader)", "Shahab Hosseini (Hojjat)", "Leila Hatami (Simin)", "Sareh Bayat (Razieh)", "Sarina Farhadi (Termeh)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
