The pop-star get's hers when Rapeman shows her that she ain't always the boss. From there the story shifts gears when a Senator's secretary seeks out Rapeman's services to rape his fianc\u00e9 who has been brainwashed by a local cult.

This back-fires when the cult does not ex-communicate her - so Keisuke and Uncle infiltrate the cult to get to the bottom of their shady dealings.
