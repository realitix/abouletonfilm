There\u2019s lots of 60s French hipsters, strange devices, dancing and a disjointed soundtrack that alternates between pop music (like The Beatles and Screaming Lord Sutch) and harsh noise/tape manipulation which O\u2019Leary composed himself. It reminds me of the films of Gunvor Nelson, Jonas Mekas or even Frans Zwartjes. \u2014Herb Shellenberger", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8oRMPUQeEuykucQIxSQPIIeAuxs.jpg", "actors": ["Mich\u00e8le Giraud ()", "Marie-France Arsenault ()", "Leslie Kaye ()", "Denis O'Leary ()", "Jean-Pierre Scant ()", "\u00c9tienne O'Leary ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
