Broke, restless and horny, the thirty-two-year-old revolutionary is a frothing combination of intellectual brilliance, invective, satiric wit, and child-like emotional illiteracy.  Creditors, spies, rival revolutionary factions and prospective seducers of his beautiful wife all circle like vultures.

But there\u2019s still no one in the capital who can show you a better night on the piss than Karl Heinrich Marx.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4srPBRGW1OAUeLmAtXAF0VLECSN.jpg", "actors": ["Rory Kinnear (Marx)", "Nicholas Burns ()", "Oliver Chris (Engels)", "Nancy Carroll ()", "Laura Elphinstone ()", "Miltos Yerolemou ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
