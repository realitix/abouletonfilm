When war broke out Barry bade his sweetheart good-bye and went away to don the Union blue. Nell's brother fought for the South. The fortunes of war had brought a battle right to the doors of Nell, and two of the participants in that battle were Newton Barry and Tom Collings, the brother. Newton, wounded and separated from his comrades, took refuge in the home of his sweetheart. The Confederates tracked him there, led by Tom. Nell hid Newton in a secret closet, but was discovered by Tom. Seizing a musket from one of the troops, she held it at her brother's breast and there kept it until Newton was far away on his journey. When the war ended Tom was first to join in the glad welcome extended to Newton on his return to wed his sister.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
