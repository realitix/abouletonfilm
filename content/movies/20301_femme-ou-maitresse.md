This is a fine love triangle, and you root for Henry Fonda, even though every warm-blooded woman would pick Dana Andrews over him in a heartbeat. I found this in my 10-DVD Henry Fonda Collection, and it's a great set well worth purchasing. I'm not a huge fan of his work, but he's definitely done some great films and amassed a fine body of work. Preminger and Crawford are always solid for me, and they certainly don't disappoint in collaborating in this early work of his."}], "recommandations_id": [50271, 489998, 31148, 126748], "youtube_key": "Q3HsRE1H48I"}
