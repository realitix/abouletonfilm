The film's American title was Heaven Over the Marshes, and indeed most of the story is set in the disease-ridden Pontine Marshes on the outskirts of Rome. This was the home of Maria Goretti, a pious young girl who was murdered by her would-be seducer. For reasons elucidated in the course of the film, Maria's short time on earth made her worthy of Sainthood, which was actually bestowed upon her shortly after the release of this film. Maria Goretti is well-played by Ines Orsini. Cielo Sulla Palude served as the comeback feature for director Augusto Genina, whose previous pro-fascist films had caused him to be blacklisted after WW II.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oBbr4eiJBRr5dIdTeqzx5r2Tx1G.jpg", "actors": ["In\u00e9s Orsini (Maria Goretti)", "Giovanni Martella (Luigi Goretti - il padre di Maria)", "Mauro Matteucci (Alessandro Serenelli)", "Rubi D'Alma (La contessa Teneroni)", "Michele Malaspina (Il conte)", "Domenico Viglione Borghese (Il dottore (as D.
