Such is the case for the film's six heroes, as you can come in three parallel documents which are then woven into each other in a subtle and smooth way. We have Asai, dishwasher that suddenly may act Thai boxer to save the skin of his friend Ishii, who would have ordered an opponent of the evening fixing kickboxing match. We have two \"salarymen\" Ikeyama and Kishimoto, who by chance ends up at the restaurant where kickboxing match takes place. And last but not least we have the two amateur thieves Fujita and Kudoh, who are both indebted and somewhat desperate. All they will have to fly more or less for their lives from the restaurant and you suspect it will all end in disaster.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pI4I8YJr0Q8l7CMRJYkMyXnW4zG.jpg", "actors": ["Masayuki Sakamoto (Tadashi Ikeyama)", "Hiroshi Nagano (Kenta Kishimoto)", "Yoshihiko Inohara (Naoto Ishii)", "Go Morita (Kenji Fujita)", "Ken Miyake (Yuji Kudo)", "Junichi Okada (Takashi Akai)", "Sansei Shiomi ()", "Susumu Terajima ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
