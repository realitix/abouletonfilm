Kathy is a previously wealthy whose former football star husband has absconded with their funds and left her and their children to face his violent creditors. Pat needs money to get her drug-addicted son into an expensive rehabilitation center. Val struggles for options in her crisis: pregnancy, possibly by her white husband's black best friend. And Paula, Val's sister, needs the thrill of danger even more than money. Together they plot a robbery that leads them further into crime and possible disaster.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8zfgJ1vHDwjXu80dNCCl9yhXPpx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
