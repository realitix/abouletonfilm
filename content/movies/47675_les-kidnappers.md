His son's death has developed antagonism by MacKenzie toward all Dutchmen, which leads to Harry brawling at school with the son of a Dutchman. Harry falls down a cliff and is helped home by the community doctor, Willem Bloem, a Dutchman in love with MacKenzie's daughter, Kirsty. Due to the old man's feelings, they must carry on a clandestine romance. Forbidden by their grandfather to have a dog, Harry and Davy \"kidnap\" an unattended baby and care for the child in a lean-to shack. When found, the baby proves to be the child of MacKenzie's most-bitter Dutch enemy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uoiQhuY4qXjmbK3WToc9UvDzMeu.jpg", "actors": ["Jean Anderson (Grandma MacKenzie)", "Adrienne Corri (Kirsty)", "Theodore Bikel (Dr. Willem Bloem)", "Duncan Macrae (Jim MacKenzie)", "Vincent Winter (Davy)", "Jon Whiteley (Harry)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [131764, 110628, 42214, 99567], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
