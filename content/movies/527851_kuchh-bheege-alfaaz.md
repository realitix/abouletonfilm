Among his many fans is the boisterous Archana, a girl working at a creative agency \u2013 which designs branded memes. She is leukodermic but lives life to the fullest. They meet; or rather talk, for the first time over a misplaced call, when Archana accidentally dials Alfaaz's number, while trying to connect with her latest blind date. Thus begins an interesting relationship between two unlikely characters, one overly compensating, but in denial of her present, and the other buried under a dark secret of his past.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/25cv2bdc4IIIcMWdFiHC0uEy0eI.jpg", "actors": ["Zain Khan Durrani (Alfaaz)", "Geetanjali Thapa (Archana \"Archie\" Pradhan)", "Shray Rai Tiwari (Apu Khandelwal)", "Mona Ambegaonkar (Aruna Pradhan)", "Sourav Das (Tony Baby)", "Saheb Bhattacharjee (Partho)", "Debopriya (Naren)", "Sahil Agarwal (Kaushal)", "Barun Chanda (Mr. Sonkar)", "Chandrayee Ghosh (Priyanka)", "Shefali Chauhan (Chhavi)", "Soumya Brata Mukherjee (Param)", "Shankhu Karmakar (Lady Police)", "Udai Shankar (Chai Wala)", "Moumita (Receptionist)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "HY2T1MFhGAE"}
