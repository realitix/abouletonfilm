The work treats of the consciousness-defining echoing thunder of modern rock music, of the rock inscriptions of the ancient Egyptians, of the Merseburg magic spells, the author\u2019s childhood impressions, in the latter\u2019s homeland in the forests of the Upper Palatinate, and the ghosts of the Nazi era, who today continue to haunt us in the most vivid manner.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/g8O5yzl0kwqfnIqsM0JcveMlpJV.jpg", "actors": ["Maria Happel (voice)", "Corinna Harfouch (voice)", "Irm Hermann (voice)", "Ulrich Matthes (vocie)", "Angela Winkler (voice)", "Jens Harzer (voice)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
