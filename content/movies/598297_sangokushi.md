Central rule has disintegrated, and the land is controlled by multiple warlords. Wei is nominally ruled by the Han emperor, but power really belongs to his ambitious chancellor, Cao Cao Mengde. Wu, a state south of the Yangtze River, is ruled by Sun Quan Zhongmou. Liu Bei Xuande is a warrior from a small state. While Cao Cao is governed by ambition and Sun Quan by pride, Liu Bei aspires to build a just state and to serve the people.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/c9l50iBqlGGd2b4Uu3VE3KA2bJp.jpg", "actors": ["Kazuhiko Inoue (Liu Bei)", "Kei Tomiyama (Zhuge Liang)", "Atsushi Watanabe (Zhang Fei)", "Banjou Ginga (Xu Chu)", "Eiko Yamada (Yu Jin)", "Fumi Hirano (Sun Lihua)", "Jin Nakayama (Cao Cao)", "Kazuo Kumakura (Sima Hui)", "Masaru Ikeda (Sun Quan)", "Tamio Ohki (Jiang Gan)", "Tetsur\u00f4 Sagawa (Guan Yu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
