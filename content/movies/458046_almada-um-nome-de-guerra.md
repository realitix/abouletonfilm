He raised funds, filmed Almada, interviewed him and worked on this multimedia project for several years, even after the artist's death. The result was a complex artistic work, with three simultaneous projections of slides and film, music by Jorge Peixinho and the incorporation of other projects by Ernesto de Sousa. In a text titled \"Anticinema\" he would write: \"i do not make a movie / about almada / i make a movie with almada\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/12DKmCknMwdooEudPNIjBkbdPcf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
