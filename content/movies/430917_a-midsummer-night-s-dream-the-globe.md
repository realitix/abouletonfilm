The show is introduced by actress Meera Syal and is the first time any production has been live streamed from the Bankside venue.  Four runaway lovers find themselves smack bang in the middle of a dispute between the King and Queen of the fairies, and, as if that wasn\u2019t enough, a troupe of amateur actors are trying to rehearse a play. Between these unlikely groups flies Puck, armed only with a wicked sense of humour and a love potion capable of making anyone fall for the first person they set eyes upon. What could possibly go wrong?  Fusing music, dance and some serious comedy, Emma Rice\u2019s first production as Artistic Director brings the Dream crashing into the Globe\u2019s magical setting. Naughty, tender, transgressive and surprising, it promises to be a festival of theatre.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bScVuNIZeLTTa2qn128JpWswY6G.jpg", "actors": ["Ankur Bahl (Helenus)", "Edmund Derrington (Lysander)", "Ncuti Gatwa (Demetrius)", "Anjana Vasan (Hermia)", "Ewan Wardrop (Bottom)", "Meow Meow (Hippolyta / Titania)", "Zubin Varla (Theseus / Oberon)", "Katy Owen (Puck)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
