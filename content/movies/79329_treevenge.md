Clearly, for trees, Christmas isn\u2019t the exciting \u201cpeace on earth\u201d that is experienced by most. After being hacked down, and shipped away from their homes, they quickly become strung up, screwed into an upright position for all to see, exposed in a humiliation of garish decorations. But this Christmas will be different, this Christmas the trees have had enough, this Christmas the trees will fight back. Treevenge could be a short film about the end of days for Christmas trees, or perhaps, the end of humanity?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1BgmiuYRxhY9Yqs6cE6ZtxLNTMI.jpg", "actors": ["Jonathan Torrens (Jim Macmichael)", "Sarah Dunsworth (Cadence Macmichael)", "Maris Morgan (Krista Macmichael)", "Jayden Taylor (Jason Macmichael)", "Mike Cleven (Crew Boss)", "Jason Collins (Lumberjack #1)", "Timothy Dunn (Wreathmaker)", "Shaun Clark (Lumberjack #2)", "Aria Publicover (Joni Carpenter)", "Molly Dunsworth (Molly Carpenter)", "Rob Cotterill (Jon Carpenter)", "Craig Ferguson (Reporter)", "Glen Matthews (Yuppie Man)", "Kristin Slaney (Yuppie Woman)", "Keith White (Man With Shotgun)", "Sasha Snow (Screaming Woman)", "Sophie Snow (Crushed Baby)", "Cadence MacMichael (Girl In Hospital)", "David Brunt (Hobo With A Shotgun)", "Scott Horton (Telephone Pole Guy)", "John Dunsworth (Tree Voice)", "Cory Bowles (Tree Voice)", "Zoe Dunsworth (Voice of Trees)", "Alexander Rosborough (Lumberjack)", "Eric Duncan (Tree Rape Victim)", "Jason Eisener (Lumberjack / Tree Attack Victim)", "Sean Grady (Lumberjack)", "Karen Holmans (Lumberjack / Tree Attack Victim)", "Kyle Larkin (Lumberjack / Tree Attack Victim)", "Jason Shipley (Tree Attack Victim Tree Attack Victim)", "Joseph Mojo Widgery (Lumberjack / Tree Attack Victim)", "Lex Gigeroff (Tree Lot Boss)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [222575, 94265, 95381, 136681], "youtube_key": "sLawcjYiBs8"}
