Ion (Dan Nutu) seeks to find out why many years ago his father was falsely accused of being a communist, an accusation which led to his execution. He discovers that his father's mistress, now married to a wealthy man, made the accusation for money, as she was deathly afraid of poverty. Ion's own girlfriend seems to be similarly concerned about issues of livelihood, and abandons him for a richer suitor. Frustrated and angry, he burns down these couple's houses and takes up with some anti-communist arms smugglers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qYa2BVpaK925K37nIP9RNeKVMEO.jpg", "actors": ["Dan Nu\u021bu (Niculai / Ion Mohreanu)", "George Constantin (Nae Caramet)", "Mircea Albulescu (Che Andrei)", "Emil Botta (Printul Ipsilanti)", "Gina Patrichi (Vetina)", "Violeta Andrei (Bisca)", "Vasile Nitulescu (Pavel Berechet)", "Gheorghe Dinic\u0103 (maiorul Ionescu)", "Ernest Maftei (Titi Sorici)", "Constantin Rautchi (Petrea Duna)", "\u0218tefan Mih\u0103ilescu-Br\u0103ila (Gheorghe Jinga)", "Ileana Buhaci-Gurgulescu ()", "Andrei Codarcea ()", "Horia Georgescu ()", "Ion Henter (Vechilul de pe mosia printului)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
