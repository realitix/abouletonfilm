Perception journeys through the same season of time from each character's point of view, detailing how presumption and mistaken intention leads to great misunderstanding. A moment, revisited from another point of view, takes new dimension--and the line between protagonist and antagonist blurs.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rIV6uCTpjLzNlUORydA5suFrckU.jpg", "actors": ["Clay Adams (Ralph)", "Ryan P.
