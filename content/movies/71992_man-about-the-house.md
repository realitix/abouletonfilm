When a development company tries to buy all the houses in their street, flatmates Robin, Chrissy and Jo decide to help their landlords in staving off the buy out.\r\n\r\nThe material here is sadly too thin that it wastes what was always a damn fine cast. The sexy spark between Robin and the two girls is still there, and Mildred\u2019s (Joyce) sexual frustration with hubby George (Murphy) continues; with an interesting twist added a film\u2019s culmination, yet it\u2019s all very tired and short on laughs. You know you are trouble when you have to resort to a gastric stomach problem to hang your big laugh sequence on. Still, the cast are always watchable (I have been in love and lust with Wilcox since forever), while small appearances by Arthur Lowe and Spike Milligan are most welcome diversions from the poor screenplay. 5/10"}], "recommandations_id": [249327, 117609, 80534, 145826]}
