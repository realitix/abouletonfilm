The most popular of all is The Great Bazandini. Villagers clamor to see his act, but one person knows it\u2019s a sham...his daughter, Mirza. She desperately wants to escape this world of swindlers, but standing in her way is the carnival\u2019s ringleader, notorious conman, Dr. Leopold Rundy.  MIRZA THE MIRACULOUS is a short lo-fi sci-fi experimental B-movie adventure incorporating dubbed gibberish voices, abstract art, remnants of Mardi Gras costumes, toy props, dustbuster spaceships, on-screen text and analog electronic music. It\u2019s absurd, kaleidoscopic and homemade.  The movie was originally shot on an abandoned Western movie set on the Texas-Mexican border in 1999, but was abandoned due to technical difficulties. 15 years later, the project was revived by a successful Kickstarter fund-raising campaign. The original footage was reimagined and re-edited with new technology to create a one-of-a-kind film.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Paul Soileau (Dr. Leopold Rundy)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
