It perfectly captures the glittering never-land of rococco Vienna the way the Viennese\u2014and the rest of the world\u2014wish it had been, and it\u2019s the ideal setting for an adult comedy of love and errors. Susan Graham is the aristocratic young Octavian, torn between two women: Ren\u00e9e Fleming as the Marschallin, the mature woman who understands that one day Octavian must leave her; and Christine Sch\u00e4fer as Sophie, the young girl who unexpectedly captures his heart. Kristinn Sigmundsson is the lecherous Baron Ochs who sets the whirling plot in motion, and Edo de Waart conducts.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4kTUTrhP2PypobFSvOcJg5WTxal.jpg", "actors": ["Ren\u00e9e Fleming ()", "Christine Sch\u00e4fer ()", "Thomas Allen ()", "Kristinn Sigmundsson ()", "Susan Graham ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
