This controversial 20th century painter defied the world avant-garde of his time: \u201cI don\u2019t follow schools. I am an impressionist, cubist, futurist, abstractionist. A melting pot. The real tradition is not to try and relive the past \u2013 which is impossible to achieve \u2013 but rather something that sets up a follow-through, as happens with parents and children. A child and his father are never alike.\u201d The film follows Amadeo\u2019s motto. It crosses pictorial fiction \u2013 suggested by the emblematic picture \u201cThe Procession\u201d, painted in Paris in 1913 \u2013 with Portuguese contemporary reality.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
