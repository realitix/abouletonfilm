This film, narrated by George Manuel, president of the National Indian Brotherhood, presents the view of spokesmen for Canadian Indian and M\u00e9tis groups. There is a sharp contrast between the official celebrations, with Queen Elizabeth II among the guests, and what Indians have to say about their lot in the Company's operations.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tqnK4Y8OyShQUBlcoivE2aEMH8S.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
