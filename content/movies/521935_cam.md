It\u2019s brought to us by Blumhouse Productions. Cam is the story of Alice, an online cam girl, who live-streams from her home studio. Just when things are looking good, her account is hijacked by her doppelganger. While the film is pretty interesting to start with, it loses some steam in the middle and leaves the audience with a whole bunch of unanswered questions, especially around the characters in the movie. It's a good one time watch that feels like a longish Black Mirror episode."}], "recommandations_id": [405774, 424121, 481375, 493922], "youtube_key": "pN8xZ5WDonk"}
