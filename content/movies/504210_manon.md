Manon\u2019s story\u2014from innocent country girl to celebrated courtesan to destitute prisoner\u2014is one of the great tragic tales in literature and music, and this performance brings out all of its colors, as seen through Massenet\u2019s masterful score, from the comedic beginning to the heart-wrenching finale. Piotr Bezcala is des Grieux, Manon\u2019s lover, who decides to become a priest when she leaves him, but ultimately is reunited with her, only to lose her again. Paulo Szot sings Lescaut, and Fabio Luisi conducts the Met Orchestra and Chorus.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8x1gXITbDW1knVcPquygnmChGKd.jpg", "actors": ["Paulo Szot (Lescaut)", "Anna Netrebko (Manon)", "David Pittsinger (Count Des Grieux)", "Piotr Beczala (Des Grieux)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
