So we don;t get her side of the situation.\r\n\r\nWhat we do get is Dutch vocal virtuoso Floor Jansen coming in and completely blowing away all prevous Nightwish vocalists. The title refers to the alleged amount of time Jansen had to learn so many Nightwish songs.\r\n\r\nHer climactic rendition of 'Ghost Love Score' will raise the hairs on the arms of anybody watching, and leave you with no doubt as to who the true singer for Nightwish should be."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
