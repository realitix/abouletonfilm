In the village, however, Anna has been hostile for quite some time. The reason: It defies the plans of the municipal council to open up the region for mass tourism. In the charming Johannes Wallner Anna first thinks she has found an ally - until she discovers that he is actually working for the unscrupulous tourist group. Only through the love of Anna does Johannes begin to question the plans of his clients.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/z3BM2AEOJhl3jtrV2GrpdEiwyYk.jpg", "actors": ["Christine Neubauer (Anna Christeiner)", "Sascha Hehn (Johannes Wallner)", "Veronika Fitz (Zensi Christeiner)", "Timothy Peach (Markus Wallner)", "Ronja Forcher (Elise Christeiner)", "Alexander Held (Stadlhuber)", "Franz Froschauer (Penzinger)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
