Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack\u2019s 1933 classic, King Kong. Zulueta re-filmed a television broadcast of the original, and through creative subtraction and manipulation of camera speed, condensed the original\u2019s feature length to an intensified seven minutes. The cathode-ray flicker and flattening that results from the re-filming defamiliarises the original, but its classical continuity mode of address continues to operate on the viewer, and the increase in velocity makes mesmerisingly urgent the dramatic plot of the original. \u2014Senses of Cinema", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uiePDaQVqLigKJzAUBGZKSF5kTO.jpg", "actors": ["King Kong (King Kong)", "Fay Wray (Ann Darrow)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
