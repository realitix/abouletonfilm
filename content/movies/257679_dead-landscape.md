As the countryside grows ever more deserted because people are moving to towns or large collective farms, she spends more and more time alone. Despite her best efforts to appreciate her situation, her despair grows. The loneliness is briefly interrupted when she and her husband take in an old woman and care for her, but the woman dies. Shortly after her son visits, she is killed in an accident which may have been a suicide. ~ Clarke Fountain, Rovi", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mTahEz9bb647F48YnFC46RkjKHj.jpg", "actors": ["T\u00f6r\u0151csik Mari (Juli, K\u00e1ntor feles\u00e9ge)", "Istv\u00e1n Ferenczi (Anti K\u00e1ntor)", "Irma Patk\u00f3s (Erzsi n\u00e9ni)", "Irma Patk\u00f3s (Andris, Juli\u00e9k fia)", "J\u00f3zsef Papp (Tan\u00e1r)", "Istv\u00e1n Szil\u00e1gyi ()", "Andr\u00e1s Ambrus (Borda S\u00e1ndor)", "Koltai J\u00e1nos (Priest)", "J\u00e1nos P\u00e1kozdi (Varga Pista)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
