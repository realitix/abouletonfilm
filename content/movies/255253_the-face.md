He heads towards a site where there used to be a house or small village. Now there is nothing. Slight signs of something old and lost: the place where he was born. His presence allows the things in the abandoned spot to materialize: huts and tables, animals and canoes. Soon others arrive on the island: his wife, father, friends, and children. This is a meeting of the Man and his loved ones. With the dead, the birds, the river's music and his pain.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jB4xEBEQisGit4zmueQlEKVBTjU.jpg", "actors": ["Gustavo Hennekens ()", "Mar\u00eda Del Huerto Ghiggi ()", "Pedro Gabas ()", "Hector Maldonado ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
