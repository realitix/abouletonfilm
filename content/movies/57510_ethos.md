With interviews from some of todays leading thinkers and source material from the finest documentary film makers of our times Ethos examines and unravels these complex relationships, and offers a solution, a simple but powerful way for you to change this system!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9dlIL6qDl11aT1lfE4Ee9Gjfa91.jpg", "actors": ["Woody Harrelson (Host)", "Noam Chomsky (Himself)", "Howard Zinn (Himself)", "Richard Pearl (Himself)", "Chalmers Johnson (Himself)", "Charles Lewis (Himself)", "Cynthia McKenny (Herself)", "Bill  Hogan (Himself)", "Tony Benn (Himself)", "Michael Moore (Himself)", "Solomon Epstein (Himself)", "Sigmund Freud ()", "Edward Said ()", "Bernie Sanders ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [147747, 34369], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
