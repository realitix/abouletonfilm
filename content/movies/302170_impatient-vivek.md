He takes money without permission and travels to Goa along with his friends. Once there, he meets and falls in love with Shruti Tyagi - but she rejects him. Two years later, the duo meet again, and he finds out that her father, B.K. Tyagi, is Rameshwar's doctor, and builds up enough courage to seek his permission to marry Shruti - but is told that she is soon to marry U.S.-based Raj. Unable to handle this, and hoping that Shruti will change her mind, he fools his family into believing that she also loves him, and abducts her. Watch what impact this kidnapping has on Raj, the entire Tyagi family, as well as on Rameshwar and the rest of the family - especially when they find out that Vivek has been lying to them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/h7RdvMmZklRFMW4s34mslEK2guL.jpg", "actors": ["Vivek Sudershan (Vivek 'iV')", "Sayali Bhagat (Shruti B.
