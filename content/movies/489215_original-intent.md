Unfortunately, influences, such as Cultural Marxism and Corporate Fascism, have perverted the Democratic and Republican parties so much, the Founders' original intent has been seriously compromised. As a result, the republic guaranteed by the Constitution has wandered down a road towards insolvency, immorality and totalitarianism. ORIGINAL INTEN explores how this has happened and offers solutions that Americans, no matter what party affiliation, can apply to restore a nation of values, general welfare, and leadership-by-example.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
