Temptation and lust have become primary themes associated with the archetypal female. 'Dame Factory' is a short experimental film being produced by a 99% female cast and crew. It's a stylish yet grotesque, cynical yet sexy look at how our culture commodifies and objectifies female bodies and how we distort and merge concepts of womanhood and sex. Through a combination of beautiful cinematography, colorful set pieces, hypnotic performances and visually arresting special effects, 'Dame Factory' will shock, titillate and push the limits of how we talk about lust in a post-feminist era where releasing a sex-tape is now passe and pole dancing has become simply another form of gym-sanctioned exercise.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hvdeb10GEm9Xz5779a2GHydZtpH.jpg", "actors": ["Heather Andersen (Ice Cream)", "Nicole Haddad (Cold Cut)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
