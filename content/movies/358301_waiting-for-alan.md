Trapped in the rich but sterile environment of a lavishly appointed country house, MARCIA is a microcosm of society \u2013 a victim of, and partner in, someone else's routine. It\u2019s not the housework or the cooking (MRS BETTS looks after those), but the daily monotony of waiting for ALAN \u2013 her newspaper-reading, TV watching husband. To him, she's just the emotional central heating switched on and off in return for paying the bills and expected to operate as smoothly and regularly as the washing-up machine or the gardener. But MARCIA has waited long enough\u2026 WAITING FOR ALAN is a humorous but critical 'tale of the unexpected' (and expected) in classical, three-movement sonata form. It was screened at least twice on Channel Four television in the late eighties and both times received a very positive audience response as well as praise from weekly pre-viewers in the newspapers", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sBHxFMSbY4Q8UQOk5pj4eoeYiFN.jpg", "actors": ["Anthony Schaeffer (Alan)", "Joyce Kennedy (Mrs Betts)", "Carolyn Pickles (Marcia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
