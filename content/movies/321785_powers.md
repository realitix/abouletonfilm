He\u2019s a popular magician in a posh Prague nightclub, whose act draws more applause than the strippers. He\u2019s got an eye-catching assistant who is ready and willing to cuddle his frayed nerves whenever necessary. But he\u2019s also got Sylvia on his neck: a pert, scatterbrained sister who forgets that a toss in the hay may just be worth a wedding ring. Things take a turn for the better \u2013 or worse? \u2013 when he discovers he possesses extra - let\u2019s say, supernatural \u2013 powers that enable him to see into the future, hear music by rubbing his finger over a CD, and God knows what. The problem? Peter can\u2019t control anything any more like he used to \u2013 neither his magic act, nor his love life, nor his sister\u2019s latest erotic fantasy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yboSwm4w6rPA81MF8RHN7CiLTHg.jpg", "actors": ["Ivan Trojan (Petr V\u00e1lek)", "Zuzana \u0160ulajov\u00e1 (Svatava)", "Nela Boudov\u00e1 ()", "Tom\u00e1\u0161 Pavelka ()", "Pavel K\u0159\u00ed\u017e ()", "Ivana Ch\u00fdlkov\u00e1 ()", "Petr Forman ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
