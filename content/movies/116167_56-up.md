While the upper class children were confident and self-assured, those from middle and working class backgrounds were resigned to a challenging life of hard work. This premise was put to the test every seven years when the same group were interviewed about the progression of their lives. 49 years in the making, the changes that occurred to the original 14 make for fascinating television and are in many ways the stories of all our lives. From success and disappointment, marriage and childbirth, to poverty and illness, nearly every facet of life has been captured on film. Now, at the age of 56, the group are once more brought together and, with the benefit of hindsight, assess whether their lives have been ruled by circumstance or self-determination.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/32tZc2nndes6xKDHR7sBibIEzZ7.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [20562, 13365, 20565, 20561], "youtube_key": "f-U6RfKVzCs"}
