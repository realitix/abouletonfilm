What type of footage did they return with from this expedition? How about Marla Streb trekking through a remote jungle in Thailand. Try grinding up the Sawtooth Mountains in Idaho with Killen and Randolph. Or John Kirkaldie and Nathan Rankin tearing up a DH course at Mach 1 in New Zealand. Or perhaps your fancy is tickled by watching Brian Lopes float 60-foot moto-style jumps at a secret Nor Cal location. Not to be outdone by the American- Chris Kovarik and Michael Ronning launch it over a moving train on location in Cairns, Australia. What ever your style of riding- this video will definitely have you hitting your rewind button.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/foBc5CGXG0EA08mfze48cr05alM.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
