Arguably one of his best works, King Hu\u2019s short Anger is an adaptation of the famous Peking opera San Cha Kou; set to opera instrumentation and stylishly shot, the film deftly captures the tense showdown between political schemers, avengers and vagabonds inside an inn. Li Han-hsiang\u2019s Happiness, inspired by the Strange Tales of Liaozhai, tells a tale of reprieve for a kind-hearted ghost, while Pai Ching-Jui\u2019s Joy and Lee Hsing\u2019s Sadness both explore the fateful encounters between mortal men and ghostly women.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/96hPrj8GudZVnPzfPKULR8Avppf.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
