They end up at the Lazy S ranch and get work despite the fact that they clearly have no idea what they are letting themselves into.\r\n\r\nThat's as much as you need to know really, there is the usual mix up of songs, love interest, and pure mania that goes with the decent films from the boys considerably large CV. A running plot strand of the guys on the run from Indian's because Lou has accidentally got engaged to a squaw, makes for some great and humorous scenes, but the stand out sequence takes place at a swimming pool, wonderfully funny part of the film. The film isn't really one to win new fans to the comedic talent of the pair because the running time could be too long for some with this brand of humour, but for those already converted, the film sits nicely up at the top with the best of their work.\r\n\r\nA-ticket, a-tasket, a green and yellow basket! 7/10"}], "recommandations_id": [33486, 33484, 31523, 33479], "youtube_key": "5YOlbsD4XA8"}
