It is a modernist (and very Soviet) look at a young girl\u2019s interaction with the world around her and displays many of the strengths of the director\u2019s later work, including his attention to milieu and his sensitivity to young performers. -http://www.vulture.com/2009/07/in_soviet_russia_nikita_mikhal.html", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
