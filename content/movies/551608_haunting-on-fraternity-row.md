But _Haunting on Fraternity Row_ spends a lot of time developing its characters, which I appreciate, and even it's MacGuffin-y Horror Hole was pretty intriguing.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"}], "recommandations_id": [456950], "youtube_key": "sRz0LkBxClI"}
