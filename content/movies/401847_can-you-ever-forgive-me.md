Actually after basically every single thing I've seen her in up until this point. I honestly can't think of a single role I've liked her in. Until Lee Israel of course, because as her, in this, McCarthy is great.\r\n\r\nRespect for Richard E. Grant in the supporting role as well.\r\n\r\nIt took me a little while after I'd finished watching _Can You Ever Forgive Me?_ to realise I liked it as much as I did, but I did.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"}], "recommandations_id": [340613, 465914, 375262, 458737], "youtube_key": "UvJIaNsf_bY"}
