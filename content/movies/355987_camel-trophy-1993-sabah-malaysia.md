Equipped with identically prepared Land Rover Discoverys, the teams circumnavigated Sabah. Leeches fell... and bit. Torrential storms washed away roads and bridges. Fatigue sapped every last drop of energy. The participants, displaying a rare team spirit, deserved their awards and congratulations. They had not only overcome every threatening obstacle thrown their way, but had also left behind a valuable and lasting scientific reminder of their efforts in the shape of an ecological field station in the Maliau Basin.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lINb3WJCoLc0MqaCcJ1sJZQpkS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
