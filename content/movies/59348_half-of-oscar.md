Oscar lives in a barren section of Almeria, Spain, where he works as a guard at a salt mine. Oscar's days are governed by a monotonous routine: he goes to work, has lunch with fellow guard Miguel, finishes work, visits his dying grandfather at a hospice, and then goes home. While he sometimes spends his evenings with a woman, it's clear their relationship is not a close one. One day, Oscar gets word that grandfather has been transferred to a hospital, and his sister Maria, who now lives in Paris, comes to Almeria to pay the old man a visit. Maria, who is expecting a baby, is accompanied by her boyfriend Jean , who tries to keep a distance between the two siblings. It becomes clear that Oscar and Maria share an ugly secret that she wants to keep hidden at all costs, leading to an grim tension that grows between her and her brother.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bCIxAP7Nh2Bz8iFek48zp7kQYcg.jpg", "actors": ["Eva Almaya (Directora residencia)", "Antonio de la Torre (Taxista)", "Dennis Deyri (Jean)", "Ver\u00f3nica Echegui (Mar\u00eda)", "Manuel Mart\u00ednez Roca (Manuel)", "Rodrigo S\u00e1enz de Heredia (\u00d3scar)", "Elena Saganovska (Elena)", "Alejandro Vera (Recepcionista)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
