This documentary details the root causes of the systemic value disorders and detrimental symptoms caused by our current established system.  The film advocates a new socio-economic system, which is updated to present-day knowledge, featuring the life-long work of Social Engineer, Futurist, Inventor and Industrial Designer Jacques Fresco, which he calls a Resource-Based Economy.  Paradise or Oblivion by the Venus Project introduces the viewer to a more appropriate value system that would be required to enable this caring and holistic approach to hhuman civilisation.  This alternative surpasses the need for a monetary-based, controlled scarcity environment we find ourselves in today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nvNZdvz9JUGaE5TV4PchQznvGS4.jpg", "actors": ["Jacque Fresco (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [35567], "youtube_key": "Ip_ElRKNTUQ"}
