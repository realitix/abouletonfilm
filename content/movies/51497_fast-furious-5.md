I haven't even seen parts 1 and 2. I've seen part 3 (Tokyo Drift) which I think was a waste of time. I've seen part 4 just because everyone's watching it and surprisingly I liked it. I was even surprised to find out that Bryan O'Conner (Paul Walker) was a policeman. Haha!\r\n\r\nSo here I am, watching the fifth installment. Justine wanted to watch it badly and since I have nothing to do, I decided to accompany her. She was on leave the whole week and she just got back from Palawan. So before watching the movie, the 2 of us had dinner at Jack's Loft. I told her that we should buy tickets first but because we were lazy we forgot about it. When it was an hour before the movie, we were surprised. Sold out. Well, nearly sold out. There were like less than 10 seats. So we still went in line and luckily got seats even if the seats were bad and we were seated separately from each other. \r\n\r\nI liked this movie. Although it was very unrealistic. (Hello? Where's the government of Rio?) I like how The Rock was there. I like him. I don't like Vin Diesl. I don't understand a word coming out of his mouth. Jordana was still pretty but she's not as pretty in this film. She's too thin. But all in all I liked it."}], "recommandations_id": [13804, 9615, 584, 82992]}
