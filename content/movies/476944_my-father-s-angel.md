Everything changes when he hits recent Bosnian Muslim refugee Ahmed (Tony Nardi). Whereas Djordje and his family have had a relatively easy time adjusting to their new culture, Ahmed and his clan have had to struggle. He has a hard time with the language and his wife Sayma (Asja Pavlovic) is still traumatized by repeated rapes and abuse at the hands of Serb troops. Djordje's attempts at making amends are inevitably interpreted as acts of aggression, and soon the two families are forced to either be drawn into an ugly cycle of hatred or to learn from one another.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vfuMuhkqGyH2i2K2BLL9zWnbJTW.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
