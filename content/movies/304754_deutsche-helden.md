He protects Germany\u2019s secrets but when his wife lets them slip, he abandons her and decides to continue to protect his country but this time on the battlefield. He is depicted as a hero battling enemy troops, but also demonstrates kindness and benevolence when he listens to the story of two prisoners. His benevolence is rewarded, as the prisoners turn out to be his wife and his son, whom he has never met. His newfound son decides to join him in battle but is killed fighting, and at the end of the film only Wendhorst comes home to his wife. Wendhorst and his son depict ideal German soldiers whose belief in the glory and good of their country never falters, even to the very end.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tORMiKzfDMYJDAOzYDeK5MQHEmP.jpg", "actors": ["Mia Cordes ()", "Rudolf Del Zopp ()", "Max Laurence ()", "Dorrit Weixler ()", "Carl Zickner ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
