I'm not even saying that to be rude, I mean they literally aren't professional actors, as in, they have jobs and those jobs lie outside of the realm of acting. It was quite the experience to sit down to watch my dodgy horror movie for the night and realise \"Oh damn, that's classic schmoe Tiffany Smith!\" and so on. Even with that aside, _House of Demons_ was not the typical dodgy horror I was expecting. It's actually got a fair bit of originality, and is really more of a psychedelic moral exploration than the straight up cabin in the woods/haunted house movie I thought I was in store for. I mean, none of these things make _House of Demons_ **good**, but still, well worth noting.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"}], "recommandations_id": []}
