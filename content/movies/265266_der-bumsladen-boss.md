Comedy is still here. What's it about?  Melanie, a nineteen year old girl, is starting to attend a noble Hostess school. Or at least, that's what she believes. But the truth is, she ends up with other girls in a nightclub and works as a prostitute. Not a hostess. :lol:\r When her father finds out, him and her two brothers are trying to get her out of there.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1DvPqYb0THVYI4URihsTuf7AgB4.jpg", "actors": ["Dorothea Rau (Linda)", "Natasha Michnowa (Melanie)", "Britt Corvin (Bumsladenm\u00e4dchen)", "Flavia Keyt (Inderin)", "Marguerite H.
