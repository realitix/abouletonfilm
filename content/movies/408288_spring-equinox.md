Like most of Benning's films, Spring Equinox is at once direct and mystical. Simple images and landscapes become charged with meaning. As the film develops, changes in altitude and time give way to subtle shifts in light and texture; the result is as thrilling as it is breathtakingly beautiful.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rqxw5IGoZvTucrbTB7W9yk8J0fk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
