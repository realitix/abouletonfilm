It turns out that this research involves investigating the sex lives of her hosts and their friends. Disappointed with what she discovers, she takes a hand to improve them, taking the husband to visit prostitutes (one of these is Samantha) and making a loan of her boyfriend to the wife. Her 'students' get very enthusiastic - the husband has sex with his secretary (Gwenda Farnel) and the wife seduces her husband's employee. It ends with a wife-swapping foursome with Richard Lemieuvre and Jenny Feeling whose offer of such a party had been turned down at the start of the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uOvhZtAWiCKxJVZqrF5YoH7w4Mo.jpg", "actors": ["Dani\u00e8le Troeger (Marie-Ange)", "Gwenda Farnel (Linda, Jean-Louis Vattier's secretary)", "Nadine Scant (Isabelle)", "Samantha ()", "Jean-Louis Vattier (Laurent, the husband, an inadequate lover)", "Richard Allan (Anne's husband (a swinging couple) and a friend of Laurent and his wife)", "Thierry de Brem (Thierry, a student friend of Marie-Ange)", "Alban Ceray (Brunetti, an employee of Laurent)", "Agn\u00e8s Lemercier (Anne)", "Nadine Pascal ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
