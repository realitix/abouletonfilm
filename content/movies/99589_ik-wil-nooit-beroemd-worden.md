Following heart failure in 1997, his life took a dramatic turn. He was pronounced clinically dead and brought back to life with jolts of electricity. He was in a coma for several weeks and, when he woke up, he turned out to be physically and mentally handicapped. In this way, at the age of 39, Tobias found himself in a wheelchair and was no longer able to talk as a result of his brain damage. From that moment on, playing the cello was a thing of the past.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ouLdekAQXBDnhIwhxx4kHYBz8Qb.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
