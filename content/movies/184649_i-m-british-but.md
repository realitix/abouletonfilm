The rhythms of Bhangra and Bangla music set the pace for this lively collage of interviews with British Asian youth. Mixing archival footage with present day street scenes of Asians in England, this film chronicles the role of race and cultural identity in the formation of modern day British society. I'm British but... is an engaging critique of nationalisms of any sort and a celebration of cultural diversity and hybridity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nJjsohT2U7Ec4zIRDsgPf6jT1NC.jpg", "actors": ["Neetinder Boparai ()", "Apala Chowdhury ()", "Michael Khan ()", "Jabeen Mohammed ()", "Ramesh Rana ()", "San-j Sanj (himself)", "Haroon Shamsher (himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
