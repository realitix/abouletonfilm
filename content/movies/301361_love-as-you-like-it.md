The film, which features an unique overall vision incorporating both super 8mm film and digital video, follows a group of dynamic characters as they struggle with what it means to love, and to be loved. Unapologetic and unforgettably wild in its approach to combining Shakespeare and cinema, LOVE: AS YOU LIKE IT is simply not to be missed. This is not Shakespeare at its finest; this is Shakespeare the way its meant to be - bold, brave and brassy.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j6gF2h7hqxtWKxfZBH5iEczSJNP.jpg", "actors": ["Angela Gulner (Rosalind)", "Sullivan Jones (Orlando)", "Lenne Klingaman (Celia)", "Keith Barletta (Touchstone)", "Arielle Brachfeld (Audrey)", "Alan Kaiser (Silvius)", "Veronica Mannion (Phebe)", "Anna Ross (Cafe Patron)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
