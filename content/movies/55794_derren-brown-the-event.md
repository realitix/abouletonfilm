Filmed in front of a live studio audience, this series is made up of four one-hour specials, during which Brown attempts what he has described as \"some of the most incredible feats to date\". The show consists of a mixture of pre-recorded location pieces connected by theatre-based segments, with each of the four programmes building up to a major stunt performance. The first trailer broadcast included Brown speaking in reverse but walking forwards with events around him happening forwards. Seemingly cryptic messages were also hidden in the advert such as links to a \"Manchester United\" website. The advert was later played forwards (although now with Brown moving in reverse), and revealed the premise of the shows. Brown explains that in his new series he will be revealing the \"inner workings\" of his tricks and \"showing you how to get away with it\".", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
