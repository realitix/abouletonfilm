They seduce everyone in sight - the maid, the owner/chef (Alban Ceray), a lone female guest (XNK2367), a guest couple (Charlie Schreiner and Myriam Watteau), but not (yet) the baker\u2019s boy, and turn them all into sex maniacs, including the frustrated baker\u2019s boy. This 'lad' (Vattier is a bit old for the part) spies an orgy going on inside the hotel and is driven to draw a female outline in the gravel of the drive and then make love to it. The hole he creates eventually becomes a fertility symbol site of scientific interest, attracting a couple of researchers to investigate it (Nadine Scant and a Charlie Schreiner near look-alike).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/u3PSiK7cxgKwn8SXh5CnBgBx43o.jpg", "actors": ["Barbara Moose ()", "Myriam Watteau (hotel guest)", "Carole Gire ()", "Alban Ceray (Alban)", "Dominique Aveline (the motorist (uncredited))", "Roger Trapp (the man who plays a gendarme)", "Jean-Louis Vattier (Gaston, the baker's boy)", "Fiorentina Fuga (the maid)", "Nadine Scant (one of the researchers (uncredited))", "Charlie Schreiner (a guest)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
