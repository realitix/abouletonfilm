The film charts two journeys, from rural South Africa under apartheid and the rolling hills of Southern California, to the starting line of the women\u2019s 3,000 metres. It uncovers a tale of betrayal and exploitation, of the blurred lines between politics, media and sport, and of the dedication and sacrifice required to compete at the highest level. It\u2019s a story that split governments and divided nations, but at its heart is a tale of two young women who, despite the turmoil in their lives, just wanted to run.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mau4AmYt3zqe7EOAnY3p7srFNUH.jpg", "actors": ["Zola Budd (Herself)", "Mary Decker (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "kMCTO51uHUE"}
