But trying to get an audience with her elusive, agoraphobic publisher Maury (Daniel von Bargen) is only part of her problem. Her first story requires the toppling of the corrupt and perverted administration run by Mayor Plumb (Dick Boland) and his band of off-kilter hoodlums. However, Betty has unlikely allies to help her bring down the mayor: a pair of petty thieves, Volga (Russ Russo) and Billy (Thomas Edward Seymour), a golden-hearted prostitute Jess (Margaret Rose Champagne) and a transvestite ex-Marine hitman, Sgt. Stone (Phil Hall).", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
