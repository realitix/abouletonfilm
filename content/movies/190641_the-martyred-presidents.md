It opens on a scene showing a mourner with bowed head sitting in front of what appears to be a tombstone. Shortly afterwards, the face of Abraham Lincoln and then of two other presidents, Garfield and McKinley, can be seen on the monument and then they disappear. There is a figure huddled at the foot of a statue of Justice, as if asking forgiveness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yGpUEln0khzAzFZW3gsfX8lBOrP.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [139873, 121466, 191911, 196401], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
