He'll swap places with commoner Eugene Lenormand, sneak into Paris, then Lenormand will reveal himself and Napoleon will regain his throne. Things don't go at all well; first, the journey proves more difficult than expected, but more disastrously, Lenormand enjoys himself too much to reveal the deception. Napoleon adjusts somewhat uneasily to the life of a commoner while waiting, while Lenormand gorges on rich food.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rpbYJOBwgpeL375YioY3OFBazRU.jpg", "actors": ["Ian Holm (Napoleon Bonaparte / Sergeant Eugene Lenormand)", "Iben Hjejle (Nicole 'Pumpkin' Truchaut)", "Tim McInnerny (Dr. Lambert)", "Nigel Terry (Montholon)", "Eddie Marsan (Louis Marchand)", "Tom Watson (Gerard)", "Hugh Bonneville (Bertrand)", "Murray Melvin (Antommarchi)", "Clive Russell (Sergeant Justin Bommel)", "Bob Mason (Captain Nicholls)", "Trevor Cooper (Leaud)", "Chris Langham (Maurice)", "Russell Dixon (Dr. Quinton)", "George Harris (Papa Nicholas)", "Niall O'Brien (Bosun)", "Hayley Carmichael (Adele Raffin)", "Philip McGough (English Tourist)", "Tim Barlow (Bargee)", "Tony Vogel (British Sergeant)", "Russell Tovey (Recruit)", "John McGlynn (Gendarme)", "Clive Mendus (Senior Orderly)", "Ashley Artus (Junior Orderly)", "Roger Frost (Bookseller)", "Tom Hunsinger (Customer)", "Matthew Sim (Ticket Seller)", "Phil Hearne (Man)", "Moya Brady (Woman)", "Caterina Venturini (Barmaid)", "Stefano Gragnani (Bailiff)", "Herv\u00e9 Ducroux (Brest Contact)", "Francesco Guzzo (Sentry at Garrison)", "Sergio Ballo (Lieutenant Truchaut)", "Piero Lorenzo Ferrero (Tailor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [12478, 32053], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
