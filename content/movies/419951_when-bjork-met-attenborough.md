In this remarkable documentary, Bj\u00f6rk explores our unique relationship with music and discovers how technology might transform the way we engage with it in the future. At the heart of the film is Biophilia, Bj\u00f6rk's cutting-edge music project that explores where nature, music and technology meet. David Attenborough explains how music exists in the natural world and speaks about his own passion for music. Author and professor of neurology and psychiatry Oliver Sacks explains the extraordinary and beneficial effects music has on our brains and explains why performing and engaging with music is something all of us should take more seriously.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/frsLCYfJlV9UNTQ7FQ2IWf85MAS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
