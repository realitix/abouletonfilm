As a reporter interviews him in his beachfront home, Capote shares his \"self-regarding\" personality through hip philosophy and calculated jokes. He offers insights in an endearingly raspy voice about his latest book, 'In Cold Blood', which Capote declares to be part of a new genre, the \"non-fiction novel.\" Just as the Maysles brothers' direct cinema classics turn real stories into narratives, Capote's non-fiction novel makes an effort to turn reality into art. In Cold Blood is based on first-hand accounts of an actual murder. The author affectionately discusses his coverage of the subsequent trial and his intriguing relationship with the two young killers. Capote claims it is the spontaneity of life that compels him to portray reality, but it is his own fresh energy and startling sense of humor that keep us intrigued.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jcHSWFG0bj6qzEaDTEsTEFWzuaX.jpg", "actors": ["Truman Capote (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
