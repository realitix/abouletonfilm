The solo exhibition features a spatial narrative installation that delves, through movement, texture, sound, and gesture, into the psychology of a recurring figure in Bass' previous films; while also introducing two new characters, blending the past into the present. Bass has designed the installation by altering the gallery, leading the viewer through a evocative memory of place, embedding us in a timeless society of lost souls in a haunted landscape.  -Allison Peters Quinn, Exhibition Director, Hyde Park Art Center", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tIQVs3eKUEM0iInz8g0y1v3kPhA.jpg", "actors": ["Sarah Stambaugh ()", "Bryan Saner ()", "Matthew Goulish ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
