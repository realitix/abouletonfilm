The woman has had it with endless, meaningless twaddle from each of her husband's friends about what they think, feel, or do. She needs something more than what she faces each day, and finally blows up at her husband like a pressure cooker venting steam. The aftermath is not without its effects on both husband and wife.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
