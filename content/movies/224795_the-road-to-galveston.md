Up against the wall, she took heart from the suggestion of a friend, a blind woman who was a nurse: enter a foster care program in which one takes care of patients in their own home. The patients she cares for are Alzheimers sufferers, and she shares her home with three other women in advanced stages of the disease, one (Gayle) wheelchair bound. And with these women, Jordan realizes a lifelong dream - to feel the ocean breeze. An accidental find of a coffee can stash of cash, buried by her late husband, makes the trip possible. Based on the true story of Peggy Lee of Camilla, Texas (the Alzheimers, the patients, and the foster care program are actual, the trip to the Galveston beaches is fictional).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2XPUPn7HoN1sNg3TjyKNzZCm9UG.jpg", "actors": ["Cicely Tyson ()", "Piper Laurie ()", "Tess Harper ()", "James McDaniel ()", "Starletta DuPois ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
