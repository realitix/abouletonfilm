Not essential viewing by any stretch of the imagination, mind you, but definitely worth a watch. Most of it is about an amateur night talent show, a precursor of the contemporary 'Gong Show' that I watched as a child, back in the day. Worth investigating for the adventurous animation aficionados out there."}], "recommandations_id": [146731]}
