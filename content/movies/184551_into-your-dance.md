A quartet sings \"Go Into Your Dance\" in honor of its originator, Al Jolson. They introduce the conductor, who is a pig caricature of orchestra leader Paul Whiteman. One of the musicians plugs the pig's tail into a light socket so he conducts at super speed. Then Captain Benny announces the start of the amateur hour, with an operatic cow and a tough guy reciting poetry with sound effects.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/pYAgOkUVeI67Vlhqc0eQ0EgY7WR.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [{"pseudo": "talisencrw", "content": "This was a decent early colour Friz Freleng cartoon that was an extra on my 'Annie Oakley' DVD from my Barbara Stanwyck TCM 4-pack. Not essential viewing by any stretch of the imagination, mind you, but definitely worth a watch. Most of it is about an amateur night talent show, a precursor of the contemporary 'Gong Show' that I watched as a child, back in the day. Worth investigating for the adventurous animation aficionados out there."}], "recommandations_id": [146731], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
