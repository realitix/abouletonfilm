In All About Meteorology, young students will see how meteorologists can predict the weather for the upcoming week and even a few months down the road through scientific deduction and high-tech equipment. Students will visit with Dr. Jon Nese, chief meteorologist at The Franklin Institute Science Museum in Philadelphia, to get an up-close look at the equipment that meteorologists use to forecast the weather and explore such concepts as the water cycle and air pressure. Through a fun, hands-on demonstration, see how students can set up their own mini-weather station to monitor conditions in their own areas. Part of the multivolume Weather for Children DVD Series. A Teacher's Guide is included and available online.b", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
