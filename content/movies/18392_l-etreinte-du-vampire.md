Alyssa obviously wanted to shed her chaste kid-star image from Who\u2019s the Boss and she does so as she\u2019s shown top nude and almost naked on several occasions (I should specify that no one\u2019s genitals are ever shown). Some dreamlike sequences are awkwardly hedonistic and mere excuses for erotic semi-nudity. The film starts weak with an inferior rip-off of the Dracula\u2019s three brides\u2019 seduction of Jonathan Harker in \u201cBram Stoker\u2019s Dracula\u201d (1992).\r\n\r\nAs far as the story goes, I like the coming-of-age at college element with Harold Pruett playing the likable beau and Jordan Ladd the prissy biyatch. Charlotte Lewis is on hand as a photographer who\u2019s interested in something more than merely photographing Milano\u2019s character. Meanwhile Jennifer Tilly has a small role as an oversexed pub patron. So there\u2019s some good in this movie that makes it worthwhile but, for me, the good is canceled out by the semi-porn elements.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot at Shattuck-St. Mary's School (a college-prep boarding school) in Faribault, Minnesota.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C-"}], "recommandations_id": [86600, 78552, 46302, 282901], "youtube_key": "vojrKsiKix8"}
