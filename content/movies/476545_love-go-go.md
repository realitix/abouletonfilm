Pudgy Liu Chi-sheng works in his aunt's bakery and is secretly in love with the beautiful girl who comes in daily to buy a lemon pie. He shares an apartment with the rotund Lily Wu who eats to fulfill her hunger for love and spends the rest of her time fantasizing about romance. The third character, Liao Ah-sung, sells personal defense tools door-to-door. Liu thinks the lemon-pie girl may be someone he knew in school. Lily Wu's fantasy life goes into overdrive when she finds a man's lost pager and hears an intriguing message. Problems arise when Liao falls in love with the same woman as Liu.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
