Zoey Brooks (Jamie Lynn Spears) decides to be one of the first girls to become a student at Pacific Coast Academy. Very exciting, but also very scary. Fitting in at a new school is hard enough, but going away to a boarding school and living on your own at age 13 can get crazy, especially when the girls are heavily outnumbered by the boys. The main DVD program will feature a double length episode plus two bonus episodes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dy7iSZUnSYaS6ghzK6EDenT3MAv.jpg", "actors": ["Jamie Lynn Spears (Zoey Brooks)", "Paul Butcher (Dustin Brooks)", "Sean Flynn (Chase Matthews)", "Victoria Justice (Lola Martinez)", "Christopher Massey (Michael Barret)", "Alexa Nikolas (Nicole Bristow)", "Erin Sanders (Quinn Pensky)", "Matthew Underwood (Logan Reese)", "Michael Corbett (Malcolm Reese)", "Allen Evangelista (Firewire)", "Ronnie Sperling (Chauncy)", "Napiera Groves (Kyra)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
