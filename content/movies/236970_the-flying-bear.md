His plane is a cute little prop that's not only much smaller than the jets but much more anthropomorphic. Once they get aloft, the plane goes after a pelican out of sheer playfulness, but it turns into an all-out war. The pelican finally demolishes the plane. The plane and Barney plummet to the ground, where they land in the seats of a much larger plane. Barney is clearly unfamiliar with the controls, and takes them on a harrowing trip high into the atmosphere, where they freeze solid until they crash into \"Ceiling Zero\"; once again, they are demolished and plummet to Earth. In the hospital, Barney and his plane have adjoining beds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7AikUhaF8uFaeJ2S7xgE5dSvPGZ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
