Using the words of Acts 27 from the Bible and techniques he learned as a police officer and crime scene investigator, Cornuke probes every angle of this 2,000-year-old mystery to prove the historical accuracy of God's Word and determine if the anchors originally found by Maltese fishermen in the 1960s and early 1970s are indeed remnants of Paul's misadventure at sea.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vOwXLCzNXYl8NOxexePs1dCYXr3.jpg", "actors": ["Bob Cornuke ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
