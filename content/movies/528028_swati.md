Swati is a strong advocate of women's rights in a society where there is significant male domination. Swati deals with eve teasers firmly, sometimes with considerable force. When a married friend of hers gets raped in the presence of her husband, she acts as a counsellor and helps them adjust to the reality of a society that blames the victim and not the rapists. Swati takes on a huge transformation when she meets a political activist and falls in love with him. She embarks on a project of matchmaking for her mother and engineers a wedding with a widower who has a grown-up daughter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yvxHGVNkkeaFLAtbAUXT903qTZI.jpg", "actors": ["Shashi Kapoor ()", "Sharmila Tagore ()", "Meenakshi Seshadri ()", "Vinod Mehra ()", "Madhuri Dixit ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
