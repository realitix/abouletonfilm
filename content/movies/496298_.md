If your eclipse glasses or viewer are damaged or scratched \u2013 even a little \u2013 or if viewing makes your eyes hurt, even a little, stop looking! Beware of fake eclipse glasses.  We are expecting very large crowds. Those attending should expect extensive traffic congestion and long walks from parking. Wear comfortable shoes, a hat, and sunscreen. Bring water.  Consider taking public transportation! Ride the DASH Observatory bus (special service starting at 8:00 a.m.) from the Vermont/Sunset Metro Red Line station.  If parking near the Observatory (including around the Greek Theatre and along Western Canyon Road) is full, vehicle access to Griffith Park via the Vermont and Fern Dell park gates may be suspended.  Do not bring lawn chairs or any other furniture to the event.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k7GtcU4jJiXmmmfR5ivEr2PVmZl.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
