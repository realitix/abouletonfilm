The design and print industries used a variety of ways to get type and image onto film, plates, and finally to the printed page. Graphic Means is a journey through this transformative Mad Men-era of pre-digital design production to the advent of the desktop computer. It explores the methods, tools, and evolving social roles that gave rise to the graphic design industry as we know it today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1hsaP84aSTuEZPW6FJBlC9aJPz2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
