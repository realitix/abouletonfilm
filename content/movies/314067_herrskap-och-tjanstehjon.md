Then an unusually cheeky figure pops up and throws all plans. She calls herself Truffaldina (Eva Rydberg) and seems free from what respect and label is called. Since an accident rarely comes alone, Rasponi now also enters the action and addresses all common concepts of the perishability of life. And it will not be less difficult when a gentleman from Torino, named Florindo, arrives at Venice and enters the same inn as Rasponi. Now it is for Brighella's innkeeper to take the vagina in beautiful hand and keep my good in bad play.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i3uGxITeB5svZu1gd7S0Gffa90L.jpg", "actors": ["Eva Rydberg (Truffaldina)", "Ulf Brunnberg (Herr Pantalone)", "Ewa Roos (\u00c4nkan Lombardi)", "Birgitta Rydberg (Herr Frederigo Rasponi)", "Kalle Rydberg ()", "Sanna Ekman ()", "Alexander Karim ()", "Malin Sternbrink ()", "Magnus Skog ()", "Keijo J.
