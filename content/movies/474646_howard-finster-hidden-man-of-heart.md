Walking and talking in his Paradise Garden, Finster gives insight into his visions, Faith, and artwork. He even sings and plays the banjo.  Dr. George Pullen interviews Finster. And in this case, the word \"interview\" means that Dr. Pullen just lets Finster talk. And it's pure gold.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/l05q5MPQNUUvBzP5IUO6eDFgCya.jpg", "actors": ["Howard Finster (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
