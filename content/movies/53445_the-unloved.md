Lucy is eleven years old. Having been neglected by her estranged mother and father, she is placed in a children's home. Through her eyes, we follow Lucy's struggle to cope with the system. Her saving is her self-belief and her certainty that she is being watched over and protected by the holy spirit. Hers is a heroic quest for love, beauty and transcendence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lNvvC20Wgq9ULUHnUOA1K6R5uPT.jpg", "actors": ["Molly Windsor (Lucy)", "Robert Carlyle (Lucy's Father)", "Susan Lynch (Lucy's Mother)", "Craig Parkinson (Ben)", "Andrea Lowe (Vicky)", "Lauren Socha (Lauren)", "Michael Socha (Michael)", "Johann Myers (Johann)", "Karl Collins (Karl)", "Christopher Russell (Connor)", "Darren Campbell (Darren)", "Kerry Stacey (Jackie)", "Ladene Hall (Ladene)", "Penny Morton (Penny)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [32119, 109614, 41554, 64191], "youtube_key": "MtOWMORQTrE"}
