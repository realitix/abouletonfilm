This is NOT a traditional war film, and the epic events of the battle take place almost entirely off screen. Instead, Todorovsky outlines a crude love triangle between three young people caught up in the harsh Russian winter. The stark winter settings, and the characters' struggle for survival, are what make this film one worth watching.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zLe86C6c7VQLZfNLGf6FshaU5Jp.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
