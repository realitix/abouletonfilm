Drugs, poverty, disease, bigotry and prostitution all figure into this disarmingly candid and often hilarious film, a remarkable work that is the apotheosis of director Spheeris\u2019 early work, and a luminous signpost leading directly to The Decline of Western Civilization (1979-1997).  16mm, color, 22 min.
