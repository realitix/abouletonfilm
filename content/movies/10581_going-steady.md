Thankfully this was tossed in a 50-film megapack, 'Drive-In Movie Classics'--otherwise, from the producers, director, and no-name cast involved, I would likely never have come across it.

The 50's songs and complete lack of any sort of pretension are overwhelmingly refreshing and appreciated!\r\n\r\nI had no idea that this was in fact a sequel (another name for it is 'Lemon Popsicle 2') and part of a series. I would certainly love to track the other films down..."}], "recommandations_id": [10583, 10584, 38172, 10582], "youtube_key": "kg-7y0c7YFs"}
