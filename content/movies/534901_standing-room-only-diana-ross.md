Beginning with the star\u2019s face projected on a large screen, mouthing the words to her #1 hit \u201cAin\u2019t No Mountain High Enough,\u201d the scene cuts to Miss Ross (draped in furs and jewels, of course) sauntering down a white, almost surreal staircase.  At the bottom of the stairs \u2013 during the joyous, climactic crescendo of the song  \u2013 she suddenly bursts from the screen and onto the stage, greeted by the screams and cheers of an overwhelmed audience.  Those lucky enough to be at these shows literally watched a superstar come to life before their eyes; incredibly, the impact is equally great when watched on a television screen decades later.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5T5X8BFH9NecbPw7IupHBHEpCre.jpg", "actors": ["Diana Ross (Herself)", "Tracee Ellis Ross (Herself)", "Marvin Gaye (Himself)", "Rhonda Ross Kendrick (Herself)", "Chudney Silberstein (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
