Shot in Venice, Verona, Mantua, Padua, and Brenta, the film ventures to actual sites De Vere visited in 1575-76, including the settings for THE MERCHANT OF VENICE, OTHELLO, ROMEO & JULIET, and TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA. The film features renowned Shakespeare scholars, actors, and directors, including Sir Derek Jacobi, Mark Rylance, Tina Packer, and Diane Paulus, and argues that De Vere's bisexuality is the reason for the pseudonym Shake-speare.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zbuGYuD59d258ifebEmqicBB3Qr.jpg", "actors": ["Derek Jacobi ()", "Gregory Paul Martin ((voice))", "Tina Packer (Herself)", "Diane Paulus (Herself)", "Mark Rylance ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
