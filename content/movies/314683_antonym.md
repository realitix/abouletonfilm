Vain and self-centred Aya is forced to find a writing partner to work on the radio script she is developing. Heavily reluctant to collaborate, she partners shy co-worker Sachiko, who eagerly embraces the project. Peppered with coincidental occurrences and failed relationships, and powered by the friction and growing friendship between the women as they work on the script, Antonym is as much about the inevitability of human connection as it is about the necessity of it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bNQxE6vhDcFGyOl39V3iEdSKM4p.jpg", "actors": ["Yuri Ishizaka (Aya Sawai)", "Asami Shibuya (Sachiko Fukada)", "Kuniaki Nakamura (Hiroto)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
