Pursuing a reflection on the emotions felt by the individual and generated by the masses, singers from the internationally renowned Chorus of the Teatro Real perform alongside dancers of Alain Platels company les ballets C de la B in a spectacular presentation of excepts from Verdis and Wagners distinct works.  Many works of Giuseppe Verdi and Richard Wagner are linked to the liberal revolutions of 1848, the \"\"Springtime of Peoples\"\", that swept away absolutism in Europe.
