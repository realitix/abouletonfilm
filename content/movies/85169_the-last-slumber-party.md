A few boys drop by and the beer flows like wine. Just good, clean, fun-loving kids.  But the girls have another visitor, one they don't yet know about. Hiding in the house is a homicidal maniac who has just escaped from a mental hospital. Armed with a scalpel, the nut slashes a little here, a little there as he sneaks from room to room.  One by one the guests start disappearing. What evil lurks there? What nightmare world have they entered?  The plot is twisted inside out leaving you stunned and clinging to your chair as you witness shock after horrifying shock. The ending will leave you breathless.  And now, the blood flows like wine.  Features a heavy metal rock sound track by FIRSTRYKE.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y1k6vP3rJeasuUCaX4wrG7iARRG.jpg", "actors": ["Jan Jensen (Chris)", "Nancy Meyer (Tracy)", "Joann Whitley (Linda)", "Danny David (Tommy)", "Lance Descourez (Billy)", "David Whitley (Dr. Sickler)", "Rick Polizzi (Science)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [89763, 31286, 353467, 81937], "youtube_key": "XHo0Cl-_0KU"}
