They engage a girl (skinny) but have not much confidence in her. She engages two servants to help her with her heavy duties. Together they amuse the prince and his assistant, mostly in the swimming pool inside the villa and in various beds. For some reason the two crooks put Castel in bondage, but she manages to escape. However the crooks have been fooled because the diamonds were fake. All ends well.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/wVYKGnGwKScGJ13CDR4KKhCk2HT.jpg", "actors": ["Catherine Castel ()", "\u00c9lisabeth Bur\u00e9 ()", "Emmanuelle Rivi\u00e8re ()", "Mannuella Marino ()", "Miriam Wateau ()", "Alban Ceray ()", "Richard Allan ()", "Jean-Marie Metthey ()", "Gilbert Servien ()", "Jacques Marbeuf ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
