To make matters worse, big engines Gordon and James side with the ill-tempered lifter and the little guys get nervous and begin making mistakes on the job. They redeem themselves, however, when Cranky topples in a storm and Thomas and his buddy put him back upright. Other stories feature twin engines Bill and Ben having \"teething troubles,\" Toad the brake van's forward-thinking ambition, grumpy Gordon crashing through a station wall, and storyteller Alec Baldwin adopting a falsetto as Lady Hatt, Sir Topham Hatt's wife and birthday girl. In lieu of a seventh story, a chorus of kids sings \"Night Train\" while the model trains steam through darkness in a series of dramatic scenarios.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kGqzpEdLkODFjHisWZg8HAUTp42.jpg", "actors": ["Alec Baldwin ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
