Kin has saved her money, and has become a wealthy money-lender, spending her days cold-heartedly collecting debts. Even her best friends, Tomi, Nobu, and Tamae, who were her fellow Geisha, are now indebted to her. For all of them, the glamor of their young lives has passed; Tomi and Tamae have children, but their children have disappointed them. Kin has two former lovers who still pursue her; one she wants to see, and the other she doesn't. But even the one she remembers fondly, when he shows up, proves to be a disappointment.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/urxbIYMznvPFC4UuQJ5FIbYn6W.jpg", "actors": ["Haruko Sugimura (Kin)", "Ken Uehara (Tabe)", "Sadako Sawamura (Nobu)", "Chikako Hosokawa (Tamae)", "Yuko Mochizuki (Tomi)", "Hiroshi Koizumi (Kiyoshi)", "Ineko Arima (Sachiko)", "Bontar\u00f4 Miake (Seki)", "Daisuke Kat\u00f4 (Itaya)", "Haruna Kaburagi ()", "Yoshiko Tsubouchi ()", "Yaeko Izumo ()", "Tsuruko Mano ()", "Toshiko Nakano ()", "Takuz\u00f4 Kumagai ()", "Masayoshi Kawabe ()", "Akira Tani ()", "Sonosuke Sawamura (Sentaro)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [55584, 36872, 77285, 46493], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
