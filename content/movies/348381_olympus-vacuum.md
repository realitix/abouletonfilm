From national icons like Gardel, Evita, Che, and Maradona the film dialogs with recent Argentine history and it does so with extraordinary energy, supported by a rarely seen use of all kinds of archive material in an almost Dionysian state of sampleadelia. The film arrives to a surprising reflection on nationalism, demagogic governments and delusions of unanimity; problems that are common to emerging societies that cannot find their ways to a freer and more egalitarian society.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rSALshxNyDKHsYqCQLnZiGDCWju.jpg", "actors": ["Carolina Azzi, Pablo Racioppi (Directors)", "Juan Jos\u00e9 Sebreli ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
