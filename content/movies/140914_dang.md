For this year, DANG! will have exclusive footage filmed by the 4FRNT team, as well as some contributed footage from our athletes. DANG! embodies what everyone wants from skiing: having fun with friends in cool locations. Whether it's good snow, or bad, sunny skies or clouds, at the end of the day, you're still skiing, so it was worth it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/s9l0elMGTcE2R9xx9eIHfiy22yu.jpg", "actors": ["Eric Hjorleifson ()", "Wiley Miller ()", "Cody Barnhill ()", "David Wise ()", "Andy Partridge ()", "Finn Anderson ()", "Mack Jones ()", "Nick Miles ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
