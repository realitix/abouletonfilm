It appears that guys are committing crimes just so that they can be locked up to serve some Hard Time. Who can blame them with a prison staff like Adam Herst, Angelo, Jimmy Durano, and Landon Conrad! There's never been a hotter lineup on the police roster; just ask repeat offenders JP Dubois, Sam Barclay, Alexander Gustavo, and Maruc Ruhl.
