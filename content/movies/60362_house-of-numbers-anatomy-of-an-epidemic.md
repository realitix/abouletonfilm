This is the first film to present the uncensored POVs of virtually all the major players; in their own settings, in their own words. It rocks the foundation upon which all conventional wisdom regarding HIV/AIDS is based. House of Numbers could well be the opening volley in a battle to bring sanity and clarity to an epidemic gone awry.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/j9NeBvUC3QDbMmClLp7Ogr2Rs0J.jpg", "actors": ["Luc Montagnier (Himself)", "Francois Barre-Sinnousi (Herself)", "Anthony Fauci (Himself)", "Kenneth Cole (Himself)", "James Curan (Himself)", "David Baltimore (Himself)", "Donald P.
