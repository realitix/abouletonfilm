Recorded specially for BBC Four at TV Centre, it's a stripped-down, intimate performance, with no set and minimal lighting - a painfully raw, honest and deeply funny exploration of disconnection and loneliness.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qdZLsTrFO0n87n0dMXaLlrr0xof.jpg", "actors": ["Simon Amstell (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
