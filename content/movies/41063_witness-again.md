The film was created in a tense political climate at a time when talking about the 1950s and the 1956 Revolution was still taboo. Although it was financed and allowed to be made by the communist authorities, it was subsequently banned from release. As a result of its screening in foreign countries, the communist authorities eventually relented and allowed it to be released in Hungary. It was screened at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival in the Un Certain Regard section.[1] A sequel was made in 1994 named \"Megint tan\u00fa\" (English: Witness Again).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3aF4gfnXxTxWjKKMvmoCNAKyehY.jpg", "actors": ["K\u00e1llai Ferenc (Pelik\u00e1n J\u00f3zsef)", "Gy\u00f6rgy Cserhalmi (Szip\u00e1k B\u00e9la)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
