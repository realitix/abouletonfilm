Tarzan, the Gigolo, Andynamite, Priscilla, La Rage, Eddie Dark... they all dream of becoming professional wrestlers, like their teacher. Salvatore fought with top wrestlers for more than 30 years, particularly within the prestigious WWF. Today, he has decided to bring his students to the U.S to follow the traces of his past. Waiting for the big day, they live out their passion together, sometimes taking foolish risks to satisfy the local audience and lay out their future.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Salvatore Bellomo (Himself)", "Eddie Dark (Himself)", "Jean Le Boucher (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
