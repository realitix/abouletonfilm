Senior lecturer Sarah Goode believes the most promising way to reduce the number of child-abuse cases is to encourage people to seek treatment before they target victims. Her theory is supported by an interview in this programme in which Humphries meets a man who makes an extraordinary confession on camera.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ci77KFLnZvTgrlJIOY1MtCCdEem.jpg", "actors": ["Steve Humphries (Himself - Narrator)", "Sarah Goode (Herself (as Dr Sarah Goode))", "Corine de Ruiter (Herself - Forensic Psychologist (as Prof. Corine de Ruiter))", "Sarah Forsyth (Herself)", "Edward Chambers (Himself (as Eddie))", "Tim Tate (Himself - Investigative Journalist)", "Jon Brown (Himself - Head of Strategy, NSPCC)", "Ian McFadyen (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [424988, 302818], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
