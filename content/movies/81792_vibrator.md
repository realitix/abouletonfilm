We first meet her in a convenience store where she is buying too much alcohol and not enough food. At the magazine rack she pauses to contemplate the happiness of the glamour girls on the glossies for which she writes. Only later do we realize that this is self-reflection. A chance encounter with truck driving Takatoshi, leads to a two day romp of sex, friendship and introspection. It's unclear if what happens to her is the product of her writer self imagining it all as a magazine serial (hence the inter-titles and voice of the narrator).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mb0ONIUid0BertT0iFC0JZg8X7S.jpg", "actors": ["Shinobu Terajima ()", "Nao Omori ()", "Tomoro Taguchi ()", "Riho Makise ()", "Miki Sakajou ()", "Eriko Takayanagi ()", "Masahiro Toda ()", "Eugene Nomura ()", "Jun Murakami ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [258562, 81791, 125858, 70870], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
