The DVD edition includes over forty minutes of outtakes and interviews with Benjamin, bonus live footage of Smoke, and performances of unreleased tribute songs by Cat Power and Vic Chesnutt.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/f76skGFGWL4VSDtpZbYuQL67epW.jpg", "actors": ["Benjamin Dickerson (Himself (as Benjamin))", "Patti Smith (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
