With FX that looked primitive in FOOD OF THE GODS (1976) rendered even more primitively, this is worth it for the tortoise, which is meant to be scary as our protagonists run (???) from it and try to avoid its rubbery head as the thing looms in a window by way of a very obvious broomstick.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hJ0wfGeGXKcAhZtq6PLvrkn4A9W.jpg", "actors": ["Vladimir Antonik ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
