Elly is a working student, scholar and is now a candidate to become the class valedictorian. His father is quite idealistic and incorruptible, which explains why his family still remains so poor. Charismatic Elly works part-time as a student assistant and he has indirect access to confidential school papers. He has earned the trust of the school staff, and because of this, it would not be difficult for him to get hold of this year's final exams-the one which his best buddy Simon and their other friends need to pass in order to graduate.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Cedric Jose (Elly)", "Jaclyn Jose ()", "Michael De Mesa ()", "Meila Romero ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "7f39U0A47Wk"}
