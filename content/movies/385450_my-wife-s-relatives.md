It all begins when Joe Higgins (James Gleason), business manager of a prosperous candy-manufacturing firm, is ordered by his pompous boss Ellis (Purnell Pratt) to break up the romance between Ellis' son Bill (Henry Arthur) and Joe's daughter Jean (Mary Higgins). Refusing, Joe quits his job and sets up his own candy company. It's a money-losing enterprise until Joe's wife Lil (Lucille Gleason) loses her diamond ring in a batch of candy and offers a $5000 reward to anyone who can retrieve the ring.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/A6vHjKr3T3lLB2Ol44MsRJ4OImM.jpg", "actors": ["James Gleason (Joe Higgins)", "Lucile Gleason (Lil Higgins)", "Russell Gleason (Sidney Higgins)", "Harry Davenport (Grandpa Ed Carson)", "Lynne Roberts (Jean Higgins (as Mary Hart))", "Tommy Ryan (Tommy Higgins)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
