The usual commentary has been omitted and in its place poems and songs in Bahasa Indonesia have been included in a digital sound composition.  In Mother Dao the Turtlelike, the viewer sees how the colonial machinery in the 1920s was implanted in a world so different from Western Europe.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5CltSp1Howc28Z0N7GzzqOF0IGd.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
