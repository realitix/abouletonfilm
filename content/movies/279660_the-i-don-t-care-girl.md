Eddie's version is that he discovered her working as a waitress in an Indianapolis restaurant in 1912, wherein singer Larry Woods and his partner Charles Bennett get into a fight over her and both land in the hospital, and McCoy convinces the manager to put Eva on as a single to fill their spot. She flopped, but McCoy arranges for Bennett to be her accompanist, and she went out of his life. The writers look up Bennett, now head of a music publishing company, who says McCoy's story is phony, and it was Flo Zigfeld who discovered Eva for his Follies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yaJhqHPRmpWUNQUfz4vA5zPdb55.jpg", "actors": ["Mitzi Gaynor (Eva Tanguay)", "David Wayne (Ed McCoy)", "Oscar Levant (Charles Bennett)", "Warren Stevens (Lawrence)", "Craig Hill (Keene)", "Hazel Brooks (Stella Forrest)", "Bob Graham (Larry Woods)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
