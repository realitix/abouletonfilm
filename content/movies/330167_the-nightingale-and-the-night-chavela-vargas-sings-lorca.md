Poetry and music are the places of their meetings. Chavela explains when he lived in the same room where Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca lived decades ago, was visited by a bird that contained the soul of the Spanish poet. In her last year of life, Chavela fulfills her last wish: to make a tribute to Spanish poet and finally meet him in the ranks of death. The Nightingale and the Night is a documentary that chronicles the transition from Chavela life to death, her union with Federico, dissolving the borders between reality and dreams.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fV6D40rNyPEYTj8qfAvStM32CTH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
