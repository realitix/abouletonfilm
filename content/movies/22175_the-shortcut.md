As its title suggests, AVOID THE SHORTCUT avoids being a dull rehash of tired cliches and insteads plays with these loved horror conventions to create an exciting and very well made horror film. If you want to take a break from the constant flurry of torture porn flicks, then take a look at this creepy chiller. A great story, interesting characters and a very twisted villian make this a surprisingly fun and enjoyable movie!"}], "recommandations_id": [46302, 55861, 69270, 60950], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
