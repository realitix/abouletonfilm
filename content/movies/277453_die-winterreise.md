Each of the song cycle's interwoven stories involves travelers undertaking a \"winter journey\" together by carriage. Mezzo-soprano Brigitte Fassbaender provides beautiful, soaring vocals.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yxosduNVNFnzfWuvdfPcQffK6Ul.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
