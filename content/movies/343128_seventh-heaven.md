The film is a simple observation of a group of staff and teenage pupils in the corridors, art rooms, exclusion room, and an empty classroom used as a makeshift mosque. With panoramic views of London, the seventh floor is a place of partial escape where the relative freedom of activity and empty space are the questionable outcomes of a disintegrating education system.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gBD1UInjkTLLhCyIcMizx84Jk5x.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
