He is mostly a storyteller who paints unforgettable pictures in modern parables to illustrate his simple faith. Even though he has many university degrees, he continues to speak the simple language of an ordinary farm boy from northern Saskatchewan. He only speaks of a simple faith that he learnt on his mother's knee and from living with a dozen brothers and sisters. Later he claims he learnt \"bigger and better prayers at the seminary, but only learnt to pray on his mother's knee\". This DVD is a live recording of his highly popular parish mission. You will hear father there give a down-to-earth presentation of his face that is simple, humorous, refreshing, inspirational and good for the heart in soul.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uu1MCuHw42D4CgmMyT1nLVGtzJx.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
