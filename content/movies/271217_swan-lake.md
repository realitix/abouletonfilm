Princess Odette (Gillian Murphy) is captured by the evil sorcerer Rathbart (Isaac Stappas) and cursed to be changed into a swan. Young Prince Siegfried (Angel Corolla) is being pressured by his mother (Georgina Parkinson) to find a bride. Irritated, he runs out into the woods and finds Swan Lake, where Odette has become queen of the swans. He learns that only by someone swearing eternal love to her can the spell be broken, and he does so. At a ball, numerous princesses are paraded before the prince, who shows little interest. But when Rathbart, in human form (Marcelo Gomes), arrives with his daughter Odile (Murphy), enchanted to resemble Odette, Siegfried is deceived. Swearing love to Odile, and betraying Odette, he may have condemned her to spend the rest of her life as a swan.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hMac6LVdTN9a6XLQHrP6YRmUBhc.jpg", "actors": ["Gillian Murphy (Odette / Odile)", "\u00c1ngel Corella (Prince Siegfried)", "Marcelo Gomes (von Rothbart, an Evil Sorcerer)", "Isaac Stappas (von Rothbart, an Evil Sorcerer)", "Georgina Parkinson (Queen Mother)", "Frederic Franklin (Wolfgang, the Tutor)", "Herman Cornejo (Benno, friend to Siegfried / Pas de Trois)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "C6eqJSw3e9g"}
