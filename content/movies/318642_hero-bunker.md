From an outpost on the Greek-Albanian border, a military truck unexpectedly comes under fire by Italian tanks. Petros, the only one who manages to escape death or captivity, saves a village girl, Maria. However, the Greeks manage to recapture the machine-gun nest, setting free the soldiers who had been pinned down. The platoon in question puts up a hard fight against the Italian invaders, while, at the same time, the Greek army is preparing for a counter-attack, which doesn't take long to happen. Right after, the Italians are forced to fall back; Northern Epirus is recaptured, and the army of the Badoglio is repulsed from the Adriatic.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kKnGtFt1EjPK5LNlK8Ggy8o92r3.jpg", "actors": ["Giannis Voglis (Petros)", "Xenia Kalogeropoulou (Maria)", "Nikos Dimitratos ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
