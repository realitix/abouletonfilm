Kukuruku builds a castle using dolls transformed from men as building parts. The story revolves around the sorrow and terror of men who have been transfigured into dolls, and a girl named Cherry who wishes to recover the kindness in her brother, who is a student of Kukuruku. This work reminds us of the fact that \"transformation\" or \"transfiguration\" --- favorite themes of Tezuka Osamu --- involves not only material aspects, but also man's immaterial heart [Taken from AniDB]", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xG9cJlugwqj92ooeRrRsIJw0WER.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
