Robbed of his position, power and wealth, his enemies have left him in isolation. But this is no ordinary man, and this no ordinary island. Prospero is a magician, able to control the very elements and bend nature to his will. When a sail appears on the horizon, he reaches out across the ocean to the ship that carries the men who wronged him. Creating a vast magical storm he wrecks the ship and washes his enemies up on the shore. When they wake they find themselves lost on a fantastical island where nothing is as it seems.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/tZ3CJmR7ovMNmxj8HKvpo7cL1bN.jpg", "actors": ["Simon Russell Beale (Prospero)", "Jenny Rainsford (Miranda)", "Oscar Pearce ()", "Mark Quartley (Ariel)", "Joe Dixon ()", "James Tucker ()", "Daniel Easton ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
