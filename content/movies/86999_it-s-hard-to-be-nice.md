Fudo doesn't earn much, so he supplements his income by offering tips to the local criminal syndicate and turning a blind eye to their nefarious dealings. One day, after offering a particularly bad bit of advice to a violent gangster, Fudo is badly beaten. When Fudo's wife Azra (Daria Lorenco) discovers what has happened, she decides to take the couple's infant son and move out. Now determined to win his wife back and restore peace in the home, Fudo decides to go straight. But cleaning up his act isn't going to be easy, because after borrowing enough cash from black market dealer Sejo (Emir Hadzihafizbegovi\u0107) to purchase a van and then refusing to aid him in any underhanded dealings, the only person willing to cut him any slack is the sympathetic Azra.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8h56mRCYdwxHCXGhALBVxxmkJbK.jpg", "actors": ["Sa\u0161a Petrovi\u0107 (Fudo)", "Daria Lorenci Flatz (Azra)", "Emir Had\u017eihafizbegovi\u0107 (Sejo)", "Damir Savi\u0107 (Beba)", "Danijal Savi\u0107 (Beba)", "Senad Ba\u0161i\u0107 (Bato)", "Jasna \u017dalica (Medicinska sestra)", "Nerman Mahmutovi\u0107 (Mutavac)", "Aleksandar Seksan (Mrki)", "Izudin Bajrovi\u0107 (Doktor)", "Sanja Buri\u0107 (Gatara)", "Ejla Bav\u010di\u0107 (Cvje\u0107arka)", "Zana Marjanovi\u0107 (Trudnica)", "Jasna Beri (Punica)", "Armis Ma\u0161i\u0107 (Arap)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
