The film follows a police investigation into four murders and charts the doomed romance of the outlaw lovers. A deeply romantic, elegiac and universal crime story where the murders are not the point of the movie.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/daEx3lQHdcKBKGzluoKDrinD7mF.jpg", "actors": ["Brandon Auret (Piet)", "Gys de Villiers (Muller)", "Danny Keogh (Klippie)", "Frank Opperman (Stoffel)", "Cara Roberts (Joline)", "Marcel Van Heerden (Du Plessis)", "Drikus Volschenk (Strijdom)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
