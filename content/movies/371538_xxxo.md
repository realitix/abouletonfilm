It features M.I.A. in a number of headshots amongst glittery floral graphics, resembling those made on Blingee.com. At one point in the clip, four white unicorns gallop across the screen. Golden Arabic-style calligraphy spells out her name and, at another point, the phrase \"click here to download\", written in a similar font, scrolls diagonally across the screen. The YouTube screenshots featured on the cover of the Maya's album also appear in the video, in various video feedback sequences. The video ends with the MySpace refrain \"Thank you for adding me.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2EzlZg8VaPcZdgTJrDsGQfwSw6H.jpg", "actors": ["M.I.A.
