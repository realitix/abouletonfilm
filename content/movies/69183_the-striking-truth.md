Both are inspiring stories and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. I liked the film a lot. Both fighters pour their hearts out and we get a fantastic look at their strengths but also their vulnerabilities and fears.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kLnmOuYgpPjlAvzXxWBGPbefKQZ.jpg", "actors": ["Georges St-Pierre ()", "David Loiseau ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "teq8XePhiX0"}
