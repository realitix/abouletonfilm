One summer day a number of older people had gathered for a bus ride along the winding country roads in Lumparland, and to relive old memories. At the same time one of the locals, Putte Karlsson, took up a large project: rebuilding the old mill in Lumparby. The mill was owned by his grandfather, skipper and farmer in the village. Sawmills previously existed in many villages in \u00c5land Islands but today they are no longer in use. It is a big challenge and many are skeptical that Putte will put everything to work.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sqXzbmZtmtARmFJnS89ypGvNLGN.jpg", "actors": ["Putte Karlsson (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
