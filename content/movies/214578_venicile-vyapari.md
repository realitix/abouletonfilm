The story revolves around Pavithran (Mammootty), who lost his parents in his childhood. He enters the police force by chance, though it is not his ambition to do so. Pavithran lands up in Alappuzha (Alappuzha incidentally is attributed to the sobriquet, Venice of the East) disguised as a merchant to investigate the murder of a union leader named Ajayan (Biju Menon). Another character is Ammu (Kavya Madhavan), who is the leader of the union of coir workers and is in love with Pavithran.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/97gHs0xbve5iCA0z6klzHjYh4es.jpg", "actors": ["Mammootty (Pavithran)", "Kavya Madhavan (Ammu)", "Poonam Bajwa (Lakshmi)", "Suraj Venjaramoodu (Chandran Pilla)", "Salim Kumar (Kamalasanan)", "Vijayaraghavan (Chungathara Raghavan)", "Jagathy Sreekumar (Kaladi Govindan)", "Biju Menon (Ajayan)", "Suresh Krishna (Chungathara Aniyappan)", "Janardhanan (Radhurama Varma SP)", "Saju Kodiyan ()", "Guinness Pakru (Kochukrishnan)", "Abu Salim (Abdu)", "Anjali Aneesh Upasana (Ammu's friend)", "Kalabhavan Shajon (Isthiri Lonappan)", "V K Sreeraman ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [320742, 278221, 469302, 280201], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
