Her best friend is a modest servant, Anselmo, who almost everyday takes the girl to visit the church known as \"Guadalupe's Basilica\", an important cathedral in Mexico City, where she discovers Virgin Guadalupe and the legend about her apparitions in that place. Marita doesn't behave properly in school, and her teacher always has a punishment for the girl. She doesn't like school, and she doesn't want to return to school anymore. Besides, Marita's worried about her animals, like a cow who doesn't produce milk. The girl asks many miracles of Virgin Guadalupe, one of them is to not have to go to school. During a visit to the Basilica, Marita hears the Virgin's voice, and this could be the beginning of a responsible life for the girl, like to study and to be a good child.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gmWnGK7cXBtoHtiF7x4oL2nLAXI.jpg", "actors": ["Mar\u00eda Gracia (Marita)", "Jorge Mart\u00ednez de Hoyos ()", "Prudencia Grifell ()", "Miguel Manzano ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [94656], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
