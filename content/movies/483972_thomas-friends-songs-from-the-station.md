There are more adventures around the bend with two new stories: \"Thomas and the Tuba\" and \"Thomas and the Firework Display\" with storyteller Michael Brandon. All aboard for Thomas' latest sing-along, engineered for fun!", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/n6ru3SRrYYUEVwk9hFpKO14312u.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
