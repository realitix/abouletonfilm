Unfortunately, the other half goes to Easterner Barbara Erwin (Carol Hughes), who is only interested in monetary remuneration. To convince Gene to buy her share, Barbara enters into an unholy alliance with unscrupulous attorneys Arnold (Ivan Miller) and Fry (Sam Flint), who, without their client's consent, hire a gang of thugs headed by Tommick (John Merton). When a ranchero (Elias Gamboa) is mortally wounded in the ensuing gun battle, Barbara sees the error of her way and switches sides.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lxzPY0Hb37xeweFvmBihKbhFELW.jpg", "actors": ["Gene Autry (Gene Autry)", "Smiley Burnette (Frog)", "Carol Hughes (Barbara Erwin)", "Frank Darien (Benjamin Peabody)", "Joe Strauch Jr. (Tadpole (as Joseph Strauch Jr.))", "Pauline Drake (Kitty Callahan)", "Ivan Miller (Arnold)", "Sam Flint (Fry)", "Elias Gamboa (Jos\u00e9 Ortego)", "John Merton (Henchman Tommick)", "Jack Kirk (Sheriff)", "Inez Palange (Mrs. Romero)", "Burr Caruth (Dr. James Ware)", "Champion (Champ - Gene's Horse)", "Tommy Coats (Henchman)", "Joe De La Cruz (Miner)", "Art Dillard (Henchman Mason)", "Curley Dresden (Dark- and Thick-Mustached Henchman)", "Chick Hannan (Henchman)", "Frankie Marvin (Cowhand)", "Frank McCarroll (Henchman)", "Pascale Perry (Henchman Mike)", "Ernest Sarracino (Ramon Alverez)", "Lee Shumway (Arthur Sloan)", "Hal Taliaferro (Announcer Smoky)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
