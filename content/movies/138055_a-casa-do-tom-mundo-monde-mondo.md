It contains previously unreleased pictures and images captured for 15 years by Ana Jobim, his wife, that show details of the life and work of Tom Jobim.  Shot in New York, Rio de Janeiro and the family ranch in Po\u00e7o Fundo, the film shows his intimacy with his children, the birth of important songs, parties at home with other musicians, and even a unusual Jobim in pajamas, in an \u201cexpedition\u201d in the woods. \u201cWhen someone visits the intimacy of a great artists, possibly the distance between him and the myth is felt to be smaller. For me it is the opposite; the distance becomes greater and I have more conscience of the myth\u201d, says Ana.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hYS6MFvvrMarN8mJGXtyyJu4HYc.jpg", "actors": ["Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim (Self)", "Ana Jobim (Narrator)", "Dorival Caymmi (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "1l8JO0q0fDc"}
