It is a picture of birth, love, and death of the old nations living in the misty forests of this land. In a winter, when men crimson the white snow with the blood of the deer, a child is born. His mother recites him the love story of the spring, of the mystery of the flowers' colors, and of the love toward his father. And the father's restless life, gazing at the far away, finds calmness in death in the cold winter.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/shUgh9sXs7DlBddIXFROqGWMCNY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
