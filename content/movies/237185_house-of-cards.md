He stares out the window seeing children playing and a well-dressed man sitting on a chair in the middle of the street reading a newspaper and looking up at him. A headline describes the murder of a child. The disheveled man, whose face expresses fear and despair, leaves, going through the city, alarmed when anyone looks at him. A woman invites him to look through a public telescope. He does then keeps going. He climbs a hill. Two fencers appear; so does a jester. Is flight fruitless?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bpUoXjY30H0mjiCZuWj3jZFMsId.jpg", "actors": ["Crane Whitley ()", "Gail Roberts ()", "Harriette Ann Gray ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
