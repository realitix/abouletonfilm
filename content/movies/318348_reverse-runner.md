But that's not a bad thing at all, plenty of laughs.**\r\n\r\nThe poster brags with \"presented by the director of THE MIGHTY DUCKS\" but make no mistake, the director of \"THE MIGHTY DUCKS\" was only the executive producer of the film. Which 99 times out of 100 only means that they helped finance it and nothing else.\r\n\r\nAnd based on how low-budget the film actually is I don't think he chipped in too much money for it.\r\n\r\nNo it's directed by some people with little experience, and it shows. But Dan Cannon (also a bit of a newb) is funny and the jokes are mostly funny so it doesn't matter too much.\r\n\r\nThe style of humor is in the veins of HOT ROD and DODGEBALL, but with an Australian twist (it's an Australian film). It's not quite as good as those, but it could have been if the circumstances of the making of the film was better. But that said, it's still entertaining."}], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
