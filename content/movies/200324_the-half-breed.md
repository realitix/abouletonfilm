Fairbanks stars as Lo Dorman, who has been ostracized from society because of this mixed ethnicity - his Native American mother was abandoned by his white father. When Lo catches the eye of the rich white debutante Nellie (Jewel Carmen), he becomes a target for the racist Sheriff Dunn (Sam De Grasse), who wants to break them up and take Nelli for his own. This love triangle becomes a quadrangle with the arrival of Teresa (Alma Rubens), who is on the run from the law. Through fire and fury Lo must decide who and what he truly loves.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/d66a73MZGiEfmD1KmTf7WdYeam5.jpg", "actors": ["Douglas Fairbanks (Lo Dorman)", "Alma Rubens (Teresa)", "Sam De Grasse (Sheriff Dunn)", "Tom Wilson (Curson)", "Frank Brownlee (Winslow Wynn)", "Jewel Carmen (Nellie)", "George Beranger (Jack Brace)", "Elmo Lincoln (The Doctor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
