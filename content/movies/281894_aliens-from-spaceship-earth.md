{"tmdb_id": 281894, "title": "Aliens from Spaceship Earth", "original_title": "Aliens from Spaceship Earth", "slug_title": "aliens-from-spaceship-earth", "date": "1977-01-01", "genre": ["Documentaire"], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "Tries to prove that all great men of the past were actually aliens.  While the aliens in this film may seem to be quite human, one must realize that this film is dealing with close encounters of the fourth kind. An inner space journey triggered by the drug culture and rebellion of the sixties, and the non-violent search for self that continues among people in today's culture. Could this be due to some influence from a higher spiritual consciousness? The world's alien leaders are well represented in this film: Baba Muktananda, Swami Satchidananda, A. C. Bhaktivedanta, Guru Maharaj Ji, Yoga Bhahan, Sri Sathya, Sai Baba, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Father Yod, Baba Ram Das, and well-known personalities who present their views on seeking their own terrestrial individuality. Whether inspired by a more highly evolved race than earthlings, or from a visit millions of years ago by space aliens, Aliens from Spaceship Earth are causing great changes on our planet today.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zaN19Ntw2qv3b7pkUhREG333uZm.jpg", "actors": ["Srikanta Dasa Adhikari (Hare Krishna)", "Sathya Sai Baba (Himself)", "Yogi Bhahan (Himself)", "Raymond Burr (Himself)", "Ram Dass (Himself)", "Rennie Davis (Himself / Host)", "Lynda Day George (Herself)", "Donovan (Himself / Host)", "Mukunda Goswami (Hare Krishna)", "Robert 'Ramesvara' Grant (Hare Krishna)", "Martin Landau (Himself)", "Swami Satchidananda (Himself)", "Cybill Shepherd (Herself)", "Leigh Taylor-Young (Herself)", "Jan-Michael Vincent (Himself)", "Father Yod (Himself)", "Elizabeth Clare Prophet (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
