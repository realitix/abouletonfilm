It is perfect timing as she has to find a way to come up with the ultimate reality show to outdo her American-accented pan-Asian rival. Eric Tan (Peter Davis) is a mild-mannered, half-English corporate slave who, like Pong, works for the Fony Corporation. He labours to create the perfect Soyamaker Machine but is constantly assailed by unreasonable insults from his megalomaniacal CEO bosses and is in love with Pong.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4zcur5sCZnxwmXjC6TE5ETis2bW.jpg", "actors": ["Jerrica Lai (Rafflesia Pong)", "Peter Davis (Eric Tan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "jaLH_8RCGwE"}
