Linked to the rest of the country by a vague muddy track and a stretch of railway line, the village lives in a suspended and mysterious dimension. This is the Russia of endless forests and potato fields. A few robust and uncompromising characters work calmly there, driven by no vital needs. This is a still happy and cold Russia.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jkVb0RJHEuexzj0cBrGUaDyzYFO.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
