There were 8000 people in attendance and the show drew a 4.5 rating on TBS. This show set up Starrcade '88. It was on this show that TBS/NWA experimented with a top down camera angle, which did not catch on. This is comparable to the \"refer-eye\" camera from Halloween Havoc '91.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lyoQz5IzMH9uzbEeSQ9mbHEk10Z.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
