The loyal employees really stood out, many working there decades or their whole working life. Not bad for an overgrown hot dog stand.. Unfortunately and to no one's surprise, some family members cared more about profits than people and the brand went downhill. Today, some faceless corporation gives us an average product at best.\r\n\r\nWish this would have had more about Nathan, a bit too much time spent on his greedy, no business sense brother."}], "recommandations_id": []}
