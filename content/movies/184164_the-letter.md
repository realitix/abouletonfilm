Dew started to feel true love for her new acquaintance. They eventually married and began a peaceful life together.  Everything was fine until Ton died after a serious illness. Now Dew is alone again, but then something strange happens: she receives a letter-- a love letter --in familiar handwriting. It's from Ton.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/3fYauKazef9vhSpYqbSX14TUM0P.jpg", "actors": ["Attaporn Teemakorn (Ton)", "Anne Thongprasom (Dew)", "Supitsha Junlawattaka (Ked)", "Rawat Promrak ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "lEpbv1Ik-8c"}
