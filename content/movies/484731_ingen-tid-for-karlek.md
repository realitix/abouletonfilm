Schlager diva, Operetta hero, filth musical innovator, enfant terrible, compulsive liar and amoral rogue. Johnny Bode (1912-1983) was very successful in Sweden and Europe. Yet he is today almost completely forgotten. Why? His life was so overwhelming, glamorous, fast and bizarre. So un-Swedish. He became fascinated by the nazism. Was arrested by the Gestapo and detained at Grini concentration camp in Norway. For five weeks. After the war he moved to East Berlin and proclaimed himself a dear friend of the GDR. Later he was deported and returned to Sweden. A time of fencing and small crimes followed. Escaped to Brussels at first and later Vienna. He was, as Juan Delgada, hired by the Vienna Opera to create new operettas. And was very successful. Johnny Bode died exhausted alone and abandoned in Malm\u00f6 during the summer of 1983.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mMsaNyCAO1hrqoycF6WeuBoKOLh.jpg", "actors": ["Johnny Bode ()", "Ingmar Norl\u00e9n ()", "Mattias Ehn ()", "Lillemor Dahlqvist ()", "Bo Sj\u00f6kvist ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
