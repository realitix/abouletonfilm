Soueid shows us scenes of El Kurdi\u2019s domestic world: eating, applying make-up, dancing in her bedroom, all while reflecting on her life and experiences. She expresses her desire to undergo gender reassignment surgery, and mourns the death of her lover, a Palestinian freedom fighter. She often alludes to the aggressions she faces outside of her home, and through her adept defiance in the face of some of Soueid\u2019s more goading questions, we recognize the echoing of these aggressions in his role as interviewer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aMqPLW2WxjpI7HF3xOjSNdZhPbO.jpg", "actors": ["Khaled El Kurdi (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
