Not Jim and Jamie Dutcher. Raising a pack of gray wolves from puppies, they were able to film their growth, development, and changing behavior. Wolves at Our Door, the sequel to Wolf: Return of a Legend, explores these beautiful animals as they live in America's Northwest. Excellent footage captures the wolves playing with each other and with the Dutchers and allows us a glimpse into another world, one that's not so scary after all. You're sure to see these marvelous beasts differently after watching Wolves at Our Door. --Rob Lightner", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6TqX09tZ6m7zllJz9Ia4ieI2T1l.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
