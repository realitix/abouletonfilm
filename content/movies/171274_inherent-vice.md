It boasts a great soundtrack, brilliant acting and a very convoluted story as it tells the story of a private detective (Phoenix) as he investigates into the disappearance of a former girlfriend.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is very confusing. It is hard to follow and purposely so as it introduces many characters and multiple stories but I have heard that this aspect of the screenplay is very true to the original source material. All I could do was admit that the film was too bewildering and to enjoy the many jokes and humorous situations.\r\n\r\nJoaquin Phoenix is tremendous as the main character Larry \"Doc\" Sportello. He is complimented with a great supporting cast such as Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro.\r\n\r\nOverall, 'Inherent Vice' is not a typical popcorn flick and I was very confused by the overwhelming plot.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd"}], "recommandations_id": [68722, 8051, 86829, 4995]}
