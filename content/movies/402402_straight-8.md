They bought a load of old super 8 film cartridges and sent them up to various filmmakers. The challenge to each was to make a 3-minute film without any edits or post-production and not to see that film until it is shown in front of a live audience and on television. Attracting well-known directors and students alike, the project spawned quite a following as well as this short television series, showcasing about 10 of the shorts over two episodes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qQFrMPFpGJltctQT96SzJJwrYu.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
