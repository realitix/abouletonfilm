One of the\r most commercially successful German comic book creators, he is best known for books\r like \u201cSchwulComix (GayComix)\u201d that offer a twisted take on queer culture. Equal parts\r Tom of Finland and R. Crumb, K\u00f6nig\u2019s comics are sexually charged and often politically\r incorrect, portraying daily routines of gay life alongside serious subjects like AIDS.  King of Comics is a touching portrait of a cutting-edge artist with a wicked sense of humor. All hail the king! \u2014Jimmy Radosta", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rDnuSWjO7LWG6EPawJQumhQal7q.jpg", "actors": ["Ralf K\u00f6nig (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "z0QXlEsU-b4"}
