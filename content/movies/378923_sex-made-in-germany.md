But Germany has also succeeded in securing a leading position in Europe by means of a very special service: prostitution. For the very first time, this documentary lifts the lid on how sex tourists from all corners of the globe come to Germany to enjoy a brothel holiday, with punters from Europe, the USA and Asia. The price-performance ratio is internationally as good as unrivalled. For six days and nights, the brothel holidaymakers make their way from one amusement institution to the next. At the top of the itinerary are the so-called flat rate 'whorehouses', where one payment secures as much unlimited sex and drinks as one wants. It's a side of Germany most people have never heard of - let alone seen.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9KmojFdzCLVBPiqtI26EtMM6mfH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
