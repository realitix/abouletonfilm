Frieda Inescourt stars as lady jurist Mary Cabot, who 20 years earlier had lost contact with her infant daughter Justine. Now a grown woman (played by Rochelle Hudson), Justine accidentally shoots a man who'd impugned the reputation of her mother, whom she's never met. As luck would have it, the presiding judge at Justine's trial is none other than Mary Cabot-who up until the film's climax never realizes that she's holding the fate of her own baby in her hands.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/asC38VGXtPTlOs8t9JSygQ21REg.jpg", "actors": ["Frieda Inescort (Mary Cabot)", "Otto Kruger (Steven Graham)", "Rochelle Hudson (Justine West)", "Mayo Methot (Gertie)", "Gordon Oliver (Robert Langley)", "Arthur Loft (Tim Ryan)", "Walter Fenner (Harper)", "John Dilson (Ramsey)", "Ben Hewlett (Wolf)", "Beryl Mercer (Mrs. Butler)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
