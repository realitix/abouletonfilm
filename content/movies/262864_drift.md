She suffers from a lingering illness. He helps her find her peace. Left alone, he escapes reality and starts to wander. DRIFT explores his quest for salvation on a mythical journey through a barren Romanian wasteland. Fighting his memories, the drifting man chooses not to speak and to loose himself in an animal-like and primitive existence. His simple but painful rituals echo an ancient culture long forgotten. As the past reveals itself, insanity sets in. Slowly, he disappears as well.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/9ewJ1OHOaqX8nI0K1KS82WVxzkv.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
