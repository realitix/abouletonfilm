Instead of money the teenagers have a stash of grass waiting for a buyer. Food? Nothing wrong with the leftovers from other people\u2019s plates. Tent? Why bother when you can sleep under the stars. Sleep? No way: the party goes on all night. V is a pretty girl who knows how to use her charms to the best advantage. Betty, more reserved and shy, never quite knows what to do with her hands, how to hold a cigarette, what to say to the boys they meet. But the tables are turned when the pair go their separate ways after an argument.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ruUnPn5x1OEwchLJvUxFgIV9gST.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
