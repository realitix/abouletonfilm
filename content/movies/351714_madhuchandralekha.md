Chandramathi (Urvashi) is his illiterate, rustic, betel-chewing wife with a bad habit of spitting in wrong places, and they have four children. It can be described as incompatible matrimony but still a happy one. Madhu loves his wife even though they are out of sync because she has brought him luck. Here enters Lekha (Mamta Mohandas), a sophisticated urban model-cum-singer, who finds a place in the hearts of all the family members. Chandramathi thinks Lekha will be the perfect wife for her husband and a good mother for her children.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/nfovnCxa2Hs3aw1KR6JC12uAU9J.jpg", "actors": ["Jayaram (Madhu)", "Urvashi (Chandramathi)", "Mamta Mohandas (Indulekha)", "Cochin Haneefa (Abootty)", "Indrans (Lukose)", "Harisree Ashokan (Digambaran)", "Kundara Johny (Shanmugham)", "Bheeman Raghu (Arumugham)", "Sukumari (Chandramathi's grandmother)", "Kalasala Babu (Ramu)", "Tom Jacob ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
