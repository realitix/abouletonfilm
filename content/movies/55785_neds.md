Gar\u00e7on brillant, la voie est cependant loin d\u2019\u00eatre toute trac\u00e9e pour lui, entre un p\u00e8re violent et les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s de ses professeurs qui n'ont pas oubli\u00e9 son fr\u00e8re a\u00een\u00e9 \"irr\u00e9cup\u00e9rable\", Benny, devenu membre des NEDS. Les NEDS (Non Educational Delinquents), dangereuses petites frappes, font r\u00e9gner la terreur dans les quartiers. La r\u00e9putation de Benny vaut \u00e0 John d\u2019\u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9 et lui ouvre tr\u00e8s vite les portes du gang.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5i5IO2MzAGqTiwnD6VffVtdMQDR.jpg", "actors": ["Conor McCarron (John McGill)", "Mhairi Anderson (Elizabeth)", "Martin Bell (Julian)", "Joe Cassidy (Janitor)", "Linda Cuthbert (Mrs Matheson)", "Alex Donald (Mr. Halligan)", "John Joe Hay (Fergie)", "Gary Lewis (Mr. Wilkinson)", "Richard Mack (Gerr)", "David McKay (Mr Holmes)", "Peter Mullan (Mr. McGill)", "Marcus Nash (Patrick)", "Marianna Palka (Beth)", "Steven Robertson (Mr Bonetti)", "Douglas Russell (PC Connelly)", "Paul Donnelly (Mr Hendry)", "Stephen McCole (Mr. McLeod)", "Gary Hollywood (PC Muir)"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "Kenneth Axel Carlsson", "content": "A boy, John McGill, gets a rough start on his education when a much older boy threatens him. Fearing for his life, he enlists the aid of his older brother, Benny, who can take care of business, and does. From this moment on, everything starts to get worse. Soon John finds himself part of a gang, nearly killing another boy (boys really), but it gets worse. One day he even beats his father (I think, or maybe his uncle) and then he is forced to live on the streets.\r\n\r\nThere is definitely violence in this movie, but not so much as one would expect, and it's not so pointless as one could fear. John is as much a victim himself, as a bully, and if we feel sad for his victims, we must also feel sad for him. His life could have turned out much different, but a single event changed his life forever. However, that doesn't mean that he can't, if he wish to do the work, change it back.\r\n\r\nLast words... don't worry, there is a great lesson to be learned from this movie, so don't miss out. The very last image will haunt you forever..."}], "recommandations_id": [25476, 21900, 56725, 15201]}
