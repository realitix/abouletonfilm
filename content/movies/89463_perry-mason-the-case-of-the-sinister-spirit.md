They have come to the hotel as all of them are going to sue David over his new book - \"The Resort\" which characters are obviously based on Jordan and the guests. A practical joker, David plays tricks on them until he is thrown from the high tower of the hotel where Susan Warrenfield, the manager and owner of the hotel sees the fall and then Jordan at the tower causing the police to arrest Jordan. While Perry and Della try to solve the main mystery, Paul tries to find out who is trying to scare Susan away from the hotel. Could it really be a ghost or a more earthy visitor?", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1jhx6PXigL8IcLlDdFJEr3CbFl6.jpg", "actors": ["Raymond Burr (Perry Mason)", "Barbara Hale (Della Street)", "William Katt (Paul Drake Jr.)", "Robert Stack (Jordan White)", "Kim Delaney (Susan Warrenfield)", "Dwight Schultz (Andrew Lloyd)", "Leigh Taylor-Young (Maura McGuire)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [80809, 225525, 227667, 229081], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
