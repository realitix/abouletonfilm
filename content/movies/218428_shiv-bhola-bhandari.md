Mrikandu rishi and his wife Marudmati worshipped Shiva and sought from him the boon of begetting a son. As a result he was given the choice of either a gifted son, but with a short life on earth or a child of low intelligence but with a long life. Mrikandu rishi chose the former, and was blessed with Markandeya, an exemplary son, destined to die at the age of 12. Markandeya grew up to be a great devotee of Shiva and on the day of his destined death he continued his worship of Shiva in his aniconic form of Shivalingam. The messengers of Yama, the god of death were unable to take away his life because of his great devotion and continual worship of Shiva.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hWrQJVIeCqisZZO2WV71puCoINd.jpg", "actors": ["Bharati ()", "Dwarakish ()", "Rajesh ()", "Puspa ()", "T.
