In La Gonave, only 25% of families have unpolluted water to drink. Disease is rampant. One in five children will die before their 5th birthday. This film follows a group of guys who work selflessly to change those statistics by bringing fresh water to the Haitian people.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
