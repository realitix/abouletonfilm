These conventional images, born from countless vampire films over the years, are most commonly associated with Irish writer Bram Stoker and his iconic 1897 novel Dracula. However, despite the popularity and influence of this celebrated nineteenth-century tome, the vampire myth dates back more than 1,000 years, long before Stoker ever put pen to paper. In this fascinating journey through time, HISTORY uncovers the ancient folkloric origins of blood-craving creatures from beyond the grave. Learn how the vampire myth is strongly rooted in Eastern European lore, but how it has also played a prominent role in the ancient cultures of Greece and China.  From wooden stakes to garlic apotropes to ancient burial rituals, VAMPIRE SECRETS explores how this long-standing myth has been interpreted by different cultures around the world.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6P2FDXqkIbiK69t3TUdQAyDQKBW.jpg", "actors": ["Deborah Rombaut (Demon Woman)", "Elise Angell (Maid)", "Corey Burton (Narrator)", "Jeff De Lucio-Brock (Hungarian Farmer)", "Christa Bella (Elizabeth Bathory)", "Kari Wishingrad (Bathory Chambermaid)", "Peter Stack (Ficzko)", "George Mauroy (Bram Stoker)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
