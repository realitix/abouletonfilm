The Plant Kingdom, with its multiplication of simple forms, is invoked to provide an explanation. A succession of points of view and the details of a bush in full bloom are photographed frame by frame: a culminating cycle of daisies. In every shot the position of the camera, the frame, the focal distance and the focus are corrected. The continuity of forms and the relationship between dimensions produce a choreographic illusion. We were not trying to recreate movement, but rather stop it, to produce static continuity between what were, in themselves, different shots.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ckEMdCKXdfG9j4KB4jabraOqgmh.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
