A young man in a somewhat abusive gay relationship slowly loses his mind and becomes a serial killer, slashing random people in the streets. There's a next-door neighbour obsessed with capturing sounds and eavesdropping, another neighbour who has an S&amp;M relationship with a girl that seems to unsettle and trigger violent and confusing thoughts in the young man, and there's a gay painter who becomes obsesed with the young man. Violence escalates and becomes chaotic, but none of their behaviour makes any sense.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ej2Ng08O2Fm47vhtfFG7pr6q5wY.jpg", "actors": ["Yuichi Araki ()", "Yoshihisa Nemoto ()", "Kunio Masaoka ()", "Yoji Tanaka ()", "K\u00f4ichi Imaizumi ()", "Sh\u00f4ko Kud\u00f4 ()", "Takeshi It\u00f4 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
