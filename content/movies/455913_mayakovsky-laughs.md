The film also showcases Sergei Yuktevich's fondness for formal experimentation. It is nominally adapted from Mayakovsky's play \"The Bedbug\" and his screenplay \"Forget All About the Fireplace.\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gelWZvYQeJMzEVki1Dj201pWhMR.jpg", "actors": ["Leonid Bronevoy (Oleg Bayan)", "Mikhail Gluzskiy (Professor)", "Aleksei Kapler ()", "Anatoli Pereverzev (Mayakovsky)", "Ia Savvina (Zoya Berezkina)", "Galina Volshek (Madam Renaissance)", "Natalia Zashchipina ()", "Tamara Sovchi (\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0443\u0447\u043a\u0430)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
