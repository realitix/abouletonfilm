As she is being reprimanded in Mrs. Bredwell's office, a misunderstanding results in a member of the football team arriving at the office with Ann's clothes--she had left them behind when she changed into a football uniform so she could play football with the team--and Mrs. Bredwell writes to Ann's father notifying him that Ann is being expelled.
