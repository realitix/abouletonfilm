On the way we prepare by taking to the track at Monza \u2013 the home of Italian Formula One. We try to get noticed on the road course in Monaco in a Bugatti, a Lamborghini and a Model T Ford. After cruising the canals in Venice we take to the tarmac and things look good - thanks to the Ferrari F12 Berlinetta and Mercedes SLS Black. Throw in a Pagani Huayra, Porsche Cayman S and a GT3 as well as the Aston Martin Vanquish centenary edition, Bentley V8 convertible, Rolls Royce Phantom coupe and the face-bending BAC Mono all seems pretty perfect to us.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/H0ubMwHXcf31892kfhN9pyRKLy.jpg", "actors": ["Jeremy Clarkson (Jeremy Clarkson)", "Richard Hammond (Richard Hammond)", "James May (James May)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [301235, 144942, 146548, 42101], "youtube_key": "Qy7pOMM5yX0"}
