Although they manage to sneak alcohol at home and in water bottles at school, they never get caught. One night, while at a per-graduation party, Lizzie, Janie, and their friend Kate get completely drunk, and Lizzie decides to drive Janie home. While blasting the music in the car, with rain pounding on the windshield, Lizzie crashes the car. She escapes with a concussion, but Janie isn't so lucky - she dies in the twisted metal. What happens is a depiction of the aftermath of tragedy, and the recovery process of an alcoholic. Gruesome dramatization of a horrific car accident, and depiction of a DWI trial.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mMsHu688qDPWxi6QXhmfxYKnRc9.jpg", "actors": ["Donna Bullock (Val Williams)", "Matt McCoy (Ray Williams)", "Teryl Rothery (Mrs. Novak)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
