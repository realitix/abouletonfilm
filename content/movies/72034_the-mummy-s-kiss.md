When Hor-Shep-Sut's sarcophagus is found by Dr. Wallis Harwa  and opened by Professor Carter Moore, the professor's fianc\u00e9e, Ana, immediately faints at the sight of the horrific, but somehow oddly familiar mummified remains. As Hor-Shep-Sut awakens from her centuries-old slumber to pursue her long lost love, viewers can rest assured that she will certainly have her fair share of erotic encounters before meeting her ultimate fate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2c8AjgX0ofpP24QEZXDhLw4M7SV.jpg", "actors": ["Mia Zottoli (Ramsay Amun / Hor-Shep-Sut)", "Sasha Peralto (Ana Harwa / Princess Hat-Em-Akhet)", "George Thomas (Professor Carter Moore)", "Aysia Lee (Tina Kim)", "Richard Lynch (Dr. Wallis Harwa)", "Arthur Roberts (Osiris)", "Katie Lohmann (Isis)", "Regina Russell Banali (Helena)", "April Flowers (Yvonne (as Diana Espen))", "Elina Madison (Carrie)", "Rhoda Jordan (Jeannette)", "Kaila Yu (Waitress)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
