Au Congr\u00e8s, le s\u00e9nateur Pablo Neruda critique ouvertement le gouvernement. Le pr\u00e9sident Videla demande alors sa destitution et confie au redoutable inspecteur \u00d3scar Peluchonneau le soin de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'arrestation du po\u00e8te.  Neruda et son \u00e9pouse, la peintre Delia del Carril, \u00e9chouent \u00e0 quitter le pays et sont alors dans l'obligation de se cacher. Neruda joue avec l'inspecteur, laisse volontairement des indices pour rendre cette traque encore plus dangereuse et plus intime. Dans ce jeu du chat et de la souris, il y voit l'occasion de se r\u00e9inventer et de de devenir \u00e0 la fois un symbole pour la libert\u00e9 et une l\u00e9gende litt\u00e9raire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sLvzxFBH5vGFei8oUNzDVwHKGdl.jpg", "actors": ["Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal (Oscar Peluchoneau)", "Luis Gnecco (Pablo Neruda)", "Mercedes Mor\u00e1n (Delia del Carril)", "Emilio Guti\u00e9rrez Caba (Picasso)", "Diego Mu\u00f1oz (Mart\u00ednez)", "Alejandro Goic (Jorge Bellet)", "Pablo Derqui (Victor Pey)", "Marcelo Alonso (Pepe Rodr\u00edguez)", "Michael Silva (\u00c1lvaro Jara)", "Francisco Reyes (Bianchi)", "Jaime Vadell (Jorge Alessandri)", "N\u00e9stor Cantillana ()", "Alfredo Castro (Gabriel Gonz\u00e1lez Videla)", "Marcial Tagle ()", "Amparo Noguera (Drunk Woman)", "Cristi\u00e1n Campos ()", "Victor Montero (Rub\u00e9n Az\u00f3car)", "H\u00e9ctor Noguera ()", "Luis Vitalino Grand\u00f3n (Border guard in Argentina)", "Roberto Far\u00edas ()"], "comments": [{"pseudo": "Reno", "content": "**Chile's own catch me if you can!**\r\n\r\nIt was Chile's Oscars pick. It made into Golden Globe, but not the Oscars. After I disliked his previous film, looks Larrain back in action. Though, not entirely. This was a biopic, more or less a Chilean version of 'Catch Me If You Can' with a less intensity in its contents. If you are a fan of this director's narration then you might enjoy it. But I thought it was a little boring, due to slow moving story. Especially, half of the film was a background narration than the direct dialogues between the characters. The issue was, it was like someone in the bed, ill and they are narrating a tale. Too low voice like whispering which is equal to lullaby.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, now and then there were some fine scenes. It was a cat-mouse game. But nothing thrilling enough like you would expect from a cop chasing a bad guy films. The story was not deep or detail. Only those limited life events of Neruda were present on the screen. Most of them were silly ones, or maybe made it to look like that way. That's why it felt like a dark comedy. From the cop's perspective, don't expect like Sherlock Holmes level. The cast was good. The locations too, but not those projectors clips for backgrounds during vehicles scenes. So just an above average film. Though should have been better.\r\n\r\n**6/10**"}], "recommandations_id": [319995, 305567, 215525, 385808], "youtube_key": "2gFbcBnXx8o"}
