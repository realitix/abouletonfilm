Steve Haley suggests to the ranchers that they band together and drive their herds to Abilene, Kansas and get full price. Steve's friend Smiley \"joins\" the rustlers to learn who their leader is. Grady henchman Doc Walker asks Steve to help break up the cattle drive, and he agrees in order to keep tabs on the rustlers. The gang makes several attempts to take the trail herd but Steve, in his guise as the Durango Kid, intervenes and saves the cattle.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/i8b4RN5ny6VV4zpMs0XvOsqFgvy.jpg", "actors": ["Charles Starrett (Steve Haley / The Durango Kid)", "Nancy Saunders (Nora Grant)", "Hank Newman (Bass Player)", "Smiley Burnette (Smiley Burnette)", "Lane Bradford (Henchman (uncredited))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
