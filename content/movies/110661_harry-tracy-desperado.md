Well, all, except train robber and escape artist extraordinaire, Harry Tracy. As the last survivor of the Wild Bunch, Tracy pulls off a series of profitable robberies before making his way west to Portland, Oregon, in search of Catherine Tuttle -- a judge's daughter who has captured his heart. But on the way, Tracy is betrayed, arrested, and imprisoned. However, no jail can hold him for long and after making his escape, Tracy becomes the target of the largest manhunt in the history of North America.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1MhCeKnRdn1rtFUayeDGjyx4CCR.jpg", "actors": ["Bruce Dern (Harry Tracy)", "Helen Shaver (Catherine Tuttle)", "Michael C.
