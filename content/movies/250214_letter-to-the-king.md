A young man about to be deported visits his former employers to collect his off-the-books salary, a martial arts expert is looking for work, a young woman is haunted by the past and out for vengeance and an old man named Mirza is busy writing a letter to the king to get his final wish granted. An altogether urgent and nuanced portrait of a motley group of individuals, too often regarded as a homogeneous group.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qqlSZLBhNWqb7HxeJNIl69eWUa1.jpg", "actors": ["Ali Bag Salimi (Mirza)", "Zheer Durhan (Zirek)", "Nazmi K\u0131r\u0131k (Miro)", "Hassan Dimirci (Champion)", "Ivan Anderson (Beritan)", "Derin Kader (Lorin)", "Raouf Saraj (Rebin)", "Amin Senatorzade (Akbar)", "Catherine Elisabeth Howells (Hilde)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
