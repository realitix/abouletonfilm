The story is about three women who all live in the same countryside town but who never interact with one another even though they are all tied by the same tragedy. While newly-unemployed Rika tries to get her ailing grandmother to take a needed surgery, she also struggles to come up with the money to pay for it. A mysterious benefactor known to her only as \"K\" might be able to help, but her grandmother is steadfast in telling her to decline it. As Rika searches for clues as to who this \"K\" is, she increasingly finds that she and two other women are linked not only by a tragedy but a chain of flowers as well.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7Aw5wNHvWCua05B8jbgoQd9TY9o.jpg", "actors": ["Nao Matsushita (Rika)", "Miki Nakatani (Miyuki)", "Erika Toda (Satsuki)", "Tori Matsuzaka (Koichi)", "Jun Kaname (Kenta)", "Mitsuko Kusabue (Rika's grandmother)", "Tomomi Maruyama (Yosuke)", "Tsuyoshi Abe (\u68ee\u5c71\u6e05\u5fd7)", "Hitomi Sat\u00f4 (Natsumi)", "Aimi Satsukawa (Kimiko)", "Masumi Nomura (Kurata)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
