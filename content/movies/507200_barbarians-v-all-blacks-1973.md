However, the Barbarians' side was comprised of many of the truly great players of the era - Duckham, Gibson, JPR Williams, Bennett, Edwards, McBride and Carmichael - and together they were to produce a truly remarkable team performance, including a try from Gareth Edwards in the third minute which has proved, with the passage of time, to have been one of the best in the history of the game. Soon, the All Blacks, with outstanding players like Going, Batty and Williams, began to match their opponents' exhilarating quality. As attack and counter-attack brought a fantastic response from the Arms Park, the stage was set for the greatest rugby match ever seen. Special Features: Commentary with Phil Bennett, David Duckham and Gareth Edwards.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zvE5yhqCv6dI5sOLuz36tHHCbB8.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
