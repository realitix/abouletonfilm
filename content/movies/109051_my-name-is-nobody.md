Meanwhile, he and his partners (including that versatile Wong Jing) go to work for the dastardly Lung Fong, who\u2019s a top gang boss in Shenzen. He hires Nobody to swindle high-rollers at his Shenzen casino. However, things go to hell when Candy\u2019s dad (Hui Siu-Hung) arrives at the casino with stolen money from Candy\u2019s account - which was supposed to pay for her eye surgery.  Nobody helps out Pop, but that sets in motion a series of events that can only be described as harrowing. Nobody goes down in a big way and he attempts to struggle back, even invoking the classic line \u201cI want to get back what I lost.\u201d Cue Better Tomorrow theme music.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/62cZKGEdsvjht3790pSK52P17nS.jpg", "actors": ["Nick Cheung (No-Name)", "Shu Qi (Candy)", "Wong Jing (Uncle Lo)", "Monica Chan (Mee)", "Benny Lai Chun (Chun)", "Lung Fong (Mr. Tough)", "Lee Siu-Kei (Ko Fai)", "Hui Siu-Hung (Mr. Chicken)", "Spencer Lam (Priest)", "Carmen Yeung (Mr. Tough's girlfriend)", "Louis Yuen Siu-Cheung (Cheung)", "Lam Suet ()", "Ray Pang Lap-Wai (Scum)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
