This movie, short handed to TMMTFM, is so much fun to watch, and on a DVD (or Blue Ray), you can pause it while you fetch your O2 bottle so that you do not turn blue.\r\n\r\nI will leave it up to proper aeroplanists as to whether or not this is good flying instruction.  However, as a former unit Safety Officer, spotting safety hazards can be a real sport.  I think I counted six at my last use/view.\r\n\r\nResearching material on the internet can be a real diversion.  Although TMMTFM is about airplanes, automotive buffs can get a fix on some splendid specimens, that were before my time."}], "recommandations_id": [11575, 38792, 44071, 25495], "youtube_key": "TO7-_fGqGTg"}
