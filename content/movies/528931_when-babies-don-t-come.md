Having grown up in rural GaModjadji in Limpopo Province, Mainetjie\u2019s modern lifestyle in Johannesburg bares little resemblance to her family\u2019s. As she seeks medical assistance, the high costs and emotional strain are compounded by her family\u2019s dissatisfaction with her \u2018western\u2019 methods.  After continual disappointment, the question: \u2018What is a woman if she cannot be a mother?\u2019 consumes her.  With a rare localized perspective to the topic, Mainetjie takes the audience on a journey through IVF treatment, visits to a traditional healer and practices to gain assistance from her ancestors.  An intimate portrait of infertility, this crucial story speaks to a much bigger issue faced by many, yet largely shrouded in silence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/aHT0lrQbkatxcNVKnqfc6qzFAr5.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
