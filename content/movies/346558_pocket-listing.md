A smart mix of satirical dark comedy and ultra swanky neo noir, \"Pocket Listing\" transports you into a world of excess and wealth but then cleverly turns the table on its main character, plunging him into the depths of despair on the opposite side of the economic spectrum. The hot deal at the heart of the film is where the fun begins, but there's also a lot of humanity and heart to this tale of a crook trying to regain his soul in a world where the only way to survive is to out-thief the thieves."}], "recommandations_id": [497757, 298026, 467924, 295196], "youtube_key": "nncnJ9VHVmk"}
