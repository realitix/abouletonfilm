The virus intends to commandeer this system to one selfish end: to make more viruses. And they will stop at nothing to achieve their goal.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qLlsZeQ6eQwRSsU96U6G8Q0XEvJ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
