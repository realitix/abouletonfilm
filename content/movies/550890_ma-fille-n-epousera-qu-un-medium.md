Jenny thereupon runs away with her lover, Reggie, and the two concoct a little plan by which they can get married. Disguised as a Turk, Reggie calls and states he is willing to marry the spiritualist's daughter. Jenny's father is distracted at the loss of his daughter, so he begs the supposed medium to trace his daughter by occult means. Needless to say this is not a difficult matter to Reggie, who after leading the spiritualist a wild-goose chase over the country, brings him back to his own home (to which Jenny has returned in the meantime) and shows him his daughter hidden away in a cupboard. Tableau of delighted father, unmasking and blessings on the young couple.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
