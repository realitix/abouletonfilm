Covertly, insidiously, mercilessly, a global depopulation agenda has been launched. As this plays out, the vast majority of the human race will be removed from the gene pool. Genetically annihilated. Will you and your genetic lineage survive?  Film-makers Paul Wittenberger (What In The World Are They Spraying?) and Chris Maple explore WHAT are the real threats to your life, your offspring and your genetic integrity? HOW can you protect yourself from those threats? WHY is a global depopulation agenda being pursued? The more you understand these answers, the greater your odds of surviving 'The Great Culling'.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hBAoc1B9bmV12Rc5z1PYYEwyu0y.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "P7BqFtyCRJc"}
