He invited \"subjects\" into his living room to strip down and reveal themselves physically and emotionally through personal stories about their relationship to their penises. Fender interviewed a vast cross-section of anonymous, naked men about their prized appendage: from monks to transsexuals to ex-marines to designers, ranging in age from 21 to 80. Hoping to demystify, illuminate, and even celebrate this \"member\" in our society, this DIY documentary is a candid exploration of what it means to have a dick.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fgf0XACI2tK6kVXFkgpaZA316nY.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
