Jeannie charges next door to bawl out her new neighbor and meets comic-strip artist Bill Carter. Bill has devoted himself to his strip, and raising his ten-year-old son Joe since the death of his wife. Joe bases his strip on the everyday happenings of he and his son and is proud of keeping it scrupulously honest. When Jeannie and Bill fall in love, young Joe is hurt, especially when Bill starts using a lot of the father-son time to be with Jeannie. Bill cancels a father-son trip to Canada, and Joe decides to write a letter to Bill's syndicate pointing out that the current plot line of the script being set in Canada isn't honest, since they didn't go.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lKRlZqnxramHLDisyTU5h4BJ3Zc.jpg", "actors": ["Dan Dailey (Bill Carter)", "June Haver (Jeannie Laird)", "Dennis Day (Reed Appleton)", "Billy Gray (Joe Carter)", "Cara Williams (Rosie Green)", "Natalie Schafer (Evelyn the maid)", "Clinton Sundberg (Samuels the butler)", "Hayden Rorke (Henry Fields)", "Mary Jane Saunders (Kitty)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
