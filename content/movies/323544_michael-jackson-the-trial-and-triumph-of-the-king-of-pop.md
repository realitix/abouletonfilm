The program features hostess Pearl Jr talking to dozens of Michael fans, interviews with key people (Michael's trial lawyer, Jermaine Jackson), some celebrity well wishers (Kanye West, Mo'Nique, Fantasia) and finally Michael's compelling press conference in London in March of 2009. Even in death, Michael Jackson is the world's biggest superstar and perhaps the greatest entertainer of all time. His achievements almost came crashing down during his child molestation trial. This film goes behind the scenes of that sometimes chaotic and outrageous trial. MJ's fans from all over the world always believed in his innocence. -  Ashford &amp; Simpson, Fantasia Barrino, Jermaine Jackson", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
