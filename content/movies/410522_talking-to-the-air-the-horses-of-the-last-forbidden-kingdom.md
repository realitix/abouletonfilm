The Tibetan Buddhist region of Mustang in the High Himalaya is the Last Forbidden Kingdom and their unique heritage and remarkable spiritual bond with the horse is under threat. In a land where a man\u2019s wealth can still be measured in horses, death defying races are the colorful back-drop for this story of the ascent of civilization in the high Himalaya. With lush cinematography, and insightful intervieww, the film also recounts the little known story of the\u00a0CIA\u2019s covert operations in Mustang, and features rare archival footage of the Dalai Lama\u2019s flight on horseback over the Himalaya.\u00a0\u00a0The scholarly and perceptive voices of Dr. Sienna Craig - author of \"Horses Like Lightning\" and Mikel Dunham, author of \"Buddha's Warriors\" turn this lens to issues of globalization, fragile border politics and the precarious future for Mustang\u2019s distinctive equine culture.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/1rsJGn52Ga0LkwKRnYXusein2HK.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "HWRsuUzGVZo"}
