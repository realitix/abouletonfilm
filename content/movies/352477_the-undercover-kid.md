Adults don\u2019t usually believe in talking dogs, but Max is certain that the tip from the would-be assassin\u2019s pet dog is a sure thing. As he and his human and animal friends set out to put a stop to the sinister plan, his parents, the police, and even his bodyguard discredit his suspicion. When Agent Clyde finally begins to catch on, time is running out, and they must act quickly to save the president\u2019s life.
