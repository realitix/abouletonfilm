From their jungle headquarters just north of Singapore, Frank, Ali and a team of native helpers roam the area from Northern Johore to Perak in search of interesting wild animals, reptiles and birds. Hoping to find a tiger, Buck captures a monitor lizard and a black leopard, while another black leopard narrowly escapes an encounter with a giant python and then battles a bigger and stronger tiger. After trapping a spotted leopard, Frank adopts a baby honey bear and a baby elephant. The team catches an orangutan, but the tiger eludes their camouflaged pit. Meanwhile, Frank visits the \"bathing festival\" of a local tribe and watches as tribesmen kill an intruding spotted leopard with blow darts. The tiger then meets an enormous regal python, who has just crushed a crocodile, and fights to a draw with it.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/627GTuODnb1omCNnMuk0JwpNVg5.jpg", "actors": ["Frank Buck (Himself and narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
