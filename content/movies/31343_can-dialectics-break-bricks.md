This is what you'll encounter in Ren\u00e9 Vi\u00e9net's's outrageous refashioning of a Chinese fisticuff film. An influential Situationist, director Ren\u00e9 Vi\u00e9net's stripped the soundtrack from a run-of-the-mill Hong Kong export and lathered on his own devastating dialogue. A brilliant, acerbic and riotous critique of the failure of socialism in which the martial artists counter ideological blows with theoretical thrusts from Debord, Reich and others.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ksmB7ZtINQxFqGx8QvSrosa9nIk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
