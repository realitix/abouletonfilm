The movie begins with his funeral, as he speaks from beyond the grave in a bitter tone about his fate, and takes us through his fame, as he ruins it with womanizing and drink, and his fall, as a lonely, bitter old man unable to reconcile his life's disappointments. The movie is based loosely on the life of Buster Keaton.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/x5xG4PYVAWyN22ZN3G6ZwL5zTT4.jpg", "actors": ["Dick Van Dyke (William Simon aka Billy Bright)", "Michele Lee (Mary Gibson)", "Mickey Rooney (Martin \"Cockeye\" Van Buren)", "Cornel Wilde (Frank Powers)", "Nina Wayne (Sybil Atlas)", "Pert Kelton (Mama Bell)", "Steve Allen (Steve Allen)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "nDFOg7Wcr6s"}
