The opera was the first of many collaborations between Strauss and Hofmannsthal. It was first performed at the Dresden State Opera on January 25, 1909.  Elektra is a difficult work and is musically complex. A performance requires musicians with great stamina. The role of Elektra in particular is one of the most demanding in the dramatic soprano repertoire.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/zEN1j5oqo48VmV2vkrFuphhTeD.jpg", "actors": ["Mignon Dunn (Clitemnestra)", "Birgit Nilsson (Elektra)", "Leonie Rysanek (Crisotemis)", "Robert Nagy (Egisto)", "Donald McIntyre (Orestes)", "John Cheek (Tutor de Orestes)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
