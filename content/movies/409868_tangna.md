Hanging out in a pool hall, Ali Khoshdast becomes involved in a brawl with three brothers, and accidently kills one of them. He runs for his life, eventually taking refuge in the home of a young woman. The victim's brothers continue the chase, and finally close in on him. Following the murder, streets, alleys and houses that were all part of Ali's everyday world suddenly become dangerous and hostile. Although in many ways a classic tale of revenge, Naderi uses this story to imply that an underlying violence pervades society, ready to burst forth with or without justification.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5sMIJhyJV8np4nHgnqpD1xJVWZ0.jpg", "actors": ["Saeed Rad ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "6KKzVkmM2nY"}
