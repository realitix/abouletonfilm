Grandma is bed-ridden and mute, but rings a bell above her head. Her daughter Nina, a museum docent, misses male friendship and both her ex-husbands. Each fathered a daughter: Lida, beautiful, in her 20's, having an affair with her boss, and contemplating a month's vacation with him, and Nastiya, acerbic, 15, in trade school. It's grandma's birthday, so the women prepare a celebration; Nina's new male friend and both girls' fathers come. Lida learns more about her boss, and Nastiya announces she's pregnant just as her ex-boyfriend bangs on the door, drunk. Even grandma has a surprise for the family.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mH5LGX1uJ3k0HawKJXuj4kfIQN8.jpg", "actors": ["Inna Churikova ()", "Svetlana Ryabova ()", "Andrei Tolubeyev ()", "Igor Kvasha ()", "Mariya Golubkina ()", "Andrei Kasyanov ()", "Stanislav Zhitaryov ()", "Rostislav Yankovsky ()", "Galina Kazakova ()", "Vladimir Borisov ()", "Alexandr Filatov (grand father's friend)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [83475], "youtube_key": "D3UsYSNU-Ng"}
