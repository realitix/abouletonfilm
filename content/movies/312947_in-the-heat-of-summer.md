Tak is a gambler, too much so for his girlfriend to risk marriage. Daddy, a single father, is harsh with his son who reminds him of the woman who abandoned them. Monk is mercurial, talkative, a show-off. Kong, a steady family man, keeps the peace. Sam is new, hoping to fit in and make it as a cop. Three brutal and murderous robbers are on the loose, and so is a former soldier, embittered over the loss of his pension, using very real bombs to extort what's due him. It's a dangerous job, and the cops must watch each other's back, regardless of their personal problems.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lZxMK0BjdhEUjswJ6yG0g38NDia.jpg", "actors": ["Jordan Chan (Leung Siu-Ming)", "Power Chan (Daddy)", "Jack Kao (Chan Wei-Cheng)", "Moses Chan (Sam Hui)", "Joe Cheung (Police Commissioner)", "Christine Ng (Maggie)", "Elaine Ng Yee-Lee (June)", "Dolphin Chan Hoi-Hang ()", "Marco Ngai (Tak)", "Michael Lam Wai-Leung ()", "Yee Tin-Hung ()", "Joseph Cheung Man-Kwong ()", "Sze Ning ()", "Alan Mak ()", "Mark Houghton ()", "Siu-hung Chung ()", "Wong Wa-Wo (Policeman)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
