Performers include: Luther Allison: lead guitar, vocals; James Solberg: rhythm & lead guitar; Mike Vlahakis: keyboards; Ken Faltinson: bass; Robb Stupka: drums; and Memphis Horns (Wayne Jackson, Andrew Love).", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Luther Allison (Himself - Lead Guitar & Vocals)", "James Solberg (Himself - Rhythm & Lead Guitar)", "Mike Vlahakis (Himself - Keyboards)", "Ken Faltinson (Himself - Bass)", "Robb Stupka (Himself - Drums)", "Memphis Horns (Wayne Jackson, Andrew Love) (Themselves)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
