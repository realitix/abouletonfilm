Export demonstrates how the body of the consumer, especially that of the female consumer, is co-opted by commercialism. In tongue-in-cheek fashion, A Perfect Pair celebrates the modern-day co-mingling of fetish objects, as a body builder seduces a prostitute at a bar saying, \u201cYour eyes are the most beautiful blue ad-space. Your cheek could promote a Mercedes. Your neck could be a slogan for styled technology.\u201d Export\u2019s work is centered around the evolving role of women in a culture where images increasingly displace material reality. A Perfect Pair wonderfully illustrates the inescapability of advertising\u2019s \u201cregime of signs\", the signifying network of personal and product values that is effectively encoded on the space of women\u2019s bodies.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jB7sh6RjrTAcTDGT44IV54UkW4C.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
