Franz is happily married and a good family father, Gustav, a relaxed charmer, is living a calm single life. Overnight both of them become jobless, because Panigl decided to sell his Caf\u00e9 which was not successful anymore. Right in this moment, Franz' brother is sending  20.000 Dollar from USA. Money, he once peculated and now wants to pay back.. Gustav and Franz are buying half of the Caf\u00e9 for each from the unexpected money.
