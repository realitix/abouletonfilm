Fahey plays a handsome, athletic businessman who vies for the hand of rancher's daughter Tushika Bergen. Our hero must not only contend with his romantic rival, a dashing but dangerous cattleman, but also with a villainous creditor who craves the land left to Bergen by her late father. By nature of its plotline and setting, Wrangler can't help but invite comparisons to the popular The Man From Snowy River. Still, the stars and director Ian Barry keep up the appearances of freshness and originality", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7U1fsBPdoMQvaMa29yW4HBqcmcK.jpg", "actors": ["Jeff Fahey (Ben Creed)", "Tushka Bergen (Alice May Richards)", "Steven Vidler (Jack Donaghue)", "Richard Moir (Bill Thompson)", "Shane Briant (Allenby)", "Drew Forsythe (Henry Iverson)", "Frederick Parslow (James Richards)", "Sandy Gore (Maude Richards)", "Cornelia Frances  (Caroline Richards)", "Robert Alexander (Officer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "Jd93fcctyjs"}
