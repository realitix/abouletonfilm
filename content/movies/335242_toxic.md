They linger in an environment of glossy remains, of toxic plants and transformed ethnographic and police photography. While the punk gives a speech on toxicity and a performance referencing early feminist art works, the drag queen reenacts an interview of Jean Genet from the \u201880s and blames the filmmakers for exposing her to the police-like scenario of being filmed. The camera turns and depicts the space-off, the space outside the frame.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Ginger Brooks Takashi ()", "Werner Hirsch ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
