The sheer uncertainty about the future pushes folks to cling on to their daily habits while trying to get along with the ever-shifting political landscape. A wide array of wildly diversified characters try to cope as good as they can with the hardships in their town. A death metal band keeps rehearsing daily. A teacher guides visitors through the story of the city. The wonders of a vibrating armchair are tested as a tool against stress and anxiety. An elderly lady who has lost her son tries to talk some sense into her fellow citizens urging them to accept peace.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bR14hAnVp5DKUkCwP1im0NUKFpk.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "vSCAAH2dRPE"}
