Ten years later, Meiselas returns looking for the people who appear in the photographs: where are they now, what do they remember, what do they think of their country and of the revolution? She finds a woman who buried her husband when she was 14; she talks to those who fought the Guarda Nacional - some are disillusioned, some still have the fervor of revolution; she talks to mothers about their sons; she finds a Guarda member who became a Contra. And she offers her own reflections on time and history and on the moment and meaning of a photograph.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mPowrE6BsQdfyiYJQveaXW5JvDs.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
