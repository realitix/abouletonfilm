The plane takes off like a bird by hopping into the sky, then follows along the railroad tracks dodging obstacles and going through the tunnel. A modernized Mount Rushmore includes Franklin W. Roosevelt and Wendell Willkie, the Democratic and Republican Party nominees for president in 1940. In Ireland, a tenor sings until a hair gets stuck in the projector gate. The tenor yells, \"Hey you up there, get that hair out of here!\", and a silhouette hand plucks the hair away. In Africa, an ostrich can't find any of his friends, who all have their heads stuck in the sand.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2SJOm57gdCvcsPIYrnCfvHBSfo3.jpg", "actors": ["Mel Blanc (Native Chief / Translator / Ostrich / Sick Butterfly (voice) (uncredited))", "Robert C.
