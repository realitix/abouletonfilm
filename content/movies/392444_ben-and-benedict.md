Benedict is her imaginary creation: the girl who would respond with strength and mastery to situations she can only submit to. She is married to a cad who says he only married her because she was pregnant, and now he wants his freedom. Her real love is a fellow medical student, who shows some interest in her. Nonetheless, she remains faithful to her unenthusiastic husband, until she becomes pregnant again. At this point, she begins to act more like the Benedict of her dreams and less like the \"Ben\" she has lived as until now.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/imawGWepyQrpbf0WhfFIdYYBzwd.jpg", "actors": ["Fran\u00e7oise Lebrun ()", "Andr\u00e9 Dussollier ()", "Daniel Duval ()", "Jacqueline Staup ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
