Ver\u00f3nica (luminous newcomer Jimena Franco) is driven by a need to help people. When a cab she is riding in hits street kid, Tato, she immediately brings him home and tends to his injuries. Ver\u00f3nica\u2019s roommate Greta thinks Tato is trouble but Ver\u00f3nica only sees someone in need of a hand. Drawing well-earned comparisons to Tangerine, Hold Me Like Before\u2019s minimalist plot is rife with emotion and longing, slowly and quietlyworking its way into your heart, where it will stay.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ArpiELKJJ3h3tWBaanPN5wWDodc.jpg", "actors": ["Jimena Franco ()", "Natalia Porras ()", "Camilo Regueira ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
