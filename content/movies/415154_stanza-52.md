The only person aware of this is Serena, an eccentric fifty-year-old chambermaid who still has a smile on her face despite a difficult life. As she cleans, Serena asks the room about the fate of her deceased husband in the afterlife and the room appears, somewhat confusedly, to answer her. A surreal dialogue ensues, during which Serena talks about her own and other people\u2019s sins, and frankly tackles a fundamental theme of Christian morality.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
