Much slower than anticipated.\r\n\r\nSolid performance by Richie Merritt Jr. however, and Matthew McConaughey fully embraced his character."}, {"pseudo": "Gimly", "content": "Forgettable.\r\n\r\nI guess I theoretically could feel sorry for the actual person this movie was based around? Maybe? But not for this character. Nothing about _White Boy Rick_ grabbed me, least of all the utterly never-congenial Matthew McConaughey, who I seem unable to escape recently, desperate though I am to do so.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Definitely not for me, but I sort of get the appeal._"}], "recommandations_id": [283601, 347375, 475132, 446021]}
