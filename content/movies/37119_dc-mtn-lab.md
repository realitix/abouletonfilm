It is strictly off-limits to the public, though, so few have ever gotten a glimpse beyond the Mtn. Lab gates... until now. Filmed primarily at the Mountain Lab during winter 2005, the Mtn. Lab DVD captures a typical day at the lab with the DC team and friends, and features action footage of the entire DC team.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yGxbzs5EKzrfEUXIiZNIZ494tdE.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
