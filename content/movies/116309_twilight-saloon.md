Uchida employs this concentration of setting and time to fashion a microcosm for a group portrait of Japan. One by one, the regulars of the bar appear: the pianist who dreams of becoming a composer but has disappeared from the music world after a knifing; a stripper who had planned to be a ballet dancer; an elderly painter trying to make a living at pachinko, and who rues his art having been used for militarist propaganda during the war; a young waitress considering elopement; a colonel turned real estate broker who attempts to rouse the crowd in military song until he realizes the tune has been transformed by marchers in the street into a leftist chant. The \"twilight\" is more than just a time of day; here, it is a state of being, a suspension between past and present, between the camaraderie of the saloon and the harsh world outside.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/za3cB2gjJF1Nws0dM7qrEzY2sae.jpg", "actors": ["Daisuke Kat\u00f4 (Kibe)", "Eijir\u014d T\u014dno (Onizuka)", "Keiko Tsushima (Emy Rosa)", "Jun Tatara (Tetsuo Kumishima)", "Tetsur\u014d Tamba (Morimoto)", "Shigeru Amachi ()", "Korema Arima (Kozo Taniguchi)", "Ureo Egawa (Yamaguchi)", "Ichiro Kodama ()", "Isamu Kosugi (Moichiro Umeda)", "Takuya Miyahara (Kenichi Maruyama)", "Akira Nakamura (Taga)", "Hitomi Nozoe (Yuki Noguchi)", "Natsuko Okazaki ()", "Hiroshi Ono (Kinya Eto)", "Minoru Takada (Ryusuke Nakakoji)", "Ken Utsui (Masumi)", "Sakutar\u014d Yamakawa ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
