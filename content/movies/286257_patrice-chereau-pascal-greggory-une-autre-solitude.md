From the first reading around the table through the first contact with the performance space, rehearsals and lighting to opening night, the entire creative process unfurls in front of our eyes. The film shows us the evolving and ongoing dialogue between Greggory and Ch\u00e9reau, a dialogue full of crises and magical moments of harmony and insight via which the truth, intensity, complexity, mystery and depth of Kolt\u00e8s\u2019 text gradually emerge to form an implicit bond between these two men. The film also shows Ch\u00e9reau directing rehearsals for Mozart\u2019s \"Don Giovanni\" in Salzburg, revealing both the unity of and profound differences between his opera and theater work.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hGVPLBqH755GB18bs4f9rM40Yqf.jpg", "actors": ["Patrice Ch\u00e9reau (Himself)", "Pascal Greggory (Himself)", "Bryn Terfel (Himself (Leporello))", "Lella Cuberli (Herself (Donna Anna))", "Catherine Malfitano (Herself (Donna Elvira))", "Daniel Barenboim (Himself (Conductor of 'Don Giovanni'))", "Roberto De Candia (Himself (Leporello))", "Paul Groves (Himself (Don Ottavio))", "Vesselina Kasarova (Herself (Zerlina))", "Matti Salminen (Himself (Commandatore))", "Ferruccio Furlanetto (Himself (Don Giovanni))"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
