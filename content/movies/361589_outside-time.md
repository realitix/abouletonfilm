The film is set in a small town somewhere in Brandenburg, a place which is rapidly falling \"outside time\"; since it cannot keep pace with the changes brought about by unification and the transformation of the former GDR. The Russian troops stationed there have withdrawn and their barracks have turned into rat-infested ruins; the intercity trains do not stop there any more and even the regional railway link to Berlin is going to be suspended. Most young people are leaving. When Sophie introduces her lover to her mother and her brother, Sergej becomes embroiled in the incestuous tensions underlying the relationship between Sophie, her brother, Georg, and her mother. The arrival of the Russian implodes the claustrophobic sham existence that held this dysfunctional family together.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Rosel Zech (Sophies Mutter)", "Julia J\u00e4ger (Sophie)", "Sylvester Groth (Georg)", "Christine Schorn (Frau Plessow)", "Victor Dei\u00df (Polizist)", "Heidemarie Schneider (Kellnerin)", "Michael Schweigh\u00f6fer (Grambke)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
