Starting with music from Chris Isaak's hit single Wicked Game, she adds her own sung and screamed versions of the lyrics, accompanied by effects-manipulated, diaristic video images. The result is an art-world \"cover\" of a popular artifact, with a woman's voice reinterpreting the male original, and a vivid illustration of the consumer's claim to own and interpret media images.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/jhMaYMm1r6MdxizNOUhp0ZTuaDy.jpg", "actors": ["Pipilotti Rist ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
