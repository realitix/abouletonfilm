His wife leaves him to live alone. His son, who is away at school, will not talk to him. He searches for meaning: he seeks the help of a jolly but dismissive physician; he talks to an underworld thug about having his wife murdered; he delves into the life of his driver, the happy-go-lucky Dinu, who has two wives and a mistress, all three of whom love Dinu, all three of whom Dinu cherishes; last, he returns in his mind to the magical possibilities of his childhood, when he could open doors using only a nursery rhyme.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kg7LSX23NSPP8aemqinR59AfJGi.jpg", "actors": ["Subhendu Chatterjee ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
