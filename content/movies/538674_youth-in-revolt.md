Call it a colony. Call it a village. Call it one-world. Mainly call it a futile exercise in changing human nature, mores, culture and attitudes at any altitude. For t'ain't no time before clashing personalities, petty jealousy, violence and---that old demon---love create havoc. And isn't much longer before they become re-united in the face of an avalanche that threatens to destroy them. They all return to whence they came, sadder and wiser.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/56jaHPsCAAnv5sAyyEU9BfH3SID.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
