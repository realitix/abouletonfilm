Police Superintendent Zdychynec from the Prague Liben neighborhood reports the case to Police Councilman Vac\u00e1tko, upon whose order an investigation is launched immediately. Zdychynec begins to suspect the wooer of his own daughter, a handsome dragoon named Rudi, of the crime. In Rudi's absence, Zdychynec searches his rented room in the apartment of the elegant Mrs Dragicov\u00e1. All his findings - among others, sand left on Rudi's jackboots and a decent amount of money in his bedside table - convince the superintendent that he is following the right lead, especially when Rudi refuses to say where he was at the time of the murder.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4ceTJx8ZNzzNfz9FSEfXbCGZoW3.jpg", "actors": ["Jaroslav Marvan (Policejn\u00ed rada Vac\u00e1tko)", "Josef Bl\u00e1ha (Br\u016f\u017eek)", "Josef Vinkl\u00e1\u0159 (Bou\u0161e)", "Vladim\u00edr Men\u0161\u00edk (Komisa\u0159 Zdychynec)", "Josef Abrh\u00e1m (Poru\u010d\u00edk Rudi Mach\u00e1\u010dek)", "Stella Z\u00e1zvorkov\u00e1 (Zdychyncov\u00e1)", "Helga \u010co\u010dkov\u00e1 (Kamila)", "Kv\u011bta Fialov\u00e1 (Dragi\u010dov\u00e1)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [48460, 77595, 58621, 50795], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
