As the wild energy of the scene burned out their adolescent dreams met the realities of adulthood. But the scene had a lasting legacy on their lives - once a B Boy, always a B Boy... and then a tragic event gives them an unexpected chance to recapture the past. Previously unseen archive footage shines the light on a forgotten era in British youth culture in this humorous and poignant character-driven documentary.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bJ8uBITrl7cUiQCgPcVRf5wlsRe.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
