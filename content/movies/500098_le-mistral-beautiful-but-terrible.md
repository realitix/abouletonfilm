There is no use trying to exert control, it only causes the pain/anxiety to linger. It must run its natural course. The Mistral can be beautiful and terrible, if it catches onto you/your soul becomes wrapped in its temper. It dances over the water changing its course to make your light unpredictable, terrible but beautiful ... solo or in tandem. The story is the jazz by which these events take place. To exert any force over the film would not be the story. I am consumed by the flame.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hDi2EzGEojL8YcbWCiHEwCeiTud.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
