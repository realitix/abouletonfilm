Ricky makes the aquaintance of Ralph Bitondo (also played by Joey Lawrence), a pizza delivery boy who looks almost exactly like Ricky -- so much so that the two decide to trade identities for a while. Ricky enjoys being able to live like an average guy for a change, and Ralph gets a kick out of the perks of stardom, but predictably enough they both learn the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. Also known as The Prince and the Pizza Boy, Prince for a Day also stars Richard Belzer and Khrystyne Haje.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/mwrmmAQThbTIBmXCjaun62m47lh.jpg", "actors": ["Joey Lawrence (Ralph Bitondo / Ricky Prince)", "Richard Belzer (Bernie Silver)", "Khrystyne Haje (Nora Flynn)", "Michelle Blakely (Elaine)", "Barry Flatman (Lenny Hollister)", "Lainie Kazan (Rose)", "Tony De Santis (Pascal)", "Andrew Lawrence (Timmy)", "Bruno Gerussi (Guido Bitando)", "Katie Griffin (Gina)", "Rod Wilson (Vinny)", "Nicole Oliver (Marianne)", "Joel Bissonnette (Sal)", "John Wildman (Frankie)", "Barry Moyle (Trucker)", "Bruce Hunter (Louie)", "Mark Wilson (Mookie)", "Tom Melissis (Quentin)", "Daniel DeSanto (Carlo)", "Chris Benson (Sergeant)", "Sandra Caldwell (Officer Florence)", "David Berni (Yuppie)", "Paul James (Blues Singer)", "Ardon Bess (Nix)", "Troy Peery (Engineer)", "Allan Clow (Blues Fan)", "Hugh Dillon ()", "Carson Manning (Roadie)", "Allen Richards (Man in park)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
