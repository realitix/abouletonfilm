Life goes on without major mishaps in a large house surrounded by a beautiful garden. It is a wonderful world, a great bubble of comfort, where different personal spheres coexist: the mother, along with her three children and the Aymara inhabitants of the house. The drama surfaces slowly, without narrative ploys, observing day-to-day activities until internal and external forces make the bubble burst. The film relates the story of the final days of an upper-class family, at a time when the country is undergoing social changes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qGknr9SF3p0aZtEM5BhGiSUMqIU.jpg", "actors": ["Mariana Vargas (Bernarda)", "Nin\u00f3n del Castillo (Carola)", "Pascual Loayza (Wilson)", "Nicol\u00e1s Fern\u00e1ndez (Andr\u00e9s)", "Juan Pablo Koria (Patricio)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
