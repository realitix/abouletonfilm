Rising to the rank of the \"dons\" -- Don Raffaele (Carmine Ippolito) or Don Gennaro (Pasquale Cenammo) -- is not an easy task, as Totonno is about to find out. In the meantime, Paula (Belinda Lee) provides a romantic distraction, and another would-be entrepreneur opts for the straight and narrow. This uneven feature offers some colorful performances but the sum is less convincing than its parts.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dZRWm8wuYGQiwFVOja4YJQlGN5s.jpg", "actors": ["Fernando Rey (Andr\u00e9)", "Teresa Madruga (Eva)", "Mariana Villar (Ana)", "Maria de Medeiros (Ana as a Child)", "Diogo D\u00f3ria (Jorge)", "Artur Semedo (Nunes)", "Simone de Oliveira (Clara)", "Jo\u00e3o C\u00e9sar Monteiro ()", "Pedro Efe ()", "Isabel Alves de Carvalho ()", "Nuno Carinhas (Manuel)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
