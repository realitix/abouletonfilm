He meets a waitress who's also seen her share of trouble and they start up a tenuous relationship. Then there's a murder and things get complicated. It's noir so the plot isn't the main focus but the mood of the film is consistent and properly downbeat. The characters can't seem to shake the fate that hangs over them.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/4IEq0Jt5upOpJ7428id3iOKIQqF.jpg", "actors": ["James Russo (Frank Miles)", "Theresa Russell (Dora Baker)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
