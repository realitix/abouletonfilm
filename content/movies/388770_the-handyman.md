The quiet Armand settles into Montreal after his wife has left him and before long, he continues the momentum when an ill-considered liaison with a nubile woman ends on her insistence. Next, Armand gives his heart to a frustrated housewife, though this decision is hardly well thought out. In the meantime, a gay man who rents out a room in his apartment has unfulfilled longings directed at the unsuspecting handyman. L'Homme a Tout Faire won a Silver Medal for \"Best Picture\" at the 1980 San Sebastian Film Festival.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dLbUJSvF9J8CXaep80L7sToLojM.jpg", "actors": ["Jocelyn B\u00e9rub\u00e9 ()", "Andr\u00e9e Pelletier ()", "Gilles Renaud ()", "Janette Bertrand ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
