At this time the band had only the Initium album out and were in the process of making the Unholy Passion EP (a couple of the songs that would end up on that record were played at this show). The lineup was Glenn Danzig, Steve Zing, Eerie Von and Damien (I believe). The show was 47 minutes in length and featured most of the Initium album, a couple Misfits songs, and the aforementioned tracks from Unholy Passion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/cBQSooj8MPNW2BMf2YWHYfQaAsU.jpg", "actors": ["Glenn Danzig ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
