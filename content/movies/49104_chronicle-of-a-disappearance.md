Among the many unrelated scenes, there is a Palestinian actress struggling to find an apartment in West Jerusalem, the owner of the Holy Land souvenir shop preparing merchandise for incoming Japanese tourists, a group of old women gossiping about their relatives, and an Israeli police van which screeches to a halt so several heavily armed soldiers can get off the car and urinate.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rCQyhWEeeBF2ohQIKiH9wuLrUGF.jpg", "actors": ["Elia Suleiman (Himself)", "Nazira Suleiman (Mother)", "Fuad Suleiman (Father)", "Ali Suliman (The Man)", "Juliet Mazzawi (The aunt)", "Fawaz Eilemi (Abu Adnan)", "Leonid Alexeenko (Priest)", "Iaha Mouhamad (The writer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [129411], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
