Finally, she manages to kill her torturer. Leaving home for the first time of her life, she meets Hideki who struggles with his psychological chaos. He finds her torturing herself because of her trauma, and then he sacrifices himself for his \u201cblood action painting\u201d to share her sorrow and pain.
