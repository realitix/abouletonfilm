Coming from very different worlds, anxiety is the only thing they have in common. One of them is Antonieta Sanchez, a single mother who has made ends meet for herself and her son, Odulio, by washing clothes and ironing. She knows she has lost her son a long time ago: Odulio is a young criminal. The night he was shot, Antonieta's life changed forever. The other is Benigno Robles, an assistant district attorney who, as a young law student, devoted his career with hope and deeply rooted ideals of justice. When Elisa, his only daughter, is hit by a stray bullet, Benigno will never be the same. But this encounter between Antonieta and Benigno, seemingly coincidental, is not: there is a secret that will eventually come to light", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gCAutBr7VOIE2IBHqOKSD3nXyyg.jpg", "actors": ["Daniela Alvarado (Elisa)", "Carlos Cruz (Benigno Robles)", "Elba Escobar (Nora)", "Lourdes Valera (Antonieta S\u00e1nchez)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
