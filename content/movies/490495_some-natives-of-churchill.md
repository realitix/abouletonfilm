It also changed the way of life of the Native Indian and Inuit population. \"Four levels of government,\" says one, \"and the town's biggest industry is the liquor store.\" In this film, local inhabitants say what they think of the changes and why they decided to stay when others moved on.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/by5LLIcD5k2uYQJW1PQTRZ0my8s.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
