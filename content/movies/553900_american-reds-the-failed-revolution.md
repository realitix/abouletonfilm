Since its founding in 1919, the CPUSA has championed the struggles for democracy, labor rights, women\u2019s equality, and racial justice. During its heyday in the 1930s and 1940s, it attracted millions of Americans to support its causes and almost 100,000 men and women to enlist in its ranks. The film begins with the Party's emergence as a small militant sect in the 1920s and documents its rise to the foremost radical group in the United States during the Great Depression, fighting against racism, sexism and fascism, as well as for the rights of workers to organize. It ends with the decline of the Party during the Cold War under the assaults of the FBI and anti- communist crusades.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gZSlqWHuxYF1EY8HeaSyjysxFto.jpg", "actors": ["Wayne June (Narrator)", "Gus Hall (Self/Archive Footage)", "Gil Green (Self)", "Henry Winston (Self)", "Bettina Aptheker (Self)", "Sam Darcy (Self)", "Robert Schrank (Self)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
