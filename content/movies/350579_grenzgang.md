It is really turbulent at this folk festival, when the municipal boundaries are confirmed from old tradition and everything is upside down. For this occasion leaves Thomas Weidmann his girlfriend and flees because of his botched university career from the city of Berlin back to his native village. At the party, he meets Kerstin Werner, whose life has just come out of joint - her marriage is broken and her husband J\u00fcrgen on the jump to another, younger woman.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yNPRqfPlpf0kQupm2MVFgFaIlGV.jpg", "actors": ["Claudia Michelsen (Kerstin Werner)", "Lars Eidinger (Thomas Weidmann)", "Gesine Cukrowski (Claudia Preiss)", "Gertrud Roll (Liese Werner)", "Sandro Lohmann (Daniel mit 16)", "Harald Schrott (J\u00fcrgen Bamberger)", "Margarita Broich (Swingerclub-Besitzerin)", "Melika Foroutan (Konstanze)", "Hanns Zischler (Rektor Granitzny)", "Michael Benthin (Arzt)", "Nora Jokhosha (Andrea Bamberger)", "Renate Becker (Tante Anni)", "Reiner Wagner (B\u00fcrgermeister)", "Christoph Zrenner (Gerd)", "Bennet Meyer (Daniel mit 9)", "Fred Aaron Blake (Spanner)", "Volker Dieter Frank (Swinger)", "Daniel Radtke (Swinger)", "Yvo Ren\u00e9 Scharf (Swinger)", "Martin Thon (Swinger)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
