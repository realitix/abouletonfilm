The film opens with the sextet humiliating a respected painter's portraits of them, driving the man to a sus\u00adpicious suicide. Later, while celebrating his son's impending marriage into a wealthy family, Ibaragiya releases six pigeons from a pleasure boat, each with a rolled up drawing of one of the beauties tied to their legs. He offers a cash reward to whomever recovers the pictures, but they instead become death notices of which of the six are next to die.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yKq7MBDmMKniI7NX1ItFbFNxjpV.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
