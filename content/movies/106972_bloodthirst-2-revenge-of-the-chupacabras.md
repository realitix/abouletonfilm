The inmate, Charles Parker, has been telling the strange story of a vicious vampire-like beast called the Chupacabras that he claims he trapped in a nearby mine and destroyed after it had savagely killed a number of the local citizenry. Among the missing: a girl who matches the description of the college co-ed. Before Andrews can talk to him, however, the inmate escapes leading the Detective into a maze of horror and the realization that he must find the missing girl before time runs out.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/y51ZfpP3OfF5ZY02n74mCM1HRjI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
