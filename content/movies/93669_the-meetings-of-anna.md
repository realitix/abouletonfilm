In each place she either already has some intimate connection, or readily makes one. People seem drawn to her, but inevitably insist on sharing their inmost secrets and discontents with her, despite her obvious and profound lack of interest in these revelations. This does not deter Anna from continuing to meet people, and she genuinely connects with them occasionally, as when she sees her mother briefly in Brussels.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lUBd7gMLBYMoNKUMZMEcLYsw4ds.jpg", "actors": ["Aurore Cl\u00e9ment (Anna Silver)", "Helmut Griem (Heinrich Schneider)", "Magali No\u00ebl (Ida)", "Hanns Zischler (Hans)", "Jean-Pierre Cassel (Daniel)", "Lea Massari (Anna mother)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [24588, 46210, 104739], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
