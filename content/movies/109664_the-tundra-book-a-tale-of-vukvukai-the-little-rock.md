He is an old man full of energy and wisdom - the 'real man of the tundra' whose life can not be seen apart from by the deer. His people take care of a huge herd - over 14,000 deer. Their life is a non-stop struggle for survival and well-being in the most harsh weather conditions of Chaun-Chukotka. They deeply believe in the strength of tradition and so succeed in their struggle. The ancient culture of Nomadic Chukchi takes care of them, so they preserve and follow it. As far as it is now - their realm remains stable.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/sIh6yFMOIJp4VnSaac9GglmUaK9.jpg", "actors": ["Vladislav Nuvano (Consultant and Chukchi / Russian Translator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "EpQjoFWsoKY"}
