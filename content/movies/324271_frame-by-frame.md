After the regime fell from power in 2001, a fledgling free press emerged and a photography revolution was born. Now, as foreign troops and media withdraw, Afghanistan is left to stand on its own and so are its journalists. Set in a modern Afghanistan bursting with color and character, FRAME BY FRAME follows four Afghan photojournalists navigating a dangerous media landscape as they reframe Afghanistan for the world, and for themselves. Through cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9, powerful photojournalism, and never-before-seen footage shot in secret during the Taliban regime, the film connects an audience with four humans in the pursuit of the truth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oEVZZEc155HYgCDgMt92gNK3nue.jpg", "actors": ["Massoud Hossaini (Himself)", "Wakil Kohsar (Himself)", "Najibullah Mosafer (Himself)", "Farzana Wahidy (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "w6dkvb4_ZlQ"}
