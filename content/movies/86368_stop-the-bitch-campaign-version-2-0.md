Kuni (Kenichi Endo) runs a Phone Sex service, where middle-aged men talk too,  and arrange to meet, schoolgirls for \u201cCompensated Dating\u201d (enjo kosai) \u2013 the men provide gifts in return for \u201cdating\u201d the schoolgirl (although no money changes hands, this is effectively teenage prostitution). Kuni discovers that one group of schoolgirls are using his service to ambush (and then blackmail) his clients and decides to embark on a moral crusade against them (hence the title, Stop the Bitch\u2026). Unfortunately, this crusade takes the form of arranging to meet the schoolgirls, having (kinky and degrading) sex with them and then running off without paying. The logic goes that if these girls are not making money from their \u201cdating\u201d, they will give it up, making the world a safer place for everyone.  Unfortunately for Kuni, these schoolgirls decide to fight back\u2026.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/hbEelQAofRX4HqfV54HEdx4YUVc.jpg", "actors": ["Tina Yuzuki ()", "Mayu Sugano ()", "Emi Hirai ()", "Yui Nakanose ()", "Sachiko Kurosawa ()", "Chinatsu Kido ()", "Ky\u00f4nosuke Hanai ()", "Goro Kataoka (Goro Kataoka)", "Goro Kataoka ()", "Takeshi Oonishi (Takeshi Oonishi)", "Takeshi Oonishi ()", "Ken'ichi End\u00f4 ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
