We encounter a dentist and writer, a tired ex-boxer who had a carrier in Germany, a hardcore punk band Pas Maters, whose charismatic front man and lead singer mysteriously disappeared, an old soccer supporter with the last name Hajduk, an ex-hooligan diligently studying in a night school and many others. A complex portrait of an unusual Split neighbourhood and its even more unusual inhabitants with Hajduk as their religion.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6WKEpBND8J6sZNMEetXnWF8eI4K.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
