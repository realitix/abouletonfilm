Matthias (Matthias Eysen) is already a misfit and has trouble meeting society's expectations. When he is picked up by the police for a minor crime, the brutal indifference with which he is treated wounds him in ways which are not healed by his being found innocent and being released.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rm2rXrKnHOSqQ7IvHwDvwkKgxs9.jpg", "actors": ["Walter Sedlmayr ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
