It covers his personal journey discovering his roots. Reliving old habits with friends and memories from his childhood, this journey leads him to re-visit his past with his ex-girlfriend, and then with a new friend, Anna, through whom he visits his old home in Gozo, now a neglected house full of memories. Anna is his springboard for self reflection and becomes his reason for trying to start life again in Malta; a place he\u2019s familiar with but is now seeing through different eyes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/gJrGvlHiGHuiLTbQaRFjlI5GEos.jpg", "actors": ["Karl Consiglio (Karl)", "Annabelle Galea (Ana)", "Marieclaire Camilleri (Marie)", "Annabelle Galea (Anna)", "Andrie Rizzo (Mike)", "Marie Louise Vella (Lisa)", "Christopher Galea (Paul)", "Gregory Sammut (Luke)", "Marta Verdugo Pastor (Marta)", "Fenna Lampe (Katya)", "Joanna Bonnici (Joanna)", "Beppe Abela (Bullu)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
