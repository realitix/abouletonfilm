His only pleasure, it seems, is in making and controlling puppets. Thanks to his skill, he is offered a job as a lab assistant to Dr. Walker, who is working on ways to re-animate dead bodies by inserting electrodes at key nerve points and manipulating the bodies as if they were on strings. When the professor suddenly dies one night, Shanks gets the idea to apply their experimental results to a human body, and then to start exacting some revenge.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fHybjn8BJRzWdg94INCPJ5ZTbuq.jpg", "actors": ["Marcel Marceau (Malcolm Shanks / Old Walker)", "Tsilla Chelton (Mrs. Barton)", "Philippe Clay (Mr. Barton)", "Cindy Eilbacher (Celia)", "Biff Manard (Goliath)", "Helena Kallianiotes (Mata Hari)", "Larry Bishop (Napoleon)", "Don Calfa (Einstein)", "Phil Adams (Beethoven)", "Read Morgan (Cop)", "William Castle (Grocer)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [30048, 28298], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
