The Israelites are engaged in a bloody battle against the Philistines, and Samson is the influential judge and powerful warrior who has given the war-weary Israelites a newfound sense of hope. That hope is soon diminished, however, when the irresistible Delilah ensnares the long haired Samson in a hopeless web of passion. Samson draws power from his flowing locks, and without them he is but a mortal man. The only way to defeat Samson is to shear his formidable mane, and the temptress Delilah is the only one capable of getting close enough to do so.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Charles Alvez da Cruz ()", "Klara Uleman ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
