No matter who the crowd, best friends Noah, New Michael, Jack and Ethan have one simple mantra: \u201cWe would much rather the audience appreciate us as comedians than people who have overcome adversity.\u201d  In this coming-of-age heartfelt documentary, this band of brothers finds themselves at a crossroad. With real life pulling them apart, they decide to plan one ambitious farewell show before they all go their separate ways. People with Asperger\u2019s don\u2019t deal well with uncertainty, and this is the most uncertain time in their lives.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/kpKgzxjyNmLOgVNB0Z1l2n3tGhV.jpg", "actors": ["Noah Britton ()", "Ethan Finlan ()", "Jack Hanke ()", "New Michael Ingemi ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [253265, 3149, 3210, 84372], "youtube_key": "bnbjwmLMuJY"}
