Arriving on the scene from a background of aerospace engineering, Matra brought a host of innovative technologies to bear, and an entirely different approach from the largely British-based \u2018Garagistes\u2019 then dominating the F1 landscape. As Matra Racing shows, the French firm even left F1 grandees Ferrari scratching their heads as Matra pioneered the use of Computer Aided Design, true monocoque construction from space-ace materials, and a rigorous design and testing programme. It wasn\u2019t just in Formula One where they met with success; between 1972 and \u201974 they ruled the sportscar prototype roads, particularly at Le Mans in the hands of Henri Pescarolo. This new film profiles meteoric rise, and equally rapid disappearance of the French blue cars in the late 1960s and early 1970s, speaking to many of the key players in the firm as well as the drivers.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/yPxXtFpKk7CXzmsELuL9EoIwqFt.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
