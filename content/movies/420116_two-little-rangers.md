He is about to start on some expedition of crime and his wife implores him to stay at home. She receives a beating for her trouble. Jim, a cowboy, rides past the shack, hears Mrs. Gray's screams and interferes, and takes Mrs. Gray over to his friend, the postmaster, so that she may have a good home. \"Wild Bill\" plans vengeance. Paxton, the postmaster, starts for the station with money and gold, and is accompanied a short way by Jim. Gray sneaks after them. After going with Paxton a short distance, Jim takes a turn in the road and Paxton rides on alone. Gray closes up on the postmaster, gets the drop on him, but Paxton is quick and there's a hand-to-hand struggle. Bill, however, worsts Paxton, and finally sends him over a precipice. But in falling, Paxton falls into a tree and thus is saved from sure death.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/m0nzgj6BFgNL3e52eGrPvE3Mmkl.jpg", "actors": ["Vinnie Burns ()", "Blanche Cornwall ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
