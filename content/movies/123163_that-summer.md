It also notched him his first major award nomination, in the BAFTAs' now-defunct category 'Most Promising Newcomer to a Leading Film Role'. (He was one of two \"losers\", the other being a Sigourney Weaver for Alien!)  The Torquay-set Last Summer follows a pair of northern lasses who travel south to work as hotel chambermaids - where they meet rough-diamond Steve and enjoy various scrapes and adventures as he prepares for an around-the-bay swimming contest.
