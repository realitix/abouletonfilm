Facing the pressure all around him, the filmmaker tries to find a way to feel complete without having to explain. Alongside the personal dilemma is his singular family-his brother, sister and their grand childless parents, who are longing for continuity. Like the men he talks to confidentially, they present him with the main conflict in his live. As the inevitable crisis looms, a new factor emerges and illuminates things in a new light.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vBMbowLFYmQjj0mwkxl2EJ0kBgI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
