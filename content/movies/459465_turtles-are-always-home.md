For the past 10 years I lived in 7 countries, 10 cities, and 21 homes. I slept in 21 beds, cooked in 21 kitchens, cleaned 21 bathrooms, stared at 21 windows, wrote on 21 desks, and locked 21 doors behind me. I packed all of my life into two suitcases and a backpack. The rest stayed behind.  Somebody somewhere uses my bed, somebody somewhere has my shoes. I was there. But now I am here.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/rdyyx8Qq6CjfAPIdRCmnskOcWNH.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "91RA42hMeaw"}
