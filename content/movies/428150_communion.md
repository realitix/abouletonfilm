{"tmdb_id": 428150, "title": "Communion", "original_title": "Komunia", "slug_title": "communion", "date": "2016-11-25", "genre": ["Documentaire"], "score": "8.0/10", "synopsis": "When adults are ineffectual, children have to grow up quickly. Ola is 14 and she takes care of her dysfunctional father, autistic brother and a mother who lives separately; but most of all she tries to reunite the family. She lives in the hope of bringing her mother back home. Her 13 year old brother Nikodem's Holy Communion is a pretext for the family to meet up. Ola is entirely responsible for preparing the perfect family celebration. \"Communion\" reveals the beauty of the rejected, the strength of the weak and the need for change when change seems impossible. This crash course in growing up teaches us that no failure is final. Especially when love is in question.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/460P8TDtej2ONctjxqSrA4mIfoR.jpg", "actors": ["Ola Kaczanowska (Herself)", "Nikodem Kaczanowski (Himself)", "Marek Kaczanowski (Himself)", "Magdalena Kaczanowska (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
