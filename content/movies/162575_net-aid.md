Concerts took place at Wembley Stadium in London, Giants Stadium in New Jersey and the Palais des Nations in Geneva. The Wembley show was at capacity; the U.S. show suffered from very poor ticket sales. The concert was considered a flop by many observers, failing to raise nearly as much cash as Live Aid.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6M2bk30Xh0gD4nqveatEim44Ho2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
