Between these two elements, which are often repeated, a story like an abyss is built, in which information is progressively reduced. The words become music, the music becomes a rustle, the rustle turns into silence.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2d8bQCJI0whuXroybRfwDELgVzs.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
