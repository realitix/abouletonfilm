Competitors from over 30 different nations come for the experience of a lifetime and to say they have competed in this race. The Romanian countryside offers endless trails in the high mountains, valleys and city passages during this five day event. While the terrain is beautiful and majestic, it is challenging in every aspect. If you finish red Bull Romaniacs, you can finish anything.  This year, New Zealand\u2019s Extreme Enduro star Chris Birch goes for his second win in a row. However, former champions Andreas Lettenbichler of Germany and the UK\u2019s Graham Jarvis are hungry to steal the show. But lurking in the shadows are Paul Bolton of the UK and Spain\u2019s Xavi Galindo who are both seeking their first win at Romaniacs.
