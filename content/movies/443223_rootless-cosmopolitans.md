Alienated from themselves and wondering why 'it isn't exactly trendy to be Jewish', Estelle and Lily meet each other and explore their Jewishness.  They explore the stories of a mother and daughter in fifties Britain, a refugee from Vienna, and Israeli Iranian storyteller, a neurotic father, a Trinidadian woman, and finally the two women end up on a roof looking at Israel.  Rootless Cosmopolitans mixes music, family and food to take a wry look at the myth of the Jewish princess and asks 'What is a Jew?'", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
