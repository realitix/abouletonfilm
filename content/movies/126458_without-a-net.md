Their families are struggling, their homes are physically unstable and everyone they know has dropped out of school. When a big-top circus tent suddenly appears in a nearby parking lot, they decide to take a chance. They learn trapeze, acrobatics, juggling and contortion, then audition for the end-of-year show, rehearse and prepare for the curtains to part on opening night. Along the way, WITHOUT A NET explores the connections between risk, desire, poverty and circus, and celebrates the perseverance of youth in the face of tremendous odds.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/oxlCBcCiafL1SChzXbx4VlzQRQQ.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
