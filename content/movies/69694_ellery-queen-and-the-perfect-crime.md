The principal villain is crooked stockbroker John Mathews (Douglass Dumbrille), whose Wall Street manipulations render Ray Jarden (H. B. Warner) penniless. Mathews' chicanery seems particularly coldblooded, inasmuch as his daughter Marian (Linda Hayes) is engaged to Jarden's son Walter (John Beal). When the latter disappears, Mathews asks Ellery Queen to locate the young man.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7ZqPhD74m5dAATh68Wwarte2gKG.jpg", "actors": ["Ralph Bellamy (Ellery Queen)", "Margaret Lindsay (Nikki Porter)", "Charley Grapewin (Insp.
