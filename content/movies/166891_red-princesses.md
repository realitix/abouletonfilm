Eleven-year-old Claudia and her younger sister experience the street fighting at first hand outside their car window. Their parents are Sandinista activists and, although the family is now escaping to neighbouring Costa Rica, the struggle continues. Their parents fire off terse commands and the girls are packed off to their relatives. The film focuses on the point of view of the two sisters, who are very close, as they learn more than they are able to cope with, but too little really to understand. A revolutionary struggle, seen through the eyes of children.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uPFbxhPewxCu88ItLRoqCzAHQr3.jpg", "actors": ["Valeria Conejo (Claudia)", "Aura Dinarte (Antonia)", "Fernando Bola\u00f1os (Felipe)", "Carol Sanabria (Magda)", "Ivette Guier (Cora)", "Patricia Vel\u00e1squez (Ana)", "\u00c1lvaro Marenco (Diego)", "Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Callejas (Floria)", "Mar\u00eda Marta L\u00f3pez (Profesora M\u00fasica)", "Mar\u00eda Luisa Garita (Maestra)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
