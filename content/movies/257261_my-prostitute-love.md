Poetically written and carefully crafted in cinematography, it juxtaposes the realist imagery of the 60s\u2019 diverse interiors and landscape with the mystical moments of love between a greengrocer and an escort, Halil and Sabiha, that come to life with the impressive performances of T\u00fcrkan \u015eoray and \u0130zzet G\u00fcnay. Still remembered with its memorable dialogues and an insightful use of music, My Prostitute Love presents an oscillation between desire and withdrawal, and a long lasting doubt that pervades the story throughout; yet, it eventually succeeds in creating a rupture in the traditional moralist approach.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qYfwYzG5kSlEq6oY9iAg0pBaprY.jpg", "actors": ["T\u00fcrkan \u015eoray (Sabiha)", "\u0130zzet G\u00fcnay (Halil)", "Ayfer Feray (M\u00fcjgan)", "Semih Sezerli (Fethi)", "Aydemir Akba\u015f (Cemil)", "Hakk\u0131 K\u0131van\u00e7 (Halil'in Arkadasi)", "Beh\u00e7et Nacar (Necmi)", "Hakk\u0131 Haktan (Garson Tahsin)", "Selahattin I\u00e7sel (Halil'in Babasi)", "Zeki Sezer (Saz Salonu Patronu)", "Ya\u015far \u015eener (\u00c7i\u00e7ek\u00e7i)", "Aynur Akarsu ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [74304, 265458, 141216, 300207], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
