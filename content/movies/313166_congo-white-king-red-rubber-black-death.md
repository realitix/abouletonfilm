Under his control, Congo became a gulag labour camp of shocking brutality. Leopold posed as the protector of Africans fleeing Arab slave-traders but, in reality, he carved out an empire based on terror to harvest rubber.  From the mid-1880s and lasting for nearly 40 years, an estimated 10 million Congolese were killed under Leopold's reign. The madness only came to an end thanks to the efforts of British journalist and humanitarian E.D. Morel, who exposed the human rights abuses in Congo and published photographs of the mutilated Congolese.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/my2xbgjDwzJB0UTUovDc03NDhdH.jpg", "actors": ["Nick Fraser (Narrator (voice))", "Elie Lison ()", "Roger May ()", "Steve Driesen ()", "Tshilombo Imhotep ()", "Annette Kelly ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
