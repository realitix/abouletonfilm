{"tmdb_id": 424271, "title": "Mozart: Don Giovanni", "original_title": "Mozart: Don Giovanni", "slug_title": "mozart-don-giovanni", "date": "2010-11-03", "genre": [""], "score": "0.0/10", "synopsis": "More than two centuries after its creation, the emotional pull of this supreme opera remains absolutely intact. Dmitri Tcherniakov duly revisits the myth and makes the seducer of Seville a \u2018man without qualities\u2019, a cipher whose words have a hypnotic power over women. His words will disrupt the proprieties ruling the Commandatore\u2019s family. His words are also what makes Don Juan such a subversive figure and the embodiment of one of the most powerful modern European myths. Leading the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra is one of the best Mozart conductors, Louis Langr\u00e9e. Bo Skovhus portrays a dispirited Don Giovanni, old playboy and anti-hero. Kyle Ketelsen is his servant Leporello, currently a shoe-in for this r\u00f4le. The superb female trio is composed of Marlis Petersen (Donna Anna), Kristine Opolais (Elvira) and Kerstin Avemo (Zerlina).", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bHX3dmbraPhJp1kj1SU0Ai9XKpO.jpg", "actors": ["Bo Skovhus (Don Giovanni)", "Kyle Ketelsen (Leporello)", "Marlis Petersen (Donna Anna)", "Kristine Opolais (Donna Elvira)", "Colin Balzer (Don Ottavio)", "Kerstin Avemo (Zerlina)", "David Bizic (Masetto)", "Anatoli Kotscherga (Il Commandatore)", "Louis Langr\u00e9e (Conductor)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
