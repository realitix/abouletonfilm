Share the fun as Doc teaches the toys to patch themselves up when they're down, and shows them how visiting the dentist, seeing an optometrist and even getting an X-ray can work wonders! Banish the blurries as you help Professor Hootsburgh choose the perfect pair of glasses, get soccer star Johnny Foosball back in the game, and fix a friendly bath-time shark's cracked tooth. Then, when Doc sprains her ankle, join the toys as they rush to her rescue. But don't worry -- with rest, patience, and plenty of cuddles, she's back on her feet before you can say, \"The Doc is in!\"", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/6HnFidVKHwUbIm0gl4b1OJcIMcg.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
