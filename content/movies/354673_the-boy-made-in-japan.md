Now unemployed, Yamato lives in a very humble apartment room. He lost his family by the crime he committed with the urge he himself couldn\u2019t and even now can explain. He has nowhere to go, and becomes isolated in the big city. His continuous job search is unsuccessful, and one day he meets a young girl Kaoru who is passing out advertisement packaged with free tissue to the crowd at a train station. He aggressively gets involved with her. The two immediately feel the mutual isolation and desperation within themselves. These are youngsters with no purpose in their lives, symbolizing the Japanese society which passed the post-war economic peak period. Yamato and Kaoru go down the road of destruction, being sucked into the deep, dark ditch of society. Filling the screen images both stark and surreal, director Ataru Oikawa draws an unadulterated portrait of youth.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/q4Ch0ImeB68c3yTR9IgJ1U0Lhns.jpg", "actors": ["Mikio Ohsawa (Yamato Tanaka)", "Kaori Shimada (Kaoru)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
