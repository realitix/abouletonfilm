But I don\u2019t want to think about it, \u2018cause I had a good time and that\u2019s how I choose to remember it.\r\n\r\nTo Hell with what so-called \u201cprofessional\u201d critics are saying, _22 Jump Street_ is not dumb. It\u2019s actually pretty bloody smart. It\u2019s not particularly deep. Or thought-provoking. Or fresh. Or original. Or mature. Or cultured. Or subtle\u2026 But it is smart! And funny. Which for a comedy is more important than anything else.\r\n\r\n_22 Jump Street_ is very aware of itself, and that can be a tough line to walk, but I think it just managed to get right, brining in some serious meta-humour rather than coming across as arrogant or lazy.\r\n\r\nJust.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not particularly big on comedies, and American comedies are certainly pretty low even on that list. But I have been known to come across the odd pleasant surprise. _21 Jump Street_ was one of them (especially considering I assumed it would be akin to the original series, which was a straight laced procedural crime drama\u2026) and now 22 Jump Street is another I can add to that list.\r\n\r\n_75%_\r\n\r\n_-Gimly_"}], "recommandations_id": [64688, 195589, 109414, 228967], "youtube_key": "i3_gKCX4Cik"}
