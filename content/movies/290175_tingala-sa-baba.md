One is a rather hefty child from a well-to-do family who is stuck at the bottom, whereas a lanky child brought up in poverty is on top. Rich kid is looking up to the poor boy, who in turn, is looking down on him. How will the rich kid reverse their positions? The answer to that question will make one realize that friendship is more valuable than money, while the other will discover his true worth as a friend.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lAUfwLyOOs404IX2Zm6CbwBlVgf.jpg", "actors": ["Arvy Cesar Viduya (Angelo)", "Eubert dela Cruz (Renzo)", "Aya Bundang (Cheska)", "Gogo Buencaminio (Security Guard)", "Jenny Fajardo (Mother)", "Mona Singson (Nanny)", "Ralzton Tayco (Nestl\u00e9 vendor)", "Joel Dela Cruz (The Funeral Agent)", "Raul Hababag (Driver)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
