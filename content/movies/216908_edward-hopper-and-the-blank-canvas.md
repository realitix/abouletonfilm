His unclassifiable figurations weave a dialogue between appearances and light, between the unmistakeable and enigma.  Focusing on the artist's personal life in the context of 20th century America, \"Edward Hopper and the Blank Canvas\" bears witness to a fiercely independent painter, who was aware of the issues of his era, and who was hostile to the imprisonment that a modern American art opposing realism and abstraction could lead him to.  This film brings the artist to life, transposing his realist and metaphysical poetry. It is a subtile and passionate work, which at last unveils one of the most important painters of American modernity.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/7zJxG1X07HMUB6kq0qYQ5oPz7MI.jpg", "actors": ["Wim Wenders ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
