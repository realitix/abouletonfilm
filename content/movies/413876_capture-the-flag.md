Teen-age Annie and her father Luke are about to gather with friends for an annual game of Capture the Flag. This year, a lot more is at stake than the white T-shirt standing in for the flag. Annie's parents are on the verge of divorce, and this is the first time she and her father are participating without Annie's mother. What starts as a joyous reunion soon breaks down as friendships among the adults fracture and new allegiances among the children are formed. Over the course of this weekend, Annie learns that even though some things change, the most important relationships will somehow endure.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bGBmEZO4EV0TcJ5B31D7BhuudXm.jpg", "actors": ["Jane Stiles (Annie Edwards)", "Scott Cohen (Luke Edwards)", "Will Denton (Justin Mason)", "Emmy Clarke (Liz Shanlick)", "Kevin Black (Peter Shanlick)", "Gretchen Egolf (Elise)", "Lola Kirke (Tessa Shanlick)", "Rebecca Chace (Janis Mason-Shanlick)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
