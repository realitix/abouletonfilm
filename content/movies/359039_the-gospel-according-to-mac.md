But few know the depths of both faiths as well as Bill McCartney, the former head football coach of the University of Colorado and the founder of Promise Keepers, a Christian men\u2019s ministry.  \u201cThe Gospel According to Mac\u201d tells the truth-is-stranger-than-fiction story of Coach Mac\u2019s controversial national championship run \u2013 two seasons that followed multiple arrests and strife between his mostly African-American players and the Boulder police, continued with McCartney\u2019s own daughter becoming pregnant by the team\u2019s quarterback before seeing that same quarterback struck by cancer, and culminated in consecutive Orange Bowl match-ups against Notre Dame.  Bill McCartney\u2019s passionate and often polarizing beliefs have made him many enemies and many admirers, but it\u2019s difficult to deny that he embodies the essential issues facing football in America to this day.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xkZxXRHNebYyTFJTqT9u5Hhkxro.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
