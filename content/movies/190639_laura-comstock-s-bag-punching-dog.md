He has been trained to perform all sorts of tricks, and his intelligence is, perhaps, most marked in his latest and most difficult feat, that of punching the bag. This picture depicts him in a bag punching performance which is really wonderful. His high jumps and lightning-like punches are remarkable and cause one to marvel at the amount of patience that must be necessary to teach a dog such tricks.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/fP6EZAuAyQjKa5nEpcSgK9ufH6c.jpg", "actors": ["Laura Comstock (Herself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
