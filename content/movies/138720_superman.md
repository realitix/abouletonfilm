The hero, Raja, witnesses the murder of his parents by cowboys. He vows revenge, and spends the rest of the 2 hours and 15 minutes of the flick getting his revenge. Throw in some dance numbers, bad hairdos, outrageous acting, and you have yourself a classic of Indian Cinema few have ever seen. The actor who plays Superman, Rama Rao Taraka Nandamuri, looks like a fat Elvis impersonator.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/eUAHQ4xmmLxMyJONVQg9VKvoNtr.jpg", "actors": ["Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao (Superman / Raja)", "Jayaprada (Jaya)", "Jayamalini (Miss Lee)", "Kaikala Satyanarayana (Dharma Rao)", "Pandari Bai ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [251519, 46146, 1924], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
