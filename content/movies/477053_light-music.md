Formed from two projections facing one another on opposite screens, Light Music is Rhodes\u2019 response to what she perceived as the lack of attention paid to women composers in European music. She composed a \u2018score\u2019 comprised of drawings that form abstract patterns of black and white lines onscreen. The drawings are printed onto the optical edge of the filmstrip.
