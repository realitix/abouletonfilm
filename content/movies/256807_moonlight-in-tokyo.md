Abandoned by his family on a trip to Tokyo with only a few notes in his pocket, he thinks he has found his guardian angel when he bumps into a former classmate, Hoi (Chapman To). But Hoi is no angel at all. He is just a grifter on the run from yakuza loan sharks. When Yan (Yang Kuei-mei), the owner of an escort service, is convinced the ingenuous Jun will mark a perfect gigolo, Hoi decides to transform his pal into Tokyo's most sought-after Lothario in order to eke out a living and to pay his debts.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/xstDDGToy5sHQj2ec6vHqfBB3dg.jpg", "actors": ["Leon Lai (Jun)", "Chapman To (Hoi)", "Michelle Yip Suen (Lu)", "Yang Kuei-Mei (Yan)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
