Mullins's music owes much to '70s pop, equal parts Cat Stevens, Billy Joel, Todd Rundgren, Bruce Springsteen and Kenny Loggins, accentuated by lyrics both intricate and startlingly simple, sometimes incisive and often possessed of a rapier wit often absent in the genre.It is particularly in the live tracks where one is treated to a truly engaging personality.  Mullins's wide-eyed passion is both simple and earnest and glows endearingly through his intelligent songs. HERE IN AMERICA offers a nice introduction to the late Christian singer.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ob6I1DQCuuSUIPES2IRoka8BfpJ.jpg", "actors": ["Rich Mullins (Himself)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
