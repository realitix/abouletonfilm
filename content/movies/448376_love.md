Through this process Moffatt unites the graphic punch and suggestiveness of the still image with the satisfaction of a complete movie narrative. In the end, its only a movie.  \u2018Love\u2019 embodies Moffatt\u2019s desire to create work that has an \u2018international look\u2019 and deal with \u2018universal predicaments\u2019. 'Love' is both parody and pastiche, critical comment, and wryly humorous.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/uzhch7bmKJYsOL4dUUWZGgk6BtI.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
