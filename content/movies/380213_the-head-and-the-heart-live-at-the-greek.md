The band played crowd favorites off their two albums, The Head and the Heart and Let\u2019s Be Still, opening with \u201cCats and Dogs\u201d to roaring applause. Right from the opening notes of the first song, the audience was hooked, singing along with the band and with each other. The enthusiasm carried over into \u201cSounds Like Hallelujah,\u201d \u201cShake,\u201d and \u201cLost In My Mind,\u201d while the whole crowd sang along to the heartfelt \u201cRivers and Roads\u201d. As the evening concluded with \u201cDown in the Valley,\u201d the audience was embracing each other in arms, swaying back and forth. The nearly full moon shone bright on the crowd, and all was well at The Greek.
