They\u2019ll talk, she\u2019ll cook him dinner and then\u2026 who knows? Upon his arrival, he\u2019s taken aback by Ginger\u2019s eccentric charm and beauty. Mark senses that anything is possible tonight. Unfortunately for them both, that is indeed the case. Anything can happen. Everyone has a past, but Ginger\u2019s is more unusual than most. Ferocious paranormal horrors begin to erupt across the house, invading physical space and physical bodies alike until confusion and terror reign supreme. Multiple calls to the police result in absolutely nothing... Over the course of a single night, Mark and Ginger will be tested in ways they\u2019ve never imagined. Their only hope is to try to make it to sunrise \u2014 in some way, shape or form.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/vPaC0WuyGZN1HZ77t4nMvOoFJ27.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
