To try to keep him under his thumb, Abbott convinces Costello that he's a crackerjack salesman. This comedy is somewhat like \"The Time of Their Lives,\" in that Abbott and Costello don't have much screen time together and there are very few vaudeville bits woven into the plot.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/dn4k8bkBUjkv8ByLNJC9rg4nmru.jpg", "actors": ["Bud Abbott (Eddie L.
