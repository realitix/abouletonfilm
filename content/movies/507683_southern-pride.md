Headstrong bar owner Lynn Koval, alongside a team of friends (and her own Republican-voting sister), endeavour against all odds to organise a Pride march in her local town. Meanwhile, in another part of the state, organisers of a Black Pride celebration are simultaneously striving to make a difference, despite the numerous setbacks that stand in their way. Emotionally textured and politically prescient, this inspiring tale of triumph over adversity addresses themes of leadership, struggle, division, community and race relations, ultimately offering a sense of hope in a world that can too often appear so hopeless.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/5k0ctcZHzq5uRBtoqwGAQ1XOgM2.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
