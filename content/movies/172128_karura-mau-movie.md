Shii-chan is the more serious while Mai-chan is more fun-loving. In reality, the two sisters are powerful exorcists from the Karura temple. Each wields half the power... Shii-chan can see the spirits, and Mai-chan can banish them. This is a spooky series with heavy emphasis on traditionally Japanese occult themes.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lTeBsO5I516n42YQ0AQz8EH4w4n.jpg", "actors": ["Hiromi Tsuru ()", "Yuriko Yamamoto ()", "Kaneto Shiozawa ()", "Keiichi Nanba ()", "Masashi Hironaka ()", "Hisako Kyouda ()", "Yuusaku Yara ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
