An off-screen narrator takes us back to the earliest days of film: clips remind us of early stars and blockbusters. He explains how sound came to motion pictures: we see Jolson singing \"Mammy\" and John Barrymore playing Richard III. Next is a salute to the 30,000 people working in Hollywood at 272 different crafts. A montage shows us some of those jobs. It ends with a look at the physical production of celluloid (cotton and silver) and the many aspects of movie making. The narrator promises more short films about each step in production.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": ["Warner Anderson (Narrator)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
