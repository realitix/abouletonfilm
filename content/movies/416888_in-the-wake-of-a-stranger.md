After a bookie is murdered, the sailor is caught in an ever-tightening vice that would trap him as the killer unless he can clear himself. Along the way to struggling free and tracking down the real culprits, several unsavory characters cross his path as well as a rather interesting woman (Shirley Eaton) who sets romantic sparks flying. Although director Eady and the cast have done their best with the story, it is too thin to survive even the short running time of 69 minutes.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
