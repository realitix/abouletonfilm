The editing procedure was to count the number of shots and start the film off with the numerically middle shot and then, after that, the shot that had preceded it, and the shot that had followed it, and to keep fanning further and further out until one saw the first shot of the film followed by the last shot, which was of the painting the movie is based on. It's called \"The Doctor\" and is in the Tate Gallery, London. The painting itself has an interesting subliminal image appropriate to what's revealed by my re-editing process of the real, if subliminal, story of the film.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/k2QsPeQ6oKtjgDh0aXmIjQEuImS.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
