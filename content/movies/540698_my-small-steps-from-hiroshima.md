He brought public figures from other countries together with survivors in postwar Hiroshima, even though he himself was born and raised in the U.S. The devastation shocked the visitors, causing them to spread the word internationally. They eventually began supporting the victims and joining in the anti-nuclear movement. The program recounts the life and work of those activists and the experiences of Kaoru Ogura.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
