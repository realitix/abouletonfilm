The inmates learn from one another. This is also the case with Egon Olsen, leader of the Olsen Gang. While he was in the slammer, he planned how he would steal the fantastic golden figure Keizeroppzatsen (worth 12 million) which was previously owned by the German emperor, and is now on display in Oslo.  The exhibition is heavily guarded with security systems, cameras and Inspector Hermansen. Yet somehow the Olsen-Gang manages to steal the figure, but Hermansen is on their trail.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/8uN1KnJVUf0GVh5r5YsVjD4OHST.jpg", "actors": ["Arve Opsahl (Egon Olsen)", "Carsten Byhring (Kjell Jensen)", "Sverre Holm (Benny Fransen)", "Sverre Wilberg (Hermansen)", "Aud Sch\u00f8nemann (Valborg Jensen)", "P\u00e5l Johannessen (Basse)", "Solfrid Heier (Ulla, Bennys forlovede)", "Georg Richter ()", "Ingeborg Cook ()", "Synn\u00f8ve Strigen ()", "Lillian Lydersen ()", "Kari-Laila Thorsen ()", "Ivar Medaas ()", "Willie Hoel ()", "Kari Diesen ()", "Stein Thorsrud ()", "Alf Hallgren ()", "Leif Enger ()", "Sverre Anker Ousdal ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [24668, 24672, 24670, 24666], "youtube_key": "NyqwOjjTbNI"}
