It deals with a bitter feud between two farmers who had taken opposite sides in the Irish Civil War many years before and who had also fought for the love of the same woman. When the feud is reawakened in the '50s it causes a major upheaval with tragic consequences for the lives of the two men, their families and the community.  As the story unfolds it embraces many of the great, lingering issues affecting Ireland in this century - the War of Independence, the Civil War, emigration, the links with America, the clash between traditional, conservative values and those of a new technological age.", "image": "/img/default-cover.png", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
