He struggles to change her situation and make a new life for her, and while doing so, they fall in love. Mohr struggles with his feelings for her, versus his commitment to God. Meanwhile, the Prior, Mohr's superior, whose corrupt dealings with the Baron von Seidl are threatened by Mohr's integrity and honesty, works (unsuccessfully) to falsely accuse Mohr of sexual misconduct with Magdalene, and thereby remove him from office. Meanwhile, Mohr and local schoolteacher Franz Gruber compose the hymn \"Silent Night\".", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/2I4qHFUUiaHBDWIUKTh6FX2hSMm.jpg", "actors": ["Steve Bond (Father Joseph Mohr)", "Nastassja Kinski (Magdalene)", "David Warner (Baron von Seidl)", "G\u00fcnter Meisner (Prior)", "Cyrus Elias (Franz Gruber)", "Katharina B\u00f6hm (Helga)", "Ferdy Mayne (Archbishop)", "Franco Nero (Janza)", "Anthony Quayle (Father Noessler)", "William Carr Hickey (Rudolf)", "Janet \u00c5gren (Anna)", "Max Tidof (Robert)", "Karina Szulc (Elisabeth)", "Ralf Weikinger (Baader)", "Ulrich G\u00fcnther (Hans)", "Armin Kraft (Konrad)", "Hans-Christoph von Goetz (Mauracher (as Christoph von Goetz))", "Francesca Ferre (Sophia)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "wiYpcMEFk9E"}
