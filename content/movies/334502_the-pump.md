Synopsis: A man is traveling alone in his car in Southern California. The year is 1947. He stops to look at his road map. The map warns him that no one should turn off the main roads without inquiring locally. The driver notices what looks like a short-cut on the map. He turns onto it. Soon his car has overheated and he is stalled - miles away from any help. The traveler walks away from the road apparently hoping to find another short-cut, cross-country. He brings no hat, no canteen, no provisions.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/qCkWLXcDjUz1BYlQN8AvnvBOXBy.jpg", "actors": ["Wayne Brennan (The Traveler)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
