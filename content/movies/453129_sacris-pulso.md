This film is an interpretation of Clarice Lispector's chronic \"Bras\u00edlia\", her vision of the modernist capital, as it is the film which marks the encounter of my mother, playing Lispector, and my father, composer of the film's sound score. Through the juxtaposition of \"Brasili\u00e1rios\" with a series of reassembled found footage, the film takes the form of a voyage of remembrance and imagination, of a past and future time dreamt between personal and collected materials, between memory and fiction.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/bSJieh0vddFS6iH74EqfM2L8moX.jpg", "actors": [], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
