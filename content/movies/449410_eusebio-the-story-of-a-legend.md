A kid kicked into rag balls and did not care much about school. This kid was called Eus\u00e9bio da Silva Ferreira and would become one of the best footballers of all time. This is the narrative of \"Eusebius - A History of a Legend\", a documentary film made by Filipe Ascens\u00e3o and that counted on the collaboration of Eusebio himself in the last years of his life, before dying, in January 2014. Released in the year in which Eusebio would be 75 years old, the film counts on testimonies of many people who have crossed with him, from Hil\u00e1rio da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, his childhood friend who would also be a footballer, to Bobby Charlton, opponent in the 1966 World Cup, passing by Antonio Sim\u00f5es, the \" White brother \"who accompanied him from Benfica to the end of his US career, and some of his Portuguese soccer heirs like Lu\u00eds Figo, Rui Costa and Cristiano Ronaldo.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/ydZlcTJSiZZSubgH4HuiueUGRM5.jpg", "actors": ["Cristiano Ronaldo ()", "Eus\u00e9bio ()", "Lu\u00eds Costa ()", "Rui Costa ()", "Bobby Charlton ()"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
