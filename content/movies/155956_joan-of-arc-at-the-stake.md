The film takes place mostly in a surrealistic fantasy around the time of the execution of Joan of Arc. Joan of Arc, played by Ingrid Bergman, is being burned alive for heresy. In a kind of dream state, she departs from her body and begins to look back upon her life. She begins this journey in a depressed and demoralized state. However, a priest appears to help guide her. First, he shows her those that accused her in the guise of animal characters, in order to show her their true nature. Then, he shows her the good that she has performed for people. In the end, she is proud of what she has done and is ready to face the flames.", "image": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185_and_h278_bestv2/lZB9UbrvzAxV9cIOSJC0rTD8JJa.jpg", "actors": ["Ingrid Bergman (Joan of Arc)", "Tullio Carminati (Fra Domenico)", "Giacinto Prandelli (Procus)", "Augusto Romani (gigante Heuterbise)"], "comments": [], "recommandations_id": [], "youtube_key": "notfound"}
